" Powerful and disturburing even if goes a little off the rails by the end.
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,7,"Never work with children and animals and once upon a time films featuring children and animals were so saccarine you might have said never watch films in which children and animals appear. In Kornel Mundruczo's ""Whiite God"" there is a child, (the excellent Zsofia Psotta), and an awful lot of animals, (in this case, dogs), but there is nothing saccarine about this powerful Hungarian film; indeed the complete opposite is true. This violent, adult movie is sure to upset animal lovers and it's certainly not aimed at children.It begins when Lili, (Psotta), goes to stay with her estranged father, bringing her beloved dog with her but her father refuses to keep the dog in the apartment and lets it loose to roam the streets of Budapest leaving Lili to search for him. Mundruczo's film is like an X-rated version of ""Lassie Come Home"". It begins benignly enough even if there is an underlying tension between the characters, (Lili is one of the very few sympathetic people onscreen and even she isn't particularly likeable), before moving into much darker, surreal horror-movie territory. Disturbing as these climatic scenes are, I feel the film and its message would have been better served with a more realistic apporach. Still, it makes for suitably uneasy viewing while the dogs themselves 'perform' quite magnificently."
" Very good, if not fully satisfying
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,7,"'White God,' or 'Feher isten,' beckons with a promising premise: A young girl's father puts her beloved dog out on the streets, and he must learn to survive as she looks for him. Every film poster, and the first visuals we see in the movie, further promise rather harrowingly that every dog really does have its day.That is, certainly, the film we get. But it nonetheless seems to fall a little short of expectations.Most notable about 'White god' are the human and canine leads. Bodie and Luke are the two dogs who accordingly portray Hagen in the film, and they have been expertly trained and are very convincing in their roles. More relatable is Zsofia Psotta as human protagonist Lili. She shines in her performance struggling with an overbearing father who doesn't listen, and determined to find her beloved companion. We feel Lili's frustration, exasperation, and anguish very keenly, emotions readily given life with the young star's capable skill.Whether one is an animal lover or just especially empathetic around humans, this is a film that's not particularly easy to watch. The experiences of Hagen being tossed out of his home, and what he faces living on the streets, is heart-breaking to see played out on the screen. Likewise, again, Lili's troubles are very understandable: we've all had difficulties with parental figures, and the very idea of losing a pet is almost too much to bear.The emotional element makes the narrative extra exciting as it runs toward the climax: We look forward to seeing Hagen and his new friends find triumph, and there's great anticipation of Lili being reunited with him. Yet this is unfortunately where 'White god' falters a bit.We don't quite get the catharsis we were hoping for. Hagen and the other dogs get a chance to give as good as they got as they run the streets, but it doesn't reach the crescendo that we want it to be. Lili does find Hagen, but their reunion doesn't induce the burst of heartfelt tears we expect to find ourselves having.The ending itself is very satisfying, and ultimately the perfect capstone for the film, especially from a purely artistic viewpoint. Still, after 2 hours of watching Lili and Hagen endure hardship, we want a greater sense of resolution than we get. As a result, as good as the movie is, we're left feeling a bit unfulfilled.Although imperfect, 'White god' is absolutely worth watching. One should note a content warning for animal cruelty, and a bit of blood, but it's all movie magic: Apart from the trained canine stars, every dog that appears on the screen was a shelter pet that found a home after production wrapped. Now there's a happy ending!"
" I have never seen anything like this ever in film or in real life!
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,10,"I came here cause of 'Pieces of a Woman' and that was so good, the writing, i'm here because of the writing and got so much more! But um, I just love this ladie's writing, in this there ware three credits but in the movie at the end her name seems to be first which would be the reason why this is so good and also Pieces of a Woman is so very good as well! I love this one just as much as the other one and I can't decide which one is the best out of the two there is one more between both of these but out of both I would say Pieces is a bit more gorgeous writing but this is more fun to watch! I love both though! This lady is so talented my heart goes out to her and her loved ones I hope as a fan of storytelling to be around long enough to enjoy everything this lady is involved in if by gods good graces I am able to I know I will enjoy them vastly! Love you so much!"
" Interesting first half, rushed second half.
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"I really wanted to love this movie unequivocally. Sincerely. I love dogs, and the trailer made it seem dogs were taking over. However, what we got instead was a muddied coming of age narrative that was rushed and out of place.The story begins with Lili spending three months with her father. They are estranged, strained and even divisive against each other. It's clear her mother did not think this through and thus feels like a contrived plot point. Early on in the story, the film seems to be an indictment of totalitarianism, which was coming out of the wood works in Hungary at the time and ultimately led to their current government. It's wild how things work out from hindsight years later. Anyway, her father hates the dog Hagen (which means youthful one in Gaelic) and throws into the open world.This leads to the part of the movie I really enjoyed. As Hagen is turned into a fighting dog Lili starts rebelling in purposeful ways. It's an obvious metaphor since they were each the moral anchors in each other's life, but it is still played out in a non-over the top manner. The descent for each is gradual and terrifying. I was literally uncomfortable for what might happen to Lili, more so than Hagen.After Lili is found drunk at an underground party, I was a little taken aback by the direction they took her father. He was remorseful and then tried overcompensating, which would be normal in such a situation. But then the wheels fell off a little.I know they blew their budget on training dogs and various dog rotoscoping, but I wish they had had a little more time to establish the threat of Hagen's army. Like maybe stretch it out over a couple more days and such. In all honesty the limitations pushed the narrative too quickly and Hagen's army would not have been deemed so dangerous in a short period of time like that. But that is just nitpicking from me.The end of the film was extremely sad. The pied piper narrative is brutal in this moment. The dogs will surely be slaughtered and their mixed breed will continue to be vilified within the story's world. Totalitarian rule will continue.My only other wish is that maybe the movie could have made some commentary about why so many strays become so prevalent in cities like Palermo, Italy, Moscow and various Eastern European capitals. But I guess you cannot put too much commentary into such a small film. Either way, solid 7/10 in my book."
" Dog toll too high.
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,7,"You never know a film until you view it. I like the concept of Dogs uprising after being treated inhumanly, But I feel White Dog handled the issues very irresponsibly. Even though I wanted an adult themed Disney tale, there are simply too many deaths. Maybe bc I'm American, but it just stews too much hate when dogs die. Even with a wonderful lead by a young actress (Zsófia Psotta), clever dog techniques, inspiring cinematography, and sewing in some zombie tropes... the message is jeopardized by making the uprising too aggressive. This could instill the idea that man (white man) is right and dogs (immigrants) are dangerous. This is what could get convoluted for a viewer. Finally giving our protagonists a fateful end of death & displacement. Likely just death. Disrupts what the final message should be, and that's hope. Director Kornél Mundruczó message might be exactly that. Disparaging hope.
In film, especially when you use dogs, there is a certain responsibility. That is to not lose your audience. I realize I'm speaking from an American stance, but this film could of been a global hit if the reigns were pulled back just a bit.
All that being said, White God made a lasting impression that I will not soon forget. I will love on my dogs a little more... maybe that's all the point, but I will not recommend this film, and that is a hard fault."
" Doggone it - homeless hounds and strained familial relations run wild in this bold Hungarian drama.
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,6,"Funny how 'God' is 'Dog' backwards. The title, ""White God"", an often shocking, though not gratuitous or exploitative, Hungarian drama seems to allude to the idea that dogs gaze upon human-beings as Gods: the keepers of sustenance; harbingers of healthcare; source of entertainment; in equal part capable of both love and wrath. How does one pitch the film? Try to image ""Homeward Bound"", in Hell, with just the lone mutt by himself. Did I enjoy the experience? I suppose so. Will everybody? I doubt it.Certainly, from a technical standpoint, the film is quite stunning: the logistics involving large packs of dogs are impressively coordinated; the way the film conveys an animal's perspective of the world from the lower levels of the city streets is totally convincing and, most unnervingly, fights between dogs are realistic. It is certainly too sophisticated to be a genre or an exploitation film, so don't be fooled by any promotional material you might have uncovered of it being a 'dogs rising up' horror piece; instead, expect something more nuanced - something which dips into suburban family drama when it isn't treading close to the boundaries of what many might consider to be in good taste.""White God"" opens with some imagery which, I suppose, is designed to sell the film as some kind of horror piece: streets are empty, cars lie abandoned - everyone has disappeared. The whole thing has a sense of ""28 Days Later"" about it, suggesting something apocalyptical has happened or that we have lost control of society. From nowhere, a young girl cycles through, looking for something, and our appetites are whetted: just how did we get to this point? The film then flashes back to happier times: warm lighting on a summer's day and play in a park between young Lili (Zsófia Psotta) and her dog Hagen. She is dropped off by her mother at her father's house for a few weeks, her parents separated: we sense they are two very different people, in that she is off to Australia for a business conference - a high-flying, ladder-climbing modern woman - and he works in an abattoir.We sense Lili and her father, played by Sándor Zsótér, have lost touch - the girl is perhaps, taking more after her mother than her father. He has bought for her a bottle of bubble-making fluid, inferring some time has passed between when last they met - she rejects it; she's 'not a little kid anymore.' Director Kornél Mundruczó moves things on to band-practise after Lili's father and neighbours take a disliking to the dog, impressively constructing a makeshift orchestra of sixth-formers building to a resounding climax while Hagen has been hidden in a cupboard and the conductor has been introduced as a teacher who does not take to fooling around. Back at home, Hagen is proving to be a problem - the government require legislature for dogs at properties, something father isn't prepared to pay for on account of despising his ex-wife. The situation comes to a hilt; Lili's ego gets the better of her, and the-actually-quite-amicable solution of leaving Hagen with a kennel for a smaller fee is binned for merely abandoning him at the side of the road.What is curious about the film at this juncture is that it fractures into two separate strands: Hagen's misadventures as a vagrant hound and Lili's coming to terms with what has happened on top of her naturally unfolding life anyway. We follow Hagen around for a while, watching him make friends with other strays; salivate over sausages in the windows of butcher shops and dodge being caught by the pound, before things take an especially nasty turn. Mundruczó depicts all this in conjunction with Lili's life, as she struggles with the adult world and clashes with authority figures - inferring in the process a bind between the two and how, irrespective of your species, survival is hard-going.It would be wrong to say that the harshly juxtaposed nature of either strand hurts the film, just that it is depicting, on the one hand, a rather harrowing narrative of life as a stray animal and, on the other, telling the story of an uneasy house-bound situation involving an adolescent and her father, the sort of story which might soar in its own feature. In opening the film with a rather dramatic edit from Lili playing in a park with Hagen to her father working at the slaughter-house, Mundruczó seems to attempt to highlight the fine-line between the roles animals play in our society: we love them and they are our companions, but we are cold and detached enough to kill others for the purposes of food. This is toyed with later on when a new owner of Hagen demonstrates his love for the dog when it turns out to be an especially good fighter.It is, ultimately, a little tricky to know what to make of the film - it has its moments but it wobbles in what it's doing too often to awe us. Its balancing act, of that of a relationships drama between father and daughter and teenager and dog, is as good as it probably could have been without focussing solely on just the one strand and ignoring the other. What, for instance, happens to all the dogs once the events of the film have transpired? Additionally, I would doubt whether Lili's father would be a new-found convert to the blighters. Regardless, there is certainly something to be said about ""White God""."
" A good start and a magic ending is not enough: where's the movie in the middle?
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,5,"This is the kind of movie I'd like to compliment and give a good rating, because it proposes something different that most.
But originality is not enough by itself and a good and intriguing start scene + a magical and poetic end scene is a bit too meager to deserve more in my opinion.
Of course, I do understand the parallel with Hungary political and societal situation and the denunciation of this Hungarian first 'pure race' policy. And that deserves a better story too.Start scene is indeed intriguing enough to make you curious for a portion of the first half - portion that will both depend on how curious you are and how fast it will be debuffed by the following: almost any of the scenes involving human together smells fishy and lacks both realism and logic!
And, if I could understand a non-realistic movie, I do not believe that was the intent.
Examples are numerous but the set-up is already so unbelievable that I stopped immediately to care about the characters beside the dog. What made believe any guy involved in the movie that two divorced parents would never talk and organize the moving for a few months of their daughter? Speak about her animal, that does not resume to be a goldfish in its bowl?
That a father seeming to care about his daughter and surprised the mother will not attend her concert, will then be odious as soon as she will be with him? It would have been clearly better to start of with a decision of the local authorities to forbid mix-breed completely (instead of taxing them) and moving from there. Blaming the father is clearly only a minor thing in the movie anyway.There are however some interesting scene when we follow the dog's adventures, some hard to look at and in these can be noticed the attention to detail, to realism. Nothing though that has never been told.
The rest of the scenes - father/daughter, the daughter's friend, the discotheque... - none of these seems really true nor with a meaning in the movie. Of course, we could not completely loose sight of the daughter, but showing her still searching her dog would have been better than these - that or a better script.And at some point, a surnatural event happen (why not, but why trying to keep everything before realistic - and so poorly - then?). No explanation given but still I can accept it.
From that point, I can only admire the directing of all these dogs, this is impressive.Regarding the movie, still, the message given is unclear for me. Is it that, once smart enough, animals will only think about revenge? That as human decided to treat them on an ""animal"" basis, they decides to reciprocate and apply the 'an eye for an eye' rule?
And finally the movie is saved from a terrible wreck thanks to the last scene."
" This is a director to watch out for.
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,8,A very good film. Had me on the edge of my seat in some moments and crying real tears in others. I sure am looking forward to this director's future projects. The movie is not without flaws but it sure is damn good. Think of it as a type of Lord of the Flies but with dogs.
" great final scene. sad movie.reccomended.
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,9,"Don't read to much about the movie.
supposedly most dogs got adopted after movie(they are from shelters) +1!
I think young as
actress was good for part.
incredible how well the dogs are trained.
some gore in movie sadly from dog fights. but coming from a small county, it make sense to show it for added impact. chek out Amores Perro for another good title wt a dog in it."

" Impressive European theatre
",2018-12-20 00:00:00,10,"It's almost impossible to find fault with this little gem. As such its hard to review. The lead, between a girl and a woman, is a magnificent actor, playing the role of a somewhat desensitised child, newly in love with her new pet dog. The dog, the other hero, is charming. The portrayal of dogs on the whole walks a fine balance between normal dog traits and finding qualities more associated with humans. This is also a cautionary tale and is brilliant social commentary. It's also a tale of redemption between an estranged parent and his daughter. The ending is brilliant. Many of the scenes are worthy of a blockbuster, yet overall it retains its essentially European character throughout. The photography is beautiful.I could go on, and on. Brilliant movie."
" Love will save us not hatred
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,8,It is really hard to rate this movie. You don't know to rate it because of its story and other technicalities or what dogs gone through. It amazingly portrayed what dogs face everyday. And also it has so much meaning that told through dogs.
" Don't confound with White Dog but the topic is nearly the same
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,10,"Yes folks, Don't confound this feature speaking about wild dogs with Sam Fuller's WHITE DOG and speaking about the nearly same scheme. Both are masterpieces anyway."
" Flawed but fascinating
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,6,"Striking modern viewers with a forceful impact, WHITE GOD is a film that dog lovers should fear: it presents a taut and realistic tale of canine oppression and brutality that builds to some satisfying moments, but nonetheless presents near-endless animal cruelty along the way. As a dog lover myself I found it a tough watch, the kind of film that wears its heart on its sleeve for the most part. This overlong Hungarian allegorical tale offers a cautionary fable about the necessity of treating animals well and the consequences that can occur when they're treated badly. The scenes featuring the little girl are repetitive and endless and unnecessary, but the scenes with the dogs are spot on, harking back to classic stories like THE PLAGUE DOGS and WHITE DOG. What's most remarkable is that they were shot via live action with some wonderfully convincing performances from the dogs themselves."
" Might work as a short
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,2,"The TV channel showing this described it as a 'drama' and a quick check of the IMDb score of 6.9 convinced me to at least give it a go. I tend not to look much further than that so as to minimise preconceptions, although with hindsight I wish I'd noticed that the IMDb genre also made mention of fantasy and horror, which ain't my thing. It starts not unpromisingly as a teen girl and her beloved dog are thrust upon her father by his ex-wife while she flies off for some extended work project abroad. The mongrel (there are a few references to its race) is unwelcome to Dad and his apartment administrator and is kicked out to fend for itself on the streets. A rather confusing couple of hours ensued watching an unconvincing tale of animal abuse and revenge. I grew increasingly dismayed as the father/daughter story, which had potential, was overshadowed by the 'fantasy' and 'horror' elements in the dog's story. I even mistook it for (unfunny) comedy at first (I often struggle to know if a scene is meant to inspire horror or laughter). I guess the dog's the star and if you like your animals imbued with human qualities and taking the lead role, this may be for you. Even so, the story itself lacks any real drama and disappoints at just about every turn, taking the most obvious/ridiculous, but not the most interesting. There are so many scenes of inconsequence that it begs the question whether it needs 2 hours. 10-15 mins would probably do the trick."
" A lost-dog adventure story turns into an affecting allegory for a slave-revolt in ""White God.""
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,7,"""White God"" relates the tale of a mixed-breed dog who is separated from his owner in a city where dogs -- and especially mutts -- are quite unloved. It is equal parts adventure story, political allegory, fairy-tale, and revenge-flick. Its very loaded title serves as both a provocation, and as an invitation into the film's allegory. On the surface, ""White God"" is a traditional lost-dog story, concerning the trials an animal must endure before being re- united with his caretaker. Just under the surface, it is the story of a slave- revolt.The film's allegory is established quite early in the film. Lili is dropped-off by her mom at her estranged father's flat, beloved pooch Hagen in-tow. Lily is a quiet teen with thoughtful eyes. Hagen is a cheerful brown Labrador/Shar-Pei mix. Lily's father has zero love for the dog. He is, apparently, a regulator who certifies meat as fit or unfit for consumption. We first see him overseeing the processing of a beef carcass; this, it would seem, sums-up his feelings about animals. Nonetheless, he humors his daughter on the first night, allowing Hagen to stay -- but neighbors soon spy the dog in his apartment and threaten to report him. ""That's a mixed- breed,"" one of them says, ""A street-dog. Is he registered? You know it's illegal to have an unregistered mutt in this building.""Such sentiment runs pervasively throughout the film, and it seems a little heavy-handed -- until you clue-into the fact that this isn't ""really"" a film about a dog. It's actually an encoded film about prejudice, slavery, and the violence begat by both. As such, the film makes a pretty interesting watch. Its story is well-told -- and once Hagen is out on his own, the film wordlessly observes him, letting his story play out without narration or any such clunky storytelling device. It reminded me of certain classics of the animal-adventure genre, such as ""The Bear"" (1988). Some of the mistreatment which befalls Hagen is hard to watch; at one point he's captured and trained to fight, and then made to kill another dog in the ring. There is a parallel to be drawn here to the gladiatorial combat of Roman slaves, but that doesn't make the (simulated) violence go down any easier. Later, Hagen escapes from the city pound -- and as hundreds of freed-and-grateful pooches follow in his path, Hagen leads the mob on a kind of revenge-rampage through the streets. This might have easily turned corny, but the film's allegory keeps this material affecting, even as the plot itself takes a few unlikely turns. And then, happily, the film finds exactly the right note upon which to end -- meaningfully satisfying the requirements of both its dog- adventure story and its allegory, simultaneously.Critic Matt Zoller Seitz called the film an ""R-rated 'Lassie' by way of 'Spartacus,'"" and as far as summaries go, that's a pretty good one. He admired the film, giving it 3.5 of 4 stars. On that scale, I'd probably rank it a solid 3. It's an utterly unique film -- one which, incidentally, will be quite difficult for some people to watch, given the (simulated) depictions of violence involving animals."
" Think Twice before watching
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,1,"Like what every other reviewer is saying about this film, there were a lot of missteps. I'm going to preface... that I have never seen a Hungarian film before, I appreciate my heroic films of the U.S.A., and I care for my own dog and never want anything to happen to her. With that, I thought the story was lacking a message and if the message was about dogs, I don't get it because if you care about dogs like I do then this movie only creates problems, not corrects them. The Hungarian film industry may have a different idea of perseverance and love through hardship than I do. Going into the movie I expected a bond between girl and pet. I expected to see immense sorrow when the two are separated. I expected a girl to go to her wits end to find the dog. I expected the city faced with a canine revolt to examine the error of their ways and I expected a resolution at the end of the film and not just a concrete nap between dog, girl, and father. I got none of that. There wasn't much of a bond. The trumpet playing may be the one ingredient to a 'bond theory'. When the two are separated, there is not a lot of remorse in Lili's voice. I would be a blubbering mess if I was in her condition. The girl puts up fliers to find him but gives up halfway through to attend 2 parties. If the dog was that important to you, would you shrug shoulders and dodge into the nearest club? And when she does decide to do something about it, the entire city is shut down and the swat team has convinced itself that to handle the situation they must kill without self-evaluation. After these events, do Hungarians care for all pets? Is animal brutality done away with? What about that tax, does that go away? This is what the conclusion should've covered but it didn't. I'll also throw in that, though the animal brutality was instrumental to the dog's journey I didn't like it one bit. Like I said, I love the wholesome story telling of Hollywood pictures so this was a shocker. I wanted to see a physical and emotional journey for Hagan, I really did, but I didn't ask for that much. When Hagan is being trained for dog fights, I had to look away. Most can argue that it was necessary to see gore and death in Hagan's odyssey but, by watching it, did I rectify the situation or did I just watch a bloody dog fight? Some questions left unanswered 1. Why does this dystopian city hate half breeds so much? 2. If the mother knew her ex-husband would have a hard time housing the dog why didn't she make more preparations? 3. Was there meant to be romantic tension between Lili and Peter? 4. How did the healing process between Lili and her father come so quickly? 5. Hagan sees the error of his ways for killing his canine opponent so he goes on a human killing rampage? Right... 6.Could Lili not change in a bathroom or do all pubescent girls change in front of their fathers? 7. Was there meant to be a connection between the slaughterhouse and the dog revolt? 8. Just pay a TAX!! will it kill the father to pay a tax for 3 months? Obviously, I didn't care for the movie at all and I wished I didn't see it through to the end. It was a waste of storytelling and a waste of time."
" Hagen the Everydog
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,7,"Thematically, foreign films in the U.S. gain acclaim for universality. In the past, directors had pressure from their own country to stay true to their local form while studios wanted to appeal to the huge market in America. Therefore it is an impressive feat that the independent film ""White God"" out of Hungary is unmistakably European in style and execution, while dealing with unanimously effective subject matter. Cruelty to animals transcends language and customs as a viscerally hated act. However, one man's sacred cow is another man's steak. There are only a handful of species that bridge these gaps. Number 1 with a bullet is man's best friend. Dogs in ""White God"" are seen as little more than a nuisance in Urban Hungary. The used plot of an adolescent going to stay with the lesser of two divorced parents is less establishing the setting here, and more lulling you into a false state familiarity. Lili is all friction with here jaded father, and his disdain for her only friend Hagen is palpable. Hagen is the Jimmy Stuart of dogs. Not in the ""Greatest Dog Actor of All Time"" sense, but in the sense that he is the ""Everydog."" He is lovable, loyal, appropriately misbehaved, and expressive. And since the beginning of filmmaking, any character that provokes this level of emotional involvement will have to take some licks to build conflict. And man does this dog take some licks (Pun shamelessly intended). Lili's father is human but questionably humane in his actions of turning this dog away, adding him to the throng of strays in the city. From the moment of their separation, Lili and Hagen begin to break traditions as ""lost pup"" and ""sad little girl."" After the mandatory dodging of the dogcatcher, Hangar gets put through the ringer. His struggles against humanity become a statement against humanity very gradually and unrelentingly. Apart from the singular brutality that Hagen endures, originality is apparent in Lili's life juxtaposed to her lost dog.Lili isn't pigeonholed into the ""Lost Dog Poster"" wielding girl for 2 hours. She is more than a girl that lost her pup. She is a talented musician, spiteful daughter, sexually confused co-ed, and part of the world that is putting her best friend through hell. Her struggles are tame compared to those of Hagen, but relatable as a teen experience. She is not defined by her lost dog and we are torn between understanding and cynicism for her among these mirrored conflicts. This film is ever-building to the degree of farce by the end. There are customs and specific rules that are foreign to us in the US; but everything that matters is instantly relatable. We can argue that our immediate environment is more conscientious to the vulnerable than this world; but if you can get to the last frame of this film without an ache of guilt, being a White God has done you no favors."
