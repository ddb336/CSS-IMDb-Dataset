" Boyhood would have worked better as a miniseries on IFC.
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,7,"Boyhood was an interesting experiment about watching Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater grow up, but it didn't have enough entertainment value to justify watching it. However, I found the girl, Samantha, to be a lot more entertaining than the boy, Mason, on whom Boyhood focuses. She really stole most of the scenes she was in, and unlike the rest of the movie's narrative, I think Lorlei was talented and entertaining enough for Richard Linklater to justify casting her as Mason's sister, even if the main story didn't really need her. Actually, it probably needed her more than we think. We should help Lorelei get better parts in more interesting movies that do not write two chapters every year. When Boyhood neared the end, my mom and I both felt sad like Olivia, hoping there would be more for us to do and experience after Samantha and Mason went to college, than just waiting around in loneliness forever for her funeral to come. Life moves very fast when you watch 12 years of non-escapist stuff in the span of 2 1/2 hours. There was more life and laughs even in WandaVision, and that was all about facing grief in reality and...Vision dying twice. The only other item of note in Boyhood: A mini-storyline with Roland Ruiz as Enrique, the only person of color with a speaking part, is a bit guilty of the ""white savior to a person of color"" cliche, in addition to Boyhood being unusually white for a movie filmed and set in Texas, but Roland Ruiz spoke in defense of Richard Linklater's backstory and interpretation, which was the exact opposite of Grisel Acosta's. Not to say that her interpretation was wrong, because both of them could be right. Roland went through that immigration experience in real life, and we should give his character more credit because immigrants like Enrique do not just wait around to be ""saved"" by white people. He didn't give Olivia credit for everything just because she gave him a compliment that marked a shift in his life. He was sincere and spoke from his heart when he thanked her for giving him a nudge in the right direction. She told him what he needed to hear to turn his life around, but he wasn't a helpless Latino waiting for her to be his ""white savior."""
" Its nothing like you have ever seen
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,9,The movie doesnt have a plot line or any action and no the boy doesnt turn into superman after a traumatic childhood and save the world.This movie is unique and creative and brings something fresh on the table and thats why i love it.
" The film is good, but it won the Oscar because it is a film of leftist ideology that was made to support the American Democratic party.
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,7,"O filme é bom, mas ganhou o Óscar porque é um filme de ideologia esquerdista que foi feito para apoiar o partido democrata americano.
A dicção de alguns atores ruim, dificultando o entendimento do Inglês. The film is good, but it won the Oscar because it is a film of leftist ideology that was made to support the American Democratic party.
The diction of some actors is bad, making it difficult to understand English."
" 12 years of beautiful
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,"A movie that sets from a boy to until he's off to college, and they used the same actors/actresses over the 12 years, such a beautiful movie, I highly recommend if you love film"
" Perfec time for just me watch this movie!
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,9,"So i wanted to write about Boyhood for so many reason's.
I just finally watched it and i can say that i loved it very much.This post contains some nods towards the movie.I think that now was just perfect time to watch this movie for me.
I'm now 19 years old and i was born at 2001.
So i'm some years younger than main character Mason would be nowdays.
But i'm now around same age that Mason was af ending of movie.
I still feel that i growed up pretty similar times that Mason did in movie.
I found so many things where i can relate with him.
My mom read Harry Potter to me when i was child. I did dress up to Harry Potter for some parties.
We discussed about Star Wars with my friends when i was child. We totally had those discussions who is cooler Grievous or Yoda.
I had many hobbies when i was younger. I even collected rocks.
My parents divorced when i was young so i related with children's in this movie so much.
Dad figure was kinda similar to me. More like friend than dad.
I can see diffrent peoples around me in so many characters in this movie.
Of course there is many cultural differences because i lived my childhood in Finland and not USA but i can still see so much same.
Was so nice to see technological advancements that i also lived through.
This movie just brought so many memories to me from my childhood. Some good and some bad ones.
I also thinked lot about my future when i was watching.Just so good movie.
Yes i have seen movies that were probably more entertaining but i just loved how this movie was made.
I cried many times but mostly for happibes.
9/10 movie for me.
I think that some older peoples don't probably appreciate it as much as i did because they lived their childhood in different time.If you are still reading this very long post i appreciate a lot.
Thank you!"
" Some reviews say ""this is life"" REALLY ?
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,1,"Whoever says that this movie is the representation of life, I give you some advice ladies and gentlemen, go out and have a life, take an adventure, take a risk. Because if for you ""life"" is so frikin boring where nothing ever happens, you don't take risks, you don't fight for what you want, you don't get excited, you don't achieve, nor win, or loose , nor do you have high goals, that's just sad, as evidenced in this triple boring movie"
" Great project, but not as good as I expected
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,6,"The film is without a doubt an impressive and innovative project and deserves respect for that. But as innovative as the idea is, the actual story remains generic. The film is incredibly realistic, but at its core it remains an arbitrary, interchangeable story of a childhood, made up of the same elements as seen in so many films."
" I teared a ""10/10 rating""
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,10,How do i release this cinema satisfaction in my vein? I will never look at the things with the same way anymore.
" I want another 3 hours of this art
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,9,"This movie is amazing, it just give you a story which contain some clasic cliché. Seeing the evolution of these kids makes me feel good about what I achieved until now. Theres a -1 because I feeled rushed between some scene change - I know it got ~150min of movie -, but I could watch another 3 hours of this, presenting suff like getting the GTO back, finish college."
" One of the most bourgeois films I've seen
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,4,"I think I would be embarrassed in any universe to write something like ""you told me I'm smart and to study and now I'm successful so you saved me"".
I really really disliked this movie, and not because of nothing happening, which was actually the only cool thing about it, like seeing their lives as a neighbor. But I don't understand how this movie which touches the american reality only superficially and includes pretentious dialogues and forced character development is supposed to be a masterpiece. Especially with all the potential it had."
" Criticts
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,9,"I still can't believe this movie is real. richard linklater made a film that took 13 years of shooting as you know it even further after the before sunrise trilogy. He met with the characters every year, and at the end, a very cute movie came out in which he describes how a child grows from the age of 5 to the age of 18 in very fine details and his unique funny language. Watching the character change every year and the fact that everything is very real makes the movie fascinating. When the director decided to shoot this film, he did not know that the before sunrise series would continue, and after seeing that he could shoot this movie, he decided to shoot Before Sunset.The director has spoken about his childhood a lot while writing the film. Since he has lived in Houston since he was born, he presented how a child will grow up in Texas under such conditions that the 163-minute film can be watched almost without getting bored. The shooting of this production as a masterpiece for american indie cinema without any help or sponsorship of Hollywood makes it even more special. I can say a nirvana point for cinema lovers. Meanwhile, it will determine the continuation of the film, the manhood, according to the audience reaction of the film."
" It's a good movie, you should watch it.
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,5,"The title and the score doesn't make sense one with the other, let me explain:
They all tried to make something deep, but there was something missing.The idea of using the same actors through 13 years it's impressive, but with so much time it's hard to focus on an objective, they almost lost the way in the middle, but they managed to follow the path and to deliver a good movie.The thing is, I felt like it should have choose different events in his life, maybe focusing more on the grown Mason, his years at university/college, maybe shifting, filming from when he was 10yo to 23yo.This film was something very big, I got it, there was lot of good stuff, but the end made me so angry, because of this waste of potential.
So yes, this is a rage vote.PS: Hero, Family of the year it's one of the best song I ever heard."
" Shallow
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,5,"It isn't a bad movie, but I couldn't feel enough connection with the protagonist. The emotional side of the situations should have been more explored."
" Some good bits, but a bit tiring
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,7,"I think it is a great concept, but I actually got bored. There are a lot of famous people and the director is good, but after watching at the beginning I somehow stopped caring. I really like the idea as I said, I just think it was too long and there were parts that just became banal. Most of the acting was good, but again there were parts that got lost and the direction good, but not always helping the actors toward the end."
" I don't know why but I loved it
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"This is one of those movies that I just didn't want to end. Pure, unadulterated experience."
" Not Terrible, but Disappointing
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,7,"For a movie that took over a decade to make, I expected a little more. By no means was it terrible, but the plot was essentially the same as any other coming of age movie. I'm not going to waste time naming all of its good parts, so here are my problems with Boyhood.First, the character development. Aside from Patricia Arquette (who was absolutely phenomenal), all the characters remained very one dimensional. Especially Mason, who kept the same philosophical perspective on life in every single scene. I would have liked to have seen him try new things and experiment a little more.Also, in the beginning of the film, it felt like the actors had never seen the script before. Much of the dialogue felt very unnatural. The younger actors eyes darted around a little too much, but that's understandable considering how young they were.My third problem is about the script. When Mason and his sister were still very young, all the adults talked to them as if they were in their 20s. After awhile it started to become annoying, and was a continuous reminder that it was just a movie.Overall, it was a good movie with a few faults. I wish Richard Linklater had spent a little more time working on certain scenes. This movie is relatable to people at all different points in life."
" Very Boring
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,1,"This movie was beyond boring. I kept waiting for something, anything, to happen..but nothing did. It was so boring and it was so long. This movie had such great ratings and such great reviews, I thought for sure it was going to be awesome. It was not. I wish I had the three hours of my life back. What a waste of time watching this movie. My life story was more exciting this plie of garbage. People really need to stop giving high ratings to undeserving movies. If you want something to help you sleep, watch this."
" Simply Artistic.
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,"Boyhood may be the most artistic movie that have ever been shot in the United States. Not because of its screenplay, or casting -but exactly because of the concept it has created. It's such an awesome experience to observe a coming-to-age of a boy, and being with him through 12 years. Some people say the leading actor is time, which I do agree with."
" Does this ""movie"" touch my inner child? Or, is it just another boring and overrated mess?
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,4,"""Boyhood"" (2014), before I get into my review, there's just one thing I want to point out. I did enjoy this ""film"" somewhat when I first saw it. Richard Linklater, who is the writer, producer and director of this ""film"", definitely deserves credit and praise for his 12 years of hard work with making this ""movie"". That's quite a commitment and it should not go without a shoutout. It was such an ambitious undertaking with great potential and you really have to give him some serious props! If only all of that dedication was worth it in the end. Honestly, once you get past the hype of this ""film"" taking 12 years to put together, there is next to nothing salvageable at all. ""Boyhood"" has a very boring and jumbled storyline, average to stilted acting, and a generic cliched soundtrack. As for the plot, or lack thereof, it's about a boy named Mason, played by Ellar Coltrane. It shows him growing up, and that's it. I'm serious, for a ""film"" that's nearly three hours in length, very little to nothing happens. There is literally no storyline except watching a boy grow 12 years older, along with the other actors and actresses around him. Now, there are movies and shows out there with lack of plot that are much more entertaining than this. There is a right way to make a movie or TV show with a lack of plot, and ""Boyhood"" is one of the worst examples of how not to do it. Similar to one of the biggest problems with ""Jaws"" (1975), the script was incomplete when the ""film"" was green-lit. Wow, you would think after that, film makers would've learned their lesson! You can't make a movie without a completed script, or at the very least, a full draft. It goes entirely against film making protocol! Actually, what Richard Linklater did was, after each subsequent year of production, he would add on to the script for the next occurring year and tell the story as it progressed naturally. That's an interesting idea, evolving a storyline during the process of production. But, I personally think that there should have been a fully completed script before production was even close to being green-lit. As I said, it didn't have to be a final script, but it could have given this ""movie"" a more well-rounded resemblance of a plot besides just watching characters age 12 years on the screen. As for the acting, it's overall just as big a disappointment. The best performances come from Ethan Hawke, Patricia Arquette and Ellar Coltrane. They seem to be the only ones who actually appear to be trying. But, the best performance comes from Ethan Hawke as Mason Evans Sr. His energetic and positive attitude that he brings into this role really stands out and almost makes up for the lackluster supporting actors and actresses. Ellar Coltrane as Mason Evans Jr. also does a great job in this ""movie"". His acting did start off a little slow when he was younger. But, as he got older and matured, his acting gradually got better. Patricia Arquette also gives a really strong performance as Olivia, Mason's mother. She does get a little over-dramatic at times, but all-in-all, she did a decent job. Sadly, all of the other actors and actresses are just average to bad with their acting. The main characters may give the best performances in this ""film"", but the supporting characters matter too. Remember, main actors are only as good as their supporting actors. The soundtrack is a generic and cliched mess. There are a few good songs here and there, but for the most part, it's just nothing to write home about. One song in particular, is a standout amongst the others in the supposed tone of the ""film"", called: ""Hero"", by Family of the Year. That song shows that the score was on the right track, but besides that, there is hardly anything memorable in the soundtrack. Now, let's get to the positives in this ""movie"". The only two positives are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are nice and reflect the aging time period of the plot and give this ""movie"" a decent atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects are perfect. Being a movie made in 2014, that's not surprising! Great sets/locations and special effects are no excuses for lackluster screenwriting and acting. ""Boyhood"" is a movie that had serious potential, however, it was ultimately just a waste of 12 years. I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Before I wrap things up, I just wanted to say this one last time. The fact that Richard Linklater stayed dedicated to this production for 12 years is a huge feat in itself and he deserves credit for that. Plus, it is cool to watch the actors and actresses age naturally on-screen. There are just two crucial elements missing here though: a storyline and acting."
" Nothing Special. Just life!

" good not great
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,3,"I see a lot of people rave about this movie but i was less than impressed. the writing wasn't realistic to me and the acting was really really bad in my opinion. i do think the idea was great and it was executed well, as well as there being great character development. but the acting just left me not impressed."
" Very long and boring!
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,6,"Well done and good acting but really not interesting.
Facts of everyday life. Is that what you want to see in a movie? Look at yourself in a mirror then. I was not able to watch till the end. Boring! Boring!"
" 12 years old to produce a masterpiece
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,9,Boyhood movie could boring some times but you can't understand the meaning of the movie until you see the character getting older and going through life experience
" A special film
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,9,"Richard Linklater truly did something special and unique in filming this over 12 years. Watching Ellar Coltrane and Lorelei Linklater grow up over the 165 minute run time is a reminder of just how fast kids change, as trite as that sounds, and the film is quite touching. I don't think any of the vignettes we see hit a home run, but taken together as a whole the film does, in part because of its deep sense of authenticity. Linklater is masterful in his restraint, not turning this into a montage of big milestones or a melodrama, even though there are painful moments. Just one example of that is when the family moves when the kids are still young, and the last we see of a friend is a brief glimpse of him biking as the car drives off. It was natural to reflect on my own life and the lives of others while watching it, and the film seemed to showing me truths about life when viewed this way. What a lovely final scene too."
" Tour de force
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,8,"This film was a long time in the making and it is a long thing to watch, yet it completely pays off. We follow the actors across twelve years as they age from young children to young adults and all of their life experiences along the way. It is very impressive and very immersive as we really feel like we get to know these characters. It had a naturalistic feeling, like we were watching a real person's life. Although there is no overall plot to tie it together, it has overall themes that recur in every scene which have to be felt and not explained. My only complaints are that the ending dragged on a bit and the scene with the Mexican man was so cheesy it made me laugh out loud."
" A bit long but great concept
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,6,"Such an unusual concept, to use the same actors over several years and portray them changing. I enjoyed it on that basis but - if I'm honest - I found the film far too long and, in parts, I fast-forwarded it just to get through the 3 hours. As an exercise in innovative film-making it is to be commended but it couldn't hold my attention and interest as well as I'd hoped."
" 1 star is way too much
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,1,"I wish I could give the movie credit for taking 12 years to be shot but apparently they relied on that fact alone to carry the whole movie. That was it. There is no plot. There is no story. The main character is sooooo boring to watch. This felt more like a documentary but with no purpose. Like ""Oh, look, we'll just take this kid and we'll film his life for the next 12 years and then put it in a movie"" but then nothing actually happens to that guy. He goes to school, gets a girlfriend, breaks up with her, he has a mom and a dad, then a couple step dads, and then he graduates HS and goes off to college. End of the movie. That's it you people!!!! Who in their right mind thought that this storyline would make for a good movie?! Lots of movies feature the main character over long periods of time - 10, 20, 40 years sometime. That can't be your whole plot. Hello?? I mean, if the acting was amazing I could maybe watch it but nope.Speaking of acting, what I hated the most about this movie was just the absolute lame acting of the Mason guy. He's just sooooo not worthy of any screen time. The emo thing is NOT interesting. Slow talking and moving is cool in a yoga class. Not on the screen.Basically, this was just a bunch of totally random scenes depicting a totally average and boring human experience and put together in a 3 hour movie for aliens to watch and educate themselves about the most boring human experience of the most average Americans ever.Ugh. I'm sorry. I want my 3 hours back!!!"
" It Happened Here
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,9,"Watching this wonderfully simply conceived slice of life recalls watching the British 'Up' series of documentaries that commenced in 1964 or Jean-Pierre Leaud growing older but not wiser as Antoine Doinel. It's ironic that early on 'Boyhood' should reference the first 'Harry Potter' film, since it's sequels were hurt by the actors outgrowing their parts too rapidly, while that was always part of director Richard Linklater's plan from the outset.Few are aware that when Linklater began shooting this so far unique endeavour in 2001, David Carradine had for nearly fifteen years already been making his life of Mata Hari (originally due to star Barbara Hershey but eventually embarked upon in 1977 with his then 15 year-old daughter Calista in the lead), still included on the IMDb as a project in progress!"
" INTERESTING CONCEPT.
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,"Interesting concept as it was filmed over 12 years. A lot of it is instantly relatable. The movie works not by showing us something new, but by showing something that most of us have in common. The movie is also interesting as it shows the evolution of the culture between 2002 and 2013."

" An incomplete tour of unstable adolescent of an ordinary American boy
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,6,"BOYHOOD (2014) :
Brief Review -An incomplete tour of unstable adolescent of an ordinary American boy. When i came to know that Boyhood was a filmed in 'real time' for 12 years, i was impressed and shocked. I started expecting very matured and intellectual stuff already but now i can say that actually the film couldn't surpass or even came close to those expectations. Looking at the title i really thought Boyhood is just about the boy but it is not and may be too much focuse on his family members somewhere spoiled the essence of the film. In 160 minutes the boy should have had the longest screentime but he hardly had just little more than the other characters. It's more a story of an unstable family which the boy is part of rather than just the boy therefore i guess the title should have been different. The makers begun shooting this life tour of Mason (from early childhood to his arrival at college) without a complete script and that's where everything went wrong. Despite 12 years long journey it still feels an incomplete film because it doesn't have complete ending, neither it shows any outscome even after so many odds and unstable theories. I didn't like the script at all but somehow the narrative was engaging and watchable because of storytelling by the director and performances of all the actors. Boyhood is fantastic but only if you belong to such unstable and immoral American culture where not a single character is committee to any thing in life, doesn't have any aim or Focus to look at the life in positive way and doesn't learn from mistakes. For rest of the audience it is just another good film which can be watched once and can be kicked out from memory quickly. Well, i belong to the latter category as i expect something intelligent from a film rather than typical family drama and useless ruined lives. Overall, a decent one and strictly good film with several conditions.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest"
" Overhyped!!
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,5,Waited to see this film for years thinking it was going to be something special and it was totally unoriginal and uninspiring. The acting was good but that was about the only thing I liked about this film. Wondering why it got so much attention
" ""The moment seizes us""
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,10,"The growth stage, passing through childhood and adolescence, is a stage of discovery. A stage where emotions are lived in a very powerful and intimate way and where moments are as devastating as they are joyful.
In this same way 'Boyhood' is lived. And I say 'live' instead of 'see' because it is more than being a movie, it is an experience. It is a means of transport to that difficult stage of growth that we have all experienced once, although all in a different way. Precisely in this last one is where the magic of that stage and this film resides. Even though we all experience it differently or experience the film differently, each person can have an instant connection to it. 'Boyhood' is the stage of growth envisioned in a way that only cinema could achieve and only Richard Linklater could have performed with such a level of mastery and emotionality, managing to touch the soul and heart of each viewer. That is why this film is a mirror for those who experience it. A mirror that through the life of a boy and his family, any life can be represented, both yours and mine and everyone's.
The best way to appreciate this film is to let it seizes you, letting the moment seizes you."
" No

",2020-07-25 00:00:00,1,"This movie was recommended to me after watching the masterpiece that is ""Moonlight"". Was not worth it. Boring, just giving a little props for telling a realistic story but nothing remarkable happens. Bad choices were made, boo hoo. Everyone makes those in a while.

" A modern classic
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,8,"""Boyhood"" is one of the best and most unique coming-of-age movies ever made. The concept of having the same actors over 12 years is brilliant and the characters are amazing. The plot is very simple but also very powerful and the acting, especially Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette is perfect. What I love about this film is that there are hilarious moments and it is not overdramatic like these types of movies are a lot of times. Especially since I grew up in the same generation as the main character, I can relate a lot! But even if you didn't grow up in the 2000s, this is a relatable movie. There is a character for everyone in this story.
A must-see."
" Overrated

Nice movie but lacks a lot of things to become very good.
A mediocre Linklater."
" Nothing happens

There is no journey, there are no lessons learned, there is no character development.The movie doesn't make you feel anything but frustration because it's almost 3 hours long.I'm sorry to say but this one is a completely wasted opportunity."

" The Moment Seizes Us
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,9,"This was a movie following the lives of average people. The boy & the mom were definitely The center of the story. The boy grows up in a low income family & goes through moments of both hardship & levity as develops from a child to a young adult. And the Mom struggled to raise her children as she made both right & wrong life decisions. I related much to the boy as I had a similar childhood as well, from divorced parents to living as a low class family. As a kid you never realize how hard your parents work to make your life as comfortable as possible. The dad was always there to have fun & be there as a friend & father to his kids & never abandoned them no matter where they were. And the Mom went back to college to earn a degree & get a good job so she can support the family.The best line in the film was the Mom's final line: ""I thought there'd be more."" It's heartbreaking, but that's the truth about life. Life is a regular event. We spend so many years living just to die. Another reason why this line was so good because it's paired with two other moments that tie together the meaning of the film. Before the line, Mason asks his father what the point was on living, & his father responded that we were all just winging it. And in the final scene the dance teacher says ""the moment seizes you."" You watch this 3 hour film that documents regular events of life for 12 years through the eyes of a child. And in the end this child questions what ""why"" and answer is ""that's just how it is.""This was a great movie to watch at least once. The pacing isn't too bad and story was relatable. The adults of this movie always gave solid performances. There were a handful of years where the kids just didn't seem into it & weren't really good at acting, sometimes it was awkward & stale, but that was probably to be expected since they spent their entire childhood filming & got tired of it after a while. But overall they didn't do too bad. The music was also good & paired with the story nicely. And there were a few moments, especially in the end, that got me choked up. Those little moments just ""seized"" me I guess."
" Everyone should watched this from the moment they are born
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,9,I wished I had watched it earlier so I could learn from all the conflicts in the film
" Boyhood
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,8,"Simple and calm, to feel the passage of time. Only when we review the whole story can we find the wonderful and wonderful, just like the magic of time itself. It's like characters grow up in less than three hours without special effects or makeup. All of these are wonderful, like the original idea of the film, to compress time and retain the traces of time, so as to feel the wonder of life. When the boy starts again, it's not the end, it's a new beginning"
" A unique film of its kind.
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,8,"A unique film of its kind. A film that thanks to its 12 years of filming remains in the history of cinema. The main actors grow up, the film follows the protagonist over time until he goes to university and becomes an adult."
" Always present
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,9,"When we were young, we could pay attention to everything around us, family, friends, life
When I grow up, I have more things to deal with, and I gradually mature.
The teenager is going to grow up, all around him is full of changes, all traces of growth, the sky around me is changing, and the person you love has his own life.Think about the way forward, but what is life in the end?
Are we always pursuing a dream or a casual talk?
Blindly want a state, blindly want to be a person, but neglect the process, the life, the struggle
The beautiful youth years are also lost by us inadvertently
Many years later I remembered everything before
Sadness, silence, crying, and calmness
Life still has to continue
In the memory, there was the young man holding his mother's hand
Don't worry about growingOne day I suddenly realized that I really grew up, my mother is old, my father has his own life, my sister is no longer with me, everything is different, and I am not a child anymoreBut everyone will grow up
Facing this world
Become someone who doesn't want to beThat teenager is not like a teenager
Lost and lost
What should I do in the future?When we really realize the next stage of life, everything in the past is old, and we are really uncomfortable when we go all over the world and rush to the pastMaybe all we have done is to go back to the past, back to the previous feeling, a family, no one left, in the innocent era, warmth and love, enjoy the best belonging to the best timesAll the past events have become a story
Are all lonely children
Can't stop the years
Hope hello
Will we still go together in the future?
Hope it will always be the moment"
" How many times do we see ourselves in those three hours?
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,"The process of watching the movie was very easy, and it didn't feel like 160 minutes was long. After a long period of time, the trivial fragments in my life accumulated into boyhood, which lasted for 12 years.Two years in a three-hour movie and it's kind of brutal when it comes out. How many times do we see ourselves in those three hours?"
" People get bored and don't understand the way Linklater changed history
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,10,"I watched it with my friends, which wasn't a good idea. Most of them fell asleep and found it boring, the reason is it is the most real and moving movie I have ever seen. Since it follows this Mason Jr's live until he graduates with the same actors of a 12 year timeline, it doesn't seem forced or fake. It is the best indication that even though movies take people out of real life, they can make people think of real life as well, which many movies haven't done that to me the extent that Boyhood has done.Also I would advise to watch alone unless you are watching with a movie buff because a lot of people can ruin the experience of this masterpiece"
" An american story, a story about life
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,8,"When i saw the movie length i discouraged a bit, but actually despite nothing particularly extraordinary happens, the movie flew along easily.
Maybe because it's a film about a part of life i've already lived, maybe because it's extraordinarily simple in the best meaning of the word.It's a very natural movie and natural it's the way it' acted, brilliantly.Moving in some parts, very well shot, beautiful photography, a very brilliant and true film about life."
" Those summers, just like youth, can't come back.
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,9,"In fact, this is not a movie, basically is an American TV series, because this film is not on the art of film or the edge of the film art, is the United States of Texas middle class trivial, dog blood life, the performance is almost as exaggerated as the American TV series. However, it's important to this, however, 6 years old to 18 years old, 12 years of time, no film could be so, but Lin guide dare under the hand, and the time to pile up, see there can be no last viewers don't ""self-injury origin"", beside me someone smile, someone sighing, someone to rub your eyes silently bowed head, I know this is director in the emotional, but was left so comfortable, in fact, to the end, really all faults can be forgiven."
" Filmmaking passion at it's best, but nothing more.
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,3,"This movie is a technical achievement. It took many years to film this film. We can see the characters age, we can see the popular culture of the time in the background. Sadly that's about it. The story is very poor, it is the life, the ""boyhood"" of a boy, it shows how he grows, what happens in his life. He lives a very average life, so nothing is interesting or anything memorable is shown."
" It was good.
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,8,"For some people could be boring as it is a movie of 2h for really no action happening. For me it was really good, not like it changed my life too. It was somehow nostalgic and in some ways I could relate and understand what was going on.
To be honest, I though it would be different, and with more drama in some parts , but then prettu intense in others."
" Embrace the passage of time
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"The movie can be summarized in one sentence: ""The life of an ordinary Texas boy 6 to 18 years old."" But I always think that the protagonist in Linklater's lens is time. We can see the marks of time everywhere in the movie. And the editor connected the materials seamlessly, making people feel that time was slipping away from their fingers inadvertently."
" This movie comes once in life.
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,8,We always watch actors growing up in a movie but with different actors this time it's the same actors.
" Current Youth
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,7,"Notwithstanding the fact that I don't agree with the use of actors younger than 16 in sex conversations, this movie is a real and authentic portrait of nowadays children and adolescents and the way their parents deal with them. This is the particular story of a young boy from childhood to adolescence with all the problems of his relationship with adults namely with his divorced mother and his estranged father. The movie runs smoothly and pleasant to watch through all the scenes regarding these views."
" Everyone has one movie that made them fall in love with cinema, for me that movie is Boyhood.
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,10,"When I first saw Boyhood, I knew right away I had seen something special. Watching it was truly unforgettable. I remember the place, the time and the feeling after my first viewing. It is a movie that I come back to time after time and each time I'm left with a strong feeling nostalgia, calm and wonder. It spoke to and connected me to cinema, I was truly able comprehend the magic of cinema, how a person can fall in love with movies.The premise for Boyhood is simple: what does it mean to grow up, become an adult, and live? It's a coming of age story of boy shot over the course of 12 years, each year Richard Linklater reunited the same cast and shot segments of the film. At 165 minutes, this dramatic epic had me just yearning for more. I wanted to see their journeys continue, and just relish in this dream a bit longer. Linklaters's ability to capture people, their experience and a life and render it into film is magical. The dialogs are touching and feel natural. The soundtrack soars and carries you off in a perfect state of sadness and joy.Ellar Coltrane is simply stupendous. As you watch his transformation before your eyes, scene after scene, year after year, it's impressive how Coltrane interprets Mason understanding his confusions, realizing his flaws. Lorelei Linklater is every bit as brilliant as any person in the cast, she is annoying, awkward and sweet and you fall in love with her transformation from girl to woman. Ethan Hawke showcases an eager willingness to connect with his children, it is a sensational and compelling look into fatherhood and being human. Patricia Arquette is the emotional center of the film with her beautiful and captivating performance as a mother desperately trying to live the life she dreamed of whilst making a life for her children. When she says ""I thought there would be more"" you instantly think about your own family life and its constant flux. This film spans from bedtime stories to packing for college. It encompasses how the parent-child relationship changes and matures with life and aging.The film is about milestones in life including phases of inevitable ugliness, aspirations for the future, mistakes of the past, uncertainty of the present and much more. It really just shows how little moments in our lives when were growing up really make up who we are. It made me realize that one day we will look back and inevitably ask ourselves: where on earth did the time go?"

" It is life.
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,10,"I've watched this movie 2 times, in 2014 and 3 days ago. I still feel the same for this movie. Sometimes things just happen the way we don't expect and some people, they're just gone without a chance to say goodbye. Sometimes, adults talk adult things that's hard to understand but the more we know as we grow up."
" Decisions we choose to make! Life!
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,8,"The crazy thing about this movie is its shooting time ~ 12 years. The story of a child from his childhood to the college. His parents get divorced. Both of them movie there separate ways, but the father has privilege to meet his children. How his mom, makes certain bad decisions about partners, banking and life. But still on good terms with the father of the children. It focusses more on life of Mason to college. This movie grows along with Mason. It raises a question on life partners and unwise decisions we make?. We grow up but we still make bad decisions, thats what makes us human. The ending quote is the best thing of the movie. Rest of movie is good."
" Memories and stories of life
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,8,"Looking at the 12 years of shooting, once everything is added to the brewing of time, it will start to smell. Like Seven, who has heard the name but has not yet begun to appreciate it, it is worth boasting that it can persist for 49 years. The parents of 12 years are short, have unsuccessful marriages, and have rebellions that are not extreme conflicts. Maybe this is life. Watching the movie, suddenly there are some fragments of the once life, the dreams or wishes of the past. Face bravely now."
" Interesting.
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,9,"I loved this movie. I really really really loved this movie, and watch it at least three or four times a year.Great story. Great performances. Amazing character development. Very entertaining."
" respectable
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,7,"I can respect what the movie is and stands for. the movie seems a little unsure of its direction, but in my opinion the story does have an arc. you can give a lot of credit for its production and affort that went into the representation of the timeline, but to me that is not the most important thing when it comes to movies that i like. still this is on of the better movies when it comes to movies that arent really for me.7/10: actually pretty pog"
" Richard Linklater deserved the Oscar
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,9,Great movie worth the hype and the 12 year wait. Richard Linklater deserved the Oscar
" Impressive on its technical merits alone.
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,9,"Impressive on its technical merits alone (it took more than a decade filming with the same actors), this literal coming-of-age film can be cliche and stereotypical at times, but that's what lends it the unique, and generic, childhood that most anyone can associate with. Don't let the 3-hour runtime scare you away: a lot of moments compose the process of growing up."
" long drawn out film
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,5,"Very disappointed in this movie,so long,boring at times and I am totally amazed Patricia Arquette got an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as I think it was her worst movie ,"
" Life through a lens
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Film-makers trying to tell a story set over a long period of time suffer from the problem that their casts don't age at the same rate as their characters. Makeup (and latterly CGI) can go some way to correcting this, but when the characters are children, there's often little choice but to cast different actors. For his film 'Boyhood' director Richard Linklater took a different approach: film in pieces for more than a decade. The result is a film that feels very intimiate: I have no idea whether Linklater was guided in his script by his cast's real lives, but at any rate, we see them turning from children to adults and it's feels moving and close. The actual script is very gentle, centred on the sensitive (but not too unusual) Mason; the subtext is the reality of the struggles of parenthood. I don't always like Linklater, but I think he's at his best when, like in this film, he doesn't appear to be trying too hard; it's a lengthy movie where in some senses not much happens, but it never drags, perhaps because what does happen is simultaneously so ordinary and amazing."
" Bad
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,4,Very boring movie about nothing. Good Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette... and thats ALL.
" Nothing major happens, but still kept me watching
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,8,"Not many films can do this, but this did. It kept me watching although nothing major seems to happen. I put this down to Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette's acting. Hawke was entertaining, funny, real and overall convincing as his part.I do feel more could have been done to create drama BUT this is not an action film, not a horror, or thriller. I am assuming it's meant to take us through the journey of a boy growing in to a young man - and sometimes life isn't full of action and thrills, explosions and huge drama. I appreciated that they tried to make this as real as they could.Of course, there were parts with some drama though like the abusive step father and the control freak ex military step father.Overall I enjoyed the movie, did not feel like it dragged at all."
" Literally a Waste of Time
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,1,"I can easily watch my nieces or neighbours growing up, what's the point of watching some people growing old? The only thing in that movie is shooting during 12 years, I feel sorry for that waste, it could have some plot or any action, no one took that risk before but it was not necessary!!! And I hate Maeson's hair, oh and I watched half of the movie then I skipped the scenes and I deleted it after I saw nothing changed, I wish if there rating under zero value to rate that movie"
" I don't give out 10/10s like nothing but
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,10,"This movie is deserving of it. The plot is not as in depth or thought provoking and it's not one of those films that will BLOW YOU AWAY... but that's EXACTLY why it does anyways... the movie has such a simple premise and plot that it works it's way with it in such UNIQUE AND COMPELLING WAYS. The script is amazing, the acting is amazing, the story is amazing everything about this movie works. I feel as if I was there living through this life with mason it's crazy. I loved BOYHOOD masterpiece and will be talked about many years to come."
" Pretty good
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,9,"Pretty good movie! Very impressive, and it's deep bro."
" Sick of Hollywood Politicizing!!!
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,2,"I don't want my dentist, my boss or my hair stylist ranting on about their political views... and I am totally SICK of Hollyweird's soap box. When Ethan Hawke attacked the President within a few moments into the film, it turned me off so I turned it off. Get over it already... the McCarthy Era (which, was questionable anyway) was over 70 years ago... you weren't even alive!!!"
" in my humble opinion
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,10,In my opinion this is the greatest film ever made.
" 12 years worth it
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,10,"I think this is just one of the few perfect films ever made. Boyhood is also one of my favourite films right now, everything in this movie is so well done.Patricia Arquette, Ellar Coltrane, and Ethan Hawke are just perfect and watching Ellar grew up is amazing. When i heard that this movie took 12 years in the making the first thing i thought was: bullshjt. The script is so natural and incredible written. Patricia basically stole the movie because she deserved that Oscar. The characters are very well developed and don't be fooled by the runtime, yes it's almost 3 house long but is worth every freaking minute.This movie made me rethink everything, it leaves you thinking over and over, i'm sad that i couldn't watch this on the big screen. This is the last film I saw in 2019 and i'm glad it was this one.Happy new year to everyone."
" Just so god damn boring!
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,4,"I cannot understand how someone can rate this movie with 10 stars. ratings seem just so out of place these days. If someone likes a movie, it gets 10 stars. If someone dislikes a movie, it gets 1 star. Where's the point here? Same applies to this movie. Unfortunately, lots of people out there like to get bored to death!Yes, it´s a great idea shooting a movie over a couple of years to illustrate how a boy grows up and becomes a young man, but that´s all the greatness you will encounter while watching this never ending story. There's not much happening. Actually, there's nothing happening at all. Most characters feel flat and two-dimensional as there is no character development. Honestly, I did not feel any emotion while watching this movie, just the relief when it ended. However, there are far worse movies out there, so 4 stars for this one seems legit."
" Boyhood organically condenses twelve years of upbringing into an undramatic three hour behemoth.
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,6,"The journey of adolescence is one personality-altering experience that each of us inevitably undertakes. An existential life step that physically and personably transforms our very bodies, from innocent child to independent adult. Parents forced to release their protective talons and enable their children to venture out into the harsh world, justifiably falling down the pitfalls of life and picking themselves back up again. But what's the point of it all? We grow up. We attend school. We work. We live, love and lie. Only to see ourselves never progress on a personal level. Life is valuable. It is a finite amount of time that rapidly ticks by at the rate to which we grow older. It can often be disillusioning, but most importantly, it can be special. It's up to us to make the most out of the limited time bestowed upon us.Linklater's sprawling coming-of-age epic is a technical masterclass in ingenuity. Depicting the adolescence of a young boy growing up in Texas with his divorced parents. Logistically, literarily and lovingly, Linklater opted for the innovative concept of filming in real-time. The actors physically growing with their characters, with the ability to add personal experiences to the narrative. This ambitious depiction of maturing is subconsciously organic, and proved to be an effective method in illustrating adolescence. It kept the casting limited, without having to obtain multiples actors for the same character at different stages of childhood, and exhumed a sense of natural intuition.That being said, this meticulous construct of film-making unfortunately facilitated a mellow story that lacked any drama or emotional depth. Coming-of-age dramas work effectively when depicting one specific year that dares to dramatically endeavour into relatability. The issue with Boyhood is that, due to its extensive duration of narrational time, several aspects were emotionally subdued. For example, Mason experimenting with alcohol and recreational substances. Linklater failed to dig into the emotional conflict that lead Mason down that path, merely likening the character to an empty shell. Another example, Bill drunkenly assaulting Olivia. Again, this case of domestic abuse is only touched upon before Linklater moves on with Mason's life.Boyhood is essentially a montage of fictitious memories. Good and bad. It's all part of growing up. But does that necessarily result in an entertaining or emotionally captivating film? For me, it's a hesitant ""no"". Sure, there will be scenes that are relatable to your own upbringing and therefore engage you momentarily. Personally I warmed to the scenes involving Hawke's fatherly figure and his attempt to rekindle with his children. Growing up with divorced parents, Linklater's dialogue was incredibly realistic and related to my own life. But as I said, he then quickly moves on with the narrative and the emotionality is diminished yet again. Hawke and Arquette offer their intense acting styles to spice up the narrative, however Coltrane and Linklater's own daughter rarely displayed variety. The plot's structure itself commenced with nostalgic-fuelled simplicity (GameBoy Advance SP, DragonBall Z, Coldplay's ""Yellow"" etc.) and then ending on philosophical existentialism, which I suppose merged adequately with Mason's advancing frame of mind.Yet I cannot shake the feeling of disappointment. Linklater took no risks with the story. Limited emotional depth. Boyhood, for all its technical ingenuity, remained hollow. ""One of the greatest films of the decade""? I'm not convinced, yet I appreciate the innovation behind the lacklustre story."
" The moment is always right now.
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,8,"After finishing Boyhood and slowly gathering my thoughts on it I did what I usually do, fly over to Letterboxd to jot those thoughts down before they escape me. What I wasn't prepared for was what happened when I saw that poster. It was a slap in the face, a jarring reminder that I had just spent twelve years with someone.I think it's easy to not look beyond this film's ambitious conception and even write it off as a non-eventful gimmick. There is no real plot, there are no grand character arcs, no dramatic tension. It lacks a narrative flow and has more scope than focus, it ambles on throughout its running time, meandering along the trivial and occasionally touching upon more serious matters, if only to skip on to the next minor life event most of us have experienced one way or another. If you'd regard these things as criticisms, you'd be right, Boyhood was probably not for you.It was for me though. Ever so much.Linklater's stunning film blurs the lines of art and life completely. In doing so, he brilliantly chooses an approach lacking of any pretense, opting for emulation instead of manipulation. I am convinced that many viewers, myself included, have this preconceived notion of how a dramatic film should play out and how it should be acted. Linklater wipes that preconception off the table with a project that is truer than anything I've ever seen. The acting is understated throughout which only adds to the realization of the ambition of the project. There are no frills, just life. Plain, ordinary life. And I did not expect it to pack such a punch.As a parent, witnessing a child's shaping of a past for an unknown future was a truly gripping experience. I felt constantly involved. It reminded me both of my youth and of my struggles and fears as a parent. Life isn't about the big moments alone, it's predominantly about the small moments, the fleeting moments that you'd want to hold on to forever in retrospect or regret experiencing or causing. Young Mason not knowing where he belongs, the constant look of regret in Ethan Hawke's eyes when he sees every missed opportunity looking at his kids, Patricia Arquette's relatable but ever so painful final monologue, that kiss, that camping trip, the Black Album, the shared fear for the drunk parent, that first beer, getting advice from your old man about your love life and leaving your parents behind to build a life of your own; Boyhood treats all those moments with a disarming tenderness, truthfulness and with the greatest of respect.This unique singularity in the world of cinema made me miss my dad, who died when I was six, ever so much, made me check on my kids to watch them sleep for a while and steered me towards some old photo albums. And looking at a younger me, playing my own version of Boyhood in my head, I fully felt the extent of Mason's last line in the film.The moment is always right now."
" Interesting but kind of pointless
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,6,Interesting story but the movie is pretty forgettable since it doesn't have a very strong impact on someone's mind. Would never watch again.
" Love it
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,10,Peaceful. Comfortable. Passionate. Empathize. Hopeful. Persistence. Touching
" It could've been a masterpiece.
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,6,"I can see the artistic aspect of the movie and each roles capture for this film. I mean it it's a great accomplishment, especially dealing with a cast for so long and particularly child actors. Other than that I guess that's about it, at least for me. Yeah you could say the fact that we are watching the life of these people pass throughout the years in a few hours it's amazing. But that aside, the story it's pretty ordinary, even boring. I cant even relate with any of the characters or circumstances brought up on this movie, and the sudden gaps make it look like an incomplete film, so its even worst for me as a viewer, since I cant get into the story. Ill say its just like watching one of those 10 year challenge facebook videos or sliding through someone social media nowadays. Which say a lot about all this project.
In the end I do recommend at least giving it a try and getting your own conclusions."
" Overrated and boring
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,2,I went to see this because it has 1000 on Metacritic so I was excited.I stopped watching after the 5th existential angst monologue.
" Over rated
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,5,I like the experience. Its very different. But i dont like the story or anyother part of this movie. Starting was good and after few minutes it lost its beauty.
" Boring
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,3,"Too boring, I even didn't finish it and whatch to the end"
" It's life and it's pointless. That's the point.
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,9,"I get why this film isn't for everyone, but personally, I was exactly the gloomy 'boring' kid Mason portrays, and maybe that's why it worked so well. This film does a great job at showing life as it passes by, and I particularly love how the parents are included with their own struggles. I was left pondering life a lot, and that's an achievement. There are enough movies with exciting concrete plots, but not every movie benefits from it. The realism of the mundane in Boyhood is what makes it work. It's very relatable, and rarely feels scripted at all."
" BORING AND EMPTY OF EVERYTHING
",2019-10-09 00:00:00,1,"This was literally the most boring movie I have ever seen in 49 years, in fact absolutely everything related to this movie was boring... including the acting.This is also my first movie review in the same amount of time as I felt I really had to warn you not to watch this."
" My life is a 100x more interesting than this
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,1,"I can't believe this movie was made and presented, I had to turn it off, how could it be about nothing at all, and follow the most boring lives of the most boring people ever."
" Very disappointed.
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,4,"This is well directed, edited, acting etc, but the trial and tribulations of young boy/man.
The movie spends most its time centered on Mason, in his growing up = and the fears and anxiety we ALL have gone thru as children into adolescence.
It brough NOTHING new.
Mason continues to be self-absorbed through out the movie, in search for the meaning of self.
It just lacks true dynamic change in his character. Just a not very interesting gimmicky movie."
" A for effort, F for performance
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,4,"What are the chances of a child actor growing up to be a good actor? We all know the answer. Someone put all his eggs in one basket, and this basket was a regular charming seven-year-old who - like most - ended up as an awkward teenager. Great if it were a documentary. But it's not. Ellar is just smiling his way through the second half of the movie, and laughs in every line. Nothing he says is beliveable. Fun concept but doesn't work irl."
" The difficulties and realness of growing up
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,9,This film does an excellent job illustrating how difficult it can be while becoming a teenager and young adult. This film will always hold a special place in my heart because it is very relatable in many aspects of life.
" An epic in probably every sense of the word
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,9,"Shot over 12 years, this 2 hour 45 minute film manages too fly by, by the ending I wanted to see a little more, because the boy's journey to a man is fascinating and enthralling. But what makes this movie really special are it's themes of lost fathers, growing physically and metaphorically and the point of life itself. There also the little things, like Mason's hair changing with each transition. Overall, defiantly worth the watch because no other film has pulled off a feat like this."
" Nostalgic and captivating
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,9,"I felt as if I was re experiencing my childhood watching this film. Divorce, Lost in video games as means to escape, before the internet, being outside, getting in trouble, not fitting in, even the haircut scene really hit home for me. I really enjoyed it and wells of emotion kept me engaged for the movies entirety. I wasnt sold on the acting on Patricias parts at times and over all kept me from giving the film a 10. A must watch for anyone looking for a emotional, sentimental, life story. Has me reevaluating my own life which I must say only good movies would do."
" A human story
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,10,"This movie does an incredible job of keeping the characters relatable and not feeling fake. There are a couple of cliches such as drunk ex husbands, and the emo son. But overall the story is simple and the film is beautiful"
" Meh.
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,5,"One note gimmick. Otherwise a fairly awful movie. Kids are mediocre to bad actors. Many supporting actors also pretty flat, or even inconsistent.And mostly, structured in a way that bugs me to no end but is popular these days. Like a typical biopic, it's just a series of disconnected vignettes, with no clear through-line to me.Regardless of the overall message: boring. Clunky as well. Specific videogames, TV news cutaways to I guess set the timeframe. Tries to use music to set mood here and there, but it feels very out of place as the rest of the film is naturalistic, or has all diegetic sound, and music.All in all, what I might expect from an experimental hobby project."
" Overrated...
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,7,"""Boyhood"" is a famous 2014 film. Famous because it took 12 years to make, and tells it's story of a boy growing up in real time. And it sounds interesting. I mean, 12 years, that has to be good. Well, if you ask me, it isn't.Now, I know a lot of people like this movie. But that doesn't mean I have to. My problems lay mostly with the acting and the runtime. In the next few paragraphs I will list the problems and explain them all.1.) Lack of realism. ""Boyhood"" is a movie that tries to be very realistic in it's portrayal of the struggles of growing and being a kid. But for a movie so adimate on realism, this film doesn't know how kids talk or act.A good example of this are most of the scenes with the kid characters. It's clear that the writers don't know how kids talk and act around each other. Now, when they are around the adult characters, they're fine. But when interacting without them, it's cringe worthy. Like a scene with the kids in elementary school, where the girls gossip about lesbians, and boys argue about Star Wars, repeatively saying ""Yoda"". As a teenage boy, who to be that young, I can tell you, I never talked like that. But there's an even worse scene, where the kids are teenagers hanging out. The kids talk about sex and describe rape asking if they had ""a piece of ass"". And at that, the acting terrible, and such phrases as ""true dat"" are used. And it's I couldn't believe how bad the scenes was. ""This has a 100% on Metacritic?"" I asked myself.2.) There's no conflict. If this film was 90 minutes, I would give it a pass. But it's almost 3 hours. And you feel every minute of it. And what makes it worse is the complete lack of conflict.There's no overarching narrative, and it's just boring. The main character is just a normal kid, and he's so boring. The film feels like it has ADHD, it can't stay on one plot. First you have the abusive step-father, then not even an hour in, they leave him, and he's never seen again. Then unrelated events occur, and the movie just stops. And many may claim the movie's about the mondain things of life, but any interesting movie would focus on interesting things.3.) It's forgettable. Okay, this movie took twelve years to make, do you remember anything else about the film? I really don't, I watched it not to long ago, and I'm starting to forget it. It's just boring and overly long, and people only remember it because it took so long to make. That's it's one gimick. And even though there are films like the ""Up Series"" (a much better film), a series documentaries about the lives of a group of British kids. And shows like ""Roseanne"" where the people get older, both much better and more memorable products. So the idea isn't even as original as you might think.What I like: Okay, I actually did things in this movie. First off, the father played by Ethan Hawke is well written and memorable. Feeling like a normal father, a father that likes to spend time with his kids. And the movie is also shot very well. And the mother is also decent. But these praises don't make up for the flaws.I can kind of understand why people like this. It's acted well (at least the adult actors), and is shot very well, but does that really make up for bad writing and an overly long runtime? My answer is no."
" Phenomenal, though falls short of its unbelievable potential
",2019-07-08 00:00:00,8,"A staggering and successful attempt at capturing the early years of boys. A movie spanning over 12 years in the production will always be something special, and there is no question that Richard Linklater has made a groundbreaking film in this genre.Boyhood follows the boy Mason from his early kindergarten days to his first steps into adulthood. Throughout the years we follow Mason, his mother goes through several breakups and divorces. Something that is bound to have an effect on children. Mason's biological father, whom Mason's mother had departed with before the movie's start, comes to visit every other weekend and takes Mason and his sister Samantha out on different events. From the beginning it is obvious that Mason's father has some clear parenting issues and one might perhaps understand why Mason's mother left him. At the same time Mason's new stepdads seem much nicer at first. Though all this change later when they all turn out to be drunken control freaks.It truly makes a great point about our life and society, when towards the ending of the movie, Mason's mother and father's lives have taken very different turns. His father, learning from the mistake he did with Mason's mother, develops through bonding with his children a sense of parenting and manages to gain some control over his life, while also finding a partner to stick with. Mason's mother on the other hand, keeps trying to find a good man, and all of them turns out to be horrendous. Towards the end his mother is exhausted, feeling that her life has been a complete waste of time. This greatly illustrates the harsh environment women sometimes find themselves in and how men more often than not can be idiots. Mason's father can simply learn from his mistakes and start again with another woman, while Mason's mother has to go through it all again with another man.All of this is deeply and profoundly made with a lot of thought. Though where the movie falls short for me is the story of our main character. As any young human being, Mason goes through various stages of his life. Having long hair, being emo, painted nails and earrings. Something that all parents must be above all things is supportive. None of Mason's stepfathers were that. Having his hair shaven off at the barber and complaining about his earrings and painted nails. Though we see later how this will shape older Mason, I feel the movie fails at showing his momentary emotions. Not once throughout the film do we see Mason actually cry, and I do not for a second believe a person goes through their teens without shedding a tear. It feels like a missed opportunity. While the movie is exceptionally well made, it feels like it focuses more on the events circulating Mason rather than the effects it has on him. I would not have minded this film being 4 hours long, as it was joyful to watch all the way through, just so we could have been showed more sides of Mason.On the technical aspects of the movie, it excels even further. The acting is truly remarkable, with the best performance coming from Ellar Coltrane (Mason), that I believe was Oscar worthy. Furthermore, Linklater knows how to get what he wants from the actors in every scene. Because they all seem supernaturally realistic, without being dull. On this aspect the script and dialog must be noted as well. While not being the most eventful like a Tarantino or Coen movie, this movie's dialog is so brilliant just for the fact that it is not. It absolutely nails conversations between teenagers, as well as adults and between adults and teenagers as well. Needles to say, the cinematography, production design and the rest is spot on, and the movie also needs to be hailed for it's unprecedented achievement in having the same actors do the same movie for 12 years. Have that in any movie and its bound to be good. The only part I feel the movie dissatisfies in, in the technical aspect, was that the scenes often felt too short, like there was no time to grasp the events that just unfolded. Finishing the movie it is hard to pick a ""favourite scene"" as there barely were any long enough to consider.Conclusively, this movie is nothing short of brilliant. Though in some ways a let down, not because of what it was, but because of what it could have been. It truly could have been the perfect movie."
" Waste of time
",2019-06-19 00:00:00,1,"This was just a waste of time really, boring people living their boring life LITTERALLY and I'm not even exaggerating. If you watch this movie you will regret and think to yourself ""Damn, I should listen to this random guy's review"". Other guys reviewing this movie 1 star and ranting about the story are ALL RIGHT."
" Very slow with mediocre acting.
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,5,"Didn't resonate with me. I frankly regret watching this film, because fair or not, it actually makes me like Linklater's other work less - even Waking Life, which for years was my favorite movie. I think the main problem I had with the film was a perceived lack of conflict. The guy had a couple of stepdads who were jerks. But other than that, his boyhood went pretty smoothly - almost in an idyllic manner. I would have liked to see more struggles - say, with depression, unpopularity, etc. It would have made the film more compelling."
" was ok, but too long. nothing special besides the way it was filmed.
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,6,"So, of course the concept sounds very interesting at the beginning, but then you realise you have seen this many times in series that last years and you saw actors grow old along the show. Same thing, only this one is a movie.
But that was the bad thing about it for me, the movie felt like a recap or resume of a long series, where you see the main events without getting any detail or getting to connect with the characters feelings, because from one moment to another, years go by and what happened just moments ago now it just don't matter.
So I never got to connect with the character. I don't know if it's the actor's fault or just the writing of his character, but I thought he was quite inexpressive and boring as a person.
I spent the almost three hours waiting for him to blow up or react to something but he never did, he just goes by with everything, unhappy but doing nothing about it.
The movie is called ""Boyhood"" but it's really about time passing, for everyone. Could be called ""Life"" or something like that. Mason doesn't feel like the main character really, in my opinion, we spend a lot of time with other characters too, which are as important as him. More on the first half of the movie, then in the second part or after it starts focusing more on him.
Anyway, the movie felt long, definitely, but it was OK to watch, not as good as I expected though."
" Powerful Film
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,7,Perhaps one of the most powerful movies the history of film. What sets this above all others is its ability to transcend the screen and bring the viewer into the life of mason.There is something for everyone in this movie.
" A very unique film
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,7,"From 2002-2013, this film tells the trials and joys of a Texas family. At the beginning, Mason (7 years old) and Samantha (9 years old) live with their single mother while having occasional visits from their father. In the years that follow, there is a lot of moving, education choices, new relationships, and growing up.This film is rightly praised for its very unique approach. It was filmed in sequences once a year for each year of the story. The same actors were used so we could see the effects of aging, especially in the children, with no need for special make-up or role replacements with older look-alike actors. For this very unique approach, the kudos are rightly deserved.But speaking of kudos, it is well known that this is one of the most critically acclaimed movies in a long time earning almost unanimously perfect ratings. I found ""Boyhood"" to be a good film but not an excellent one. It certainly does well to maintain interest constantly during its nearly three-hour run. It also exposes the sides of life that challenge most of us especially during teen years when we are constantly being told to ""buckle up"" because ""life is tough"". During many interesting discussions, these attitudes are challenged. These conversations are very engaging.So while I don't agree with all the average rating of this film, I still give it praise for its uniqueness. There are also fine performances by Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as the divorced parents, particularly Arquette."
" 👌🏻👌🏻
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,9,"It's true: Linklater took 12 years to develop his family of characters. While I was intimidated by the 3 hour run time, I have to admit, there was not a moment of this film I could have done without."
" very good
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,6,"May not be the most fleshed out when it comes to answering the character's development, but it's contained so many resonant with me moments, that I've really needed by the way, that I can't just skip it as a significant movie that you may just watch whenever feeling lost. I watched it once, planning to watch it at least once more."
" I love this movie
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,10,"It's a fabulous idea. Filming over the period of a family growing up. It's also a fabulous film. The life of kids as they suffer the poor life decisions of their mother who goes through dysfunctional men like....I don't know what. Ironically it is the father of her kids who turned out to be the dad the kids needed. A man with heart, integrity and buckets of love and time for his kids.It's a film about poor decisions, about growing up, about boyhood. Great, unpretentious fly on the wall drama if you like this type of thing. I love this type of thing.You really feel like you're growing up with these people. Some say there's nothing happening but those who have grown up in dysfunctional families will see plenty happening in this picture. Especially the controlling mother who's drawn to weak men and whose son Mason himself grows up to be rather effeminate and weak-looking in appearance."
" Great story, but this movie is way too long
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,7,"I think the same effect could've been the same at two hours. i think this movie is pretty over rated, and the only technical achievement was that it was filmed over time, there really isnt anything mesmerizing here."
" Came in just right
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,10,"I just had some fuss with my family which made me sad, 'cause I'm currently far away from them in a kind of college, and I miss them, and then I stumbled upon this movie. As another reviewer said, ""this is life!"" It really is. It is so completely real, that at one point towards the ending I came to a quick realization that it's actually fiction, and I'm not just going down my neighbour's or my old friend's or a stranger's memory lane. But it could've been. And parts of it you identify with so much that it feels like *you* are legitimately re-living your *own* childhood/boyhood. That's what I call a masterpiece of cinema.
It did exactly what it wanted to do as I see it; lets life move around you and lets you feel time while asking all kinds of deep-felt questions, which we the audience are left to dwell on.
Thank you for this special experience. Made me feel a whole lot clearer about everything."
" Dissapointing
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,6,"It's funny. As I was getting closer to the end I thought to myself ""This reminds of the Before Sunrise/Sunset movies."" and I look it up after the fact....same writer/director.
From what I've seen Richard isn't your typical storyteller. He's more of a character study type of creator. Problem is the final cut doesn't always equal a satisfying result.The concept is outstanding. Take the same cast and keep them on board for over a decade for the same movie. Tell the story of them growing up (and make no mistake about it. This movie is much more about the kids than the adults)Problem is...there's a lot of cliche's along the way. Some ideas feel thrown in because it feels like they should be. Some ideas seem recycled. Some things just don't add up.I enjoyed it for what it is because it's still a great concept. At the end of the day though it could have been a lot more.P.S. I would have said 7, but knock a full point down for force feeding the politics in. Using them to tell the story of a character is completely fair game but this was more just creator taking an excuse to establish timeline and using it preach instead."
" I was somebody's daughter, then I was somebody's mother.
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,6,"Linklater-speak has small talk ascend and wrap around the universe, lift you into a higher consciousness and state of being...and if pure dialogue won't do it, the drugs will probably get you there. His films appear simplistic, and yet some are a puzzling contradiction. Everybody Wants Some, a packaged vignette with the style and tone of a lazy summer afternoon, was a film that Linklater could have made in his sleep. It's a story you snuggle and curl up to, bask in the nostalgia - all while he weeds out a pot-smoking Wyatt Russell, who has clearly overstayed his welcome in this era. Why even call out your guilty pleasures? Own them, don't apologise. Worse still, it was shot in pristine digital, so even the excuse of a technical upgrade for Dazed and Confused doesn't hold water.Boyhood, in its epic, decade-long documentation of an adolescent emerging, wants to tap into those same yearnings. There's nothing more nostalgic than hearing a track from your childhood. Or recalling sweaty Halo co-op matches after school. Or remembering the political fervour of Obama's presidential campaign. The film starts with a blast of Coldplay's Yellow, which I was surprised to realise was now 19 years old. Time sneaks up on you like that. But for much of this trip down memory lane, these feel less like authentic mementos and more like dated accumulations of pop culture. It's as if Linklater, in his elliptical, seamless editing, needs something universal to ground our sense of time in, and looked to the closest flashing billboard. The story may unfold like a life-sized documentary, shot in unadorned verite (no pesky, obvious captions to signal a new calendar year), but the audience markers are there all the same.So there's the other contradiction within Boyhood, with Linklater unfurling delicate vignettes that point to his skill in capturing a slice of life, but still determined to cycle through a series of defined periods. The relentlessness of this process refutes any ideas in the film's thesis of capturing 'just life'. The same time skips are the gulfs in-between his Before trilogy, but carry weight and consequence. In a masterwork like Before Sunset, the two protagonists meet cute for the second time in their lives, but far from indulging the youthful idealism of their first encounter, the pair must now reckon with their baggage of guilt and regret. They retrace their magical night in Vienna, but slight lines have emerged on their faces, and their steps are now more cautious.Mason ages before our eyes, but must follow a pre-ordained path (Linklater was always going to finish on that shot in the Big Bend, no matter the emphasis on script improvisation). That's part of the trouble in a project like this; you cast young and are locked in for the next decade. Ellar Coltrane grows physically, but there is only so much you can ascribe to a mop of hair and sunken eyes in place of acting talent (giving a teenager a camera does not make him an interesting person). Linklater's daughter is initially vivacious but reportedly became bored with the project, so her character shrinks into the background, barely wallpaper decor by film's end. Would the story's trajectory have changed if Lorelei Linklater hadn't grown restless? We'll never know. That's just life, I guess.Linklater positions the adult figures of Mason's life as shifting enigmas, sliding in and out of the centre of his universe. Some of these resemble ideological caricatures rather than genuine life lessons, as in the exhilarated earnesty of a fast-food chain manager dangling a promotion to fry cook over his head, or a dose of 'reality' delivered in a dark room by his photography teacher. Mason reacts with a surly shrug, his default position towards almost everything, which is understandable given these figures only want to package him into a smaller version of their own lives. And yet this reaction is mirrored in an almost identical fashion when Linklater wants to delve a little deeper. Olivia's third husband Jim is an alcoholic veteran, and the film stages one of his outbursts just as Mason returns home one night, way past his curfew. With tears in his eyes, he laments their lack of connection despite the fact that he has much more of a presence in their lives than Mason's blood father. But this falls on deaf ears: why should Mason care? His life is all about parties and backseat snogging with girls who we won't even see the face of. He shrugs, and so does the film.What's frustrating about this is that sometimes Boyhood gets it right, asking tough questions of fatherhood and how broken families must evolve and persevere without responding through clean, cookie-cutter answers that conventionally structured dramas tend to offer. One of these involves Mason realising that his father has traded his 1968 Pontiac GTO for the more family friendly minivan option, baffled that the man who once sported a soul-patch and roomed with a druggie could ever mature. The time skips work in favour for Hawke, whose intermittent appearances in his kid's lives say more about the pains of growing up than Mason himself ever could. In fact, a film focusing on Mason's parents would be infinitely more interesting. Imagine if the story had given actual weight to Arquette's arc, so that when she all but spits out the core theme in her penultimate Oscar monologue, it doesn't just feel like philosophical posturing. What of her own life, in how she is initially led by society to believe that kids must have father figures, must have steady families, before finally embarking on her own journey of independence? While the boy grew up, spare a thought for his parents, who scarcely had the time to plot their own paths."
" Fantastic Movie with Interesting Premise
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,9,"The fact that this movie was shot with the same cast over 12 years is fascinating. Even if you didn't know about this, the movie is still a fantastic coming-of-age tale. Some shotty acting at some points doesn't ruin the film, and it is really great overall."
" I would rather die than watch this again
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,1,"I literally created an account just so I could write this review. I wasted time creating this account, but it's nothing compared to the THREE HOURS wasted watching this movie. I would rather have been stabbed than watch this movie because at least stabbing has some action and emotion. Plus, I don't think a stabbing would've been that painful. I kept looking back at the TV, thinking ""is this still on??"" IT. NEVER. ENDED!!!! Please delete this movie!! It is unfair to subject the population to this! Please, show some compassion and delete it!!!"
" This film is about life. Not a hero's journey.
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,10,"People qho give low ratings think that there is no content. Nothing is happening in the film. There is no build-up, no conflict.
But that's the point. It's not meant to be like that. Otherwise it would be another commercial film; A guy with a problem to solve. Or a guy wanting something and getting it/not getting it.This film takes you on an experience of growing up. What changes occur during that time. How do kids react to parents at teenage. How changing father and homes affects them. How they think about life. How one usually grows in high school. If one is able to grow up and handle their own life? That's the content! It's a film about growing up.If you still think there's no content in the film. I can't argue. These are just my thoughts and I am happy to think it has content. You might have a different taste in films, go find another film."
" The feeling of time.
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,10,"Richard linklater does something with time. With Before trilogy, He makes moments timeless. And with this, he makes us realise how fast time flies by. And what is life. It's a simple story about a boy till he turns 18: so the title. Richard's films doesn't aim to offer entertainment, but to show reality and a little magic. Boyhood tells you to not worry about life's purpose. The childhood moments are soo relateable!
I just loved it. I even cried the morning after I watched it. It made me think of my own life differently. Thank you for making this movie!"
" Best movie of the decade
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,10,"The fact that Richard Linklater took 12 years to film this masterpiece is just incredible. So much time and devotion and it definitely shows. Sure, it's a long movie, but it needs to be. You literally get to watch a boy grow up and go to college. All the characters age in real life. They didn't feel like characters in a movie. It felt like you were watching some moments of your friends life. All the performances are perfect. Yes there are some cheesy lines, but it's supposed to be that way. When you're a teenager you stay a lot of cheesy, cringey things. It makes the movie feel so real. Best movie of the decade"
" FOUR STAGES OF ATTACHMENT
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,5,"When I first read the DVD cover I was convinced I wouldn't like it. But after all the hype and Best Picture win I had to force myself to watch a story about a typical kid growing up. Now the film seems to imply mom's (Patricia Arquette) bad men choices may be in part at fault for Mason's (Ellar Coltrane) typically irresponsible choices. However Mason reminds me of my nephew, who may be in or out of rehab when you read this, and he's had the same parents all of his life. 30 minutes into the film, I was moaning that I had 2 hours left. Please get better. Mom meets a college professor in one scene and they are married in the next, apparently not enough time to figure out he had a drinking problem. The kid's divorced father (Ethan Hawke) was still in his boyhood, but was more likeable than mom.Good performance about real life? Sure. Good enough to bore me to tears.Guide: F-bomb. Implied sex. No nudity."
" My Honest Opinion: a little below okay
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,3,"I didn't really pay attention to it when it came out, I just noticed it got really good reviews. So I watched it on Netflix last night. Let me just say, this movie is shot incredibly well. The scenes most of the time are beautiful, colorful, and the ambience is usually very good. The idea by Linklater to film a movie while the actors grow up is unique, different and very intriguing. This backfired on Linklater because Ellar Coltrane progressively started to become a worse and worse actor as this movie was filmed. The more complex lines and emotions he had to convey, his performance just got more and more disappointing. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke did amazing jobs. They were stellar throughout the whole movie, very convincing, but the dialogue in some parts of the movie was unrealistic. I thought the plot - a coming of age story - was not well planned out. It lacked a conclusion, which I wasn't really expecting much of one, but if you don't have one, at least make the ending meaningful in some way. Another thing about the movie I didn't like was the random scenes that didnt get acknowledged ever again throughout the film. Why would you add these points in the film when they have no impact on the characters? Some of it is genius, don't get me wrong, but when the bullies confront him and they never are seen again or have an impact on Mason, there is no point
The first hour of the movie was great, it made me keep watching. The next 45 minutes were okay, and still made me want to finish the film, but to be completely honest, I had to skip parts in the last 45 minutes. I thought the ending was cringy - not funny - and even the beginning endures some cringiness, but it just gets worse. I would give this movie 1 star because of how bad the plot is and the main actor at the end, but the idea behind it and the good beginning make me give it a 3 instead.Tldr; Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette had amazing performances and the idea behind the whole movie is different, but it did not make up for: the subpar plot lacking a conclusion, the poorly written script, the random scenes that never impact the characters or are relevant, and the terrible acting by Ellar Coltrane."
" Huge swing in a miss.
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,1,"I'm a huge fan of some of Linklater's stuff, but this film really is a giant swing and a miss.If you're going to have a long movie with virtually no story, you can't gamble on a hope that random child actors will grow into great actors. The adults, especially Hawke and Arquette, are professionals. But the movie centers so much around young people who you eventually realize just can't act.Films like Dazed and Confused or the Before series work because they rely on first-rate performances to carry it along. Had they not had those performances, the films would be awful. They would essentially be what Boyhood is. Except Boyhood is uniquely directionless and pointless. I'd heard that they didn't really write a story. They just made stuff up as they went along. And that's precisely what the film feels like.I was tempted to give this film a higher score for the very interesting gimmick of time-lapse they use and the superb acting of Hawke. But honestly, judging the film as a whole, it's an absolute mess. It has to be a 1-star, because it literally fails to do what a film is supposed to do. It fails at entertaining and fails at saying something important.If you'd like to see a LOONG film with no plot, awful young actors, and a predictable message about how young people are trying to figure life out and can't quite figure it out, then you'll love this film."
" A great movie, that flies over a lot of misinformed people's heads
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,10,"For those people writing how ""boring"" this movie is, and saying that ""nothing"" happens, are missing the whole point of what a movie is supposed to do.A movie is an emotional roller coaster, whether that follows from some gimmicky story or contrived plot is totally optional. Linklater does this completely on the rocky turbulence of growing up itself, in a way, boyhood is dramatised to relate to the aspects of growing up we can all relate to. Maybe you didn't drink, but you got your first car- Boyhood does its best for the viewer to relate themselves to such a picture.If you cannot comprehend this fact then the movie will lose all meaning to you, and you have rejected even participating in it before allowing yourself to take it in. In this way, you haven't really watched the movie. You're just waiting for it to end.The pacing in this movie was excellent for the most part, except maybe towards the VERY end, where it ends on a Hollywood, hopeful emote (wish it could've ended with a hug goodbye from the mother we grew up to sympathise with and love!)Otherwise, this movie really does its best with excellent writing and dialogue to bring out the essence of childhood and adolescence out of your deep consciousness again, not so you can be judged by them, but so you can dance with them- in the same way the pictures in the film dance with all the memories."
" 3 hours of nothing. Probably the least creative movie in history.
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,1,"The CONCEPT is unique sure...but that's all. It's boring. It's a regular troubled family. Oh, boy go to school. Oh, divorced dad take kids bowling. Oh, high school gossip. And who could forget that step-dad dinner tantrum? Actually there were 2 step-dads, both a little too forcibly evil. Maybe this ""10 year"" concept was doomed to fail?Even Birdemic tried harder than this. Massive flocks of attacking birds? Still more creative than this every-day family's life.I left a review of this a couple years ago on Netflix, but they recently deleted everyone's reviews along with the feature.This is yet another shining example of Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic being extremely flawed. Inflated scores that come from a tiny group of ""critics"" that are paid to be positive."
" Perhaps the most accurate depiction of growing up American ever
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,10,"I will show this film to my future children, grandchildren, etc and tell them before starting the movie, ""this is culturally 99% accurate and realistic and authentic to my childhood.""Extraordinary. Truly a landmark piece of storytelling. Though it does not conform to typical, mainstream plot devices, that's exactly what makes it so monumentally valuable beyond the dollar value. It conforms to realism, honesty, and emotional truth."
" The consistency of each scene and the long- run development of Boyhood make it a great, fun watch despite no dominant individual elements
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,7,"While it never feels like it coalesces into the awe- inspiring moments it has the potential for, Linklater makes each scene interesting and valuable to the overall film. It does add another layer to the film to have it filmed over 12 years and really have each character develop over time - we really saw Mason grow up, and it makes us feel much more connected to him. The performances are all excellent, especially Arquette's. Boyhood isn't the type of movie that focuses on a specific idea or theme that makes it successful, and instead is an observation on what a fairly regular American life is like, and the questions it raises are all broad questions about growing up. I didn't finish the movie with any specific element that amazed me, and there weren't individual scenes that did either, but the cumulative effect of each scene adding to the characters coupled with the development going on with each character makes it an extremely fun movie to watch. To me, it's not the groundbreaking, movie of the decade as many critics believe, but it is a very different, carefully made movie that's good on its own merits but really worth a watch due to the unique long scale of development that makes the coming of age so much more potent."
" A fascinating experiment in filmmaking
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,8,"Boyhood is a fascinating experiment in filmmaking. Watching the actors grow up over the course of 12 years is a truly unique experience. I also like that the main characters are good people - they're not perfect, but they're trying to do their best. This movie is like watching someone's home movies, if their home movies were beautifully shot and wonderfully acted. This was a very ambitious film and I'm glad I saw it. I also look forward to seeing ""Boyhood 2: Manhood"" in another 12 years."
" A vastly overrated film
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,4,"Critics seem to have been completely won over by this film and, frankly, that dumfounds me. It's pretty clear that the reason can be boiled down to it's interesting but gimmicky concept: it's filmed over 12 years. The focus of every single piece on this film since it was released. I'm yet to see a single review that does not mention this. It's apparently the only thing that they have to say about it. For me, if a film utilises a gimmick, the rest of the film must be at the same level and elevate beyond that one factor. Boyhood does not. I'm not saying that the film is without its merits. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke are great as Mason's parents and it is interesting to witness the passing of time and pop culture as the years go by. BUTThese are perhaps the only positive things I can say about the film. It comes across as merely a fragmented and loose series of snippets which we are expected to just come together but they don't. It is dreadfully overlong, which would not be a problem if the film had content to fill the running time with. Each scene seems to be building towards something and then doesn't deliver, and what is meant to come across as genuinely heartfelt moments from childhood come across as melodramatic and soap-opera in delivery. Boyhood is simply surprisingly lacking in interesting content. Linklater tries to address the 'bigger questions' that a boy growing into a man would go through, but it comes across as high school level philosophical drivel. I enjoy his other work, especially the Sunrise trilogy, but the fact that this is now seen as his masterpiece is a real shame. Most importantly of all, the film gives us no reason to follow this main character, especially for three hours. Mason, as portrayed by Ellar Coltrane, is simply not at all interesting, merely acting as a vessel to witness the events of the film rather than being a fully fleshed out character. I'm well aware that the film is meant to portray the ordinary which isn't my criticism, but it is possible to portray the ordinary in an interesting way without coming across as flat and boring. The fact that Boyhood has 100 percent on Metacritic is beyond me. It's quite possibly the most overrated film of the past few decades. I went into the cinema expecting a truly emotional, life affirming experience but came out feeling unfulfilled. I really do not understand the ecstatic reviews of this pretentious, dull film."
" Boyhood; Review
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,10,"So i have to say that this film surprised me as being an oddly charming story. The film follows a boy named mason from the age of 6 to 18 filmed over 12 years, I praise this film for being very experimented and well executed. Yes the film was a bit plotless, but that's what made this film relatable to everyday life and different to most over the top films. The child acting was suprisingly good apart from masons sister who was a bit annoying, the adult actors were great as well as the scenery used in this film. The film was a perfect mix between comedy, serious drama and romance. I would personally feel sorry for the producers if I didn't like this film as they spent so long making it."
" One of the best movie ever made
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,10,"An incredible story of a disassembled family, filming its 12 real years growth from when sons are kids to when they go to university, moment for moment in their life. It's a movie taken care in every small detail, nonpareil, one of the few that can be defined as art."
" One of the most awe inspiring projects ever undertaken
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,7,"Anyone who has seen any work from Richard Linklater knows what kind of a filmmaker he is. He waited between years to complete his ""Before"" trilogy and with Boyhood he has gone a step further and actually filmed the actor in real time. The real time extent here is a staggering 18 years and the coming of age aspect is enhanced by this fact alone. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette play the parents of the lead and the young actors, especially Ellar Coltrane is exceptional. This is a must watch for all cinema lovers."
" A kid grows up.. the end
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,2,Take any kid in your neighbourhood right now that you see playing outside or having fun with his friends and then imagine him growing up to when he's 16.. that's how interesting and riveting this movie is...
" You wanna know, or remember, what being a boy is like?
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,10,"A brilliant idea, brilliantly executed. Simply a masterpiece. It makes me emotional to think about it. Now In late middle age, it allows me to look back, to get into my own quite different story and to inhabit being a boy again."
" I'm not quite so sure about this..?
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,7,"My Rating : 7/10So, it's based around a family and the main character and how their life progresses over 12 years. It's 2 hrs 45 mins which is long for a Hollywood movie.The more I want to pass a judgment or review on it, the more I feel it's best left alone. The film is like life itself. Existential, family drama, wordy...all over the place, just like life. Or in other words...well...kinda boring?"
" Life itself.
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,10,Wonderous story of a boy journeying through life. I don't like any of Linklaters films. Not one. But this is spellbinding. So he finally gets one on the board!This film is not for anyone who needs pops and bangs in their movies. It's also not for 99% of Brainless North AmericansDefinitely one of the best films of the 21sr century.
" What happen with the ending
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,5,"In the beginning , i thought that Im gonna see a happy ending , or purpose of his life, or what he wanna be. But, i just saw he is smiling. Not mean anything. I thought they filmed about his succes or something in the end of movie"
" Ummm, you forgot the storyline
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,3,"Spending 12 years making something doesn't absolve you of the basic requirements of story and plot. Essentially, it provides you with more time to rewrite your script. A completely boring, cliche story, whose only redeeming aspect - and the reason everyone is raving - is because it took so long to make. Which is never a good reason to like anythin."
" Highly essential, one of the best ever
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,10,"Boyhood gets alot of praise, which in turn can heighten your expectations, and maybe it wont seem so great. I was wrong about that. This is a classic. Plot- Its genius and as simplistic as can be. It's life. You will quite literally watch a little boy grow up and face those trivial, life changing moments (each year of his life being 15 minutes run time) I related to alot of content in the film, so maybe I'm a bit biased here, but it just seemed so potent watching everything change, seeing every actor get older. Writing- Beautiful. Naturally written, with no forced moments. Never tries too hard to be profound, it always exemplifies those points subtly. Its not entirely quotable, yet the moments had are very memorable and sweet. Acting/Characters- These actors had to maintain an obligation to this film for 12 years, and they stay in character through it all. You can tell it was a very personal experience, for the actors are so natural in their roles (perhaps discredit Richard Linklaters daughter slightly) and every moment feel genuine, no cardboard melodrama at all. Quality-They took 12 years of change, and still made an important film out of it accordingly. The music is great, the scenery and straight forward cinematography was necessary to make it feel lifelike. It's a film that does what no other has done. Overall, Boyhood is fantastic, unless you cannot handle movies that are realistic and sentimental. It made me tear up, and as it went along I quite literally said ""they grew up so fast"" by the end of it. The ending alone was enough to make me sit there and contemplate hard. I think everyone and anyone should watch it. We all grew up, didn't we?"
" Boyhood will be remembered forever
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,10,"I have never related more to a movie in my entire life and that might be why I adore Boyhood. Richard Linklater used the same actors over the span of twelve years to make this movie and it is not just a gimmick. He captures small things that we tend to forget about while growing up, or, for adults, watching your kids grow up. Sometimes the child acting is rough around the edges but Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette are spot on and phenomenal. If someone else didn't care for this movie because it didn't touch them, I could even understand why, but this movie pounds through a very profound message. Our lives are all made up merely of moments that fall on top of one another. Sometimes you don't feel as you expect to in each moment, but at the end of it all, all these little moments add up to a life and reflecting on it all can be quite daunting. A lot of the deep messages come straight out of the mouths of the boy, Mason, and other side characters. This can be interpreted as bad writing, but when I look back to not so long ago when I was his age, I can see the similarities in our thinking. He talks like a lot of teens do and watching him makes you think about your own past and present angsty moments. Linklater specializes in films that portray realistic characters with realistic dialogue in realistic situations. This allows the audience to emotionally connect with his films. Boyhood is something special because there is at least one character for everyone that they can identify with. The movie is 2 hours 45 minutes but it flies by just like life does. This movie is nostalgic for anyone who grew up in the 2000s and is touching in so many ways. Boyhood is a modern classic."
" Unforgettable movie
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,10,"This movie is about us, our lives, the lives of our parents and children all in just two and a half hour. It touches you deeply and makes you examine your own life profoundly.
Great movie of life."
" Very realistic coming of age film.
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,8,"This film was so natural that I can't fault it in any way. Remarkably, the film was shot over a 12 year period, with the cast coming together for about 12 weeks every year for shooting. Therefore Mason is played by the same actor (Ellar Coltrane) through the entire span of the film, as well as the rest of the cast, off course, but I mention Mason here since he is the lead actor. This makes the film even more believable to see him grow throughout the film - from an innocent young boy to a typical teenager trying his first cigarette, having his first beer, thinking about girls, etc. Even the speech was very appropriate from kid to teenager to young adult. I must admit, I really enjoyed the movie's dialogue. Although the film is very long, I never found it boring. It was like watching someones (real) life play in front of me and it was interesting all the way. In fact, after almost 3 hours I was disappointed when the film ended - I wanted more.Although it is a film to savior, it is not the type of film I'd watch over and over, but having seen it I'm glad I did and will fondly remember it as a very good movie. A truly moving picture."
" Too Long but Some Nice Scenes
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,4,"Just when I thought this was another chronicle of Godless people living without a code, they threw in some worthwhile scenes with coded adults. A photography teacher, a corrections officer, a restaurant employer, a girlfriend, and a reformed dad all tried to teach our apathetic protagonist some valuable life lessons. Those were great scenes. They had to throw in some political propaganda against President Bush, for Obama and singer ""Bright Eyes,"" to appease their stars or themselves I imagine. At least they showed religious people as sincere and kind before they gently mocked the concept.Something this long starts to feel self-indulgent. But most scenes are thoughtful and carefully made. I'll give it a grudging recommendation."
" Watch it for the little moments.
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,9,"I loved Richard Linklater's approach with filming the movie. The audience literally sees a kid grow up on screen. This movie is not for the average movie goer. Most people these days watch movies to either see explosions or to get a laugh. I can see how some may think of Boyhood as boring, but I found it interesting. During the movie I felt attached to the characters and I would say that the characters are the most important part of this film. I am not an emotional person, but I found myself tearing up at a scene where Ethan Hawke's character is playing football with his two kids in a park. The scene was simple yet touching. It's these little moments that make Boyhood special. The only disappointment I had with the film was the acting, particularly with Lorelei Linklater (who plays Samantha). Lorelei Linklater was bland."
" 12 Years in making!
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,2,"If you are considering watching this movie, you must expect that you will watch a boy's life through 12 years as the description of movie say BUT what makes this movie interesting or special?... it is the 12 years in making!!!.. This movie was made to present an ordinary boy's life, his thoughts and prospective on living that came from his observations and interactions. I like this movie and would recommend it to everyone who would like to watch a special movie with an ordinary (if not without) plot OR at least like to watch sweet movie on ""regular"" life."
" Overhyped gimmick movie
",2018-05-30 00:00:00,2,"My biggest focus in a film tends to be the characters and interactions, and that is a huge problem in this film, and a big reason why I don't tend to like gimmick films in general. This film seems to be more infatuated with its gimmick than telling an intriguing story.Production started from 2002 and finished in 2013, and covers a family, focusing on a boy named Mason as he grows up. Reportedly, the script hadn't been completed by the time filming started beyond basic plot points and an ending, and it unfortunately shows badly in the final product. The most basic elements of storytelling are blatantly mishandled as the film chugs along at a snail's pace through its nearly three hour runtime seeming to make things up as it goes, which is likely what happened given the gimmick. It's essentially a slice of life story with a few plot devices placed to try to give the film some narrative to follow. It doesn't push any boundaries or try to be creative in any way other than in taking ten years to film, which is hardly a matter of talent rather than one of patience.The film starts off with its strongest conflicts right at the start, as the mother, Olivia, is recently divorced and falls for her teacher, Bill, who becomes an abusive alcoholic. This feels like one of the few elements that was placed in the story from the beginning, but even it didn't grip me. I grew up with an abusive alcoholic father, and Marco Perella's performance as Bill didn't convince me, as the subtleties seemed off. While it seemed right on paper, the execution felt like he was saying his lines off a teleprompter. Anyways, the movie shortly moves past that and goes on to focus on the family as Mason and Samantha who are now in high school, and it's nothing we haven't seen a million times before, and experienced at some point in our lives, which I suppose is the point, but it seems counter-intuitive to go to the movies to experience the worst part of your life over again. As Mason grows up throughout the movie, I find him less and less likeable as he gets extremely pretentious and depressing, to which point I agree with all those who antagonize him and call him out on his teenage melodrama. Samantha is not much better as she is unreasonably rude to her mother, who is by far the most likeable character in the entire movie. Mason Sr. is alright, and he gets a nice positive arc from being a loser to getting his life together and being a more active father throughout their lives, but I don't feel Mason Jr. quite follows along the same lines. He's simply not matured by the end of the film and it left me very disappointed. The real climax of the film involves Olivia having a mental breakdown about how her life has turned out, and it's actually quite effective, but short-lived, as the movie feels it more important to end with an artsy-fartsy yet cliche scene with teens blabbing about life while watching the sunset at the beach. Seriously, teenagers are just awful.In other words, this film is basically my life with a whole lot less conflict and an even worse teenager than myself. If this concept had worked out to make an entertaining film, it would have been an incredibly lucky lightning in a bottle scenario, and unfortunately that didn't happen. The family didn't have much chemistry, and the children didn't grow into as strong of actors as the parents were from the start. I understand the attempt at becoming a cultural phenomenon, but the excruciating runtime is ultimately undeserved. It can be an interesting diversion for some people, but I'm not entirely surprised it didn't resonate as well as may have been expected through its lengthy production."
" Finally see it and regretting the waste of time that it was
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,1,Interesting concept and epic fail no lessons learned no heart no nothing. Oh what could have been....the mom and daughter try to
" Seems that you'll either love it or hate it
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,6,"Full disclosure: I'm writing this after skimming through other reviews. And I was struck by how many 1 and 10 ratings people gave this movie. No many middle number ratings given. But maybe the best art tends to be that way?Personally, I found it hard to watch due to the slow pace, the banal acting (except for Ethan Hawke, but of course his personality was in the script) and the ordinary cinematography. Not one character really drew me in or made me care that much about how things would work out for them.The ending scene when he finally arrives at college and finally finds life making some sense to him is good, but then you remember he was high at that moment, so was he truly fulfilled?Some serious editing needs to happen to get this from 2 hours, 45 minutes to maybe 1:45."
" Good but flawed
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,7,"Not at all bad and well worth a watch. The main strength is seeing children growing up and people ageing in the same film, which is remarkable. But that for me was also the weakness, in that it was trying to cover events over such a long period of time that it was very episodic, and not able to focus enough. You have to be on your toes to pick up the bits of dialog that tell you what's happened since the last installment, and I'd agree that parts of the script felt a little contrived. For me this would have worked better as a 10 or 12 part series, which would have done more justice to the material, and it could have been epic."
" Insightful!
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,8,"I don't remember why I added this movie to my IMDB Watchlist, partially 'cuz it was added almost a year ago, but was glad having watched it. I am a foreigner, an Asian to be precise, so almost all the transitions the trio family goes through was eventful and so different from how our day-to-day life here is. Asians, a majority of them, are inclining themself towards the western lifestyle and somehow I ended up hating this modern trend the Eastern world was trying to emulate. I always respected my culture and its style of dealing with family issues. With this biased opinion of mine, I now would like to share what was really special about this movie.The number of divorces Mason's mother goes through, the biological father's consistent efforts to make his children get the best out of their life and the troubles Mason and Samantha go through everytime they shift and many other such mundane happenings of a typical Westerner were very interesting and made me realise that Western lifestyle is weird but natural in its own way.I always keep certain movies close to my heart, especially the ones that have the power to induce a new line of thought, and Boyhood has certainly won a place in there.Oh...yeah, I remembered why I added this to my watch list, the movie was shot over a period of WHOPPING 12 YEARS!!!!! YUP, it was filmed just as Ellar Coltrane grew. Ethan Hawke's performance was deep and it is saddening he was only nominated for an Academy award for best actor in supporting role.Go ahead and give it a try, I am sure it will test your patience!! :)"
" Experiment Needs Better Script
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,4,"Actors probably enjoyed making this more than the audience does watching it. Maybe it's Hollywood's attempt at reality TV. Novel but mostly boring. With a better script this experiment could have been great. Why are so many people down on Mason? His sister, his two step-dads, his boss. Gets repetitive. Highlights: Mason Snr's scenes in the car with the kids. In one he pulls over to insist they tell him more about their week (since he last saw them) and the second time he gives Mason Jnr a CD compilation of the Beatles' music post-breakup then gives an interesting analysis of it/them."
" Hilarious!
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,1,"There were many times I laughed out loud in a theatre full of people opening weekend. Especially at the hilariously overacted abusive stepfather throwing things at the main character, and yelling:""I DON'T EVEN LIKE SQUASH!""I was the only one laughing."
" Nice take on coming-of-age but it doesn't fully deliver
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,5,"(Minor spoilers possible)The worst part of the movie was for me probably the ending, as it was open-ended and I feel like many of the lifelines demanded a stronger closure. Especially the protagonist's sister's life got left out of the story starting halfway.It had a potential esp. thanks to the longterm recording, but the main idea isn't quite there. What this movie does right at places is leading us through the contrast of how people change through growing up and how exactly the situations change around them. The characters felt flat at times (the mid part gets us the most involved) and towards the end even out of nowhere nihilistic, which struck me as overdone at places.
I must say I loved the part with the teacher about the art giving him the waking-up call.The movie ends as the protagonist enters the college and I feel like it could've been better if they just waited for him to enter the stage of a working adult (how did his career and personal life turns up after everything he's gone through, hm?)So all in all, watch for the minor events that show life contrasting during different periods while growing up, but be ready for rather a slow movie with boring passages and mediocre ending."
" Magnificence in its Ambition, but slightly lacking in its delivery
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,8,"I have to balance out the difference between the magnificence of the achievement, and its overall flow as a film, and in doing this, I find myself conflicted in ways I haven't been before, when reviewing a film. BOYHOOD is a fantastic work, with regards to what it is you are watching when you view the film. A time capsule in motion, centered around Ellar Coltrane, the boy in question, playing Mason, the titular character. Watching him grow from a boy to a young man is the meat of this movie, and it delivers, once you step back and really take in what it is you are absorbing. But the conflict, for me, is in the flow of the film. There are scenes that I find to be unnecessary, at least with respect to plot. There are scenes that are in the film purely for the sake of the overall experiment, instead of the narrative, and although I don't find them too distracting, it does linger in my mind when a scene is presented that has no overall impact on the film itself. Characters are introduced and discarded as quickly as they come in, representing a mere fragment in Mason's life. Don't get me wrong--there is value in what you see, but its impact on the overall film is lacking, and sometimes distracting when it leads nowhere.Thank goodness this is not the case for the overall film's quality, in which there were many moments of sweeping excellence to make up for its minor flaws. I have to give the film an 8, against the swarm of critics who gave it full marks, because I think the experiment got in the way of the narrative. That being said, BOYHOOD is CERTAINLY is a film I would recommend that everyone see, if for no other reason than to witness the spectacle of so many excellent actors and creators moving through time in real-time, with the reflections of America's ever-changing landscape in the background of every scene. Nobody delivers a poor performance here, from Linklater's daughter playing Mason's sister, to Ethan Hawke playing their father. The music was well done, save for some of the lyrics of songs written by Ethan Hawke for the film, since he plays an overly ambitious but ultimately unfulfilled musician, which I hope was the point of his relatively average music. Touching in its placement and purpose, but lacking in the kind of delivery normally associated with films and their powerful moments.I struggled for a long time trying to rate this film, and wish I could give it at least a 9, for the impressive achievement that it is, in that something like this has never been attempted before. But as it happens with new ground, you don't always shine absolutely brilliant when you first blaze the trail. It's filled with dangers, misfortunes, and mistakes, and ultimately learning about what to do and what not to do in the future. It will be interesting to see what the impact of such a film will have on the world of film, as time goes on."
" Save yourself from watching it
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,1,"God where to start here? I can easily say this was the most boring film ever made! Linklater basically directed something so his daughter can have memory of growing up and that is it! Characters are dull, acting pacing and anything that makes one film a film is completely absent! Story is about uninteresting family with uninteresting lives and who ever calls this an artistic film is a complete idiot! Anyhow don't waste 3h of your time on this because you will hate cinema for life! This film makes you hate Cinema!"
" Overrated
",2018-04-06 00:00:00,3,One of the most Overrated films in history & its sooooooo boring.
" Story falls short
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,6,"Boyhood is directed by Richard Linklater and is a film based on growing up through the transition of childhood to teenage-hood. It's not such a unique story although what makes Boyhood so special is the fact that it began filming and 2002 and ended in 2013. Every character in the film literally grows up right before your eyes, which is really awesome. So Boyhood starts with a reasonably compelling story which then develops, reaching such a climatic peak surrounding serious domestic conflict. But unfortunately this nearly 3hr long film doesn't continue to build beyond the halfway mark. When the male lead progresses into teenage-hood I feel the story really tanks. The remainder of the film is just bland and uneventful. The lead becomes an increasingly unlikable character. And the movie ends on such a low, with the lead attempting to have some philosophical view on life. Boyhood feels like watching the boring life audience members wish to escape from when seeing a film. This films lacks the emotional weight of other coming of age stories seen in films like Moonlight. Boyhood should just be seen for its achievement of filming for 11 years. It's unfortunate that the story falls short, so therefore I give Boyhood a 6."
" Great movie
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,8,"It's a very simple movie about the life of a boy from his early childhood to the college days 
There is nothing thrilling in this movie it just show the development of the boy , and I really liked it 
You just feel like you're living with the boy and you watch him grow so fast . I think this movie is very different from other movies , and it's worth watching I want to salute Linklater for this special film"
" Boyhood
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,8,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, Boyhood tells the fictional story of a boy from adolescence to adulthood. It is a spectacle in and of itself because it was filmed in a span of twelve years. Richard Linklater patiently tells the story of Mason as we watch him grow up in front of our eyes. At times, the film is boring because the story is so mundane and tells a simple tale of growing up. The characters are all interesting and add a lot to the story. There are some weird moments in the story like when Patricia asks Ellar if he was drinking and smoking weed. He answers yes and she seems fine with it. I will remind you that he was only fifteen when he was drinking and smoking weed. The ending is touching and shows us that love can be found.The acting is very good. Ellar Coltrane performs very well throughout his various years. Patricia Arquette and Lorelei Linklater both perform very well. Ethan Hawke always delivers a stunning performance and this one was a stunner.The pacing is slow. Richard Linklater takes his time telling a story that deserves to be told. The scale of the movie is huge and that is what makes the movie great. The runtime is very long and isn't for the average movie goer.Pro: The twelve years of filming, an interesting premise, some touching moments, good acting, Ellar Coltrane and Ethan Hawke's performance, the elegance that Richard Linklater takes in creating this story, and a very touching endingCons: Some slow pacing, an overlong runtime, some weird moments in the story, and parts of the story are extremely mundaneOverall Rating: 8.2P.S. Watching Mason/Ellar grow up was very touching. His journey through life is a tale of highs and lows, ups and downs, victories and defeats. All in all, Richard Linklater truly deserved to win Best Picture and his patience to create such a great film is a feat that should be admired."
" It's not about the storyline, it's about the experience
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,9,"This is totally my kind of film. I am not into films with complicated stories or a lot of action. I am all about the feelings and experiences. Although I will not put any spoilers in my review, that really would not have made any difference, because I could tell you what actually happens in the film in two sentences. It's not about that. It's about a boy noticing a guy is not as great as he seems before anyone else, or how he notices that his mother is meeting someone new at a party, just from looking at their conversation from a distance. My parents never divorced, so I wouldn't know what that is like, but I think that despite all the problems, it seems like in the end there is some sort of a tight-knit family, even though everybody has moved on.I really like Ethan Hawke in this as well. Great acting."
" IT TOOK 12 YEARS TO MAKE
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,10,BOYHOOD. IT TOOK TWELVE YEARS TO MAKE. TWELVE YEARS. TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE? THAT DIDNT TAKE TWELVE YEARS TO MAKE.
" Unique and ambitious
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,6,"Unique and ambitious idea to film a movie with the same cast over 12 years but this was slow at times especially in the 2nd half. I kept waiting for something to happen, nothing ever did. Just the story of a boy named Mason from the age of 7 to when he goes to college. He deals with his parents divorce, adjusts to new stepfamilies and explores his own identity. No antagonists except a couple of drunk, abusive step dads. Ethan Hawke & Patricia Arquette do a great job as flawed but realistic parents.A clever flowing narrative of life though. No dates or times or given to show the passage of time you just figure it out by changes and aging faces. Ultimately I came away from this underwhelmed especially after all the hype. I think I was meant to feel nostalgic but mostly meh."
" I want to poke this movie with a stick... just to see if it does something.
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,2,"There is only one word that can describe this audiovisual project (I reject to call this collage of unrelated scenes a movie): Tedious. Absolutely nothing happens: Boring people living their boring life, growing boring kids that keep being boring and becoming boring adults. And it lasts 3 hours! The cinemathography is astounding for such a borefest, but no image, no photography, no makeup effect could keep this movie alive. There were a lot of scenes that could have saved this movie if somebody decided to exploit them, for example there was a moment where the guy that was living with the female protagonist was asked by her to relax the huge amount of rules he had. This could be a moment they could have had a conversation about the importance of rules vs freedom, a negociation of sorts about those rules, a dramatic moment with the male exploding in violence... It was full of potential. It could be anything. What this movie does? Nothing, it goes to the scene of the teenagers with his biological dad goint to the baseball park. And thats it. I give the extra point because following the same actors for 12 freaking years was incredible and the cinemathography was incredible. Still it should be completely avoided, unless other people's boring life is enough to you."
" I hated this film
",2018-01-09 00:00:00,1,"I am sure people will hit ""No"" on this review just because they hate my headline. Now ""Boyhood"" was about watching a child growing up. Yes it was filmed over several years but the film itself felt like it took ""years to watch"".The film would have been better served if the director cut the film down by 30 minutes. Filmed over 12 years with the same cast, Richard Linklater's BOYHOOD is a groundbreaking story of growing up as seen through the eyes of a child named Mason (a breakthrough performance by Ellar Coltrane), who literally grows up on screen before our eyes. However the story is really about seeing his loser of a mother not realizing she is doomed to keep repeating her mistakes. Take it from me ""This film is only loved by people who want to sound superior"""
" ""Up"" Series Lite...
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,7,"""Boyhood"" has been pending on my watch list for quite a long time, yet I resisted that movie. The word that came to mind whenever I was reading the summary and the praiseful comments was ""gimmick"". All these ""12 years in the making"", a boy's life spanning the time of the film's release (the opposite actually) and the whole philosophical contemplation about the daringness of the project left me cold. Retrospectively, I was wrong... but I'm glad I was, because I waited so long I could experience first one of the greatest movies of all time: Michael Apted's ""Up"" series.Not twelve years but five decades in the making, not one but fourteen persons, British men and women followed since the age of seven and with a glimpse on their lives every seven years, the last edition was 2012's ""56 Up"". I binge-watched the documentary for two weeks and it was almost a metaphysical experience, there was no plot and no character's arc, not pre-written anyway. It was just life itself with the usual share of twists, surprises, deaths, marriages, separations, strikes of luck, and people just growing, getting more or less optimistic or blasé, depending on their respective experiences, making the whole series more thrilling, riveting and inspirational than any fictional creation.I was surprised by how ludicrously lacking the name ""Apted"" the comments on ""Boyhood"" were, I don't know how much of an inspiration it was to Richard Linklater, maybe he didn't have ""Up"" in mind, but once you finish the documentary, ""Boyhood"" can only strike as a feeble attempt to duplicate ""Up"" from the perspective of a little boy (played by a natural Ellan Coltrane); his sister (Linklater's daughter Lorelei) and his divorced parents played by Rosanna Arquette and Ethan Hawke. So, in the process we also follow the evolution of two adults from their younger years of wandering and wondering to their term-coming forties.The film ends with a young boy who still hasn't figured yet what to do exactly with his life and seems to take it as it comes whereas the adults, especially the mother, question their accomplishments. This is a credit to the film's intelligence, it doesn't try to put an artificial narrative, it doesn't have a specific arc, it just consists on hazardously assembling the pieces of a puzzle whose big and final picture is the meaning of life. Needless to say that the only satisfying note the film ends with is that every player of this twelve-year slice of life hasn't ended in depression, drugs and other cliché situation. On that level, ""Boyhood"" hit the right chords.So I'll play the devil's advocate: one of the main criticisms the film received is that the story wouldn't have been one tenth as interesting on a classic format. True, but if you take one year to make a film, you'll be more likely to spice it up a bit with conventional twists. Linklater fulfilled the dream of a lifetime, making sure his players would be available whenever he needed them, it wasn't the safest bet, so he couldn't possibly make this film with a specific plot in mind, that would have undermined the whole edifice and deprived it from that air of fresh unpredictability. Besides, Linklater knows what the audience wants, to see little Mason evolving, as superficial as it is, it was the film's reason to exist.
And we see that little kid growing up, embracing life and its share of injustices and predicaments, authority figures with conflicting advice, an absent father and a mother moving from places to places. Mason and his sister didn't have the perfect life, they grew up without roots so that might explain why at the end they turn out to be so free-spirited. We don't know if it's an artistic take from Linklater but the way the format of the film and the story overlap and influence the experience reminds me of other movies where the form defines the content like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or Hitchcok's ""Rope"", not that the film plays in the same league though.
""Boyhood"" is good filmmaking and never really throws the concept to our faces which is good, to a certain extent. I suppose Linklater didn't want to punctuate his movies with ""two years later"" but sometimes, the lack of chronological indicators can be confusing and you can't really tell the change. The film seems to follow a flow as natural as life but the inclusion of some bits rather than others is questionable and make you wonder whether the real focus was ""boyhood"" or any part of life. Mason starts as an insecure kid, then a girl approaches him with a nice comment on his haircut, later, he's bullied and before you know it, he's got many girlfriends. Despite being the center of our attention, Mason is sometimes harder to reach than the meaning of life. And the same goes with other characters, first stepfather starts as a disciplined man and then he turns out to be an alcoholic, one is an Afghanistan veteran and then becomes your typical bigot, Patricia Arquette is your struggling mother and all of a sudden, becomes an Academic teacher, what for the next twelve years? President of the USA? I don't think that was the kind of underlying messages the film called for especially when the sister started as a pre(co)cious girl with a lot of potential but then turned into your average superficial teenager. I did enjoy though Ethan Hawke's parts, I think he was one of the best things about the film.In the ""Up"" series, each protagonist had twenty minutes of screen-time in each episode, so you can all compact their lives in a ""Boyhood"" runtime, the film had an interesting promise but overall, it's very uneven as if it was victim of its own device."
" Astounding odyssey through one boy/man's life - needs to be seen to be truly appreciated
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"The premise of 'Boyhood' is at once really simple and spectacularly innovate and unique - film a kid growing up through primary and high school. Sounds quite unexciting, but it has literally never been done before - Mason (Coltrane) is show growing from age 7 until 18 (and so is Samantha, director Linklater's actual daughter), filmed at various stages of his adolescence over 12 years. There's no subtitles for what year/season it is - it's up to you to determine at what stage of his life he's at, but the scenes manage to flow quite easily, even though he ages multiple months/hairstyles each time.The soundtrack to the film is fantastic and a trip down memory lane itself - Coldplay's 'Yellow' opens the film, before Blink 182's 'Anthem Part Two' and Weezer's 'Island In The Sun' instantly date the year as 2001. There was plenty of great/likeable songs throughout - 2002 has The Hives 'Hate to Say I Told You So' and The Flaming Lips 'Do You Realize', 2008 has Vampire Weekend's 'One (Blake's Got a New Face)' and Foo Fighters 'Let It Die', 2010 has The Black Keys 'She's Long Gone' & Kings of Leon's 'Radioactive' and 2011 has Gotye's 'Somebody That I Used to Know', as well as plenty of others. There's also a splash of his Dad's (Hawke) influences, with Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney & George Harrison songs appearing for old time's sake. One of the best scenes to me was when he gives Mason a compilation of post-Beatles recordings and passionately explains how/why it's important!So, is this Oscar bait? Perhaps. Sure, it's long (2 hours 40min), but it takes you on such a journey that by the time Mason's in the final years of high school, you've almost forgotten that you first met him as a 7 year old! With a budget of less than $3 million, it's truly astounding the commitment the four main actors (Arquette is very believable as the mum), the director and production staff put in over 12 years. I can only imagine how long editing has taken!At its heart, 'Boyhood' is a family drama - with lots of laughs thrown in, don't worry! - that tells a very realistic and well-imagined story of finding who and what you want to be in the world. It will be interesting to see if Coltrane continues acting now. The film's whole point is essentially asking - how do you recall the formative years - both the highs & lows - that shaped you?"
" Time and relationship, on film
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,9,"What this film lacks in plot it makes up for with poignance, realism and the passage of time. These characters grow on you and with you...Linklater's asked many questions about the meaning of life and love before, but this time the questions seemed to write themselves. Beautiful stuff."
" BOYHOOD (2014) ~ 10/10*s ~ redefines what 'epic' is
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,10,"BOYHOOD
2014
Dir.: Richard Linklater
Starring: Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke10 *s out of 10Don't worry if Uncle Bill or Cousin Matt said this was ' long and boring ' .. we've all heard that before from people who will go to the movies twice a year - and see the two worst films of that twelve month period ..... EVERYBODY should adore and respect this picture - it is, frankly, as brilliant as they come, as universally masterful as they come, as epic as they come .. and was probably the best picture of 2014, outside of the underground, world cinema, etc ...... and BOYHOOD is damn thoroughly entertaining; in fact, it's as entertaining as a film can possibly be - in that extremely immediate way that Linklater is excellent at .. when it comes to these youth themes, and this style, i think it's fair to say he can be crowned king .. btw, he REALLY doesn't just rely on a gimmick here (as a glorified handful of detractors have said) - in fact, the film succeeds so well at every stage that the viewer often forgets about the unique way it was shot, and will find themselves (at least the first time or two around) too busy relating with and/or empathising with Mason's experience - as a kid growing up over a twelve year period in post-9/11 Texas - to examine the time-lapse technique too closely .. but damn, the crazy technique IS fascinating, but this just isn't one of those films of style over substance , b/c this is substance on full-blast; this is a film-for-the-ages, and as absolutely epic as they come; Linklater went all-out here and managed to make a film bigger than life."
" too much about not nearly enough
",2017-12-14 00:00:00,2,"I was expecting an excellent viewing experience, instead there was three hours of tedium. It was painful to watch all the drama and disappointment that the central character experienced. There seemed to be more JudgeJudy than Ozzie and Harriet in this film. Emotional pain does not equal insight or entertainment."
" Completely unwatchable no every level
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,1,"SPOILER ALERT! It's awful. The fact that that it took 12 years to film would be much more impressive if they had filmed something worth watching. The 7 hour run time is a little much as well..........only 2 hours? Really? The Story itself lack any kind of substance. It's suppose to depict real life. Do you know what people don't want to see when they go to the movies? Real life! We have real life every day, we go to the movies to escape that. Also the mother is depicted as a needy desperate woman who marries two of the same man, with equally disastrous results. I think that plot device was to create sympathy for her but it just made her come off as desperate and stupid. There is no story arc. The film starts off with the same emotion as it ends and plays that same note through out the entire film. The novelty of the 12 year shoot quickly loses any meaning at all when nothing happens. How this film got nominated for anything is a mystery. Patricia Arquette winning best actress was the biggest mistake in the history of awards."
" amazing
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,9,I am totally surprised that how could a project like this movie to survive. I feel it is like something real when I was watching it. I feel that I am living with the characters their own special details of their 12 years in just two hours. the girl acting was superb when she was a girl but not any more when she became adult. while the opposite happening to the boy
" Something special
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,10,"I always complain on movies that last too long. It is extremely hard to make a movie longer than usual hour and a half or maybe two that will hold viewers attention at the same level till the end. 99% of 3 hours long movies become boring at one point, even if they are crowded with story, plot and action. And then movie shows up that has almost no plot at all and after 3 hours I find myself wondering why is it already over. Movie follows an ordinary life of an ordinary boy and his family from his early childhood till acceptance to college. If they continued till his natural death in old age I think I would still watch all 20 hours of it in single breath. Beside fact it is made in real time with same cast over 12 years and that Mason literally grows up in front of our eyes, I'm not sure what else makes this movie so special. But it is very special. And beautiful. ""It's three hours of fresh air.""10/10"
" The reason we love film
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,10,"A truly beautiful viewing experience. The story feels very real and that is the films biggest appeal in my opinion. The decision to actually work on the film for 12 years and actors literally growing up on screen worked great. I have heard some people complaining that it is too slow and the character of Mason not being interesting enough. I have to disagree since there are thousands and thousands of people like him out there in the world, a bit gloomy, quiet with an artistic soul and most of them will never get their own story on film and I believe that every single person has a story in them. And that is where Boyhood excels, it brought us a simple story about a boy growing up and nailed all the vital elements without any overblown drama. The film will probably take you down your own memory lane and I am sure every viewer will find something for themselves to identify with. I could not recommend this highly enough. The film is almost 3 hours long and when I finished it I wished it was 5 or 6 hours long. A story for your mind and soul accompanied by the most perfectly chosen soundtrack. The music elevates the film to an even higher level.Thank you Richard Linklater and everyone else involved in the making of Boyhood for reminding us why we love watching films so much."
" thinking
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,7,"Labor, thoughts and methods of implementation, different things can emerge, just as they are in the film. For a certain patience for 12 years, even if it is accomplished by work discipline, deserves admiration. In this time frame, the shooting was completed in 45 days in total. As well as the fancy movements that should be considered too much, Based on a certain realism. We are able to analyze certain things in social sense while watching an ordinary family life. Instead of pointing at a spot and going over it, it places all the characters in order and simply. that we are beyond the ordinary Hollywood dream, taking the life of an American family of modest. You can see how things have changed as individuals period along with this idea of ​​being dragged towards the youth from childhood shots, you can catch the ways in which people grasp the chance to be dragged. In short, there are plenty of parts where you can find and feel something from yourself. The marriage only establish direct relations with the main focus being liked by people that every step in the destruction reveals.As a result of this submission of the year waiting period in a time zone three hours giving a uniform appearance in terms of fiction. Although it is a drama taste, it is also certain that it has its own peculiarity with the help of frequent stage passages. The criticism of the political and political order of the United States does not escape attention. Barack Obama's admiration is also expressed; He became home favorite movie in 2014."
" Almost perfect, from concept to release
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,10,"Linklater has done some amazingly arty things throughout his largely unheralded career as an indie filmmaker. From plot less party triumphs to cartooned dreamscapes, he's tried a vast number of approaches and ideas to rejuvenate and enhance and upend Hollywood cliché. ""Boyhood"" is arguably his sweetest attempt, and certainly his best in terms of coherence and amicability... it's impossible not to relate to this simple story about an off-beat boy named Mason growing up in suburban America. His sister too is a marvel, especially when hitting her early teens (after which she turns mediocre and takes a backseat to the star, her younger brother. Mason is consistently easy-going throughout the 12 years of filming, almost irritating so until he finds his passion in photography. Technology intrudes and progresses too, but not in a way that jeopardizes the storyline. His dad (Hawke) is an enviable father figure who spoils his kids on the weekends, and his mom (Arquette) shines as a complex mother who's got issues that she never allows to overshadow her life or that of her kids. Seamlessly integrated from start to finish, it's as though all movies are built this way when in fact it's such an original that viewers will likely need to remind themselves that it took over a decade to put this work of genius together. It's one drawback is a heavy hand hammering home a hippy mentality - very few people who live the hippy lifestyle have it so good. That being said, it's definitely worth investing two hours of your life on. The characters become infectious and you wonder how those 12 years went by as quickly and as quietly as life itself."
" Still the best movie ever made
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,10,"Art is about life. Art is about letting you feel life as it was, as it is, as it could be, as it will be, as it should be... etc. This movie is about life. It's letting you feel life in a very real way. Life's about moments, linked to each other by time. In a circular way; nothing ever changes really. This movie is made of moments in time. This movie is the perfect form of art. Boyhood represents life, in its best way."
" Heart-warming film about growing up
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,9,"An all-encompassing film about growing up and coming of age. Of course, the movie being actually filmed over 12 years with the same cast adds an extra very rare dimension to it. Ellar Coltrane gives a great performance as the dreaming little boy, maturing into the uncertain adolescent, with all the ups and downs of growing up thrown in. Ethan Hawke is excellent as the estranged but loving father; Patricia Arquette is very realistic as the troubled mother with her string of drunken lovers. The first half of the film could almost have been called Girlhood, because it is almost as much about Samantha as Mason; and Lorelei Linklater is quite brilliant as the smart-alec but lovable older sister. Although the film essentially has no plot, it is a really feel-good film about the terrors and wonders of growing up. A big thumbs up."
" love
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,10,"It takes a great amount of faith and patience to create something like that. I mean 12 years! I watched this film first in 2014, and re- watched it few years later...now. I remember that after watching it for the first time, I felt a great amount of peace coming upon me. This film makes you let go of your worries. It surrounds you with trust, love and #pixie dust. Thank you to everyone who made this come true."

This film is a little gem of a story, and all the actors were very easy to fall in love with. Sure the story is slow paced for my liking, but knowing how (long) this was filmed, more than made up for the pace. It's a well deserved 8/10 from me"
" Simple but
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,10,"In my opinion this is an excellent movie. It talks about ordinary life situations and problems. It's a realistic film that doesn't need extra suspense, melancholy or any other emotions. Looking a real growing up child with all the usual issues that a child faces by his life, is enough emotional. It doesn't need to evolve specific situations in which everyone experience in his life, just a look and a remembrance of feelings of it. At the end, looking how a mother closes her life chapters and opens the last one and how she feels abut it, also looking the abandon of the childhood and opening of the totally new life chapter for the boy, is the apex of the emotion that this film give."

" Soft, brilliant, and familiar
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,8,"(Spoiler Alert) No there are not twists or climatic situations where you expect something huge to happen. This is a movie more like your life, more subtly wasted through time, often with a couple of family problems where you are a mere observer. The younger ones, as usual, observe and astonish on how disturbed older people are, and probably ask why. The movie is soft, and familiar, but its brilliance is exactly at that point, where it's more real than other movies which depict events bigger than their real aspects. Often biggest problems go on in our lives when we are just do not care much, and it goes by as if nothing much happened. Boyhood is a typical teenage life in a nutshell, not much flavor or ecstasy, but some honesty."

I am very glad my girlfriend told me to see this. This movie moves you. It starts out with Mason (Coltrane), as a young kid. He goes through life as a normal boy; school, moving, parents divorce, love, and college.There were incredible performances in this film. Eller Coltrane as Mason was great. Patricia Arquette was phenomenal, deserving of the Oscar for best supporting actress, and Ethan Hawke was amazing as well. It is a shame that the average Birdman beat this astonishing 12-Year masterpiece for best picture. Richard Linklater hit it out of the park on this one. Don't believe the ""Nothing happened"", ""Waste of Time"" reviews. Watch it for yourself!"

",2017-05-12 00:00:00,10,"We hear Coldplay's ""Yellow"", a song from 14 years prior, as we see a boy lying in the grass staring up at the sky - something familiar. Moments like these are sewn throughout ""Boyhood"". Small fleeting moments that wouldn't be shown in any other movie because they would slow the story down and be removed in place of an action scene or a romance that doesn't quite belong.""Boyhood"" formally chronicles the life of a boy, Mason, from his youth until his high school graduation. Richard Linklater, a virtuoso in dialogue and the development of believable, human characters, created the film by shooting parts during the summer times of twelve years - a wonderfully unique way of showing genuine growth and the changes that can and do occur in anyone's, but in this case, Mason's life.What makes ""Boyhood"" excel and go beyond its interesting period of development is its attention to detail, attention to the world we all lived in during those years, regardless of our ages. In these years of Mason's aging, we hear things about ""The Dark Knight"" being in theaters, we see Halo being played, and we see Mason and his dad talking about what the state of the ""Star Wars"" universe may be. ""Boyhood"" has this interesting way of encapsulating the dozen years it was filmed in each of its scenes, yet it all works perfectly as a whole.""Boyhood"" on its face value is very interesting, but it's the small moments caught on camera and the words written for the actors that extend it to being an achievement. One of the greatest honors one could give to a bit of writing is the material's way of feeling real, that's what's in ""Boyhood"". While it's about Mason, his friends, and his family, its grasp extends beyond that. By showing the life events and the time periods, there's at minimum one thing from ""Boyhood"" that will reel you in and make you recall bits from your past in the forms of things you said to your parents, moments you had with your friends, to even whole chapters in your life.Realistic characters have been brought to life since movies were made, but not in recent memory have we seen several chapters of life be chronicled, and so believably. ""Boyhood"" is a delight for its entire 165 minute run-time (which doesn't run at all too long) due to the flawless portrayals of its characters by Ethan Hawke as Dad, Patricia Arquette as Mom, and Ellar Coltraine as Mason."
" Life transmitted by a camera
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,9,"Amongst many aspects of the cinema, one of them is to be a window into life, and few movies in the cinema can do it as perfectly as boyhood, with its bold idea of ​​being recorded for 12 years, he succeeds in simply portraying life, with All your choices, mistakes, hits, dramas, loves, disappointments, disappointments and hope. Simply telling the story of a mother and her two children, the plot goes through the mother's unsuccessful marriages, the search for the biological father's surrender, the search for dreams, the evolution, stagnation and involution of our characters. The script is not megalomaniac, it is not complex and not full of twists, of course we have many narrative mirrors, and even some easter egg director does, but in essence it is simply portraying the footsteps of a boy, from childhood to youth , Its clarity and simplicity cause perfection in portraying all the subtleties of life, reminiscent of the recent ""Manchester by the sea"", and even the controversial ""Blue is the warmest color"", ""Boyhood"" is almost an epic, an epic Of real life. With a moral that undergoes a message that ""everything has its right time in life"", it is a beautiful message, which the film legitimates, but in a completely natural way, without wishing to lecture or make judgments. With an always clear photograph and simple cameras that simply seek to show the naturalness and beauty of the common, we have a great assembly and an extraordinary pace, its almost 3 hours of duration are more for 20 minutes, alias, it is almost like spying on someone's life For 12 years, I can not fail to mention his well-honed soundtrack, which among many things, help to temporarily mark the timeline of the film, as well as convey feelings, be they the pure adventure climate to melancholy. In terms of acting we have many disasters and performances that are completely lost with the passing of the film, after all, we can not forget that the actors of the work recorded it for twelve years, but we have to mention the actor Ellar Coltrane, who during the twelve years makes An incredible performance (a pity that we will see the actor in his junior phase only in this work), it is worth mentioning also to Etha Hawke that manages to give a perfect evolution to his character but without losing its essence, and of course, I can not finish without speaking of Completely crazy and daring Richard Linklater, who has modeled the film for twelve years, and did a perfect job of directing, showing how simple and yet complicated life is, and how all its phases have an intrinsic beauty. ""Boyhood"" is certainly a unique film, we can not doubt that, it is incredible how Richard masterfully accomplished his goal, and since it is subtle and does not play with the viewer, many characters are evolved in intrinsic ways, with gestures that Are not highlighted on the screen, Richard manages to align the script to the rhythm perfectly and manages to show through his camera the life."
" Overrated, slow, boring film
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,2,"This is a good idea for a film: using the same cast, filming parts each year for twelve years. It won loads of awards, and critics love it - so I was expecting it to be great. I was very disappointed to see that it's slow, boring and far too long."
" A film about life itself – brilliant in its simplicity, simple in its brilliance
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,10,"I've seen many movies in my life, some of them masterful and thoroughly impressive, others less appealing, but none could have prepared me for the unique experience of watching ""Boyhood"" by Richard Linklater. Having seen it, I felt utterly overwhelmed by a torrent of emotions: deep affection for having witnessed so much beauty, sadness that the experience is irrevocably over, a deeper melancholy about the sorrows and hardships that life has in store for everyone, weirdly also lightness and elation. If a movie manages to hit you emotionally from so many different directions, evoking opposite feelings while leaving you in a profound state of reflection, it must be great (and of course I am aware that ""great"" is too small a word here). The most dazzling quality of ""Boyhood"" is its naturalness. The viewer is privy to witness the boy Mason (Ellar Coltrane) grow up to become a timid teenager and from there to see him evolve into a stunningly handsome, reflective and creative young man who has his bit of wisdom to share with all of us. 12 years of bittersweet development, of building up connections and breaking them off, of memorable scenes and unconscious day-to-day routine, of shaping the relationships with the most important persons in your life, these 12 years are fabulously captured in about 160 minutes.In the beginning, it may be irritating to some viewers that nothing ""big"" is happening: no great drama is staged, not the usual sex & violence-crime-story we have grown accustomed to being fed. It shows how Hollywood has shaped our viewing expectations, how we are used to consume clichés and stereotypes. Director Richard Linklater lifts us out of this false film universe and rewards us with real life, compressed ad fast-forwarded. However, that does not mean that the movie feels in any way rushed. We still have enough time to get to know Mason and the people dearest to him; his mother (Patricia Arquette) who undergoes a dramatic transformation from housewife to independent psychology lecturer, his sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater) who has a certain waywardness about her that we also find in Mason and his flippant but affectionate father (Ethan Hawke). The fact that this movie was shot at certain periods over a 12-year- stretch singles it out from all other cinematic attempts at capturing a longer personal development in a 2-3 hour film. This boy Mason is real and when he's a teenager and later a young adult, it's still the same actor and not just someone who resembles the other actor. The 2017 Academy Award winner for Best Movie, ""Moonlight"" tried something similar in portraying the life of a black homosexual from a poor family at the three stages of boyhood, being a teenager and adulthood. Yet, no matter how much the movie was ""on message"", the actors playing the main character Chiron didn't even look alike. Thus, the whole movie didn't feel right. Here, we don't have that problem. All of it feels smooth and natural, which makes it virtually impossible not to empathize with Mason when he encounters the first bumps in his young life, when he suffers under the regime of alcoholic, bad-tempered stepfathers, when he is impeded by self-consciousness and shyness as a teenager, when he asks the big questions as a young adult and desperately seeks answers that provide him with a compass for life. All these experiences are universal, everyone has made them one way or the other and we know that they don't come with cheesy dialog lines out of a 19th century drama.What Linklater had in mind when he embarked on a project of such magnitude that demanded extraordinary discipline and a lot of time, was to capture life in its purest form. This clarity in his ambition pays off multi fold as it allows us to focus entirely on the characters and not be distracted by the often irksome question of which message the director wants to convey with this and that. Moreover, this astonishing film about existence surpasses the existentialist reductionism that many find expressed at its best in Beckett's play ""Waiting for Godot"": there the characters are engulfed in an existence beyond hope, spending their days waiting for someone who never comes. There's a whole array of movies out that transport the same existentialist loneliness and disillusionment (take ""Kids"" or ""Ken Park"") and leave the viewers with a feeling of gloom. By contrast, ""Boyhood"" ends on a decidedly hopeful chord – there is change (for the better) all around us, we just need to allow ourselves to give in to the moment."
" A delightful picture about Mason, a boy attending the whole mandatory school years and related events he will encounter.
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,9,"As brought up in press relieves, this movie was shot during 12 years with the same actors, same cast and of course same director.Richard Linklater is a very respectable filmmaker but a suspicion that this movie could become about a depiction of a social experiment had arise. Right from the beginning this suspicion would fade out because we are watching a real movie, an excellent movie. It is the testimony of a span in a life experience not of Ellar Coltrane who we watch actually growing up but the story of Mason's early years in life. Few movies are so fixated in relating the developing of a character to his social and cultural environs as this is. In spite of an specific historic era individuals passing through elementary, middle and High school are committed sponges to absorb from both the academic and extracurricular modes but also from the subsidiary contacts and influences from parents, family (with many kind of dynamics), neighbors, blockbusters phenomena, meeting other students, bulling, boozing, body adornment, religious and political options, foreign wars and the rhetoric counseling that might or might not stay as a light where to base a happy future life. All these components are present in the movie but not in the sense that a context shaping an archetype representative of an era. Mason meets all these situations not as expected hurdles or lifts but with the naivety of uncertainty. We do not know totally what he is absorbing from these marks. It is a unique story. The acting is exceptional and the script provides a discourse that is real and defines characters naturally and with credibility. Arquette and hawke are wonderful as divorced Mason's parents. She as a single mom is overwhelmed with responsibility and still pushing for doing the right thing for her children. As such human person she is sometimes down. Hawke in the role of the distant parent is also human. We see his encounters with Sam and Mason as separated in time. The lack of continuity in parenting gives him guilt but he externalizes a face and a sound of confidence advising his children. It seems that he believes in his parent's position but he probably is aware of his shortcomings and recognizes his parent's work as not perfect but doing what he could within the given the circumstances. Atmosphere, acting and storytelling haves made this film very enjoyable. Richard Linklater made this movie work by combining the abundant and weighty elements in a chemistry of constrain and intelligence. The parallel growing up of Ellar and Mason was of great benefit for the film. Gave the viewers a knitted sense of History."
" Beautiful film
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,10,"I literally love this film. The sheer love and warmth it made me feel towards the characters is something I haven't felt for a very long time.Linklater is said to talk of the film in very paternal terms, and this is exactly what comes through in his film making. I cared so much for Mason and for his whole family that the time flew by and the only thing I was looking to see as the years passed was that they were all doing well.Other reviews on here say that 'nothing happens'. I cant understand this at all- so much happens! I was so involved in their lives I didn't want it to end.If you like crashes and bangs and bright lights, this film is not for you. If you like to feel something during a movie, I cant recommend this highly enough, especially if you are a parent.(I realize this review is 3 years out of date, but I only saw it on the TV recently and felt so strongly that I needed to post!)."
" Makes you re-live your childhood
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,9,This movie brings back lot of memories from childhood.. Even though I am from India.. I could totally relate to the boy.. Boyhood an awesome feeling. I loved all LinkLaters movie and this my favorite.. The discussion the bay has with his father.. The carefree attitude in teenage.. The first girlfriend.. And most of all the back ground score and the song ..Linklater hit the chords right and everyone can relate to this movie. One of the must watch movies
" The Linklater's best movie
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,10,"Boyhood is how much more true it is seen in American cinema of the last decade. Identify with Mason is simple, especially if you were born in the late 90s, but the story is so well written, the basic idea is so original that it captures all generations. Linklater is brilliant, Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette are perfect parents, the part of Ellar Coltrane is so lukewarm recited to make it more realistic, Boyhood is the definitive introspective journey of the life."
" awful
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,1,"the most disappointing film ever. terrible. not original, whatsoever. It's just sad. so sad., so overrated...... ""doesn't contain a coherent plot so much as a chronological sequence of loosely connected vignettes. There's no thread tying it all together, no central conflict animating the characters."""
" Boyhood
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,9,"Richard Linklater's 'Boyhood' is a brilliant film about life and the struggle to find meaning. It follows a family through a twelve year period as they endure situations and tackle obstacles together. The main technical aspect of the film is a very controversial and memorable one as Linklater hired his main actors and continued to follow them for twelve years thus adding to the realism of the feature adding much poignancy to the themes. The overall direction can be considered very naturalistic and simple but there are wonderful shots of natural environments such as the beautiful river that Mason and his father visit representing the beauty of life whilst underlining the insignificance of man's role in the world.The screenplay is a touching study of the meaning of life. There is a great balance of humour and heart-rending dialogue throughout the film. At 165 minutes, the movie is a long one but the pacing was perfect and captivating that I hardly noted the film's duration. The characters each have profound dialogue in which they discuss the journey of which they (and we) are going through and question the reasoning of difficult events.The performances in 'Boyhood' are exceptional. Mason (Ellar Coltrane) starts off as relatively inexperienced and under-developed but matures as the film progresses adding substance to his character's arch. This performance is supported by the excellent Patricia Arquette who plays the mother. Arquette manages to portray the mother perfectly as she undergoes traumatic events that shape her family's life.Overall, I feel that 'Boyhood' is a technically brilliant achievement in film-making. Not only is the process fascinating in terms of the methods used to create the film but it is also a fascinating investigation into time."
" Unique Approach And An Intriguing Premise
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"Using the revolutionary approach of filming the same actors as they age along with the events of the movie, director Richard Linklater created a 100% unique, authentic film. While that technique could have been used as a ""gimmick"" and nothing more, Linklater is able to back it up with a simple, yet engaging, premise: the life of a child.For a basic plot summary, ""Boyhood"" focuses on the life of Mason (Ellar Coltrane), a boy we see age from grade school years to college during the course of the film. Along the way, the movie focuses on the events that make a life, well, a life. Through family strife (and good times), many moves, and plenty of milestones, viewers are drawn into the life of Mason and how he both affects and is affected by those around him. Other key players in the experience are his sister (Lorelei Linklater), mother (Patricia Arquette), and father (Ethan Hawke).Obviously, ""Boyhood"" got a lot of publicity because of how they basically filmed it over a number of years in ""real time"", if you will, as the characters aged themselves. This gives the film a more authentic feel rather than using makeup or prosthetics to achieve aging. While not all movies are able to use this approach, obviously, it was a perfect choice to tell this type of story, where the journey is just as important as anything else in the picture.In terms of overall story/plot, this is the type of movie that I often struggle with, as it indeed lacks a central event to tell the story around. It literally is ""watching a boy grow up"". A lot of times, I think that could easily get meandering or outright boring, but Linklater manages to succeed because he makes everything feel so authentic. Using real-aged actors was only the first step, with the next being the ability to touch on certain mindsets and milestones in every young person's life. There were times during the viewing when I'd think to myself ""yeah, I remember thinking/doing that"" as a young person, and I think that most people who watch the film will have similar reactions.So, despite no ""hook"" (or at least a much more esoteric one than most films provide) in the traditional sense, ""Boyhood"" manages to succeed wildly because it does what it sets out to so perfectly. If you are intrigued by thinking/concept movies, this one is a must-see."
" An almost good idea
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,3,"Tracking a boys life over 10 years. It's a simple idea, that this film tries to mine for gold.And it almost works. It's obviously a film that engages you, and the music in between gives the audience a sense of time passing in the wider world, not just in the life of the boy.I did find it a little sweary though, and overlong as well. I appreciate that the film makers were trying to be as authentic as possible, but it alienated me as a viewer.It was deserving of awards, but perhaps not all the hype."
" Interesting Film
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,7,"While Boyhood was both new and interesting, the film lacked some key elements that caused it to fall short of the mostly outstanding critic reviews. To begin with, it lacked a constant plot. While the movie's story line was supposed to follow the life of a boy as he grew into an adult, it seemed more like a documentary rather than a movie, as there was no rising action, climax, or resolution, which made the film seem flat, and unexciting. The characters were also strangely difficult to relate to, even though the entire film was meant to document real life struggles and issues, with the main protagonist taking on a quiet and aloof demeanor throughout the majority of the movie, which caused him to feel more like a supporting and static character, rather than a dynamic one, despite his physical changes. After all this though, the movie was definitely groundbreaking, and I give the director and producers props for creating a completely new type of movie."
" Overrated
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,4,I find this movie so damn overrated. Got an Oscar and so many people recommended it to me. The only tag in this movie on IMDb is drama which is accurate since there's no comedy or anything else besides drama and the drama itself isn't even that much While there was drama here and there it wasn't really something that mattered. There were some important moments in the movie which obviously are so important that they should be shown or talked about again but it's just so straight forward. I feel no connection with Mason or the characters really. It's not a feel good story either. Kinda felt like wasting 2 and a half hour.
" Drink some strong coffee before watching
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,5,"""... a scintillating, sizzling explosion of cinematic fireworks; a dazzling, dizzying, break-neck roller coaster ride that leaves you breathless and thunderstruck.""That excerpt from a review would apply to a typical Ingmar Bergman offering when stacked up against Boyhood.Boyhood, of course, is not an action packed film, nor is it an exciting one. It is best described as the work of a great painter. No, not Picasso or Modigliani, but more like Bob from Bob's Painting and Drywall. Bob may do a wonderful job on your walls, but I don't expect you'll want to spend much time sitting in a chair staring at his final product.Yes, this is a well made film, and some of the acting - particularly that of Ethan Hawke - is fine, but what can you say about a movie that serves up such original lines as ""I'm glad you were born"" and ""Don't forget to floss""?I should also mention the performance of Ellar Coltrane who plays the main character Mason. Coltrane's lethargic acting immensely adds to the soporific qualities of this film. He really could have benefited from a few cups of espresso before stepping in front of the camera. In fact, I also recommend a good shot of caffeine for anyone intent on watching this.Writer/director Richard Linklater apparently uses Turtle Pacing Technology, a revolutionary new technique wherein a film that takes twelve years to make somehow also manages to make the audience feel as if they have just spent an equal amount of time in their theater seats.This new technology should have been nominated for a Scientific and Technical Award Oscar. Incidentally, the Academy's Sci-Tech awards are no longer broadcast on television due to the fact that they are ""too exciting"" according to Richard Linklater.So if you are in the mood for cavalierly tossing aside nearly three hours of your adulthood, then by all means have a look at Boyhood."
" Brilliant coming-of-age time lapse journey film
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,8,"Boyhood is a coming-of-age drama film that goes to the length of shooting for over 12 years to achieve what the director, Richard Linklater wants to offer the audience. A tale of a 6-year old boy and his sister's life, as they grow up living door-to-door with their single mother who has been making the worst life decisions when it comes to choosing the kids' father. The real father(played by Ethan Hawke) is on good terms though, as they go with him every other weekend. The story grows along them as they reach adolescence and the changes they have, which is depicted in a very natural way, given the actors have stayed the some over the course of time.The film is surely one of its kind"
" The best film I have ever watched.
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,10,"This film, I know is not for everyone however if it clicks with you it won't just be a small enjoyment, you'll love it. The writing is fantastic and for me anyway I didn't feel like it was long at all, it flowed fantastically and I enjoyed every minute of it. Patricia Arquette is superb along with many other actors including the main man Eltar Coltrane who was brilliant throughout. What makes this film even better is that we see the growth of this man but it is believable and that really helps in making this masterpiece.I fully recommend this film but I do realise that it won't work for everyone, however give it a try and it might just work for you and honestly it is the best film I have ever seen."
