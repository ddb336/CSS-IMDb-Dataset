" I loved it!
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,8,"This was my favorite of all the three. I was finally not distracted by the fact that she was really not fat like real people. It clearly pointed out that she had reached her target weight. Also, her maturity brought with it a sense of acceptance of her life and her choices. I didn't rate it higher due to some of the goofs, her birthday a big one. I felt the Mark Darcy character was better depicted here and that the years that have past have taught him some humanity. The Jack character was a good treat and much more dimension than the Hugh Grant character whose storyline was really overdone. This movie was a good watch if you are a fan of the Bridget Jones story."
" I don't like it
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,1,I don't like it. I think it's a waste of time because the first two movie is beautiful and funny but the third one is wasteful. Doesn't like it
" Bridget Jones's Baby
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,5,"3rd in the popular series, see 40+ Bridget realising time is running out for having a baby. Determined instead to have some fun, she sleeps with both Dempsey and Further and gets pregnant - but which one is the father.Enjoyable slice of wit with Zellwegger on sparkling form with all around her also pulling their weight. The plot around who the father is, is a bit meh and Hugh Grant is conspicuous by his absence, but otherwise it's witty and quite touching."
" I just don't get it? But I love it!
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,8,"I don't normally do spoilers, but I can't hold my WTF in on this one.
I really, really enjoyed the film and it's probably my favourite in the series, having just got a certain something that the others didn't quite have.
However, why the F would you choose to Marry and raise a child with Arsey Darcy (I've really never seen the appeal in Colin or his character here I'm afraid) when the most perfect and Godlike man, in the form of Patrick Dempsey is right there and so obviously more compatible with Bridget than Mark is.
If it was Daniel Cleaver I might understand. I believe this is how it goes in the book, but Hugh wouldn't come back at the time and so had to be replaced with Jack, but you just wouldn't would you, if a quite clearly better option is available!!!
It's not even just because he is gorgeous and adorable to boot, but the character is so charming and has that spontaneous and worldly side that Mark is missing and that Bridget craves, whilst still being a great guy, unlike Daniel would have been. And I understand that there's a history with Mark, but I don't know, it just makes me fuming.The film itself is a great story, full of some great moments and one liners. The soundtrack is superb and Ed Sheeran's cameo will go down in legendary history along with Sir Elton John's in ""Kingsman"".It seems like the director has shaken things up a bit and the writing has given some of the bit parts a chance to shine too, whilst still keeping the focus appropriately on Bridget and the fellas.Emma Thompson does her fantastic thing as always, but don't you think that she always looks a bit sad these days? I think it's because Alan Rickman gave that necklace to that Ho instead of her that one Christmas? I'll never forgive him for that, despite his actions at Hogwarts.I really like the change in Bridget too, I like the fact that she's grown up, but still a bit daft. All of the films have their silly moments and farcical elements, but this one really gets the balance spot on. And I love the moments where she tells someone off, she really gets those right.
I also like the fact that she's not fretting about her appearance as she had been, realising that she was fine ""Just the way she was"".I still don't get the Darcy thing, but I do enjoy watching this one. It's actually quite hilarious."
" Maybe for the fans...
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,4,"Maybe works for the fans, but lame and desperate apart from the few scenes of laugh"
" Atrocious
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,1,"I wasn't expecting much, as I wasn't a fan of even the first film. None of this film is remotely believeable, and is an insult to the intelligence. Hard to know whwere to start, but the eponymous heroine is the best place I suppose. Every now and then the plastic surgery and make up cracks and you see how old Bridget Jones looks. She's supposed to be 43, yet she gets pregnant after just two sexual encounters with different men. In reality she looks about 55 - if anything the plastic surgery has aged her, as well as making her look like an alien. There is zero chance that either of her desperate suitors would go for her, especially given her loose morals, foul language, tired old jokes, and pathetic hangers on.
Even Paul McCartney would have drawn the line at this one, and there aren't too many rich men quite as stupid as Paul. Even Paul isn't that stupid these days.
Give this one a miss. Tedious retread of a worn out series. Embarrassing. I can see why Hugh Grant gave it a miss. Very wise, I wished I'd followed his example."
" Funny and dramatic enough
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,6,"It rivets you till the end. This is a story of a somewhat easy woman in terma of sex who becomes pregnant without knowing who is the father between two very different men (one a dignified aristocratic barrister and the other a much more relaxed technician). This suspense all the movie along is well performed by the actress who does Bridget (Rn√©e Zellveger) who besides being a beautiful woman does an excellent job in terms os words, deeds, smiles, laughing and the facial expressions. And the love triangle develops itself in several unexpected turns.
Although not exactly a masterpiece (the story is too simple to allow that) this movie can entertain reasonably you till the end."
" Utter boredom
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,2,"Over 90% of the movies that I watch are horror so as a rule romantic comedies aren't really my cup of tea. However,I really enjoyed the first Bridget Jones movie, the second was so so. Naturally I was curious about this, the third entry.
At the age of 43 Bridget gets pregnant, but she's not sure who the father is, he could be either her ex Mark Darcy, or he could be an American billionaire. Personally I didn't care who he is, this movie is so incredibly slow and unfunny, I just about hung on until the end credits. I found it sad that a film resorts to swearing in attempt to be funny. It's not. Only positive thing was the soundtrack. Oh, and Bridget's more slender figure. Two hours of utter boredom."
" Irresistably a feel good movie at the end, despite the middle.
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,7,"Bridget Jones's Baby represents an alternative timeline from the one provided by the novel Mad About the Boy, and it starts off very strong, no plot wallowing, even though Bridget is wallowing in the opening scene. This plot instead seems to begin with the timeline hinted at by the 2006 diary continuations published in the Independent, in which Bridget accidentally slept with both Darcy and Daniel and got pregnant by one of them. Except, instead of the baby turning out to be Daniel's but raised by Darcy as in the column, Bridget has a short but memorable affair with an internet billionaire she meets at a music festival (played by Patrick Dempsey), and it's heavily implied by the end that the baby is Darcy's, although it's entirely possible that Jack, the invention created to fill the Daniel-sized hole in this movie, manfully stood aside and gave up any claim he might have had over the child when it became obvious that Bridget was still hung up on Mr. Darcy. Dempsey is as handsome and charming as ever and quite likeable as a well-meaning man who finds more personal meaning in numbers that he can quantify than in people which he can't (hence the name, probably) but it's still hard to ignore the feeling that his role was probably originally written as Daniel's. Maybe Hugh Grant couldn't do it but it seems apparent that it started out as him, and then the scriptwriters had to doctor it up and added in jokes to make the new man less Danielesque. It's still quite funny and charming, just not as much as it would have been had Daniel been the other man. Luckily Zellweger and Firth still have wonderful chemistry and the characters are still perfect for each other, their individual dorkiness balancing each other out marvelously. Their love story pretty much saves the picture from getting bogged down in klutz jokes in the middle. Their happy ending is so happy it nearly erases the awkwardness of some jokes from that long middle section that just didn't land (never in my life have I been so strongly reminded that Gen X is way bigger and more influential in other countries than in the USA than when watching this British movie) Emma Thompson also shows up as Bridget's OBGYN and to steal the picture out from under any of her scene partners. Will I watch again? Yes, but I'll fast forward through the middle third."
" big no no for me
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,1,Whitewashed and full of superficial stereotypes.. what did I just watch?!
" Interesting continuation of the Bridget franchise
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,6,"Quite entertaining rom-com, third instalment in the Bridget Jones Diary franchise with a few twists that make it a better film than the second really.The odious Hugh Grant character, Daniel 'Vivian' Cleaver (Yes you read that right) does not appear in this instalment and his disappearance from this film is explained away pretty well. An apparent death although a body has not been recovered. Is he dead?Bridget Jones (Rene Zellwegger) is still a single, forty something (43 To be precise) who somehow falls pregnant with two possible fathers. (New character, US dating algorithm billionaire guru Jack Quant (Patrick Dempsey) and series regular Mark Darcy (Colin Firth)).The film follows the pregnancy from the first scan to the waters breaking with some hilarious scenes. Jones (as Daniel Cleaver would say) eventually marries but to whom? I won't give that away.There's also a twist towards the end of the film. Is Cleaver still alive? Open for a continuation of the series perhaps. All in all an entertaining, comedic film."
" Yesss
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,10,Woah the best one yet. I'm glad they didn't listen to me when I said not to make a third. I guess I'm not much of a film critic.
" dear, don't lose heart.
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,7,"Fifteen years! How many romantic comedies can last 15 years and be so popular? The heroine is radiant, and the sense of humor is natural. The smile is quick and accurate. The old singles and contemporary elements are playing a new height."
" Sweet, funny, Bridget grows up at last
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,7,"Bridget Jones is now a single 40 something news producer. The job is going well, she has a great apartment, good friends and has finally lost the weight she's struggled with over past movies when she discovers that she's pregnant. In true Bridget fashion she isn't quite sure who the baby's father is though; Mark Darcy who she bumped into at a christening a few weeks back or the random ""McDreamy"" American she hooked up with at a music festival.I enjoyed this a lot, its very sweet and in tune with the other movies in the series even though some of the gags/comedy is a bit lukewarm its still entertaining. It was also nice to see that Bridget had matured, and wasn't quite the goofball as previous films I adored Colin firth as potential dad #1 and good choice in adding Patrick Dempsey to the cast as possible dad #2, the two men together are very funny. I honestly didn't know who the father was going to be until the very end. Emma Thompson is excellent and hilarious as the OBGYN. Nice to see the whole cast back for this final instalment including Bridget's Mum and Dad and assorted friends."
" 'Is you is or is you ain't my baby?'
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,3,"A situation familiar to Mr C Firth from the equally turgid 'Mamma Mia' of blessed memory(comparatively speaking).
Is he the father of Ms Jones's brat?Frankly do we give a damn?
The usual appalling cliches and ham acting with Mr J.Broadbent looking suitably ashamed at dishing out so much old rope.
Lots of swearing from Miss Zellweger and her potty - mouthed chums which doesn't amount to a hill of beans.
I ask myself how much longer this franchise can limp along and I am not confident of a good outcome in this regard.
By the time Bridget Jones's infant gets to Cambridge(naturally),it's mother will be drawing her enhanced pension and still making cow - eyes at Hugh Grant.
You can take that to the bank."
" Absurd ""Comedy""
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,3,"(1st ever movie review.)I absolutely loved the 1st BJD, even though there're short snippets of stupidity, as opposed to sincere humor, in it. Cannot imagine why someone thought it was a good idea to try and make a baby comedy based around a despicable, middle-aged skank. There's absolutely nothing funny about a woman not being forthcoming and honest with 2 possible fathers. The absurdity that an attractive billionaire would carry on as was portrayed in the movie is unbearable. Humor doesn't have to be an insult to one's intelligence.(I walked for hours while in labor.) I just realized, the intent must have been a comedic fantasy film. Nothing is realistic, a lot of the scenes are stupid, and the bits that actually made me chuckle were few and too far between. BOMB!"
" Waited too long
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,7,It would have been better if they made this sooner. Some funny moments but sometimes jarring to watch.
" Awful
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,1,Awful characters dredged up again for more of the same. Script diabolical with constant swearing in lieu of any actual jokes.
" 7/10
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,7,Would have been a 10/10 if Jack is whom Bridget chooses in the end. I like Mark but it has been 10 years....a girl gotta move on!
" Didnt live upto the standard of first two movies
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,5,Not the same without daniel creager..would havw been much entertainnig if he were in it
" Lovely addition to Bridget Jones
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,9,"I found the third movie to be a lovely addition to the franchise of Bridget Jones. I found it quite comparable to the first two. The laughs hit, the characters just as messed up as usual, and the new additions bring a youthful element. Quite enjoyed her antics, as usual, as she navigates her numerous dilemmas. Was a bit annoyed by mark darcy but he plays the character he always did, aloof and a bit standoffish, but wouldn't want him any other way. I would have liked a bit longer of a review to bridge the gap between this and last movie. But overall, it was what they all are, mindlessly entertaining. Don't go looking for an Oscar worthy performance, that isn't the intent. It's a romcom."
" Swearing Females
",2019-08-23 00:00:00,1,"If you find women swearing and using foul language funny, you will laugh hysterically. If you are seeking a witty, well written and funny film. you will get more laughs in War and Peace and BJB feels as long as that seven hour epic. I assume that Hollywood's obsession with 'strong women' resulted in the 'writers' deciding that foul mouthed women would be men's equals, nay superiors. Who needs humor when you have political correctness? I smiled once, but that was in relief that this boring garbage finally ended."
" A sequel too far.
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,4,"Part of the charm of the oringinal films and source novel, is that Bridget Jones is insecure and struggles with her weight. In this film, Bridget is her ""ideal weight.' To cut a long story short, the character of Bridget Jones has been ruined. Partly because Renee Zellweger's appearance has altered so much.
To be honest, I could only sit through the first 10 minutes of this film, it was not a good idea to make another one."
" I miss the old Bridget
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,2,"Honestly, this movie is just awful. I want the old Bridget Jones back, not this fancy, skinny, popular, upper middle class, cliche, boring woman. A waste of an hour and a half, which is all I gave it."
" Very funny, better than the 1. Movie
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,8,"Yes, it's very funny, i laughed very often while i was watching this movie. It's better than the 1. movie. Pretty good."
" Totally cut me off
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,4,"Anyways, as I was saying..she then was suddenly all about Darcy once again.. Not only does that show a lack of strength on her end, it shows that when it comes to taking the best route with a man she actually loved and could have been with until trying to make Jack this terrible being because Darcy threw a tantrum.. she gave up and just ran back to him.. This just wreaks havoc upon any feminist around the world, and is not exactly something Id want my daughter growing up seeing.. Just the idea that you should allow a man to walk all over you, ignore you, completely throw you under the bus the minute rocky water comes forth, only to then end up with him again? When there is a better option available? It's just wrong. I personally was going to give it three starts but felt I should in fact give credit where due because the story line was good, and the humor in it was as well. Overall I was not exactly happy, and the whole getting back with her ex after he clearly showed where he stood in terms of her, work and the baby, just seems wrong to me."
" Good but the ending should have been different
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,4,"I really liked this movie overall. I found it funny, and still relevant in some aspect to the first one. The only thing I disliked about this movie was the ending.SPOILERS: If you have not seen it yet, I would stop reading. Personally, the person she ended up with was wrong, Although her and Mark have a major history, its simply that.. History. One thing I dislike about a lot of movies that are portrayed is the concept of bringing old flames back together. When in fact, doing so isn't always the best resolution. Jack himself was a way better candidate to not only be the father of the child, but to be a husband to Bridget.. It's clear that Mark values work over her. And it's also clear that in the past they had an array of issues with trying to make it work as a couple.. Like his product of putting work first hasn't exactly changed.Therefore his ability to be involved with the child at all is slim to none, and not only that but now that child will grow up with that mindset of putting work first. And I just think that's wrong. Not only that, but throughout the whole pregnancy he wasn't even present. At first he was all about it, but the minute they ran into any product of ""rocky roads"" he ran. He would dissapear and entirely close himself off of being involved with Bridget or the progression through her pregnancy. Like why would you want someone like that? It's funny to because it's kind of all over the place with where bridget lies. First the idea of being with Darcy was totally not in the books, then the minute that possibility of he could be the dad comes forth and suddenly her perception of him has changed? She expressed earlier in the film that ""she was falling"" for Jack but the minute Darcy had a temper tantrum and cut them off entirely she was just sudden"
" Jonesing for another movie
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Patrick Dempsy was a great add. The best one so far.
Hope they make another!"
" Only if you're a insanely hardcore Bridget fan
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,3,"Let's start with the positive: Emma Thompson is great!Now that we've got the positive out the way, let's stick to the horrible script and plod on. Bridget Jones's Diary was a great movie and they should've stopped there. But money trumps common sense and here we have the (hopefully) last addition.To summarise how this movie made me feel; like the director desperately wanted to appeal to a younger audience while alienating anyone who was endeared by Bridget her first story. The soundtrack is godawful, Ed Sheeran seems to be forced into this mess, the jokes are predictable and the script itself is so awful, even Colin Firth can't save this one.The difference in pacing, jokes and just overall feel is staggeringly dreadful and made it hard to actually finish watching this movie.So if you just pressed play, please stop and just rewatch the first movie. It'll keep the good memories unspoilt."
" Absolutely horrific!
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,2,"Not funny! Not sharp. Not Rene Zellweger. What has she done to her face? How can she actually do THAT much plastic surgery? She was beautiful (so were Meg Ryan AND Helen Hunt before they messed with their mugs!!!I couldn't even watch a few minutes of it, as she tells two men that she is pregnant and has no idea who's the daddy, in her Bridget Jones rambling way, which is not funny anymore. And it's a shame. Because the first movie was fresh, different, sharp, and genuinely ground breaking. This? No."
" An undemanding bit of fun
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,6,"Bridget Jones's Baby. Ridiculous, at times annoying, some chuckles but few laugh out loud moments. An undemanding watch though and was never bored. Not a touch on the original but far better than the debacle that was edge of reason. 6 out of ten"
" It was actually okay?
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,8,"I mean, the movie is not great or anything, but I liked it, and i have a feeling that others will too."
" Darcy Baby
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,10,10/10 just because Darcy ended up being the dad :)
" Great movie. Amazing movie.
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,10,I have always loved Patrick Dempsey. Now I love Colin Firth more. This is a great movie. I olny recently watched all 3 movies. They are hilarious. It touches on what a women goes through as someone who is single and pregnant. I am glad that they picked the ending that they did. Not sure if I would have liked it as much if he didn't turn out to be the father. Glad that everyone put aside their differences and all worked together. Love it love it love it.
" NOT ANOTHER ONE...!
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,1,"Bridget Jones' Baby is more of the same in Bridget Jones' cinematic journey into her lovelife. A little better than Edge of Reason, but not much, Baby reunites most of the original cast expect for Hugh Grant who is sorely missed & given a possibility of return by film's end but at this point do we even care? Bridget Jones has gone from a character in control of her destiny to someone whose whims are determined by others as evidenced in the two follow-ups. A shame really..."
" Funny like Bridget
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,6,"I did like many gags that were hilarious, some less so. I found the film storyline rather predictable but tagged along for the good jokes. The last third was getting much less funny, more predictable but it needed to wrap up somehow."
" Good Luck To This Baby
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,3,"I hardly know where to begin to write a review of this film. To me this film fell short on so many levels that I cannot help but conclude that even the writers and craftspeople who worked on it didn't really care about it. I mean really care about it. I think the original was such a big hit that they all just went through the motions here hoping for a 'goodwill' paycheck. Therefor I refuse to spend for time on this review than the artists did on this project. As such I will just say that the script was extremely cliched, misogynistic, predictable, and dated."
" Hilarious!!!
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,10,First movie was funny - second movie kind of boring - third movie So freaking funny!Loved it! So hilarious! Tears from laughing! She did it again! Must-see!
" Tasteless
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,1,"No movie should get a rating higher than 1 star, that makes a joke about genocide. It's neither smart, neither funny, it's just completely tasteless and awkward. I for one certainly don't believe, that movies necessarily need to have a positive message, but laughing over genocide is just too awful to appreciate anything else that this movie might offers."
" Wasting of time and energy watching this movie
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,1,"Nothing to enjoy about this movie, boring, predictable and cliche. Most of all, so unreal. Renee looks so different in this movie, old and had plastic surgery I suppose? Her voice, or the fake British accent sounds so phony. The first one was enjoyable, even though the story also unreal but more of a romantic fantasy for women, but at least it was funny and entertaining. This one is just so much more worse."
" Pure Rot
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,1,"Why in the wide wide world of sports did they make this? Hugh Grange of ret wisely left this project, as he 'disliked the script'. Emma Thompson was a co-writer, so perhaps that is a clue as to why this is such a horrible dud. The miscasting of Patrick Dempsey merely ensured this would flop.The 'Edge of Reason' pushed it a bit too far, but this was an uncalled for piece of rot that is barely coherent and full of very very bad performances.It's difficult now to watch either Colin Firth or Renee Zellweger in anything after seeing this, but its always been difficult to watch Patrick Dempsey.God help us if they let these people make another movie."
" Apple has gone too far
",2018-01-10 00:00:00,3,"This time Apple really went too far. Up until now the worst was the scene in Silver Linings Playbook where Julia Stiles' character utters ""You don't have an iPod? Who doesn't have an iPod??"" but this is a hundred times worse. There's hardly a scene in the first half of the movie where we don't see the logo. You actually forget you're watching a movie. It borders on farce when Bridget is holding her phone and adjusts her fingers so that you can see the Apple logo from between her fingers. Google have their bit too, but smaller. I get it, Apple own Hollywood so modern movies happen in this alternate universe where not only everyone's area code is 555 but everyone uses Apple products. Kind of like Acme in the cartoons. But isn't product placement supposed to be subtle and work subconsciously, rather than be shoved down our throats all the time?What about the rest of the movie? I remembered Bridget being a nice and kind person. Here she comes out as selfish, inconsiderate and unlikeable. The story is uninteresting. I didn't even care what happens in the end. I found Patrick Dempsey's character annoying. Sarah Solemani and Kate O'Flynn have some semi-funny moments. Colin Firth is the same as usual. I give it a three."
" Terrible
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,1,Absolutely awful. Wrong ending. Wrong guy. Absolutely awful. Wrong ending. Wrong guy. Absolutely awful. Wrong ending. Wrong guy. Absolutely awful. Wrong ending. Wrong guy. Absolutely awful. Wrong ending. Wrong guy.Absolutely awful. Wrong ending. Wrong guy.Absolutely awful. Wrong ending. Wrong guy.
" It's the guy from Starbucks
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,8,"Bridget (Ren√©e Zellweger) is a 43 year old news producer...spinster. She has retired her ovaries. Daniel, one of the two loves of her life, has passed on. She asks herself in Austen fashion, ""Is Mr. Darcy, Mr Right?"" She goes away on to a music festival (one that has Ed Sheeran). It is called a ""Sodom and Gomorrah with tofu."" Here she meets Jack (Patrick Dempsey) and hooks up. Later at home, her and Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) a married man, come together after 10 years of cat and mouse. As you already know, the question becomes, ""whose baby is it?"" The film is a romantic comedy, with Bridget loved unconditionally by two wealthy men, apparently not uncommon for 43 year old pregnant moms who don't know who is the father. The support cast was excellent and the film boasts a Joe Cocker, ""Up Where We Belong"" moment...sort of. We don't get to know who the father is until the very end...This was a fairly good comedy with top stars up grading what could have been an average film.Guide: F-word. Sex. Male rear nudity...and not pretty at that."
" Light and fun
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,8,"If you want to see a movie that is both light, and fun, this is the movie to watch. Ren√©e Zellweger did an incredible job with her British accent, from an American point of view. I enjoyed the nuances of work life, and personal life, including the latest technology. I don't normally watch movies of this type, but decided to try it as the trailer looked appealing. Colin Firth, Patrick Dempsey, Gemma Jones, and Emma Thompson were a great combination of characters for this particular show."
" Bridget Jones herself is an overgrown child!
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,5,"People who think 'use-by-dates' on condoms don't mean anything are why we have a population problem!In the past, it was easy enough to cheer for Bridget, because she was positioned as the 'plucky underdog' - but I don't ever remember her being as dumb as in her first visit to the doctor's office... If you're 43 and you don't understand the finer points of conception (or how foetal alcohol syndrome works, for that matter), you're less of an underdog, and more of a simpleton! No wonder the biggest comedic weapon that Emma Thompson employs here is to roll her eyes... she's mirroring what the reaction of every right-thinking audience member should be.It's strange when Richard Curtis writes Bridget better for the screen than her own creator does!Having said all of this in criticism, if you treasure Bridget Jones as a character, then I don't think any of this will bother you. She has to work harder to win my sympathy, though, and this time - in contrast to the previous two films - she didn't get much of it."
" Not that much of an improvement
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,5,"'Bridget Jones's Diary' was an immensely enjoyable film. It had a lot going for it, and succeeded on almost every level. It didn't cover much new ground and didn't break any conventions, but it was warm, charming, hugely funny and sometimes poignant, with a great cast. 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason' was however a big step down, despite being adeptly played it lost a lot of what made 'Bridget Jones's' Diary so good.Heard a lot of different opinions on 'Bridget Jones's' Baby. Some people said that it was a return to form and a huge improvement over 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason'. Others said that it was worse and had no point to it. Having seen it myself, initially worried but really wanting to like it and judge it as mindless entertainment, to me it was an improvement but not by much. Not a return to form and nowhere near as good as 'Bridget Jones's Diary'. There are things that are done better here, but there are also the same mistakes and also a few different ones.It has its good points certainly. 'Bridget Jones's Baby' looks good, being mostly attractive visually in a film that doesn't require epic sweeping cinematography or opulence while still being beautifully shot and with striking locations.Again, like the previous two films, 'Bridget Jones's' Baby' is adeptly played. Renee Zellwegger, whose Bridget is nowhere near as much a parody or the butt of the joke like in 'Edge of Reason', overdoes it in the facial expressions (on a side note, and no shallowness intended, the Botox does not help), but really attempts and succeeds at bringing out the great qualities of her acting in the previous two films, trying to bring out the funny, adorably awkward and sympathetic sides of her character when the material allows it and her accent more than game.Colin Firth is sophisticated, understated and charmingly stoic. Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent seem incapable of giving bad performances, though they did deserve more to do, while Sarah Solemani brings an enjoyable amount of sauciness. The casting highlight however is Emma Thompson, who is a hoot and is a breath of fresh air with the funniest material. On that note, there are more amusing moments here than there were in 'Edge of Reason', Thompson's material mostly but also the reason for Hugh Grant's absence and Ed Sheeran. The soundtrack is more appealing this time round with better choice of songs.For all those good things, the story is even more contrived and predictable than 'Edge of Reason', and, apart from a few good moments, too much of the writing and gags are tired, recycled and even more stale, freshness was sorely lacking here. The romantic elements are lacking in heart and warmth and, despite a subject that so many people would relate to, 'Bridget Jones's Baby' does little with the subject and offers nothing illuminating.Some of the subplots are strange and clumsily used, especially the one dealing with the punk rock, which didn't seem to fit. Patrick Dempsey is a comparatively fairly weak and mediocre at best substitute for the much missed Hugh Grant (who excelled so well at playing against type previously), having much less of his charm and charisma and instead coming off as both bland and annoying.While the songs themselves are good, the placement for some isn't, with some misplaced randomness going on. Sharon Maguire's direction is more competent here but is still uninspired, while there is some amateurish editing and obvious, cheap use of green screen.Overall, not awful but a disappointment and should have been so much better. Instead of laughing consistently, being touched or oohing and ahhing, found myself questioning 'Bridget Jones's Baby's' necessity and thinking ""so what?"". 5/10 Bethany Cox"
" was not necessary to make this movie
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,1,"The first time, it was cute.The 2nd time, not so cute. This time, a disaster.Leave Well Enough Alone!Whoever cast Patrick Dempsey is just plain stupid! He fits this movie like two left shoes And Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent-good grief don't these people ever just go away?As for Mr. Firth, he has just one expression-VSO (Very Seriously Old)"
" Exactly what I expected
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,7,"I've had a rough few days and wanted mindless entertainment. This movie was cute, entertaining AND predictable. I have always enjoyed the 'Bridget' movies. There were NO surprises. And that was just fine. I feel like, if I had gone to the theater to see this and been disappointed it would have been my own fault because this movie was very similar to earlier movies. I wasn't sure who to route for - American Jack or Mark Darcy. I thought either would have made a good dad. I think Renee (as Bridget) looks better as she has aged (Thank you LORD - often men age well in movies and women don't by design it seems like!). In one review the writer was appalled that they didn't make Bridget have amnio. Let me just put a plug out there for the opposite point of view! They offered it to her, told her the risks and she didn't do it! I didn't either! This is a matter of personal preference. There is a risk with this procedure! All in all, an enjoyable movie!"
" some good Bridget Jones fun
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,7,"Bridget Jones (Ren√©e Zellweger) comes to terms with her 43rd birthday and her permanent childless single status. Bridget attends Daniel Cleaver's funeral after his disappearance. Surprisingly, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) shows up with his wife. Everybody is married with children, even the gays. Bridget is dragged to a music festival by best friend Miranda (Sarah Solemani). She sleeps with Jack Qwant (Patrick Dempsey), the first guy she meets, who turns out to be an internet dating billionaire. Later at a christening, she hooks up with fellow godparent Mark Darcy who claims to be getting a divorce. She has a surprise pregnancy and the father could be either man.This has plenty of single Bridget Jones fun. I'm glad that Zellweger gave up getting bigger to do a bunch of fat jokes. It's not breaking any new grounds but it is fun for fans. Emma Thompson has fun being the doctor. It's a comedy and I laughed a couple of times."
" Couldn't Finish It
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,1,"There is, indeed, something wrong with Zellweger's face job. The stretched eyes, the botoxed forehead, the puffed out lips - made a joke out of the Bridget Jones character. And the British accent - by now wouldn't it be MORE believable after the third outing instead of something from a high school drama class? Zellweger's scrunched up facial expressions have become identical - pain, thinking, happy all look the same. The premise of the movie - that a 43-year-old woman can't tell who fathered her child - is painfully stupid."
" Bridget is back
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,7,"Frist, Bridget Jones is back!! And no, this movie is no based in the third book os the saga, it's something completely different and 100% original, no based in any book.Second, chick flicks are no longer welcomed in the market but this is not one of those soapy movies. This is Bridget Jones who comes back as she always does, making us laugh about the situations she finds herself in and reminding all of us that she is human too, which allows her to come nearer to the audience.Third, out of the three movies this is the one were I laughed the most, because that is why you go watch this movie, to laugh and forget about the rest and it passes the test way ahead.Four, we get to see Bridget and Mr. Darcy again!! Both are played again by Ren√©e and Colin and as always, they have good chemistry on- screen and it doesn't feel like fifteen years have passed since the previous movie. Plus, there is Patrick playing McDreamy, er, I mean a new love interest and of course, he is flawless playing him.Fifth, everybody is back! Bridget's old friends. Bridget's parents. Bridget's new friends at work, who are younger than her and it is a good point to see the generation difference, which means, funnier situations. And then, there is Emma Thompson, who plays Bridget's doctor and every time she is on-screen (sorry there) she steals the show. You cannot stop laughing with her dialogues.If you want to have a great time, laugh and think about live itself, go watch it. Yes, it's more a movie for women than for men but both can enjoy it fully."
" It's British.....so its god-awful
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,1,"Hate this movie. How dare it steal my life, time and money.I really liked the actors but the writers and director are hacks and are squarely the blame. Sharon Maguire and Helen Fielding are horrid: truly.This pile of cellophane hit it's mark on opening week-end...its target market saw it and that was the end of that.Sorry but the British culture and language really is insufferably bad and 50 years of trying to understand British humor is a useless excise.Being a British woman's movie aside, Ren√©e Zellweger was lovely as always and the men in the movie were simply left with little to say or do; it's a criminally bad deal for all the men characters, sorry to say. It might of helped the movie but I question that. Its very hard to come up with a worse movie to compare it with...so I gave up; I hated this movie and mad I paid money and my time to witness it."
" Waste of Time
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,3,"I thought the first Bridget Jones movie was cute enough (barely) and expected pretty much this issue to be along the same lines but quickly found it to be unnecessarily vulgar and profane. I'm fine with the use of 4-letter words when they're motivated by the character and/or plot, however, the foul language in BJB is gratuitous, ridiculous, and distracting. And I haven't even gotten to the plot or acting yet! BJB is supposed to be a comedy but I didn't chuckle during the whole film. Renee Zellweger needs the right vehicle to display her talents and I don't think the BJ movies do her that service. Her co-stars are more than capable to carry the movie, assuming they are served with a reasonable story. Also, I think BJB story line misses Hugh Grant's character and the way the writers made his convenient death at the beginning of the movie is a little silly and contrived. All-in-all, BJB was a disappointment and it didn't need to be."
" Great fun! Lots of giggles
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,7,"I read the first two Bridget Jones books and found they were a lot of fun. I liked the first movie, the second was just ""okay"", but Bridget Jones' baby is back to form, finding Bridget a bit older, skinnier, and no less the bumbling awkward mess she always was. I enjoyed this movie for what it was, a romantic comedy that uses established or wealthy men as romantic leads. And a strong case of opposites attract. This is standard romance fare for women, and if you can't accept that, don't watch romantic comedies.I was disappointed about Daniel's fate, and then disappointed about his reversed fate at the end (but intrigued nonetheless). I dislike tricks in movies and books, as it leads me to feel like I can't trust what I see or read. There was another trick, I won't mention as it would spoil the entire movie.Overall, this was a fun, energetic, female romance fantasy with a less than PERFECT heroine which makes her all the more endearing, and Renee Zellwegger who plays our Bridget with aplomb! I've always liked her, so it was great to see her again. And of course, Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, the stoic misunderstood male lead, and his handsome less-than-honorable billionaire rival played by Patrick Dempsey.Leave your thinking cap at home, and bring your silly pants."
" Greatp
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,10,With this movie we get a since of closers you did not with the last one and adding a baby in always makes things alittle bette. Bridget has grown I mean it's been years since the first movie has come out. We now find one character is no longer in the movie and Ben replaced with a much better looking and younger fella. And there is familiar faces as well. I loved this one just as much if not more than the first 2.
" Welcome back, Bridget
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,5,"After the so-so first sequel I think many people went into this third instalment with some doubts. Especially when you learnt that Richard Curtis was off script writing duties and Hugh Grant declined to return.However, first film Director Sharon Maguire being back was a plus, as was the ever welcome inclusion of Emma Thompson as both an actor and co-writer.So, what of the film itself? In many ways its a case of same old Bridget, only older and more at a loss. Still stuck between two men and in this case stuck as to who is the father.Yes, there's a fair bit of swearing in this film, and it's slightly too long, but it's fun entertainment, and isn't that what the world needs right now? It has some fun moments, and nicely we sort of root for both men to be the Dad.It's a shame they couldn't leave it as a trilogy, but the final few seconds leave the door open for more. After the previously mentioned so-so 'Edge of Reason' it's nice to see Miss Jones back on form."
" Offensively boring: quit while you're behind
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,2,"Clocking in at over two hours (!!), this tired extension of the otherwise charming (if ultimately predictable) Bridget Jones series is an exercise in dumbing down and cashing in. I could go on forever, but then it would be as though I were mimicking the film's protracted length, so I'll leave it at these salient points:* So. Much. Product. Placement.* The word ""f**k"" is not inherently funny. Nor is it edgy, at least not any more. And having a kid scream it in a scene in a church? Anti-funny.* Renee Zellweger's well deserved plaudits for a credible middle-class English accent have gone to her head, her eyes, her cheekbones, etc. It's just way overdone now.* The ""Jack"" character is completely unbelievable in his being entranced by Bridget, thus rendering the plot more or less beyond realistic.There's a cliffhanger at the end, suggesting that this story will go on. Please, God, make it stop."
" Couldn't Even Finish It
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,3,"The first Bridget Jones was a cultural event, one of the movies that defined the times it was released in. The second one was uneven, but had its moments. With this installment, I just didn't care about anything that happened. They lost my interest from the opening moments by having Bridget in the exact same situation we see her in the beginning of the first movie. I would have liked this story to cover some new ground, because I do like the character. Unfortunately, it's just another 90 minutes of keeping Mark Darcy just out of reach until they predictably end up together for the THIRD time."
" It is an amazing film!
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,10,I had never seen any of the Bridget Jones movies before I watched this one and I'm not a romantic comedy sort of person but this film is amazing! Renee Zellweger is such a talented actress and suits this role very well. It is a really funny film as well. I have now seen the other two films and this one is definitely my favourite. *SPOILER* I thought the ending of the film was the best ending. I would of been disappointed if she didn't marry Mark Darcy because he has loved her from the start. Also we discovered that Daniel Cleaver is alive which could mean there might be another film one day. I absolutely adore the Bridget Jones films now and I really hope there will be another movie one day!
" Crude, vulgar, offensive, etc
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,1,"Where to start, even the premise of this plot is offensive and off- putting. And much of the writing is equally crude and vulgar. Definitely not funny and often left me squirming in my seat; what were the writers and producers thinking. Oh wait, I know, money and profits, a paycheck for everyone; let's capitalize on Bridget Jones, a known money maker. Well, greed has finally killed the goose for me regarding future Bridget Jones films. They should all, including the actors and crew, be embarrassed about being part of this god awful mess. Glad to see that Hugh Grant had the good sense to opt out of this one. And I'm surprised to see Emma Thompson's name associated with this classless screenplay."
" i love it
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,"On her 43rd birthday, Bridget Jones is awoken by her mother who reminds her that her time to have children is running out.

Mark Darcy is upset and walks out of the restaurant."
" I've never been so happy to see the credits on a Bridget Jones' film!
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,5,"I may have over exaggerated haha, but seriously though when I saw the credits I was relieved it was over! I liked how the cast from the original films were still there like her parents, her friends, Mark and the reference to Daniel. But I just feel with the absence of Hugh Grant, it just didn't work. Her new friend at the news station, already forgot her name, annoyed me during the music festival scenes because it was just over-acting. When Ed Sheeran was on screen I just found both her's and Bridget's reactions unbelievable. I also wasn't a big fan of the soundtrack, it was too clubby, modern. I mean, I myself am a teenager but I'm used to Bridget Jones with the big power ballads not clubby music that just doesn't express any emotion or even suit the scene. In addition, i did find it hard to warm to Bridget for the first 30 minutes. It's just Renee looks so different with all her plastic surgery, still beautiful but she just didn't resemble the Bridget we've come to love. So it was difficult to view her as the character we know for a while.However, apart from all of this I think it was an uplifting film! I didn't feel like it was depressing or anything, and there were funny moments! It was a feel-good one and although the situation with the pregnancy was a bit odd and in some cases, relatable to some people, they still made it lighthearted which was lovely to see! And it was great to see how happy Bridget was when, although struggling with relationships over the films, she was finally in a position where she wouldn't be alone and that she will have a child to love for the rest of her life."
" Actually offensive.
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,2,"The fact that I actually managed to finish this is a true testament to my Firth devotion. I mean... I seriously have to adore the guy if I'm willing to spend two hours of excruciating viewing torture just so I can be in his filmic company while he wanders around with a bored look on his face, undoubtedly pondering his poor career choices.However, in an effort to be positive, I will avoid ranting about the overall ridiculousness of this implausible story and, instead, simply leave you with the only good point I could find.Yes, the ending makes it clear that they're keeping the path open for a continuation of the torment but, at least for the time being, Hugh Grant sure did dodge a bullet with this one."
" Loved It!
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely loved Bridget Jones's Baby! I was afraid that after all this time, the humor of the previous films (especially the first one) would be lost. I was very pleasantly surprised! My husband, who never cared for romantic comedies, actually watched the entire movie and laughed most of the way through. It is great to see Bridget at a later stage of her life. ( as well as the other characters... Mark Darcy,Jade, etc.) I would highly recommend it to any ""true"" Bridget fan. I also agree with some others that Emma Thompson was a great addition to the cast. I just bought the DVD and have already watched it again. It is great to see a sequel and not be disappointed!"
" I loved this movie
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"I was so excited when I found out this movie was coming out because I fell in love with the first two, they were and still are my favorite movies. I went to IMDb to read the reviews and was absolutely shocked to see all the bad reviews. First of all of course when I saw that jack was the new man in her life I was a little disappointed but really who expected Daniel Clever to be ready to settle down and have children. Surprisingly the conflict between the two men (Mark sand Jack) was actually very funny. I thought three of them played very well together and I found myself a little conflicted on who I did want to be the father. People keep saying that the ending was bad and it's depressing that the point of the movie is to get married and have kids and have a happy life. Well yes, for Bridget anyways that's what she actually wanted in life, even in the two previous movies. I couldn't believe reviewers talking down on Rennes new look she looks great for 43! And still just as funny awkward and likable. I found the part of her losing her job pretty inspiring and relevant, because in reality TV is a bunch of nonsense without any real importance. Like dumb cat videos for instance. All in all Bridget Jones is a 43 old woman who has been through plenty of embarrassing and heartbreaking moments and this movie is all about her finally getting her happy ending in a very true to herself way."
" sequel lacking bounce of the original
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"Without Hugh Grant in the ensemble the original magic falls apart. The setting is a contemporary Britain which in many ways charms for those interested in exploring it. Comics who have done this before, among them Colin Firth, Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones and Emma Thompson bring personal punch to their roles yet one way or another are not photographed or edited to best advantage this time out. Patrick Dempsey to me always did better in supporting romantic comedy roles than in leads and this time seems a fish out of Yankee waters in this British comedy. the hectic pace of romantic comedy is often photographed better than it is this time with too many cuts from shot to shot when the photogapher could have made the point another way and so could the editor."
" A witty return to form
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Like many I was very happy but skeptical when I heard the news of a third entry in the Bridget Jones series. It had been 12 years since the last film, The Edge of Reason, which deviated severely from its source material in the worst way possible and Helen Fielding had put out an awful third book Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, which seemed to destroy everything I loved about the series. First off: Bridget Jones's Baby is NOT an adaptation of Mad About the Boy, but its own zany creation. Second of all it's actually surprisingly good. Despite a 12 year gap Renee Zellweger slips into her Bridget persona flawlessly. She's able to anchor the film so that it still feels like a Bridget Jones film while introducing new characters like Jack Quant, a man Bridget instantly has a spark with at a music festival, and Sarah Solemani as Bridget's colleague and single friend, Miranda. Sharon Maguire (who directed the first Bridget film and was the inspiration for Shazzer), returns and seems able to get the best out of her cast. The film sees Bridget, now turning 43, as a successful news producer who is still single and childless. Deciding to embrace her state as a single spinster she goes to a music festival where she meets a handsome man about her age, and sleeps with him. A little while later, when at her godchild's christening, she runs into Mark Darcy, new divorced from the wife he married after they split up, and as sparks fly, she sleeps with him too, only to remember in the morning all the reasons they split up as he never had time with her and was always focused on work. Soon after she discovers she's pregnant with the titular baby.A huge part of the success of the film is down to the script which holds contributions from notorious wit Emma Thompson. It's really quite funny, but also has a lot of character bits so we believe in these characters and their decisions. The explanation for why Bridget and Darcy aren't together feels organic and real. Similarly the movie does a great job of showing who these characters would be 12 years on. Bridget has grown and figures out things in life while still keeping sense of humour and being a clumsy mess in certain situations. Rather than appearing haughty, Mark comes across as painfully shy, a careful man who now has many regrets from all the chances he didn't take. It's a wonderful, sweet movie, and a wonderful end to the Bridget Jones series."
