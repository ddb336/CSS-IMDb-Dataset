" It Makes Me Want to Live
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,10,"I loved this, a film as a series of scenes the significance of which register on the lovely, expressive face of the leading lady. I would hardly expect a contemporary film to exhibit such calm, quiet confidence in the most basic elements of cinema: talk, and pictures. Paula Beer was enchanting, the moral center of a potentially depressing story that instead affirms life. ""It makes me want to live."""
" End Wars..
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,9,"Every frame of this picture is exquisite from the gorgeous black and white through to the dissolves into colour. Its marvellous enough to watch a painterly film but this, with its fine story, rapturous emotions and universal corner will make any film lover want to go out and buy a copy to frame the thing. Seriously. Filled with beautiful people, characters and cast, it spends one's emotions but nothing in this wonderful film about loss, lost love and humanity comes cheap."
" Stunningly Beautiful in every way
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie that captures the heart and mind in ways that few other movies can. It deals with those most difficult of issues - grief, guilt, loss, trauma and loneliness - in a deeply sensitive, empathetic and thought-provoking manner that grabs the viewer from the start and refuses to let go.Beautifully written, astonishingly acted and directed with a sensitivity and intelligence that is deeply moving, this film will remain in the memory long after the credits have rolled.If you are not moved by this film,I can assure you it is not the film that needs to be questioned...."
" NOT a remake of ""Broken lullaby"" (Ernst Lubitsch)
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,8,"It is 1919 and a young French man arrives in a little German village and puts flowers on the grave of a victim of the First World War. What was the relationship between the French man and the dead German? What shall be the relationship between the Franch men and the fiancee of the dead German? These are the central questions in the film ""Frantz"" by Francois Ozon. The first question is answered roughly halfway, the answer to the second question remains uncertain until the very end.Up till now I had only seen ""Huit femmes"" (2002) and ""Swimming pool"" (2003) of Francois Ozon, and with the First World War drama ""Frantz"" Ozon goes ""for something completely different"" to use this Monty Python phrase.The story behind ""Frantz"" was adapted earlier by Ernst Lubitsch in ""Broken lullaby"" (1932). ""Frantz"" is however not a remake of this film, if only because Ozon telles the story from a different perspective. The German Lubitsch takes the young Frenchman as his main character (Adrien played by Pierre Niney in ""Frantz"") The Frenchman Ozon takes the German fiancee as his main character (Anna played magnificently by Paula Beer).This change of perspective is however not the only and not the most important difference between the two films. In ""Frantz"" Ozon takes a more complicated (but not necessarily negative) stance on the value of white lies versus the truth. In an interview about ""Frantz"" he says that behind each lie there is a desire.In contrast with ""Broken lullaby"" ""Frantz"" was made well after the Second World War. Ozon had therefore knowledge about the relationship between the peace treaty of Versailles, ending the First World War, and the outbreak of the Second World War. The scenes showing remaining virulent nationalism are in this respect very disturbing.""Frantz"" is shot mostly in black and white, but some scenes are in color. In such a case I can't help to ask myself if there is a logic behind these choice. During the film I found none. In the above mentioned interview Ozon told that the emotionally more optimistic scenes (the film is about two persons damaged by the war and trying to pick up their lives again) are in color."
" Tres Bon!
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,7,"Honestly I only recorded this film believing that it was about a gay romance during World War 1, however, while there was a homosexual undertone regarding their relationship at the beginning of the film, I was not too disappointed when it turned out not to be the case at all because the film was so well made and such a pleasure to watch regardless of the sadness at its core.Not only was it artistically filmed and beautiful in a sad way, but there was a great symmetry between the two lead characters and how they were shown or photographed. Not only that, but the occasional use of colour to show certain emotions in the mostly black and white film was genius.The casting was superb, using a great collection of faces that fit perfectly in the era of post war Germany and France.I wanted a drink throughout the film, but couldn't bring myself to pause it, because I was so keen to see what came next.Emotional, evocative and thoughtfully put together. A surprise to be sure and a happy one, even if it was not the most cheerful of settings or stories."
" Spring Awakening
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,9,"Another winner from Francois Ozon whose end credits appropriately describe it as a French-German co-production. Recalling the poignant scene with the French soldier in 'All Quiet on the Western Front', with a plot similar to Lubitsch's 'The Man I Killed' wedded to the flashback technique of Otto Preminger's 'Bonjour Tristesse' and a final shot that pays homage to 'Portrait of Jennie'."
" Fiction as a necessary lie
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,9,"This is a beautiful movie,-an integral work of art-about grief, the nature of lies, fiction as a necessary lie to go on, the victory of women over victimhood and surrender, the victory of a will-of-living over desperation and above all, a movie about forgiveness."
" The Wisdom of Forgiveness
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,8,"This is a good movie which might have been a masterpiece, if not for a few flaws here and there. Fortunately, the good outweighs the bad. The movie is set right after WWI and has a universal theme that is relevant even in the present context.The movie illustrates how hard it is for people to get on with their lives after losing a loved one. So acute is the void that gets created in our lives that whenever we come across someone who knew our lost loved one, we instantaneously form a bond with them. This is exactly what happens when Anna and the Hofmeisters meet Adrien. They all bond over their sweet memories of the titular character Frantz, who was a bright young pacifist forced to enlist in the army by his father. However, Adrien is harboring a secret which could plunge all the characters into immense emotional turmoil.The movie is rife with symbolism. Consider the moments showing suffusion of color into the otherwise black and white photography, the name chosen (Frantz) sounds like France, & the meanings of the last names Hofmeister and Rivoire. There is also the fact that even as Adrien seeks forgiveness from Frantz's loved ones for killing him, he ends up 'killing' Frantz again by replacing him in their affections.However, I must confess that I found two things about the film's characters that were a bit hard to empathize with. The first one is the painting by Monet which makes too many appearances. The choice of this painting somehow didn't make much sense to me. If I were in Louvre, with all its wonderful collection of world-class art, I wouldn't choose that particular painting as a favorite, irrespective of my state of mind. The second thing is the fact that Anna still has feelings for Adrien even after he confesses the truth to her. At this point, like any sensible person, she should realize that her feelings for Adrien are because of a rebound effect, even if she couldn't see it earlier. While I can understand that she forgave him and chose to let her foster parents believe the best of Adrien, I can't believe that she followed him to France to practically throw herself at him had it not been for Adrien's fiancee. I think this was a poor choice for her character. Wish the makers had treated her character with a little more dignity.The one big USP of the movie is that it isn't predictable at all. With so many twists & turns, it keeps the viewers guessing. Many situations, even those depicting disappointments, had such a ring of truth to them that you can't help but agree that this might actually happen in real life."
" I felt that
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,You can feel Paula Here's emotion through the screen. Exceptionally engrossing yet sad film.
" Art, War and Love
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,8,"Clearly a pacifist appeal for the salvation of art in catastrophic situations such as war, showing not only the equality between the parts that are part of the battle but also the raging blindness caused by the individualism of nations. An excellently accomplished film with relevant influences from other b / w films. However, he could have made better use of the rhythm, since the time gap between Frantz's death and the protagonist's semi-amorous encounter seems very short."
" A Story of Guilt and Atonement
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,7,"This story plays with the color tones. Some parts are held in color, some in color and b/w and most of the movie is held in b/w. It's the story of a young French man that fought in WWI and now travels from France to Germany for meeting a young woman to give her hold in her grieve about her fiance Frantz, who died in the battlefield.The story is told in a very slow speed in b/w to show the emotion that lies in grieving bereaved people. It also shows how people on both sides (G/F) felt about each other at that time. The Atmosphere of the beginning 1920s feels real - and it isn't told with a raised pointing finger. War brings out the worst in all people which are getting in touch with it. But love might heal the wounds, leaving the scars. That might be the best conclusion I can find for the movie.It isn't the best, but also not the worst movie of that kind. I did like it, specially because of the cast, which did the best to make a good movie. The play between b/w and color is appropraite for showing the mental state of the characters. I reccomend it for an art-movie audience."
" Strange Meetings
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,7,"There are echoes of Wilfred Owen's 'Strange Meetings' in Francois Ozon's film about people trying to rebuild their lives in Germany and France following the devestation of World War One, as a man takes the place of the enemy he killed in the trenches of the western front. Ozon has consructed a delicate, sensitive narrative, albeit one that is somewhat simplistic and not completely believable, and shot in a mixture of black and white and sepia; the feel is of a 1940s movie, although the setting is over two decades earlier. The medieval German town Quedlinburg provides much of the backdrop, an obvious choice for a 100-year old story as it has little changed from 400 years ago! The film's tone is naturally anti-war and makes you think about the meaning of the Marseillaise in a way that tends to pass you by when you merely hear a rousing tune; however, its constrast between willowly semi-pacifism and proto-fascism doesn't really illuminate how those in the middle are drawn one way or the other. I think of Ozon as the French equivalent of Michael Winterbottom; while neither are among my favourite directors, they both deserve credit trying something different with every film."
" A curve ball
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,10,"I stumbled upon this film whilst looking for something to watch on a cold rainy day at home.. I knew nothing about it whatsoever, apart from the fact it was (as appeared to be) a B&W war related movie.. I'm a war related movie fan!
Well well well..
Not what I was expecting.. Truly stunning in a simplistic way, the acting, the subtle visuals, the beauty of the camera work..
I hadn't expected to be faced with the reality of the aftermath of war, the guilt it imposes on the participants, the hostility that continued way beyond the guns falling silent..
The grief poured from each character, and my heart bled for The fiance at every twist and turn.
Despite being tempted to write about some of the truly amazing films I've watched, this is the one that finally made me feel I just had to say how good it is."
" Morose characters, depressing and pointless story
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,3,"If you are into movies with long periods of silence, lingering gazes and huge plot holes, then this will be for you. It moves at the pace of a snail going uphill and the viewer will be very happy that their remote has a fast forward button! 3/10 is being generous."
" Not as good as ""Broken Lullaby"" (1932)
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,6,"""Frantz"" is director Francois Ozon's loose re-working of ""Broken Lullaby"" (1932), a rarely seen film by Ernst Lubitsch based on a play by Maurice Rostand. The original was an atypical work for Lubitsch, a director known for his witty comedies. ""Broken Lullaby"" was a serious depiction of regret, and a pacifist manifesto. Between the two world wars it was also timely. 84 years later (!) Ozon is a bit late to join the conversation about Franco-German relations, but his version is going for a universalist spin of the narrative.I am not altogether against remakes, and if the original film has become obscure, newer re-tellings might bring it exposure. ""Broken Lullaby"" is a good film, but not a masterpiece, and hence it is a work that could benefit from a well-thought-out second stab by a capable director. However, if the viewer has seen the original, it affects the viewing experience of ""Frantz"", as Ozon tries to frame it as more of a mystery narrative than Lubitsch, whose film was tied closer to the perspective of the male lead.The film is set in 1919, in a small town in Germany. A mysterious Frenchman (Pierre Niney) has been bringing flowers to the grave of Frantz, a soldier who died in the recent war. The family of Frantz, consisting of a father (Ernst Stötzner), a mother (Marie Gruber) and a fiancee (Paula Beer), believe the Frenchman to be a friend of their son's, and quickly welcome him with open arms. It is as if they got a part of their son back. However, the stranger has a secret.The Lubitsch original featured no such element of mystery, as the film opened with a catholic confession. Out of the two, I preferred the way the original told the story-line. That is not to say ""Broken Lullaby"" is the superior film in every way. ""Frantz"" is acted much better. The leading man of the original, Phillips Holmes, was very stiff and did not feel the least bit French. Pierre Niney's take in this film is both gentle and sentimental. Nancy Carroll, the leading lady of ""Broken Lullaby"" felt more like a Hollywood star, whereas Paula Beer of this film delivers a fantastic performance, filled with inner turmoil. The fathers in both films, Lionel Barrymore and Ernst Stötzner, were really good.The anti-war message is clearer in the original, which is also the shorter of the two films. Ozon tells the first half of the film well enough, but the second half felt less cohesive, as the film also takes distance to the predecessor. I have liked several of Ozon's films, but also disliked many. He is not one of my favorites, as Lubitsch is. ""Frantz"" has some cheesy artistic choices that water down the narrative. First there is the color of the film. The film is mostly in black and white, as it depicts a world devoid of color because of the tragedy of war. Yet, every now and then there is a happy moment, which brings color to their lives, quite literally. I did not care for this choice. Another silly choice is the music. At times, the soundtrack plays a bit of ""Ode to Joy"", which is an anthem for the European Union. Thus the film's attempt to unify the peoples of France and Germany becomes anything but subtle. The third issue I had was the choice to name the fallen soldier ""Frantz"", as this sounds like ""France"", and would further serve the pacifism of the character. These are choices that a film-maker like Lubitsch would never have resorted to.""Frantz"" was overall a disappointment for me. The idea of a French director reworking a film by a German one fits the subject, but Ozon does not add much to the film, and doesn't have much to say about war and peace, that could be seen as original."
" Topical, yet historical
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,10,"In our current society in which populism and isolationism are so apparently popular, it is interesting and educational to see some of its risks. This movie subtly plays with the interplay of color and black&white as it does with the value of truth and lies. It plays with your attention as well as it plays with your emotions. If you can't feel this movie, you are beyond feeling. If so, I pity you and, if your attitude is commonly felt, I fear for our future."
" Why an 8 for this film ?
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,8,"I am asking the above question because I really did not like this film. First Paula Beer gave an extraordinary performance in a difficult role and that she, in my opinion was the only one to do so. This is unfortunate as the rest of the actors around her seemed to go through their paces and I longed for the dead Frantz not to be dead and come and shake them up again. As for the story it could have gone any number of ways and the first half hour or so I wondered what was at the heart of the ambiguity swirling around me. When the revelation came I was moved by it and the rest of the film appeared to sort out the consequences of this revealed truth. So what not to like ? Its morbidity for a start and the pall of death, suicide and telling lies so as not to hurt people. For those who like French literature it reminded me of a lost Julien Green novel adapted to the screen, and the suicidal motif only got more oppressive in the final image despite the possible intent that it was to do otherwise. Is there hope at the end ? I did not feel that there was and as the credits came up I was still swirling around in this inner hell within the characters and around them. I am trying to avoid a spoiler by saying I do not want to see a specific Manet again. But more searchingly I would like to know where exactly Ozon in his work is going ? Most of his films have left me cold, literally, and ' Le Temps qui Reste ' had a similar feel of morbidity, and a certain despairing feel towards death that goes back to German Romanticism. It is there too I think in the accompanying film to Francoise Hardy singing ' Le Large '. And yet out of all the hours of film he has made ' Le Large ' to me seems the best. I desperately want Ozon to surprise me but up until now I hope for that revelation all excellent films bring and have not as yet found it. Despite what I have said here I give the film an 8 for attempting to get to the heart and not quite managing to do so."
" Delicate and Beautiful
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,10,"This is a beautifully written, directed, filmed and acted film. It is very delicate, poetic and romantic. The almost minimalist cinematography is gorgeous . The main actress is beautiful and perfect for the role.
I have only watched one of Ozan's earlier films, 'Swimming Pool' which I totally loved and still remember after so many years and I now want to watch all his films."
" Excellent, if you get the 'colour-code'
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,10,"Incredibly touching and, although the central twist is easy to guess and is revealed early on, that doesn't matter. It also seems confusing until one realizes why the film keeps switching between black & white and colour. There are two parallel stories being told; which one do you want to be true?"
" A new classic
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,8,"It's difficult to find movies like this one nowdays. A reflexion about war, love and life. Great white & black photography."
" Without color but rich in everything else
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Not the second world war that is being used as a background here, but the first one. Which means there is no clear line that you can draw and say there are the bad Germans (for once). Then again, the way the behave around a french man who comes to visit a fallen soldiers family ... is really something and I reckon some may see seeds planted for what was about to happen later on in history and in Germany.Having said that, not all is as it seems and there will be some surprises along the way. Some weird choices but also some understanding. Trying to get to know others and trying to give some people a peace of mind - for better or worse. And the truth is not always setting everyone free - and that ending ""picture"" ... well that is something beautiful, which is a word that quite a few have used to describe the movie overall."
" Mezmerizing!
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,9,"I started to watch Frantz and it was fine at first, a slow start...
I found out pretty soon what Adrian is hiding...
But as the movie continued, I was drawn into it more and more...
At the begining it felt cold and distant and then it turned to be more emotional and dramatic.
At the end my eyes became full of tears...
What a sensitive delicate story.
I'm simply blown away by the mastership of Francois Ozon here.
And I empathizes with Anna: trying not to hurt anybody. What a beautiful soul... <3"
" A love story, with amazing pace and mesmerising pictures.
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,9,"The entire aesthetic of the movie is based in the rhythm of the story. The drama, and the way the characters grow along the entire movie keep you stucked to your seat and images are just dazzling."
" Powerful
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,10,The music soundtrack to this film was incredible. The story actors the sequence of events very clever. I'm just guessing but I feel like this story could have unfolded exactly as it was pretrade in this film. We'll life is stranger than fiction and I can only imagine the heart rending circumstances that people had to contend with after this catastrophic world war. One things for sure don't watch this movie if you were depressed because it brings grief through loud and clear. This is an amazing film with an amazing soundtrack and amazing actors. Absolutely loved it
" Remarkably sensitive film
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,8,"This is a story about how lying can be a good thing, a compassionate thing. When the female lead, Anna, goes to confession about her lies concerning her encounter with a Frenchman who seems to have known her dead finance, a victim of WWI, the priest in her German town tells her that her lies were totally forgiveable because they were meant well. This sounds simple, but the story is also about the aftermath immediately following WWI and the French and German feelings about one another's country and people. A film which begins perhaps in a mediocre way but becomes increasingly affirmative with the development of the plot."

",2018-04-29 00:00:00,8,"A beautiful film about loss,forgiveness and love.Stunning performances from Paula Beer and Pierre Niney.All through the movie it felt very atmospheric and moving, well worth watching as I have done more than once.Lovely soundtrack too by Philippe Rombi"
" CLOSE TO THE POINT, BUT ALAS...
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,5,"Wartime stories are kind a worn out genre, even in Europe, which tried to give them some more humane touch (""A very long engagement"", ""Atonement"", ""Enemy at the gates""). 
""Frantz"" is one of those humane dramas about the gallantry and knighthood between the enemies and a discreet love triangle that emerges among the hatred and fresh wounds after the ending of First World War. 
Slow tempo and gradual building of tension will seduce the viewer in the first part of the movie, but will leave the story open and pretty much without the required climax and outcome.
""Frantz"" is a solid piece of war/love drama, but not a special one as well."
" Simple, beautiful and true
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,9,"This film is true in the sense that it portrays universal truths about human beings, their interactions and their effects on one another. The story, about a Frenchman who comes to visit the grave of a German soldier after World War I, is one that begins with a simple gesture and then takes us along for a ride through the fields of human longing. Many of the people in the German town resent the Frenchman. They are bitter about losing the war and quite a few families there lost sons in the conflict. They do not treat him with hostility, but they are correct in their behavior, not friendly. The one person who does take to him is the sister of the dead German, whom the Frenchman claims to have known years earlier in Paris.He establishes an endearing friendship with the parents of the dead German soldier, tells them what he remembers of their son and listens to their stories about him. Little by little we can see an attraction growing between him and the sister.I will leave at that so as not to make a spoiler/ Suffice it to say that what he and the young woman discover through their friendship is a connection to the truth, not just in details about something that has happened and can never be taken back, but in the sense of learning about their own feelings and their own destinies. The story is told in vibrant black and white for the most part and the cinematography is superb. The acting is also outstanding. There are no big emotional outbursts this movie, only subtle movements, glances and soft conversations that reveal all that needs to be revealed.GMF"
" poignant sadness
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,7,"It's 1919 in the small town of Quedlinburg, Germany. Anna dutifully lays flowers at her financee Frantz Hoffmeister's grave. She's living with his parents who are still devastated from his death at the front. An unknown Frenchman named Adrien is visiting Frantz's grave. He tells them that he's a friend from their time in Paris.The black and white look is poignant and sad. There are interesting sections of colour. I do question if the Hoffmeisters would not question Adrien's story. It's obvious where the story is going. There are good moments throughout. The most powerful is Anna on the train as she first witnesses the war damage. The ending has a good helping of understated sadness but I was looking for something even darker. This film is poetic and works fine."
" provocative
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,9,"First, because it is an Ozon. so, your expectations are well defined. 
second - it seems be familiar. your memories about ""Broken Lullaby"" are the basic clue. but, ""Frantz"" is different. special. surprising. yes, provocative. for motifs out of words. it is a love story. and more. it is a war film. and more. it is the story of a meeting and discover and family and clash between different cultures. and, off course, more. because all has the status of source for new steps on a way without rules, limits and forms of delicacy remaining unique. a film like one of yours memories. seductive. moving. discret . convincing. like an old song . or a flavour. so, an experience. fragil, strange, useful. about force and vulnerability. preserving not only the realistic images of a lost period but, in refreshing manner, its spirit. so, ""Frantz"". it is enough its title for define each aspect of this, in charming way, film."
" Old story, new angle
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,10,"What an awesome surprise. Saw that it was free streaming on Amazon Prime and took a chance. Watch the trailer, it will just want to make you see the movie even more. You think you know where the story is going, but then you don't.It's about French/German relations after ""The Great War."" But, so much more. The theme? War is stupid, love is great.... what's new? Remember the name Francois Ozon, as a director. He will become one of the best known ever in the years to come. And, remember Paula Beer, German actress, only 22 yrs. old when she made this. We'll be seeing a lot more of her. If she ever decides to do movies in English, look out Alicia Vikander."
" the beauty of forgiveness and hope
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,10,"I rarely watch movies and don't care much for the cinema in general. But when I first saw this film on a plane, it so haunted me that I watched it twice after that, at home. From the first moment, you are irresistibly drawn to the main characters, each of whom is battling with inner fears, loss, and grief after the end of world war one. The acting is superb, the dialogues full of subtleties and sensitiveness. the photography beautiful. Among the main themes are love, loss, deception, and truth, but especially forgiveness and honour. The main actors never give in to cheap sentiment or selfishness, but show a depth of character and nobility of spirit that is not often seen in modern cinema -- or in real life for that matter. One of the few movies I would happily re-watch a dozen times!!"
" Two people crawl back from the depths of war
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,9,"This movie was a very beautiful story about a relationship that springs from World War I (1914-1918). It caught my attention because of director François Ozon, whose originality and insight I've admired in his other movies. The characters in this movie are a German war widow and a French soldier; the dialogue is in French. Set in two countries that fought on opposite sides of the war, it presents the hostility that people on both sides felt towards one another. Yet a strong light of the human spirit shines through as the main characters deal with the burden of war. The movie is mainly in black/white which to me works well with the urban settings, good acting and script. The plot does not follow a predictable path as the two characters from opposite sides of German/French divide meet and become friends to honour someone whose life drew them together. This friendship is the central theme. The settings, whether in a cemetery, dance hall, beer house, or at a dinner table reinforce the period atmosphere. The movie doesn't have an ending that conveniently ties things up but it doesn't need to. It rests on its own merits."
" Poetry!
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,10,"This film is poetry on celluloid. Beautiful, lyrical, powerful, thoughtful, artistic. I could go on... In essence it is a very complex love story set in Germany and France in 1919,the horrors of the Great War still very vivid, very recent and very painful. Complex it may be. But you can follow the story line with no problem, despite its many misleading twists and turns. Much of the plot has to do with well intentioned lies. But that is an over simplification. The story is tender and lovely with moments of both joy and sadness. The film is mostly black and white, done with the rich depth and shading that are so effective when handled by a master. Some scenes are in colour however. They're effective and nicely done but I'm puzzled about their purpose. No matter! This is one beautiful, unique and memorable film."
" Sensitive and deals with a number of issues
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,8,"I saw the trailer for this foreign film in the last week. What appealed to me was the sensitivity between the male and female leads. It was shot mainly in black-and-white. It seemed to have a measured pace to it that was perhaps covering up some deep emotion. The trailer had some beautiful cinematography in a scene by a lake. The trailer set up a bit of a mystery which was intriguing.So the timing was right tonight and on a romantic whim I went to see it. I thought I knew why the character Adrian claimed he was a friend of Frantz. But as it turned out I was wrong. I was pleased to be wrong and be therefore taken on a ride along where the film took me. The film was set in Germany and Paris in 1919 and explores the attitudes between the French and Germans still raw after WW1.I enjoyed it. The film dealt with a number of issues: guilt, pride, love, loss, heartache, nationalism and others.These days there is so much below-average Hollywood pap that is not worth seeing, it's a pleasant change to experience a film that is more human.I recommend it."
" Man and woman undergo the repercussions of war on their lives
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,9,"Surprised by the effectiveness and impact of this well-made, well-acted film. Slow paced which appropriately unfolds this story with twists and turns and an ending that does not give in to happy ending temptations. Balances very well the two main themes of what happened and what didn't happen between the two soldiers. in my opinion a worthy nomination for an Oscar for best foreign film (was it nominated?). Keeps you thinking about it after you leave the movie theater. A wonderful antidote to the slick, often over-action films that too often mark the contemporary film scene."
" victims of war
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,8,"'Frantz' is one of those films that follows you long after the screening is over. What I and maybe many other viewers of François Ozon's 2016 film will remember years from now will be the silhouettes of the two principal heroes - the beautiful German young woman Anna (interpeted by Paula Beer) whose lover, Frantz, fell on the front two months before the end of the First World War and the out-of-world French young man Adrien Rivoire (actor Pierre Niney) who is also an ex-soldier, has met Anna's lover some time in the past, and comes to put flowers on his empty grave and ease the grief of Anna and Frantz's parents. One may say that Pierre Niney is a miscast, and maybe this is true, but he is a miscast not as an actor, but in the world his fate was to live in.Frantz himself gives the name of the film, as all characters are tormented by his absence, his falling in the war makes him the victim, but actually everybody in this film is a victim of the absurdity of the war. The film succeeds to present in a moving manner how destinies are cut short by war, and how difficult are healing, forgetting, forgiving. It also asks questions about the capability of humans to cope with the horrors of the past - can they do it while facing the truth which is sometimes more cruel than their imagination allows? Or maybe lies are allowed when they can help healing or avoid reopening fatal wounds?Ozon's film also carries an anti-war message. The heroes belong to the two sides of a war that created devastation for both nations. One may have been victor, the other defeated, but both countries are in ruins, millions of lives were lost, the survivors continue to carry the scars of the war traumas but also the germs of hate that will be at the root of the next war. The symmetry of scenes and situations may seem demonstrative, but it's good to remember that blood, enmity and mistrust divided Europe no so long ago.The film makes use of black and white for the majority of the time, with colors inserted in some key moments, without necessarily marking the borders between reality and imagination, past and present, truth or fiction. It was a very good idea in my opinion to avoid the trap of a happy ending and to leave more ambiguity in place, with a mysterious lesser known painting of Manet handling to the viewers the key to what may have happened next. Questions marks are relevant for both past and future."
" Beautiful and Moving Film on the loss and love that war brings
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,8,"Set in the German town of Quedlinberg in 1919 we meet Anna. Her fiancé –Frantz – has been killed near the end of The Great War and she mourns at an empty grave – his body having never been repatriated. She lives with his parents who are both grieving in different ways. Then one day she sees a man weeping at the graveside and discovers he is French. He soon makes himself known as a pre war friend of their beloved Frantz and breaks down their initial hostility towards him to get to know them better.But all is not what it seems and this becomes a story of not one but two odyssey's as the storie(s) unfold along twist and turns. The film is shot in monochrome and colour. When it is black and white it is where things are bleak as if all the colour has drained from the world and then when love and hope appear so does the radiant colours. A simple enough device but done with subtle intensity an a film that takes its cinematography, rightfully, seriously.The acting is all sublime with Piere Niney ('Yves St. Laurent') as the Frenchman – Adrien Rivoire – being perfectly cast balancing the fragility and immediacy of the role perfectly. Paula Beer as Anna really grows into her role too, which is necessary from the plots development and from the actual character development and is prefect also. All supporting actors are just spot on. The film also shies away from the melodrama that is often associated with extremes of emotion and take the everyday and makes it important.This is one of those films that comes along all too seldom. It is in French and German with good subtitles. Yes it can be called 'Arthouse' but it is also a simple but powerful story told with great care and skill and is a film that will reward you for sticking with it to the end – easily recommended."
" I'm not that guy...but
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,10,"Look, I'm not that guy to write reviews of movies online, and I'm not that guy to watch a love story with subtitles. But quite by happenstance I watched this film, and I was blown away. I didn't think I was going to make it at first, to be honest, due too the pace. But Paula Beer (whom I've never seen before this movie) kept me watching. What a great actress for this role! By the movie's end I was wishing for more, begging the movie not to end. I sat and stared at the credits' scroll (words I couldn't understand in French) and listening to the music. It's that good that I stared in awe at the credit scroll! I'll now go back to watching Mission Impossible and Bourne movies (more my style), but I'll always remember Frantz, and a part of me will always wish that I could experience it again for the first time."
" subtitles
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,7,When watching a movie we hate to read subtitles throughout whole movie. The plot was great tho. But having to read in whole movie is not enjoyable. I wish that in movie reviews = it would be noted that there are subtitles. I am sure that some other people feel the same way. That is why my rating is 7 .
" Sentimental Kitsch
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,4,"After seeing the trailer I was genuinely interested in this film. I felt that World War I and the immediate post-war years are generally underrepresented in film, and the trailer promised a suspenseful romance/mystery.My enthusiasm turned into disappointment after the first 30 minutes of the film. Cliché dialogues, which I thought to be a stylistic device at first, just became silly and repetitive. It seemed Characters constantly uttered melancholy lines and broke out into tears seemingly at random. The wooden acting did not help at all. In the end I actually found it quite upsetting that the suffering of World War I was being exploited for such a dull tearjerker.The themes of European rapprochement after World War I and individual forgiveness had a lot of potential in my opinion, but in the way this film dealt with them, this potential was almost entirely wasted."
" This movie is ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,10,"I haven't watched a movie like this for a very, very, very long time, the casting is pure genius! Acting is 'off the scale', sets are 'jump into the screen' material!... This movie is pure artistry in the making. If I was an American I'd be asking for a ""Part 2"" lol..... MASSIVELY, O 4 AWESOME BRILLIANT movie!!!"
" Loving thy enemy
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,10,"François Ozon's latest movie Frantz packs in audience pleasers: superb black-and-white photography of spellbinding locations; nonstop suspense; brilliant character portrayals by Paula Beer as Anna and Pierre Niney as Adrien; the subject of war's pointlessness; the right or wrong of lies; and human psychology when it comes to love. This last and most compelling aspect of the movie, discussed below, is for a post-viewing conversation (i.e., this review may be a spoiler). The movie begins in Quedlinburg, Germany, after World War I, with the Hoffmeister family grieving for the loss of Frantz, Magda and Hans' son and Anna's fiancée. The three live together, Anna already like a daughter to Frantz's parents. Hans and the Germans in town bitterly hate the French for killing their sons. Frenchman Adrien Rivoire shows up to lay flowers on Frantz's grave and as a result meets Anna who brings him home to her surrogate parents. Over time, Frantz's parents come to love and cling to Adrien for his past friendship in Paris to their lost son. Adrien becomes a living embodiment of Frantz, keeping him alive for the parents. It helps that Adrien comes from the same cultured class as the Hoffmeisters—he formerly played violin in a prominent Paris orchestra. Adrien's last name Rivoire is too close to the French word revoir—to see again—not to have special meaning for Adrien's role in this story. Love comes in all shapes and sizes. Anna and Adrien's love presents the movie's most fascinating content. Adrien, caught in the difficult situation of meeting Frantz's parents (with the postwar Germans and French hating each other), weaves more and more lies about his friendship to their son. Adrien's a meek, malleable person, which becomes his character flaw in the end when he goes along with his mother's choice for a wife. He has no mettle, no courage, and chooses an easier path controlled by others. In Quedlinburg, spending time with the Hoffmeisters and learning about Frantz's past, Adrien becomes part of the family. When he finally confesses to Anna what really happened in the battle trenches, she's naturally devastated. But she doesn't reveal the truth to Frantz's parents—she spares them yet another grief, this one involving Adrian's travesty. Here the movie lets us ponder lies—Adrien's lies, Anna's decision to keep up his lies, and what the future will be for her maintaining and further developing them for the remainder of the Hoffmeisters' lives. Are some lies acceptable? To what extent? Can Anna ever live a fulfilling life if she perpetrates serious lies? So many people, so many families, live out their lives harboring such secrets and lies, and Anna's case is but one example. After Anna has learned the horrible truth from Adrien, she must begin all over in her nascent love for him, and succeeds. Once she has forgiven him—which entails understanding the stupidity of war, where one soldier in a trench has no choice but to kill his enemy or be killed—she allows her love to rekindle. But what shape and size is Anna's love? It's one of life's more mysterious forms, where the young woman loves the very person who killed her lover; it's a love that encompasses the killer's connection to the past love, a strange mix but real and food for thought. The same is true for Adrien: he loves the woman of the man he killed as if, again, Frantz's taken life can resurrect permanently through the new bond. It's a love triangle of a warped sort. The Hoffmeisters also want the Anna-Adrien union for the same reason—the men's supposed bond of yore joined to Anna now will keep Frantz forever within the living family. Weird, but not weird, precisely because love has so many faces. A few other points about the movie: The parallel structure of Adrien experiencing German hatred in Quedlinburg, and then Anna, in part two, experiencing anti-German behavior in France, works to emphasize the antiwar message. Plus we are told a few times that Frantz, like Adrien, was a pacifist. Indeed, his rifle in the trench where he died was not loaded. He would rather be killed than kill. The score by Philippe Rombi sets the mood for every scene and the film's nonstop suspense, but it never intrudes on the action. Its apt subtlety achieves perfection. Finally, at those rare moments where joy in nature or the good things in life occur, the movie switches to color, briefly, like the quick glows we all experience in life. Then the story returns to the black and white of the war's bleak aftermath, not unlike Italian neorealism except for the sumptuous quality of this movie's cinematography. Manet's painting Le Suicidé (The Suicide) comes up several times. It relates directly to Anna and Adrien's mental destitution about the truth of what happened to Frantz. However, it's not answered why this painting was one of Frantz's favorites, nor why Anna visits it at the end of the movie when she's embarking on her ""freed"" life in full blooming color. The man viewing the painting on the bench beside to her is just like Adrien—sensitive, effete, melancholy. Are the two sitting there before a depiction of suicide to show their contrast—Anna no longer tied to Frantz or the past and the man dealing with suicidal thoughts? Or, is it suggested that Anna's past will link these two strangers in an uncanny love? Will Anna connect to him because he's like Adrien, who in turn was the embodiment of Frantz? Love and human psychology are the tantalizing material of this film."
" Casting takes me out of the movie
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,4,"366/5000 I can not avoid thinking all the time, that I do not like the actor, I'm not going for that role. The whole movie is thinking that there will be a romance between the two and how that lady is going to roll up with that guy. I think the film is too long, it is exhausting because the tempo is very slow. It has moments that I do not know if they are crazy of the director or that they are.The sexual tension is so evident in the film that he runs all the time, between him and her and sometimes you think between the two men. She's great, but he does not like me at all.I do not know if anyone would react as the character of the actress does, after everything that happens in the film. It seems incredible to me that someone forgives so much in such a short time.The photograph to be in black and white, takes you to that time and the whole setting helps a lot to it. That's achieved, like the costumes and the make-up.The address is as it always does. A very slow tempo. Simple plans, at least they are not bad. But the casting is very bad.It's for the director's lovers, others will get bored.Spoiler: I do not know why the dead man is seen reflected in a mirror winking."
" What is the most painful, the war or the lies?
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,8,"This is pleasantly a surprise film. I would say it is this year's the Oscar winning film 'Ida'. Frankly, there's nothing to compare between two. Not just both of them are modern black and white film, but they are quite similar in the portrayal of lead female characters. Just like 'Marie's Story', it was also inspired by another Hollywood film, 'Broken Lullaby'. I haven't seen that. Even not many people have seen it. One of the less known classic drama which I am going to give a try now. Coming back to the film, it was about the World War I that centres on a young woman who lost her fiancé.Nearly two hours drama, quite slowly narrated, but I never felt drag in storytelling or boring to follow it. From the director of 'In the House', yet another masterpiece. Yeah, it looked like that way for me. Only a very few characters and they all developed so well, almost till the end when a few more joined them. The title role was appeared for like only 4-5 minutes in the entire film. Well, that was the topic, a reason for this story to begin along with the WWI. Though the following storyline was built on a different platform.Like there is a saying 'to hide one lie, a thousand lies are needed', that's what this film was actually about. Living and keep on evolving in the endless process. It is a moral, a message film, but the mistake was committed by someone else that another person has to take the fall for it, even after he goes out of the picture. Really a touching story, but not a tearjerker. The journey of life is sometimes unexpected, particularly when it comes to romance that blooms when one needed it last at the circumstance he's at his life.❝What would the truth bring? More pain, more tears.❞This is not a war film, just in case if you are expecting one. It was a subject under everything happen. So, there's only less than 5 minute clips of them in the film. Basically, those clips too were not required, but it's always nice to see them in pictures when a flashback come into play. It is a pure drama that sets in just after the end of the WWI. A young German woman is mourning for the death of her fiancé. She discovers a young French man who claims his close friend came to condole his demise. He meets the rest of the family and shares those happy days he spent with him in Paris before the war. During his stay, they all get along quite well, despite the people from society are against it/him.That was the first half of the film, developed slowly and steadily, but ended with a twist. The following half began on the new direction with lots of mysteries surrounding. Completely unpredictable, yet as a viewer, I had hundred of different thoughts about the upcoming developments. I was somewhat right on most of the occasion, but I was even happier about how it all went on its own style. Now the story entered the France. More twist and turns unfolded. The pace of the story looked the same, though lots of developments made it look advanced very fast.The World War II is the most dominated theme in the war films. When you see a film on WWI, you will come to realise its perspective, if the film was made with the right dose of everything, even if it was not based on the real event or the person. Fighting the war, carrying the wound, grieving for the lost ones, struggling to rebuild the life and the nation. This is definitely one of the best WWI related, I mean about the aftermath of the war films I've seen. The screenplay was magic. I would surely give an award for it. And then the beautiful photography. I don't know it was because of the black and white, but virtually you would be taken back to the 1919. Simple, yet a great camera angles that must be appreciated.Wonderful cast. Without those amazing performances, this film would have been nothing. Anna is the name you would remember for very long and the actress who played it. In a couple places, the screenplay turns semi colour, particularly when musics takes the front stage. Just in case if you are yet to watch, pay attention to that, because not everybody notices that. To me it looks like an Oscar product, but the release date confirms not eligible for the next Oscars. Different people have different opinion, but I think it is a must see. Those who struggle with slow paced narration, if they manage the opening half, then they would enjoy the remaining and love the overall film. Definitely a hidden gem, it just needs more audience, that's all.8.5/10"
" Lullaby Of The Lives
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,7,"One of the downsides of the world of Theatre and Film is the way it inspires journeymen to think they are capable not only of standing comparison with but actually eclipsing their betters and being encouraged by those who should know better. In 2011 we had the very lacklustre Terence Davies kidding himself that he could write a better version of The Deep Blue Sea than its onlie begetter Terence Rattigan and the fact that the resulting film was a joke did little or nothing to prevent the BFI genuflecting at the very mention of his name. Now we have Francois Ozon stepping into the ring with Ernst Lubitsch who, in 1932, turned out an exquisite film, Broken Lullaby, on the futility of war. Ozon, completely unable to lay a glove on Lubitsch, settles for shooting Paula Beer in solitude surrounded by vast, empty landscapes, which is of course nice enough to look at but remains light years short of the 'Ozon touch' to which he clearly aspires. In Ozon's favour there are probably thousands of film goers who won't be aware of Broken Lullaby and will therefore find Frantz half decent."
" It is as good as its awards from around the various festivals.
",2017-05-17 00:00:00,10,"Diane and I viewed this brilliant film yesterday at Fremantle's art cinema and we both shared the absolute same high regard for the wonderful film that we had just seen. The film was so rich in cinematography, dialogue, acting and scripting that both of us were totally absorbed in this cinematic experience. I am old to the point where I have difficulty following subtitles: either they are too quick so that I can't read them before they disappear or they are too small and in the wrong print colour for this film they were perfect. The print was not too small, too fast or the wrong colour so for an old guy the visuals were perfection personified. As to the substance of the film's script, the action takes place two years after the end of WW I and involves two soldiers who met during the war and the family of one of these soldiers after the war. The drama is intense and its intricacies are sobering and manifest. A film to anticipate and make every effort to attend."
" A beautifully filmed essay about guilt, lies and loss in the between-wars era
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,8,"Nations reconcile after war but it is only people who can grant forgiveness. For many, it is an impossible grant that leaves wounds unhealed. This theme dominates the Franco-German film Frantz (2017), a psychological drama about a former soldier's personal quest for forgiveness. Filmed mostly in black and white, it is a poetically beautiful essay about guilt, lies, and tragic loss, set in the between-wars era.The storyline is shaped by deep grief and national hatreds. In a small German village, Anna (Paula Beer) is grieving the death of her fiancé Frantz who was killed fighting in France. She visits his gravesite daily and one day finds that someone else has left flowers on the grave. A few days later she finds a stranger standing solemnly at the headstone and introduces herself to a brooding Frenchman called Adrien (Pierre Niney). They are soon in conversation and Anna is shocked to hear that Adrien had spent time with Frantz in Paris, sharing a love of music, art, and good times. Anna introduces Adrien to Frantz's parents who bitterly blame all French people for their son's death. As the parents hear Adrien share his grief and his memories of Frantz, a bond begins to form between all of them, at first reluctantly then warmly. But the mysterious Adrien is harbouring a tragic secret. Eventually he breaks down and confesses to Anna with whom a romantic attachment has developed. She immediately shuns him and he returns to Paris. Time elapses and she cannot forget him. Urged by the parents, she goes to Paris to find Adrien where she must confront a new loss and learn about forgiveness.For audiences expecting an action-driven narrative, there little on offer in this film. The story moves forward in sombre but exquisite monochrome and often tense dialogue that is punctuated by a few scenes in colour as respite from melancholy. The performances of its four main roles are laden with emotion but stops short of melodrama. The principals Paula Beer and Pierre Niney give finely nuanced performances evoking the behavioural norms of the era. All performances are high-wire acts of emotion and dramatic tension: the pain on the parent's faces when they hear stories of their son is palpable and the tense suppression of Adrien's dark secret is electric. Anna's struggle between her loyalty to the cherished memory of Frantz and the possibility of new love is mirrored in the Franco-German struggles with blame, guilt, grief, and hope. As the relationship between Anna and Adrien strengthens there are several lyrical scenes of languid days enjoyed at the side of a pond that are composed like painting masterpieces and emblematic of the artistry brought to the making of this film.Frantz is multi-layered with intense emotion that is explored at the personal and national levels. Truth is always the first victim of war and where truth fails, lies, promises and secrets take over. Frantz can rightly be described as an art-house feminist film. By taking Anna's viewpoint it encompasses universal themes of agency over victimhood that empower her to move on in her life."
" A beautiful movie, full of unexpected turns
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I could watch this movie a hundred times just to see the beauty that is in it. It may be the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. But it is much, much more than that. It is a fascinating historic film about a very important time and place that Americans know far too little about. And it is a romantic mystery. The actors in the film are among the best on earth and everything about ""Frantz"" is first-rate. But the reason that most people will love watching this film is because it is so full of twists and turns that keep the audience guessing. I doubt that anybody will ever predict how the film ends. After you leave the theater you will realize that the ending made sense, but you will never guess it ahead of time. I fell in love with almost every character in the film."
" motives and color change
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Francois Ozon won me over as a fan for life with his 2003 writing-mystery Swimming Pool. His latest stands in stark contrast to that gem, as there are no mind games for the viewer, other than those the characters play on each other. Actually, this is quite a straightforward story of romance, loss and hope; and it's an example of expert filmmaking from a director in full control of story, setting, character and camera.It's 1919 in historic and ancient Quedlinburg, Germany. WWI has recently ended and the loss of her soldier fiancé is still so fresh for Anna (an excellent Paula Beer) that she makes daily treks to lay flowers on the grave of Frantz. She spots an unknown foreigner paying respects to Frantz, and since it's a small town, the two are soon enough sitting together in the parlor of Frantz' parents' house where Anna lives. It's an awkward encounter between a grief-stricken German family and a Frenchman paying respects to the family of a fallen ""friend"".That these folks are so quick to accept and encourage these recollections of Adrien (Pierre Niney) speaks loud and clear to human nature in times of grief – we desperately cling to any connection, positive memory, or new strand of information. Then again, Adrien's perspective is every bit as interesting as that of the parents and Anna. He seeks forgiveness and inclusion, yet is unable to come clean on his motives and past.More human nature is on display as we initially see how the Germans treat the (outsider) Frenchman, and then later as Anna travels to France, we see how the French treat this (and presumably all) German. Anger, mistrust and deceit are ever-present amongst this group of people who seemingly only want a touch of happiness, and it's fun to note the parallels between the initial story in Germany and the later time in France.Director Ozon flips between black & white and the periodic use of color when hope and new direction exists. It provides a personal and dramatic look to the film, along with visual clues as to what's really occurring on screen, and is nicely complemented by the flowing score from Phillipe Rombi (Swimming Pool, Joyeux Noel). Ozon also selects one of Manet's lesser known paintings, Le Suicide, as a link between the past and the terrific ending that reinforces the movie's message, ""life goes on""."
" Wanna-be important WWI movie falls short
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,5,"""Frantz"" (2016 release from France: 110 min.) brings a WWI-related story. As the movie opens, we are reminded that it is ""Quedlinberg, 1919"". We get to know a woman whom we later learn is named Anna. Anna is bringing flowers to the grave of Frantz, a German soldier she was engaged to but who perished in World War I. To her surprise, Anna notices that someone else also has brought flowers to the grave. It is not long before she finds out that a Frenchman is visiting the grave on a daily basis. Before too long, she meets and invites the Frenchman to meet her and the parents of Frantz with whom she now lives. Who is this mysterious Frenchman? What will become of Anna? At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments double: first, this is the latest movie from veteran French director François Ozon, and as a result, my expectations for this movie were quite high. Alas, it was not to be. This can be attributed to various factors: first and foremost, the movie deems itself quite important, but lacks the heft to prove it. The acting performances are mostly wooden, if not stilted, and you can practically hear the director's command for ""Action!"". By the time the Big Reveal comes midway through the movie, we should care a lot, but I found myself not caring all that much. That is unfortunate, and the movie simply cannot overcome that in the second hour. Along the way, the movie touches on the simmering resentment among Germans pertaining to the harsh terms of their WWI surrender, and the corresponding rising nationalism, but here again, the movie simply lacks in depth. On the plus side, the movie is mostly shot in gorgeous black and white photography (the flashbacks are in color). Bottom line: my high expectations for this movie were not met, and then some.""Frantz"" opened in US theaters this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at, was attended OK but not great. Given the pretty somber nature of the movie, I cannot see this playing long in the theaters. If you have a keen interest in WWI, you may wish to check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on Blu-ray/DVD. Just keep your expectations in check."
" A delicate and restrained study of grief, guilt, love and forgiveness
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,9,"I found this intensely moving in unexpected ways...yes, there were the conventional triggers of war, death, loss etc. but it was so much more complex than that. The choice of black and white seemed appropriate for the period, (other reviews have referred to some scenes being in colour, but I don't think I saw any color whatsoever...maybe I'm wrong) and reminded me of Japanese films made by Ozu which can also portray very deep emotions without anyone raising a voice. This was restrained, beautifully paced, and reflected a time when people held their feelings in, in order not to make others suffer more. I had no trouble finding the events and the behavior totally believable.The end wasn't what I might have predicted, but it was so much more ""right"" than anything else could possibly have been. It was the sort of ending a confident director, who knows his characters, would give the audience. In my opinion, a beautiful film."
" Innocence is the first casualty of war
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,10,"It's 1919, immediately after World War I murdered of so many of Europe's young. In a small German town, the mysterious appearance of flowers on the grave of a young German soldier ignites the curiosity of his grieving fiancé, Anna (Beer) who finds them. When she tells the dead boy's shattered parents, they connect the flowers to the young Frenchman, Adrien (Niney), with whom the doctor had refused to speak because of his bitterness about the loss of his only son.The story that unfolds is a fascinating vignette of side-by-side civilisations in the wake of incomprehensible barbarity perpetrated by and on each other's children, at the behest of their parents. This is a massive story, elicited via the fascinating device of a haunted young man's search for redemption and a young girl's ability to contemplate it. The settings, costume and characters, coupled with the use of sepia film tones are highly evocative of the era and I felt utterly immersed in the enormous insanity of that four year crime, in whose shame-riddled aftermath the world was desperately trying to pretend there was a normalcy to which it could ever return."
" Reconciling Truths and Lies, Light and Darkness
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,9,"At the grave of her fiancé, Anna is startled to find a strange foreigner overcome with emotion. Anna's curiosity leads her to find out more about this stranger, and deeper still as she begins to understand the nature of his visit. It concerns forgiveness and sympathy for the lives of others, yet also cowardice, suffering, war and dark secrets. A similar mix of emotions swirls within and around Anna. Lies as well as truths are revealed. It becomes difficult to tell one from the other. Anna and the foreigner, Adrien, attempt to reconcile the truths with the lies, and the light with the darkness. This is done not merely through words, but with the way the wind moves through the trees, chords of the piano and violin, an unexpected swim, a beautiful view from a hill top, and more.Part of the magic of the film is in the way it reveals how we are all as vulnerable as Anna and Adrien. There are dark secrets in all of us that may be turned to love, or perhaps other way around. Standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon obscured by mist, I felt a wave of emotion as the fog lifted and I could see the whole chasm – a mile deep and ten miles across, open in all its color and depth before my eyes. I felt a similar wave of emotion as this film shifted back and forth from black and white to color. Later I talked with a couple who disagreed. They thought the color shifts were too obtrusive and told them what to think. Yet good story tellers, as Ozon surely is, will toy with emotions in this way. I thought the shifts and cinematography were wonderful. The film characters are appropriately complex. The plot takes intriguing twists and turns. Themes include an anti-war element that Ozon deals with subtlety and adeptly. He doesn't rub our faces in it. The film is set in Germany and France in the aftermath of World War I, yet the themes are just as poignant today. The war is over, didn't you hear?! Languages and settings shift between German and French. Seen at the Miami International Film Festival."
" Between the World Wars survivors struggle with guilt and despair.
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,10,"The eponymous character is a cultured, pacifist, loving German young man whose doctor father urged him to fight for the fatherland. He gets the title because his spirit haunts the film — as the heroine Anna's lost love, as the Hofmeisters' lost son and as the kindred spirit his killer, the French solider Adrien, comes to love through his family and their memories. Himself another cultured, pacifist, loving young man, Adrien seeks out Frantz's grave and family to seek forgiveness for having killed him, albeit in the trenches. As he is so much like Frantz he wins over Anna and Frantz's parents and in turn becomes properly enamoured with her. Though Frantz and Adrien only met in that fatal trench, the narrative posits them as potentially dear friends, perhaps even lovers. That potential was dashed by the war.Adrien's relationship with Anna is based on his lie: that he was Frantz's dear friend, not his killer. When he tells Anna that truth she hides it from Frantz's parents, to spare them further pain and disillusionment. They cling to the illusion he will replace their son by marrying Anna and reviving Frantz' violin. To preserve their illusion Anna stays in Paris and reports living with Adrien. In a sane world Frantz and Adrien would have lived the lie to which Adrien retreated: they would have met in Paris and become fast friends. They might've competed for Anna on an equal footing. But not in this world. As Frantz's father reminds his war-mongering compatriots, fathers send their sons off to war. Though the nations blame each other, it's the fathers' responsibility when the lads are killed. The film's most obvious theme is how war needlessly fractures the brotherhood of man. After the war the Germans still hate the French, the victorious French the Germans. The hatred renews itself. Set in 1919, the entire drama of renewal and loss plays out under our knowledge that WW II lies ahead. The German discontent and French complacency will shortly reignite with even more catastrophic consequences. If Frantz shadows the scene from the past, the next war looms in the future.In addition to war, the film is about the equally difficult issues of how to live a full and honourable life. In peace as in war we're challenged to balance truthfulness with the empathetic lie. Thus Anna tells Adrien she has revealed his lie and guilt to the Hofmeisters. But she hasn't, preferring to save them the renewed pain and another disillusionment. To the end she sustains their illusion that she is living a full life in Paris with Adrien, not wasting away in grief for their Frantz. Where Adrien's lie served himself, hers serves them.The last scene promises a happy ending, her lie coming true, when she meets another version of Adrien, a fragile lookalike, in the Louvre. As young men on either side are interchangeable as cannon fodder in the war, young men can replace each other in civilian life when their mothers send them off to marriage. Tragically, Adrien doesn't resist his mother's assignment of Fanny, as Frantz couldn't resist his father's dispatch to war. But with the spirit of life a heart can survive death and loss. A new love can replace a lost. Until the next war, of course, which could well make her a widow, him a casualty.But that may be the film's most compelling theme: the importance of carrying on with hope and life. Hofmeister means master of hope. Through their mutual attraction Anna and Adrien snap each other out of their emotional paralysis, whether from guilt or grief. They bring each other to life. But as any war story inevitably requires compromise here they can't have each other. They have to settle for other mates. From Frantz letter on to the visits to the Louvre, the film returns to the Manet painting, The Suicide. A pallid thin man flings back across the bed dead, evoking both Frantz and Adrien — and Anna, who tried to drown herself after losing her illusion of Adrien too. In Manet's image off a despairing passionate death Anna finds encouragement to live.One of the film's strengths is its detailed realization of the period, not just in setting and costume but in conversation, tone, values and understanding. Especially in the black and white sequences, the film feels like a document of the 1920s, the period between the great, the terrible, wars. The periodic suffusions of colour serve two functions: they provide an emotional heightening to those particular scenes and they remind us that the film is as much about today as about its historical setting. Perhaps today the bloody fractures involve different nations, and different cultures at war within any of our present nations. But the dashing of hopes and fidelities continues."
" A merited yet unfulfilled pledge
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,5,"The Good: Strong, unyielding performances were to be enjoyed by all - especially the ladies, and even more particular, Cyrielle Claire who graces our screens for mere minutes but still manages to demand our admiration all the same. The cinematography, in parts, is tremendous, with beautiful, natural backdrops and framing worthy of a master. The film starts off strong and with great promise; endless possibilities are spread before us, my expectations are rising, my excitement bubbling.The Bad: The chosen music, albeit... atmospheric, is wholly unjust to the paired scenes, managing nothing more than to yank me right out of the fable's truth and set my mentality on murder-mystery film noir -- which 'Frantz' is not. On top of that, the pacing is all over the place. With the narrative circling itself around symbolic details and rushing past what needed to be a solid foundation for the supposed plot twists, we are being left with a hammered in, fatigued story, screaming out implausibility and limp emotive manhandling.The Ugly: Somewhere in there, the potential for two really good movies withers away; two good movies we'll never get to see. Instead, we get a discordant approach towards presenting the expected in an unexpected way, with the pursuit focused on a subtly clever and stylish roundup where it should be driving to adequately relate and resonate with the viewer on a sentimental level.My disappointment: Loss, sorrow, nostalgia, pain, grief, loneliness... I understand the need to develop a thematic tight bound that aims to impress; it's the ever-present creative strive for 'more', always there, always scratching away at the confines of any artist's imagination. But these are topics that don't always need to be brushed clean with refinement.Borrowing and reapplying the words of T S Eliot, sometimes one's world ends ""not with a bang but a whimper"".And that's okay."
" I love the change of Ozon
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,8,"I am a big fan of Ozon. To me, watching his movie feels like there is always a dagger underneath the pictures, in a stunning and good way. Frantz changed my whole ideas about him, I love his changes. Have you ever seen those Chinese paper cut before? They use scissors to create all wonderful flowers and animals from red papers. It is fragile, beautiful, your heart will go with the sharp edges and afraid the damages might happen. To me , this whole new 'Scissor' feelings of Ozon's movie is way more deeper and exciting than his old 'dagger' skills. The dagger is exciting and thrill, yet scissor brings more possibility.I love the use of Korsakov's 'Scheherazade' in the movie. Scheherazade is trying to escape horrible killing might happened by telling colourful stories to the king. Using pretty stuff to escape the horrible reality might be the biggest achievement of arts. Even it is a painting about death."
