" A beautiful story about painfully real people
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,7,"It's a sad world we live in. A world where such a sad and beautiful story, full of acting genius and human feeling gets a 6.1 by an ever-action-craving audience...
If you love the art of cinema, please watch this one."
" Odd Sort of Movie...Good but Odd..
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,"It sort of reminds me of a David Lynch or Coen Brothers movie...only sort of (probably because it's John Turturro) It's well shot, well acted and just sort of a dark story...grey rather than macabre. Nothing much happens and the pace is slow but it works nicely. I enjoyed it."
" A dark Drama/Comedy w/PSH
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,8,"Once I realized this was a very dark comedy about three quarters of the way through, I enjoyed it even more than I had been up that point. I'm going to methodically make my way through Hoffman's films and this one (which I'd never seen) was a great place to start. His Mickey Scarpato in this film couldn't be any more different from Phil Parma in Magnolia (my favorite of his roles), and he's fantastic. Great performances also from Christina Hendricks, Richard Jenkins, John Turturro, Eddie Marsan, and--in just a few short scenes--Caleb Landry Jones continues to impress me with how well he plays ""awful."""
" Wrongly listed
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,10,"I think the low ratings come from this film being listed as ""drama, crime"". In reality, it is a black comedy. It is superbly acted, and from the middle it gets weirder and funnier. Also, because the first half is less funny and does look a bit depressing, I suspect some viewers do not bother to watch the whole film, turning it off in the middle. Pity. Or they do not understand/like black comedy. I laughed a lot!"
" Offbeat and rather slow
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,6,I'm a big fan of Seymour Hoffman and Jenkins but even they can't make this a memorable film.It's ok and gritty but you have to be in the right frame of mind. It won't make you happy that's for sure.
" Quirky and amusing low-key black comedy
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Hapless blue collar zhlub Mickey Scarpato (an excellent world-weary performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman) tries to quietly take car of business after his obnoxious stepson Leon (a memorably detestable cameo by Caleb Landry Jones) dies in a suspicious ""accident."" However, complications ensue when Mickey doesn't have enough money to pay for Leon's funeral, his grief-stricken wife Jeanie (a fine forlorn portrayal by Christina Hendricks) demands to know the truth about her son's death, and burnt-out alcoholic reporter Richard Shellburn (ably played to the smug hilt by Richard Jenkins) comes snooping around in search of a scoop.Director John Slattery, who also co-wrote the barbed script with Alex Metcalf, relates the engrossingly sordid story at a deliberate pace, vividly captures the bleak and stifling atmosphere of a suffocatingly small and hermetic blighted neighborhood where everyone knows everyone else's business, presents a colorful array of seedy low-life characters, and tops everything off with a wickedly funny sense of dry pitch-black humor. This film's key triumph is the artful way the edgy idiosyncratic tone hovers precariously between beingly grimly serious and darkly amusing throughout. This movie further benefits from ace acting from a tip-top cast, with especially stand-out contributions from John Turturro as hard-luck gambling addict Arthur ""Bird"" Capezio, Eddie Marsan as greedy undertaker Smilin' Jack Moran, Peter Gerety as no-nonsense bartender McKenna, Joyce Van Patten as the feisty Aunt Sophie, and Domenick Lombardozzi as the brutish Sal Capezio. Both Lance Acord's sharp widescreen cinematography and Nathan Larson's spare bluesy score are up to par. A nicely out of the ordinary sleeper."
" Does for the blue-collar working man (and woman) what ""Jaws"" did for sharks.
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,7,"Let's get it right out in the open. There's a good chance you're going to feel dirty after watching this film. I'm not a blue-collar worker personally, although I did some blue-collar stuff when I was a lot younger. I can't say if ""God's Pocket"" paints a true picture of ""blue-collar"" America, but it is certainly an unappetizing one. There is only one attractive character in this film, and that is Christina Hendricks. When I say attractive, I'm only talking about her in-your-face obvious physical attributes. She sticks out like a lone bright red rose erupting in full-bloom from an otherwise overwhelmingly grey and monstrous apocalyptic battlefield. Otherwise, everyone, and I pretty much mean everyone, is downright physically ugly, while Hendricks is, for lack of any other words at this moment, rapturously beautiful. (I suppose I should mention that there is also a brief and blatantly gratuitous scene featuring a hot, young, topless, nameless, and extremely mercenary recent female college grad.) Frankly, Hendricks stunning looks just seem weird, grossly unrealistic, and totally out-of-place. Her appearance is a constant distraction that never really lets you ""suspend disbelief"" while watching this film. (I mean really, you'd think she's got some unseen Hollywood stylist slaving over her behind the scenes somewhere while she's living this hand-to-mouth, lower-class existence. Maybe always looking exceptionally come-hither regardless of any plot is a mandatory clause in her contract.) On the other hand, while Hendricks character's vocabulary is considerably more genteel that others, her personality is little better. ""God's Pocket"" is essentially little more than an atmospheric experience, maybe best described as a slick experimental sort of film. It makes no real point, except that possibly that ""the mass of men live lives of quiet desperation"", a sentiment it just knocks out of the ballpark. For instance, claiming this film was meant to provide insight into the lives of the marginal and less fortunate seems on its face to be ridiculous, since it's basically a ""hate"" letter to them. That'd be like claiming the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was meant to humanize rednecks. In the end, this is a very difficult film to rate. No characters are likable and the story is depressing from beginning to end, but I do feel that it's well-crafted, it held my attention throughout, and it's mercifully short. It's what I'd call ""ugly art"", the merits of which I'll leave it up to others to debate. As for me, I'm off to take a shower in the hopes of feeling clean again."
" Wanna-be coen brothers mess
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,4,"So obviously a first film by an actor who want to direct. Filled with sloppy collages of styles of films he's seen/been in before, zero originality. It's trying REALLY hard to be a quirky coen brothers crime dramedy but fails at both comedy and drama. He even got roger deakins to shoot it so that's an indication of intent. 90% of the time when actors try to be directors it doesn't work. It's somethibg you need to dedicate yourself to fully, just because you've been on films doesn't mean you know how to make them well. Forced myself to watch it for hoffman, Caleb Landry Jones, roger deakins, John turtorro, Richard Jenkins, all of whom have worked with the coen brothers..."
" Well done, darkfunny, and cool.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,9,"A very entertaining movie! Good actors, great story, interesting background. Sarcastic, a good criticism to the society."
" ""You know this never come up before.""
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,8,"This film has all the sensibility and feel of a Coen Brothers picture but without their participation. John Turturro is on hand, an alum of the Coen's from pictures like ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou?"" and ""The Big Lebowski"". He's not as flamboyant a character here, rather portraying someone from the seamy side of life, in league with equally unsavory friend and partner Mickey Scarpato (Philip Seymour Hoffman). I don't think I've ever seen Hoffman in a poor film, or even a poor role, and it's a shame that he passed on much before his time. The story takes on the dimensions of outlandish unintended consequences, so if you go for the quirky and unexpected, you might find this entertaining in a darkly humorous sort of way.The thing that really caught my attention in the movie, apart from a story in which a corpse is routinely mishandled, was that scene in the flower shop when Aunt Sophie (Joyce Van Patten) casually pulled a gun on a pair of mob thugs and proceeded to blow them away, throwing Turturro's character into a spasm of incredulity. I kind of felt like him myself, what with the brutal absurdity of it all. Capping off that gesture, she nonchalantly picks up the phone to call the police with a robbery in progress report. That was just classic.A couple things however took me out of the picture for a few minutes. The sad sack portrayal of newspaper reporter Richard Shellburn (Richard Jenkins) was credible enough, but you couldn't convince me that a good looking journalism grad would come on to the guy the way she did to prostitute herself for a job, and the manner in which he seduced Mickey's busty wife Jeanie (Christina Hendricks) just didn't pass the smell test. I could more easily believe that Mickey would drive around with his dead stepson's body in the back of a refrigerated truck than have this sixty year old codger taking up with women more than half his age. But how, why, what, come on - why was Leon's (Caleb Landry Jones) corpse lying in an alley behind the funeral parlor in the first place?So the title refers to a small neighborhood community in Philadelphia that treats outsiders like the plague, which goes a long way to explain Shellburn's treatment at the hands of the saloon crowd near the end of the story. Even Mickey's intervention, an adopted outsider himself, couldn't stem the tide directed at the unfortunate reporter who dipped his toe too far into the waters of a community that wanted to be left alone. I can't imagine that the repercussions of all that happened wouldn't have continued beyond the closing credits, but taken at face value, all the usual suspects managed to get away with this one pretty much scot-free."
" Grunge Realism
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Cast of truly unlikeable characters makes this difficult to really like but it has very strong actors in the roles and a grunge realism that is created perfectly by director Slattery. Portrays ambiguity of people. More comedic touches would have helped. A sweet-as-pie deadly sharp shooting florist, a truckload of meat that can't be given away, a body that doesn't stay still, etc., would have been comedy gold in any other movie. Running time: only 80 mins."
" THAT'S WHAT I SAW TOO. WHAT HE SAID.
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,7,"Leon (Caleb Landry Jones) is not a very likeable young man. He is killed after he pulls a knife on a worker and insults him. Everyone saw he was murdered, yet everyone saw an industrial accident. His mother Jeanie (Christina Hendricks) believes something is wrong. Her husband Mickey (Philip Seymour Hoffman) thinks so too, but is distracted by his ""side"" businesses and gambling.The story centers on a small community known as ""God's Pocket"" a small sector of the city where everybody knows everything about everyone within the neighborhood. They don't like outsiders.Philip Seymour Hoffman once again shines in the third movie that he has made since he died. He will be in two more. (David Carradine did nine.) The film was a comedy at times, but was mostly a tragedy. I think those who would simply call it a dark comedy are smug individuals who have never lived in a working class community. You know the same people who looked down and laughed at the characters in ""Jack Goes Boating."" They need to be pummeled. (A little blue-collared dark humor inspired from the film.)The film is character driven (not much action or plot) but is more about the character of a community than individuals. I would really like to see less of Philip Seymour Hoffman having sex, although not as bad as ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.""Worth a rental. Good performances by what appears to be type casting.Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity."
" Not what I expected
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,6,"The movie description on Showtime reads ""a small town man tries to hide the fact that he's responsible for the death of his stepson in a construction accident"" . That's not at all the story!!!! I went ahead and watched because of the excellent actors, PSHoffman, Richard Jenkins, John Turturro, Eddie Marsan, and a few others. What a bunch of unexpected events! There was some drama, some comedy, and an all out strange ending. I enjoyed this movie and would recommend to others to check it out."
" Felt Rushed, Plot Holes
",2017-12-07 00:00:00,5,"This movie could have been something special. It was well cast, the plot was quirky and clever(at times), and the characters felt organic - like they belonged in 'God's Pocket'. It was definitely entertaining, and the story engaging, but it felt a bit rushed. I think the movie could have gone on another 25 minutes or so.There were also some serious plot holes. I won't spoil any details, but some characters' motivations made little sense, or COULD have made sense had they been given a bit more development. It all felt so unnatural at times. I can't speak for how faithful the movie is to the novel, but I don't imagine the author forcing things along that quickly unless it was a 150 page book aimed at a teenage audience...It screamed low budget at times, with modern vehicles abundant throughout (I think it was supposed to be the 70s/80s). Some fight scenes were incredibly cheesy as well, where a punch clearly misses, but renders the victim unconscious. Granted, these weren't major parts of the plot, but it might be distracting depending on how observant you are.5/10. Hoffman/Turturro were good as you'd expect, and it was definitely entertaining, but not something I'd recommend to a film buff."
" Like a Bukowski poem set to music...
",2017-11-09 00:00:00,6,"Like a Bukowski poem set to music and sung by Tom Waits, a rancid, deep dark comedy of errors in an urban hell. An amazing ensemble of great actors. Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturro, Richard Jenkins, Eddie Marsan and many more of some of the finest drunks and lowlifes you'll see on film. Christina Hendricks, unfortunately, is out of place and out-skilled. The script walks with a limp and probably has a disease."
" Individual Acting Greatness Surrounded by a Forgettable Movie
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed Hoffman, Jenkins, Turturro, etc. at an individual level. I enjoyed the set detail, lighting, and mood created and really felt as if I were having a drink in a Devil's Pocket dive bar in the 80's.The movie as a whole and plot however, were completely forgettable. I was actually quite pleased to see ""Old Lucy"" knock that horrible, racist, knife wielding kid over the head with a pipe. It actually felt like justice as it could be argued the murder was in self- defense and involuntary at its worst.Regardless, from that point on, I could not connect with the plot of Jeanie Scarpato seeking justice. I could not connect with the overly contrived ""feeling"" that Jeanie had about her dirt bag son getting killed as if getting accidentally killed in an industrial yard is completely unbelievable?! Not too mention that the rest of the film felt disjointed, without purpose and lacking in realism.At the end of the movie, I felt A) glad it was over and B) disappointment that we won't see Hoffman's incredible talent for acting again."
" Superb film, outstanding acting, writing and directing
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"I've just watched this again a couple of years after my first viewing. This time I feel I must do the movie justice by writing a review.This is an absolute gem, almost poetical in its description of the working-class neighbourhood of God's Pocket. The film shows the events following a death and in that showing describes the lives of the people. Those lives are also examined by an outsider, an ageing and world-weary reporter, who is given to drinking too much and finds his libido drawing him too deeply into the world of which he is writing.At the heart of the story are Mickey and Jeanie Scarpato portrayed to perfection by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Christina Hendricks. It is the death of their highly unpleasant son that sets the plot in motion which rolls inexorably towards its close taking in moments of tragedy, high comedy and pathos on its route.In sum a beautifully conceived and realized movie which among much else drives home to us all just how much the incredibly talented Philip Seymour Hoffman will be missed."
" Another arty film that isn't as worthy or important as it thinks it is
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,2,"When their son is killed during a construction accident, his parents Mickey Scarpato (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Jeanie Scarpato (Christina Hendricks) react to his death in different ways; Jeanie is understandably distraught by her son's death and believes that her son's death was no accident and is determined to find out the truth and enlists the help of journalist Richard Shellburn (Richard Jenkins). Mickey is much more indifferent and is more concerned with trying to deal with his own problems whilst simultaneously trying, but ultimately failing to appease his wife.You only have to look at the screenplay for this film to fully comprehend this utter mess that Slattery has put before us...For a start, we have the Scarpato's son Leon who, as far as I can gather, was some kind of off his nut druggie, but it seems that Slattery thinks it's OK to paint him as some sort of lunatic, but then not convey to the audience why he behaves like this? At no point in the film do we get to learn anything about him, why he turned to drugs and why he behaved in this manner? I've said this time and time again and I'll say it again; if I'm given no reason to give a damn about characters then I won't give a damn and this will usually ruin a film for me.The same thing can be said about Mickey; he's in with a bad lot and seems to racks up huge debts, but again Slattery fails to develop him as a character and we don't really learn anything about him which again left me feeling rather indifferent to him as a character. That's the big problem with this film in that it is filled with a whole host of sleazy and unlikeable characters, but they're sleazy and unlikeable characters who we're not able to understand and that ultimately makes the film hard to sit through. The only person that it's possible to feel some sympathy for is Mickey's wife although some of this sympathy was slightly undone by her indiscretion later in the film.Slattery's screenplay is heavily flawed and vague, but then again so is his directing. The whole film is so drab, boring and lifeless. If it would have had more energy about it then it still would have been flawed, but at least it would have been enjoyable, but as it is it's about as much fun as pulling teeth.The truth is that you don't need this in your life; it isn't profound, it doesn't have much to say, it isn't deep or particularly interesting and is just generally worthless. The best part about this film was the early scenes with Christina Hendricks in all her 'full figured' glory. Yummy!!"
