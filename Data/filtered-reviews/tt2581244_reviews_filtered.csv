" Don't waste your time
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,2,"The movie is not funny nor any horror, it's just plain boring."
" I legit went in with zero expectations and was fully satisfied as if I had.
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,10,"I'm a little late to this party, but in searching for horror comedies to binge on during my downtime, I came upon this masterpiece. Now don't get me wrong here. I'm not gonna let it off the hook with its obvious plot holes and ""wtf"" moments, but I am going to touch on my favorite bits and form a picture of my take from there. Now this will have spoilers, so I've marked it as such.Movie starts off oddly in a wooded trail where we get a glimpse of Plaza's character (Beth) walking aimlessly while texting on her phone. Suddenly the scene cuts and without warning or rhyme/reason, we're at a wake for said character. Complete with mourning family and boyfriend (Zach). Now it's unknown as to how exactly she dies as we never see a scene depicting her death, but the plot alludes to an extremely venomous snake biting her near her groin, as we're shown later, and somehow that sheds her mortal coil entirely. She's buried, Zach mourns. Beth's parents mourn. They mourn together. Zach even becomes chummy with the father as they discuss Beth, her life, etc.This is where the plot gets weird and starts to procure some holes. At some point during all this, somehow a voodoo ritual is conducted by (we assume) Beth's parent's housekeeper, who happens to be haitian, but since we never see the ritual, and the housekeeper leaves the next scene we're given without anything besides a little argument with Beth's folks on the front lawn, we don't exactly know. However, weird things begin happening. People are seen randomly running from something or someone without any given reason as to why. They're clearly in a panic. The mailman (Gerry from Parks and Rec, which is 1 of 2 callbacks to that show that I noticed/caught) is acting strange, driving the mail truck erratically, and gives Zach random mail while maintain and very odd grin. It's right around this point where Beth's parents completely ghost Zach and stop answering the door, or his phone calls.Zach gets frustrated, heads over to the parent's house and snoops around. To his amazement, his formally deceased girlfriend is aimlessly walking around her parent's house as Zach tries desperately to get her attention from outside. Eventually he finds his way in, confronts the parents, reunites with Beth and story kicks off in full swing. Beth's undead character begins to lose touch with her humanity as time goes on, with her only soothing muse being smooth jazz and hikes with Zach. At some point, Zach tells Beth that she's dead which is apparently a big no-no and this act causes the whole town's dead to arise from their graves and begin attacking the townsfolk.Towards the end I really felt bad for Beth. Zach finally agrees to take her on a (final) hike while she's strapped to an entire over on her back just to calm her down. It's at this point Zach makes the decision to kill Beth to save his conscience, and her soul. I will say that due to my massive crush on Plaza, this drew a single tear since he starts saying his goodbyes to her, while she's unaware of what's going on or about to happen. When he final concludes, she begins to panic as she thinks he's leaving her, so she starts to look around, slightly blinded by her affliction with the last bit of her humanity asking ""where are you going! don't leave me!"" as he draws a pistol and blows her head off. Her body then tumbles down a cliff face complete with oven still attached... dismembering her the whole way down. The story basically wraps up there, and while we're still not sure who performed the ritual to bring back Beth as the housekeeper is never found. We're not sure what these random people were running from, but we're left to assume it's Beth fresh from her forever nap. We're also never shown this extremely fatal snake, and why a girl with a cellphone and affinity for hiking doesn't have gameplan in place for such a catastrophe. It's a solid movie though. If you're a fan of Plaza and her Parks and Rec character, you'll probably enjoy this. The second callback to P&R happens after Zach breaks up with Zombie Beth and she picks up the phone and starts trying to call someone. When asked who she's calling, she replies with ""Andy... he cares about me"" implying that she has a close connection with a dude named Andy and this gives me the impression she's talking about Andy Dwyer from P&R. Obviously not the same universe here, but it was fun to see her throw that in.I gave it a 10 which isn't a popular score here, but it was an innovative way to tell a zombie romcom and I appreciated it."
" Not perfect but has its funny moments
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,"I found this film to be funny at times and enjoyable. It is basically an inferior version of Warm Bodies. The two main characters Beth and Zach were good. Dane DeHaan nailed the ""edgy"" teen who became depressed once his girlfriend died. Aubrey Plaza was funny at times too, especially later in the movie when she had to change up her behaviour. John C Reilly was his usual self although at times I felt the writing or acting was a bit too much. He ended up taking away some ample scenes where other characters could have been developed to a greater extent. Matthew Gray Gubler (Spencer from Criminal Minds) was hilarious as the security guard gun happy brother and he was a clear standout from the minor characters. Cheryl Hines was kind of wasted in my opinion and Molly Shannon could have done more if her scenes were not dominated by John C Reilly. She got better towards the end when she had this disturbing, yet touching scene with her daughter Beth and Zach. I also wish Anna Kendrick had a few more scenes as the few she was in were well done.This was meant as a movie that you do not take very seriously and it accomplishes that most of the time. I had a great time watching it with family and while not all of the jokes or humour land, most of it does hit. If you like more comedic horror films or enjoyed Warm Bodies you should watch this movie. 7/10"
" Spot on
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,4,Aubrey Plaza just nailed the role. Never realized she is so tallented
" Just Not Interesting
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,4,"The title kind of says it all. I'm an Aubrey Plaza fan and I liked the premise of the movie, but I just couldn't get into it. The comedy was forced, the plot was confusing, and I just didn't enjoy the ride."
" Dark take on romantic comedies
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,8,"I don't think you realize how lucky the main male character is. This man makes out with Aubrey Plaza multiple times throughout the film and living the damn dream.That being said, there is a lot of raunch and suspense at the same time. There is multiple cuss words throughout."
" Came for Gubler, Stayed for Weirdness
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,6,"I don't usually go for zombie movies, but this was a fun horror comedy with a number of creative and amusing elements. Perfect role for Aubrey Plaza. And then Matthew Gray Gubler was the cherry on top!"
" Hard To Tell Whether Alive or Dead
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,4,"A couple things I appreciate about the late TV series ""Parks and Recreation""--at least, after its first floundering season or so--are the consistent comedic tone and ""The Simpsons"" like sense of community with zany characterizations of the townsfolk and place. ""Life After Beth"" has none of this, although it desperately needed to. Not until the last act is there finally some amusing anarchy and gore. The narrative involves the dead returning dazed to the communities they lived and the street-by-street battle with these zombies, but besides Beth we never get a good sense of characters and the places they inhabit. The most consistent thing here may be the references to ""Parks & Rec,"" which also starred Aubrey Plaza. A talented cast of comedians overall is wasted.To nit pick, I'm also disappointed by the characterization of zombies. Early on, there's some ambiguity as to what the dead are, and we never get an explanation for their being--although a decent joke is made of a prejudice against Haitians and Voodoo (followed by an odder one involving the middle-aged exposing themselves in front of younger adults or teenagers). It seemed as though Beth was also meant to be considered possibly a vampire, as well as maybe other such ghouls. She burns under sunlight and her parents insist she only travel at night, after all, and something could've been made of her mother taking photographs of her. Instead of a preference for coffins, though, we get attics... and smooth jazz. Plus, there was Beth's lust; sex being strongly associated with vamps even before Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" was adapted to the screen. Usually, sex is not associated with zombies, though. As with everything else in ""Life After Beth,"" the depiction of the undead is uneven--not entirely dead, but it never comes to life, either."
" Rom-zom
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"This movie is more of a love story than anything. The humor fell in place naturally as the love story unfolds as the bizarre zombie apocalypse. If you like rom-com's with a splash of zombie, you'll be thoroughly entertained. This move is also about letting go and second chances. I thought every character had depth and the actors were brilliant."
" New type of zombie comedy
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,6,New type of zombie comedy that has its moments just don't expect there to be a lot of them.
" Oh Beth what can I do?
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,4,"There's a scene in Life After Beth where Zach Orfman (Dane DeHaan) goes hiking with his pretty girlfriend Beth (Aubrey Plaza). Nothing unusual about that, you might think, except that Beth is a zombie, has an oven chained to her back, and is listening to smooth jazz. This isn't your run-of-the-mill zombie flick.The film starts as Zach attends Beth's wake, the girl having died of a snakebite while out walking. Struggling to come to terms with his loss, the young man befriends his dead girlfriend's parents, Maury (John C. Reilly) and Geenie (Molly Shannon), but is understandably confused when they suddenly shut him out of their lives. Curious, Zach investigates and learns that Beth has somehow returned home, seemingly alive and well. Rekindling his romance with the girl, despite the fact that she was pronounced dead and subsequently buried, Zach becomes increasingly concerned about Beth's erratic and sometimes violent behaviour, and becomes convinced that she is a zombie.This one is often referred to as a horror comedy, but I found nothing horrific or funny about it. It's more of a romantic drama between two young lovers where the girl just happens to be a corpse. The situation is far from amusing, and even after the film enters apocalyptic/survival mode, there's little that could be described as horrific. Dealing with the subjects of grief and troubled relationships, this is actually quite a downer of a film, especially at the end when Beth goes full-on flesh-eater and Zach is forced to end the relationship once and for all.It's an admirable attempt to do something different with the zombie genre, but I can't say that it succeeds, the plot going nowhere interesting after introducing its basic premise. It doesn't have anything profound to say about humanity, it doesn't force the viewer to reflect on their own relationships, and it doesn't feature any insightful social commentary. It doesn't even offer up any gore."
" Glad I stumbled upon this movie!
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,9,"Life after Beth has awesome actors, love, laughs, chaos, and zombies. It's NOT a horror movie. My husband and I really enjoyed this film. It's a hidden gem of a movie with a unique spin on ""zombie comedies"". If you don't go into the movie with expectations of another Zombieland or Night of the Living Dead, you might just enjoy it as much as we did!"
" almost
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,6,"Recently I wondered, what else did that guy who wrote I Heart Huckabees do? Turns out a decade later he started writing and directing movies. They all had middling IMDB ratings, but one had an interesting premise and starred the always-entertaining Aubrey Plaza, so I watched that one.The story begins with the death of Beth;. Most of the first half hour is a melancholy slog through boyfriend Zach's mourning process, which involves sitting around or hanging out with her parents. Then her parents stop talking to him and he peeks through their window and sees ... Beth!Plaza plays Beth, and she fully commits to a portrayal that gets stranger and stranger. She's quite good, but this is more Beth's movie than Zach's. Dane DeHaan plays Zach as a bland everyman, and the things you want from a lead, like personality or personal growth, are sadly missing.Still, the story is generally interesting as events ramp up, and there are good moments. If you push through the tedious beginning, it's a reasonably entertaining movie that suffers from poor pacing and a weak lead.The last half hour is the craziest part, but by the end it feels like not enough has happened to justify a movie. The movie would have worked better if Zach had learned something from it all. Alternately, the movie would have worked better if the script were the first half of something that got really, really crazy by the end. Instead, it's all rather underwhelming.The movie makes one wonder if writer-director Baen could have pulled off I Heart Huckabees. As a director he's workmanlike, and based on Life After Beth I wonder if perhaps those who worked on the film with him helped make a better movie than existed on paper. Because Life After Beth seems like a rather lazy movie.I don't really have a recommendation on this one. It's entertaining more often than not, and sometimes quite funny. Plaza is quite good, as is Matthew Gray Gubler as Zach's hyped-up brother. Yet at the end it feels like a ramble to nowhere."
" Very bad.
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,1,By far one of the worst movies I've ever seen.. So boringly unfunny.
" Quirky, off beat and falling in between genres. Original fresh take on the zombie genre. BEST suited for those who usually never watch zombie movies.
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,8,"Beware: this movie is NOT suited for (die hard) zombie fans, although it is (wrongly) marketed as a zombie movie.The zombie fans didnt get what they expected and they started complaining about it on Imdb. But that doesnt make this movie a bad movie, not at all.This movie is probably better suited for an arthouse audience who appreciates SERIOUS acting above gross action scenes. Life after Beth is basically a slowburning, quirky romantic comedy about Dane DeHaan, who is dating a girlfriend (Aubrey Plaza, those eyes! ) who has died, although she doesnt realize it yet. The many practical difficulties of dating a girlfriend, who has died and who immediately has come back to life, is what makes this movie quite witty and original.It is not a full blown comedy though, because acting and story (up to a point) are mostly done seriously. But serious acting performances only enhance the comedy effect, in a tongue in cheek kinda way. Great supporting actor roles as well!Any bad? The start of this story is great. But later on the movie is lacking a bit in suspense and drama, because it has become more of a predictable action / zombie story, although the dramatic end part of this movie is rather good again. 8 stars for originality of the story and 8 stars for the quirky kind of humour, which is quite delightful!"
" A quirky premise isn't enough to carry an entire film
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,4,"A boyfriend unsuccessfully copes with his girlfriend's passing and resurrection during a zombie outbreak in Life After Beth (2014). Written and directed by Jeff Baena, this comedy-horror manages to be neither terrifying nor funny. Life After Beth has its moments, but its poorly thought out horror elements interrupt and undermine what could have otherwise been an interesting exploration of love, loss, and regret, and the importance of letting go.Young Zach Orfman (Dane DeHaan) is devastated when his girlfriend, Beth Slocum (Aubrey Plaza), dies from a snakebite. His parents, Noah (Paul Reiser) and Judy (Cheryl Hines), urge him to move on. Zach becomes suspicious to the point of paranoia when Beth's parents, Maury (John C. Reilly) and Geenie (Molly Shannon), abruptly stop speaking with him and cloister themselves in their home.Things get complicated when Zach discovers Beth has returned from the dead. Her parents consider it a miracle, but Zach just can't accept the new status quo. Beth's strange behavior, as well as the appearance of other long-dead people from his past, has him asking questions. His testosterone-fueled brother, Kyle (Matthew Gray Gubler), springs into action as the zombie apocalypse unfolds. Can Zach discover a cure for the zombie outbreak and save his lost love?An interesting premise and talented cast weren't enough to save Life After Beth from lousy writing and direction. I understand Zach's struggle with loss and letting go of his girlfriend is the film's central conflict, but that doesn't give the horror elements a pass. World building is important in any zombie film. Why are the dead coming back to life? What do they want? Is there a cure? How can they be stopped? None of these questions are answered in its 89-minute runtime.Beth's parents urge Zach to accept the miracle and not worry about why Beth has returned from the dead (perhaps as a message for the audience). But Zach rejects their advice and looks for an explanation. His efforts ultimately lead to a dead end. The zombies' strange behavior, like nesting in attics and being soothed by elevator music, likewise go unexplained. Why include these elements at all if they serve no purpose? I found myself more frustrated than entertained.Casting was a mixed bag as well. Aubrey Plaza is perfect for this type of role. Dane DeHaan was actually sympathetic and relatable and not as creepy or reptilian as he was in Valerian and The City of a Thousand Planets or A Cure for Wellness. Once again, Molly Shannon and John C. Reilly play awkward adults in a Jeff Baena film. It didn't work in The Little Hours and it doesn't work here. Not sure the rationale behind casting top tier comedians in secondary roles that don't play to their strengths.Life After Beth is comparable to the zombie-romance film Warm Bodies (2013), which was released a year earlier and was better in almost every way. Warm Bodies' exploration of its characters' relationships connected with audiences, while the zombie elements complimented-rather than distracted from-its story. Perhaps Warm Bodies shows what Life After Beth could have been with a larger budget, but its director, Jonathan Levine, had a comparable level of experience with Jeff Baena at the time.The blame for Life After Beth's failure lands squarely at its writer/director's feet, and I'm surprised any studio green lit another Jeff Baena film after this disaster. Life After Beth made $88,000 on a budget of $2.4 million. Yikes. You might as well flush money down the toilet. This was a rare occurrence when critics and audiences were in agreement, with a 44 percent critic rating and abysmal 30 percent audience rating on RottenTomatoes, proving once again that you need more than a quirky concept and a well-known cast to make a good film."
" Bored AF
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,1,"Trust me you would never want to see this movie.If u wanna torture some one, try this movie and make him watch till the end."
" Nothing says Lovin' like hiking with an oven
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,5,"I was confused at first; not knowing this was a zombie movie. So it didn't hit me between the eyes at first. More ""what the hell is going on?"" Bit by bit all is revealed. Best quip from our audience of 7 was ""Nothing says Lovin' like hiking with an oven."" from Todd Searing."
" Outside the box
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,10,"This is a horror comedy. Except, it's not. People who expect the usual mix of jump scares and laughs from this movie end up most disappointed. It's a love story with zombies. But not a happy one like Warm Bodies. Much more sad and dramatic. And humor is much more dry and subtle. Unfortunately, people who sit down to watch a zombie comedy do not really expect subtle. And people who want subtle do not look into zombie comedies. This is why this little gem is one of the most underrated movies on IMDB. Watch it without expectations and you might enjoy it much more."
" MONSTERS IN THE ATTIC
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,8,"Beth (Aubrey Plaza) dies and leaves us with her grieving family and boyfriend Zach (Dane DeHaan). However it isn't long before Beth digs herself out of the grave to return home not knowing she was dead. Her parents attempt to keep her hidden, but Zach soon finds out. The decay process hasn't halted as Beth's mind also shows signs of failing.This was an interesting take on the zombie genre. There were numerous humorous moments in this dark comedy as well as missed opportunities. Beth played the zombie aspect with decaying brain function very well. There were many unexplained aspects like why zombies like to be in attics or what caused the incident in the first place, or why everyone hates light jazz but listens to it.I found the film amusing, but not a side splitter.Parental Guide: F-bomb. Zombie Nudity (Bonnie Burroughs)"
" So much potential, squandered.
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,3,"I sat through a good half hour of this movie thinking that there would be some crazy twist, like the main protagonist is having a mental break and the dead people he's seeing are just an extension of his mind. That would have been WAY more interesting than ""Oh no, they are actually supposed to be zombies and this stuff is really supposed to be happening"" - honestly it was so much so that I sort of think they got halfway through it, decided to take the plot in a more zaney way, and lost track of what the story was supposed to be about. I'm guessing whatever the script originally was got side-lined because of the popularity of other movies that came out around this time; which is a real shame because the 'protagonist losing their mind and can't tell reality from fantasy' is, while slightly hackneyed, a lot more interesting than 'oh I guess I'm like a zombie now, lol'Quite disappointing since they had an all-star, painfully underutilized cast that really could have made this a great movie, but instead we get this wishy-washy, self indulgent nonsense. Part of me feels like this movie was only made so that the protagonist could make out with Aubrey Plaza. It's absolutely amazing that these actors would even put their name on this, but I guess the money was right- too bad they didn't make it back at the Box Office, with their revenue only being a meager 10% of what they spent making it. All you need to do is watch it to figure out why. This movie was so bad I made an imdb account to advise people against wasting time on this. Not even John C. Reilly could prevent this train from wrecking."
" Loved it
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,10,"I have no idea how the ratings aren't higher. Dane DeHaan is amazing as always. The comedy is dry and quirky. It definitely fits the dark comedy genre. A ridiculous, sweet, and surprising zombie movie."
" A Horror Comedy with a difference. Not scary and not funny.
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,3,"One of the most boring films I've seen in a long time. The director has tried to be clever and tried to do something different but ended up doing literally nothing with it.I'm not even sure what category I would put this film in, it's certainly not horror and certainly not comedy.It has a good cast but very very poor delivery."
" Idiotic
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,2,"This movie started interestingly but as time progresses it became stupider and stupider.
I was told it is a 'Zom Com' movie.
Zom= Zombie+Romance, Com=Comedy
Well, at no point I found this movie to be funny. It was boring all along. I would advise you to not watch it. You won't miss anything"
" Bizarre but fun take on the genre
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,7,"At first I thought this was interesting, then strange, then really funny, then finally heart warming."
" Movie that completely destroyed its potential
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,2,"This movie started off as a promising one. As it progressed, you would already know its base story-line, but that isn't a bad thing itself. It could have become a typical zombie movie with its thrills and all. If done right, still great to see, as always. But you start noticing this is actually a comedy. The 2nd half of the movie completely turns the whole thing upside down to a full-on comedy that was not even funny. That's a big disappointment and you actually don't want to watch anymore but still sit through it anyway. It goes like this throughout the entire 2nd half of the movie. No content at all. Even though the 1st half was promising and set up a great foundation for a good movie. Also because the actors were great and the setting and refinements of the movie by general were all good."
