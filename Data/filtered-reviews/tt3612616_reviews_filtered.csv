" Beavis and Butthead in real life.
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,4,"While it is a very arty film, it's too barebones and plain annoying. I did love the soundtrack, those musical scenes are awesome, but the characters are very unlikable. This film is shot in 1:1 aspect ratio which is just painful to look at. The screen is so small I can barely see anything in it. It is supposed to make us more focused on the characters instead of background, but I think that it's a terrible trade off. The ending is so ambiguous and just feels plain unfinnished the story is cut too soon."
" Couldn't watch
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,1,Had to stop after 2 minutes couldn't stand the french. It's like a bunch of lost American tourists speaking French. Horrendous!
" Beautiful Emotional Rollercoaster.
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,10,"This is hands-down probably one of my top five favourite films I've ever seen director Xavier Dolan, portrays just about every emotion you can think of into this movie and makes it come together as a whole to express the magic of friendship, hope, and how much strength it can impact one's will to overcome life's hardest difficulties."
" Born to Die...
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,"""Mommy"" is a 2014 French-Canadian film directed by Xavier Dolan starring Anne Dorval and Antoine Olivier Pilon.
⚪
All in all, Canadian director Xavier Dolan brought an utterly intense and shocking family drama in this world that simultaneously amazes and astonishes with its sheer narrative intensity, and even if it is a dramatic story in its core, it surprisingly displays a dazzling emotional range, going from gracious to ferocious in the matter of seconds most of the time, and thanks to intelligently used and sensitive cinematography, outstandingly portrayed and written characters as well as fitting soundtrack, it becomes an utterly intriguing, equally fascinating and harrowing rollercoaster ride that convinces with its brutal realism and merciless emotiveness.
⚪
Because it was the birthday of my buddy, the outstanding @officialnerdhub, I decided to make him a small present by watching one of his favourite films of all time, and since both ""Interstellar"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" simply run for too long for a Friday night and I have watched ""The Shining"" recently, the winner was Canadian director Xavier Dolan's most praised drama ""Mommy"" - and holy hell, what an incredible film it was. It once again proved to me that there are several masterful films out there many apparently haven't seen this far, simply because they are in a foreign language, so at this point one small piece of advice: go watch more non-anglophone films. In many cases you will probably end up like me - shattered to the very foundations - because what Dolan has created here is nothing short of outstanding dramatic writing. In a fictional Canada, independent mother Diane ""Die"" Després, tries to raise her seemingly ineducable son Steve, an obnoxious brat suffering from ADHD and violent outburst, and with the help of her mysterious new neighbour Kyla, it all seems to be possible ... at least for a while. This premise is yet another project of which the success of the film depends solely on the execution, because if you don't have a sufficiently sensitive screenplay, capable actors and an empathetic design, it will most definitely fail to unfold its full intensity. Thankfully, this film has got all of it. What makes it so indescribably intriguing is the fact that the film's plot somehow mirrors the emotional world of its protagonist, because if it is per se a drama, it is divided into totally different phases, and each is defined by an entirely different mood. In one scene, verbal and physical fighting takes place in all its ugliness and ferocity, and after that it turns into a calm and optimistic feel-good film. The thing is, this duality is noticeable throughout the entire film, but as predictable as it sounds, it is anything but this, because like violent outbursts, the atmosphere and the nature of the scenes shift in the matter of seconds. Seriously, at first it seems like Die and Steve will get along peacefully, and after a minimal issue, it suddenly turns into a horrifying scene - in one case ending with attempted murder. There is this certain type of discomfort and menace accompanying every single scene, since it is just impossible to tell what is happening next. Only after Kyla, a mysterious woman herself, steps into their life, it becomes comparatively organised. Even though it is factually never mentioned, I think that she has had severe problems in her past herself. She is a teacher on sabbatical, and next to her shyness, she also stutters nervously most of the time - and that makes me conclude that she was most probably bullied and humiliated by students at her old school. I know, it is a long shot, but it would fit perfectly into the context of the story. Anyway, after initial difficulties, Kyla seems to become the only person Steve respects in some abstract way, and a while later, the three become an inseparable trio. Honestly, to a certain point I thought that we would get a happy ending, but what comes after that is just the total opposite of that. Even if he seems to be on the mend, Steve remains a troublemaker, and the things he has done in the past begin to catch up. A major lawsuit forces Die to sweet-talk their neighbour Paul, who happens to be a lawyer, into helping them, but as she succeeds in her undertaking, Steve just cannot deal with it. As it shockingly turns out, he loves his mother more than previously assumed, and even if it was hinted in some occasions, it was still a shocking revelation - next to his hyperactivity and anger issues, he also suffers from an oedipal complex - and then the tragedy is perfect (in a classic Greek way as well). The justified rejection by Die makes Steve think that she doesn't love him anymore, and it all goes downhill from there. Die really wants to save her one and only son, even if he pulls her down. It is a simple yet utterly heart-breaking dilemma, and everything she does would hurt her in some way. It is self-destruction in its rawest form, and I think it couldn't get any more shocking - and I was wrong, once again. After an attempted suicide by Steve, Die decides to commit her son to an institution, and oh my god, this scene packed a punch. After a day-dream sequence depicting how Steve reached his goal, got his life together and eventually married, the bleak reality sets in. Once again, it was this the suddenness of this transition that made it so incredibly excruciating, because after that it is shown how Steve tries to resist the male nurses trying to capture him, and the feelings of betrayal, disappointment and anger written on his face - simply shattering. Subsequently, Die seems to live an easier life, Kyla moves away once again, and everything of the triangular friendship is gone forever - and thus, it ends heartbreakingly. As already mentioned above, what makes this so even more intense are the practical features. Dorval, Pilon and Clément, portraying Die, Steve and Kyla, respectively, are the driving force behind everything. The way they play their respective characters, how they convey their personalities and the connected emotions is downright mesmerising, and that makes it even more heart-breaking. Furthermore, the movie is entirely presented in a 1:1 aspect ratio, and that allows the viewer to experience the emotional intensity even more. Many close-up shots make for this uncomfortable yet ingenious intimacy, and it works out perfectly. However, just as I thought I saw through the meaning behind this unusual creative decision, the screen suddenly widened during the day-dream sequence, and I new that it also emphasises the lack of perspective and the feeling of being narrowed perceived by the characters, and how this all changes only in a figment. In the end, this film turns out to be distressing rollercoaster ride and probably one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. Every little aspect fits perfectly, and it still haunts me as I write those sentences. The soundtrack underlining the end credits, a famous song by Lana Del Rey, was added to my playlist shortly after, and it made me chuckle, because Steve was ""Born To Die"" in more than one way ... and the brilliance of that film increased, once again."
" Sloooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwww
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,3,"One hour of this film should have ended up in the floor of the editing room and then it would have been a great movie. As it is, I struggled to get to the end."
" Did I miss something?
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"I've heard about this movie a few times and finally got round to watching it.
It's not bad or anything but wasn't exactly life changing. I thought the characters were pretty predictable...stroppy confused teen...single mum doing what she can.
Maybe I'm missing something?
Definitely worth checking out but wouldn't hit my top 50. A bit disappointing."
" Decent, artistic, predictable
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,7,"Artistically shot film, charged with emotion and violence. The relationships of the mother and sin really draw you in and you can't help but feel for each character on a deeper level. Throughout the film however leaves little to the imagination and you do somewhat feel like the storyline is absolutely spelled out to you."
" ""Loving people doesn't save them.""
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,9,"The film is aesthetically too beautiful with an analogue footprint, the format of the screen 1:1 talks to the audience representing the feelings of the characters and the scene that plays Wonderwall is breathtakingly beautiful. I intend to re-watch this film in the near future."
" Masterpiece
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,10,"Mommy es una obra de artes, una película hermosa con un guion brutal que no para de golpearte a medida que avanza. Mi película favorita de Dolan."
" Phenomenal
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,10,"I had heard magnificent things about this 2014 film by Xavier Dolan, and I have to say after getting around to see it for myself that all of the praise is justified.""Mommy"" is anchored by three absolutely phenomenal performances by Anne Dorval, Antoine Olivier Pilon, and Suzanne Clement. It tells the story of a mother's fierce and at times borderline inappropriate love for her delinquent son and a shy neighbor with a sketchy past who enters their closed circle and bonds with both of them. Dolan plays around with aspect ratios, filming most of the movie in claustrophobic squares and rectangles, but occasionally and gloriously opening up the frame when the troubled youth's world shows signs of promise. The movie explores the impossible and heartbreaking decisions parents must sometimes make for the sake of their children, and the ending Dolan chooses for each of his characters is emotionally stirring in its own unique way.Grade: A+"
" Very nearly perfection
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,9,"My most recent review was on mother! by Darren Aronofsky so I decided to watch some films with 'mum' related titles. I know, hilarious.Mommy is a thoughtfully presented film and is technically fantastic as well. But what holds the film together in the relationship between the characters, if the relationships were not so ridiculously well written, believable and, again, so thoughtfully presented nothing would work. Fortunately the writing is fantastic and relationships are believable and the presentation is brilliant and unique. Xavier Dolan clearly gave his all and really cared about this film, unfortunately as time goes on more companies are just pumping out movies month after month and I find it insulting to the artists who love and care about what they are making. Disney is the worst example of this, but far from the only one.I mentioned the characters and how they are the integral part of the movie but I want to talk more about this. I knew a kid all through school who had ADHD and acted very similarly to Steve, like Steve he had outbursts of rage and obviously was very hyperactive. Steve is also diagnosed with attachment disorder or RAD. I added a link to what attachment disorder is but I'll give a brief overview if you don't want to read some of the article. RAD is a condition where a child is unable to establish a healthy relationship with their parents or caregivers. This often leads to difficulty connecting with others, trouble managing emotions, fear of getting close to others, lack of trust, lack of self-worth. What I'm getting at is that Steve is portrayed realistically and respectfully, this is absolutely something to admire as most disabilities in films are either extremely exaggerated, or extremely disrespectful. Anne was also a complex and realistic character who made believable decisions which is really important for her character. And finally my favourite character Kyla, I relate so heavily to Kyla as I have confidence issues of my own, I don't think my issues are as severe as Kyla's but she is still portrayed amazingly well. These three phenomenal actors also have really good chemistry on screen together which is important and their performances are some of my favourites, ever.The soundtrack is fantastic and oftentimes a song would start and end in unison with sequences in the film. I found wonderwall a little bit distracting but it's nothing in the grand scheme of things. It fit the scene it was used in just as well as the other songs fit their respective scenes. WhenI don't want this review to drag on but I really want to mention the technical aspects, especially the aspect ratio. Don't be put off by the 1:1 aspect ratio, it serves a purpose, it's not just shot this way for the sake of being artsy. I won't say why it is shot this way because I think you should experience it yourself. The aspect ratio isn't the only brilliant technical element of this film though, it is shot beautifully and the 1:1 gives such an amazing claustrophobic feeling. The editing is great and the production design is as well.The only significant issue I have is text at the start of the film, it was unnecessary, everything could have played out in the same way without this text. I would have preferred if it wasn't there. That is my only issue that holds any weight. Please watch mommy if you can, it's such an amazing, emotional movie that got a proper visceral reaction out of me which doesn't happen all that often."

When you gather top notch directional skills, very good understanding of human's deepest emotions and a bunch of sinceres performances that engrossing, I can only say BRAVO!
And don't even get me started on the cinematography !!"
" Mommy: the most punchy and emotional movie ever.
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,10,"Sometimes love cannot heal completely but it always wins because it is able to heal wounds that can do much harm. It is the story of a boy with attention deficit disorder. After having spent many moments of despair and depression, he is locked up in a psychiatric clinic by his mother, disappointed and saddened by not being able to keep her son at home but stubborn in having him locked up in a structure.
This boy tried in spite of himself to react positively and his dream was to graduate but life perhaps had raged too much on him, especially when a parent takes over the different expectations of a child.
The scene that makes me more serene and gives me a feeling of freedom is the one in which Steve, his mother and their friend dance carefree and sing a piece by Celine Dion. Hence their desire to escape from problems through music. This is the demonstration for which
inner pain can sometimes lead to death especially if you suffer for long years. The freedom to live peacefully and to love should not be denied to people. When you suffer intensely you just want to let off steam and be free and from here I quote the scene in which he turns on himself with a shopping cart and throws it away with determination almost to represent that cart as his rival who is depriving him of his dignity and freedom from all that suffering and all those people's prejudices. There are people like Steve who can never get out of it. Maybe. Yet in all this suffering there is something special about him. There is so much love and lightheartedness that although exaggerated for many people, it frighteningly envies them since from the moment Steve opens the screen, he himself decides to open up to the world and life !! It is a film considered by me personally, a true genius as well as a masterpiece!"
" Awful
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,2,"This film is one of the heaviest anda worst I've seen the last years. Histrionic, exagerated... It's impossible todo believe one scene...Avoid it"
" One of the best movies so far
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,9,"Incredible shots and awesome colors.
So simple and so good.
It's a must see"
" An emotional grinder
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,9,"Unflinching and emotional. The characters are tough to like in the first half of the film, as the son spews racist comments and does all sorts of wildly inappropriate things. We find out he has ADHD and an attachment disorder, and that his father passed away a few years ago, but his behavior is still quite a test of our ability to empathize. While his mom deals with issues of her own (not the least of which is trying to make ends meet), we see he isn't getting enough guidance and medical/psychiatric attention, and the situation seems hopelessly stacked against him. It reminded me a little of The Florida Project in its depiction of the struggle they're going through near the bottom of the economic spectrum, and far from being glamorized, presented flaws and all.I loved how Xavier Dolan played with the aspect ratio here, giving us an almost claustrophobic sense of their limited prospects in life, and then widening it gloriously when things begin to go well. The relationship with the neighbor across the street is pretty special, and the scene the two women (Anne Dorval and Suzanne Clément) share at the end is brilliant. Dorval's reaction as the other woman crosses the street, privately breaking down, is especially well acted. Antoine Olivier Pilon is fantastic too, and one thing I admired about his performance is that he never softens it, never artificially attempts to be liked by the audience, even in in his character's introspective moments. I won't spoil it, but the scenes showing the future and what follows, touching on dreams and angst, are an emotional grinder. This is a great film, one that will probably churn you up."
" POV disconnect
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,6,"Aside from exceptional performances and a decent script, I took issue with the choice of music in the film, more specifically at the moments they were used. Although I listen to these artists myself on occasion, I just felt the choices didn't quite mix too well with our protagonist (Steve). Not really sure if they were meant to be from his direct point of view, but perhaps different choices may have aided in our connection with him; some were a touch too ""mellow"" at points. But I understand the discretion of not trying to be too explicit.Also, the issue of paying for Steve's past behaviour at his former school wasn't really resolved. Perhaps his mother could have been in a small apartment in the ending scenes or we observed her saying thanks again to a person wearing a suit and toting a briefcase leaving her house as her neighbour entered. Not sure, maybe I missed something.What I took from the mothers ""flash forward"" scene near the end kind of made her seem a bit more selfish in terms of not wanting to potentially lose the connection with her son. It made me question her motivations of truly helping him for him and not just for her own insecurities.Nice Job overall."
" Everyone deals with their lives their own ways
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,8,"But I found this movie was just like life and that's maybe why I liked it so much.
Some people were disappointed with the lack of depth in the characters but people don't always show much depth and are just who they are.Some people were also annoyed with how mental health was portrayed. Mental health can be portrayed in multiple ways and I don't think that any person with a critical mind would think that every ADHD teenager would be like Steve.Some people criticised the frame. I think it's a great way to change it up and watch a movie differently. Cinema needs innovation and this was a welcomed one.As for the end, it's not necessary what I expected but at the end of the day, it's also pretty realistic to me.Some people hate how the person who said to love the most acted apparently with the least love and the fact that it teaches a 'bad lesson'.Movies don't need to be like fables and teach lessons. Again, life is life. We have to stop looking for specific lessons.A good movie is an experience full of emotions. This movie is a good one. It's not perfect. For example it is hard to patch the mum's work life but I'd rather watch this than the polished boring crap our cinemas are full of."
" If you want to waste 2 hrs of your life...
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movied I have seen so far. Complete waste of 2 hrs of my life. Cheap, message less, nonsense movie."
" Dolan is a genius!
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"A story of the contentious relationship between a mother and her son filled with delirious swells of unrestrained love and sudden plunges into madness and hate. This film is screened with 1:1 aspect ratio which is very innovative I think. Dolan also told that he shot on this aspect ratio which allowed him to be very close to characters, avoid distractions and therefore the audience would only concentrate on the expressions of the characters. Btw he widened the aspect ratio to 1.85:1 for the two hopeful moments on the movie..that was best part of the movie for me..he tried to show the main character's life in a positive way...now all three main casts did a great job..Antoine is just brillant in this film..the expressions on his face really made this movie more perfect.
A very good movie. Xavier directed the movie at the age 25 or 26, that's is really incredible."
" LOVED THE RARE 1:1 RATIO
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,7,Hard to watch but still worth it. The characters are so well developed amd acted even during the intense fights and struggle. Loved the rare 1:1 aspect ratio.
" Impressive given the filmmaker's age, okay by general standards
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,6,"""Mommy"" (the title is linked to a necklace the protagonist is wearing and even if it may sound and look sweet, it is still a direct connection to the violence linked with the moment she gets it) is a Canadian French-language (not French French, but Canadian French, no surprise as it is set in Canada, made by a Canadian filmmaker and all three leads are Canadians) movie from 2014, so this one has its 5th anniversary this year already and what stands out the most about it perhaps is that the writer and director is Montreal-born Xavier Dolan, who was only 25 when this came out and still it is his fifth full feature film already. That definitely explains why many see/saw him as a bit of a prodigy, when it comes to his profession, especially because he is pretty much always also the one who comes up with the screenplays for his movies and not rarely he also plays central characters and he does so actually not just in his own movies. So he is really really active it seems and has been for years that I hope he won't suffer from exhaustion or burnout at some point. Anyway, his movie here is one in which he does not act and it runs for almost 2.5 hours, so very long, which is not too unusual for Dolan and it is by far not even his longest work. Still a massive running time and the good news is that it did not feel that long I'd say. Which makes sense because I believe that this is the movie with the highest rating here on imdb from everything Dolan made. And if you take a look at the awards recption, it really is self-explanatory. The numbers I mean, over 50 wins and over 100 nominations in total. Massive.Now let's take a more in-depth look at the film at hand: The cast is really not too big. There are only 3 big players I would say in terms of screen time: Dorval (the title character), Clément (the neighbor) and Pilo (the son). That really is not a lot for such a running time. I mean there are supporting characters of course too like the neighbor's husband or the lawyer who is interested in the main character, but these really do not have a lot of screen time or overall impact, even if they are still more significant than those who only have one brief scene like for example the women who speaks to the central character at the very beginning. (But I do want to mention the girl that the boy sings this Italian song with at the club. She was amazing and really stole the scene and her voice was a thing of beauty too. I think I'm in love.) And still these two I mentioned had a somewhat major impact on the story like with the date that went wrong (kinda surprised Steve was with them, but I guess his mother did not know what else to do with him, where else to put him, especially as the man did not complain at all, maybe even encourage if I remember correctly) or at the end, when it is basically her husband's decision that the neighbor is going to leave town. But now let's focus a bit on the three protagonists as well as the key plot. Right at the beginning, the boy returns home with his mother and before that he was in state custody. That was a reference to the lines we get to read at the very start on the screen and these indicate that it could somewhat be a film that is critical about society, but I did not really feel like that honestly. It's much more of a character story. Anyway, when the boy gets home, things seem alright at first and the two are happy to be reunited, even if occasional outbursts (racism, violence, destruction) are inevitable. But the boy's real struggles in terms of anger become visual when he attacks his mother extremely violently and one could even say he tries to kill her. But this is when the neighbor, played by Clément, comes into play and she definitely turns out to be a soothing influence on the young man. Quite a surprise when we see her take care of his wounds. He also definitely expresses sexual interest in her right from the start, but when she puts him into his place after he grabs her boobs, he knows that he crossed a boundary and accepts it. This putting in place seems to be something he needs because even when he touches his mother's boobs on one occasion, she does not do so. She does not show him it's unacceptable. His ADHD and hyperactivity and anger problems are definitely too much for her to handle. Still things get better and better the longer the film goes and the three turn out to be a harmonic trio in which the boy seems to feel comfortable. There are moments that are shocking really like the choking scene I mentioned already and it can be said that the film moves back and forth between really shocking moments and really harmonic moments. Two examples for true harmony are the dancing scene with the three in the kitchen and also when he is pushing his shopping cart on the street and really enjoying himself while we see the two women on the boardwalk nearby. This was actually a nice contrast to early on when he was out buying groceries and stuff for himself and the mother says he stole it all and then it completely escalates.But yeah, eventually the harmony vanishes. Out of nowhere, we find out how unstable the boy is as he cuts deep into his wrist and has to be taken to the ER when the three of them are out shopping at a home improvement store. And from that moment on, things go really south again, even if initially it does not seem that way. They are out on a trip again, it seems all innocent, but then we see the mother get out of the car and return with three men in white vests who are instructed to take him to a mental institution. When he realizes, he runs of course and a wild fight ensues with lots of screaming and crying too, also from the mother of course, who now really questions her decision. Things escalate again there when the employees of said hospital are not able to calm him down and convince him to follow them. Eventually a taser does the job, which was also one of the most shocking moments of the film. At the end, we get all kinds of pseudo harmony. Steve is in a straightjacket making a call to his mother who is not present to accept it and he seems happy, but that is only because he is really seriously drugged. Then we see his mother again and we find out that since the incident at the hospital she and her neighbor did not have too much contact anymore, so their conversation has turned to fake basically as the mother pretends she is not sad about the neighbor's decision to leave town, but is happy for her that she gets to a big city. Honestly I thought in this scene that the mother was heavily drugged too with moodlifters or antidepressants, but apparently not, she was just acting. So quite a challenge for the actress to act twice you could say at the same time. And for the neighbor, pay attention to the speech impediment during this scene. Also, as for her friendship with the other woman (the title character), it appears that it cannot stand the test of time without the young man. Obviously, Mommy's words that she will visit the neighbor in her new town seem very unlikely. As for the speech impediment, it was literally gone when she was around her two new friends earlier during the film which shows how much she enjoyed their company. The moments when we hear her daughter for example call her (pay attention to how it is the other way around, normally it is mother calling daughter to stop playing and come in for dinner) or her husband she immediately struggles again with being able to get out the right words. So in the end, as sad as it may seem especially given the progress everybody was making, all are losers again and at very low states of happiness. No forced happy ending here, that much is safe.So overall, Dolan did a fine job. One thing that came to my mind here and also came to my mind when I watched other movies he made was how much he reminded me of Fassbinder. That one was also incredibly active as writer, director and actor in his pretty early years, though not as early as Dolan. And also the characters Dolan wrote reminded me sometimes of modern versions of Fassbinder's. I'd be really surprised if the young Canadian filmmaker would not list RWF as one of his idols and inspirations. Plus music is always a key factor in their works. There were some nice song selections in this film here, not just the one by Dido early on. Or that both seem workaholics. I do hope though things eventually do not go as bad for Dolan health-wise as they did for Fassbinder. He was always on the edge. There are more parallels between the two I think, such as both filmmakers often casting the same actors for their movies. Maybe you will see these similarities yourself when you check out this film and other works from Dolan. And have seen some of Fassbinder's stuff. I should not take this for granted really only because I have, for after all I am from his country and he is still considered sort of an icon these days here and many people know him, even many who weren't even born when he died back in the early 1980s. Just like myself. So back to this film here now: Like I said in the title of my review already, it deserves a thumbs-up for sure, even if I do believe that the rating is a bit too high. Truly outstanding moments I did not see too many here and I was not on the edge of my seat too frequently either. But I was kinda baffled how full the showing was. I've been to this theater frequently and I don't think this room was ever that filled, there were even people sitting on the floor. Dolan seems to have a loyal following and fanbase it seems, especially in the LBGT community here. And probably everywhere else too. So yeah, not one of the best films from 2014 and also not my favorite Dolan film, probably not even top3, but I give it a thumbs-up all in all. Go watch if you don't mind the length."

This guy tried in spite of himself to react positively and his dream was to graduate but life in his case could not change for the better ... if it could never get worse ... this is the demonstration of the fact that the pain inner and mental illness can lead to death, especially if one suffers for long years and the illness is considered chronic. When you suffer intensely you only want to let off steam and be free ... free from all that suffering ... free from all people's prejudices. There are people like Steve who will never get out of it ... yet in all this suffering there is something special about him ... something magical ... fascinating that makes him unique.

More chaos ensues.It would be very tempting to call this film a ""kitchen sink drama"". There are many explosive scenes which are cathartic. Most films would have only a few such scenes, maybe only one at the climactic finale. While the catharsis might seem too much, every one of those scenes works well because of the great talent of director Xavier Dolan and his equally talented cast.There are thankfully lighter scenes that show the love in the dysfunctional family and their ability to have fun especially as they are joined by a mysterious neighbour across the street, Kyla, who seems to have her own troubles. Her troubles seem lessened as she bonds with the unusual mother-son duo. Kyla's situation seems a bit too mysterious at times. As a subplot, it could have used a few hints to tap viewers further into the reasons why she prefers the family across the street to her own.The film's greatest strengths are two scenes near the end. One is the perfectly executed climactic scene. The other is the one that follows - a very melancholy scene of transition with which most viewers could sadly identify.As mentioned, Dolan has directed a superb cast. As the troubled teenager, Antoine Olivier Pilon has the perfect balance of rage and vulnerability. As the neighbour Kyla, Suzanne Clément is very believable as someone facing change and loosening up especially when she has fits of uncontrollable laughter. As the mother, Anne Dorval gives Dolan another superb performance as she did with ""I Killed My Mother"" (2009). Her range in the final two pivotal scenes display true brilliance. - dbamateurcriticRATING: 9/10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Performance by Anne Dorval"
" Awful
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,1,"I had to watch this amateurishly made student film in one of my classes. After being tortured with a few minutes of this nonsense, I came to some observations: Terrible overuse of Oasis, and their dreadfully overplayed song ""Wonderwall."" Watching a kid skateboard down a street while 90s Britpop blares in your ears just screams pretentious hipsterism, and is a poor attempt to galvanize audience investment. The annoying aspect ratio doesn't help either. Overall this ""film"" is just another example of overrated Western filmmaking. Shocked that this won top awards."
" Kick in the guts
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,10,"This film leaves you feeling as if you've been kicked in the guts (similar effect had the 'We need to talk about Kevin') with truly stellar performances, a mature direction with striking images that carve into your mind, and a story that even though most of us have never faced feels very personal indeed. Highly recommended!"
" Stunning!
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,9,"""Mommy"" is one the best films I've ever seen in my entire Life. Dolan plays with our emotions all along the film. The actings and cinematography are so real that you do deep into it the first minutes you watch it. It tells a lot about love and life and how to spend it, it tells a lot about being strong and fight for what you love, despite the numerous problems you can fight. It's simply a Masterpiece !"
" Absolutely Stunning Film
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,9,"It can be easily said that Xavier Dolan is one the foremost directors of our time and he proved this by making this gorgeous film.
The film contains so much dramatic elements and uses them accurately. Furthermore, there are some scenes that are so humorous.
You might see yourself while giggling those scenes.If we talk about cast and performances , we could say the actor,playing Steve, showed us one of the most perfect 
teenager performances who tries to deal with psychological problems
and the mother made us feel the reality of the low class Canadian family.Of course the other leading actress succesfully accompanied them.The way of Xavier Dolan's using musics was great. 
Although the musics were well-known by people by us, we literally effected all of them thanks to Xavier Dolan's wise.
Espically the scene that consisted of the music Exprience by Ludovico Einaudi is the best scene of the film.I just froze. The film has some shortcomings, one of them is scenario.The Script was relatively standart.
It was usual and not able to make us really suprise. But don't worry probably you won't care while watching because of its awesome atmosphere.
Another shortcoming is that The film ,towards in the midlle of it,was dull. It was not only dull but also boring.
Nonetheless, it was be able to overcome after some boring scenes.
You were being able to find yourself watching the film without even taking breath.
 
What is great about this film is that we could see marvelous performances and of course the expertism of the Xavier Dolan's directing.Score : 9/10"
" I wanted to like this.
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,5,"It's interesting. The characters are, well they're very annoying, which makes it hard to like or even enjoy. It's fast paced, tiring and kinda claustrophobic. This last bit partly due to the square frame. Yeah, square! Like Instagram. It's seriously intense. A mother trying to deal with her mentally unstable teenage son, trapped by their spiralling lives. That is until the half way point, soundtracked by Wonderwall, the screen is literally pulled wide open with enthusiastic happiness. Our troubled boy screams ""I'm free"" and it's quite spectacular. It's short lived though and as the screen pulls back to its square format, it feels even more constricted. It's painful, awkward sometimes to watch, tense, crushing. Thankfully more highs do follow, but the whole film is up and down, with happiness seemingly only a dream. It does have a rather rousing finale and it has to be said that the acting throughout is stellar. I can't quite shake the feeling of disappointment though."
" This film is a FILM
",2018-04-11 00:00:00,9,"Mommy is pure cinema.It is a film that speaks a cinematic language and creates genuine feelings to the viewer.
 
 Xavier Dolan, both by his extremely powerful and impressive direction and by his ability to write such a realistic,simple but effective story achieves something that few movies have done:he makes s a part of the film and immerses us in an unforgettable experience.
 
The film,for its most part, is shot in a 1:1 screen ratio.In this way, it instantly provokes a strong sense of claustrophobia and seems like it has the role of a small camera that moves around the characters' problems and desires.This technique makes the film more realistic and sad.
 
The movie has a beautiful soundtrack, from ""Born to Die"" to ""Wonderwall"".The songs add so much emotion to the scenes and the lyrics really fit to the movie's theme.Mommy is, surprisingly, one of the most well-acted movies of all time.The there actors are masters of their craft give powerful performances.During the movie couldn't distinguish the actor from the character.Moreover, their characters are perfectly developed and totally realistic.The film talks about our desires for a happy life and shows that an ideal life may never be achieved.We have to struggle and try unconditionally.Although it is a depressing film, it manages to deal with themes like love and care in a wonderful way.It is a haunting and magical film.The movie had an incredible impact on me and I can't wait to see it again, despite the fact that I will burst into tears after seeing it."
" A love story between a mother and a son whit ADHD
",2018-04-10 00:00:00,10,"Xavier Dolan is hardly 30 years old, but has already made eight movies. For me is mommy the first film of him that i have seen. It is settled in Quebec in the near future, and in accordance with a new Canadian law (S 14), that allowds parents of children with neuropsychiatric disabilities to place their uncontrollable child in health care institutions. For Diane Désprés (Anne Dorval), mother of 15-year-old Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon), it this completely ruled out as a option. When Steve is thrown out of his last youth home, after firing in he cafeteria school and causing severe burns to another student, Diane takes him home to her house It obviously leads to a lot of problems even if they love each other, which I recognize, as I also have an ADHD-diganos. It makes it extra hard to see Steve suffer in the tumult that occurs between them, no matter who is ""guilty"" for the moment. All the scens in the movie quickly switches between the characters' both negative and positive emotions. As for the style of the has Xavier made it in 1.1 format, which gives the feeling of that is as recorded whit a verry expensive mobile camera. It gets you grasped by the people's facial expressions. However, In the scene, where Steve goes on a longboard and cries out freedom!, the format enlarges and captures the environment. You really getting touched by Steve's longing for freedom when he does not live up to the demands of the environment. His feelings are enhanced by film music, which are well-known hits like Oasis Wonderwall and Lana del Reys Born to die."
" Neurodivergents are scary and abusive!
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,1,"Just what we needed: yet another movie that portrays people with mental illnesses/differences as predatory and abusive. Especially when it's coated with apologism because he's a white boy, even though it didn't particularly get into what passes for mental health care in the US. Then again I got too fed up with using mental conditions as a bogeyman that I turned it off. But hey, it passed the lowest bar ever: The Bechtel Test."
" Extremely bad feature-film
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,1,"The director of this film seems does not know anything or does not want to know (even worser when so) about dramatisation. The story is very boring and uninteresting, for sure for the general public. Acting is awful,mostly ""over the top""=overacting, you feel and see that the actors/actresses are acting (very bad when you got that feeling!) This film is one of the most bad films I have ever seen in my life(I am now 71) after seeing about 4400 films and of them most of all the films made by the famous filmdirectors in the world history of filmmaking, as is : Bergmann,Fellini,Kubrick Another good second very bad film is Paper soldier ( made by the son of the Russian filmdirector Herman) That this film has won so much prizes and admirers is nearly only by making a hype about a film which seems to be quite normal nowadays. It seems also because the voters in Cannes etc. cannot find another film to promote of its real values!"
" The incredible attention to detail
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,9,One thing that struck me was the incredible attention to detail that Dolan possesses. As we learn about Dies financial problems and struggles with making ends meet one scene in particular backs up this statement. The nail polish bottles in the refrigerator. A thing that people who buy cheap nail polish is familiar with and such a beautiful use of mise-en-scene. The film works solely because of Dolans unique attention to detail and is a delight to watch because of it.
" Mother's Immortal Love
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,10,"Mommy is a drama about a problematic teenager Steve, diagnosed with ADHD, kicked out of school, and his not much less problematic single mother Diane. The two are not an ideal combination in making the best life decisions but they most certainly remind you what true bondage between a mother and a son represents.The whole story is quite overwhelming, with a lot of ups and even more downs. The basic point is to show how every mother loves her child eternally and to indicate that the love can't be broken whatsoever. Every child knows it but rare are the ones who are truly grateful and who cherish it each day... Which they should, because a mother is a person who loves you most from your first to the last day of life, even though it may not always seem that way. So, this movie makes you wonder if you are enough thankful for having a caring and loving mother.I liked that this drama shows in fact an extreme situation in family and it is more than interesting watching oscillations in relationship between Steve and Diane. It was honestly an emotional roller coaster for me too and, as I said, inspired me to revalue my priorities and encouraged me to value immaterial things in life. I highly recommend watching this movie. It is a rare, but a well deserved 10/10 from me."
