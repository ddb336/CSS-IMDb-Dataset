" Exaggeration
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,1,"At one point it was a grade of 8, but this is an exaggeration!"
" Comparable with the craftsmanship of the Notebook
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,9,"I'm not really a fan of romantic movies and therefore only the best is good enough.Despite the title of this review I also do not like to compare movies.Sure maybe some critics find that the younger version of the characters have not a lot in common with the ""present"" in the movie but that is what live, bad choices and trauma's do to you.An unexpected ending completes this beautiful movie which you have to see before judging.It is even more rare for me to see a movie twice but only the best once only get a review after I get to see it again after a couple years. This one touched me as much as years ago.It really moved me, which is rare and that is why I do get l (touch to) low score on IMDB."
" went in hopeful, left uneasy
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,3,"This movie was quite jarring. i went in watching it for james marsden, and left rather disturbed/uneasy. beware."
" The plot of a horrible movie
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,4,"Can't find a really convincing reason why some people like this movie ??
The movie was one of the worst romantic films ever, the plot of the film was repeated in a very banal way, the ending was stupid and far from logic, and add to that (depressing) !! Why?!
A child is about to die in a car accident. His heart is injured (about to loss its beats) ... and Boom! he's now in dire need of an urgent heart transplant. And by the strange coincidence (his mother's former lover gets shot and dies in a completely distant state) and by chance again .. Hospitals all around The US ignore all patients on the waiting list who need a heart transplant .. And the heart of the former lover goes to her son !! Are you really serious?!!"
" The Best of Nicolas Sparks Don't Miss
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,10,"Having just seen ""The Choice"", another Nicolas Sparks movie which I find enjoyable - moved by great dialog and titulating chemistry between the lead characters, but the plot was simple - ""The Best of Me"" is much more intricately woven, infused with great trauma and tragedy . Now I understand why Sparks fans rave about this novel over his other works. Mr Sparks is a model of
efficiency - every character has a precise role in this screen play. While the interleaving of young Dawson and Amanda's love story with present day reunion takes some getting used to but you'd find the story ultimately satisfying. The story begins interestingly of two former lovers called to a
reading of the will at an athorney's office after an old friend passed away. Tuck,the old friend was a father figure to young Dawson who took Dawson in when he ran away from an abusive father. And he also defended him when the Dawson clan came for him. The wise & benevolent Tuck bequeathed his estate to both of them. Because of a deep hurt and abandonment due to tragic
circumstance, Amanda is cool at first upon seeing Dawson yet they have to spend time together to clear the belongings. Old memory is rekindled. Soon, everything that drawn them together as young lovers slowly returned, until they become fully engaged in each other again. The morning after spending a passionate night, Amanda takes a call from her teenage son. It is the usual mom thing. ""I'd see you soon, love ya"" says Amanda in closing the call. Dawson senses their moral quandry that Amanda has a life, a family to return to, tells her ""We really can't do this, can we?"". The story kicks into another gear when Amanda returns to her husband. I will not spoil the meticulous plot. Sparks' book is structured with multi-layers around the central characters. While it is not high literature, but it still strikes the right cords, asking some profound questions, especially the letters from Tuck to Dawson and Amanda, and the letter from Dawson to Amanda after she returned home. If you are like me, you'll find this movie highly gratifying and come away loving that special someone even more than before."
" BEAUTIFUL FILM
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,10,"TOUCHED EVERY ROMANTIC NERVE IN MY BODY. MOVED ME SPIRITUALLY.
USED UP A LOT OF TISSUES.
LEFT ME SMILING.
ACTING, DIRECTION, AND SETTING ALL TOP RANGE. THANK YOU."
" Unremarkable
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,3,"Have watched this before but the movie was so unremarkable that I accidentally watched it again. I just had to say that they have very poor casting. The younger versions didn't looked even the slightest bit of what they portrayed when they grew older. Young Dawson even looked older and more mature than his older character.
The story plot is predictable. Typical conflicted love story."
" Amazing love story...
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Lovers reunite after 20 years in a village home..really its a feel good movie...
Worth watchable..."
" Hmm
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,7,"The young characters, Dawson and Amanda, have a lot of chemistry and great potential. Loved that story. But the adults have no chemistry at all, and the ending sucked."
" Beautiful movie
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,10,"Wow, so beautiful, no words left. But so sad for Dawson omg. Why did it end so hard. Pff. When Dawson came as an angel in Amanda's room. I knew he already past away. I really didn't expect the family Cole to be so agressive in a nice romantic movie like this. A bit shocking. I loved the movie. Loved it. Sila (the Netherlands). A 10 score for me"
" If you enjoy Nicholas Sparks' movies, then you'll love this.
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,8,"Take no notice of the negative reviews. If you've liked Nicholas Sparks' movies in the past, and you've read the synopsis for 'The Best of Me' and you think it sounds like a good movie, then I think you'll enjoy this film. True, the ending is sad and a little tough to accept, but it's still a beautiful love story."
" Do not watch if you want a feel good film!
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,7,The film itself is good but nowhere was is advertised that its got a sad ending! If you're like me and you wanted a romance film that makes you feel good at the end then don't bother.Basically you're waiting for them to get together and they finally realise they're in love with each other and the guy gets shot and killed.I can't fault the film itself just I never see the point in builiding a love story up and getting watchers invested just to have one of the main characters die.
" the best of me
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,8,"Omg this movie. so sad man, first bobby and then dawson himself. and i loved how it went back and forth from now time to the past. love dawson and amanda both. i can't believe dawson died and gave his heart to her son my eyes."
" Messy.
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,6,"1. Sparks writes very good books, but he should change a lil bit. The Notebook has the plot. The meet as teenagers, the they lose each others for years, and then they meet again. Come on Sparks!
2. Veeery messy, didn't ""draged"" me into the story as The Notebook did.
3. Lot of mistakes. When they make out as adults the scar on his shoulder is gone. Really?
When they are on the porch and he is telling her that they cannot be together, you can clearly see that when the camera is behind him and he is talking, the jaw doesn't move, or it moves out of sinc. Very bad ADR.The plot is nice, even tho...pretty much same as T.N., but the movie it is done pretty bad in my opinion. When you have a good story, it is a shame to not make a wonderful movie out of it."
" Really Bad
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,3,"Take my words with a grain of salt as romance films are not my cup of tea. But this is such a cheesy piece of crap. Everything about it is so laughable to me that it's ridiculous. They have different actors playing younger and older versions of the same characters, but they look nothing alike and are very close in age to begin with. Totally unnecessary, confusing, and very very stupid. But it is I also very fun. Not funny enough to waste you're time with this however. Be sure to skip it."
" Absolutely loved this movie!
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,10,"Brilliant acting, brilliant storyline, not as predictable or 'sugary' as many romance movies. This was very believable, kept me enthralled from start to finish - and my attention is not easily sustained by most movies. I cried a couple of times, some gut wrenching moments.It reminded me a little of The Notebook - which was another movie I really loved. This one is a little more gritty though, which wasn't always easy viewing - but very necessary for the story - which is told so well.Highly recommend this!"
" Bad adaptation.
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,4,"As an individual work, it is an ok movie, but for those who read the book like me, expected a minimally consistent adaptation, but not what we see here, there is no chemistry between the main couple, apart from changes in crucial parts of the story."
" Chemistry and casting
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,8,"Nice movie, but the younger couple had way more chemistry than the older. And the casting was horrible they look nothing alike the older versions of themselves"
" I hate it
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,2,"For gods sake if u hate bad endings don't watch it,I really hoped that they would end up together after all that time and..? NOTHING HE GETS KILLED BY HIS FATHER.God dammit i hate it!!!
And im crying because ughhh..."
" The Best of Sparks
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,10,"Plot twist after plot twist. By far my favorite film by Sparks. I'm usually very good at predicting movies, but this one kept me on my toes. Grab tissues it's a tear jerker! Very underrated movie! 10/10!!"
" They kept adding cheese upon cheese.
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,2,"This review is probably one big spoiler, so you may not want to read any further, (although I'll recommend it if you don't wanna waste your time, and I should know cause i surely wasted mine), but here goes the plot. High school kids Amanda (WASP girl) and Dawson (white trailer trash) meet and falls madly in love. Then he goes to prison, and being all noble and sir Galahad, he refuses to see her anymore and tells her to forget him and get on with her life. So after sometime she marries an asshole husband and have 2 kids, one of them dying of cancer after 2 years.
Then after 20 years they meet again and find out that they are still madly in love. The plot works in 2 timelines, and you may wonder why the younger versions of the two don't bear any resemblance to the older ones. Anyway the guy dies and she's heartbroken, but it makes her get out of her marriage and supposedly live a happy and fulfilling life thereafter. So this is obviously a TITANIC sort of plot. No happy ending, no sir :) The problem is that everything is so predictable. Like the pregnant girl begging her boyfriend not to join the hero in a family showdown. (Right, this dude won't be coming back). Or when her son is fatally injured and needs a new heart, (oh, a new heart just came in, how convenient). Then the hero gets shot and killed by his dad, (gee, i wonder where his heart went). Years later the son finds out that the heart was from our guy,(BIG surprise !!) and when he tells his mom she smiles sadly, knowing that her true love will now always be a part of her through her son. I think this is where we're supposed to start ravaging the kleenex tissues, but at this point I had swallowed about as much cheese as i could possibly manage.My 2 stars goes to Gerald McRainey, who may not save this movie, but at least delivers a professional performance."
" The ultimate love story
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,10,This film is the ultimate love story. It's cute and whingey. I loved this film. Highly recommended for when you want a cry.
" Boring and predictable - Just re-watch The Notebook!
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,1,"Sad and slow script that feels like a re-used harlequin paperback. Stereotypical and predictable. Btw, trying to be noble is NOT a good way to live.
Badly cast teen-versions that are not even the same hight as there older selves. On top of everything super-sweet and fluffy it all turns bitter and trite. Just to much stuff going on. And ""Super Shocker"" ending that you see coming from a mile away. Looking 4 a great lovestory? Don't waste your time on this pre The Choice. Just re-watch The Notebook!"
" You must watch this movie
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,10,"I'm new to the imdb platform, I watch a lot of movies this year, so I can say that I started using the imdb platform a lot. Anyway, if I have to talk about the movie, if you like romantic movies, you're gonna love this movie. The last scene will take you away."
" A cliche wrapped in schmaltz wrapped in corniness
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,4,"It will only take on sentence to point out the good in this movie. The young actors Liana Liberato and Luke Bracy are actually good in this movie and have good chemistry and trying to work with the garbage they have been given.The rest of this movie is painfully awful. Michelle Monaghan and James Marsden other than their young counterparts have no chemistry at all. Marsden I have never really seen delivering a good performance. He is not really bad but nothing sticks out and like in this movie is usually hired to look good. I give both the benefit of the doubt because nobody could make this work.
By ""this"" I mean dialog that gives the words cringe worthy a whole new meaning. Which brings me to the childish attempt of direction here. This movie lacks any subtlety. Everything is spit in the face obvious. Every scene with heaven in the background has this very bad computer colored clouds in yellow and pink. If you would count cliches here your head would explode. Examples: Disapproving parents, check, corny rain scene, check, girl sitting on a white swing, check and the list goes on. To sum it up this is an awful movie, badly directed, badly written with bad dialog, a contrived story and actors trying to hold this piece of crap together."
" Wow.
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,7,"This actually made me sad. It was corny and cliché like 80% of the time yes, but it was actually kind of great, and I liked it. Rare"
" Ridiculous
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,1,"Enough Nicholas Sparks movies!!!!! Who decided it was a good idea to adapt this book to the big screen? Why are these kinds of stories even getting published in the first place?!I'll admit, I am somewhat of a romantic, but stories like this are just so unrealistic, predictable, and downright ridiculous. So within the span of like 4 days, Dawson gets into a fatal accident that he somehow survives, Tuck dies, Dawson and Amanda make up, Amanda's son needs and GETS a heart transplant, AND Dawson dies???????? And then, to top it all off, it turns out DAWSON was the one who donated the heart!!!!!!I'm done with movies about grown women having mid life crises and deciding to be unfaithful in pursuit of some childish pleasure. And the make up scene between them was so much like the Notebook, it was boring. If I were Sparks' wife, I would NOT trust him around other women.. he is obsessed with the idea of infidelity. And then that ridiculous Seven Pounds ending??? And what's with good, rich girls always falling for the boys from bad families that they can never end up with without disappointing their parents? Such an overused movie trope.I really hope there aren't people out there who watch these kinds of movies and then set some unrealistic expectations for their own love lives.In conclusion, do something better with your time."
" SPARKS MAGIC
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,10,"I just experienced one of the most romantic stories I have seen in years. For those who like the tears to flow this is the magic one from Nicholas Sparks. James Marsden is a dreamy as ever, every time you look into his eyes, he just takes you away. The story unfolds at a lovely pace, and brings everything together as it unfolds. I thought The Notebook was very moving but this one takes you on an incredible journey."
" Definitely recommend
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,8,I would recommend this movie especially if you are in a crying mood warning just prepare to have lots of tissues
" Cliche would be a compliment
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,5,"I don't know where to begin with this movie, but I guess the writers also don't know what they did here. First it starts as a typical boy meets girl flashback story. That part lasted really long, was interesting in some moments, but in summary it was just mediocre. If that part was a movie by itself, I would fall asleep. The characters don't have any interesting dialogues, we don't see the connection between these two happening. They just fall in love and we are supposed to believe it- well, ok. But then the story takes some really unnecessary plot twists, that ruined the mediocre formulaic story and made it into a mess. It seemed like they mixed 3 different movies into one, just to make it interesting. What I hoped this would be is something like ""Blue Jay"", where the movie focuses only on two people with great chemistry interacting with each other. But what we got is a cheesy action cartoon disguised as romance. If it was written after a book, then making a movie out of it might not have been the brightest idea, because it's just bad."
" Read the book or not, just don't watch the movie!
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,2,If you're going to make a movie based on a book it needs to somewhat resemble it!
" Unbelievable! Disturbing!
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,1,"I cannot believe it! This is like a very bad joke. This could have been one of the most romantic and beautiful films ever and then whoever wrote it decided to make it the worst one in history. Such lovely, strong and wonderful characters and too much tragedy! I think not even life is as harsh as this piece!
So much bad taste, so unnecessary... Everything, Bobb's death is so rough and hard to take, but that end! Gosh! Really? Totally upsetting! I read there's a book, I guess it's the same ending, I blame whoever had thought of thit story on the first place!
I skip spoilers and try to avoid them everytime I can but I deeply think there'll have to be some kind of warning about thinkgs like this, seriously. I was supossed to have a nice time before going to bed and it was a heartbreaking and hated one!"
" Who Cast This?
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,3,"Usually when you have a split story of when someone was young and old they try to make the characters look at least remotely similar. This was not even close. It was enjoyable sentimental cheese, but in Nicolas Sparks tradition, convoluted and predictable, which in of itself is quite a feat. The acting is excellent, but I think it comes down to the old saying, I could watch that actor read the phonebook... this movie is essentially a phonebook."
" Very underrated and good spoilers at the end.
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,7,"The Best Of Me is a 2014 Romantic Drama starring Michelle Monaghan and James Marsden and tells the tale of former childhood sweethearts Dawson Cole and Amanda who break up and are reunited 20 years later as a former friend of theirs died.Will the two concile,despite the fact Amanda is now a married woman with a teenage son?.
Overall this has got to be one of the darkest of Nicholas Sparks franchise as one of the charcthers gets murdered in the end of the film(Spoiler Alert) Dawson Cole dies as he gets caught by bad guys who shoved their truck near the trainwrecks and one of the hitmen shoots Dawson in the chest and he dies yet his heart works on Amanda's son in the end of the movie.If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks franchise than you will probably like this film."
" Why would you ruin a perfect movie?
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,6,"It had everything to be a masterpiece. I knew it was based on a Nicholas Spark novel, so I kind of expected the debacle in the end, but that did not help anyway. I still hated the ending. Man, if they are not to be together, let the man live for crying out loud."
" Suprisingly good
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,9,"If you like slightly cheesy romantic films (like the notebook) then this film is definitely for you,characters were great,slightly predictable but really enjoyable movie"
" Wow, one of the best movies ever!
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,10,I do not get any of the bad reviews. This in my mind is one of the best love stories ever! Don't listen to any bad reviews watch it and make your own decisions. I've watched it over 10 times and will watch it many times more!! Amazing actors. Love it!!
" one of the best Nicholas Sparks adaptations
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it shows that after the reckless teenagers in love drift apart they re-fall in love many years later. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Ok soooo
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,1,I do not recommend this movie! Main character dies😅👍🏼 Cliché
" Life is too short to watch this
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,1,"I predicted every move, every turn every ""next moment"", it was THAT predictable. But, I predicted the ending as a joke.........and it was !"
" Brilliant
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,10,"Really good movie, Worth the watch 100%!! Any Nicholas sparks movie is a must!!"
" Such a great movie
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,8,It was filled with so much love and happiness but at the same time it was heartbreaking. Which made it even better.
" Love or free fall
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,9,"Well if you are watching it with your girlfriend or boyfriend, that heart breaking end will bring you more close and if you are watching it alone, may be it will break you more."
" Brilliant chick flick
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,10,"A brilliant romance/chick flick. Loved the characters, loved the actors, loved the plot!Found this while I was browsing for a new chick flick and I will definitely watch again. Loved it!"
" I love it so much
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,10,It's amazing and a great movie based off of an even greater book!!
" It's a 90-Minute Super Bowl Ad for Budweiser
",2018-04-12 00:00:00,4,"Nicholas Sparks hit paydirt when The Notebook came out. Everything coalesced perfectly with the story and actors who portrayed the characters in the movie. The Notebook elevated Sparks to another level as a writer.Since then, Sparks has tried to recapture the magic of The Notebook by remixing the story and trying to retell it over and over with different twists at the end. That's one reason I've lost respect for Nicholas Sparks as a writer. He's basically rehashing the same ideas in different order.The Best of Me is basically a 90-minute Super Bowl ad for Budweiser. The product placement is so intentionally that it's actually distracting. There must have been 10 different scenes with Bud placed 'just so' in order for the viewing audience to see the label.James Marsden (Dawson) was great in The Notebook, and he's great in this movie. He and Michelle Monaghan are really the only thing that makes this movie bearable. Their character development was solid, but the rest of the characters including Tuck, their elderly BFF who for some reason was friends with both characters, and Monaghan's on-screen husband was weak.As a side note, the younger actor who played Dawson and James Marsden look NOTHING like each other. It was pretty distracting to follow the story with two guys playing the same character who didn't even 'kind of' look the same.We never really know why Dawson's dad is such a jerk. They look nothing like each other, and Dawson's dad looks to be about the same age. They hate each other through forced tension that eventually leads to an unbelievable climax at the end where Dawson gets shot by his dad from about 100 yards away for no good reason. I don't know why any dad would do what is portrayed in this movie.I supposed the need to have something dramatic was the impetus for the scene where Dawson had to die some terrible death, but it just wasn't believable. Perhaps Sparks couldn't gone and pulled some other scene from The Notebook and rehashed that instead.Finally, the lighting and cinematography of this film was off. It was too bright and fuzzy in a number of the scenes that made it look more like a dream sequence than what was supposed to be happening.From here on out, just watch The Notebook instead of Sparks rehashing and remixing The Notebook into something less than spectacular."
" Decent enough Nicholas Sparks romance.
",2018-04-09 00:00:00,5,"You know what to expect before going into this: a star-crossed romance for lovers from different worlds, kisses in the rain, flashbacks, moonlight swims, fateful separations and the tragic death of at least one leading character.The scenery along the way is beautiful though and I enjoyed both the leads James Marsden & Michelle Monaghan but the story is pretty bland and I would say this in one of the weaker Nicholas sparks adaptions.It follows Amanda and Dawson, soul mates who met as teens, joining them decades later after they are torn apart by circumstances beyond their control. They of course have never forgotten each other and get a second chance when the passing of an old friend sees them ""willed"" back to his house to fulfill his final wishes. As they get reacquainted we flashback to them as teens, which was strangely done . It was meant to be 1993 but for some reason the director had it in his head to make it appear like the 1950's, with flouncy poodle skirts, drive ins and just a general feel. Honestly I won't remember this in about weeks time."
" Was This Really A Nicholas Sparks Story?
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,2,"Was this really a Nicholas Sparks story? If so, I can only blame the people involved in making it into a film for doing such a bad job. What are they called - the ""adaptation"" people?Anyway, at least 30 minutes before the end I knew what was going toi happen. It was that obvious. I kept asking ""When are the bad guys going toi show up and ruin all this happy stuff?"" And then we find her bot needs a new heart. Well, it's obivous whose heart it's gonig to be!And sure as sh**, up come the bad baoys shoving his truck into the train. Yeah, so he's going to die in a train wrech and his heart will go to the boy! Easy peasy.Oh, but wait. There's a twist in thtail. He doesn't get shoved into the train. Whoo-dee-doo. So it's gongi to be a happy anding after all! Oh, what a relief!But wait! No! Another of the bad guys shoots him and he dies anyway. OK, veru vclever, we all thought it was going to be OK , but it wasn't. Aren't you dcript writers so damn clever.PS. sinvce when do heart donors become availbe within hours of someone neeing a new heart? THAT didn't pass the smalell tesat.
PPS. So when she gets the phone sAll that Dawson is dead, how come she didn't realise it was HIS heart that ws available. I guess because the scritpwriters can add yet another where the boy tells his mum who the donor was.Oh dear, such a contrived storyline.Next time, Mr Sparks, pleaase make sure you get approval rights for the sdcreen adaptation. Hopefully you'll prevent you next story being converted into an abomination like this was."
" So many tears!
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,10,"I have to say i LOVE movies by Nicholas Sparks and this movie was no exception. This film made me tear up a fair few times, it was a beautiful storyline with so much feeling. The connection between Dawson and Amanda is amazing. the end of the story was very touching. i slightly saw it coming about 10 minutes before hand but was very beautiful. Although if you tend to cry at a movie get a box of tissues ready because you will definitely need them.9/10 would recommend!"
" Really great!
",2017-11-07 00:00:00,8,"Nice movie, although the end should not be like this. Simply such a beautiful film should end in the best possible way. Is not it a clear need for beautiful love stories to end constantly with a catastrophe, death? Why all this? My recommendation to everyone to watch a movie, it's really worth spending 2 hours. Regardless of the end, this is a great screening of the book by Nikolas Sparks. Although such a strong love deserves its triumph and although we did not have the opportunity to see it, I must give the film a high score. Without a doubt, this was worth every second.8/10"
" Way too predictable
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,5,"This movie is so f*cking predictable. Just imagine the worst that could happen in key moments of the movie and you know exactly what's going to happen next. Although that's something most of the romantic movies have, this time it's just too much. Especially for a movie with this rating."
" A great movie which deserved a better ending
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,8,"When a man and a woman meet as a result of a very close one's testament, their life flashes back before them, bringing memories of what amazing love story they had and how it could all have ended so abruptly. The emphasis is put on the past events, combining them with pieces of the present, elucidating till the end how it happened and what went so wrong.It's a dramatic plot, with many sad and hard situations being put on the main characters, putting their immense love into jeopardy. The present events reunite the two past lovers, awaking feeling which were thought lost forever, from twenty years ago when it all happened. It's an interesting course of events which keep you eager to find out what was the cause of the breakup and how it can end up. Unfortunately, the producers decided to create it as dramatic as possible, making a certain part of the past have a huge impact also on the present, thus bringing an unnecessary sad finale. After all they have been through in the past, it shouldn't have ended in such a manner which sort of proves the opposite of what the movie was trying to say.It's one of those movies which deserve a much better ending, one that can bring a light of hope and happiness to a much troubled couple which only wanted to be together till the end of time."
" Oh so bittersweet! 8 Stars for me!
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,8,"I just watched this for the second time. I remembered the title, but not the story line. So it was a refresher. Get ready for the tissue box, but it's a really good movie that no one should miss if you love romantic dramas. I really liked how they kept going back and forth in time to tell us the story of how they met. They did a great job with the editing and timing of the story for the most part. There is a slightly confusing part near the end where the timings don't jive, but me and my family knew what they meant. Another viewer said this movie was better than the novel it was based upon called 'The Grand Design' by Nicholas Sparks, but I have not read it so I can't give you my opinion. And I just realized that the writer of this novel also wrote several other novels that were made into movies that I love, especially 'The Notebook' being my one of my favorites. So, if you are contemplating on whether to watch this or not, a resounding yes would be the answer! It's very worth it."
" Ending Changed
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,5,"I saw this wonderful movie in 2014 when it came out in the theaters & I thought it was a beautiful depiction of young love, loss & second chances. You figure out early that something tragic will happen since Dawson really believes he survived the drowning for a reason, especially after they get back together. Then Amanda's son needs a new heart & you just knew what was going to happen. I left that theater in tears, I hated that Dawson had to die so Amanda's son could live. However, I just watched this movie again today on TV & it has a totally different ending. He does not die and they walk off into the sunset together. That should not have happened & I think selling out to criticism by changing the ending is bad form. I was going to buy this movie but not now. I would have given it a 10 had I not seen it today."
" Paint-By-Numbers Romantic Drama
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,3,"As a 29-year old male, ""The Best Of Me"" was not a movie I would typically watch. But, it just happened to be ""let someone else pick the movie for a change"" night and so I gave it a try. While it isn't an outright horrible flick, it was exactly what I expected...and that's not why I watched movies.For a basic plot summary, ""Best of Me"" tells the story of Amanda (Michelle Monaghan) & Dawson (James Marsden), two 30-something adults brought back to their mutual hometown by the death of a friend. As they get re-acquainted, their romantic backstory is shown via flashbacks, with Young Amanda (Liano Liberato) and Young Dawson (Luke Bracey) navigating the trials of young love. Back in the present, the two must reconcile the lives that were with the lives that are.The trouble with this movie is that it is exactly as predictable and sappy as one would think...nothing more, nothing less. If you are a sucker for these types of movies and like to know what to expect when going in, than you will probably love this type of film-making. However, if you want a few genuine surprises and relationships that don't feel like they are being heavy manipulated to stimulate tears and tug on the heartstrings, than you should probably stay away.An interesting thought when it comes to Nicholas Sparks book-to-film translations: I don't have any ""hard numbers"" to back me up on this, of course, but I think it is a pretty safe bet that ""The Notebook"" has best the most well-received. I know young and old (and many in between) who have thoroughly enjoyed that flick. The reason? It was first. Everything after that has kind of been a different variation on the same theme: sappy romance with large doses of tragedy. I wonder if perhaps the novelty is wearing a bit thin with films like this one.That being said, it seems like there are easily enough people who like this formula and will continue to populate theaters for it. If you are able to take everything strictly at face value and not think too much, I can see how it would be very possible to get swept away in the dramatic experience. Nothing wrong with that...but not my cup of tea by a mile."
