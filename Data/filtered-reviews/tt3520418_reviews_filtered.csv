" A great comedy
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,3,This was one of those horror movies that was so laughably bad that it became good again in the form of a comedy
" Lovecraftian Haunted House Film with a Solid Cast and Effects
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,8,"This was a movie that I actually never heard of until I got into listening to podcasts. It came out during a time where I wasn't necessarily watching new horror movies for the most part. It has appeared a few times on podcasts that I listen to, so I added it to a list of movies to check out at some point. I decided to give it a go when Jake and I were looking for a movie for our podcast, Side Quest, and it paired fairly well with a movie we watched prior. The synopsis is in the cold, wintery fields of New England, a lonely old house wakes up every thirty years - and demands a sacrifice.We start this off getting the images of fields that are covered in snow. This is reminiscent for me as it looks just like I grew up in the Midwest. As the synopsis states though, we're in the New England area and not too far from Boston. We shift over to a car where we have Paul Sacchetti (Andrew Sensenig) and his wife of Anne (Barbara Crampton). The acting here sets the tone for the rest of the movie for me. I picked up immediately that there is something wrong between them. Anne seems distant and Paul is doing what he can to connect back with her.They've recently lost their son Bobby in a car accident. To try to get over it, they decided to move out of the city and bought this house in the rural community. Right after they move in, Anne starts to feel that there is a presence there. She believes it to be her son, while Paul isn't buying into it. He's more of a practical guy.Both of our characters here noticed there is something off about the basement. Anne goes down there when she hears noises. The signs she is seeing she thinks are pointing to her son. We see that there is something down there. The basement smells of smoke and is quite hot. This causes Paul to reach out to an electrician, Joe (Marvin Patterson), to see if there is something wrong with their old boiler. We get to see the attack on Paul, where the occupants of the house believe the more logical reasoning.Things get a bit weird when Paul and Anne meet their first neighbor. They've been living there for 2 weeks and it is an elderly couple of Dave McCabe (Monte Markham) and his wife Cat (Connie Neer). They share the past of the house, which was built in 1859. Originally it was a mortuary and the house has been vacant for some time. Dave shares that the couple who lived there at the time, the Dagmars, were accused of doing some shady businesses and ran out of town. As this couple goes to leave, Dave states that it is good to have a family in the house where Cat slips a note stating 'the house needs a family, GET OUT!' The couple ignores this, but are quite creeped out.Anne then convinces her husband to allow the couple of May Lewis (Lisa Marie) and her husband Jacob (Larry Fessenden) to come visit. They are in tune with the other side and she wants to see if she can communicate with their son. Paul is reluctant, but allows it. He believes if it will help her, then it could do good. The house as we see does have a presence in it, but it is much darker than we realize. As the family tries to communicate with what is there, it becomes a fight for survival.That's where I want to leave my recap for this movie. Now I've already gave a bit of background that I had the briefest idea of what this movie was about. I knew this was a take on the ghost story film and I tend to enjoy those movies. Plus, I knew of the cast and I've seen the name of the writer/director Ted Geoghegan.What really works for this movie though is the acting and the emotion comes from it. As I said in my recap, I could tell that there was something wrong and that this couple is distanced currently. I wasn't sure if there were martial issues or not, but we get introduce pretty early with the cold open that they had a son and I picked up he passed away. Crampton does so well at portraying this broken character who is trying to hold on to the past. On the other hand, I think that Sensenig does a great job at playing off of her as well. He is trying to be a rock for her and trying to get her to see sense without going over the top on it. They really do feel like a married couple for sure.Things become interesting when Paul relents to allow the parents of their son's friend come out. It is interesting to hear Harry (Michael Patrick Nicholson) state that he and Bobby were roommates' freshmen year. Regardless if they weren't as close as Anne thought, she is friends with May. Paul questions her reaching out for them to stay and I thought it was an interesting way to introduce that she is in tune with the other side. Paul doesn't necessarily believe it. He thinks that she and Jacob are just hippies, but he's a good husband and if Anne thinks it will help her, he's willing to try. Marie and Fessenden are great as well so that helps.This movie though doesn't really waste any time and I can get behind that. I thought it was a bit of a plot convenience to have Dave and Cat show up like they do early in the movie, but as the movie progresses, I can see why. They are needed to plant some seeds of doubt. It is mostly for us in my opinion though. I'm more forgiving for information that we get later in the film though. There is a meeting that happens as the climax starts that feels like another one of these, but it goes deeper with information and pushes it into a Lovecraftian type of vibe. I know not everyone will like hearing this, but I dug it.Before moving away from the story, I was feeling it was missing a bit at the end, but the start of the credits is giving us old newspapers. We learn in the movie that something seems to happen here every 30 years or so, but I love seeing the headlines to fill in the things that happened. Seeing that legitimately bumped the score up a full point for me. I'm a sucker for research and that satisfied an urge for me. I do question why this wasn't in the beginning of the movie though. I guess it wasn't as it could effect what we're thinking too early, but the movie really doesn't waste any time either. It doesn't hurt having them at the end, I do think it is better served in the start though.If I do have an issue here, it is the aspects of Bobby. I like that Anne thinks that her son is haunting the house. This does help build the tension for the fact that as a viewer, we are questioning if it is him or not. My problem though is that Bobby has never been to this house. Why would she assume that his spirit would be there? There is a moment in the opening sequence where she wanted to know how the movers would know where to put their things. They wouldn't since this couple has never been there. There is also something at the end that I hated as well. It just feels like something they slide in for emotional impact. That didn't work for me in that way or really needed.I've already delved into the acting of the two stars along with the two characters that end up coming in support. I just briefly wanted to cover the others. Really the main one to talk about is Markham. Dave seems like a nice guy, but we soon see that he's not. I do think that the movie goes a little bit far though with making him be a bit too much of a twirling the mustache kind of villain for my liking. I do think that Gibney is solid. She really has a small role that doesn't come in until late in the movie. Neer does well at someone trying to do the right thing. It is ironic her character name is Cat when she is mousey. The rest of the townspeople are fine. I also thought that Guy Gane, Elissa Dowling and Zorah Burress do well in being the Dagmar family. They are entities, but how they play it are good.Speaking of the Dagmars, the effects in the movie are really good. The entities are burnt, which explains why it is so hot in the basement. I'm assuming there is a combination of CGI and practical effects to go into their looks. Whatever it was, I was on board. They looked scary, especially with their eyes as white as they are. Much of the movie is them standing in the background and watching over those in the house. That was effective for me, but I know it won't be for everyone. There is some really good practical gore as the movie goes on that really impressed me. I wasn't expecting it to go that route and what they did worked.Now with that said, this movie was one I had been putting off for no reason in particular, but I'm glad I finally saw it. The concepts that are introduced as this goes on and I think this is actually a good haunted house movie. The Lovecraftian elements work for me. The acting is good across the board and the effects were as well. There are a few minor issues that I had. The soundtrack didn't stand out, but it did fit for what was needed. To rate this movie, I'd say that it is a good movie for sure and one of the better modern haunted house films I've seen."
" Like A Burnt Marshmallow
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,3,"""That boiler almost killed my electrician."" LOL. This is not a horror movie. While they certainly nailed the retro, that's about it. There was definitely a mystery for me to solve though, but it concerned how I made it to the end. Frankly, I'm still pondering that and it may be one I will never be able to figure out."
" A pleasant surprise
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,6,"An old mortuary house located in the countryside covered with snow. A mid aged coupled relocates to the house after losing their son in a car accident. The neighboring old couple comes and tells about the first owner of the house The Magars who would run the mortuary but when they found out they were selling the bodies to the university they were punished and covered with tar and after that the father took her own life. The house was haunted by the father his wife and daughter. The psychic Couple who are friends with them visit them for the weekend to conduct a seance because the woman felt sth about the house. Their son and his girlfriend's killings were great. When they arrived the two couple were eating out downtown. Seeing the door at the note they entered the house and the son got killed in the basement and his girlfriend got killed with a crochet from the back thru her chest while driving away from home. When the women went downtown for groceries the guys conducted a seance and the psychisch visitor guy got possesed and he killed himself by poking himself in the eye. The villagers knew it was haunted and wants fresh blood so when they saw thy weren't killed they came to the house to do it by themselves and shot the visitor woman when she opened the door. The two found refuge up in the bedroom. Some villagers got killed in violent and bloody ways by the ghosts and it felt a little bit B movie at this point. They were completely consumed by the fire of the ghosts and become smoke. And the rest escaped but the owner of the restaurant downtown and the neighbor old man stayed. When she was approaching from the back Anne killed with with multiple knives in the throat. And then they went downstairs and the old
guy was there and he was killed by the ghost as well after he said they should be killed because they brought their sons spirit to here so they can live here with him forever. The ghost said they will be burning till the stars go dark. Then their son bobby Called their named from the basement and both looked pleased looking down in the basement and they probably stayed there.
Bloody gory scenes were pleasing and the sight of the ghosts were good. The scenes of the snow capped fields and the long road in the middle of nowhere felt really eerie."
" Excellent well made horror movie, deserves a part 2!!
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,9,"Really enjoyed this movie we purchased the hard to find 3d bluray and it was very good didnt have any earth shattering 3d but had some and the picture quality was excellent. Great story, great cast and decent effects overall a great movie worthy of a sequel!!"
" Recycled story. Good practical effects.
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,6,"Aside from a few jump scares, most of the effects are practical and that goes a long way. It was refreshing to have older characters as opposed to the endless beautiful young leads trope. Performances are very middle of the road."
" Good, with a little more effort it would be great
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,7,"Honestly the biggest problem here is the run time. Make this movie a half hour or so longer and build up the lore, the background and increase the suspense/tension of the film and we would have an 8 outta 10 maybe even an 9.
The theme is a pretty cliche modern horror theme. A haunted house right? But they did it a little differently and a little better than most as well as a little bit of throwback to the 70's era of horror. BUT it is still under developed because this story has potential and its not hard to see how this could of been outstanding rather than above average. They needed to build up the backstory of the house and make the movie longer to spread out the pacing and provide some more insight on the evil of the house so the film could have had more suspense.
Overall a good watch I recommend it and I am proud to have it in my collection of horror films because it is still really solid. It just could of been better."
" A movie out of time and space...
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,7,"We Are Still Here is paradoxically earnest and witty. There are a lot of reasons why you might enjoy the movie.It's a blend of intertextual reference and homage, love letter to the genre, and desire to live in the past. If it weren't quite so earnest, it would almost be a parody. It's Lovecraftian in that sense-being a work not of its time.The points where it departs from the reasons above are the points where it loses itself. The deep emersion in decades past are subverted a few times, and that does detract from the enjoyment.The pacing of the movie is...awkward in good ways. It's like watching a newborn giraffe stand up for the first time, and then suddenly blow up.Most of the movies effects are physical, but this makes the ones that aren't stand out enough to pull me out of the experience and land me in bad CGI land.Despite it's flaws, if your a fan of the horror genre and have any frame of reference for horror movies of decades past, its likely to be an enjoyable experience."
" Horrible acting
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,1,Special effects aren't good. Jump scares don't land. Acting is atrocious.
" These ghosts aren't messing around.
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,7,"A very high tempo, in your face haunted house film. You won't find subtle ghost scenes designed to inspire dread. This is a violent, gory film. There's too much blood and gore for it to be a serious film. Lisa Marie's performance is quite bad but the acting is decent otherwise. Just go for the ride."
" Way too much hype
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,5,"This movie is just ok. It's a fine watch, but very forgettable. Not sure why it gets high ratings, but everyone's entitled to their opinions. I'm so ambivalent about this movie, I can't even bring myself to recommend or not recommend. It's that middle of the road."
" Nothing outstanding and memorable
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,5,"The plot is very commonplace. Nothing surprises. Thousands of films have been made on the theme of haunted houses and this is not the most outstanding of them. The atmosphere in the film is addictive, but only until the appearance of the ghosts and mystical events themselves. Thus, the first half of the film is much more enjoyable than the second. The acting is also at a very average level. Not particularly annoying, but not delightful either. In general, the picture is not remarkable at all. Suitable for one time, but only for fans of the genre."
" Lots of holes
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,5,"The story could have been okay, but the ending left too many holes. So, I found it disappointing. I even thought that I must have missed something, so I read an article containing the entire plot. It, too, had the same unexplained holes in it. Too bad, too, because it could have been a good horror flick."
" Neat effects for a bit of a garbled film
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,6,"This is a rather minimal film for the most part. It hits us right away with some rather sudden and inexplicable ""haunted house"" events which turn out quite gory. At some point, the token Mr. Exposition guy gives an expo-dump on the new owners of the home about the Dagmar family that used to own it, how they were run out of town for some reason.
The family that moves in starts beginning to suspect that some of the Haunted House events are related to their deceased son Bobby, and so they gather up some friends to do a séance. This is when the film suddenly ramps up and veers less to horror and more to gore porn.
For such a minimal film, the effects are astounding. In particular, the makeup and creature effects. There's a constant adage about showing as little of the ""monster"" as possible so as to enhance its horror and it is always a safe bet to go with that move, as opposed to lingering too long and ending up with the monster falling flat due to outdated effects or just giving us enough time to adapt to the sight of it.
Here, whatever and however they did the ""monster"" effects, they are stunning to look at, even with the camera lingering on them for several long seconds. Impossible to tell if it's CG, practical effects, or both.
The main problem I had with the film is that there was no clear story involved once it got past the séance part. There was some background lore that began to rapidly come into place, but it all started to come in too fast and too suddenly that it felt very much like a last minute addition."
" Blood splatter
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,5,It has a cool retro atmosphere that I wish they utilize more.The second half has some great blood bath scenes. Idk but it was kind of fun to see. It's reminiscent of the over the top Japanese movies.
" Interesting Film
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this intimate horror story. There is an umbrella of sadness over it which adds a heaviness to its tone and action. Many horror films that use a tragedy as a jumping off point often fall flat, because the actors' performances and photography don't live up to the writer's intentions. This film succeeds where those films fail."
" ""We don't need to find the darkness here....it's everywhere""
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,5,"I have to give this movie credit--it got a lot crazier than I ever expected to. When we first see the main characters at the beginning, I thought there was no way that I would care about anything that happened in this movie. Some old lady who lost her son moving into a new house? But then the fire monsters started burning people one at a time, and I was interested. Then, starting with the seance seen, things ramp up and don't let down til it's over. The townspeople descend on the home to kill the couple, but the fire people straight up burns all of them. Did they let the couple live because the dead son Bobby talked the burnt ghosts into leaving them alone? Not sure, but it was worth a watch."
" Not worth watchin
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,4,"Clichés, not satisfying, mediocre acting, nothing exiting happens. Your typical ghost ""we-are-not -dead-because-we-were-wronged"" - story."
" Truly great modern horror
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,8,"One of the very few actually good and well crafted ghost/mystery movies of recent years with creepy Lovecraftian undertone.
If you are tired of Insidious or Annabelles you will enjoy this one as its made with passion and respect to the genre."
" Haunted house boredom
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,4,"Good Idea but badly executed, the acting is just awful and it looks low budget too, if you fancy a haunted house film, look elswhere"
" Bleh
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,4,Some cheesy effects but really some decent gore. A bit plot lite. The end to me didn't make a lot of sense really. In fact changing the score to a 4. Very mediocre film.
" haunted house movie
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,7,This is a haunted house movie that is not only smart it actually works and is entertaining to watch.
" A modern retro nightmare...
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,9,"Grief!! Searching for answers after the death of a loved one can be painful. It does not help that when you slowly come to realise that the house you have just bought and moved into, is also searching for something. This, to any non millennial is what storytelling in horror should be!! To those of you who remember the Changeling with George C Scott, you may feel the warmth and cold dread that movie instilled. To me, this is a masterpiece of a movie. A little house by the cemetery and a lot of other great elements. The setting is eeriest, sound design and the aesthetics are just what I love in slow burn horror."
" Modern horror with a retro feel.
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,8,"I have to give credit to finding this movie where it is due. If not for YouTube's Good/Bad Flicks, I never would have found this movie and I would have missed out on something special.There are a few modern movies that are filmed in such a way that they have a very retro feel to them. The Following and Mandy Lane come to mind. We Are Still Here follows in those same footsteps, giving us a very good horror movie with an 80s feel.The best part about this movie is the pacing. The horror is fed out slowly, piece by piece, the tension becomes tighter and tighter and the secrets revealed all in good time. All of this comes together in a final scene that delivers and satisfies.If you're looking for a turn off the lights, night time popcorn eating frightmare to kill a couple of hour with, I'd suggest you start here...then maybe check out Following and Mandy Lane."
" An unusual achievement...
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,6,"...a movie that somehow manages to be slow and yet too short at the same time.To be fair, it's nicely retro sort of horror, to the point I had to pause just to make certain it wasn't an older movie (though I suppose Barbara Crampton's age should have given it away, I didn't actually recognize her at first.) The filmmakers did a fine job of capturing '70s atmospheric horror. What they should have tried harder to avoid was the semi-episodic feel of much of '70s horror at the expense of character and plot development, though. There were simply some questions that needed answering regardless of how insistent you are on having ambiguity. In the end, many actions of the various characters made no sense without at least a hint or two as to the backstory. This is not intended to be a spoilery review, so I will just point to the fact that certain deaths were inexplicable, and certain aspects of the ending seemed almost random when viewed in the context of previous behavior. The '70s were an amazing era for certain types of atmospheric slow-burn horror, but the good movies didn't leave quite so many inexplicable aspects still dangling at the end.I'm going to give it a 6 out of 10 for the faithful replication of that era's horror, and the imperfect replication of that era's plotting and exposition."
" Another Haunted House Movie
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,3,"When you know you're making a movie that's been done thousands of times before, don't you stop for a moment and say to yourself lets try something different? The Others did it. This movie did not."
" my notes
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,1,Worst movie ever. terrible and eventually laughable. critic reviews make no sense. this movie was straight garbage. i almost stopped it after 20 minutes. made me wonder why i would've added this.... because the trailer is awesome and you can make an awesome trailer out of a terrible movie (1 viewing)
" Really odd horror, but clever and enjoyable
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,7,"You expect this movie to go one way, a slow reveal ghost story, but instead it goes in a decidedly odd direction. It's refreshing. Things start happening within the first quarter hour, and then escalate. There is 'breathing space' between the escalations. It's fun and interesting rather than scary, enough though to keep one engaged. Is that a good thing? Odd soundtrack too, as if the sound designer thought this was an arty indie movie about a love affair or coming of age, but luckily found time for actual horror buildups and crescendos after realising the mistake. OK, that sounds weird, and it is, but strangely I really enjoyed the movie all the way through. We Are Still Here has two things really going for it. The cinematography is superb, and really, really icy, and is given judicious pause at apt moments. It's really good, even if slightly at odds with the interior scenes. The filmmakers certainly picked a brilliant location, and were lavish in their use of their surrounds. There's a real talent there. And then there is the finale. Wow. OK, I'm out of comment without spoilers. One to enjoy for its uniqueness and fresh vision. We Are Still Here will never be a TV series, but it could be inspiration for a big budget production some time in the future."
" Uneventful and boring. Don't waste your time.
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,1,"Doesn't deserve ANY positive reviews, definitely one of the worst movies I've ever watched! Boring, nothing really happens until the end then they throw a bunch of gore in there thinking that that makes the film exciting and makes up for how boring it is, only making it more confusing and meaningless. A dumb film that made no sense, had no storyline and was just flat out dumb."
" It Doesn't Deserve Your Time
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,1,Don't waste your time..same boring old house Horror story..very bad acting..poor effects .
" Badly written / Clumsily directed / Poorly acted
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,2,"Existing neighbours come to visit. Their arrival at the front door comes across as bad direction or bad acting, but probably both. When the door is opened, the husband of the visiting pair says to his wife ""I told you there was someone at home"". The way it's put across is so contrived and not believable.The bottle of whisky looks just like the J&B brand. However, the label has the logo inverted as B&J...! Very curious.Monsters in the basement... come on!!! What a load of nonsense! Why can't filmmakers realise that the scariest things are things unseen. To blatantly show monsters and demons in full physical apparition, that can physically interact and cause harm to humans, is not scary in the least... it's just silly, bloody, gory and daft.They're witnessing a demon or whatever possessing their friend, the phone rings in the other room and, spontaneously, they all rush through to pick it up. Absolute joke. Laughable.There came a point near to halfway through, at which I could not stand any more and had to just scan through the rest of it.Whoever wrote this trash really needs to go back to writing school, *and* start reading some classic movie scripts to get some sort of idea on how to formulate decent content. The same goes for the director (for the 'actors' and 'actresses' I fear it's too late).Shocking acting. Utter rubbish, a complete waste of time."
" Cheap but ultimately entertaining
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,6,"A horror movie clearly made by horror fans, We Are Still Here suffers some from its lack of budget but ultimately delivers a strong payoff on its sinister premise. In the early, quiet portions of the story, awkward dialogue, actors and props selected primarily for their association with the horror genre, and inconsitent camera techniques, which waffle between tranquil tripod shots and jarring handheld movements, lend a cheapness to the film. However, well crafted monsters, high quality horror effects, improved dialogue, and disturbing exposition surface with increasing frequency as the movie nears its strong but grisly climax."
" ""Oh! Now, This Is Livin'!""...
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,8,"Ex-city dwellers, Anne and Paul Sacchetti (Barbara Crampton and Andrew Sensenig) move into their new, rural home, attempting to start over after the loss of their son. While barely unpacked, some small, but nonetheless odd occurrences begin. Anne believes their son might be somehow behind it. Paul believes no such thing.Upon meeting two of the neighbors, they're perplexed by their highly unusual behavior. As time passes, it becomes clear that something is going on that seems to involve the whole town. More strange things happen, and Anne invites their friends, May and Jacob Lewis (Lisa Marie and Larry Fessenden) up for the weekend. The Lewis' are quite a pair of new age / stoner-types, and they arrive just in time to experience the darkness of the place. The Sacchetti's son and his girlfriend also show up. Horror and tragedy strike, secrets are revealed, an impromptu seance is held, and everything hits the fan!WE ARE STILL HERE is an effective ghost story with more than a few shocks and twists up its tattered, bloody sleeve. Great, modern horror with a retro style!Gorehounds, have no fear. There is much gruesomeness herein..."
" Waste of time.
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,1,"This movie is not worth your time. The acting is bad. The writing is worse. What is up with the couple? They just witnessed their friends and a dozen people being brutally gored to death and had no reaction to it at all. And the dumb husband just didnt give a damn that a man was pointing a shot gun at him, ready to pull the trigger at any given moment. And the plot makes no effort to make sense to the audience. And the biggest flaw is that the ""monsters"" are not scary. Their first mistake was showing them upclose and in detail, which totally kills any fear because you realize youre just looking at actors in black makeup and contact lenses. The second mistake was that the ""monsters"" were too humanized, basically they just made them angry humans. And on top of that I still have no idea what their intentions were, why were they helping them in the end? The only thing that could potentially make this movie likeable is the gore, except thats not a redeeming quality for me because I dont care for gorey movies. Waste of my time."
" 2 Stars for a Good Beginning
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,2,"This Ghost Story had great potential, but then the Slasher experts were hired on and the whole thing went to Hell in a hand-basket. I can't remember the last time I saw anything as silly as this movie. Skip this one unless you are so bored that watching peeling wallpaper has lost its, well, appeal. We move from tense atmosphere and the setting up of a good Ghost Story to zombies from Hell squeezing people's heads until they burst like watermelons. Unbelievably stupid."
" Great scares, that's about it.
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,6,"I really wanted to get into this film for Halloween. I thought it would be a new classic horror film I missed but I was mostly wrong. There are some great effects, scares and atmosphere in We Are Still Here. Also these ghosts don't mess around, they kill and do it in brutal ways. I felt like I was watching a ghost slasher film at times. That's the positive stuff. Here's the negative:1. I disliked the cast, especially the main couple. 
2. Some of the acting just isn't good. 
3. The ending is all over the place. 
4. The house wasn't scary or very unique.I recommend this as a rental. I wouldn't watch it again though."
" A creepy treat.
",2018-06-20 00:00:00,6,"As the title indicates, you're in for a creepy treat! Bloody hell, this was scary! The scares start off subtle yet highly effective. It gave me gooseflesh more often than not! The very natural acting from a veteran cast ensures credibility. The music was effective, as well, and the visuals were utterly stunning. The scares are so effective without the help of overbearing music. In fact, at times there are no music at all and it was terrifying! 'We are still here' will no doubt go down as a classic!"
" Lots of promise, but fell a little short
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,5,"Really this move had a lot going for it in the first 15 or so minutes. Lots of time taken into filming the environment, great shots of the house and the surroundings, and great job with the sound design (lots of creepy/groaning adding to the house) really made it feel like a house that would creep you out. But the second the dialogue starts it just slowly starts going down hill. I understand not wanting to reveal too much too soon, keep the audience intrigued and guessing, but when it is so drawn out like this it really gets me bored and uninterested. I hated the acting by their older neighbor (the guy that ends up trying to kill them in the end) and the woman with the deflated lips. Poor casting for half of the people in this movie. The guy that gets possessed does a stellar job though, that was one of the saving graces of the film. The scene where he gets possessed is great. I did think the whole ""this house demands a sacrifice!"" thing was pretty lame. So, was the house haunted by the evil family, or was there a different evil in the house already? You can't have it both ways, if the Dagmar family was sacrificed to the house then it is the house that has the evil within it, or was the family themselves so evil that after they died they continued to haunt the house? And how do the townspeople know that every 30 years it demands a sacrifice? Theres just too many plot holes that make it seem like the concept and script was rushed through.Also the ending is a bit confusing. Why did the evil Dagmar ghosts not kill the couple? And somehow they end up seeing their son at the end? Is their son working with the evil family? Non of it makes sense but the overall movie wasn't too bad. Its somewhat entertaining but definitely not a movie you want to re watch."
" THE DARKNESS IS HUNGRY
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,6,"After the death of their son Bobby, Paul (Andrew Sensenig) and Anne (Barbara Crampton) leave the city and move into a rural home in upstate NY (note license plate) near Boston (note newspaper article). Anne ""feels"" Bobby in the house and invites her medium spiritual friend up. By the time they get there we hear the place is haunted by the Dagnar family and even see one or two. The Dagnar were the original owners.The film opened up interesting and ended as a ""b"" film with an exploding head and blood splattered all over the place. The ending was a bit disorganized. We saw the whatever too soon. I would have placed those newspaper clippings at the beginning of the film instead of the end. It is okay to give the audience a clue.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. How much does a Cecil Cooper autographed baseball goes for and why would a NY/Boston? fan have that instead of one from the home team? How about a Bill Buckner baseball with a scuff mark?"
" Not as bad as some suggest.
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,6,"Minutes 10 - 14: Kinda mundane. Husband and wife take a road trip to move into their new home, hear some things go ""bump"" in the night, blah...
After that the plot develops quickly, new characters come into play and the story line moves at a decent clip.
Contrary to the reports of other reviews, I found the acting to be better than adequate for a ""B"" movie.
Solid ""B"" horror.
Acting: Better than many ""B"" movies.
Special Effects: Better than many ""B"" movies.
IMHO"
" Skeletal and somewhat flat, but with a fun climax that elevates it.
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,6,"A modestly fun throwback horror film, though the bulk of its run time feels to be merely in service of its climax. The last 15-20 minutes of this film are pretty great, blood-soaked entertainment that recall the practical effects horror era. The film as a whole though ends up feeling slight and skeletal. I'm generally a fan of slow burn horror that builds to an explosive climax, but the simplicity of the story and overall flatness of the characters gave the build an inert quality that didn't generate as much intrigue as it could have. There was also an over reliance on jump scares for the first two acts, which is never a preference of mine and felt a bit at odds with the throwback quality of the film. Still, there's fun to be had here and the climax of the film mostly justifies the rest of it... mostly.Decent 3/5"
" Fulci influenced horror
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Anne (Barbara Crampton, Chopping Mall) and Paul are getting over the death of their son Bobby, so they decide to move to quiet, rural New England. But the moment they enter their new house, Anne claims that Bobby is there and Cat, their neighbor, tells them to leave.Turns out that their house was once a funeral home, where the Dagmar family sold corpses and buried empty caskets before being chased out of town.Anne invites two spiritualist friends, May (Lisa Marie, The Lords of Salem) and Jacob, who hope to help her contact Bobby. Their son is due to arrive later, but as soon as he gets there, he and his girlfriend are killed by whatever is inside the house. The couples are at dinner, where everyone in town treats them with suspicion. That's because the house needs to be fed every thirty years or the evil inside it will seek out fresh souls and destroy the town.A seance leads to all hell breaking loose, with the spirit of the father of the Dagar clan possessing Jacob and revealing that the villagers used his family as a sacrifice. The other townspeople come to the house to kill everyone inside, only to be murdered by the vengeful ghosts of the Dagmar family before leaving the house, finally having found revenge.Anne and Paul walk into the cursed basement, then smile at the camera as they greet their son.We Are Still Here announced the arrival of writer/director Ted Geoghegan as a name to watch in horror films. And his influences are obvious - many of the characters in this film are inspired by Fulci's The House by the Cememtary. I didn't expect much of this film and was pleasantly surprised by how fast it moves and how intense the gore gets. It's as close to a Fulci film as it seems we'll get these days."
" Spoiler alert. Haunted house story
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,1,This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was horrible and the story line was stupid and then confusing mixed with horrible acting. I was drunk when I watched this and all the alcohol still didn't make it better. I can't believe all the reviews of the people saying anything above 4 stars. Absolutely horrible movie. I wish I had that hour and a half of my life back. I really do. This movie was not scary at all.
" Strong Directorial Debut
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,7,"In the cold, wintry fields of New England, a lonely old house wakes up every thirty years - and demands a sacrifice.Let's face it: Barbara Crampton delivers one of her stronger performances, whereas the male lead delivers his lines in a very stunted way. He shall not even be named here. But good on Crampton! Far too many ""horror icons"" feel the need to phone in their performances, thinking their name on the poster is all that matters. And while it is true that Crampton's name does sell, she adds a great deal of value to her name here, in what may be her best work since the Stuart Gordon years.We also have a fun role for Larry Fessenden, who really deserves to have a little fun. Has any other creative genius launched more great independent filmmakers in the last decade? I would guess not."
" it has it's problems, but by the end it manages to have a very successful and heavy impact
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,7,"31 Days of Spookoween: DAY EIGHTFilm #8: We Are Still Here (2015)Review: ""We Are Still Here"" is one of those modern indie horror flicks that seem to be helping resurrect the genre. It is jam packed with obvious flaws and occasionally falls into the easy entrapment of cliché, but it makes up for these problems by packing a real punch in its climax and by retaining a sense of mystery and intrigue throughout. The atmosphere and silence of the film is golden, some sequences are brilliantly minimalist, and the cinematography is absolutely stunning! The special effects range in quality, but most of the gore towards the end is really fun and is pulled off very well, while the more tragic and horrific side of the film is never overshadowed by the possible silliness these effects could infiltrate into the film. The performances are mostly sort of mediocre, while some of them are quite good and others are pretty bad, but it doesn't harm the film all too much. Parts of it are so slow it becomes boring, but by the end I was grateful for this because it makes the wild finale all the more exciting! The concept, at first, feels very cliché, but as the film continues and plenty more twists and turns are established, it becomes a rather clever melding of various genre tropes that successfully come together to create a haunting and creepy premise in its own right. While not a very scary movie overall, there are certainly moments of tensity, which lead towards a final feeling of ""true"" horror. It's not really a masterpiece, but it is clear that the filmmakers behind this one have the potential to make a masterpiece sometime in the near future."
" Effective haunted house flick
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,7,"RELEASED IN 2015 and directed/written by Ted Geoghegan, ""We Are Still Here"" is about an aging couple (Andrew Sensenig & Barbara Crampton) who move to the quiet New York countryside after the death of their college-age son. Unfortunately, their fixer-upper is haunted by malevolent ghosts. Monte Markham & Connie Neer play their weird neighbors, the latter secretly warning them to GET OUT. Lisa Marie plays a medium friend of the couple and Larry Fessenden her stoner husband. Older haunted house movies turned me off to the genre, like the lame ""House on Haunted Hill"" (1959) and the better-but-dull ""The Legend of Hell House"" (1973); even 1999's ""The Haunting"" was relatively uninteresting (except the quality cast). The effective remake of ""The Amityville Horror"" (2005) changed my mind, along with films like ""The Grudge 2"" (2006). ""We Are Still Here"" is another quality movie in the genre. The film wisely takes its time to set up the mysterious ambiance, the protagonists and their situation while slowly building up suspense before all hell literally breaks loose. The possession sequence is particularly well done. THE MOVIE RUNS 84 minutes and was shot Palmyra & Shortsville, New York. ADDITIONAL CAST: Michael Patrick Nicholson & Kelsea Dakota play the college couple who visit the house and Marvin Patterson appears as the electrician.GRADE: B+"
" A modern horror story based on a retro recipe...
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,5,"When I came across ""We Are Still Here"", I was browsing through the horror movie selection. I had not heard about this movie prior to happening to find it by sheer luck. I noticed that Barbara Crampton was in the movie, and I did enjoy watching all the horror movies that she starred in during the mid- and late-80s, especially all the Lovecraftian movies that she starred in. So I decided to watch ""We Are Still Here"" without even reading the synopsis.The storyline presented in ""We Are Still Here"" is rather generic if you have grown up with horror movies, as I have. That being said, I am not saying that the storyline was bad, but it was just something that has been seen before in many other horror movies. Writer and director Ted Geoghegan did hit the nail right on the head, because the movie worked out quite well on many levels.As for the acting in the movie, well it was actually nice to see Barbara Crampton back on the screen in a horror movie such as this, because it definitely had roots in the classic way of making horror movies. It was also nice to see Andrew Sensenig, although I wasn't familiar with him prior to this movie, but he really performed well and added a great deal of flavor to his role and character. Monte Markham also made for a short appearance, and he is always a familiar face on the screen.""We Are Still Here"" has a good character gallery, as the characters are well-detailed and fleshed out on the screen. They have distinct personalities and traits. It was interesting characters that did add a good amount of worth to the storyline.The special effects in the movie were good, convincing and believable. The movie wasn't an abundance of special effects, which some movies tend to be. However, despite the scarcity of the special effects, the practical and CGI effects in the movie were functional, effective and to the point in bringing the storyline to life on the screen.The music score used in the movie was rather simplistic, but it worked so marvelously for the movie, because it was very atmospheric and mood setting. The music that accompanied the scenes really helped bring the setting of the movie and the atmosphere of the movie to life.All in all, ""We Are Still Here"" is an adequate horror movie, though it wasn't particularly scary. But it had a really good atmosphere to it."
" Suffers slightly from a surfeit of superfluous establishing shots.
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,7,"Having lost their son Bobby in an accident, grieving parents Anne and Paul Sacchetti (Barbara Crampton and Andrew Sensenig) move to the countryside, but discover that their new home holds a terrifying secret.As I am sure you are aware, establishing shots are used to set the scene, fixing the location and building atmosphere. For his debut movie, director Ted Geoghegan uses a lot of this kind of shot, not just at the beginning of a new scene, but randomly throughout his whole film, so-much-so that it actually proves distracting. The location is bleak and remote. It's cold. The building is creepy. I get it. Move on.Numerous pointless images of the outside of the house, gentle snowfall and barren trees aside, We Are Still Here is actually a fun little movie, its initial slow-burn approach delivering the chills, and a splatterific finale providing the thrills, gory highlights including a shotgun blast to the head, a crushed cranium and several knives rammed into someone's neck.Performances are little rough around the edges (although it could be the dialogue to blame), but that doesn't prevent We Are Still Here from being an enjoyable effort from a director who, if he can curtail his penchant for a superfluous shot, could well be going places.6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb."
" Lucio Fulci Lives! An Effective and Engaging Horror Story
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,9,"We Are Still Here is a modest, but great horror film. The tale displays a knowing nod to Lucio Fulci's The Beyond (but makes sense!) and presents an effective ghost story that builds up to a satisfying gore-filled conclusion. At one level, the story is somewhat familiar, and the haunted house with a 'dark secret' and 'don't go into the basement' tropes are all present and correct, but the novel 'protective' ghost angle gives the story an original edge and, crucially, an emotional core (as evidenced by a subtle but effective final scene). Furthermore, the cinematography is crisp and not only visually establishes the remoteness of the Sacchetti's house, but captures its glacial milieu. For some, the lingering exterior scenes may slow the narrative down, but for me they added to the richness of the story and help to reflect the grief that lies at the heart of the story. In the final analysis, then, Ted Geoghegan is a talent to watch and I look forward to seeing his future work."
