" Guns, Action and a lot of Mayhem.
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,8,"First and foremost, if you like action movies you'll love this. Go and watch it. Now, for the review:
Hardcore Henry is an underrated movie and a rather hidden gem, it takes some risks most of which pay off in the end . It is one of the most unique movies that I've watched recently. Sharlto Copley is just amazing in his role (s ?) and others while not amazing are alright in their roles.Now, for the story. Hardcore Henry doesn't have a groundbreaking or an intricate story but it doesn't need one. Its story is more of a reason to keep the mayhem going , while its not good, its serviceable. The humor and jokes are very well executed and it does get a bit bonkers in some places.Action and gunplay is the movie's biggest strengths, despite the limitations of using a first person perspective camera in a movie it is just as good as any of the blockbuster action movies. And first person perspective in a movie isn't really something that I've come across often (or even once for that matter). With all this being said the movie does have shaky camera in the first 30 mins so if you're prone to motion sickness or find it a bit annoying it is something that you'll have to deal with but it gets better post 30 mins, so sticking with it is the key."
" Only thing going for it is it being POV
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,4,"It's POV is the only thing going. Very bad storyline, and not worth a watch overall."
" !ELECTRIFIED ADRENOCHROME!
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,8,"A pulse-pounding soundtrack pumping the adrenals into hyperdrive overload. Combat/survival, h@rdkÃ˜r parkour! The 1st person ultra-realism of the in-your-face slaughterfest of gore had me wondering if this was maybe a psychotic RÃ¼sskiy with an HD Minicam stuck to his forehead in an actual tech-mob, violent, Russian society. A hyper-realistic, first-person, action/adventure/shooter, VR perspective.... well, that's just the sense I got from this killer, wicked flick!I'll definetely be checking more from director,

" When Film and Video Games collide
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,"This ended up being quite a surprise for me. I was expecting Hardcore Henry's First Person POV Gimmick to outstay its welcome, but it really made the whole experience insanely entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat. The stunt work is cool and the movie really felt like you were playing a Video Game. Great music also fits well with the action, and there's a good variety of locations.Despite these positives, it's not perfect. The story isn't the most amazing thing in the world, there's a lot of contrivances and things happening out of thin air, and the acting is a bit wonky here and there. Some of the CGI is a bit dodgy too. Regardless, this is a very unique experience and more of a rollercoaster ride than a proper narrative film. It works for the most part on what it sets out to do.7.5/10"
" Taking risk and trying something new.
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,7,"Movie trying to do something new. As an FPS game lover I liked this movie.
I hope the other movie makers can use blood and GORE elements much more like this movie."
" This should be in the Hall of Fame of Action Films
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,10,"I am reviewing this film by adressing the following message to it's Writer and Director:Thank You, Mr. Ilya Naishuller and your entire team, for giving us this unforgetable cinematic experience!
I will be patient. I know that You will make Us happy again in the next years.. Either with a part Two or by expanding the Henry's Universe. When i say ""Us"" , I am reffering to all of Us who CAN actually recognize a good ACTION film...I really hope a ""Raid 2"" type of miracle will happen in the near future, where You will get a bigger budget and blow our minds AGAIN!I don't want to see other copycats doing this kind of action films because they will most certainlly fail and fail big time, and the Studios will back off even more...
So, I will be patient.10 out of 10 stars"
" gamestyle brutal movie
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,10,"I loved every minute of it, if you like video games, u will love this!"
" Duke Nukem Reprise
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,2,"I can't really tell you if this movie is good or bad. Is the storyline worth your time? It's a big ""I DON'T KNOW"" (... though I suspect the latter).After 15 minutes past in, just couldn't stand one more. Too tiresome!Give me my painkiller, please!"
" quickly loses it's thrill
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,6,This movie does have some amazing action sequences and stunt work but the first person shooter camera make's the movie way less thrilling and exciting and feel's extremely unnecessary and doesn't do anything for the movie besides' annoy the viewer and make them dizzy. The lack of plot and dialogue may annoy some viewers even though it didn't bother me so If you want a story your definitely in the wrong place but if you a non stop action fest with endless violence and carnage than this is an a fun watch for you.
" Unique, inventive and much more interesting than you might think
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,7,"A film that is far more interesting, original, funny, inventive and raucous than the trailer would lead you to presume. I put this off for a while thinking it would just be a rote action thriller, with just a eyeball POV.Not exactly. Overall I applaud the directors and writers - this was a much more fun ride than many other action moves. It doesn't take itself too seriously, is quite funny (in a macabre way of course) at times, the action and gore don't hold back. It is definitely unique."
" Hardcore henry
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,9,"I love this movie, it has a lot of blood, action, more blood, video game first person, a lot of jokes and good special effects. Something different. Something that you should watch."
" Probably not a good flick if you easily get motion sickness.
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,8,"But damn, is this film good. It basically takes a gimmick and runs with it, and surprisingly pulls it off as well. This films is basically like porn in some ways: You come for the action and stay for the plot. The plot being Jimmy. Jimmy is great.There also was a crossover with Payday 2 a long while back making Jimmy a playable character. Funnily enough, this means that this film is set in the same universe as John Wick, Reservoir Dogs, Hotline Miami and Scarface. It's a confusing mess, but I think it adds a lot of flair to some loosely connected films.So yeah, go watch this film. And if you start to get dizzy and nauseous during this movie, congrats. You're now officially diagnosed with motion sickness."
" good idea, bad implementation
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,3,"The movie starts very nice and interesting, and initially, I was even surprised why this movie got such a low score. Then, 20 minutes after it becomes a bad FPV with nothing new going on the screen. One would also ask: ""Man, what did you expect? It is an action movie. Enjoy fights and shootings"". Nope. Take, for example, a good shooter game like Half-Life 2: it engages you, introduces new types of enemies, makes you think, and never gets boring. Same here, it is like a bad video game that you want to deinstall after the first dozens of minutes you watched. The authors had such a good and fresh idea in mind, but they failed to implement it."
" game natural
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,10,Original and unique - who created this have to create some game already - it's awesome !!! ðŸ˜€ so many visual effects challenges - and nicely done - and that natural jokes are perfect ðŸ˜†
" Hardcore - one of the best films shot in Russia for the last 10 years
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,9,"Hardcore - one of the best films shot in Russia for the last 10 years. To shoot completely the film from the first person a great idea, to watch the movie through a a VR Headset cool. There is no plot, characters play plainly, but the action from the first person is magnificent."
" Mayhem to the max!
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,10,"This is a breakthrough action movie in the same sense that 2001, A Space Odyssey was for science fiction. Non-stop violence practically from start to finish, with everything seen from a first person point of view (recorded by Go-Pro cameras). Henry is a newly-minted bionic man trying to save his wife from the clutches of people who can best be described as intensely anti-social. That is essentially the plot, but the plot is overwhelmed by a steadily building body count, snippets of humor and irony, and amazing feats of derring-do.'Amazing' actually doesn't do justice to some of the stunts made for this movie, a surprising number of which were performed by the actors themselves, rather than stunt professionals. In fact, behind the scenes accounts of how Hardcore Henry was made is nearly as fascinating as the movie itself, which is saying a lot! Example: They really were running atop those bridge girders. No FX, and no safety lines. Welcome to the world of PARKOUR.HH was supposedly made for just two million dollars. Maybe, or maybe the accountants were just as creative as the people who produced this excellent movie."
" Memorably mediocre
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,3,"The first I heard of 'Hardcore Henry,' maybe a couple years or so before release, I'd seen a 3-minute trailer online that didn't make a good impression. It immediately struck me as a novelty, with all the production value, writing, and style of a 1st-generation PlayStation first-person shooter, a la ""Medal of Honor.""Of course I gave the full-length feature a try anyway, eventually. And, well... you're almost just as well off sticking with the trailer, as it's a pretty accurate indicator of how the rest of the finished movie looks.It's true, what other reviews have said--you should honestly know exactly what to expect going into this movie, and it doesn't ever pretend to be anything it's not. I'll admit that it was better than my rock-bottom expectations: the trailer told me to expect an absolute pile of crap, but at least there was enough going on here to keep me engaged.Between the camerawork and script, the style recalls a mixture of first-gen console FPS games, where one controls the movement and actions of your character, and arcade-style FPS games, where the camera shifts and you're expected to simply fire at anything that moves.And about that camerawork--it's as shaky, and disjointed, and of the precise quality you should expect, being filmed from the first-person perspective. It fits the movie, obviously, but no one will ever be showing this in film school.The script? If 'Hardcore Henry' were a conventional film, it would be serviceable, but no one would bat an eye otherwise. But being a film specifically modeled after videogames, I guess I have to give credit where it's due: the writers successfully connected the dots. And that's just it--not to overlook the contributions of anyone else on the cast or crew, but if there's anything notably positive to say about this movie, it's that it's a dead-ringer for a FPS game. A generic one, but Entertaining Enough, I guess.You're not playing this game, mind you. It's more like a ""let's play"" video where the experienced player knows the precise timing of everything in the game. There's nothing new or original, but still just enough to keep you engaged to the end.I don't think I'd say that 'Hardcore Henry' is outright bad. It's just not interesting enough to be noteworthy. The villain/his plot are generic videogame cliche. Some action scenes (especially as seen in advance trailers) are extremely rigid and formulaic. The sum of the parts is okay, but there's nothing we haven't seen before, so why bother?When I watch something that I ultimately don't enjoy, I try to remind myself that no one sets out to write a bad movie. There's a lot of work that goes into any given piece of media, and if one doesn't like what they've watched, it's not necessarily altogether bad--you're probably just not the target audience. And that's okay. In the very least, working on any given project put food on the table for X number of people, so unless it's specifically, objectively harmful--who cares?What it comes down to in the end is that the first-person perspective, while novel, isn't enough in and of itself to carry the movie. The question to ask yourself before watching this is how much you like first-person shooter games. If you can't get enough, 'Hardcore Henry' is the movie for you. If you're anything less than a rabid fan--meh."
" Best movie
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,10,Best movie. Watch it now. I would recommend it to anyone who likes any first person games or anyone who likes any type of action.
" Good if you know what you're getting
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,6,"This is basically a first-person shooter video game put on film.It's a lot of fun if you know that going in. If you're expecting anything more than hyperkenetic eye candy, you'll be disappointed."
" Brilliant
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,8,"REVIEW - HARDCORE HENRYIf you're a console player you'll be familiar with first person shooter em ups if not I'll explain.Many games these days involve you walking around and shooting people and your point of view is through the eyes of your character.Imagine this experience as a film.From start to finish this film is simply action overload, every scene having stunts and action of which I've never seen before.Very original film taking the particular point of view but simply I was sat on the edge of my seat from start to finish.This film would have been a 10 but for 2 points which actually spoiled the entire film for me personally;1 the blonde baddie was just simply annoying,
2 the helper was also simply annoying.Please make more of these films because (except for the 2 points above) this film was stunning, enjoyable and a great film of fun.Rating 8 out of 10"
" ""Don't touch that! ..Emma Jeans mine""
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,7,"This was my second time watching this movie since it's blu ray release date in 2015 and it is a little better the second time around. Not much, but the peoblem with this film is the sum of its parts. First of all the fact we dont see Henry's face through out the film makes the viewer have to come up with their own idea of who he is. Now, at least 10 different people played Henry in this movie and i get you cant disclose his face too much due to the nature of the stunts being performed but there should have still been a look for Henry wether it be something we see on a screen in the opening of the film or the occasional reflections. Sort of like Franck Khalfoun's ""Maniac"" 2012. In the end of the movie we do get a glimpse of Henrys face but by this point it is too late fir the audience. Half of the audience had walked out due to the immensely fast pace while the other half are glued intently with smiles on their faces. To me, the pacing was just TOO fast. I love the concept but there should have been a bit kore restraint on the pace of the film. I would say pace of the story but there isn't much story to speak of. This movie has a near invisible story line that doesn't ever spread ita wings. Instead we get one man running like a banshee and killing hundreds of people. I didnt like how there were bad guys everywhere Henry went. He needed a bit more down time. There is a dude smoking a joint with a girl in his flat while there are 20 of Akan's men infiltrating the building. Its uber unrealistic but that's also what the first time director was going for. The actions scenes are frantic and fast but the kills are still quite clear and fun. At first glance this movie seems like it completely settled in CGI territory but then you take a second look.and realize that much of what is going on is actually done with lots of practical effects accompanied by some well placed and well timed CGI. It may appear that this film has cheap aspects like how the cell phone GPS image seems to be nothing more than a sticker at first for example. Every body knows that whichever direction a person is holding a cell phone whether upside down or right side uo, the screen will adjust to that angle. While in the city bus near the beginning, this was not the case. The phone screen did not adjust to the angle it was being held and it also LOOKED like a sticker. Later when I saw the phone again I realized it may actually be some CGI, though. My favorite sequence of this movie is when Henry shuts down in the woods and Jimmy approaches as the hippie and fixes him with his girl toy beside him
The music was great and the vibe was just right. This director threw several nods at smoking pot which is quite cool. Simply put, this movie is exactly like a first person shooter game from the shoot out in the night club where Henry had to avoid shooting the dancers to the insane helicopter part at the end. Good violence but the pace is just too fast. Blink and miss it."
" Awesome
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,9,"The story is not good at all but the action is great, it makes the movie worth watching. Also love the first-person concept and soundtrack"
" ""FPS: Man With a Mission""
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,9,"Fantastic watch, will watch again, and highly recommend.This is one of the most unique and interesting sci-fi action movies I've ever seen. Doing the entire movie from first person perspective is an amazing feat all on its own. If you watch carefully, then the cuts are really subtle if they even exist in places where you would expect them to be. There are a few points of lost consciousness, but those are the more obvious ones.Because it is a ""First Person"" movie, Andrei Dementiev literally carries the movie through the camera, but Sharlto Copley (""District 9"") is the repeating character that helps drive most of the movie, so he would be the traditional carrier, as opposed to the mute camera. Danila Kozlovsky and Haley Bennett give great supporting roles as well.The problem with the main character being ""super powered"" is that they need drawbacks to balance their benefits so they can ""power creep"" to match / exceed the villain by the end of the movie, and this follows that formula really nicely and in unexpected manners, unless you've seen ""Crank 2: High Voltage"".It definitely makes it immersive and enjoyable, and there is even a very well written plot happening."
" Ignore the ratings this movie is great fun
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,8,Crazy movie. The first person point of view takes some getting used to and I'm not sure if there wasn't a better movie to be had with a more conventional format. But it moves at a frenetic pace with action and comedy a plenty and Sharlto Copley puts in a super entertaining and suitably over the top performance.
" Criminally Underrated, Incredibly Enjoyable
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,8,"Hardcore Henry is one of the first of its kind, blending the world of video games and movies it is set entirely in the first person. It being a test for the kind of movie it is, it has a lackluster story, that often you forget what it's even about, but that is made up for by the outstanding action, comedy, and surprisingly good acting present in all the characters. Hardcore Henry may not be the best thing to come from the film industry in the past 10 years, but it's one of the more enjoyable films to come out, and it is exciting to see what more will come from this genre in the future"
" I can't believe I had never heard of this movie...
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,10,"All I can say is: Brilliant. It is definitely reminiscent of Crank. I happen to enjoy different, and this movie exceeded my expectations and then some.
The character Jimmy is just as entertaining, if not more so, than Henry.
It took me a minute to catch on when Jimmy would get killed and show up as another character. Great acting job there, btw.
Personally, I would love to see this movie made into a FPS. I'd buy it. You can always expand on the story in a game, and you already have so much to work with.
For the people who didn't like this movie, I'd love for you to explain why. It's not the greatest movie I've ever seen, not even the best action film, but when a movie actually leaves an impression on me after it's over, then it's a good movie.
I won't put any spoilers in here, but I have to wonder whatever became of Henry after it was over...?"
" ""The gayest jacket Ive ever seen!""
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,6,"Its a fun and exciting, but weird, game-like experience that Hardcore Henry offers, which I've never seen wielded on film before. With a massive flood of inventive qualities. Its also very amusing with the references it draws and the scenes it contains. The visual and the CGI is surprisingly well made and was actually amazing in execution. Its first-person look is awesome and quite exciting to see in film. The story isn't, from a film-makers narrative standpoint, very impressive, but goes well in hand with the first-person view and the films action filled story. But the point of Hardcore Henry isn't the story, the point is the exhilarated Hardcore blast of just unbelievable action, its ridiculous precise choreography, its mindblowing splatterpunk violence with a awesome sick humour to it. And in that area, I think Hardcore Henry has succeeded very well in."
" This movie has so many firsts for any movie ever made.
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,8,There are so many I can't possibly list them all so I'll just mention one. It has 50 or more women acting in it and they're all blonde. That's got to be a record.
" a first-person action movie
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,5,"I have two warnings for those who decide to see 'Hardcore Henry', the first and the only feature film made so far by Russian director Ilya Naishuller. It's an action movie, but it's not an ordinary one either, it's a first-person action movie. The story is told from a perspective similar to that of a player in command of a first-person shooter (FPS) video game and those unfamiliar with this type of games or unprepared for this experience risk ending the viewing with a serious headache, if they have not given up watching after 10 or 20 minutes. The second warning is for those who hate violence on screen. It's one of the most violent movies I've ever seen. The convention is clear, we are in a movie designed as a game, but even so, I do not recommend to those who avoid 'tough' movies to see 'Hardcore Henry'. Those who have after all decided to watch the film despite my warnings may be enthusiastic by the end. Or very disappointed. In a way it is a unique experience, for better or worse. But at least if they've read this far, they're all warned.The story is more of a pretext. The hero of the film wakes up after a traumatic event, his memory seems to have vanished, and soon we realize that he himself is or has become an android robot or maybe a human-robot hybrid. Thrown (literally) from a helicopter into a modern, dangerous and violent Moscow, he will have to understand who he is, to distinguish between enemies (a lot) and friends (a few), to look for and save the beautiful blonde who told him that she was his wife, and especially to survive having at hand the whole arsenal of the FPS video game players.I don't know if the hero of 'Hardcore Henry' has finally figured out who he is, I have not in any case. But I don't think it's important. The focus of this international production is on the visual experience and we witness and take part in an exceptional cinematic technical performance combining acting, amazing stunts and graphic computerized effects. Everything is seen through the eyes of the hero, whose image we see only twice, in reflections. The alert montage gives the feeling of 'one-shot', although it is composed of separate scenes interleaved with 1800 CGI effects. The feeling of immersion is almost perfect, as spectators we are in a virtual reality show similar to video games with the addition of adequate soundtrack. Director Ilya Naishuller is talented and has a good command of the technical means. Interesting where he will go from here. One direction he already masters is that of action anticipation films. If he will decide to add different content and approach more consistent stories, it will be even more interesting."
" Gave me a headache
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,4,"I can play 3d full motion axis games, but I can't watch them. This is the second time I've tried to watch this but can't get more than 20 minutes or so in."
" While I enjoyed the action and stunts alot. The movie for me ultimately fell flat everywhere else.
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,6,"This movie is just one those movies where majority of people are either going to love it or hate it. I saw it with my brother and he completely despised it and thought it was the worst movie ever. While I wouldn't go that far, I diddn't think it was great either.Pros:-The movie features some of the best action scenes I've ever seen. As well some highly intense brutalized/stylistic kills.-The stunts pulled off by the main actors is just unreal. Some of the stuff they did was just so amazing and even though it was a movie I couldn't believe it.-Pacing and the length of the movie was good. Never did it feel sluggish and the movie wasn't to long either.Cons:-While the first person approach was interesting after awhile I found myself getting headache from the constantly bouncing around camerawork.-The plot to me wasn't very good. I tried to get into it and really couldn't. I felt it was all over the place. Also a a good chunk of it doesn't get explained till thelast 30 or so minutes of the movie. Sadly by then you're to confused to care.-I diddn't enjoy any of the characters at all. Henry has no lines, Copleys role was highly annoying, and bennett isn't feature that much at all. Which is weird because the plot mainly revolves around her. I also diddn't find the main villain interesting enough, instead found him highly cheesy.Overall its an okay movie. Would I recommend it? I personally wouldn't watch it ever again or tell close family about it. But if you're someone looking for something different its worth a try."
" FPS The Movie
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,9,"Any fan of video games should see this film. I personally found the plot and characters enjoyable, people may call it generic but the story and characters are better than what you find in a Marvel film and nobody complains there.Every sequence of this film perfectly represents different types of first person video game. There's a stealth section, a sniper section, a chase scene and of course more action than you could hope for. To top it all off you have your classic video game silent protagonist. People who dislike video games may not appreciate this, but that's ok, this film's not for you.I personally appreciated that the film was set in Russia. It's nice to see an expensive movie that remembers the rest of the world exists outside of America, much less the 'terrifyingly dark' former soviet union that most western people know precisely zero about.All in all, a solid movie that deserves a lot of love"
" Captivating thrill ride
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,7,"Hard core Henry does not let up, the action is so intense and drives the pace of this movie. The cinematography is unique and fun, though it can get a bit shaky cam. A fun thrill ride of gory proportions."

" OK, but could be better
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,6,"This is basically like watching a pro play a really good first person shooter game.what kills the immersion though, is that it is not continuous - there are cuts when the action skips forward a few paces, in order to fit all the plot in.that is totally unnecessary and distracting imho, everytime i started to get really immersed in being henry, a cut killed the immersion.it would have been better to drop half of the ""plot"" and at least half of the action scenes in order to get fewer scenes with less cuts. this way, it feels like they just wanted to cram too much in. a good FPS video game takes more than 90 minutes, but you don't have to do it all in one sitting..."
" Amazing Movie
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,"People really tend to give this movie awful because it seems generic. These guys made a first person movie, with a TWO MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET. Had they had a bigger budget, think of what this movie would have been then! I loved the movie, the twist, everything about it. Just amazing. The ways that Henry executed the people was gruesome, but so good. Overall this was just perfect."

" Unique
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,10,This is a one of a kind packed with action and fun.
" Action, Action and Action.
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,7,"Hardcore Henry is an Sci-Fi action movie directed by Ilya Naishuller and stars Sharlto Copley, Danila Kozlovsky, Haley Bennett and Tim Roth.This movie is a true paradise for all the action lovers and it seems that you are playing a video game. Gravity defying stunts filled with gruesome violence. The movie is fast paced and will keep you glued. The climax has a very special twist.This is one of the best action movie I have seen in the recent times. A must watch for all the action lovers."
" An interesting experiment, perhaps the first of many
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,7,"I have no doubt that other films which came before this one have attempted to pull of what Hardcore Henry pulls off. However, I do not believe that it's ever before been done on such a scale and with such fine results. The concept is nothing too spectacular. The film merely mimics a first-person shooter video game. However, the filmmakers here took that concept fully to heart, and their passion and commitment are what allow this film to succeed.With technology constantly improving and adapting, Hardcore Henry was made at a time when it finally could be made well. The first-person concept could have been done before with big bulky cameras, but here it was done with the lightweight GoPro camera which really allowed the cameraman to do all the crazy stunts and jumps we see without the camera getting in the way. The camera was designed for this stuff, with action sports in mind.I did read, however, that the cameraman had to wear a cumbersome rig on his shoulders for much of the time which caused him some neck pain. It's not noticeable for the viewer, however, so I guess that is just the price he had to pay to make this fun movie.Before watching it, I did have some concerns about the whole first-person shooter concept. I like the idea of a first-person movie and have been waiting awhile for them to make one, but a first-person shooter movie sounds just a bit too much like watching someone play a video game. I don't hate video games, but I think if I was ever to watch someone play a video game for an hour and a half I'd get pretty bored.The filmmakers did make some cool action music videos in the same style as this film before filming this, and I enjoyed those quite a bit. But once again, those were short form videos, and this is a feature, so I was still worried about getting bored. And to be honest, I did get bored at times, especially during one somewhat tedious sequence toward the end. Overall, however, those moments were few and far between.They did a good job keeping it entertaining with a lot of different kinds of action sequences and even some comic relief and a bit of drama. It did feel a lot like a video game, but not too much so and not in a bad way. The concept was mostly untested, but the final product was admirable, especially for something so daring. Maybe some other filmmakers will be inspired to try something like this but put their own spin on it. I'd like too see theme do it all in one shot, or at least blend the shots together to make it appear as one, the way that some films have done in the past.Maybe these guys will try something new that is equally daring, or try to outdo themselves in the same style. I'd like to see them expand on this concept. Maybe a first person drama? A prison escape film? Who knows what they'll come up with next, but I'm sure it'll be great and I look forward to it.Thanks for reading!"
" Just watched this gem, I know there are issues, but it is just as advertised!!!
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,10,"World first POV video, in reality Doom did it first, but this is a full featured beauty!
If you're thinking about watching this, you have a general idea what you are getting yourself into. Just enjoy this POW film and you just might see some boobies aswell"
" Awesome on a big screen with full surround sound.
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,8,"I watched this a good friend and we were constantly laughing. This was a really fun movie if you like non-stop action. You feel like your the main character and you see and hear everything from his perspective. You really need a proper theater or home theater to fully enjoy this, in my opinion. It just makes it a lot of fun."
" You may feel guilty for enjoying this, but enjoy it you shall
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"What this boils down to is pretty easy: a ruthlessly simple plot that merely exists to feed cool fight scenes. Of course, the main gimmick is the shooting style: we spend the duration in the first-person, experiencing the gunfights and tumult of a mute protagonist from a perspective just above the bridge of his nose. To my great surprise, the filmmakers are actually inventive and unorthodox enough to keep this from feeling stale. In fact, apart from the constant threat of motion sickness, it works marvelously. They're even able to play it for some great laughs, often conveying the action hero's frustrations and feelings in pantomime like a classic silent film. Its dramatic chops are not a strength - in fact it seems to be a film entirely staffed by stuntmen, students and models - and it gravely struggles when the fireworks halt (albeit briefly) to further the story. The main foil is a particularly egregious example, akin to Tommy Wiseau playing Julian Assange with telekinetic powers. Theater really isn't what this is about, though, and if you were expecting Shakespeare you may want to undergo a thorough cranial exam. As a playground for pyrotechnics, special effects, parkour and crazily original fight scenes, it delivers in spades."
" If you don't like gore, watch it for the skill involved
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,7,"Not many will know, but the skill involved in this movie is incredible.... Parkour, gun combat, clothes, set, characters, extras, writing, consistent morals (not shooting innocents), atmosphere, long goal story, accurate scientific/tech information... 90% of movies cannot get even one of these right.The only thing I didn't like was the fact that gore and running winds up being the majority of the movie, which means you can't rewatch it again for fun or to relax... A bond movie has got the right balance as far as that goes."
" Action from start until finish, but it's not the Godfather
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,8,"This is fun. The movie sets out to do exactly what it says it's going to do. It's non stop action in a format that, to my knowledge, has never been done previously. If you're looking for character development or a slow burn drama, look elsewhere. I enjoyed it a lot. Perfect for a hangover Sunday, with a pizza close by."
" A unique movie
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,8,This movie deserves higher rating than 6.7 because of its innovation in story telling.it's like a first-person action game giving the viewer a sense of being the hero of the story.
" I expected a generic action movie and I got so much more.
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,10,"My brother and I haven't laughed that hard in years. This movie constantly keeps you at the edge of your seat, waiting for the next twist or punchline. At first we thought it was just a generic action movie, however we quickly realized that was not the case. However, what we got was so much better. Even though it's hours since we saw the movie i'm still sitting here and laughing to myself, when i'm thinking about it. Whoever made this movie was on some sort of drugs and i'd love to have whatever they were having at the time.
10/10 an all time classic and definently a movie i'll show to my friends and watch myself again."
" This movie rocks!
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,8,"This movie should have a higher rating. It's got some hilarious points and at the start as you see what's going on you cant help but laugh but at the same time its genius. If you life some comic relief and a lot of gore; but gore that's much deserved; combined with action, adrenaline, a little touch of magic, and brains; you're in! Making this movie in first person like a video game was genius. Awesome!!"

" The Citizen Kane of action films...
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,8,"When is a movie not a movie? How do you rate a movie like this anyway?Hardcore Henry completely reinvents cinematic language. It's closer to a videogame in streamlined story and brutal, flinch-inducing violence. The sometimes low-res, often choppy POV is ballsy and cleverly conceived, gags and smart editing is commendable, the director's well-honed eye providing a true cinematic breath of fresh air.It has superbly apt, moody music and good directional sound, it's not nearly as cheap as the marketing led me to believe even though it's clearly on a shoestring, its inventiveness and good blend of stunt performers and FX create a non-nauseous, toe-curling adrenaline rush.There's admiration to be found in the lack of exposition in the 8-bit paper-thin plot and the gaudy, gonzo characters of a suitable Sharlto Copley. If you're in to videogames or appreciate something different, then Hardcore Henry is a revelatory, avant-garde, art-house action flick with its tongue in its cheek and its balls to the wall.
It's also a sadistic, nihilistic over the top collection of video game levels. Insanely creative and in incredibly bad taste. It's a gory riot, blackly comic and tells you exactly what it is upfront and never lets up. Many parts of this film are stupid, ugly, dragging and plain insufferable and then there's equal parts hilarity and visual wit, true kineticism and sheer stuntman balls.Very Russian. Not for everyone. And wears thin by the end, but very much a one of a kind and relentlessly intent on being it's own beast. And it helps that the ending is so absurdly laugh-out-loud OTT that it puts Crank to shame."

" I wanted to love it.
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,5,"As a big fan of Sharlto Copley, action, violence, gore, etc, I tried so hard to like this movie, but I just didn't enjoy it. I'm ok with first person POV movies (I really liked Kill Switch) and I don't get motion sickness, so neither of those contributed to my dislike.If I dissect Hardcore Henry, it has many ingredients that I love. But, it's like they added as much cool stuff as they could think of, whether it makes sense or not, even if it creates plot holes. One of my movie pet peeves is when characters start explaining to the viewers what's going on or what's happened in the movie (like the ending of Hereditary). When that happens, it means that either the filmmakers know they didn't get their point across, they've run out of time, they're lazy, unimaginitive, etc, so instead of showing us what we need to know, they have a character ""fill us in"". In this movie, that happens at least twice.I also didn't connect with any of the characters, so I didn't really care what happens to them, and a lot of them I found to be annoying.There were a couple of scenes that perked me up. The first one was towards the beginning, we see Henry doing some pretty cool maneuvers as he's trying to get from point A to point B, and the other one was towards the end and mostly attributed to the background music.I can't recommend this one. I was bored even during the ""good"" parts I should have enjoyed, and the movie felt 2.5 hours long."
" Good first person action
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,6,"I enjoy it, good parkour, action, shooting. I'd say ignore the bad reviews give it a chance, it's interesting. I saw couple of reviews said after 15 minutes head starts to hurt, but that was not the case with me, whole time no problems."

Things coming from Hollywood last few years have been all about ""political correctness"", meetoo and other political fractions painting political agendas, so to see a genuine idea getting done so raw and without any filters id amazing. Bring back the Charles Bronson, Chuck Norris ang Clint Eastwood.
Thank you."
" THE BEST VIOLENT FIRST PERSON ACTION SHOOTER MOVIE EVER!!!!!!
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,8,"Most people might say this movie is weird and not normal and just feels odd and i can understand those things and i can see where people are coming from, but i actually liked the movie and i thought it was unique and creative, something different that i really needed. The blood and special effects weren't the best but you most likely couldn't tell, and i certainly didn't care and besides most first person movies like Pandemic didn't have great special effects either but it was hard to tell that it was bad just like this one. Some of the scenes were wacky and weird but its kinda hard to say that because you feel like you are Henry so you feel like your there and you know those people. The action scenes are cool and there are a lot of chases and gunfights which are really cool. Sometimes when there are parkour and parkour chases it looks like im watching a YouTube parkour video but i like watching those so i wont complain. Sometimes it was kind of confusing and its hard to tell whats happening because of the camera movements but its really cool at the same time. Non-stop action though so thats a good thing, a lot of hand to hand combats. My dad called the people i n this movie sadists but i think he used the wrong word to describe them :p"
" interesting concept, ok execution
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,5,"Despite the obvious inspirations from other action movies, there some elements that make this film standout. I'm not only referring to the position of the camera, which to be fair, is kind of gimmicky and reminds me of a FPS game. The idea of watching a video game and removing its main charm (being its interactivity) might be kind of weird but it actually works out quite fine. The few cheesy jokes that are made in the film fulfill their purpose of being a contrast to the action and getting a slight chuckle out of the audience. The stunts are over the top, as in any action movie and, in my opinion, pretty cool.
I was surprised to see that the story became a little bit more than a reason to go to different locations. It actually has a couple of characters that seemingly pop in and out of existence, which is perfectly fine for this kind of movie. The characters are semi memorable. The 'semi' is mostly due to the fact that there isn't a lot of time spent talking, but as we all know: actions say more than words.
The editing is alright, I like the parts where two scene are seamlessly cut together, making me wonder which transitions where so seamless that I didn't pick up on the cut. At certain points in the movie, however, it does become clear that it isn't a Hollywood movie and 'only' had a budget of 2 million.
So, in short, watch this movie if you've watched too many James Bond movies and are willing to try something alternative.
7.5/10"
" Nothing.
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,1,"This is a nothing movie.Bad video games, usually have way more story and good characters than this.The irony we get in the end it's fine. But there a gazillion videos of parkour, all better than this.As a good thing that doesn't really make an impact, the blood and graphic violence is really great.Still. A nothing."
" Hardcore Henry flaunts its first person perspective in nauseating and chaotic action.
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,5,"Grind the enemy's face against a wall! Invert their spine by jumping on it through a small grating! Shoot their damn heads til they explode! Oh yeah, keep it going! Ahem. Putting aside the gratuitous violence that certainly warrants the highest certification available, the idea of a first person action romp sounds perfect in theory. Execution though? Perhaps not. I believe this type of technique is best suited to virtual reality, and even then chances are you'll projectile vomit as you pass out. A cyborg is tasked in assassinating a telekinetic megalomaniac who wants to create an army of super soldiers. Oh, and kidnaps his wife. Bad move!The concept is rather ingenious. Taking a GoPro sort of camera, attaching it to a stuntman and letting the havoc wreak from his perspective. This works solidly during scenes of basic dialogue and minimal action. However, when a mass hand-to-hand combat brawl commences for ten ridiculous minutes or whenever our mute protagonist performs some tame parkour, the camera technique is too clumsy and messy. The constant shakiness, abrupt cuts (unfortunately wasn't filmed in one whole take) and sense of disorientation, detracted from the blistering action that was depicted. A few scenes, like the motorbike pursuit or the mass defending of a cripple going down an elevator, work excellently. The other action sequences not so much, which is a shame.The story isn't exactly anything to write home about either. Essentially a video game premise where our hero must fight his way to the final boss. Functional, but hardly memorable. A surprising amount of comedy complements the action and had me chuckling on a few occasions, especially the end. This is mostly down to Copley's performance(s) who, hands down, saves this from being an incoherent bore-fest. Clearly, he had fun, and I for one could feel his joyous energy. As an action fan, I applaud the dynamic change in style. New, refreshing and innovative. However it's style-over-substance, and I personally did not like the style."
" A New Genre of Film Making
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the most enjoyable, watchable films I've seen in a long time. It takes about 5 minutes to get used to the FPS perspective, but once you do, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Sharlto Copley is a joy to watch, every character he plays (which is most of them) is spot on. A film like this would never receive any sort of major award nomination but Copley should have won something for his performance.The references made to the many video games like Mortal Kombat and Call of Duty is a testament to the directors love of that genre. After some of the kills, I honestly kept waiting for a booming voice to call out ""Fatality!""."
" Nice concept, but....
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,1,"The idea was good but it seriously lacks of quality. It's just very very boring. I kept watching, hoping for the big surprise but it just didn't come.

" Perfect action film
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie had everything you could want in an action film. It was just constant entertainment and at no part did I feel even remotely bored. It kind of reminded me of crank (the first 1 because the second sucked) with the non-stop action, mixed with a perfect amount of humor. It's way over the top, but it works as this movie doesn't take itself so serious. Anyone who doesn't enjoy this, shouldn't consider themselves action movie fans in my book."
" The most Badass film in a long time
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,9,"I ADORE Hardcore Henry, this is such a unique film with an amazing style and you can clearly see the people behind the film were having an amazing time creating this film. This is probably the closest thing to a video game movie we will ever get and it's not even based on a videogame. The story was it's weakest point but that did not matter when the action was jaw dropping and insane. I loved every minute of it."
" A neat idea that assaults the visual senses of its audience.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,4,"When the trailer for this movie came out, I had high hopes for this ""conceptual"" idea. With the increased popularity and proliferation of Virtual Reality (VR) headsets, I could see a film like this doing well in an immersive environment like VR. After all, the whole film is from the first-person Point of View (POV), so anyone wearing the VR headset would feel almost as if they were experiencing the movie from the main character's perspective. Granted, this film was not created for VR headsets, and after seeing it, I'm kind of glad that it wasn't. Hopefully, future filmmakers can take the lessons from this film and create better movies that could use the format to its best advantage.Up until now, the only time you'd see something in a first-person POV is in a video game. In fact, most ""first-person shooters"" (FPS) are ""filmed"" in this fashion to immerse the player in the game from their avatar's perspective. Of course, in a video game, the player has control over the character, which makes the sudden movements a little less nauseating. In Hardcore Henry (2015), though, there is no control. The camera shakes so much; I worry that the titular character is a bobblehead. While it follows the conventions of FPS games, the movie is almost too unsteady to watch.Of course, the Cloverfield (2008)-esque camerawork wasn't the only nauseating aspect of the film. The violence was quite graphic and explicit, almost to the point of ridiculousness. I've never seen people be killed in so many different ways or in quite as large numbers as Hardcore Henry managed to accomplish. Still, its intentional video-game styling made this film difficult to take seriously. The antagonists had almost unbelievable motivations or at least motivations that were slightly less believable than the eponymous main character's.A neat idea that assaults the visual senses of its audience, I give Hardcore Henry 2.0 stars out of 5."
" Good movie with a very low budget
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,10,I am 36 years old and i find the movie quite enjoyable. Great special effects done mostly with stunt doubles look better than in recent multimillion crap movies like Batman or Transformers. The movie should not be taken seriously - its a parody on all action flicks but have more charisma and irony then all of them combined. Great soundtrack and good acting. I left the theatre with smile and satisfaction...mission accomplished
" Perfect movie for pubescent boys who have just had their first wet-dream

" An intense and well crafted thrill ride
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,7,"Straight off the bat, I'd say this film is completely nuts and wears its videogame DNA proudly. Shot completely from a first person perspective, I give the director, photography and choreography team full props for their efforts in this film.The main times the shaky cam disorientation happens is during hand to hand combat, which was less enjoyable for me when compared to the shoot out scenes which are awesome and a lot more clear (though there is some really great hand to hand scenes). It also wears its R/18 rating with pride as it over indulges just about everything (which some viewers probably won't appreciate, especially with its machismo leanings)Sharlto Copley is the main actor throughout and this movie really allows him to shine with his wacky style and funny voice acting, which is great.The plot has a cool concept but nothing that special; really you should watch this film for the action and comedic sequences as they great, bar some dodgy CGI at times.Solid 7.5 / 10"
" Not too bad but nothing to remember.
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,5,"Hardcore Henry was all about that it is like an FPS game, and as a gamer I was curious for sure, even tho it took me about 3 years to actually find and have a look at it. What I found was equally ""Yeah this is okay, I guess"" and equally ""Why did I need to see this?""Hardcore Henry is basically a faceless mute protagonist like a lot of games have because you're meant to put yourself in the role of them, but with Hardcore Henry it all felt too sped up, it plays a bit like the kind of game where you can slow down and really look around you to plan ahead and such as Henry pretty much ends up using multiple weapons against multiple targets in multiple directions, a lot. But you really get little of the planning ahead, and it feels like a trailer in the sense of that everything that isn't action or story is cut away. Which leaves it to be mostly about shooting, fighting, blood and a little bit of story, which really was my main reason for the first half to look, not because there was alot about it, but because ""Jimmy"" keeps popping up over and over after having been seamingly killed. So I had to know, how is he coming back over and over? And they appear to be robot clones who he controls from a wheelchair, which ruins things a lot if you think about it, but that was the first half.The second half kinda got me hooked by simply having Jimmy play a lot of roles from Punkrocker to WW1 veteran and I feel like the movie was mostly made to have Sharlto Copley mess around on the screen as any amount of character types.A huge problem for me was the camera works, a lot of shots were blurry and felt like someone held a handcamera while others it was perfectly still just the way a movie is expected to be, but only during the storybits, of course. Every other time the camera kept flipping over, changing position, and I felt quite ill to watch it, it is not a good movie to watch. As an experience? Maybe.My score comes from actually having 1 = Terrible 5 = Okay and 10 = Incredible, and Hardcore Henry did nothing special for me and I was having a hard time finishing it."
" Most insane film making I have ever seen.
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,9,"This flick is completely off the planet. There has never been anything like it ever. Not only did I sit there shaking my head wondering exactly *how* they managed to capture that last shot every few minutes, I was also left questioning the legailty of what they were doing. Many of the scenes, particularly in crowded daytime Moscow public spaces, were simply jaw-dropping and I had the distinct impression that the random people caught up in the scenes had no idea of what was actually happening - just wrong place, wrong time. It looks like genuine guerrilla film-making where permission to shoot was neither requested nor even bothered about. Yes it's non-stop first person perspective with body cams on a bunch lunatic parkour crazies, it made me queasy at first, but the raw energy and utter insanity just swept me away. Do not expect a coherent story - this is pure anarchic energy from start to finish and it leaves Hollywood ""action"" block busters in the kindergarten from which they will never graduate. This film is just completely and utterly insane and I shudder to think of the injuries to both cast and innocent bystanders it left behind.

Put to things together to find out the final results. Hardcore Henry isn't a gimmick film. This is a film where the filmmakers love genre film and wanted to try something different. And their final result is a film that works well, so very well.I never ever thought I would be touting this film as much as I do now. Having multiple views behind me, I unabashedly love Hardcore Henry. The first person perspective is used to the best of its ability. It never hinders the film or the storytelling. It actually adds to the mystery of the film. The story is straight out of a video game, which makes sense because the film plays out like the best video game to movie adaptation ever. A man name Henry wakes up after an accident with new body parts help built by his scientist wife. When the lab is attacked by an evil organization and their all-powerful leader, who kidnaps Henry's wife, he's tasked with hunting them down and bringing her back.The story isn't too complicated but it does have layers. There a nice mystery element to it with a nice twist near the end. Because the entire film is from Henry's perspective he's not given anything to say. But what he goes through shows off some pretty fantastic film making. Sharlto Copley shows up as multiple characters are the highlight of the acting in the film. He just dives right into each personality full force. He goes from punk rocker to drugged out hippie to old ward vet with such fluidity and ease. I have heard that he is tough to work with onset but this man needs to be in more films. He's got the chops to play anyone. Tim Roth shows up in a cameo as Henry's one recurring memory of life before his accident.With this film thought the main reason to view it is the insane action scenes, some of which I have no idea how the crew filmed without someone dying. There is a bike/car chase in the middle of this film that is jaw-dropping. Where they go the camera to go and stunts they pull are so impressive. (Kudos to the stunt team because they are on point in every action moment) There is plenty of action to go around, chases, gunplay, hand to hand combat and even some fantasy elements that come during the bananas finale. Speaking of the finale, it has some of the wildest action moments in it with a final moment that I absolutely loved. It's the cherry on top of an excellent action spectacle.The film definitely earns its R Rating. It's extremely bloody and violent. The violence is almost to the point of horror film gore. People get blown away and die brutally. Paul Verhoeven would be proud. I don't know how director Ilya Naishuller, didn't get more work after this. How has Hollywood not snatched him up to make more wild action films? Or at least have him stage some crazy action sequences for other directors. Hardcore Henry is for the pure action film junkies. (I am one of them) It hit all my buttons with it's over the top action scenes, characters, story, and ending. I can't recommend it enough to people who just want to have fun with a wild action movie. My only regret is nothing seeing this in a theater."
" Fun
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,10,"This is just a really, really, really fun action flick. Basically, you get what you see in the trailer; nonstop action and madness. If anything, this film is underrated."
" Awesome!
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,8,It feels like you're in a match of call of duty the whole time which for gamers should be cool but if you don't play video games it might be less interesting. Overall great movie except if you're watching with somebody under the age of 12 make sure to cover their eyes when Henry crushes the guys ballsack and blood and nuts spill down his leg.
" An amazing movie, for some audiences
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie is, in many ways, absolutely fantastic. The entire movie is viewed, literally, through the eyes of Henry, a mute half-robot war machine with complete amnesia slaughtering his way through mercenaries to save his wife. If that doesn't sound interesting to you, I do not recommend seeing this movie. It is not for everyone- But for those it's for, it hits its mark perfectly. The stunts are incredible, the action is awe-inspiring and very well-paced. The story, while certainly leaving a bit to be desired, is actually half decent, as since Henry's memory is wiped, any confusion or suprise the viewer feels, Henry often shows as well.In summary, this movie has insanely good action and stuntwork, and is probably the absolute best movie on the market for people who enjoy that. For those who don't, this movie is not for you, and I would suggest skipping it."
" My favorite movie
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,10,"I love movies that are unique, and let me tell you this one is unique. If you're looking for a movie that is full of cliches and has a predictable ending, then find a different movie. This was an absolute joy to watch and I can tell this is one I'll be watching over again."
" The next mindless video game, perhaps?
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,2,"The billing for ""Hardcore Henry"" is action, adventure and Sci-Fi. But a better designation would be ""psychedelic video game."" I mean that seriously, not just as a put-down of the film. Not very far into it, one can plainly see that it runs precisely like an arcade video game. There have been any number just like it - non-stop action, a hero (you, the player) dodging one danger after another and wreaking havoc on all. Shooting, blowing up, stabbing, and any number of ways of killing the ""bad"" guys.As with most video games, the man whose body the viewer is in has pistols that fire 20 rounds or more. And machine guns that fire unlimited rapid bursts. And physical ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound - sound familiar (hint - think krypton). The foreign makers of this film tried to incorporate something from many other ""psycho"" films. It has robotic bodies that are more mechanical than flesh. A woman scientist programs bodies she brings back from death and assorted parts. A crazed maniacal madman - I know, it seems doubly redundant, but Akan needs that to describe his character, who also has levitation and other strange sorcery powers.I'm sure that someone will call this ""art"" or creative for the imagination of combining all the mindless aspects. But, with all the mayhem, CGI, and constant motion and noise, one has to strain to find any acting, meaningful writing and dialog, direction, or even story. I could find nothing of any of those. It was difficult to sit through this mess to the end. And pointless, except to be able to honestly warn thinking people to avoid this ugly mess."
" Very Underated

" Quick question?
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,10,So Ummmmmmmmmmmm who played Henry? Just wondering needs this movie is amazingly awesome it's is a must see if u like that FPS look
" Load this into a bullet and pack it into my brain!
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,10,"Usually I'm not the one for an overly violent entertainment but this movie reveals a completely different side of such an experience. An incredible immersion factor that emerges from the unique style in which the movie was realized brought out the survival instinct within me in a torrent of completely unexpected and weirdly captivating emotion. If you happen to be an enthusiast of 'enhanced movie experience' this would be the next best pick right after the breathtaking 'Gravity'.
I see this movie as a 10 out of 10 experience for what it's advertised to be, just make sure you know what you're getting into before you proceed because you may not be prepared for what's coming for you if you go in blind."
" Don't Blink, Don't Think
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,8,"Just go along for the ride, because YOU are the Henry of the movie's title. Do things get confusing? Of course! THEY'RE MEANT TO. Is the violence sometimes too much for too long, getting a bit tiresome? IT'S MEANT TO. If you DON'T feel those things, then YOU are not playing the part of Henry... Which is what you're supposed to do."
" Don't compare with Tarantino
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,7,Excellent action flick dot the genre it sits in. Anyone who compares it to Tarantino obviously doesn't get Tarantino. Once you get over the first half hour of headache deducing mayhem this movie sets it's own standards. Definitely one for FPS fans.
" Best action movie I have ever seen until I see the 2
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,10,"Two reasons I can think of people give it below 9: one, they can't play FPS; two. they don't like action movie."
" Crank:High Voltage meets Brink
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,7,"So I just watched this movie and oh boy I think it is one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time and definitely the best since Mad Max: Fury road. This is a very unique movie and it feels very much like a live action adaptation of a first person shooting game. It looks quite good for an independent film and all the stunt work is quite breathtaking. The fact that its completely first person action movie and I didn't feel any motion sickness really says something about their fluid camerawork and editing. Also the music choices are great in it. It is self-aware of the silly plot and it adds to all the humor in it, which was a neat surprise. This movie is a high octane fast paced adrenaline pumping non-stop balls to the wall insanity and I freakin' loved it."
" Quite simply unwatchable!
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,1,"OK to the people out there saying that you should know what to expect from a first person shooter I SAW DOOM OK! I've played and watched other people play first person shooter video games!
Video Games don't utilise Shaky-Cam like this! This was ridiculous! This was so bad that watching this movie on Netflix I had to switch it off after just 30 minutes because my eyes were hurting and I was getting both a headache and dizzy!
When a person looks around at other people there is no jerkiness in real life! 
The shaky-came was EVERYWHERE! I can understand if the camera being on the body of the actor/stuntman when he's running/fighting shakes a bit BUT when he's just looking around at people who are talking to him like at the very start of the movie you've gone too far!
This movie was quite simply unwatchable and has the dubious distinction of being placed ahead of Jaws 4: The Revenge at #5 on my list of all time worst movies!"
" The best videogame nobody ever played!
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,8,"Hardcore Henry is frenetic from its first frame until its last. It is compelling for the sake of it's cinematography and coreography as well as the impossibly seamless editing. Is it a great film as far as the AFA is concerned? Of course not. Is it a great film as far as ""yerboi"" is concerned? Sure! This film took a concept and executed it so well, I am beside myself. Also, I am a little sour that I arrived to the party so late, which seems to be the common nature of films like ""Hardcore Henry"" . Great effort, great execution, great ridicule, greatly underappreciated. I hope that in the coming years, or, coming months, weeks I dare, this film will be seen for the achievement it is. The best ""Choose your own adventure"" book or videogame that no one has ever read or seen. It's all thought out for you, and is a much better adventure that anyone of the harsher critics of this film would ever have chosen. What do I know? Watch it and decide for yourself!"
" Great fun!
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,8,"Have you seen The Prodigy's music video for 'Smack my b*tch up'? And have you ever played a game like 'Doom' or 'Call of Duty'?
If you have, then you're going to find Hardcore Henry very familiar.I won't write a massive review here, but just to say the film is silly, funny, gory, cheesy, and overall a lot of fun!
If you are the sort of person who likes cheesy action films, then I reckon you're going to love Hardcore Henry. The special effects are really good, the story is far fetched but flows really well, and Sharlto Copley plays his character(s) really well.Grab a beer, sit in a comfy chair (not too close to the screen!) and enjoy.Some people may need some Neurofen afterwards though if you suffer motion sickness! :)"
" Extremely Dizzying
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,4,"The camera is the main character racing & running through the movie. After 45 minutes I had to turn it off, take 3 Ibuprofen & try to get to sleep with a severe case of vertigo. A good cinematic idea gone awry. It's like the main character/director are on a high dose of speed. Not my kind of movie...."
" Nothing wrong with it
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,10,"I downloaded this to watch on a car journey on holiday, with fairly low expectations. The film is entirely first person POV, and was marketed like a video game, and it delivers on that aspect. The problem with this would normally be that the fun part of video games isn't watching someone else play them. However, I was very surprised when I watched the film. In all films there is a part when you're bored or you wish people would hurry up and get on with it, not this one. The entire film is gripping from happily disorienting start to gloriously ludicrous end. The plot is fairly thin and most of the acting skills are non-existent, but if what you're looking for is a nonsensical hour and a half gore fest with camera work that makes Cloverfield look smooth, featuring a brief appearance from Tim Roth, I can't recommend this more"
" Just lovely
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,9,"Really enjoyed this movie. New and refreshing, clever and funny. Proof that a good idea and a dedicated cast beats out big Hollywood names and an unlimited budget every time."
" Respect for the action sequences and shots
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,9,"Think back to when you were a kid and saw your first blockbuster movie for the first time. For instance, for me, that was Harry Potter. Didn't you wonder how it was made, like how they made Harry fly on a broomstick or something? Yes, I am aware that this is a movie about Hardcore Henry and not Hardcore Harry, but my point is that as I grew up, my curiosity for the behind-the-scenes has slowly evaporated. However, with a budget of $2 million, Hardcore Henry's impressive array of complicated action sequences has once again perked my interest in the ""how they made it."" Because the movie was shot in first-person perspective, my intuition tells me that they were not able to use a lot of the standard cameras other high production movies use, and hence a lot of the scenes probably required some creative choreography and special effects rather than just computer animated visual effects (haven't done actual research on this, but this is just what my gut tells me). In addition, the movie also boasts solid acting, genuine laugh-out-loud moments, and a mostly coherent plot. For such a small budget, I am legitimately impressed that they managed to make such an entertaining movie, so this movie deserves my respect.9/10 with a few flaws, but a huge two thumbs up for the effort and creativity needed to shoot some of the scenes."
" Just loved it - FPS view was super idea
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,10,"As a woman nearing my 50s this was a total surprise to me as I picked it up without knowing anything about it and what a blast! I am a fan of FPS so right up my street. I must say I can't wait to see it again. 90 minutes of original, fun packed, shoot em action and gore to make you squirm and at points comedy that makes you laugh. The team involved in the whole film process deserve an applause, I love it when I watch a film that surprises me, I'm in awe of the GoPro concept and how well it was delivered. You have to give it a chance. For me it was like watching one of my skilled (of which I am not) gamer friends fly through a complex game level by level - absolute buzz to watch, such wonderful entertainment."
" The Game
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,10,"The visionary tedg asked many years ago:""Who will be the first to make a real game film? Who will try?""We are brought into Henry's world with no understanding of who we are, how we are situated or whom to trust. We have to learn along the way that we are embodied in the earnest 'motivated' hero, we are up against an evil scheming villain, and most importantly, up against increasingly challenging tests of physical prowess as we go along.The scheming and the exotic challenges enter the story: the evil boss is not just messing with the hero, but with -you- ,the viewer, as well. You are confused and have to fight your way to an understanding of what is going on and how you are situated. The movie ends with Henry / you finding a functional understanding of the world, literally chopped off at that moment.The style is based on the short ""Bad Motherf****r"". Some draw comparisons with 'Blair Witch' or ""Cloverfield', but those are only superficially similar because of use of the first person point of view. There, the narrative is objective and external. The closest forerunner to Henry's sort of internally contained narrative would be (the first, from the 80s) ""Robcop"" where you are transformed into the first person view when Murphy is reanimated and he/you have to figure what has happened. That section of the movie, too, was a very effective game that went over peoples' heads at the time.Now who will try to extend the concept to other genres?"
" BEST ACTION MOVIE ON EARTH!!
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,10,Screw who ever didn't give this a ten EPIC until the last second!!!! Holy crap did this movie get my heart bumping go Henry!!!! A MUST WATCH!!!!
" For action lovers!
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,10,In no way shape or form an oscar film or a great film but it does provide something new to audiences. It's not meant to be the best but it's meant just to be what the title says...'hardcore'.
" Non-Stop Action
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,10,My husband and I just finished watching this and we both enjoyed it immensely. We are life long avid gamers. Remember how much fun it was when you were a kid to sit with your friends and watch them play a game? That feeling when you got to join in on all the excitement but you didn't have to be bothered with any of the responsibility? That is Hardcore Henry. Big fun! 10/10 would recommend.
" It was a great action film!
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,6,"This film is the first to be shown in a first person, and it really helped to put yourself in henry place. Some motion were to quick, and did make me feel sick, but for an action film it does that. This movie is great if you just want to see gore, action, and comedy. I would recommend this movie, but their is a feeling that this would be a great game, I can imagine myself playing this. In the end it is still and enjoyable film."
" LSD TRIP

Special Effects? Also none stop. Basically, what you see on the screen cannot be turned off, and you cannot divert your eyes, mind, and ears! Forget the PAUSE button, you'll never use it.There are four main characters ... ""Nut Job, Jimmy"" ... ""the Star Cyborg"" ... The Wannabe Andy Warhol Nemesis"" ... and The High Tech Gorgeous Girl Friend."" The main confusion is how is it that Jimmy keeps getting killed, and coming back? And what is the reason for creating this Highly Technical Tripper?"" The movie is sort of like ""Rocky Horror Show"" yet it knocks that film out of the park, and off this planet! is this a great film? No! Because there is no such category to place it in. Watching this movie will change your life, for a week or two! By the way ... the rating should be CS-X ... Come Stoned Rated X! Or should that be Rated X Come Stoned?"
" Non stop fun

",2018-07-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie was amazing. The action, the music, the editing, everything about this movie was awesome. While the plot is eh at the beginning it makes up for everything at the end. Do yourself a favor and watch this amazing movie"

" Cult classic
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,8,"I was skeptical about ""Hardcore Henry"" when I realised it was a movie shot entirely from its titular character's perspective. Surely that would get old, I thought - as the same trick did with ""Maniac"".I was wrong. ""Hardcore Henry"" is an amazing feat of filmmaking wizardry. No one will put it up there with ""Russian Ark"", and perhaps that's not fair. I can imagine a lot of unflattering comparisons between it and video games instead, mainly from snootier film critics. I didn't mind the comparison. ""Hardcore Henry"" is kept afloat by its endless invention, extraordinary action set-pieces and tour-de-force performance from Sharlto Copley. It has a bodycount in the hundreds, and some scenes of violence that defy description.It's a true cult classic."

" It's like being in a video game
",2018-06-20 00:00:00,7,"This is what I image virtual reality will be like in 30 years. The movie did a great job with the pacing. It also followed the scripting a video game would follow. Introduce the audience to the character, give a short backstory that is enough to make the user feel invested in the character, then go straight into the action. All while slowly ramping up the intensity to see everything the character is capable of. Also the decision to not give the main character a voice made it easier to pretend it could be you doing all this.There were a few moments where the first person view got a little disorienting but I appreciated that the film often took breaks (usually comical) to give the audience a chance to catch their breath and lower their heart rate. Then it was right back into the action. I always wondered what it was like from the action stars point of view when shooting someone or getting shot. This did not disappoint. I highly suggest you go into this film WITHOUT reading what the plot is. There are enough twists in the movie to keep it entertaining and enough mystery to keep the audience involved. Mystery like ""Who is Jimmy and what are his motivations?"" and ""How is Henry capable of doing everything he is doing?""There were moments when Henry was in situations where I had no idea how he would get out of them and had to just sit back and see how it played out. Additionally it was easy to suspend disbelief since it's explained in the very beginning that Henry isn't a regular person. This was definitely an action ride that I would go on again. Gives a good adrenaline rush, with blood, gore, explosions, jokes and nudity. All the stuff that people watch action movies for."
" A nice idea, incredibly badly executed.
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,2,"Here we go with another writer/director movie. You know that doesn't bode well.It's essentially a movie of a first-person shoot 'em up. Many reviews complain of the shaky camera work, others defend it.The problem is, it's not true to life (as true to life as any camera shot can be), Quick proof. Nod your head. Do you look up then down as you nod? No, your eyes stay fixed in front of you, only your head moves.Of course, that's not simple to portray from a first person viewpoint but that's the director's problem, not the viewer's but is IS made the viewer's problem, because the shaky action is shaky camera action. When you're running around, your viewpoint changes rapidly but it's not disorientating as it is in the movie.Anyway...It's a nice idea very, very, very, very - sorry, sometimes there's just no other way to create emphasis than to repeat a word several times - very, very, very, badly executed.
 
A few minutes of this would be fine but a whole just doesn't work.The thing is, the plot as such would work just as well if told in normal cinematic terms (i.e. third or omni person viewpoint) so it's merely a gimmick and detracts from rather than adds to the movie.Interestingly, the highest IMDB rating came from the under 18s. So maybe as you get older you get more experience and become more discerning.You can't help but think the writer/director si trying to say what a clever writer/director I am rather than trying to tell a good story and make a good movie. Such is often the way with writer/directors.So, if it's on TV sometime, give it a try, you can always switch off or fast forward. If you're under 18 you may even like it...PS: This is not to suggest that under 18s have no discernment, of course they have. And if they love the movie - great! But as you get older and have more experiences with which to compare and contrast with other experiences, it's likely that your viewpoint will shift. You may still love the movie. On the other hand, you may see it for the gimmick it is. But in any event, your call..."
" FUN/TEN
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,10,"If you're looking for an in-depth plot and intense character development, then you're going to have to look elsewhere. This story is entertaining enough, but the best element is the action and incredible camerawork. There are a lot of interesting concepts and a decent story, but that isn't really the focus. This movie is very intense and entertaining, though you'll probably be bored if you don't like action. This movie is pretty funny has one of the most satisfying endings I think I've ever seen in a movie. I would definitely recommend this one."
" An interesting experiment that mostly pays off but does get tiring.
",2018-05-10 00:00:00,6,"'Hardcore Henry (2016)' is an interesting experiment, an action film told entirely from the first-person perspective. At times, it provides a unique kind of entertainment you won't find pretty much anywhere else. It's admirable what the team behind the picture were able to achieve with their limited budget and camera restrictions. Some of the already elaborate stunt work is made even more impressive when you realise that the performer(s) for the eponymous 'Henry' couldn't wear a safety wire due to the 360 degree view required for the camera to seamlessly navigate through the sequences. The video-game feel - which is bolstered by several clichÃ©s, such as a silent protagonist and 'tutorial' moments -can lead to some frustration as it just seems like you're watching someone else play when you'd rather take the controls yourself. The outlandish plot and mile-a-minute pacing, along with the constrained camera-view, do get tiresome quickly, too. As such, this as an interesting movie worth a watch once for its surface value, but not much more. Plus, it is likely to cause some motion-sickness if that's something you suffer from, and maybe even if its something you don't. 6/10"

" Random movie pick, thoroughly enjoyed.
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,8,"I could have done without the gratuitous nudity, but the movie mostly pushed beyond typical boundaries. A modernized Pulp Fiction - one wild ride after another.I never heard of this movie or 1st person view movies, just saw a reference to the movie somewhere down the rabbit hole of the internet this eve, so had no knowledge or expectations going into the moive. That was the best way to see this movie, maybe. I didn't get the effect of a vid game til about the hour mark, then it went full in on the game metaphor, with unrealistic kill ratios - ha. I actually had to check to see if this wasn't a real video game. I had played DOOM way way back now, the only game I ever played, not a gamer, so I had a good reference as to what the basis of the film was, after a while.
 
However, the movie never slowed down, achieved its mark in creating disorientation through the whole movie."

The film is almost all action from a first person point of view, i.e. like watching someone else play a video game...which I don't really enjoy. The film also suffers from the same ailments of a found footage production: jerky camera, bad angles, foot cam, hand cam, and occasional lap cam. This was wasted time and space as it proved to be not entertaining.On the plus side, there is plenty of action and a strip club. The film was difficult for me to watch as I didn't know what I was looking at half the time. Oh yes, a wicked twist.Guide: F-word and nudity."

The story is also quite intelligent. While not too deep and amusing with usual stereotypes, it is actually believable. What happens in the movie actually (and amazingly) has a good background!As I commented, the camera is brilliant. Everything is shot as a 1st person, and while unusual, DOOM generation respect and enjoy that. :-) This move actually feels like a good FPS, in which you do everything right, from start to end. (You might want to play DOOM 2016. if you liked this movie.) I grappled handrests of my chair while watching this. It is unbelievably intense, and while being extremely brutal, it is not disgusting like a horror movie.It is also not hard movie to watch."

Nothing else to really keep you there.Its shot very much like a computer game, so its like watching someone else playing or watching one of those dreary walk throughs on YouTube of a computer game that you don't really like.To keep the computer game facade it's complete with fast panning, chase scenes (both in the car and on foot), quietly listening to guys on the other sides of walls and fighting 'bosses' at different stages. Like the flamethrower boss, the mansion boss or the head honcho guy who has some crazy mind moving powers.As a gamer sometimes when you play a game you think it could be film. But this film proves that yeah it could be film, but it couldn't fill ninety minutes. Twenty minutes at a push."
" BAD in EVERY WAY
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,1,"First, these scam artists took money from thousands of people to finish this film with the promise of delivering it to us. They NEVER did. I finally caught the film on cable and wow did it truly suck. Beyond the 1st person technique which they didn't manage to pull off, despite having done it in their music video, they clearly have no idea how develop characters or any real plot. DON'T SEE THIS FILM!!!"
" If you are gamer or lover of different type of action movies then you will surely love it.
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,6,"Hardcore Henry (2015 movie) is totally different genre of cinema as first person view. There is no need for actor for this type of script. Camera man or Director is main actor of this flick. If you have ever played Counter-Strike (video game) then this movie look like extended version of Counter Strike e.g. Gun, Pistol, Riffle, Knife and bomb. Camera work is totally different and some time, it required fresh mind audience otherwise headache for sure.Script may be more robust as this is science fiction genre. Although i would appreciate writer and director Ilya Naishuller for taking so much risk and experiment. One person has impressed audience with his performance: Sharlto Copley as Jimmy. Danila Kozlovsky as Akan did justice with his role of villain. overall this movie is one time watch.Note: I had headache after watching this on my system."
" This Is The Worst Of The Worst Of The Worst
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,1,"Oh dear, and where should I even start on commenting on this one? What can I day? THere are no sane words to describe this awful, horrid, shameful pile of steaming feces. There is such a thing as a negative suffix -less in English. So, this Timur Bekmanbetov's piece of garbage deserves to collect all the possible adjectives - brainless, thoughtless, mindless, shameless, faceless, headless, soulless, everything-less. Seriously, all you have is a first-person sick dizzy shooter, absolutely Horrible performance of all actors, mindless brutality, idiotic dialogues, horrid script (technically, a total lack thereof), tepid dug of a moral and a shockingly poor effort to be on the level with the Western standards. My word of warn - never ever watch this bizarre, fetid pile of dubious junk. In a word - Worst. In two - Rating - Zero, of all points. In several - never even think to try and waste time watching it."
" A great movie if you enjoy lots of action and can handle the camera.
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,9,"One quick point I'd like to make. It's almost sickening seeing people go out of their way to create a new and ""first"" IMDb account just to review a movie. I'm sure you haven't spammed 100 other movies with the same kind of nonsense story... I'm sure THIS is the movie that caused you to create your obviously fake account.As for the movie, it has a lot of negative reviews. People complain about a lot of things, saying they got sick, acting was bad, or they walked out within 15 minutes, etc. etc...First off it isn't a bad movie at all, it's actually rather enjoyable and I found it didn't actually get worse as it went on like some movies, but actually picked up. It's a nonstop action movie shot in the first person and if you can't handle a shaky camera, why did you even go out of your way to watch this movie? Let alone review it.The acting was just fine for what it was, I have zero complaints there. I mean I actually thought it was pretty good, and I'm sure most people would agree. The movie certainly shouldn't cause someone to leave within the first 15 minutes. I don't understand that argument, even the worst movie I've ever seen I sat through most if not all the movie, it's kind of ridiculous to judge a 1.5+ hour film on the first 15 minutes in my opinion. I recommend watching this movie alone and with noise cancelling headphones, at least that's what I did. I just feel that having seen this in theatres with people constantly getting up or on their phones would have ruined the experience. This movie did a lot right and I can't think of anything particular bad about it, especially since there's no movie quite like it. The movie's soundtrack was also very well done, it is very good at setting the mood for each scene throughout the movie.Much goodness/10"
" Great fun
",2017-11-08 00:00:00,10,"This had my attention from start to finish. The twist is very predictable, but it's forgiven for the sheer volume of excitement. The first person angle gives a great view on some aspects that are normally overlooked on an action film. I will probably watch this again to try and capture what I might have missed in the first round!"
" Is this really what today's standards are?
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,4,"Please, if you still have any sense of what a movie is.... Please for  the Love of God, stay away from this piece of Cr@p.  I really tried, and i am still do not believe that people can call this  a movie.   I've been on IMDb since 2001. And i have never written a review.  This.... (VIDEO) Made me do it.

What is this  world coming too.   Is this what the todayÂ¨s standards are?   Sad.... Sad,,,, Sad,,,   WARNING THIS IS A YOUTUBE MOVIE.   DO NOT WATCH IT IN CINEMA.   The 4 out of 10 i gave it ... is a very fair.... if not ... too fair of  a Score."
" This is what the world need - More Lemonade action movies
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,10,"I enjoyed it start to finish, it's stupid fun, it's stupid, but in a good way, and anyone with an urge for a trill needs to take a peek. The movie has that action movie cheese and cheapness, but it didn't seem cheap at all, the budget, direction and effects are top notch! I can't recommend this movie enough."
" Manic Violent Action
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,3,"(Flash Review)I'll admit that I was intrigued to see how one could make a ""first person shooter"" video game into a movie. I read that it was shot from mainly GoPro video cameras too. Anyway, I knew this wasn't chasing Oscars so with my expectations set properly, I entered the jarring and wild ride. Credit where credit is due; they stuck with the POV angle (just seeing the man's arms) the whole movie aside from a couple brief flashbacks. There was more grizzly violence than I imagined; first time I've seen a windshield wiper blade used as an efficient stabbing device. Yet there was so much action and blood that I became desensitized to it as well as bored and I imagine the person writing the IMDb ""parent's guide"" had a lot of work to do. haha Describing the plot is challenging as the story was very scattered. But the movie starts off with 'you' waking up and a nurse assembling some mechanical limbs to your body. Then bad guys break in and take the nurse who it turns out is your wife. Dodging gunfire, you escape and decide you should save her. You are chased the whole movie and encounter some people who try to help you but can you trust them? The main bad guy appears to have some sort of super power. Who knows why; I didn't catch it. There is a lot of unique action and some really clever scenes. Just wish the story was a bit easier to follow or at least held my interest enough to truly care. Kudos on the approach but Arnold's classics still rules the comedic action world."
" I'ts awesome!
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,9,"The movie is a perfect FPS shooing game where you're just seat. You know you're win, you know the plot is not that complicated, you see the picture is awesome! And that's 90 mins of a pure joy. You just have your beer and relax. That's it. Just a perfect rainy day evening I had.My point is that the movie is a perfect sample of what you would expect form the action movie."
" It Worked...
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,9,"shooting a whole movie form a pov perspective is something that doesn't even work in theory.The Diving Bell and the Butterfly tried this and it didn't work at least for me.it was impossible to shoot the whole movie form pov and at the middle of it they start using other kinds of shots.so i wasn't really excited for this movie but to my disbelieve it worked really good.being an entertaining action movie and actually entertaining you as an audience member.the characters are completely goofy and over the top but believable enough that makes you accept them.the plot is really simple but like mad max it works for the visual fun and pleasure and the story throws twists and turns enough to keep you interested in the main characters.the movie works like a video game without the interaction which may make some people to prefer the video games.but if your'e that type of person that actually likes the cut aways in the video games and the plot of video games and isn't only interested in shooting anyone in the video games this movie is made for you.so buy the blu-ray,gather some friends and get entertained for a hour and half of your life."
" Gory First Person Shooter with a note of comedy and nudity
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,10,Excellent First Person Perspective movie with a lot of fast paced action and its fair share of comedy moments. Recommended for a mature and insensitive audience as the movie is filled with bloody gory goodness. Long story short it's pretty much Deadpool in First Person Perspective
" Adrenaline Sucker
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,6,"It is admittedly bold to make a film completely like a first-person-shooter. I remember the movie 'Gamer', which had large parts shot in this mode, and a remarkable scene in 'Kick-Ass' (2010) is alike.The complete absence of any depth of character or any depth of a story is a pity, but understandable in this experiment. The movie rarely takes a breath (if it even does), at least to explain something. Explanations are mostly done during chases, between reloading, or while fighting.So, if one is willing to follow 90 minutes of shooting, chasing, kicking, climbing and blood splattering in Russia, mostly Moscow, always at high speed / in nitro mode, this movie delivers. It also delivers some funny moments, and a comedic one-man-show by Sharlto Copley, who was the main reason for me to watch it.The shaky and sometimes pixelated camera is a point where some people may quit, aside from the ultra violence. I for myself got used to a shaky camera since 'Star Trek V', and the violence here looks merely synthetic than real.Which is the biggest criticism I have - the movie itself, yet filmed in the real world with real actors, feels synthetic. Well, that can be also my biggest compliment, take it as you want. The characters - if one dares to call the appearing persons so - are either too short-lived or too exaggerated to bond with one of them. But I understand that that may be intended.Technically, the movie is OK, it was shot on a GoPro Action Cam on Purpose, with all it's advantages and disadvantages. The shakiness may be one thing that game players do not experience, because they prepare themselves for every camera move, while they are navigating.A little guidance from producer Timor Bekmambetov maybe would have helped, to bring this movie out of it's niche, into our hearts, instead of being a pure Adrenaline sucker. I am a bit disappointed, because especially with a team that is mostly Russian, that should have been possible. At least, the humor is very Russian in large parts."
" Harcore Action, Fun, Enjoyment And Entertainment
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,7,"OK let's get straight to the heart of the matter. With Hardcore Henry you will neither get an in-depth story full of twists and turns nor will you get a very original story either. I mean let's face it....how many previous films already have the ""madman wanting to create a legion of killer cyborgs and hero needs to stop him"" tag?Rhetorical question of course because we all know that dozens is the answer.However - how many of them have as much non-stop relentless action, as much violence, as much tongue-in-cheek humour, and as many amazing visuals/fight sequences/stunt work/choreography as Hardcore Henry? Not many should be your answer there. Also, how many of them have been filmed completely from a person's first point-of-view? That's right. Hardcore Henry was filmed ENTIRELY from POV. Now, we've seen this countless Horror films like that, but in this genre? Not so much. At first you would probably think that it would be just a shaky mess with the POV from the amount of fast-paced action in the film but not so. You see plenty of what is going on even when the fight sequences become very full on, which is just as well really because it IS very full on and in-your-face within the first couple of minutes of the film starting.The filming of Hardcore Henry is extremely impressive and the way the makers have edited everything together to make a seamless movie is even more so, and not just with the fight scenes but the impressive visual effects as well (the 'song/dance routine by various characters played by Copley being just one).Speaking of which, Copley puts in amazing performances playing various characters throughout the film, from an English punk rocker to a WWI type of English General. With the performances this man puts in to his films it really should only be a matter of time before he picks up a major Award.Hardcore Henry is an excellent - and very original - movie and is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish."
" Don't think, just enjoy
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,7,"Henry who was dead once was resurrected and became cyborg by his wife and her mates, but after his 'boot', their facility was attacked by Russian psychic called Akan. Henry escaped with his wife but she was kidnapped by Akan so Henry and his cooperator Jimmy try to take her back.First, I want to say that the story of this film is not good, but I literally enjoyed this because most of footage and actions of this film made me high. Most of scenes were shot through the GoPro so audiences enjoy Henry's view like FPS games. The actions of this film go fast and those are strenuous and GoPro were used well so I enjoyed those unreal actions like through my eyes. Thus, I think this film is innovative compared with recent other movies. However, some people must feel sick so I strongly recommend you watch trailer before watching this.Like I wrote the story is not good so much but because of footage, I felt adrenaline and high. Therefore, you should watch this movie when you really want to feel satisfied without thinking difficult thing."
" Underrated origina 1st person COD film!
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,10,"I don't have time to denounce all the 1-6 star reviews but all I could say is WOW! Wish it was in theaters longer than 2 weeks or else I would've been able to see it. What an underrated film!!!! Viewers who have sticks up their butts don't realize that this form of a movie has never came to Cinema. It's underrated & brilliant. Hopefully there's another movie like this, or even a sequel :)"
" Barely a Guilty Pleasure
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,4,"Hardcore Henry follows a man turned cyborg as he attempts to rescue his wife from the men who kidnapped her. This is the first action movie to be filmed completely in first person. And some of the action is actually pretty fun. It's almost always exciting and moving, things are always blowing up and stuff. It's a good time, or at least it's trying to be. It's clear though that Hardcore Henry isn't supposed to be a serious movie. It's supposed to be a self-aware over-the-top action comedy, and a lot of that comedy works. Very often the humor is well-timed and laugh-out-loud funny. I really enjoyed those parts of the movie. Despite this, the movie is also too self-serious at times. There really isn't any part of this movie that should be serious, and yet it still tries from time to time. Yet the movie is so rushed that it simply can't develop anything, and as a result any grain of investment is ultimately lost. Furthermore, the movie is nauseating to watch. Like I said it's completely in first person. It's similar to a found footage movie, which is a style I am quite a big fan of. But here it just doesn't work because most of the time I can't tell what's going on, so it's honestly pretty boring. And when it's not boring I feel like I'm going to throw up. I'm pretty sure I actually had to look away a couple times in fear that I would puke. Also the special effects are just terrible. If you see the movie you'll know this for yourself. Overall Hardcore Henry is a nauseating, if not boring, if not very funny action film, but 9/10 times it's one of the first two. I really didn't enjoy this movie, and in the end I wouldn't recommend it at all."
" An action film desperately in need of a decent plot.
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,5,"Henry (Andrei Dementiev) wakes up without his memory but with a new set of bionic limbs, after which he finds himself hunted by telekinetic Akan (Danila Kozlovsky) and his numerous henchmen. Helping Henry to escape Akan's clutches are the multiple avatars of disabled genius Jimmy (Sharlto Copley).The first person point of view of Hardcore Henry is an undeniably skillful technological feat, the experience made all the more impressive thanks to the incredible derring-do of its lead character, who possesses some serious parkour skills (and nerves of steel), and the efforts of countless stunt guys, whose work is enhanced by some very convincing special effects.I'm guessing that writer/director Ilya Naishuller felt that his film's first person gimmick, unrelenting pace and jaw dropping stunts would be more than enough to keep his audience happy, because he certainly didn't try very hard with the story, with what little plot there is told in a muddled fashion that really isn't worth the effort to unravel. Without a decent narrative to tie all of the action scenes together, Hardcore Henry eventually proves rather wearisome, despite its escalating 'How the hell did they do that?' mayhem and ultra-violence.The format worked so much better in Naishuller's music video 'Biting Elbows: Bad Motherf***er', where a strong story wasn't a requirement."
" An Interesting Experiment in First-Person POV w/ Little Substance Behind It
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,6,"Remember that first-person action scene from DOOM in 2006? For that matter, does anyone remember DOOM? Anyway, there was the big sequence in the final act where the mediocre sci-fi action film decided to pay homage to the video game on which it was supposed to have been based where the camera assumes a first-person perspective where the audience sees through the eyes of the hero for a short killing spree. If you ever watched that scene in DOOM and thought to yourself ""Why not do the entire movie like that?"" then HARDCORE HENRY might just be for you. It's shot through the eyes of our silent protagonist Henry as he slaughters his way through ninety minutes of action. After an admittedly cool series of opening credits, we enter the film as Henry awakens in a laboratory with a beautiful scientist, who claims to be his wife Estelle (Haley Bennett), reassembling him with bionic limbs and explaining that there's been some sort of incident but, cool news, he's a cyborg now. Before he can have his voice unit activated (conveniently to allow the viewer to imagine themselves in the roleÂ…just like a video game), the lab is attacked by the film's main villain Akan (Danila Kozlovsky), a pale-skinned psychopath with the power of telekinesis. Akan wants Henry for his own personal army and takes Estelle as collateral until Henry submits; what follows is an extensive series of chases and beatdowns as Henry races to confront Akan and rescue his wife.The whole gimmick of telling an entire film from the first-person perspective is a challenging prospect, though I'm honestly surprised the popularity of first-person shooter video games hadn't brought one on sooner. Because the film wants to put you in Henry's shoes, he has no dialogue of his own and all exposition and story elements are introduced by supporting characters who proceed to explain the situation to our amnesiac hero as the movie goes forward. To put it simply, we learn everything we need to know through the movie in the cut scenes between battles. Most of it comes from Sharlto Copley as a scientist who carries a grudge against Akan and hopes to use our super-soldier to achieve his own vengeance. Copley is, as he seems to be in pretty much any movie he's in, one of the highlights. His character, Jimmy, comes in many forms. Having been crippled by Akan as punishment during the development of the super-soldier program, Jimmy utilizes a collection of personal clones (of varying colorful personalities) to handle his work in the field. I admit I thought it went a little over the top when his clones burst out into a song and dance number about halfway through the film, but I'll forgive it because Copley is just so charismatic. But seeing as how our hero has no memory of anything before awakening in the lab, we're left to wonder if Jimmy, or anyone, can be trusted until the final act where all's revealed.No spoilers but the big reveal and its accompanying explanation don't make a lot of sense to me. When Akan's big plan was revealed, I just sat bewildered wondering why he went through something so complex and wasteful that I'm sure could've been handled with a hundred or so less casualties. I thought it was pretty stupid but, then again, I'm pretty sure no one is watching HARDCORE HENRY for the plot. It's all about the brutal, bloody violence and theÂ…I dunnoÂ…wish fulfillment that comes from witnessing it through the hero's eyes. Again, like a video game. I can't stress enough that watching HARDCORE HENRY is like watching a friend play a video game for 95 minutes. Right down to the mission assignments coming through over the phone (""Get to X and acquire the Y!"") and the obligatory final boss battle. It's a real cool gimmick and the novelty didn't get old until about halfway through the movie when my attention started to wander. You can only get so much out of it. They ran the full gamut here: parkour, martial arts, loads of gunplay, vehicular combat, and graphic finishing moves. It's a fun movie to watch once, maybe twice if you want to introduce a friend to it. I have to imagine people with sensitive motion sickness might not take to it so well because the movie is nonstop shaky-cam, so keep that in mind. Otherwise, action nuts will find something to enjoy here and it's worth checking out for the unique style."
" One word, EPIC
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,10,"This has to be the most epic action movie I've ever watched with an insane plot twist. God damn, haven't watched a action movie like this ever. I was playing a game while watching this as I intended to play the game and watch a movie at once to not get bored, but it ended up with me forgetting about the game an watching the whole movie. Only complaint must be the cgi on the explosions but that's minor to affect the score. I give it a 10/10 + First person made things a lot cooler!"
" It's nonsense but very entertaining....
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,7,"Think of this as a filmed comic. There's no morality in the tale, no depth to the characters or story and you certainly won't learn anything from watching it but the special effects are excellent and its novel cinematography, with all screenshots from Henry's point-of-view, great fun."
" Eh...where has this film been all my life?
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,10,"I dunno. Im pretty fussy when it comes to whether or not I like a film. But this....Im stunned. It was fantastic. I cant wait til my son is of age so we can watch it together. An acquired taste possibly. If you want to escape into another world, be a hero, with awesome abilities fighting the good fight in complete mayhem..then this is for you. Might be a bit gruesome for some but I don't know how to battle your way through countless bad guys without cracking a few skulls."
" What a blast!
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,9,"I caught the tail end of this movie on cable TV and it hooked me. I finally recorded it and I wasn't disappointed. Yes it is gruesome at times but it is not like in other movies where the gore is the main part of the scene. Here it is satisfying because the bad guys get to suffer. I am usually squeamish and had to turn away at gory scenes in other movies but here it was great! Action packed, non-stop movement for the most part and the scenes are not as jittery as other FPV movies. I have gained much respect for Sharlto Copley who played all his parts extremely well. I am also impressed by the director and especially by the stunt actors. I have to get the DVD in order to see the making of the movie, deleted scenes, alternate endings, commentary, etc. I gave it a 9 only because the end leaves you hanging. It is suggestive of a sequel which I hope happens. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and recommend it for all except perhaps the very squeamish. If you're a guy, go see it! Women won't like it as much."
" Action Movie Done Right
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,8,"When I heard that this movie was entirely shot in POV I was immediately very excited to see it, when I saw it, it blew my mind.The movie starts pretty calmly only to quickly get us into the fast paced action for pretty much the rest of the movie, at the exception of a few exposition scenes that never fail to entertain us mostly due to the amazing performance(s) of Sharlto Copley in the role of the mysterious Jimmy who is hands down the most entertaining character of the entire movie.The action in this movie is violent,brutal and relentless. Thanks to the breathtaking parkour that only make the action scenes even better.The POV (aka first person view) is clearly an homage to FPS games, and it never gets old.But it's clearly not for people who suffer from motion sickness (obviously).Only some few points in the story aren't explained in great details, but it really doesn't take anything away from the movie.Hardcore Henry is a thrill from start to finish and a love letter to the FPS genre. It never take itself too seriously and is one of the main reasons why this movie is so much fun.For all those reasons, I'm not ashamed to say that Hardcore Henry is my favorite action movie of 2015!"
" Like nothing I've ever seen before
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Watching 'Hardcore Henry' is like playing a video game, only 10x more entertaining and without the frustration of dying repeatedly. This is exactly the sort of film you either love or hate, and I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.This is the only first-person action movie I think I've seen, in fact I'm not even aware if there are any others out there like this. It was a gamble, but as far as I'm concerned, it paid off. This is a highly enjoyable film and one I would happily watch again and again without getting bored of.This is a must watch for any gamer, but it's also a great action film that will satisfy a much wider audience. I would highly recommend it!"
" Probably the finest low budget action movie ever made.
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,10,"When your free from big production values, with big costs, you are free to create art and inspire awe. I have seen this work 4 times already, and not just because of its technical prowess, but for its sheer dark fun. The whole piece is an amazing experiment in film making and reminds me of the feelings invoked by Titans such as Reservoir Dogs and Man Bites Dog. Total respect for the makers, this must have been a mare to make."
" First person shooter for the entire movie, so it's just boring
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,3,I never watch trailers because it spoils half of the movie and I like to be surprised. But if I had seen the trailer of Hardcore Henry I would for sure not even started watching it. It's shot for 90% in first person perspective and that's something I just can't stand. The only time I can stand this is if I play a first person shooter on my game console. And even then I'm not a big fan. So watching an entire movie like that is really not my idea of a fun movie night. Add on that that the story is just weak and you just get a bad movie. There is almost nothing else to see then killing and shooting. The people that like this movie are probably FPS gaming addicts and I can get that but for me unless I can play it myself I do not enjoy watching somebody else play and certainly not for almost two hours. If it was up to me I would give up on that technique of shooting a movie because it simply doesn't do any good to a movie.
" Full-on fun but underdeveloped
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,7,"Hardcore Henry is truly a fun and full-on breathless movie that will delight both action-movie lovers and video-gamers. This film is like a role-playing video-game. The main features of those games are that the player controls the hero character's actions and movements, the player sees through the main character's eyes, the character has a dangerous mission to carry out, the enemies are violent and have to be avoided and/or fought with more violence, and the mission is carried out in a hostile semi-desolated militarized world. In this film, we 'are' Harry and we see what is happening through his eyes, as if Harry's eyes were ours.The movie is action-packed, very violent and gory at times, raunchy and cheeky, but all of that is counterbalanced by a great dose of humour and hilarious moments that light the overall tone of the film. Besides, the movie doesn't take itself seriously, so it is one of those films that you enjoy fully present with a giant bag of pop-corn on your lap. The film production is very good and, as you can expect, action scenes are excellent. One of the trademarks of this film is the predominance of red and dark-gray colors, something that reflects the tone of the story; however, also here, those are balanced and toned down by some of the green exterior scenes. Tim Roth, in his tiny role as Henry's father; Danila Kozlovsky, as the evil powerful Akan and, above all, Sharlto Copley as the multiple Jimmy, are great in their roles. Although the film is very entertaining and fun, it is also underdeveloped. It lacks something that is very important to good video-games: the introductory presentation. In this intro, the player is offered a mini-short with the background: who the characters are, especially the leading hero; why they are there, what lead to the start of the game, the nature and aim of the mission, and so on. This provides a narrative framework that makes the experience more enjoyable. Unfortunately, this film does not have that sort of intro, not bothers to present viewers with any sort of complexity, so the plot is weak and insubstantial and the characters hollow. And those are the main flaws of the film."
" Simple outstanding
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,10,"The movie is made in a way that you believe that you are part of it, yourself feel it part of your own, and maybe you will even jump when Henry does it.I had a lot of fun watching this movie, has been a while since I didn't feel this way."
" FPS+Movie= Amazing
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,10,"Wow, I wasn't expecting this AT ALL but, this movie has the BEST action I've seen in a long time. I saw the reviews on IMDb and wasn't impressed. THank you to the people who rated it well. THIS MOVIE IS SO MUCH FUN TO WATCH! It's funny too which I wasn't expecting at all! I don't want to say anything else and I have a final statement. Watch this movie.0/10 I got motion sickness."
" Hardcore Henry is to Action, as Porn is to Making Love
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,8,"I think I saw a short for this film when they were crowd-funding. Despite being highly attracted to the excessive violence, I remember thinking it would be hard to watch a full movie in First Person perspective.Even though the camera was stabilized, it was still a little too jiggly for comfortable viewing at times. The wife had enough of it after about 30 minutes, but even she couldn't look away. The action is non-stop and just doesn't give you time to take a breath as the next mind-blowing stunt explodes on screen.As a gamer, I enjoyed the whole film, which could become a 'how-to' instructional video for stuntmen. I was very impressed with the level of violence, tight script pacing, clever and seamless scene transitions, gratuitous nudity and the injected comedy was spot on.As it is a very unusual film in style, I think audience opinions are going to be split down the middle. You'll either love or hate it.I'm giving it the love. See Hardcore Henry with some mates and have a few beers."
" Great effort - Well done
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"Very well done first-person action shooter movie with obvious inspiration taken from the video game industry. That said, the movie ties together quite nicely and one is kept guessing until very close to the end. I suppose it could have been even MORE over the top, and this isn't what I'd call an ""ultraviolent"" movie like the ""John Wick"" series is - The violence in ""Harcore Henry"" isn't generally gratuitous in that you're not seeing a bunch of 'innocent' people being killed or harmed for no reason. When so-called civilians, such as the woman on the escalator (as seen in the trailer), are hurt, it's actually kind of funny. But without going too far down the rabbit hole, this is not a film for everybody. It's pretty easy to guess, based on the various reviews and descriptions available here and elsewhere, whether this is the type of movie one would like. So the negative reviews are somewhat misplaced - the film is NOT TRYING to please everybody. Not even close. And what they DID do was done VERY WELL. Great soundtrack too. Get yourself a decently large TV, turn up the subwoofer and have fun."
" Non stop thrill ride!
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Can only agree with other reviewers asking what the negative folk expected.... this was an original concept sticking to the first person view throughout rather than a random section like Doom. Don't get me wrong I almost gave up after the first 5 minutes thinking I would never get used to it and the wife was concerned it would just make her sick. Thankfully after the initial chaos is does settle down for a bit allowing you to adjust for the rest of the film, which barely lets up.From a film-making perspective its a great achievement, huge credit to the folks doing all this with a go pro attached to your face! The reviews saying there is no story have a fair point, I would say its not so much no story as a fairly simple yet convoluted in places one. At least it tried to have one in place that wasn't too generic. The main focus is the action and in this area the film really delivers, combine that with an excellent soundtrack and this one is a winner. Recent years we have been blessed with films being made by the stuntmen like this and John Wick, and to an extent The Raid & Dredd. With all the superhero and bloated blockbusters we have its refreshing to not only get an excellent action film but at least one who brought some originality in their delivery, and as such they should be supported so we get more.Must see for action fans."
" Loved it, loved it, loved it.
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,10,"Despite other people having said that this was not the first that they have seen filmed in the first person, this was the first that I have seen. I was not expecting what I was in for. This film was exactly what it said on the tin. I loved it from the first moment. The film does not pertain to be a serious reflection of the human character or a deep study of the possibilities of science in the future but it was a knee trembling, gun totin', self a facing, comedy from the off. It is a film that you can have fun with. It laughs at itself along with you. It is one of those films that you can switch off from your day and sit in front of and by the end of it you will feel better about yourself because you have had a good laugh. I have watched it several times now and feel the same whenever I have seen it. I know that I will watch it again, and I will feel the same no matter how many times I do. It has been added to my favorites."
" Must to see
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,10,"This film was made by just a go-pro cam with low budget, but it is funny all the way with very good plot for such kind of films. good parody on all 3D shooters and rembo-style Hollywood films in one. yep, actioncam video sometime hard to see, but it brings you inside the movie, making you the perfect player in this FPS-film-game)"
" Why not in 7 stars?
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,9,"This is very underrated film. Problem is there was nothing like that before, so many people can not identify it with anything. And i think another factor is origins of this movie. Well, it is not Hollywood. It is Russian Director and mostly Russian team. Why would they promote or rate competition? I can bet Hollywood will make some exact but still sickening remake in couple of years. Like with: Let the right one in, The Ring, Oldboy, And many more. They simply have to repeat grate movies bit more slowly for someone. Luckily, not for me. But Hardcore Henry Rollacosta Ride will be one of my favorite Action films for years to come. Please more Ilya Naishuller. Don't stop there."
" Absolutely amazing...
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,10,I personally found this movie to be one of my new favorites. The simple fact that they were able to put together an action movie like this in first person view is honestly perfect to me. Some people have different views on what they expect a movie to be like and I'm very open to new things like this when it comes to movies. I enjoyed this movie greatly and would love to see something evolve from it (like what happens after the end of this one). So to those of you that gave bad reviews obviously the movie wasn't for you and wasn't what you expected it to be but you have to be open minded to these things. I gave this movie a 10/10 rating because it kept my interest through the entire thing and cant wait to see if anything else comes of it!
" Unwatchable. Perhaps the worst movie I've yet seen
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,1,"It takes a very special kind of movie to warrant a zero star rating: one that lacks any semblance of artistic endeavor or passion. Hardcore Henry is that movie, and assuredly one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. The plot is laughable, the characters undefined, the visual look of the film something The Blair Witch Project would have turned down for being too confusing.The film itself is borderline unwatchable due to it's first-person camera technique, putting you in the viewpoint of Henry, a man who may or may not be the most boring cinematic character to ever roam the silver screen (despite blowing up people's heads like most people might pop a roll of bubble wrap). The shakiness is to the point where I found myself completely lost in a blur attempting to discern who is fighting who and what exactly the purpose of my life to this point has been. The gunfighting, bloody as can be, was tedious and beyond all levels of taste.Strapping a camera to the face of a stuntman who clearly has no idea how to film a movie, I found myself bored to the point of wandering out to the theater's bathroom (an AMC chain in downtown Chicago). I was surprised to discover a fully remodeled washroom with a warm, inviting glow and beautiful wood detailing on the bathroom stalls. The bathroom was unoccupied aside from me (most peope don't go to the movies at 1:45pm on a Thursday), so I had time to enjoy the quiet and hum to myself quietly while doing my business. Even the faucet was full of amazing detail and practicality. After using the soap dispenser, I realized the sink itself had a hand dryer installed directly beneath the flow of water. It was quite literally one-stop-shopping for my hand washing. No more dripping hands while I clumsily attempt to walk across the bathroom to some paper towels. Genius.What was I talking about again? Oh yeah, the movie sucks."
" Fun to watch!
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,9,"If you like action movies and are tired of the same old stuff released year after year - this is a great movie to see. The story might seem a bit complex and messy at times with some plot holes here and there, but it doesn't take away from what this movie is supposed to be - just simple fun.The movie is shot entirely from first person perspective. It's not the first time it's been done (Cloverfield had the same approach), but the action sequences are what makes this movie exciting and extremely unique. This movie wasn't supposed to be taken seriously and maybe for some it might look more like a technical (from cinematography perspective) exercise, but I think experiments like this are important to keep the whole industry moving forward.Would want to see another one like that for sure."
" Probably the greatest film ever
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Yes, it's true, when historians look back at the finest works of art ever committed to celluloid, 'Hardcore Henry' will trump Citizen Cane, Empire Strikes Back and the Godfather. Just kidding. However, just because it won't sweep the Oscars doesn't mean that it's not a blast.First of all, before you decide whether or not to see it, let me ask you a questionÂ… do you know what an 'FPS' is? If the answer is 'no' then you probably won't agree with my â€“ slightly flippant â€“ opening comment about 'Hardcore Henry' being the greatest film ever. If you do know that 'FPS' is a computer-gaming term referring to 'first person shooters' then you'll probably be aware that the entire film is shot through the eyes of the titular 'Henry' â€“ a genetically-enhanced human who has the skills (and firepower) to shoot, blast and kick his way through hordes of faceless enemy goons (oh, and one telekinetic 'end-of-level' boss).Basically, this 'film' (and I put 'film' deliberately in quotes) plays out like one long computer game (or 'FPS' I should say). It has minimal story and character development, simply moving from one breath-taking set-piece to the next. So, if you're looking for deep and meaningful story-telling, then best you look somewhere else. This plays out like one long music video, relaying on special effects and awesome stunts to wow the audience â€“ as long as you're aware of this (and possibly have a healthy appreciation for the FPS genre) then you should be entertained. Oh, and just because Henry stays mute throughout the whole film, doesn't mean that there isn't some pretty snappy and hilarious dialogue courtesy of the (ever reliable) Sharlto Copely.And 'entertained' is the word. This film's selling points is its stunts, not its story. And it is a landmark achievement in film-making, if not storytelling. It really is well-done when you consider that it's trying to tell a story using a silent main character and shot entirely from his point of view. Basically, 'Hardcore Henry' isn't Shakespeare, it's just good, daft, action-packed fun. And, if you're aware of this, you should enjoy its pure over-the-top silliness, shooting and stunts."
" FPS (First Person Shooter) in movie format
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,3,"Filmed for its entire duration on a first person point of view, its loaded with frenetic action (running, parkour, fighting, shoot outs, loads of guns, etc...) almost restlessly, but lacks character development.It flows just like a video game, but even video games have better stories.The idea is original, but the constant camera point of view with so many jumps and bumps and shakes and movement becomes sickening really fast. I had to watch it in 3 parts during 3 days to not feel dizzy. That camera work needed to be more smooth.Therefore, I can not give it more than 3/10."
" Stimulating Experiment of Audaciousness and Execution that Blows the Mind
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"Does this Experimental Film Deserve the Buzz it has Received? Yes. It is an Accomplished, Artsy, Maniacal, Audacious Style of First Person Video Games, with a Hyper-Kinetic Mindset Fueled by, take Your Pick, Amphetamines, Adrenalin, or maybe Boredom.Whatever the Inspiration was for the Producer and Director the Result is a Remarkable Achievement. While the Execution is Mind-Blowing, the On-Screen Display is Breathtakingly Real, and the Experience is Exuberance Personified, it is Not Without Precedence. The Aforementioned FPS Video Games is Obvious. The Film-Noir ""Lady in the Lake"" (1947) was the Original POV Movie (a movie poster is shown quickly as a homage). Then there is ""Crank"" (2006) and a few other Films that Toyed with the Idea. So, the Concept has been a part of the Pop-Culture for many Years.There is No Denying that HH employs the Conceit and Runs, no Sprints, with its Over the Top take and sets the Bar so High it's going to be Difficult to make another that Succeeds as much as this Commendable Cinematic Work. No Doubt that it took a Lot of Work to make this Work as well as it does. It's at times Beautiful to Watch.But one Wonders where the Experiment will Lead. It's Limitations are Apparent from the Get-Go, because it seems to Wear Out its Welcome after about an Hour. So the Claims of a ""New Genre"" are Suspect.Those Prone to Motion Sickness should not Attempt this Shaky, Wobbly, Woosh of Camera Movement Technique because it is Non-Stop, Relentless, and the Frame is Never Still. Those that Enjoy that Sort of Thing (think of a camera strapped to your head while riding a roller-Coaster) and You Get what You're in for.Note...Actor Sharlto Copley should be mentioned as the most ""Human"" inclusion, and in multiple roles adds the humor and His is a demanding performance in the picture. He delivers and then some."
" Thin plot and bad characters, but entertaining nonetheless, due good stunt work and action scenes!
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"""Hardcore Henry"" is about Henry, who's resurrected from his dead, and modified with some robotic parts. He wakes up without memory and with one goal: save his wife.The film was directed by Ilya Naishuller and he did a fine job. He used a technique that hasn't been used before, or at least not to this extent, and that technique is filming the movie totally from the perspective of the protagonist. There are objective shots: everything is viewed from the eyes of the main character. This technique didn't really speak to me at first, because before watching the movie, I was anticipating it to be nauseating and hard to follow. I was correct on one of those two things: it was indeed hard to follow. Henry's head moves from one place to another very quickly numerous times in the film, by which you don't really know what's going on. Another thing I want to say about this technique is that it gets boring after a while. It's always the same perspective, and that gets repetitive. Ilya Naishuller was nonetheless able to create some good action scenes, over the top at times, but entertaining and cool to watch. The editing also made the movie hard to follow. I found the editing to be one of the worst parts of the film. There was an overuse of jump cuts, that really didn't fit and when they tried to hide edits, by shadows or him moving quickly or something, it always was noticeable. The soundtrack was unfitting, but some of the songs were good, just didn't fit the moment or the theme the film had set up, which is a shame. Sometimes the instrumental songs helped to create a tense scene, but these instrumental songs where almost every time the same song. This didn't really bother me, because the song did what it was supposed to do. At times they tried to use these tense songs in scenes to create a comedic effect, like when Henry is seen changing clothes in a small shop. That really didn't work for me, which was the case with most of the jokes. The stunt work I found to be very good. There were some impressive stunts pulled of, which were very entertaining to watch. A thing that I really disliked about the film was the sound design. It was lazy and repetitive; often you could hear the exact same sound a couple of times in a row. The acting was good. I can't really say anything about the acting of the actor of Henry, because we don't see his face, and only his body. So I'll start with Sharlto Copley. He had the chance to shine, because of the opportunities given by his character. Normally Copley is a good actor and this time he proves this once again. I very much liked his diverse range of acting capabilities. The actress who played Henry's wife, wasn't really that convincing to me. She couldn't really act and often just looked emotionless, which, of course, isn't a good thing. She was played by Haley Bennett, who has yet to amaze me by her performances. This one didn't really do the job. Danila Kozlovsky played the villain of the film. He gave an OK, clichÃ©d performance, but it was good enough for what the movie was asking him to be.The writing was just fine, nothing spectacular. The plot was pretty thin and seen before, but the first person aspect gives a twist to the whole thing. The characters were badly developed. They actually weren't developed at all, except for Copley's character, whereby he was the most likable of the few characters we see. His character was also the funniest of the all and managed to give me a few chuckles, but only his jokes were the ones that managed that. There were a lot of times the film tried to be comedic, but just failed at it. Due to the lack of characterization, I didn't feel anything for the characters and wasn't rooting for the main character. The villain is also your generic villain you see in every film. He didn't have any good motivation and he just felt flat. I didn't have any reason to hate him, nor like him. He was just there doing bad things, and that's the only thing that they give him. The film also tries to be like a first-person shooter, which I get, because of the whole first person aspect of the movie, but this wasn't transferred well into the script. Some lines felt like they could've been ripped right out of the tutorial of a shooting game, but this just didn't fit in those moments in the film. Copley is the one who's continuously telling Henry what he has got to do next, which is just very lazy storytelling. The twist at the end is something that I didn't really see coming, which sort of made up for some of the mistakes of the film. But that twist has also been done a lot of other times in a lot of movies, in which they handled it better and in which there was a better climax. In this film the climax seemed to go on forever. In the beginning it was cool and all, but after a while I just wanted it to end already, because the payoff didn't really pay off.In the end ""Hardcore ""Henry"", was an OK, disposable action flick, which brings an interesting, new technique to the table, that didn't really work out very well. The characters were badly written and developed, with the exception of Copley. His character was the most diverse and fun to watch. 5.4/10"
" Pointless Gorefest
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,4,"I didn't expect a whole lot going into this movie. At first it seemed quite innovative with the first person view and right up until the last 1/4 of the movie I would have considered it a fairly high octane very violent mindless action to pass the time. The last 1/4 or so, however, turned the knobs on the mindlessness and gore to a new level which completely ruined the whole movie.It seems like the main point of this endeavour was to show off as much violence without any real effort put into the story. The main villain is poorly established - the whole universe for that matter. We don't learn anything about the world worth mentioning. This movie cannot be spoiled - there is nothing going on. If, instead of focusing on the excruciating gratuitous violence and gore, the creators focused on the story this could have been a lot better film.Whoever gave this 9-10 stars needs to be locked up in a mental institution."
" One of the best action movies I've seen, just hear me out...
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"Hardcore Henry is about a guy who has undergone surgery due to multiple injuries, turning him into a ""cyborg"". I won't reveal too much of the plot, because it's one of those films you just need to see for yourself. In saying that, if you plan on watching this movie, go in with a open mind! I think that stands for all movies, but this one especially.Does it have deep rich storytelling? No. Does it have an amazing script, pushing films like The Godfather into the water? No. Is it fun? Yes. That's all this film needed to be, and what it wanted to achieve. One thing I have taken away from this film is the appreciation for the crew who worked on it. I have a lot of respect for the stuntmen who worked on this film. Every stunt in this film genuinely impressed me, unlike other films where you're just not worried about anyone getting hurt at all, it's almost as if you felt the impact of every hit, knife and gunshot. All thanks to the first person method they went with. Even though I think this film still could've worked without it, it wouldn't of had the same impact.I was pleasantly surprised by this film, and hope more people give it the chance it deserves."
" Exciting
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"A lot of people who don't understand the movie too well take it in as a wannabe action movie; you shouldn't take this movie to seriously. It's a crazy blend of Video Games, and Action movie tropes. I am not using this as a shield to defend it. But it's awesome if you want a fun movie that you can enjoy if you love these sort of movies. Every action sequence feels so good and just plain right! And it pokes fun of many different tropes. From the Villain to the characters. I like the vision behind it. If you're looking for more story and less intense movies, I would avoid this, but if you're looking for a fun experience with a couple of friends Like I was. This movie is entertainment gold. And too all the extremely negative reviews what else were you expecting. there were tons of trailers leading up to this movie."
" Worst movie that I have seen in 2016
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,1,"This film tells the story of a man who is resurrected from the dead by technology. There is a lot of buzz around 'Hardcore Henry' being the first film to be filmed in a first person perspective. To me, the film looks more like a video game, and I don't like video games. The contrast between Hardcore Henry and Frantz, the best movie that I have seen in 2016, is very big. Frantz is a quiet movie with a nice story line and Hardcore Henry was a complete waste of my time and money. Magallanes was on the second place of my list an An on the third place. I never will go to such a movie as Hardcore Henry again, it was just awful. And I felt already sick of dizziness after 10 minutes. It is the first time that I give just one star to a movie. The Shallows, another very bad movie that I have seen in 2016, got two stars of me."
