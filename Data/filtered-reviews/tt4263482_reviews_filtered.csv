" Very good movie
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie is just what i want, and i had a great time watching it."
" Creepy and Vague
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,7,I really appreciate the idea of this movie. It wants to make a horror movie that is slow and creepy with vague illusions to things without having to hammer them home to the audience.On the flip side of that it can be too slow. Sometimes it feels like there is too much dead air in between the plot. It doesn't really work to build tension it just shows them preforming normal tasks.It's a marvel to look at and really has a amazing fee while watching it. It's creepy and weird.It does sort of get a little tangled up in its self by the end and becomes a little bit isolating because it is known back and forward by the writer but the audience doesn't have that privilege which is why I think it would benefit from more than one watch.
" wouldst thow speaketh up
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,3,"Firstly you can't understand 90% of the words spoken. This really hinders the enjoyment as you're adjusting the volume up and down like a seesaw. The sound effects are at a 10 volume and the dialog is at a 5 for most of the time. Add to this the old English speaky speak and you have no idea what is being said. Things progress at a snails pace and in the very final scene when it looks like there is finally some action they roll the credits. It's less a horror and more an uneasy movie. The real horror is how puritanical they are and the absurd nature of their thinking. Rating out of 10 starts is hard. On the one hand you can see they really made it how they wanted and did it well. On the other hand as a piece of entertainment it's a bit like watching lawn bowls. It's got to be at least a 3 or 4, maybe a 5 or 6 depending on your view. It's certainly not a 10 and this talk of it being ""the quintessential 21st century horror movie"" is just laughable. Stuff it, to me it's a 3 at most."
" Worst Puritans Evaaaarrr!
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,9,"I found this to be pretty good overall, and totally rewatchable over time, especially because that helped make more sense of some of the darker, more ominous visuals (there were things I missed on the first watch), and to develop more empathy for the main character. Understanding the dialogue was not really a problem, IMO - it's not Shakespearean or anything. (Interpreting their twisted, tainted, opinionated logic was another thing.)The acting is very good. The family dynamics can be a challenging watch at times, but the idea that they're very different from any era should be dismissed. And, they're all sinners - Every One of Them, From Birth! Hahaha.Also, if they're gonna call you a sinner without actual facts, and banish or kill you for nothing, you might as well float off (naked?) to become a VVitch after the devil gets rid of them all for you."
" Not for horror fans, for arthouse indie peeps
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,9,"Excellent. Very slowly yet effectively conveys sexual politics or ""the witch"" era. Acting is excellent, direction as well. Really only for psycho drama fans, not horror. I loved it. Bonus points for Black Phillip, he is a true national treasure and should have received an Oscar for Best Supporting Goat in a Dramatic Role."
" Unsatisfactory Stories
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,6,"In the introduction of the film, we see that the father, the leader of the family, was expelled from the church on the grounds that he went astray from the path of God. Later, this family tries to survive by establishing a farm away from everyone. The first break in the story takes place here. Sam, the youngest son, is together with his older sister, Thomasin, in the clearing near the forest, while Sam suddenly disappears and is later killed by a witch.Caleb then gets lost in the forest and reaches the witch's house. The biggest witch here is given a very short space. The events that took place up to Caleb's arrival is another point where the story is interrupted. In this part, what the witch did to Caleb is completely enigmatic.We can understand the foundations of the story with William praying to god before he died. But we can't see any scene from the starting point of this. I was hoping for this part to be covered in more detail.In terms of camera and lighting, lighting and shooting angles were used one click above average. My biggest complaint in general of dark-themed horror movies is the darker scenes than they should be. So we need to see it to feel fear and tension. In some movies we just look at a dark screen and the main element that makes us fear or tense is the music. Not like that in this movie. Therefore, 8/10 points would be sufficient for the technical part of this film."
" Outstandingly BORING
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,1,"What a waste of time .
As if the language depicted of the 17th century wasn't enough to irritate the s**t out of us in expectation of some horror which happened and passed without even showing a clear image , the title Witch is a mere attraction to lure people like us , should have read folktale first ...
Please give it a miss"
" That's no horror movie, honestly.
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,3,"It's just a story of a family haunted by a witch! Movie scenes were so incoherently captured. Only the background music was up to the mark. You can watch it but don't anything! THAT'S NO HORROR MOVIE. Also keep in mind, this is a movie with a plodding storyline"
" Good period horror drama
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,8,"For an hour and a half it is a great watch. Acting is good, cinematography is good, plot is good, sets are good, speach is good. This movie is just a good movie.It is a bit slower than I expected and darker, but I actually enjoyed slower pace as I always expected something and that kept me on my toes.Definitely a movie for you if you like witches, past time, paganism, folklore, Satanism and similar topics."
" A masterstroke of horror, and cinema at large
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,10,"We've seen many movies before about unseen terrors and mounting ill omens befalling a family. But not like this.We can talk about the blood and gore. We can talk about the obvious supernatural elements that go beyond reality as it's known in-universe. We can talk about the dark, depressive, disturbing atmosphere, suspense, and mystery that only deepens and grows as the film progresses. We can talk about the acutely shocking moments, presented in a deliberately understated way, that in other pictures would get all the focus of the camera.These are all reasons why 'The witch' is horror, but still only scratch the surface of what makes it so gripping, and such an essential film to watch.'The witch' fully embraces and embodies tropes of horror that most movies can only claim to dabble in: accusations of witchcraft, creepy behavior from children, hallucinations belying more horrid circumstances, exposure to Satanist worship, and more. Many movies play in this space, and surely do it well, but none immediately come to mind that actualize these ideas of the horror genre so concretely.Even still - the narrative is truly only part of the appeal here. A great deal of labor and love went into crafting a picture as period-accurate as it could be. From the meticulous construction of the family's domicile to the weave of their clothing, from the purposeful isolation of the setting to the lighting in each scene - writer and director Robert Eggers is to be applauded for overseeing a production so heavily detailed, to the extent that I again find myself unable to name an immediate comparison. A rarity in the horror genre, above all.Furthermore - it's one thing to hold a casting call in England to bolster authenticity, but the accents and manner of speaking of the early 17th century are a far cry from speech readily recognizable almost 400 years later. There's no shame in turning on subtitles here, as devotion to historical accuracy extends so completely to even the script that the dialogue can sometimes be difficult to discern without them. The cast is outstanding as they bring this tale to life, with even the grammar of another era playing heavily into their roles. All perform admirably, but very special mention must be made of Ralph Ineson, portraying the deeply religious and stubborn father William - and Anya Taylor-Joy, in the part of the bewildered, put-upon teenage protagonist, Thomasin. 'The witch' marked only the film debut of Taylor-Joy, and one would hope that she has many great things coming to her, because she is phenomenal.There's something to be said for the way these characters are presented to us. We readily sympathize with Thomasin, a young girl who is trying to define herself while suffering the scorn of her parents in the circumstances they find themselves in. We sympathize less immediately with the twins that torment their older sister, or with the strict father whose stubbornness and religious devotion upholds an imposing moral view that would essentially demand the damnation of anyone watching the film. Yet even as we identify most with Thomasin, as events escalate and tragedy and hardship befall the family, it's difficult not to still feel crestfallen with each portent they suffer.All of this only makes the ending even more tremendous. The conclusion of 'The witch' is hands down one of my favorite endings to any movie I've seen, matched only by John Carpenter's 'The thing' (though there are many runners-up). The way the ending conveys its atmosphere, the way it toys with the suspense that's been building, and the very denouement of the narrative all mesh into a genuinely perfect capstone for such an incredible film.'The witch' isn't for everyone, not by a longshot. Between the blood and gore, general violence, nudity, and overall themes, someone who doesn't enjoy horror films isn't likely to find favor here, either. Yet the movie is so very carefully, lovingly made, in every possible way, whether one is dissecting the production, the screenplay, the acting, or the narrative generally. Despite belonging squarely in the horror genre, the content here is so well crafted that I feel obligated to recommend 'The witch' to all possible viewers.There are so very few horror films that are this compelling.Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?Why, yes. Yes, I surely would."
" Come hither
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,5,"Very difficult to understand and honestly not very interesting.. I realize people have different tastes, but I'm Surprised anybody would think this was a masterpiece! Good ideas put out there, but they never actually spark."
" - It's good, it's suspense and drama as well as terror.
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,7,"It is not a film that scares the public, it is a history film that makes everyone uncomfortable. The film is almost a complete horror, but it is the discomfort it leaves in the air that sums up the film. The silence and the soundtrack bring a certain tension to the film in the midst of such discomfort, in addition to the cuts ending it with a flourish.
The tension and the gloom was what caught my attention the most, even though the discomfort stands out among them because it was added in exaggerated doses. I was also open-mouthed with the performance of the actors, especially with the performance of the younger actors, it is surprising to see this in young people, there is not much of it these days.
I thought the proposal for the image of a witch that was delivered to us and sorcery was incredible, even though we saw little of it during the film, this image proposal is good and at the same time it is traditional and versatile in the director's way, in addition to being obscure , that most of the time the directors look for obscurity and only deliver clichés, something superficial and the opposite of what is really obscure. In short, it is a good film among other good ones, but not as spectacular as a few. It is not a typical terror, it is not what is expected of a terror, but we can call it terror as we can call suspense and family drama as well."
" Don't waste your time
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,1,I don't know what I was expecting but this is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. Don't waste an hour and a half of your life
" THE OMINOUS MALEVOLENT WITCH
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,8,"Knowing that this is an A24 horror film, it usually has more creepy vibe rather than scary which I also like. The movie really portraits the said era. After the best Hereditary film, this comes after. Anya Taylor-Joy really is the best at horror films from her young age. She starts the film with being innocent and naive until she became omnipotent and that's a good character development since she is ""The Witch"". I knew the Queen's Gambit girl is the best at horror films. The movie is totally creepy and will leave you having goosebumps until the end. It totally depicts a girl going through maturity and comprehends that she'll eventually experience such chaos in her family. A really good movie to originate a folktale. The only criticism I personally have is how they talk, I sometimes cannot understand their conversation or is it just my perception that is low and besides it's from New England. Overall, there are certain parts that needs to augmentate but it's a 2015 film so, it may be the best!!!"
" WORST ""HORROR"" MOVIE EVER!
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,1,The horror is that this movie was made at all and wasted the time of anyone unfortunate enough to view. Beware The V V ITCHThe joke is on the audience because the titular character appears for two seconds at the very end.We can nap for free. Don't bother.
" A true Witch film
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,"The Witch is a dark and gritty take on traditional folklore that modern audiences are not familiar with nowadays. probably one of the best depiction of a witch. They are not beings in flashy colorful costumes and flashy spells. Witches are dark sadistic greedy creatures who affect the lands around them,the wildlife around them and the people around them.they use dark rituals and blood sacrifices . Those characteristics and attributes are shown in this film well. A family of extreme Puritans banish from their town for their extreme ways offers a perfect cast to fall victim to. With a heavy tone on religious themes shows concept of good over evil or evil over good? The movie has a slow paced atmosphere that helps fills the scenes with suspense& tension There's an absence of color in much in the film that Adds a sense of deprived life in these woods. The witch is a film that keeps it's audience of suspense and disbelief drawing you in and on Edge wondering what will the outcome for this Family be in the end."
" Dirty, disturbing and yet boring movie
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,1,"So first of all I'd like to say that this movie is definitely under the top 3 of the movies that left me feeling dirty afterwards. Watching everything unfold just feels deeply disturbing, so if you are into disturbing horror movies which aren't actually horror movies but yet wanna call themselves that, this movie is for you. I feel like movies like these should have their own genre, well actually they do, psychological thrillers, but even that is a little wishy washy. So the plot is incredibly boring and I just waited for something to happen for the entirety of the movie. The girls parents accuse her of being a witch while she isn't a witch, at the end she actually turns into a witch. Bravo. It is full of biblical references and Christianity and blabla. At the end I couldn't decide what I felt more, bored, disappointed or dirty."
" The Shining in 1630
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,8,"This folktale is based on literature, trials and documentations from darker times. You should not expect your average horror story when tuning into the debut of director Robert Eggers. He managed to compose a nice blend of thriller, suspense and a certain aesthetic. The sparse soundtrack emerges where necessary. The film was shot with mostly natural light and this makes the setting even more authentic. I am amazed how this movie could be shot in less than 30 days, considering the animals and little children involved.I have to admit, the singing of the kids and the constant crying of the woman is annyoing, but how else would you be dragged into this downward spiral of wickedness? As the story moves on boldly we witness the psychological terror that affects every family member in a different way. While the mother isolates herself in grieving the father tries to put reason or religion in the fatal happenings. Only the oldest daughter Thomasin manages to keep something like a clear head. When in fact she is the one in question.The length is perfect, the pacing great and the ending even surprised me. Give this film a try and watch it from different perspectives. If you focus specifically on acting, or the camera work you will notice many details, that drag you even further in the scene."
" The Best Wicked Witch Movie So Far
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,7,"To be honest, I am not a big fan of witch-themed movie, but I have watched a few, and none of them is as good as The VVitch. Its style is not quite as usual as other horror movie, making the movie unique. Brilliantly eerie scenography and cinematography create a thrilling and suspensing ambience. The conflict within a family and between their religious belief, society, the wild, also The Satan and Witch cleverness, transcends any other witch movie in my opinion. Another plus point, as the movie goes, you will keep guessing how the story will end, and that's what will keep you focus till the end of it."
" A bipolar feeling of this film
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,8,"I watched it a few years ago. Had to fast-forward the whole film coz I could barely stand for longer than 10 minutes. The pace was damn too slow! I gave it 1 star at the most.But this time, tonight, somehow I decided to use my best earbuds and tried immersing myself into its atmosphere. For 15 minutes, I told myself. And with the well-balanced sound effect, I finally enjoyed the whole film non-stop. I could totally feel the horror of witchcraft on a cursed farmland. How they struggled with their religious belief and how they encountered the horror are the main themes that give me a synergy of breathlessness.So, even I myself have such 2 bipolar responses to the film. Hence I can understand why the comments here are also bipolar as well. Your mood and audio setups really certainly very, very significant.If I have anything to criticise, that would be the accent they spoke. Oh gosh I found it quite hard to my ears!"
" 😴😴😴
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,1,This might be my least favorite movie of all time. The only thing slower than this movie is my 90 year old grandma driving on the freeway.
" True fear all around
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,8,"New England, 1630: a family, away from society, faces the forces of darkness, black magic and constant fear.A horror film that should be the standard for the genre, not ""1 in 1000"", as it turns out.The atmosphere created since the beginning leads the viewer to question the actions and motives of the characters, the narrative begins with doubts about their past, which forces the viewer to be alert to every detail, in order to try to understand what's going on in this weird family.The main factor is the psychological terror, based on religious fanaticism, typical of that time, and also on paranoia and tension accumulated between people who live inside a bubble, which in this case is not about comfort, but fear.The film takes various bits from various tales of supernatural folklore, and assembles a very interesting set."
" One of the worst, ever
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,4,An incredibly terrible snore-fest. The slowest 90 minutes or so you could ever sit through...
" A great movie with poor execution
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,3,"This movie was deep, it's a story about how a demon can fool you to do sin and fall into darkness even you are a religious person. Interesting right?What's good,Cinematography was great, beautiful film with good actors too, especially the older son, he is great, but for me the main actor just average.What's bad,Many plot holes and some illogical moments/scripts. As example, they said they were running out of food, but i saw an animals that can be eaten just infront of their house. The worse part in this movie was most every moments inside look flat with no intensity. I can't find a scary/creepy part in this movie. Should have done better then this"
" Good Atmosphere
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,6,"The actors and the cinematography are very good. The movie feels authentic.
The story has very good potential. The angle worked by the director is good.
It is a story about a family unable to fit in.
It is a time of puritanism.
They are basically expelled from the village, due to religious problems, so they move to a place near a big, primordial forest.
They cannot take it. Slowly, they lose their faith, and the mistrust and violence begin. Their descent into despair is very well filmed.
At the end, the supernatural twist is not bad, but it does not feel very genuine. It lacks something. Nevertheless, it is worthy of consideration.
I liked the movie. There is a lot of violence, be warned.
Also, the movie is not good if you are hard of hearing. It is better to have the subtitles on.
The movie deals with many things. You find religion and superstition, survival, fear, tenderness, repression, etc. It also has some fascination for "" the powers of darkness"".
People out there calling it a masterpiece are perhaps a bit overenthusiastic.
Nevertheless, it is a pretty good movie, much better than the average Hollywood flick."
" Love it or Hate it.
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,2,"The potential for this movie was amazing. The cinematography was good, the sound was good and even the acting wasn't THAT bad. Slow burner? someone forgot to light the gas on this one. The actual script itself consisted mainly of shouting and arguing that became rather annoying after a short while and reciting of prayers.The writer had many many opportunities to expand on certain elements of the movie to add suspense and to build the mood, however, seems to have been concentrating more on being historically accurate with speech and scenery than actually making the story remotely interesting. There were maybe 3 scenes where the witch made a very short appearance... I'm talking seconds, not even minutes. The film was more about religious paranoia than a witch and even then, the paranoia was mainly towards the end. Before that, it only really showed as constant bickering and shouting.The ending... oh wow... all I will say on that is ""facepalm!""."
" Wish more horror movies were like this
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"I admit that I am a history aficionado, but I went into this with a bit of skepticism. Just when I was becoming convinced the horror industry could not produce anything worthwhile, I came across this, and totally loved it.This is a Puritan style horror tale, rife with the dialogue and mindsets of the 17th Century. I did have to use the subtitles to catch all of the dialogue, but the atmosphere is just perfect. The spooky setting of the isolated family, beset with supernatural plagues, the cinematography and the acting crafted a superb film. Psychological horror, superstition and the dread of the unknown play out within each frame of this film, as it leads us to its surprising conclusion.Probably the best film of 2015. Will probably become an annual Halloween viewing for me."
" 6.9/10? hell no.
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,4,"This is a rare trash, is not worth more than three or four over ten"
" Fine study of witchcraft folklore behind this movie
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,8,"Part of the movie is fantasy, but some of the really weird stuff is indeed based on witch trials, legends of the horned god - and some of the conjurations are in fact quotations from the socalled Grimoires. Of course part of what we see is a bit exaggerated. But the tale is not far from the European traditions of witchcraft. I'm pretty sure that W.B. Yeats and Aleister Crowley would have enjoyed this movie. But alas, they are shadows of the past ..."
" It is extremely hard for a movie to make me feel scared, this movie did it perfectly
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,10,"How can i explain this piece? This movie seems like it is legitimately haunted, it feels as if i am watching a real tragedy unfold right there on my screen, i felt dirty after watching it, the movie's atmosphere makes you feel disturbed at every minute, and that is why it is so captivatingYou see, i love the sensation of being scared, unfortunately, it is not something i can achieve easily with movies nowadays, but this one made it different, they made so the threat on the movie was a real threat to the people of that age, which makes the movie even more scary, all the tones, the dialogues, the acting, the enviroment, everything contributes to this creepy uneasy feeling, and i love it, if you like horror movies, you will love this, watch it, but it's not for the faint of heart"
" A good movie with underused potential
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,6,"(+) the atmosphere is well built and we really feel oursleves immersed into this old pious world thanks to the use of old english(+) no jump scares, the tension builds up naturally(-) a bit disappointing to see the witch at the beginning, a good part of the mystery is spoiled(-) elements could have been more developped, such as the odd connection between the twins and the goat, from which we only get some hints, or the hardship of a family who has to forget its homeland, that is mentioned once by the mother(-) I did not like the ending, it would have been enough if the movie just ended when Thomasin ends up alone, and we don't even know what happened to the twins"
" OMG just go do ANYTHING else than watch this
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,1,"I wish I had those two hours back!
I kept hoping for some store arc or resolution or ANYTHING. Or the credits. Finally they came. What a waste of time.
¯\_(;/)_/¯"
" In my top ten
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,10,"If you are looking for modern bloody teen slasher movies that are pretty much all the same then don't bother with this. This has a much darker gothic feeling and not at all action packed but geniously put together and acted. I think the best way I can explain it is, I was bought up in a Christian household but think of myself as agnostic, this made me want to go to church and beg for forgiveness."
" Glad i ignored the 1 star reviews
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,9,"I rarely leave a review but i read so many negative opinions saying it's boring that i felt that i had to. I'm guessing those people never watched a truly boring movie because ""The witch"" is far from being one.Not recommended to Fast&Furios fans."
" Scroll down for the low reviews
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,1,"I dont even know where to start here. If you took the effort to scroll past the 9's and 10's, you can find a lot of people who -like me- feel robbed of their time. I didn't even like the acting, writing or suspense. Thinking about it, I dont think the actors did believe in the script. Oh wait, I have to give one very very big credit. To the child actor playing Caleb. HE WAS GOOD!!! kudos to you. That one scene....
Anyway, I hate to write bad reviews but I feel a warning should be in place here for people who hate bad endings. It was not bad though.... it was insultingly nonsensical."
" I didn't get it
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,5,It had its moments but overall I didn't get it and I got bored in the middle. I'm not exactly sure what happened sometimes and the whole thing was slightly frustrating.
" Worst movie I ever seen in my life
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,4,"I know many critics give high star and use those word I never heard in my whole life. But this movie is not even a 1 sacry jump scene. We don't know why there family outside the town. I love some nature scene and dark themes but movie is so so so boring if u are horror movie fan and want to watch scary movie then don't even think about this movie. I watched this movie and wait and wait there is a scary moment but the movie end not even 1 scary jump scene came. Acting is perfect.
Everyone give there 100% but there is no story in movie and till the end you don't know what Director want to show us.
I watched worst movie of my life.
I am not a professional critics but i know what is mu taste"
" This movie made me feel bad spirituality speaking
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,1,This movie made me feel bad spirituality speaking.
" A great experience, with horror as desert
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,8,"Great cinematography, great acting, great music, great pacing and last but certainly not least. Great horror. With nearly every scene you can see the thought put into framing, lighting and blocking of the scenes. Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson and Harvey Scrimshaw each deliver great performances in which you feel every emotion the characters feel. Anger, anguish, wrath, pain, sorrow are all portrayed in the most intimate way imaginable. The score to this movie builds intensity that can only be matched by the likes of Dunkirk. Silence builds a great contrast to this. The horror is decent, but people who are not so fond of nudity might be a little put off by the amount of it.Yet another movie that I recommend watching. This should also be enjoyable for people who are not into horror."
" Brooding and moody
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,9,"Brilliant. Loved every tension filled minute.Avoid if you like the modern, slasher, jump cut style of movie making on offer these days. This builds much slower and earns it's ending."
" Film making lives!
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,8,"It's seldom to see a film these days that tells a clearly deliniated story, brings together an ensemble of actors of equal caliber and demonstrates how the collective effort of making that film results in an effort that will stand the test of time. If the topic interests you, make the effort to see this. It will not disappoint."
" Brilliant movie
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,8,"You know a movie is brilliant when it lacks splatter and silly jump scares but still manages to make you feel uncomfortable, uneasy, worried and scared.I thoroughly enjoyed my time watching it.Give it a shot,"
" Somewhere between science and folklore there is another World
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,5,"I'm a huge fan of horror! The exorcist, Hereditary - small movies and those small gems that are not Hollywood.A friend of mine (who is digging witchcraft) recommended me this movie some years ago.So with no expectations I watched. And I'm that impressed.The idea is that nature itself and witchcraft are one and the same - the story starts promising with an omnious happening.From there on we see a family slowly being torn apart and from there on its downhill, with a finale I found - well, i don't know.The technical side of it is too notch. The cinematography is splendor and settles with a moody New England and folklore vibe that is perfect.
The acting. The two small children a genuinely creepy and one can't stop wondering. Yeah, it's derailing the main point of the central character. The mother stands out though! She is a hard mother to love and the acting is downright sublime. She steals every scene she is in. What is less than good is the father that from beginning to end had me cringe - it's too much and some might argue otherwise... But when it annoys you through the film, well then it kinda destroys it. This surely has to do with the material. Narrative is important as a minimum and a huge amount of time goes talking to god, the way they did back then. The movie is littered with these sequences, and while it might make it feel more authentic - it detracts in some key moments from the shear terror this family is experiencing.Who is God and who is Satan? Well, nature is a tough companion, it depends on when and where you were born. That's probably the best interpretation I can think of. When rabbits go insane and goats are Lucifer then we all know the time and age.To be fair with this movie, since others are praising it - I would strongly suggest people comparing this with a movie contender like The Others.So a 5 star rating is for a movie somewhere in the middle. Not bad, not goodBut then again, if you're into witchcraft it nails it, I guess."
" A Film for Film's Sake
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,9,"Calling The Witch a horror movie is somewhat misleading. Fan of thrillers? - It's a good movie. Fan of Dark Mysteries? - It's a good movie. Fan or horror? It's a good movie. Fan of Historical movies? Hell it might even make you happy too.This movie takes the story of fear, paranoia, and the fear of God not to the extreme, but to what people at the time truly believed. The slow burning tension is masterfully created not only by the combination of the acting, the cinematography, and the writing. Even the subtle score is well put together and not over the time, not brewing up to cheap jump scares or slashing moments.
I myself am a fan of horror, however most horror movies often leave me feeling unfulfilled and unsatisfied. For those who feel this way on an even more dissatisfied level, this movie may be the one that brings the genre of Horror to a level playing field for your interests.Watch The Witch, but with expectations of it being a movie. Not a horror movie or a thriller or whatever genre bending semantic you may want to use, just go into it with an open mind and expect what you would watching anything that wasn't horror. Watch the characters think critically and problem solve, thrust themselves into new situations as the mystery unfolds of a fear birthed lore."
" One of the best horror movies of the 2010s
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,8,"The first time I saw The Witch, I didn't know what to think. Upon rewatch and letting the film sit, I have grown to love it. Great acting, cinematography that captures the tone and setting perfectly, genuinely smart scares that don't rely on cheap jump scares and a haunting musical score. The Witch is one of A24's best movies and one of the best horror films in the past ten years.Taking place in 1630s New England, a family exiled from their Puritan community move away and build a farmstead beside these woods but not long after they arrive, strange things start happening and that's all I'll say.The best thing about the film is the look. The cinematography and lighting is fantastic as it perfectly captures the look and feel of the situation and tone the characters are in. The craziest thing about this is that the lighting was natural which makes the movie surprisingly more creepy.The one thing that makes the film creepy for me is the music. It's superb. I remember watching the trailer for this movie back when it first came out and that music really sold me on watching the movie. I get chills everytime I watch that trailer. And the music in the trailer is in the movie and it's used so well in the movie. It really sells me on the creepiness of it.Overall, The Witch is phenomenal. It's creepy, engaging from start to finish, has great acting and surprising rewatch value. The only real flaw with the film is the ending, I feel like it could've been better. Other than that, the movie is outstanding and definitely worth watching."

" Good finale
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,6,"When i started the movie I thought, how on earth can something be that beige ? There's no color in the setting, no color (so to say) in the dialogue nor in the actual story or acting. But than things evolved, sunk in, and ultimately made sense. It's a very precise picture about a very specific time hence it does bring new aspects to the genre. Religion/superstition played an essential role and lead the path to everything portrayed in VVitch. My favorite part was the black goat / devil actually responding to the questions and the aspect in how he lured her into the circle by promising her all she ever wants in life."

" A vvell-done movie
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,7,"This film doesn't rely on cheap jump scares to deliver its scares. The form of horror this film gives you is by taking you in the world of the characters - rather one character in particular - and the terror that gradually leads to the climax of the story. The bonds between the family members are pushed to the limit as they grow increasingly desperate and some become antagonistic to one another, charging each scene with a sense of profound unease, so you're never certain of what will happen next. That is the masterstroke of the film, the continual slow-burn tension and uncertainty that will keep the viewer disoriented and searching for concrete answers. The film pivots on metaphors, symbolism, period specific dialogue, and character choices to convey a representation of the biblical stories it centers around. Technically, this film is mind blowing; Production design successfully creates a sinister environment that reeks of evil, and the peripherals of the isolated surroundings only add more creepiness to the whole setting. The gorgeously looming and oppressively atmospheric cinematography, as well as the sweeping and dreary score, that often imitates what is happening on the screen, building tension to a crescendo that adds to the horror of this film. In terms of the performance, the ensemble cast does a fantastic job.
Overall, While I do understand the themes, ambiguity, and purpose behind this movie I didn't really find it that interesting or scary for that matter. The reason why critics and audience are so divisive on this film is the same reason why critics and audience are divisive on ""Hereditary"" - they are both are a slowburn horror films that depend on creepy atmosphere, exploiting tension and unsettling imagery to delivers their scares. People don't mostly appreciate that type of horror, just like me to some extent but you still got to appreciate as they're real work of art."

" An excellent, moody slow-burn horror film
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,10,"The Witch is a horror film directed by Robert Eggers, starring Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, and Kate Dickie. It follows an American Puritan family in the 1630s living in exile at the edge of a nearby forest as they are tormented by hostile otherworldly forces.Firstly, the acting. Anya Taylor-Joy's performance as Thomasin, eldest daughter of the family, is wonderfully intense and sincere in displaying the hardships of the life of a young Puritan girl, especially one whose role in the family is so thankless and ignored. Throughout the film, she tries to win her mother's approval and dutifully support her family, but is instead repeatedly used as a scapegoat for much of the family's woes. Ralph Ineson plays gruff but well-meaning father William, and Kate Dickie plays distant mother Katherine. Every character feels real, no doubt helped by the authentic dialogue accurate to the time period, which must have been difficult to remember and was painstakingly researched by the production team.Secondly, the atmosphere. The whole film has a constant air of tragedy and sadness, and even in scenes where there is nothing overtly scary happening, the viewer will be on the edge of their seat, expecting something horrible to happen, but no. The tension builds and builds. Over the course of the film, the bonds between the family members are pushed to the limit as they grow increasingly desperate and some become hostile to one another, charging each scene with a sense of profound unease, so you're never certain of what will happen next. That is the masterstroke of the film, the continual ""slow-burn"" tension and uncertainty that will keep audiences disoriented and searching for concrete answers.The film, aside from being a horror film focused largely on exploiting tension and unsettling imagery, is also an excellent demonstration of how harsh the average Puritan family's life was at the time, out in the wilderness without support, and how quickly a family can succumb to paranoia thanks to stress and tragedy. Thanks to the mixture of more mundane family drama and gripping terror, there are many ways to interpret the film's events, and I am glad that the film allows for that flexibility since I feel that horror, with its basis in creating fear, should let audiences draw on their own fears and experiences while watching.In conclusion, the film is an excellent ""slow-burn"" horror film, with masterful performances, a great mood and atmosphere, and the benefit of being vague enough to allow for multiple interpretations.Score: 10/10"
" Historic
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,8,"I am a fan of 17th century New England history.This film has some serious creds when it comes to historic accuracy. It is well filmed,cast and written!It is a film you need to watch twice to let the finer points sink in.
It delves a lot into religion , dogma,social pressure,feminism,arbitrary power, conventionality, history, sexual desire, gender roles, the wilderness, and family interaction. Some of these reflect a period orientation,others are,more,modern facets.
Most of movie reflects the thinking of the time period. Christian fundamental ideas. The Devil was a given in their lives. Most people today doubt the devil exists ,doubt god exists, doubt witchs, the devils minions exist. The real evil in this movie is within this family,because of their beliefs.
The wilderness beyond civilization plays a big part in this movie. Exile, freedom, beyond convention, liberation, challenge, solitude, isolation, a howling wilderness filled with wild beasts and wild men.
This is not a fast paced movie. It is more a thinkers movie.The pacing is slow and the problems mount slowly. Without the support of community , they cannot deal with the familys internal issues.
The only flaw I saw for the time period, was the horse.Farm power in those days,early -mid 1600's in New England ,was ox powered.
The only Indians in this movie are seen when the family is exiled from the settlement. The Indians are welcome in the town ,but the family is,not."
" Robert Eggers knows his craft well!
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,8,"Robert Eggers' directorial debut ""The Witch"" is eccentric with its discrete ipseity. It corresponds to historical folklores in an aphotic, grotesque manner. Using creepy elements; it engulfs you through its aptly created ambiance & the very sense of desolation!
Obtaining its nuances from traditional lore, mythical legends; The film displays the horrifying events manifest upon an alienated family residing out in the wilderness. Bewitched by an evil presence deep into the woods, a series of mischievous events follow through.Technically it is affluent with conspicuous Cinematography coupled with unsettling set of imagery that will surely make you feel distressed. A haunting piece of a soundscore, thrivingly preserving an eerie & appalling atmosphere throughout the entirety. Storywise it just falls short in providing enough rationale about the erratic events that take place, but the Screenplay has been unmarred from any of those demerits.Playing the eldest daughter, Anya Taylor-Joy is the scene-stealer here! Enacting the role of an agitated teenager; she elegantly outshined everyone else. With those broad, sparkling eyes; she uttered remorse, agony & malice to the best of her ability. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie as the susceptible parents were simply astonishing.
The same impression applies to the other child actors as well!All things considered, this has been a bodacious affair. There was certainly a yearn for further elucidation regarding some of the story points; yet needless to say, I dig its stylized execution and the specific way it's been laid out.With only two feature films so far, Robert Eggers made quite an impression; making it to the list of my go-to directors with such ease."
" Like watching a foreign movie without subtitles
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,5,"That's how I found it. I couldn't understand what was being said a lot of the time though I was still able to get the plot as it's not exactly a whodunnit plot wise. Maybe it was because of the dialogue but I just didn't care about them and not a lot actually happens. Reading others saying you don't get real horror and prefer jump scares but that's not true at all. Hereditary wasn't a jump scare movie but was better, BY A LOT as was It Follows. Two movies that use the setting and story too much better effect."
" Metaphor for delusion and obsession in 2021

" Historic superstition come to life
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,6,"Image a family from England 400 years ago in the American wilderness. This is a wonderfully realised portrayal of such a family. A pious family with all the superstitions that people used to believe in.
The beginning is beautiful and the ambiance is chilling and enticing, but I didn't really grow to love the characters and to me their actions didn't always feel right. The fantasy elements of the story worked cinematically but not as a story and there we get to the heart of the problem: there isn't really any character development. All the actors do a fine job, but it still falls rather flat in the end."
" Seems authentic and eerie
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,10,"This was a very very good movie. The acting is superb and the old language used adds to the authenticity of it.So so tired of movies set in times hundreds of years ago where women have beautifully coiffed hair, men swear and use slang that would never have been used, people have straight white teeth, and they kiss with open mouths. No! In the 1600s these were God-fearing people who would never swear as it would be a blasphemy. They never revealed any promiscuity for fear of being stricken down. Plain folks worked and little else. We have learned our lessons but men were considered superior and that's just the way it was.On top of this it was a good story with several layers to analyze. One of my favourite movies in the last few years."
" Worst movie ever, of dystopian Christian horror, bleak and weak
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,1,"Dystopian Christian horror.
It isn't a horror film but the imagination of an evil downward spiral tearing a family apart that is trying their best to cling on to their own failing Christian sentiments, beliefs and faith as theirs absolutely nothing else left as they perceive themselves now as outcasts, due to a matter of some unexplained or largely unacknowledged principles while these beliefs are failing miserably, as the film does with it.
Anything bad that is happening to them is irrationally identified as being evil based on belief and not on what's shown or explained within the context of the movie but by a lecture of Christian dogmatic belief throughout. That's ultimately the basis of this film, Christian culture dramatised as perceived of being this period, with ideas of witchcraft thrown in to explain and justify their own misery, they effectively create the cause for cursing themselves and being at war with themselves. While using the oldest daughter as a vehicle to dump all their hate and anger and then have the audacity and ignorance to call her evil and not see this as being the very evil they have created by their own actions.
This is really the only thing I had taken away from the movie but it will undoubtedly be lost and of little interest to many people as it's not the movie we came to see, nor did we expect a philosophical tale of understanding and if we did, we'd want at least a good movie with it to get this point across.
I'd seriously have to call into question the legitimacy of the high ratings of this movie.
I watched it wanted to like it and wanting so much for something to just happen but it just doesn't, this movie should come massively under the category of misadvertised and be enough to disappoint the audience on that basis alone. It's like walking into an action movie that turns out to be a musical.
It's just a boring bleak film. It's acted well but it's also a terrible story or the lack of a story that makes this so bad that makes you want to slit your wrists, especially if you've clung on for dear life hoping that at some point a story will come together but it never does. It's a shambles of a movie and has a very limited audience at best which is probably why it had been missold originally to target a wider audience it doesn't deserve.
You'd only watch this movie to see just how bad it actually is and probably out of disbelief that so many people must have taken tranquillisers or a knock to their head before watching and reviewing this or are cunningly trying to entice you to go through the same agony they've just experienced, as misery loves company and they want you to suffer it if they had to do so. Just don't watch it if you're expecting a horror, mystery or anything intriguing of the supernatural, occult or want a suspenseful experience of any kind other than a period drama that exists alongside music that should accompany a horror movie. If you're silly enough to believe the main purpose of this movie will be focusing on a witch or witchcraft don't watch this movie you'll be massively disappointed and letdown."

" Establishes a real, convincing sense of dread and impending horror. Too bad the ending is fumbled.
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"THE WITCH is a tough movie to dislike, even as it is a tough movie to get through. It suffers from the curse of many otherwise good horror movies (such as IT FOLLOWS)...the ending stinks. Frankly, it does seem tough to find good endings to supernatural stories...once you see the horror before you, it somehow becomes less than the dread building up to it. Good horror movies and bad horror movies often suffer from it. It's a ""short story"" problem. By this, I mean...think about some of the great short stories you've read in your life. Many of them end with abrupt, surprise endings (OCCURRENCE ON OWL CREEK BRIDGE) or perhaps just sort of end (50% of modern day short stories). So you've invested 20 minutes of your time in a just so-so story. Or maybe the surprise ending is abrupt, but it's fun given how little of your time you've given up. You enjoyed the prose, and then the ending wasn't too great...but overall, you're content with the time you spent. NOW, turn that around....you've spend $20+ dollars for the pair of movie tickets. Maybe you bought snacks. You sat in the dark for 90+ minutes. And for 88 minutes, you were having a pretty good time, then suddenly the movie ends. BLAIR WITCH, THE LAST EXORCISM, etc. etc. NOW you feel cheated and disappointed. And for me, THE WITCH fell into this trap, and for that it should get a 2 star rating, perhaps.But, the building of atmosphere and dread is top notch. Some truly creepy and disturbing things happen. The movie is set in puritanical times, and follows a family that is SO puritanical, that they've been kicked out of town!! Dad is the fanatic, and of course his wife and children follow along. They build a house and homestead near a forest, and almost immediately, weird stuff starts to happen. I won't describe it all, but much involves animals and VERY creepy younger siblings. The story is told mostly through the eyes of the oldest daughter, a girl on the edge of ""womanhood"" (to use a somewhat icky cliche). I put it this way, because her own father mistrusts his daughter when he sees she's growing up. He believes we are all sinful, and women especially are not to be trusted. So when bad things start happening, who does he blame first? Anyway, the atmosphere is awesomely done, and the acting is really top notch. These are fairly inexperienced performers, but they do very, very well. And when all hell finally starts to break loose, you feel pretty bad for some of the things that start happening to these people...as alien and extreme as they may seem.And really, the entire setting and time of the film is well done. I felt that the details of everyday life, the set and costume design, etc. was all really excellent. Low budget, but never cheap. Cinematography was good. The minimal special effects were good. Only the sound mix seemed off...but I can't say if that was the theater's fault or the film. But sometimes I had a hard time understanding everyone. But I really appreciated the feeling of immersion, not just in a creepy atmosphere but into a world that felt real yet unfamiliar. This was an extra touch that really made me respond to the film. I give it four stars, but would hesitate to recommend to anyone. It's slow moving (VERY) and it disappoints with its ending. For me, the other parts of the film overcame all that. But I can EASILY see that this would not be the case for other viewers. I will probably watch it again after the blu-ray is released...but I bet I'll watch it alone."
" Really boring
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,2,"People like to claim it's ""Psychological horror"" just to excuse it being bad, i love psyhcological horror but this is called boring. Plot isn't there, nothing is to be honest except actors."

" Sublime horror with a historical backdrop
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,8,"I must admit when I first saw this pop up on my Netflix choices as 'new' and saw that it had been released five years ago, I immediately became sceptical.With so many offerings in the vein of the Ring (2002), Saw (2004) AHS (American Horror Story) with the additional in vogue mashing of as many genres as possible, it's perfectly acceptable to be cynical before viewing any new horror films, wih many of todays most respected directors losing credibility in attempting to produce sophisticated, overly intricate, unnecessarily gory...well lets just say there are a lot of formulaic traps one can fall into with this genre, and fans now demanding more realism, more accuracy, continuity and authenticity and more than ever before.This film is set in the New England era of the mid 17th Century, with a small family being banished from their community for the so-called transgressions of their father who is accused of inappropriately preaching the gospels.The family (comprised of Mother and matriarch Katherine (Kate Dickie) Father William ( Ralph Ineson) eldest daughter and now hollywood celebrity (Anya Taylor-Joy in her first credited role) as Thomasin, along with younger brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) and the two youngest apart from the infant Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Grainger, Lucas Dawson).The family quickly settle on the edge of an ominous wood working hard to grow crops to survive.
Early on Thomasine is playing peek-a-boo with the samll infant boy, who mysteriously vanishes into thin air - and this is when things begin to fall apart.Without spoiling the plot, I was most impressed by the clever and subtle use of the films score to build a palpable, almost visceral sense of dread coming from the dark and uninviting woods.There is also an equally palpable feeling of claustraphobia in addition to dread, and despite the family's dedication to prayer and the maxims of the church, things just keep getting worse.What is a relief is the time spent on skillfully building suspense - not though cheap jump scares or other familiar and tired tropes, but through the interactions of the characters and their deteriorating health in response to the traumas visited upon them.Anja Taylor-Joy seems to have mastered the art of the extreme close-up, and one can tell that she is a skilled actress.This film is truly eerie, haunting and suspenseful, in a way that is almost exhausting emotionally, keeping the viewer engaged - as the plot moves forward the characters true motivations are difficult to discern.I especially appreciate historical accuracy in every aspect of a period piece such as this, and despite some minor mistakes reportedly with speech accuracy, Eggers does a wonderful job in his directorial debut.I wouldn't jump to say that this is high brow, overly layered or too allegorical, as some films aim to be - this film succeeds by relying not on exclusively visual triggers but by building upon auditory(musical, instrumental and vocal), emotional (the interplay between characters and their obvious trepidation) elements as well as anticipatory suspense which heightens the tension.I was immediately reminded of the screenplay I studied in high school - 'the Crucible', a loose and questionable account of the Salem witch trials.According to the films trivia much of the material was gathered from various primary sources, personal and official accounts which must also be applauded.A great example that a horror film need not be full of monsters, ghosts and demons dripping with gore, black and white notions of 'good v evil', and other oversimplified narratives of black and white morality and/or notions of the spiritual."
" Doesn't Have Enough
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,3,"Lets start with the positive.The atmosphere, the realistic village/home setting, the visuals and the audio are all absolutely outstanding. They really are, you can see the amount of effort the crew have gone to to make an authentic world for their film.The negative.The actual movie. God it's so boring. The basics of the story is fine and had the concepts of something interesting to explore (and does somewhat) but a lack of real drama and punch rob the movie of the factors that could have made this a great movie."
" Good acting and imagery, very bad script.
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,5,"I will be brief and to the point. Brilliant acting, amazing photography and atmosphere. Good camera work and directing. Extremely bad scenario, supernatural, horror is forced. I can write a lot about why the script is lame but I wish to keep this short, therefore in a few words, the script is weak philosophically, spiritually and psychologically. Again, very very forced supernatural horror."
" A really great debut
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,8,"This film encompasses what it was like during the 1600s when religion was the main force that ruled over humans. Instead of uniting them, religion, more often than not, did exactly the opposite - that is the product of humanity's lack of truly understanding what religion is about and how to live in agreeance with its nature and God. Seven members of the family each represent one of the seven deadly sins, and it's fitting that they all end up accordingly to them. This film shows that believing in God and praying each night is not what religion is about - it's about being honest with yourself and others around you, and working your way to build strong relationships, both with yourself and others, which each character in this film failed to do - instead, they kept it inside and ended up severing the bonds between each other, all in their own unique way. Overall, this was an incredible debut from Robert Eggers, who continued to deliver with ""The Lighthouse"", and I can't wait to see what he does next.
8/10"
" I guess it's for grownups...
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,8,"Having seen many reviews where people didn't understand the film and its plot, my only assumption would be ""I guess it's for grownups"".
Having said that, however, I think it could definitely be shown and analyzed in high schools (not American, they wouldn't get it either) or even colleges for the technical aspects.Acting was on spot, cinematography gave us oil paintings that could have been hanging on museum walls. I found no plot-holes, that is, I understood the point of the bloody movie. And it fulfilled the wasteful need for a genre in 'horror', but in the way Brando described it in that other great one.Much work was put into the language of the time, the robes, the housing, the lifestyle and, more importantly, the way of thinking of the time and the place.I won't give it a 10/10 cause it's a theme we've seen far too many times already (it didn't teach me anything new) but it definitely is the best movie I've seen about that time and place and deserving of your sitting on a couch and unnerving yourself as it unfolds..."

The main actor's voice (William) was slightly irritating and has such a distinctive voice, all I could think about was him doing voice overs for MANY history and UFO documentary's, so his voice was so off putting. The accents were also not at all consistent. However, the story was interesting, despite all the distractions."
" Not your typical horror movie
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,6,"I liked the fact that they used information from the period to construct the movie (otherwise I would have deducted a few stars).Unfortunately, I wish the script writers would have made the family more likeable:The twins were extremely annoying. I get it that small children can act obnoxiously. I get it that they communicated with the goat, so their actions were supposedly influenced by the creature. However, the twins were unbearable. Especially the boy. (If you can, watch the ""making of"" documentary to see how frustrating it was to get the boy to eat the bread. I would have found a different (much better) child actor after the sixth take).The Father was OK (given his Puritan roots), but the part about covering up the sale of his wife's heirloom made me dislike him. Also, why was he dismissed from the church at the beginning? At some point, I'll rewatch the first part of the movie with the captions turned on. Maybe it will make sense. He also seemed pretty useless as the head of the household.The Mother was annoying in nearly every scene. I understand that she's was mourning the loss of the baby and she wanted to go back to England, blah, blah, blah. She was a constant nag.The older son was depicted as a perv as he lusted after his older sister. OK. I understand that they're in the middle of nowhere and the kid is starting to notice girls, but come on. The skeeze factor made me dislike the son.The older daughter was OK. (I like her in most of her other movies). However, the script seemed to fall flat for her. Did her parents intend to sell her as a ""maid"" to a richer family or did they just want one less mouth to feed?Overall, I didn't really care what happened to any character. This could have been a very good movie if the script (and some of the acting) was better. This is not a horrible movie, but turn on the closed captions from the very start if you want to make sense of any of it."
" Very captivating
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,8,"I love the way this movies depicts the hardships the settlers had to conquer. It shows human suffering that I've read about that wasn't thought in school. It's a great thriller horror film that captured my attention. It was a simple story that was easy to follow, yet intriguing and kept me in tuned. Great movie."
" I didn't care for the movie
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,2,Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea?!! I see a lot of good reviews and that's what made me watch the movie but it was crazy to me. Then i couldn't understand what they were saying half of the time they're accents in the movie were very thick. I tried to cut on the CC but it didn't work so i was struggling to understand what they were saying the whole time. It was slow as well and wasn't really scary to me. Anyway. Check it out for yourself
" A masterpiece that isn't for everyone
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,10,"The Witch is an amazing atmospheric horror film, I'm reluctant to call it a horror as it's mostly a drama but there's always a sense of unease so I think it does slot into the horror category overall.The plot is not mainstream Hollywood at all, it's quite slow moving which may put people of if they're expecting quick action, scares and gore, it's best described as a slow burn. It involves themes of religion, isolation and, to a lesser degree, lack of finances.The acting was phenomenal, Anya Taylor-Joy was brilliant as the naïve but determined daughter and the hugely underrated actor Ralph Ineson was convincing as the stoic and hardworking William (the Father). Also notable is Kate Dickie as the mother and Harvey Scrimshaw as Thomasin's little brother Caleb.Cinematography is another strong point, the colour schemes are used extremely sparingly and skilfully, not quite being black and white but not dashed with so much colour as to lose the film's tone. Every shot is intelligent just like the director's other film The Lighthouse.10/10: A subtle masterpiece, thought provoking and brilliant. It will be very interesting to see what other films Robert Eggers directs."
" This movie is too much for some people
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,"People who didn't like this movie, only like films like saw, anabelle,insidious those films that have jumps scares and are east to watch, they thing is boring because the don't like character development, this film has great performances and pace, don't listen to the kids that say it is boring.."
" ''Thou shall not understand without subtitles''
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,8,"I already knew a fair bit going into this movie but that definitely did not taint the experience. That said, title joke aside, subtitles..must need unless you're fluent in 17th century poetic english. Nothing to do with bad audio balance or anything.This is one of those movies that really transports you to such a different time in the world, even though it involves fantasy and fairy tales that are easy to digest and make fun of now. A couple hundred years ago it doesn't seem too far fetched especially with how tightly bound people were with religion. So you do really have to believe in that and put yourself in their shoes for this film to work. If you are christian, and a strong one at a that, I could imagine this movie having a more profound impact.The directing is top notch, from the very first shot of the jury, it's engrossing. The location is not diverse at all, but still they manage to find different angles and every shot feels different. Even though you are in the same house/area it's always show in a different way. The pacing is done well, though for a traditional ''horror'' movie I'd say it falls below the bar of what you'd ''expect''. There much more focus on the setting, the world, the characters, and religion. Yes there are a few moments of horror but it's sparse.The music is great. Really draws you in but also there's a lot of silence used in this movie which I can always appreciate.The acting is top notch. The male lead is undeniably captivating with his voice and way of speaking. But the young female performs just as good. If anything the small cast in this movie is just fantasti.The story. I'm a bit iffy on this. As much as I enjoyed the movie it felt somewhat lackluster in its ending. The moment after the mother is killed by Thomasin the movie quite quickly jumps into the ending and wraps it up very fast. Leaving you kind of deserted after the entire family drama. Also the whereabouts of the two little kids are also left unknown which seemed somewhat sloppy. I guess you could presume they were offered in the final scene and with their blood or whatever gave the witches power again. Because we also saw this at the start of the movie although I thought it was only limited to newborns to be sacrificed... Now a movie doesn't need to answer everything, but such a detailed and tight woven family in a very contained story.. I think it missed out.But all in all, I'd recommend this movie, it's not a style of film you come across a lot and it's worth a watch just for that, besides the fantastic directing, acting..etc8/10"
" Boring - Confusing - Annoying - Frustrating - Stupid - WAAAASTE OF TIME!!!!!
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,1,"After reading the reviews here and hearing about the surprising success of this film, I was eager to watch it. I love plots involving history pieces as well as the possible paranormal. But as I started watching this movie, I found myself praying that there was just a slow build. Unfortunately, I found myself hoping for that up until the very end. The characters were annoying at best. The various elements and ideas introduced to move the plot along seemed to be only minimally explored. The two worst characters in my opinion, were the twins who, from the beginning, gave off an air that they could be evil. Yet when it is confirmed that they had been talking to the devil via a farm animal, the directors/writers still somehow maintained their characters as innocent children. The sporadic intense sequences seemed more tragic than spooky. And the ending was completely insane. A girl watches her whole family get murdered and is scared half to death then instantly decides that she wants to join a coven of naked floating women? Really? I was extremely disappointed in this film and even more in the misleading reviews on this site. I even double checked to make sure that I had watched the same film as those reviewing. So now I am just wondering if I can have the 1 and 1/2 hours of my life back...?"
" Eggers is a research scholar
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,9,"I have seen his other films, some how i left Witch unseen for some reason, lately i have come to know that the director is a brilliant student of cinema.We can see discipline in his work, and mostly the stories he choses are the explanations or historical notes of the tales and fantasies.For example if we take ""Witch"". We have seen in other movies and in stories how witches looks and the story goes to a direction on the plans and destination of those witches, but here and in other films of Egger, He defines the reason how and why one could be a witch. Its a steady and strong strategy for using historics in films,Hes nailing it, just imagine hes giving background stories for the tales that hes been heard before, when he makes new in the future, how vigorously dark it would be..!"
" Huge disappointment
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,2,"Main gripe - I had to put on subtitles to understand the thick, heavy accents. Knowing they were speaking English pulled me out of a suspension of disbelief. This was supposed to be disturbing psychological horror, which I love, but grew bored about 45 minutes in (about when I decided to put on subtitles). What a missed opportunity."
" Different Kind of Horror movie
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,9,"A family discarded from the society, lives near the woods. And the bad things starts to happen. The Witch is not a regular supernatural horror movie. It is a different kind of horror movie. It doesn't give you random jump-scares from ghosts appearing in the scenes. But it psychologically impacts the viewers with the drama and story-telling. The 1630s England era has been shown beautifully. English language is little different in this movie as it took place in 1630s. Anya Taylor-Joy delivers impressive performance.
'The Witch' has good storyline, fresh concept and great direction. A must watch movie for the whole new horror experience."
" Unnerving
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,7,"I watched this movie because it was recommended to be ""historically accurate"" in the sense of their beliefs of the time, way of life etc.As someone who studied witches in my undergrad, it was interesting to watch. One critique is that historically those branded as witches were typically elderly women and/or widows. Powerful women, those very rare women, who inherited money from their husbands, were branded as witches. Killing them off was a way to maintain the status quo and steal their money (double win for them.) Also elderly women on the fringes of society were targeted because they were easy targets (few connections to anyone etc.)It is true that they thought witches were the devils minions and such utter nonsense. A very serious film based upon a very absurd belief."
" great acting, atmosphere, psychology
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,10,"True dark horror, relief from do many stupid slashers. It is intelligent, very well played, with good script. Sooo underrated"
" Give Me That Old Time Religion!
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. It takes place in the time of the Salem Witch Trials. A Calvinist minister, his wife, and five children are forced out of the small town in which they live. They have few practical skills and are at the mercy of the wilderness. Thomasin, the beautiful daughter maintains her sanity through most of the film as the others fall apart. But there is something truly dark at work. Excellent film but not for most viewers."
" The Witch: A Psychological Paranoia
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,7,"The Witch is a movie based on a family living in New England in the 1630s. At the beginning we see the family leaving a community over some dispute and they begin a new life all by themselves out in the woods. Soon after, the eldest child of the family Thomasin (played by Anya Taylor-Joy) can be seen playing with the new born child in the family out in an open field, close to the forest. And all of a sudden the new born baby disappears in front of her and thus rolls out the the very beginning of the destruction of the family. Because of such incident Thomasin is hated by her mother, and slowly we see incidents keep happening to the family which put suspicions on her. Although this a horror movie, but there are barely any scary scene. Unlike most of the horror movies there are no jump scares, no disfigured appearances. Instead it slowly builds up the plot of the movie and plays an interesting turn of events at the end. There are not much to talk about the the characters - the only important character is, of course, Thomasin. One other thing I liked so much about the movie is the setting, really astonishing. The Witch mesmerizes the audience by not letting them bore for a moment with sustained scenes of psychological paranoia."
" 1 star reviewers should go and watch jump scares
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,8,People reviewing this as 1 and 2 stars are the ones who likes just stupid jump scare plotless stuff. This is really good film in every aspect.
" Forced to become a witch
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,8,"After they left the plantation in the New England, they faced difficulties and the mother thought they were cursed as her youngest son disappeared and Caleb died and was damn*d. Caleb got lost in the woods with his sister and found the house the witch and met the witch the beautiful witch with the red hood and kissed by her which made him dam*ed. The father wasn't the master of the family. He can't hunt, he can't grow crops all he can do is chop wood as his daughter said to him. The other 2 kids believed their older sister is a witch. They even pretended not to be able to recite their prayers to make their parents believe that she's a witch. They stopped pretending when their father said he'd cut their heads off like Abraham did to his son. They spoke to the black goat. The black goat made them do it. The black goat and the hate in the wood.
I liked how she breastfed the raven while the white goat fed the witch in the shed with the kids with them. The black goat was the devil indeed and killed the father. And the mother kept thinking it was all her innocent daughter who did all of this. She had to kill her mother. She killed her while hugging her. And then the black goat spoke to her too. It pledged him a good life and the whole world to see. She joined the other witches around the fire and the black goat with them. They suspended in the air along with her. They made her a witch. They did it."
" Not perfect, but dark and twisted.
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,7,"For anyone saying this acting is ""horrible"", that simply isn't true. For anyone saying the script is bad, read more books. For anyone saying the plot doesn't make any sense, read The Crucible.The acting was phenomenal, the story was dark, the suspense was high. Anyone rating this movie a 1 quite literally doesn't understand the basics of a movie.Watch this movie, form your own opinion."
" Not a movie for mainstream horror fans, slow burning, great acting, 1600s speak
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,8,"The type of horror this movie exhibits isn't the standard formula used in every film that comes out of suspense and jumscare, suspense in jumpscare. This movie instead prefers to slowly build and hold the tension as you watch this family fall apart. There is only really one or two jumpscares that I cant think of.
The story is somewhat lackluster and is instead more of a backdrop to provide an experience on.
The acting is fantastic the whole movie, especially impressing from the younger members in the cast, I don't know how some people seem to think it was so bad.
They speak like English immigrants from the 1600s which some people seem to really struggle with understanding but REALLY impacts the whole movie to immerse you."
" Brilliantly shot.
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,10,"This was the result of a director who not only painstakingly researched every aspect of colonial life in the 1630s, but who also executed his ideas with striking confidence. The aspects of the film (lighting, sound, dialog, pacing, composition) created an atmosphere so real I was no longer sitting on my couch watching, but rather living this inherited puritan nightmare.The movie's controlling idea is simple: The prevailing human desire to seek reassurance from a higher power can easily be twisted by ignorance, superstition, psychological insecurities and a horrendous misinterpretation of religion into a culture of self-flogging that nurtures guilt and fear until they become invincible beasts, then lets them lose on the mind to devour it whole. The result of this scary process is a flock of pariahs, known by the fancy, superstitious name of ""witches"" who live on the peripheries of society, devoid of any means of compassion, stripped of all sanity and civility, living in a world of morbid fantasies and diseased hallucinations in which they are left defenseless to their auto-cannibalistic minds that devour their sanity.The performances were also pitch perfect and very believable for the characters the actors played and, although this might prove hard to get by for some, they speak in period-authentic language/accents. Ultimately, the film is rather ambiguous as to whether or not the events occur in the manner you see them, but that's the beauty of it: like religion itself, THE WITCH is open to interpretation. And as such, it establishes itself (in my opinion) as one of the best horror films of the last 10 years.The Witch to me, is a brilliantly shot (natural lighting and using a different aspect ratio to get the sense of isolation), well acted and fascinatingly told. It is a simple story that leaves a big impact, if you are looking for an eerie, haunting film that will make you think."
" for a horror movie it's 4/10
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,7,"It's very difficult movie to rate.
I wanted to give it 5/10 but I couldn't
here is why:great cinematography
great sound
great acting
great music
great depiction of the 17th century atmosphere especially the (religion,language) aspect
however, the story is simply just not as good."
" A Wonderful Movie
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,9,"A remarkable story.A typical Hollywood gore film ? Not all.A real horror story of a family that encounters an evil spirit.If you are looking for blood and guts and not much else, skip this movie as it will be over your head."
" Seminal film in the history of the horror genre
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,10,"Having seen this film several times since its initial release in the theater, the feelings evoked here continue to resonate with me and so many fans of the horror genre. The Witch, in my opinion, is an achievement that has set the pace on several fronts:1. Horror that creates a sense of slow-burn unease, spiked by occasional moments of shock. This is a shift from the previously-omnipresent jump scare nature of this genre.
2. Horror that is historically-based, well researched, and thus is even ""educational"" viewing.
3. Horror that is actor-centric, while still clearly being atmospheric.
4. Perhaps the greatest achievement of his master-work, The Witch, was the ability to create and develop characters from centuries ago with dilemmas which resonate today.Kudos to Robert Eggers on his freshman effort, capturing the attention of many actors who now strive to work with this humble auteur of the art of film-making. Because of his recent work, and that of other young directors, I believe the future of horror is in good hands."
" Weird Movie
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,6,"I expected much more from this movie honestly , many things didnt really add up or make sense , and at some point it was just meaningless screams and all that stuff. The Plot wasnt really terrible but i mean the movie is supposed to have a witch in it and we see her like one time . In general , this movie isnt really that scary and the ending is kind dumb and i dunno if this movie was really worth watching at all. Recommended for anyone having nothing better to watch ,mediocre movie."
" Everything I want from a psychological horror
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,"Beautifully shot, strong performances, great editing, satisfying ending. If you're on the fence, just watch it; It's only an hour and a half and is sure to scare you at the very least."
" Masterfully crafted, wholly original, profoundly moving and utterly terrifying
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,"This is truly the greatest horror film of the 21st century. It is a period piece that is extraordinarily authentic, yet the attention to detail only adds to the dark atmosphere rather than distracting. The story feels like an eclectic blend of the dark strange atmosphere of ""The Shining"" and the drama of ""The Crucible"". Robert Eggers displays a powerhouse of technical filmmaking precision and masterful writing. The actors are incredible and the music is unforgettable. The story is biblical, horrifying, and devastating. This film is not for everyone; some may find the dialogue boring, but the attentive viewer will find it only adds to the hypnotic atmosphere. If you appreciate deep characters, story, and cinema as an art, you will love this film. I remember being so shaken by the ending that I couldn't breathe, and this will forever be one of my favorite horror films. 10/10"
" A masterpiece by all means
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,10,"The plot , the setting, the acting, the cinematography, the direction, the horror ... this is probably one of the most underrated movies of all times , a masterpiece and a horror classic by all means"
" Excellent. Tense. Not a horror
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,8,Stunning acting. Constant mood of threat. Period detail spot on.People going on and on about it not having enough horror are way off bat. This is about religious fanaticism. Blind faith.The only annoying part was the mumbled dialogue throughout making it impossible to understand.Thought provoking. Disturbing.
" A Piece of crap.
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,1,I don't understand the attraction to this movie. I feel that it was a total waste of time. Maybe religious people like it so that they can pretend that there is a devil.
" If you like the usual horror blood and guts trope, this movie isn't for you
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie is absolutely amazing. The acting is great, the story is captivating. I normally don't write reviews but I had to for this one. All the hate comes from the fact this is a smart psychological horror. It doesn't have the cheap jump scares, lots of blood and action like most horror genre have. This is more if a folk tale told over the centuries by a Puritan point of view on the supernatural had come to life. I absolutely love horror movies and if Freddy Kruger or Jason is your only idea of horror, this movie isn't for you. But if you like a truly interesting story telling over cheap blood and gore, I highly recommend watching this film."
" A different genre
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,8,"Slowly builds up, with just the right atmosphere, towards an unsettling finale.Successful characterization, giving the feel of the age the story is in. Makes you immersed in the story.This is in the same avenue as Hereditary and Midsommar. May not be some people's cup of tea, which is totally understandable.A good work, worth a watch."
" Well, one version of the actual witch is ... hot; the rest of film ...
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,6,"This film is perhaps unlike any other film I have seen. Yes, there is horror, but it is not the type of horror that might cause your girlfriend to cuddle closer. It's creepy; VERY creepy.The acting is superb; I actually tuned in to see another film with Anya Taylor-Joy after watching ""The New Mutants"", but alas, she is only about 20yrs old or so for this film --- younger than I prefer. But she IS a very lovely young woman.This film might have scored higher for me if I could have understood more than about 1/3 of the dialog -- much of it, I""m sure, may be Period-Accurate; but to me, unintelligible. Hence my lowish rating.Again this film is quite creepy. Set yourself up for a level of creepy that you may not have seen before; but you may enjoy the film as I did."
" Not for Everyone
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"""The Witch"" is the directorial debut from Robert Eggers and is about a series of unfortunate events plaguing a family after they choose to depart from their village. ""The Witch"" stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie. Now this was a film I was quite looking forward to as I am a huge horror movie geek and I had heard nothing but positive things about the film. Now I must say this was probably my favourite film I have seen so far this year, however it is not for everyone. Just everything about this film I thought was incredible, just on a technical stand point the cinematography in this film was a sight to see and adds so much to this enthralling story which you can so easily get lost in. This movie was very interesting for the fact that it takes place in the 1630's and includes a mix of shakespearian and modern english dialogue which could have went one of two ways, either it'll sound really forced coming from the actors or they'll sound completely genuine and the audience will totally buy into the schtick. Luckily this is a case of all the actors being completely stellar and strong enough to deliver these performances that were shown in this movie, I did not think there was one flat performance and even when one of the actors seemed to falter he really won me back with a deeply disturbing scene where he just lets loose. Now like I was saying this movie will not be for everybody, many people will go into this expecting a horror film similar to many of the mainstream horror movies released nowadays and they will be thoroughly disappointed as ""The Witch"" is not one of those films flushed out with a bunch of jumpscares. This is a methodical film that takes its time to build itself up and some people may not be used to that and I am here to to tell you today that even though this film advertises seeing the witch itself, you actually see the witch less in this movie than you do the babadook in ""The Babadook"", this is not meant as a spoiler but more of a warning. So ""The Witch"" was a deeply suspenseful film that affected me on many levels, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen through the whole runtime, the score for this film was another profound aspect, I absolutely loved the way the it built up. Though I had slight problems with the film such as the strong english accents being hard to understand sometimes and colour palette being too grey at times, they didn't detract away from the film, for that reason ""The Witch"" receives a 10/10."
" Please don't watch.
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,It was slow and boring and lead up to nothing. And they speak old English. Just dreadful.
" Ok.
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,5,This movie seems to feature highly in the modern horror movie recommendations online.Don't know what all the fuss is about and I'm not quite sure what to make of it.I'm not sure this is what I would call horror or particularly good for that matter.Just ok really.

",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"So. Yeah. This was the stupidest movie ever. I don't care what category they add it under, it sucked. A more exciting movie would be watching someone smash their head into a wall for two hours. Literally though; who? Who are you people who gave this a good review? And what exactly are you on? 😂 42 y/o female - NJ USA."
" Damn the movie felt wrong
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,9,"Its not exactly horror, but it will definitely make you terrified, A must watch if you want to see something different."
" Witch history
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,8,"Seeing that this movie takes into account for a few stories of witches is good. I love this time period of early American colonial period. The imagery of the black goat and the young children love for role play as witches makes you wonder if they had communication with the devil. I loved Anya and Ralph's characters ( and Ralph's voice). Thomasin is being accused as being the witch, which we find who is later. The Witch overall is a great movie."
" Lame
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,1,"This movie TOTALLY SUCKED!! Do not waste your time, seriously"
" Its heart lies in the right place...
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,7,"As someone who avoids watching horror movies in general, I didn't really know what to expect other than it being a slow-burner. The movie establishes clearly in its first quarter that the horror is not merely psychological, but tries to make you believe in its universe of witchcraft.Till its climax, I was expecting some sort of logical explanation to the events being depicted but it hit me in the final moments the kind of horror which the makers wanted to depict.I especially loved the performances by the child actors and get the polarising reviews it might get because it is certainly not a movie for everyone."
" Not as scary as I thought it'd be.
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,8,"Not to say scary is better, but this movie left a shorter impression on me than Robert Eggers' other film, The Lighthouse, which is one of my favourite films of all time.
The acting, dialogue, and music were all great in this film. However, at least upon my first viewing, I don't see many themes or overarching morals/ideas as I do in The Lighthouse.
Something interesting I noticed is that it shares a lot of parallels with Midsommar, but with many aspects flipped. Instead of being indoctrinated, they're exiled. Instead of it being eternal day during summer, most of the horror takes place at night in winter. Instead of the evil coming from within the group, it's an external threat. Instead of beautiful visuals, it's drab and unsaturated.
The VVitch also reminded me a lot of Hereditary, mostly in story arch and the ending. However, I know The VVitch came out before both of these films, so perhaps they took inspiration from The VVitch.
This is still a solid movie though, and was unnerving in several parts, but seeing The Lighthouse first may have skewed my expectations a bit too high.
If you like this movie, I couldn't recommend Midsommar or Hereditary enough."
" Slow, bleak, disturbing. One to avoid.
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,3,"I wanted to write this to provide a counter to some of the rave reviews I saw here. In summary, the film is slow, disturbing and frankly irritating. I would avoid unless you've got a taste for slow, bleak, artsy films.In my opinion, the plot was near enough non-existent. Basically it tells a story of a deeply pious family being torn apart by outside forces. Sounds alright, but in execution it amounts to actors reciting long drama school type scripts (in difficult to understand old English) interspersed with long bleak shots of not much and the odd quite disturbing scene.At times the overbearing sound track (lots of screechy violin!), crying, wailing and carping on was actually just plain annoying.I don't think this would be to the taste if your average film lover. I'd only recommend it if you like a film that makes you uncomfortable."
" Made for a particular audience...
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,4,"This movie will be loved by cinephiles but less so by the average moviegoer. This New-England folktale has a slow, moody build with a poor payoff. They do a good job of staying true to the puritan history, language, costumes, and settings. The acting is decent from the older cast, especially the eldest daughter and father but the youngest cast (acting and script) almost takes away from the cleverness of the film. There are no real scares except for the intense build and creepiness of it all but, the ending was a huge letdown for me and ruined the whole film. There are some artistic and creative moments for this film but all-in-all I wouldn't recommend this movie to the average horror/thriller audience, more for a film buff/movie critic In My Humble Opinion. 10/2020"

" does a whole lot with just a little
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,10,"This is a prime example of solid filmmaking. transporting us seamlessly back in time to the colonial era, when even a small mistake can end in life-canceling tragedy, the Witch takes the basic fears of being human and manifests them in the form of a devil Goat. The witch plays on the ubiquitous fear of the unknown. How well do we know our family, ourselves? The effects in the movie are minimal and make that much more of an impact when we see them. The ending sequence alone is worth the 10 star rating. This is a must-see for all horror, suspense, historical and general film fans!"
" Terrifying
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,10,One of the best horror movies I've ever seen. So well-made. I love this movie so much that it has become an annual Halloween tradition. It's nerve-wracking and intense.
" Long, boring
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,2,"How this got any good ratings is beyond me. The acting is fine. The movie isn't. This could boil down to an episode of some horror anthology, and STILL bore its audience. Definitely NOT a movie that I would recommend. It just made me glad I didn't live in those times!"
" Worth the drag
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,8,"Watching with subtitles definitely helps. The movie is pretty long and draggy, but the payoff is worth the wait."
" Disappointing
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,6,"Half way through I realized it was slowly building... to nothing. The ending was beyond disappointing, most obvious and meaningless. And what's up with audio being so bad? Could not hear anything being said, yet the noises were so loud, made it even harder to enjoy.All that while I love witches, the colonies, indie horror and even Eggers' second movie the lighthouse."
" Awfully boring
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,1,NOT A HORROR MOVIE. IT WAS JUST ABOUT A FAMILY IN THE 1600S LIVING OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE AND GOING MAD RELIGIOUSLY. oh yeah and a there's a goat dabbling in the black arts. STUPID!!
" A slow burn that gets stoked
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,2,"I give credit where credit is do, the film does create a intense and creepy atmosphere. The actors do a good job. But the movie is slow and boring. And the whole time your waiting for the unveiling of something brilliant. It never happens. It's a huge disappointment..."
" Boring!
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,1,"I was hoping for something better than what this was. Bored beyond belief, extremely slow story telling, tries too hard to be suspenseful. I didn't give up on it and now wish I wouldn't have bothered watching."
" Surprisingly good; completely unexpected.
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,9,"I was ready to hate this movie, as I was expecting the standard, vicious assault on Christianity by hard-Left Hollywood that has sadly become the norm . I gave it a try anyway, and I'm so glad that I did. Although I needed to turn on the subtitles to grasp much of the dialogue, this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film at all. It's a beautifully-crafted film & very well-acted. Excellent casting and it features a magnificent attention to detail. It's a film that I'll definitely be wanting to see again, which is VERY rare these days. Not for children or those with short attention spans, but patient, thoughtful adults who have at least a minimal understanding of history should enjoy this rare gem."
" What?
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,5,"Can you understand ANYTHING they are saying? Low voices, too quiet or just an accent that is way too much. Sorry, too much for me."
" Will keep you guessing till the end....
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,7,"I've read many reviews here and have decided the people who give it 1 star don't understand the history of Puritanism and the Salem witch trials and satanism. Whether you'll enjoy this depends on whether you know this history and what your expectations are from ""horror"" movies.If you don't know the history, you'll likely find the ""possession/symbolism"" of animals and the constant focus of everyday life as related to ""God"",ie; ...is what I'm or others doing consistent with God's will and word and if it's not...it's the work of Satan, as ridiculous and overstated/acted. For those who know the history, the Witch is a very emotional slide into what can happen to the average human when every action and word is weighed as of God or Satan. The horror comes slowly and is wrapped up in the question of is there really a witch/Satan running the show here or is it just insanity or are they one in the same. Even in the final scene I questioned whether everything was really happening or was it just in Thomasin's mind. Puritans truly believed in Satan's power and interference in daily life. Things such as crop failure, illness, even moles on a body were taken as signs of the devil so it is easy to understand how a young girl who just witnessed the death of her family but wanted to be ""free"" would in shock, bring all her beliefs into one final delusion....or did she. I love walking in the woods but after this movie, I expect to be a bit jittery and probably won't do it alone!"
" Very scary at the end
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,7,"This movie takes a while to get going, but is very scary in the ending. Would recommend to those who enjoy the story over getting jump scared all the time."
" Amazing
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,10,"This was disgusting, horrifying and ghastly as it should be.
Loved it👌"
" Is boring a new film genre?
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,3,"This movie was just plain boring. This is the kind of movie people will say is magnificent, is a tour de force of film making, blah blah blah. The same kind of people who tell you movies like ""The Babadook"" and ""Hereditary"" are also excellent films. The kind of movie that your fem. lit. teacher will tell you to watch as she/zhe/zhir/whatever goes on and on about systems of oppression and how witches were the first real feminists. Unfortunately, even science and engineering majors have to take garbage courses like fem. lit.It made a good attempt at trying to be authentic in terms of setting, and it has a gritty dirty feel. No comforts at all.It's not scary. It doesn't make you think about religion and supernatural forces anymore than watching ""Ancient Aliens"". And at least with ""Ancient Aliens"", the sound editing is better, this movie has moments when the actors are hardly understandable."
" Easily one of the worst films I've ever seen
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,1,"I don't know what some reviewers have been smoking, but this film doesn't deserve anything above a 1. Nothing happens at all. I genuinely would rather sit on the toilet with severe diarrhoea then watch this again. Please believe me. Don't waste your time. 1/10"
" Slow-burning adult horror story sculpted around actual historical supernatural beliefs
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,10,"Horror isn't my favorite genre, but I like to dip into it periodically. I'm coming off of losing 2 hours of my life to a rather ordinary yet over-rated zombie flick (specifically, ""Train to Busan""), so there's a good chance that I'm tacking an extra star on presently because this exceptionally well-crafted, high-quality production is catching me on the rebound.""The Witch"" isn't a conventional modern horror film and will leave those yearning for jump-scares, screams, and over-flowing guts wanting much more probably. It also builds slowly and feels longer than its runtime, although this is one of the rare cases when that isn't a bad thing. Still, most younger audience members will probably be reaching for their phones soon. In addition, the ""Olde English"" the characters use takes some getting used to and almost requires subtitles at times, or at least it did for me. On the other hand, like Shakespeare, you really don't have to get every word or phrase to easily follow the story. As is mentioned at the end, the plot was crafted around actual medieval witchcraft folklore and trials. Therefore, if you're familiar with that history, as the story progresses, you vaguely feel that you know where its all going. Personally, this film felt like it was ripped straight from my own personal cultural DNA, being that I'm one of those particularly loathsome creatures, in other words, an aging, well-educated, western, white male.This movie really got under my skin as it went along and effectively erased the prior cinematic misfire, for which I'm very grateful. Zombies may have run their course with me. ""The Witch"" is time very well spent, even if you don't carry my particular cultural baggage. It's probably too slow and inadequately bloody for many or most of today's horror aficionados, but it works great as adult horror entertainment which sneaks in legitimate education about ""olde-tyme"", western, witchcraft beliefs. A win-win, as I see it and maybe for you too."
" Henceforth. Thou shall live Delicious.
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,9,"Horrorfilm of 2016... You bet your sweet derriere. Writer-director Robert Eggers' viciously delicious slowburner represents all that's good about low-budget terror.Shunning his religious community, patriarch William and his family take to the wilderness to try and start anew.
Misfortune however, seems to plagued the venture at every turn, not only does the crop keep failing but their infant son disappears, seemingly gobbled up by the ominous woods looming large over the family' habitat.
As conditions worsen, the family unit begins to self-destruct, all under the watchful eye of the households malevolent billy goat Black Phillip.Making rumbles since its debut at Sundance 2015, The Witch has been long awaited by yours truly. Did it live up to expectations? Did it ever!
The Witch is an amazingly taut and focused horror movie.
Debutant Eggers has an iron tight grip on proceedings and shows no qualms about how he's going to go about telling his story. The script, cinematography, acting and score, all of the highest order, effortlessly amalgamates into one hell of an unsettling and disturbing horror experience.
Best of all, he manages all of this without pandering to the lowest common denominator, instead trusting the audience to find their own way in getting his point across.Last but certainly not least, special props must go to the amazing creation that is Black Phillip, a 210-pound billy goat named Charlie, who apparently ran roughshod over the cast and crew during production. Well I'm here tell you that their trails and pain was worth it as Phillip (short as his appearance may be) will no doubt join the annals of horror lore as one of the greatest animal performers ever, so effective is his performance in the film.
As a matter of fact, He might as well rise onto his hind legs - now rather the later - and violently bang his majestic horns at the endless night sky, bellowing out in celebration as he and his fellows have just crafted one of the greatest horror offerings of the 21th century.Baaaaaaaaaa!!! Indeed."
" One of the most effective horrors of all time
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,8,"Why did I make the decision to watch this movie on a dark, stormy night(that's a cliche I'm aware)? This movie is a slow burn horror movie with some disturbing visual and eerie feeling throughout. I am not going to list actors and how brilliant they were because every actor shone in this film even the child actors. The production of this films is one of my favorites as it was almost all done practically. The dialogue and it's use of Old English is amazing and proves Eggers is a master of his craft despite it being his first role directing. The use of sound in this film is my new favorite for a horror movie with its use of chants and silence. The light from candle and the darkness really add to the eeriness. I can not praise Eggers enough for this as it was his first movie he ever directed and makes me want to see his new movie The Lighthouse even more. The film is probably the scariest horror movie I have ever seen(it might have been where and when I watched it but I do not believe this is true). I highly recommend this film for a constant suspense and scares. It's well worth checking out on Netflix.Also I love that the film does not rely on cheap jump scares which ruin films upon rewatch. I feel if I watched the film again then it would have the same eeriness."
" Not your typical ""horror"" film...this is MUCH BETTER
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,9,"I am not a fan of horror films, but I do recommend watching this film. This is not a typical horror film; I describe it as a psychological thriller about witch-craft and devil worshiping beliefs of the 1600's. There is a constant state of wonder about who is the ""witch"" or evil one? Watch it because it is a well-crafted story.The cinematography really brings it to life. The setting looks very authentic and the low lighting reminds you that you are watching a film before electricity. Watch it because the cinematography will take you back in time.The acting is superb! Many young actors and I cannot say enough about their performance. They all did a great job with the Colonial language and mannerisms. The young man who played ""Caleb"" (Harvey Scrimshaw) deserves to be in more films, as he was outstanding. The young lady playing ""Mercy"" (Ellie Grainger) was scary for such a young actor and Anya Taylor-Joy was both innocent and frightening in her role as Thomasin. Watch it because the acting is excellent."
" Nothing special
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,4,"I watched this film after watching same director's other movie ""The Lighthouse"". This film was nothing but a slow family drama questioning their belief in God and descending into madness.
Talking of acting, it was not upto the mark but you spend the movie waiting for a big finale which does not happen. The story was simple, nothing special. Overall, would say that it will be better for you to watch same director's other work ""The Lighthouse"" which was much better than this."
" Wth...
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,4,"I honestly don't know what I just watched...
I was looking for a good scary movie to watch on a date, and this movie was not helpful. I don't think there was a single scary scene, maybe one... but the entire movie is just slow.
I read the other reviews and I see that most people like it, but I just don't understand how, it's slow and not scary. The acting and cinematography was good, but this is not what I would consider a good movie. Very forgettable..."
" Hard to watch
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,3,The movie seems like it would be decent. Sorry is ok. Acting is fair.The huge problem is the poor job done in post production. The music and sound effects are way too loud and overbearing. I found myself constantly turning up the volume just to hear the muffled dialogue and then the very next minute there was screeching music that was near deafening.It doesn't really suck one in when they have to sit there with the remote constantly adjusting the volume. it's pretty annoying in ruined the whole movie experience.
" ""Wouldst thou like to see the world?""
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,8,"Wow, this movie is really good.I watched this movie last night and went in with no knowledge or expectations and went to bed unable to stop thinking about it... The user rating is completely misleading, and I can definitely see this movie being mentioned among the classics maybe 20 years from now.This film shows an accurate portrait of ""if a devil chose to haunt a peasant family, this is how it would've happened""--There were no crazy make-ups, top notch CGI effects, the goat transforming into Lucifer with cheesy noises. They kept it as natural as they could. Even when the goat spoke to Thomasin, they kept the camera on the girl, because it was the audience's choice whether he spoke telepathically, or with his goat mouth and then him appearing behind the girl in complete darkness, showing nothing but only enough parts so the audience knew he was no longer an animal. (Side Note that was by far my favorite scene in the movie).Now, I can kinda understand why some didn't really enjoy this movie. I get that some watch a movie for entertainment and to pass the time, but some of us look at a movie like they would a painting. Looking for subtle messages everywhere. So I can sympathize a bit with why some people found the movie boring, because the pace was definitely slow. However, I personally found the slow pace of the story to be perfectly appropriate. I really liked the slow buildup to the end.I'm pretty sure keeping the audience's adrenaline high wasn't their main goal. There were scenes that you had to pay attention to if you wanted to know what the hell was going on. For example: Black Phillip knew the exact buttons to push to seduce everyone. The mother wanted to see her children, and he had them appear to her, making her read a book that was likely demonic. Caleb was going through puberty, and he was full of lust. So, a beautiful woman appeared that Caleb could not resist. The father, on the other hand, was impenetrable. He wanted nothing but forgiveness from God, so Black Phillip straight out killed him.Despite its slow pace (which i thoroughly enjoyed), the movie made its point very clear. And the point was how attractive the devil's side could be in some cases--actually, not in some cases but in any case. Even the audience is forced to sympathize with the girl at the end, for ""choosing the dark side."" Because God did nothing in return of the entire family's prayers. Her whole family was murdered by Lucifer, and even if she didn't go to meet Black Phillip, stayed in the house and did her prayers, what would change?I guess the thing I love most about this movie is it truly feels like real folklore people would have passed down the generations. ""Don't be like that family, don't leave the warm embrace of the tribe or you'll end up being corrupted by the devil"" and so forth...I'd say ""The Witch"" is more of a ""film"" than a movie...it has loads of artistic value. Like any quality ""film"" this isn't made to appeal to the masses. It is what it is and it does it extremely well. This is a film i'd definitely recommend to others who enjoy well made period pieces.

" Terrible!
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,1,Don't waste your time with this load of rubbish. It's not a horror film it wouldn't scare a five year old. How on Earth anyone can rate this movie above 3 or 4 is beyond me.
" ""You cannot escape the woods.""
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,"The film delivers psychological horror by virtue of suggestion, which in a lot of cases can be much more frightening than the real thing. If one disregards supernatural elements at work, the picture offers a study of a 1630's era family about to experience dysfunction at a most catastrophic level. By holding a faith in God as their only rationale to exist, virtually every moment in the life of William (Ralph Ineson) and wife Katherine (Kate Dickie) offers an occasion for sin. Their concern for their children is claustrophobic, which eventually leads the siblings to turn on each other via accusations of conspiring with the devil and witches. What catapults the story into the realm of horror is the sudden, and I would consider, almost impossible disappearance of baby Samuel, who's departure from sister Thomasin's ( Anya Taylor-Joy) watchful gaze occurs so instantaneously that one would have to question what mechanism could have been so responsible. The story builds from there as events spiral into a frenzy of grievous misunderstandings and accusations, until Thomasin becomes the only survivor of a demonic evil that alternately takes form in that of a red haired witch, a hideous old hag and a bad tempered goat named Black Phillip. Alternatively, one might, by virtue of the film's closing moments, determine that the destruction perpetrated on the banished wilderness family was caused by a demonic cult practicing their black magic in the deep cover of the family farm's neighboring woods. Though it wouldn't explain Thomasin's levitation above the forest in what has to be considered one of the most abrupt endings you're likely to experience in a film of this kind."
" I don't know why
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,9,"I don't know why I love this film so much.
I've watched 4 times as of this review and I know I'll watch it again. It's beautiful in its simplicity and horrifying in its intent. Love it.
Just give it a chance and let the movie move you not what you think it should do. Then you'll enjoy it as I do."
" Garbage!
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,1,Waste of time! It's not horror at all. Writen by a sick mind!
" Worst Horror Movie Ever
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,1,"Not only it was not scary it was also one of the most boring movies I have ever watched. Bad directing, bad writing, terrible storytelling. How does this movie has such a good rating and reviews?"
" Classic New England Folklore to Give You the Heebie Jeebies
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,8,Eggers hits the ground running with this eerie film. The characters are dealing with the uncertainty of living in 1600s New England alongside the terrors of the unknown creatures that lurk between our realm and the realm of the dead
" More the tale of a family going to ruins than horror
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,8,"But a good movie nonetheless, if not for the fact that is the debut of my secret crush Anya Taylor-Joy (Anya I deeply, truly love you). Just don't believe those people making connections between this movie and the timeless masterpiece Kanashimi No Belladonna because the subject of this one is the one told in the title of the review, not feminism nor women's struggle against oppressive patriarcal institutions and religions neither freedom of sexuality and search for sexual happiness."
" Dark and well done
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,7,"A quiet, dark movie that leaves the viewer thinking about the interplay between fraying psychology, reality, and the supernatural. In this regard it reminds me of The Shining. The set and costuming is very well done and seems historically accurate, at least for an average audience member, and the actors pull you into their colonial world. Recommended."
" Really impressed
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,10,"This is a really good horror movie, it had scenes that were really hard to watch. Everyone was amazing in it. I had the feeling that in almost every scene they could show what they can do as an actor/actress. I had no problem with the length. The costume design was pretty amazing too, it felt like 17th century.
I was really impressed by this movie and I think its better than the Lighthouse"
" Excellent
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,10,Loved this movie. The best horror movies don't rely on blood and guts but suspense and atmosphere. This one's for it.
" The evil that lives within us all
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,8,"The Witch is a movie about a small family that lives in 17th century New England. They're far removed from their nearest community, all alone on their farm. Hard-working, religious and fervent in their world views. So what would happen if they started fearing that the Devil himself had infected one of their own?The film is the feature directional debut of Robert Eggers, who's worked in theater before this one, mainly as a production designer. And that definitely shows. The attention to detail in this film is astonishing. Everything from the location to the set designs to the costumes is about as period accurate as possible. Even the dialogue and the accents utilized by the actors is straight from 1630s Plymouth Colony. The only way to make this more accurate would be to invent a time machine and actually film in the 1600s.As for the horror aspect of the story, it works very well. The film is in no hurry and doesn't rely on cheap jump scares to get you to sit on the edge of your seat. Rather it relies on atmosphere and good character building. Its characters are fearful, frail and flawed. And when the pressure is put on them, they turn on one another. If jump scares are being shanked with a knife, then this film would be the slow agony of a screw press. And when the violence inevitably comes, it's all the more horrifying because you've been waiting for it for so long.Easily one of the best horror films I've seen in years. Also one of the best period films I've seen in years. Heartily recommended."
" Creepy World / Ok Story 7/10
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,7,"Story - 5/10 pros: it's an interesting concept and a nice setup for a horror movie. Wonderful time period to explore the seclusion and danger of religion. It just moved way too slow for me. cons: The filmmakers capture a wonderful eerie feel to this film, but rely to heavily on it to continue the audience through a slightly uneventful tale.Cast - 10/10 pros: Anya Taylor-Joy is mesmerizing. Without her I think this film could have fallen apart. Ineson and Dickie provide some truly disturbing performances along side her. cons: nothing to list here, this is one of the major strengths of this filmDirection - 8/10 pros: Eggers captures an unbelievable feel of despair and solitaire, reminiscence to Kubrick's work in the Shining. He is not afraid to take his time to create this sense of feeling. cons: possible he relied on superior filmmaking and didn't focus on story as much.Pace - 6/10 pros/cons: this is a tough one so listing pros and cons together here. This is a slow moving movie, a very slow moving movie, it can be tough to sit through, but at the same time that is one of it's major strengths; it's ability to make the audience squirm.Atmosphere - 10/10 pros: the remote farm looks beautiful. the soft hazy overcast days provide a perfect look for a tale that is just as scary in daylight as it is in the dead of night. This is the brilliance of this film, every day life is just as horrifying as a monster in the woods. The look of this film is top notch. Every shot appears perfectly planned. The costumes blend into the desolate gray of the rest of the world and provide a perfect topper to the sadness of this life. The makeup and blood work is truly disturbing. cons: again the atmosphere and cast are truly special in this film.Overall 7/10 this could have been an all-time classic but story lacked just a bit, still a very great film."
" Surprise to be sure, but welcome one
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,9,"To be honest, I expected something truly different. This film shows you 7 members of one family expelled from community. Portrayals of characters are only as deep as you can get in 93 minutes, yet interesting enough to impress you. There is nothing special to catch to, yet it keeps your mind occupied throughout whole film. It avoid almost all disgusting bloodbath or scary death scenes, yet it has its own atmosphere. This work is outstanding between movies of its kind and all the horror movies. Big thumb up for Anya and for the ending!"
" Unconventional but very effective horror film
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,8,"This is my second review I'm posting for this film. My original review from 4 years ago was a long winded comparison between this and Rosemary's Baby. The films do share many similarities I'll get into later, but don't think about that going into the movie.This paragraph is my spoiler-free review, and everything after that will be more in-depth. All I'm going to say is The Witch is the last horror film I ever saw that legitimately scared me. I've seen a lot of horror movies, and its not like I was a kid when I watched this either. This movie came out when I was 20, it still unsettled me to the point where I had trouble falling asleep for the next 2 nights. No movie has done that to me since. I even saw it in the theater twice. It takes a lot for me to see a movie in the theater twice. I think the reason it affected me so much is because its a very unconventional horror film. After seeing so many scary movies, you get an idea of the formula. Chris Stuckmann said it best when he described The Witch as ""almost perversely designed to make you feel uneasy"". When I first watched the film, there were several points where I expected something to happen, and instead of that thing happening, it would do something else, and that thing was always way more disturbing than what I imagined. The isolation and tension the supernatural happenings drive into the family's life adds another layer of conflict, and it works very well. The 1.66:1 aspect ratio makes the protagonists feel small and the trees imposing and ominous. The score of slow strings and choirs creates a haunting, monolithic soundscape. The atmosphere is so effective, even in a scene where you can tell the sun's going down, you're put on edge in anticipation of what might happen at night. If the mere time of day in a film can instill suspense, that's good tension building if I've ever seen it. Overall the acting is strong, but the actors who played William and Thomasin were the real standouts. The young twins were annoying, but I think they were supposed to be.Most of my problems with the film are minor, but the elephant in the room for me was how similar it is to Rosemary's Baby. The dominant male figure in our female protagonist's life seeking professional or spiritual fulfillment is the reason they're in a new environment in the first place. They are isolated (socially in Rosemary's Baby, physically in The Witch). In both endings, the female protagonist joins a coven due to their waning faith and because they are left with nowhere left to go. Their respective decisions to join a coven takes them from the submissive female roles of their respective cultures to positions of relative power, albeit in a perverse way.I love both these movies, but Rosemary's Baby is undeniably the stronger film. The Witch is a great movie, but if you didn't like it, I would recommend Rosemary's Baby since its a similar premise but more timeless and overall better crafted. It's an amazing first film nevertheless. Since the release of The Lighthouse, Robert Eggers is quickly becoming on of my favorite directors, and I eagerly anticipate his future projects."
" terrible movie
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,1,"It really takes a lot for me to give such a bad review on a movie, I'm usually sympathetic and don't like giving poor reviews, but, sorry as I may be, I just can't see anything in this movie, poor acting, no real plot, they try to make it a dark movie, but just making the picture continually going dark doesn't do the trick. I just see nothing in this movie, sorry."
" Quick review
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,"I watched The Witch and I thought it was alright. The acting is pretty great and the child actors were just as good as the adults. The cinematography is great as well, but some of the shots are ruined by bad CGI, there's a shot where the smoke from the chimney is frozen still. The script is also pretty good and the use of the dialect of the time period was interesting and worked very will. That's what I liked. I thought the pacing was really bad and it made the movie boring when things that don't directly effect the plot were happening. Speaking of the plot I did not really like the direction the film went, it felt quite anti-climactic despite some really important things happening, I felt this way because I could see where the story was going as soon as the third act started. Finally something that is very important to me is music in and out of film, and the music is this film sucked, even worse than having bad music it was so inappropriately used that it genuinely ruined quite a few scenes for me. Having the main score absolutely Blair over a still shot of the forrest is so obnoxious.Overall I recommend The Witch if it's the type of movie you think you will enjoy, overwise you might not enjoy it."
" Authentic and fresh
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,I usually don't vibe with period films especially horror but this one was interesting right away. The costuming was believable and everything was very aesthetic. It was very much about what you weren't seeing without feeling like they were holding back on the blood. The dialogue seemed legit as far as time period but was still difficult to understand sometimes and the best part of the movie was the visual aspects.
" ""The Witch"" is for those who love historically accurate films, with a twist
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,8,"One of the first things that sparked my interest was: the music. This music is phenomenal, now because the movie has an excellent soundtrack, but because the movie uses the music as a way to push the story forward. Ominous music begins low and gets to a point where you scramble to turn the sound down for fear of waking anyone.The language used is very authentic and very believable for that period. It is also not hard to understand, but hard to hear, the music is louder than their voices, but never overlapping.The differences in this movie being the historic timing, is that there are actual witches in this story. This isn't something like ""The Village"", where fears are made from something nonexistent. This is what sets this movie from all of the others.I would recommend this movie is you like realistic witch stories within a historically correct setting.What makes this movie 'feel' more real is that the fears are not just irrational, they're eating your family."
" Witch Witch?

",2020-06-10 00:00:00,6,I am not too sure what we just watched. On one hand the puritan detailing was superb but I sort of lost the storyline somewhere and struggled to reconnect
" Disappointed
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,1,"Had high expectations, but could barely stay awake through this very slow-paced DRAMA. Not a horror movie!
Camera work was decent, acting was ok, but it was so freaking slow, that when something finally happens, it's at the end of the movie and too late to save itself from a 1-star rating.
With movies like The Witch & It Follows, they need to be relabeled as Drama & not Horror!"
" What the heck did I just watch?!?
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,4,"Ok,, the good.Acting - well done. All the characters within the family portrayed this era very well.
Cinematography - shot very well.That's about all I can say,,, I get that the movie was supposed to be about religious paranoia and whatnot (I'm a Christian btw,, and I try to keep in mind that Jesus has set me free from my chains,, not the 'I better not mess up' kinda thing),,, but I got lost in all the craziness.Overall,, didn't care for it."

" Hallowed be thy name
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"What worked:
the screenplay; even if we take away the horror part of the story, it's still a captivating movie. It's raw and brutal, and it's as real as it can get, even with or removing any supernatural aspect. The movie is filmed well and captures the mood of the time it is portrayingWhat did not work:
the language is traditional English and at parts get hard to understand the dialoguesthe movie can be misguided in a sense that there are not any thrills or adrenaline rush that drives the narration, it's the mood and the character development that works. So, if we are expecting the scary scenes and want to be scared, there are very few such scenes, disturbing maybe some.Final verdict:
Recommended"
" Scenes but no storyline
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,3,I finally watched The Witch. It is very slow and you feel like you're on the verge of something that never quite happens. None of the things in the movie really tie into one another. There is not arch and no resolve. It basically just ends.The video is well shot. Scenery is beautiful. Film color is nice but almost just completely gray and black. The background music does add a lot of suspense to scenes that don't deliver. Dialogue was proper and the acting was good.I feel like the story zig zagged without really any place to go. There was no point to any of it.I don't recommend it.

" Atmospheric, authentic and utterly terrifying
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,8,"""The VVitch: A New-England Folktale"" is a 2015 horror drama directed by Robert Eggers starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Ralph Ineson. I experienced it firsthand that the movies of independent label A24 are somewhat peculiar in their style and far away from being the mainstream friendly features that pleases every single moviegoer. As of today, it is still a hit or miss for me, as I dearly love a few titles, some being unexpected surprises, but on the other hand also got a few titles that just don't resonate with me at all. May it be the utterly underwhelming psychological horror hit ""Midsommar"", a surprisingly intriguing crime drama like ""Spring Breakers"" or an innovative coming of age drama such as ""Lady Bird"", my opinions about the films of this production company differ wildly. It is not only in my case, the most unconventional titles seem to divide the whole viewership in general, sometimes I hear two totally opposite thoughts on the same movie. In the case of this film, this theory proves to be correct and happens to be a fact even in my own social circle. My classmate, who recommended this film to me and brought it to my attention, considers this film to be one of the scariest films she has ever seen and deeply loves it, on the other hand I have got my own parents who both agree that this film is a big snoozefest and think it is one of the most overrated horror films of all time. So, it is obvious that I didn't quite know what I should be expecting. I just went in with an open mind, and I got to say, it was undoubtedly an unconventional film, but I personally took a liking to it. What mostly stood out was the sheer authenticity of the whole production. From the contemporary setting over the costumes that are true to the depicted time, it all looks breathtakingly original, as if the crew travelled back in time and filmed an actual Puritan family and how they deal with their lives, but the thing that gives it the rest is the archaic language used in this film. Fortunately, I covered Shakespearean English and antique speech in my advanced course back in high school and surprisingly understood everything that has been said (given the fact that it is a foreign language to me, it was somewhat pleasing that I remember most of my education) and I think that was a strange but great experience. But of course, it isn't only this what makes this film so great. As I already implied before, the film's main focus lies on religion and especially Christianity. In the beginning, protagonist Thomasin and her family part ways with the colony they inhabited and start a life on their own in the wilderness, but once they arrived there, some scary things happen around them. It is indeed a simple premise and I understand why many might be bored by this, especially when the film itself is an extreme slow burner and horror fans that need everything to be graphic or to jump right in their faces are at the wrong address. The dread only creeps in slowly and one of the biggest factors why this film works out so alarmingly well to me is that it keeps up this certain kind of ambiguity until the very end. The baby all suddenly disappears, the brother returns from the wood and is visibly sick and no one seems to have an answer to that, except for the assumption that witches are after the family and that the devil himself has cursed them. The thing is, of course the members of the family try to explain the strange incidents reasonably (at least to a certain degree) and even though the film keeps up with the ambiguity and leaves it up to the viewer to decide whether everything is happening due to natural causes or to supernatural powers, the narration rather tends to go with the first option and tries to stay on the realistic way, but without excluding the other option completely. That makes it so unsettling throughout, as I didn't know what to believe in. Of course, there were several scenes that obviously depicted witches and their wicked actions, but all of them had this weirdness to them that made them appear like dream sequences or figments. They even could have been a part of a big metaphor. If you see the family leaving the colony as some form of banishment from the Garden of Eden and the aftermath as the struggle of surviving beyond the walls of paradise, the following things could be explained reasonably. The baby died of illness that resulted from the lack of comfort and Caleb got sick as well after got lost on his last hunting trip and the vanishing of the twins at the end of the movie also falls in the same category. People and children back in the day died comparatively quickly and when they had no explanation for what is happening, they scapegoated someone, mostly women, and accused them of being a witches. From a today's point of view, it of course is rubbish, but in this unenlightened time the easiest solution was also the correct solution. That is why I also think that the witches that are depict in some scenes could also be just a visual metaphor for this procedure to underline this paranoia. No matter what theory you believe in, the film itself has an indisputably unnerving atmosphere that never once let go of me. There was this invisible threat that haunts the family and even as the viewer I could not tell what the actual danger was. The fact that the film has shown some shots of the bordering forest for a few seconds from time to time without any connection to the actual context of the previous or following scene made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Like, it wanted to show us something with this, wanted to make us see that probably wasn't there. But what if? Even if I was just the one who watched the film while sitting on his couch, the film absorbed me completely and made me feel like I was in the film - and I felt constantly watched by something ... or someone. I mean, there was nothing shown explicitly, but still. The fact that I live near a forest and get a direct glimpse into the dark woods when I look out of my bedroom window made it even worse to me. Seriously, this film consumed me completely. Aside from the horror aspect, the film also contained a serious family drama that was shaped by paranoia, enviousness, and suspicion. To be honest, considering it was a family, it more seemed like they all hated each other with all their heart rather than loving each other, but that was the comprehension of family at that time, I think. They were stricter and more merciless in bringing up their children. Apart from this, most of the film also wouldn't work without the performances of the lead actors. Taylor-Joy is stunning and unpredictable in her feature film debut and carries most of the tension with her inscrutable innocence, Ineson is great in his role as the preaching family patriarch with the distinct bass voice and also Dickie's acting as the worried and grieving mother had something chilling to it. Believe it or not, the film hasn't even reached its final form of terror until the shocking finale. After each member of the haunted family, except for Thomasin, has been killed this way or another, it turns out that the witches actually exist in the context of the film. While it has been already subtly creepy before, the revelation that everything that has been going on throughout the whole film was indeed a result from supernatural forces makes it utterly terrifying retrospectively. I mean, they were in fact haunted and constantly watched by the witches living in the wood, right next to them and that sent shivers down my spine. At a moment's notice it destroys the illusion that everything that has happened was due to natural causes and that shocked me profoundly. The fact that the devil himself has been amongst them the whole time shines a whole new light on the religious meaning behind the film and subliminally confirms that evil exists ... while God doesn't. I mean, in the beginning, Thomasin prays to God and asks for salvation from her and her family's sins, but who shows up in the end? Who answers? It is superb how the film that focuses on the Christianity of its protagonists eventually subliminally draws the atheistic conclusion that there is no God and only pure evil. This whole thesis is then wrapped up with the conversion of Thomasin, as the pious young woman then turns herself into a witch and ultimately leaves behind her faith. She has been accused of being a witch throughout and was innocent all the time, so this act is also one final expression of disobedience towards her parents and I think that rounds it up magnificently. Oh, and let's not forget about the text in the end credits that reveals that most of the depicted scenes are based on contemporary literature, actual events and that some parts of dialogue were taken directly from diaries, documents and papers from that time. That gave me the rest. All in all, this film profoundly surprised me and scared the hell out of me with its unnerving atmosphere and the merciless mind games it plays with the viewer. The ambiguity it builds up is ultimately destroyed and makes it even creepier afterwards. It is unconventional and not quite the fastest film in terms of narration, but it is intensively atmospheric, authentic and absolutely historically correct. It is an accurate portrait of a dark and moody time that knows to scare you with its source material and doesn't need to be graphic to achieve its goal. It is undeniably quiet but effective, with a magnificently supporting disturbing score and the fact that it is based on true tales and folklore makes it utterly terrifying. A special kind of horror film that I thoroughly liked. I think I am going to check out more A24 films now ...To be honest, it was very hard for me to find sleep after watching this ... especially with a dark forest nearby."
" The witch - cure to insomnia. Yawn..
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,2,"I was half asleep throughout the movie expect for the first 15 minutes. There was no horror, no tension, no fear, no nothing. It bored me to death like no other horror movie I have seen before. I only watched this because of the positive reviews in here but oh boy, have they been wrong. If you are a fan of horror, skip this and instead watch paint dry. I bet it would be more interesting.2 / 10 for the hot lead girl and the cinematography."

" This made my head hurt in not a good way
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,3,What were they thinking? THIS ISN'T SCARY AT ALL!Horror movies HAVE to be scary not filled with drama. Forget watching it.
" A visually impressive period piece ruined by its ending
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,2,"I am someone who loves all things Salem and Puritan witch trials. Based upon good reviews and internet buzz, I had high hopes for this film. Things I did like were the costuming, the setting and the period-specific language. However, I was distinctly unimpressed overall. Many people rave about this as a horror film, but while there were certainly bloody, gory scenes, I would categorize that more as ""disgusting"" rather than ""scary."" As for the story itself, I guess it was meant to be a psychological thriller, but that only works if your audience can actually follow the story. I was appreciated the period-specific speech but due to the fact that the sound quality was bad, I found myself resorting to subtitles to attempt to follow what was going on. Unfortunately, it seemed like the entire film was just multiple vignettes of increasingly chaotic happenings on an isolated farm strung together, and what TRULY disappointed me was the end. The fact that there actually ARE witches and a devil/demon causing all the mayhem in the end is a much worse plot twist than if we discovered that the supernatural aspect was all imaginary and that the family slaughtered each other over something that only existed in their minds. Now THAT would've been a truly scary ending!!"
" The Positive Reviews Are an Enigma
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,2,"This film has already been branded ""a horror film for cinephiles,"" which is a way for the so-called cinephiles to elevate themselves - in their own minds - to a status of mental superiority and diminishing those of us who, despite having an avid love for film, also have an aversion to the term.The Witch is nothing special. It's nothing enjoyable, nothing memorable, and nothing that's worth revisiting at any point in the future. What began as a promising movie missed the mark entirely. It's in the same vein as the 2020 film The Turning: it set up a concept that had potential, and completely blew it with the execution.This movie was so painfully boring that every passing minute felt like torture. This story could've been engaging and truly suspenseful but, by the time the movie decides to actually do something with itself, it's too late. An audience will lose investment in a film's plot and characters if nothing happens for an extended period of time, and this movie excelled at that, offering a story that, even in its non-horror-centric plot points, couldn't be even mildly entertaining enough to hold interest. This movie is best served as background noise, because ultimately it's not worth much else.To pick positives to point out about this film would be the beautiful cinematography, the decent acting and the costuming. It truly does look like a period piece, which would be extremely interesting were it not for the fact that the film is so bland and so unconcerned with keeping the attention of the audience that it's a chore to sit through. Catch this one if it's on TV, but it's not worth the price of admission to purchase or even rent.I can already feel the cinephiles preparing to descend upon this review and mark it ""not helpful"" for a conflicting opinion, which will only further showcase my point. This isn't some film for people of higher intelligence; it's a cure for insomnia and a lesson in the history of filmmaking failure."
" Not the usual horror
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,10,"Most horrors are about gore and violence of every sencond of the movie but this one is unique. It is a realistic movie of how it was back in the day. I love the main protagonist, who only comes out at the end Black Phillip, at the end where he speaks Thomasin with that voice and those lines. Brilliant. I love the story and the unique deaths, a man being stabbed by a goat who's actually something like Satan, or baby being made into PASTE it's horrifying but the gore is just everywhere to make the movie, no it builds up with tension and music, wow the sounds, so amazing.

" Pushing horror genre forward

But I found some of the other technical aspects to be lacking. Visually it was ""ok"" with a handful of striking scenes. Overall, it's an original film with an ambitious vision for the horror genre and a fantastically climatic and creepy ending!"
" A movie all about looking cool
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,1,"This movie has a stupid empty plot, it's just not good, or well thought out, original, or anything. Ontop of that,the acting is terrible. So the movie has bad acting, bad ideas, completely unoriginal, a waste of time, a cash grab. What it does have left, aesthetics, it does have a little, though not much memorable, a film barely that shouldn't have anymore time spentonit, a colossal waste of time. The lighthouse too, the writer tries writing like Shakespeare, though forgets the fact that the characters are human. He's a bad writer, and stupid, his films are bad. High schoolers speaking in Shakespeare accents have better ears than him."

" a great horror film (it is a fairytale horror) that deserves a way better rating. it ust has an author fingerprint and it doesn't want to be mainstream.
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"Imdb sometimes has ratings that don't mach with the film quality - sometimes they're too good for the film sometimes they're too bad. and the problem is about the expectation of the viewer. this film has something of art house in it, made by a guy that has a vision - it's not a standard horror film and should not be looked that way. people need to let the film flow and have expectations that can't be matched what they are accostumed to see - and while sometimes i understand, in other cases i won't. in reality this film deserves a rating around 7.6. in these case, critics are more trustworthy. why? Because they see a lot of films, and get tired easier from the same gimmicks than the movie goers. sometimes critics are unfair yes, but on other times the problem is there are a lot of reviews made by people that are not expecting that horror films can be like this.so yeah, if i was 16 years old and thought insidious was an awesome horror film i probably wouldn't like this one (i actually think insidious is good, but way more standarized than this - and my favor horror subgenre is by far slashers) because it's very different. this is almost author cinema made in the horror field. because yes this movie can be scary - mostly by what you don't see. by the music, by the ambiance around the forest, by the cinematography...even by the language they're talking.this is supposed to be a fairytale an horror tale that took place in the 17th century, a tale that you tell to young people to scary them amidst a campfire in the woods . this movie has all the elements of a traditional folktale and should be regarded as such. maintaining that speech was a very clever move, because it makes us travel easier back then, a time where pretty much people feared everything - and this family feels cursed right from the beggining. that fear is pretty much everywhere in the movie.and yet the horror elements prevail: the idea something ""is hiding"", the fact that ""everybody is a suspect"", or saying ""ill be back"" might cost you. it's a tale made with the horror rulebook on point that wants to follow it. just its own way. i liked the ending by the way, where i think the truth is explained. and i really enjoyed to follow the deep suspicions of this family around themselves while something terrifying might be hiding close to them.just please don't expect this movie to be a mainstream horror film. it's not. it has someone with a fingerprint, and only eggers could have done this, no one else. I have ""the lighthouse to still check and i'm going to do it after really enjoying this first film of his."
" Reading the reviews, I thought I had watched the wrong movie...
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,6,"... because the amount of 10/10 is very confusing to me. The overuse of the term ""Masterpiece"" as well. It is not a bad movie, the hour and a half went by fast, the cinematography is beautiful and the acting is good, but I must say I was expecting more intensity in the characters or in the plot. Not necessarily ""scary"" things or jumpscares, which I hate, but simply more depth. The witch character was intriguing and I wish we had seen more of her. Overall I don't think I'll ever watch this movie again because I don't think there's more to be analyzed, I dont think the cinematography is fantastic enough to rewatch it either, I didn't get attached to the characters... In short, it is a good movie but doesn't quite deliver after seeing all these 10/10 reviews. I do have to say that the last movie I watched was Midsommar, which blew me away, so compared to it this movie is pretty bland."
" It does say folktale
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"First I watched it then I read the reviews. What is disappointing is not the movie but the moronic opinions of some.It is a folktale based on superstition, live with it. It does what it says, it is beautifully shot and acted and if one does not understand the language here's a hint: finishing primary school may be crucial in intellectual development.Not for everyone, no matrix style action scenes, cgi and all out gore, more surreal, ethereal spookiness and hysteria of a family in seclusion. Somehow the atmosphere reminded me of ""Under The Skin"" with Scarlett Johansson. Watch at own risk but don't complain like an old woman."
" The Witch
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,9,"We see the witch in the second scene of the film. She cuts a baby into pieces and rubs its blood on her naked body. You can see this isn't one of those 'is there/isn't there? (yes, there always is)' kind of horror films. ""The Witch"" sacrifices faint surprise for the sake of drama, and is all the better for it.The slaughtered victim was the youngest member of a puritan family in seventeenth century New England. Father William (Ralph Ineson) has been banished from the Plymouth Colony after a religious dispute, and settled in exile with his wife (Kate Dickie) and five children at the edge of a dark forest.The film's focus is their oldest daughter, Tomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), who is entering a sinful puberty. The girl's position within the family is precarious. Her father loves her; her mother does not; her siblings are about split even. The fact that she was looking after the baby when it disappeared does not improve her standing. The more she is driven into a corner, the harder she struggles, slowly becoming the family's black sheep (or should I say 'black goat'?).The key to ""The Witch""'s success lies in its characters. More specifically: in the fact that they are not bad people. They are flawed. William is proud; both he and his son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) are liars; Katherine is psychotic; and the young twins are monsters, as children of that age tend to be. But as a family, they do try to live as best they can. You are not dying for these people to meet their end. Instead, you gaze in despair as their world falls apart.Much of the credit goes to Robert Eggers' work as writer and director. I am spoiled with choice for examples of the amazing skill he displays. One from the beginning: William is talking with his son, Caleb. He is sure a wolf took his baby. As he talks, he picks up a corncob, black with rot. 'We must catch our food if we cannot grow it.'Amazing how much character, situation, and plot can be glanced from eleven syllables. And sometimes we don't even need the words. Pay attention to the cinematography, how Caleb's looks at Tomasin (in a POV shot) always run over her chest. One small camera movement illustrates the challenges of growing up in such strict circumstances better than any soliloquy.As you may by now suspect, ""The Witch"" is more of a character drama than a horror film, its story bearing a closer resemblance to ""Through a Glass Darkly"" than to ""The Shining"". But this is the kind of drama that creeps under your skin -- indeed, very much like an Ingmar Bergman film. More and more, witchery begins to feel like a liberation rather than an expression of the darkness that lies within humans.It just goes to show what careful context brings to a story. The little girl from ""The Exorcist"" can use all foul words known to man without being as disturbing as a puritan boy shouting 'Sin! Sin! Sin!' All because Robert Eggers took fifty witchless minutes to build his characters and their world.That ""The Witch"" was his first feature film remains hard to believe. In both writing and directing he shows an understanding of his craft that many filmmakers can't hope to reach in a lifetime. One wonders whether he signed some black book himself."

",2020-04-27 00:00:00,7,"This film would be best told as a bedtime story to your 10 year old daughter. it has impeccable costumes and the atmosphere of the setting is unnerving.
Remember! Its just a folktale from a puritan's point of view.
DO NOT EXPECT A SLASHERLord of all might and majesty,
bind the power of Satan,
block the progress of Satan,
banish the presence of Satan,
and free his prisoners;
through the holy name of Jesus. Amen"
" amazing debut
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,8,"WHAT A DEBUT FOR EGGERS!!!!
This is a amazing and unusual horror movie. The movie doesn't have any jump scares, it isn't a horror movie for mainstream audiences. The performances are great, the directing and the cinematography are brilliant. It is a one of the best and one of the most beautiful movies of 2015. The writing is intelligent and the story is very interesting and captivating. I love the dialog and how Robert Eggers puts so much effort to be as similar as possible with the time period. I personally prefer The Lighthouse over this one but both are great I am sure Eggers will be a legend of cinema. Also the story is full of metaphors and similarities to the bible and Christianity"
" VERY BIG DISSAPOINTMENT !
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,1,"What a shame. I started by watching a day before, Emma 2020, Jane Austin book, with this young and talented actress Anja Taylor Joy. I was surprised and very pleased with that movie. Than I saw what she did before. The Witch 2015.
What a big crap and idiocy. I zipped to the movie and throw it in the Bin.
Who needs this type of garbage ! It really amazes me what kind of primitive heads made this stupidity and make even money on it. The good taste is lost !"
" Confused by the excitement if this film.
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,6,"Well done (both by the director and the actors) film depicting ostracization from persecutory and the descent into paranoia leading to the entrance of evil. Humph. While visually inticing and the story is well played by the actors, this doesn't come together enough to make a ""film"". It is excellent in its pieces, but I didn't find that it took me to a higher level of cinematic experience. I can appreciate slow burn films and have enjoyed many. This slow burn seems to lead me to a sparkler, and while still ""beautiful"" in its essence, decidedly underwhelming"
" A Boring Movie
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,3,"I love a well made movie, but this one is just stifling boring. Not much else to say."
" One of the best

" An OK movie
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,5,"The Witch was quite slow, very very few ""scare"" scenes. This movie had alot of potential! I would not watch it again as I found it quite boring."
" Just boring!

" Would rate 0 if could
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,1,"Okay wtf, if you are looking for a decent horror movie do NOT watch this. I have wasted 1 and half hours of my life, I will never get this time back"
" The Witch is visually resplendent, aurally meticulous, and singularly crafted to evoke dread from opening to close.
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,8,"Big fan of this movie. Fantastic acting by Anya Taylor-Joy (Thomasin), Ralph Ineson (the father, William), the adorably diabolical twins, and of course, Black Phillip. Much like other recent A24 horror films like Hereditary and Midsommar, it is more of a slow-burn movie and also shares a bit of a 'left-turn' ending that I wasn't crazy about. Still, as a whole it was great and is one of my favorite horror films."
" Thumbs up
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,10,"This is by far one of the best horror movies I've ever watch in my life time ,the whole story and the time setting made it even more realistic and eerie and dark ,I wish it was longer and a little more screen play of Satan in the end but it was perfect in my opinion."
" now i know not to bring my whole family to setlle right in the back of the woods
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,9,"The witch was a title which not everyone would caught the ideas but a few will take this movie to highest place as the suspense built-up through plot and great acting so riveting. to say the least, it's despise the generic formula of horror movie, and deliver a disturbing aspects of horror, that you know something bad would happen, but no one of you can sort it out. there's no jump scares like hype-horror movies that flooded screens theater recently. but that woods will give you a chill, the true horror awaits patiently scene after scene"
" a marvelous atmosphere
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,6,"For certain, The Vvitch is as creepy as it is captivating. Evil goats, crazy mothers, ultra-religious fathers... It has all the nice topics and with a chilling soundtrack, it makes this movie quite worth it."
" This movie doth sucked balls from thy goat
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,1,"Made an account just to let everyone know, this movie sucked. There is no witch. You see them at the end for like 2 seconds. Thats it. Don't waste your time."
" Utter pretentious crap. Don't be fooled by the high praise here
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,3,"Production, costume and art director Eggers gets his first feature debut here. Personally from this unknown critic's point of view, he should stay away from the camera. But then given the huge profit this film rutned around, I guess we will be seeing much more from him as the average movie-goer seemed to lap this one up, despite it being very much mutton dressed as lamb in cinematic form.In the early seventeenth century, we start with what appears to be some kind of trial which which our characters are trying to do something or have done something, nothing really is obvious. Naturally they lose whatever it is they are having a hearing about and our hapless family leave the small village in which they reside and go out on their own. They eventually end on a clearing at the edge of a large wood, whereby they promptly kneel and begin to pray.The family starts a new life for themselves here with a small homestead like farm. Daily life is a routine for the family with the children do what they do as well as helping to tend to the many chores around the place. But the darkness of the wood is an ever-looming presence over their lives and as they will soon find out, can contain many an evil within. Looking after her newborn sibling, Thomasin (Taylor-Joy) momentarily looks away then realises that the baby is missing from right in front of her while the ominous dark wood and trees look on.So let us start with the good. Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of this film is that it was nearly all shot with nothing but natural light. This does show in parts more than others but is impressive all the same and does add some level of authenticity. Along these lines, the costumes and sets are also quite good and the use of locations are shot well to match the rest of the film. Unfortunately though these are perhaps the only highlights.Compared to the very soft audio in general, the score is very jarring and cold. Once again, a film (and or it's audio directors) fail to try and normalise the soundtrack resulting in lots of uneccessary volume changes with the remote. Again guys, this is basic film study stuff. While music and ambient audio is important, it does not need to drown out what people are saying, or need to blow peoples ear drums apart after they have been struggling to listen to a conversation due to more badly optmised audio.While this film has been praised as a horror masterclass, I have to wonder what exactly they see in 'good' horror, as this feature is so incredibly dull it numbs the senses. I'm all for slow films with long build-ups but there needs to be much better acting and a script in order for this to actually work. The children have to be perhaps some of the annoying I have witnessed on screen, and as for the witch herself, well, given her whole three minutes of screen-time they should have considered calling this film The Woods instead.With plenty of religious (most likely accurate the era and location) and sexual symbolism the film certainly tries to be a lot more intelligent than it actually is. I'm really struggling to see exactly what this film wanted to be or what tyhe directors vision was, or even for that matter what the point in making it all was. Simple folk being unbelievably stupid with a catastrophic mess of nonsense as an ending. I thy were thinking to maybe this thine film then perhaps thy probably should.
The Sage's Rating: 3/10"
" This is how a horror movie should be treated
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,9,"This is a great horror movie, one of the best there is. Moreover, it is a great movie, without regards to the genre.Opposite to cliche horrors, the VVitch is all about the plot, its different milestones and characters' impressions of them. In the best traditions of Lovecraft-inspired scary stories, it never actually shows ""the monster"", but speaks of its unspeakable devilish wickedness with words of main heroes. At some point the ideas in their heads seem to be more vile and cruel than the reality they face.Some scenes (especially frequent close-ups) makes one assume that the story revolves around a girl, named Thomasin, played incredibly by Anya Taylor-Joy, but, to my mind, she represents kind of a medium, which links viewer with the story, while what fuels it are those puritan ideas, which elevate the level of fear in other characters and distort their perception until the reality is explained perfectly in the available framework.Finally, the mood and the ambience are spot on! The majority of the developing events took place in gloomy and isolated sites, also offering some symbolism to note and speculate with.All in all, this movie is about the true nature of fear. It is subtly crafted with a great attention to detail, which makes it a must-watch to any fan of the genre."
" Hypnotic and Surreal
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,10,"Exceptional story, writing and direction create a haunting and mesmerizing flick about a time in history we rather not talk about anymore. This ain't The Crucible my dear readers. This is a fantastic foray into a language and culture that was fiercely religious and completely afraid of their Creator. In this scary time of pandemic all over the world we would do well to take some extra time to pray to God and meditate on his power to keep us away from evil lurking in human beings - not to mention animals. This family pf puritans sacrificed living in a community no longer tied to a a heavenly reckoning in order to live a solitary life of confinement. Idleness and hunger breeds jealousy and hallucinations that are a pestilence to their heart and very souls. Believe me, a more relevant and disquieting film ye shallt not see with thine eyes forevermore."
" One of the worst movies ever made
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,1,"A marathon of starship troopers and all it's sequels sounds more appealing than ever watching this garbage again.
Everything was a disaster. The story is a cliché but could have worked if not for:
-horrible acting
-the worst ""trying to do some old English"" accents ever.
-the dark filter in a pathetic attempt to create a spooky atmosphere.
-the annoying and complete off musical score that didn't make it exciting but is just damn annoying.The black goat deserves all the credit here since he was the only convincing character.
All the ""10"" reviews are either payed or written by people that should stop watching movies all together or start over again starting with Bambi."
" Not your average horror movie
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,7,"The Witch is one of the best horror movies I've seen. The production design and the use of mostly natural light creates a realistic environment which reinforces the audience's suspension of disbelief which, in my opinion, is more important in horror movies than in movies of other genres. Eggers manages to create a dark atmosphere which makes you feel uneasy throughout the movie, a quality he improves on in The Lighthouse (2019). A common criticism of many horror movies is that they use cheap pop-up scares to scare the viewers, something Eggers avoids in this movie. There are only three, maybe four, scenes that look like other horror movies. The rest of the horror comes from the paranoia and distrust within the family the movie depicts. Strong 7/10-"
" Fantastic Historical Supernatural Horror
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,8,"The Witch is... something. It is not a traditional horror film, and really, the only apt comparison I can come up with is Eggers' other major film, The Lighthouse, mixed with a bit of Midsommar. Regardless, it is an awesome film. Eggers' writing and direction, combined with perfect acting and an immersive set design, create a chilling tale that stands out among modern horror.First off, the acting. Wow. Each actor in this film is incredible, despite half of the cast being child actors. And I don't mean good acting, when you are watching and think, ""that actor is doing great right now"". I was not even registering that they were actors at all, I was so immersed. And their colonial dialect was authentic yet understandable, and seemed to be spoken completely naturally, which is often difficult to pull off. Each character became paranoid or corrupted throughout the film, creating a suspenseful tone that lasted the whole movie. I would like to specifically recognize Ralph Ineson, as the tormented, prideful, authoritative, and increasingly uncontrolled father. His performance stood out among an impressive cast as one of the best I've seen in horror.Of course, this acting would be nothing without the writing that make this so convincing. Using writings from the period, Eggers makes the dialogue feel real, not like our interpretation of how they sounded. And the progression of the film makes it feel like a ""slow burn"" movie, yet so many events are put into the 92 minute film, that it is constantly entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat. The exploration of the themes of paranoia, corruption, and religion are obvious, but not thrown in your face. The viewer will ""get it"", but not feel like it's just been entirely handed to them.The set design and direction compliment the other factors in making a complete atmosphere for this film. The farm is shabby and poor, and in seemingly every shot, you can see the weak, unappealing crops, a subtle reminder of the coming desperation of the family. The woods loom over them ominously, never easing the feeling of dread and mystery. The movie is mostly lit by candlelight and features many close up shots of the characters, which outside of showcasing their acting chops, also keeps the viewer in the same position as the characters: wondering what will happen next.All in all, The Witch is a stunningly suspenseful film, immersive in all aspects. Much like other A24 horror films, it is not something you can shake off right after viewing. It is absolutely worth a watch, but maybe not right before going out with friends."
" Christians are weird!
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,4,Watch this if you want to watch a wacko Christian family. If not just skip this try hard horror movie. Booooring
" Sorry... I just didn't like it.
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,1,"After reading all the positive reviews I couldn't wait to watch The Witch. Unfortunately, I found the movie to be extremely slow and boring with a disappointing ending."
" Season of the VVitch
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,8,"Bleak, depressing and unnerving. ""The VVitch"" will shake your soul cold and question your own loyalty for the sake of survival. Simply trust no one...."
" The Witch
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,3,"Watched it with hype , but it turned out to be one of the worst horror movie I've ever seen.,"
" Unnerving, compelling but afraid to embrace ambiguity (thematic spoilers)
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,8,"An unnerving piece, focusing in on self-imposed isolation emerging from a desire to be doctrinally pure. The film ostensibly builds on how a family, moving themselves away from the Pilgrim community with whom they entered the New World at the behest of a devout and driven father, begin to develop paranoid notions regarding their fate, both related to their abandonment by God and the influence of darker forces. The pacing of all this is done incredibly well and the acting compelling, especially the younger actors, who I feared were verging on being traumatised such was their commitment. If anything, the ending let's the building tension down little, giving as it does an unequivocal answer to the central concerns being presented throughout. I did wonder if leaving everything ambiguous might have been a bolder approach. As it is, arguably what is presented as explanation lets certain family members' perspectives off the hook somewhat."
" Almost
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,4,"There is a lot of good cinematography and sound design here, but The Witch really loses itself as the story develops."
" An horror movie with gives much attention to period details
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,7,"When ""The lighthouse"" (2019, Robert Eggers) came out I intended to see also his debut film ""The witch"" (2015). When ""The lighthouse"" turned out to be a disappointment I began to doubt if I would still see ""The witch"". After all I am glad I have done it. ""The witch"", which has much in common with the Estonian film ""November"" (2017, Rainer Sarnet), is a more subdued and a better film than ""The lighthouse"".""The witch"" has been carefully made. Much effort has been put in getting the period details right. One example of this is the use of antiquated language.This attention for period details has made ""The witch"" into a multi layered film. Layer 1 has to do with the extent to which the events are shocking for the viewer. Layer 2 concerns the extent to which the events are shocking to the main characters. With respect to layer 2 one has to consider that the main characters are deeply religious people for whom there is no real difference between the natural world and the supernatural world.The fear for the devil is for them very real. Because the devil can appear in various manifestations (including taking possession of a human being), this fear gives rise to a growing sense of distrust within the family. This fear and the resulting distrust in layer 2 makes the film more tense in layer 1. One can see the same effect in science fiction films in which an alien can take on a human form. See for example ""The invasion of the body snatchers"" (1956, Don Siegel) or ""The thing"" (1982, John Carpenter)."
" Good acting, good horror, short story
",2020-03-11 00:00:00,7,"This movie is great. You should watch it if you're into witchcraft and sorcery, satanism or if you just wanna look good old fashioned arthouse style horror, nearly without jump scares.What I didint like was that it wasn't really clear why the daughter does what she does. For me I was interested in the witches and their power, but nobody get to see. Even if one does not show their power entirely I think one has to develop the magic and power more to make it believable that they are somehow interesting for young women. All in all I like the movie a lot, but many questions were unanswered which I don't like."
" Beautiful, dark and pointless
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,4,That awful script that leads to nowhere ruins the beautiful scenery. Acting is average.
" Surprisingly Good
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,9,"I am not really a horror movie fan. I can tolerate Stephen King at times, and I can enjoy an old Lon Chaney or Vincent Price flick. But, to my mind, horror is not the same as suspense. A finely crafted scene implying gore is much more artistic and compelling than a blood-filled chainsaw scene. The Witch is not a horror film, and yet the events are horrible. It is a really good film worth watching. And maybe a second watching."
" Just one problem
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Okay there is a lot to like about the Witch... it all slowly builds tension in a very unique setting (for a horror). Unfortunately (like so many witch movies before it) the ending doesn't deliver. If it was me, why not allow the innocent girl to be fooled by the Witch? Maybe the Witch says the place they were living in is cursed, but as long as she stays with her, she'll be safe? Something like that? Instead what we got was just floating witches.Still worth the watch, just let down by a unsurprising ending."
" Horror as a tale
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,10,"The story is narrated as a old dark tale, that is looking for deep emotion than a easy stereotyped scare."
" Great from start to finish.
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,10,No cheap jump scares. Well written and a great job all around. Enjoyed every minute.
" A Very Griping Tale
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,7,This directors debut is a showcase of skill and horror. I have nothing else to say other than i highly suggest this film.
" One of the better horror films of the 2010's.
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,10,"I am really surprised by the relative low rating on here. I guess the slow pace and that the film is focused on religious doubt throws a lot of people off. To me this is archetypal tale of witchcraft and I love the film's refusal to explain anything in great detail. There is a naturalism to the acting and the setting that lends itself to this feeling like folktale handed down by the generations. The film's quite unnerving specifically because much of the details are left to the imagination. While the film is ultimately supernatural horror I found the film's treatment of a family dynamics getting frayed to more emotionally involve then the average horror film. And the father's pride getting the best of him really works as a religious message.In any case the visual lushness, especially the cinematography, of the film is rather hypnotic and the film has quiet power to it. Eggers is a really gifted director at invoking mood and atmosphere. This feels like a Puritan warning more than a modern horror film.Good film"
" ""What went we out into this wilderness to find?""
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,8,"Robert Eggers vividly recreates an authentic Puritan world in this unnerving film boosted by a strong atmosphere and tremendous performances from its cast. Ralph Ineson steals the show here as William, a devout Christian father who takes his family out of the plantation they are living in after a disagreement he has on religious matters with the plantation leaders. They set their markers down in the New England wilderness, and begin to farm. Strange and devastating things begin to occur before long. The baby Samuel vanishes while outside with the eldest daughter Thomasin (brilliant performance by Anya Taylor-Joy) and the crops fail. Facing starvation, the family soon begins to turn on each other, as Puritan fears and paranoia suffocate the household.""The Witch"" offers a subtle type of horror in an original and unique setting. The film plays like you are watching a heavy drama on stage (""The Crucible"", perhaps?) and yet the horror elements just keep building and building, accompanied by a strange score, and serve to rack up the tension, and your nerves, before reaching its crescendo in the final scene. Eggers put a marker down with this film. What more is to come?"
" Witches aren't born . . . they're MADE.
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,9,"Yeah, this is one of the good ones. A family of outcasts are besieged by evil, an evil that attempts to shatter the family unit by creating an atmosphere of paranoia amongst them, turning them against one another. Against one character in particular. All to isolate and infect said character with hopelessness. Leaving the innocent character with nothing but a string of betrayals by everyone she ever loved-this is how you make a witch. The authenticity of the dialogue is unbelievable. The locations really feel like the untainted America, pre 1700's. You are in the middle of nowhere, outcast, under attack and with no one to help you. I felt like I was peering into the past, witnessing something horrible that really happened, but was lost to history. The imagery and symbolism are mind blowing. I don't buy many films, but I did this one."
" THE WITCH disgorges a deferential awe to the mysticism and regards our human folly with a cold glare
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,8,"""In the thick of its blame-throwing, hallucination-effecting, sin-confessing chaos, all hell breaks loose with predictable outcomes, sinners must pay for their sins, whether it is pride or wrath, and Thomasin, ever elfin and dainty as a wide-eyed hare, eventually confirms our trepidation when she signs a book with the devil and eventually relishes in a witches' sabbath. Anya Taylor-Joy is a revelation who abandons herself to the rawest emotional states, while the close-knit cast is overall impressive, Ralph Ineson is alternatively sympathetic and antipathetic (when the Electra complex gives way to entrenched oscillation) as the beleaguered breadwinner, a gaunt-looking Kate Dickie stands out from the crowd as a tremendous force of grief, ire and desolation, by the same token, child actor Harvey Scrimshaw might touch on overacting in his final emotive outpouring of demonic possession.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore"
" No seat jumper, but more of a hair-raising chill
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,8,"I liked it. I think it has qualities. It is no action movie.
It has a feeling i have not had since ""Omen""
Its like a slow descent into madness, how it must feel if you are
going insane.
And i am sure many of the people back then, living off the land,
living in the woods, hard work, little to eat and harsh conditions, felt that
religion and superstition was much closer connected to their destiny.When the daughter, sitting in the shed, hears the soft voice and is finally convinced to convert, i could feel the hair in my neck rubbing against my sweater, and i was afraid to blink.
My kind of horror, i love it. Absolutely recommended."
" Not for everyone

" Not bad for horror.
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Horror just doesn't scare me, so I often find myself laughing at an attempt to scare me. This takes away from the joy many of the fans of this genre have. So what's left when I watch horror, is story, acting, and originality. I think this movie pulls this off, it is based on various sources of material from when it is set. It is stark and minimal. There is some shocking stuff, the characters are believable, the story is interesting. I say if you are a fan of cinema and/or horror this movie should be appealing."
" True psychological horror
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,9,"I went in expecting an atypical horror movie, and I got exactly what I expected. I advise you to watch this movie alone in a dark room, on the biggest screen in your house with the best soundsystem.The Witch is a textbook example of psychological horror done right. It doesen't rely on cheap jumpscares like modern horror movies, but manages to chill you to the bone with how everything is presented. Pair the amazing performances by the actors with the great sound design, and add a dash of gruesome imagery and you get The Witch."

",2020-01-18 00:00:00,8,"I'm pretty hard to please, I find most horrors pretty pathetic and I'm extremely hard to creep out, but The Witch was great, it didn't quite creep me out but it was very eerie.. Only thing that comes close to creeping me out as much have been Exorcist, The Wailing, Hereditary and The Ring."
" Don't.

""It feels like we're watching something we're should not be seeing."" Indeed, cuz this movie sucked.
There was no tension, no suspense, no nothing. The only thing that kept me from falling asleep during the movie were people who were constantly talking during the whole movie. Not to mention half of them stood up and left after 30 minutes."
" Robert Eggers is way above the average
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Written and directed by Robert Eggers, ""The Witch"" represents one of the highest artistic peak that horror cinema has ever reached. This movie tries to improve the visual concept of this genre with incredible direction and stunning photography, offering some photograms that clearly remind to flemish painting of 600. Is clear that technically and artistically this cinema piece is close to perfection. But ""The Witch"" is more than just art. In the movie there is a constant conflict between good and evil, life and death, humanity and supernatural, Christ and Satan, with a complex and elaboreted symbology. While you watch the film, the story of this unlucky family keeps growing in you with a succeeded climax of anxiety and paranoia that finds its peak in the terrifyng final. ""The Witch"" is beatiful, intriguing, terrifyng and terribly complex but maybe it will leave you with a sense of emptiness mixed with disappointment for not having understood the meaning of the film which is subjective and unclear."
" Why does this have such high reviews??
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,3,"Okay just wanna say i watched this many months ago and only wanted to submit a review because of the high review score this has.. here's why.Plot:
This movie is boring, like really really boring. It has lots of plot direction that leads no where and constant silence and confusion plagues this movie. The cast is good but the plot is incredibly bad and directing just as bad that this becomes hard to finish.Acting:
The acting is the best part of this film. They have a good cast but with such bad directing, dialog and story leads to the performances being meaningless. You cant fix bad characters with good actors, you just cant.Cinematography:
Now the special affects and scenes are done weirdly. Not good and a matter of fact not scary at all. The tone of this seems strange rather than immersive and thrilling.Summary:
Please dont watch this, Its long and extremely boring. I love horror movies but this is no horror. More like a weird telling of strange circumstances happening to a family which doesnt lead anywhere and isnt spooky. You've been warned."
" Most Realist Vitch Film Ever Made

" The New England Folktale
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,8,"I'm not gonna lie, I decided to watch this movie because of Robert Eggers new release ""The Lighthouse"" which I really enjoyed. I'm not particularly fond of horrors (or lobsters) and the last one I actually enjoyed was ""A Quiet Place"".After watching ""The Witch"" I had a scroll through other people reviews, and one thing that struck me was that a whole lot of one star comments came from people where ""The Witch"" is their only written review to date. With a lot of horrific movies out there, this movie defied their expectations so hard that they wrote this one and only review, that's pretty telling!Main reason to review it badly was that ""It wasn't scary"". In my opinion the trailer for ""The Witch"" is at fault in this case, the movie is described here as: ""One of the most genuinely unnerving horror film in recent memory"" David Ehrlich or ""A nightmarish picture that will make your blood run cold"" Rodrigo Perez, accompanied by the ""scariest"" images taken from the movie and dramatic score, sadly trailer did this movie a big disfavor.Meanwhile on the poster we can only read ""The New England Folktale. Evil takes many forms"" well that's more like it!To get things straight, ""The Witch"" It is not a horror movie, although it contains many elements of good horrors like the sense of dread, despair, distrust, confusion or doom. But never are those emotions played to please the audiences need to be scared. It is rather the contrary, where the movie dissects and tries to explain where all those emotions may come from, meandering at the same time between reality and fable-tale, challenging you to answer what is true, and what really disturbs you as a viewer. If you approach ""The Witch"" like this you shouldn't walk away dissapointed, but if you are looking for jump-scares and visceral images look somewhere else."
" Real horror are not jumpscares!
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,9,One of the best directorial debuts and horror films for me. The atmosphere just draws you into the 17th century and into the film. It doesn't have stupid jumpscares but rather focuses on tone and psychological tension just like The Shining. The last scene will haunt me for the rest of my life.
" A masterpiece in every sense of the word
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,10,The Witch is a deeply unsettling period piece/horror film that will make you want to take a shower afterwards. I love it.
" Cinematic Excellence
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,8,"One of the more impressive film debuts in recent memory. Robert Eggers sets the tense and claustrophobic tone from the first frame. Everything about this film feels menacing and dark, from thr music to the scenery. The acting is superb."
" Utter trash
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,1,Don't bother and don't get scammed by this steaming pile of boring you know what. Avoid avoid !
" It was fantastic until the ending, which spoiled the entire film.
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,5,"The premise was good, the plot fascinating but predictable and it was mildly scary, however, the ending destroyed it. It was extremely cliche and just... terrible. It could have been written so much better, but it was like the writers gave up, lost all creativity and dumped it out for quick cash. It's good enough to watch, but the ending destroys it."
" Weird Witch
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,7,"'The Witch' has a remarkable ability to sustain weird atmosphere and environment, and magical thinking almost throughout its runtime.A crafted and deliberate film which reflects on themes and tonal attributes clearly important to its filmmaker: writer-director Eggers; this directness of vision benefits 'The Witch' greatly.Technical credits and production standards are of a commendably high and effective standard.The period portrayal, whilst necessarily dramatically formulated, is immensely interesting: the language and accents, including the ""vocabulary of ideas"" of the protagonists is a particular high point in this historical horror.On the flip side most of the best moments of the film are clustered towards the first half with a diminution of highlights as the film progresses.The climax is perhaps rather modern in its sensibilities which I found to be really jarring after a film that is constrained to its depicted environment so rigorously by the writing and directing almost all through the prior runtime.Some of the character scenes between family members could have been more energetically staged and frame compositions are sometimes unable to make use of all the potential of the environment.For a considerable contribution to the historical horror/folk horror genres, and from a first time director, 'The Witch' is a strong announcement of a filmmaker with vision and purpose; in itself there is much to commend.I rate 'The Witch' a 7/10 and I would particularly recommend to fans of psychological horror/thrillers, historical films, folk horror and witchcraft/black magic horror.....it is far from perfect but with allowances made for a first time director this is a really good if not quite a very best or great standard film."
" Terrible accents from lead man
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,4,Trying way too hard to speak ye olde language that its taking everything away from the film. Its hard to notice what's happening because of the way they're speaking.
" Brilliant
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,9,"I'll start by saying that most everyone giving this film a 1 star rating is probably into hollywood ""horror"" trash like the Annabelle films.This film is so much more than tension breaking jumpscares and basic, predictable plot. Genuinely this was the first original horror film I've seen in a long time. It was refreshing to watch actual horror that doesn't try to get cheap scares out of you. It was an immersive experience, and even though I knew I could press the pause button to go grab a snack, I never did.Highly recommend this to anyone who isn't into bad scary movies."
" By MsClashKing YT
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Fantastic , The Witch gives the viewers a very creepy vibe that works
A+"
" Finally something fresh in the horror genre
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,9,"You probably know already that The VVitch is not like the many formulaic horror films out there, with jumpscares and other clichés.I am not a fan of morror films, mostly because I am easily scared, but this one is fantastic and for my taste. I was not scared during the movie, I saw it during daytime, so this made things easier, watching it at night would not do me good. The beauty of this film is, for me, the atmosphere, taking place in the XVII century, packed with many thee and thou, with a religious puritan family, and the psychological horror, you don't if what you see is something supernatural or not, until the last thirty minutes obviously. Some scenes are disturbing, yet subtle, I think, and this is why I loved this film. I liked all the characters, most of them were used in the best way possible, didn't like the twins. Anya-Taylor Joy and Ralph Ineson, his voice suited perfectly with the film concept, were great here. The disturbing aspect, the tension, the moments that were unsettling, the build-up, everything here is great. The costume design, the production design, the soundtrack, the cinematography here, it is perfect, and looks like the film was shot during the 17th century, it was so emmersive, at least for me, I am a history fanboy so the experience was amazing.Oh, and Black Phillip. One more reason to love this film."
" Poorly executed
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,5,"What could have been a chilling, complex, and dark tale feels and is executed more as a dull, lifeless, and contrived film longing for any story. The film is quite boring, and throughout its somehow short runtime- although it certainly doesn't feel short- the film seems to go pretty much no where, and when it does try to do something, it simply makes no sense while doing so and doesn't explain a thing. The actors do give it their all, as dull as the script may be, with Anna-Taylor Joy being the obvious standout. In the end, The Witch feels like a better film that could have been than it was. It makes for some chilling moments, but doesn't have enough substance or scares to truly grab your attention, or enough story to satisfy.
My Rating: 6/10"
" Scariest witch film you'll see
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,8,"Watched this for the second time and it remains such a genuinely frightening film. While the olde English can initially be off putting, you get the gist of it and I think it serves to portray the primitive horror of the times (as mentioned by the notes at the end about records and diaries of witch hunts). Some parts are absolutely chilling and it's probably the most authentic and terrifying witch movie I've seen. That ending scene haunted me."
" FABULOUS SLOW BURN HORROR.
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,8,"Fabulous slow burn with a lovely, violent ending. Impeccable acting by all actors. It doesn't follow the stereotypical jumpy fast paced horror movie but it's extremely effective in building tension."
" A horror movie for more sophisticated watchers as well as those with a love of slowburn tension
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,8,"Let me say: this is not your typical horror movie. This is a film that relies on slow, slow tension, to the point it could probably be a thriller if it weren't for the horrific imagery. It's relatively sparse on jump scares (which, in my opinion, makes them more effective), there's no over-the-top gore (once again, used sparsely and mainly offscreen, therefore more effective), and the movie has one element that will either endear viewers or turn them away: period-accurate English. Seriously, unless you're a fan of Nathaniel Hawthorne novels and can understand the kind of English the pilgrims spoke, it might be best you watch this movie with subtitles.Nonetheless, this is a really good movie. The acting is incredibly spot-on, even that of the young children. Anya Taylor-Joy is a standout as she's arguably caught in the center of most of the story's conflicts. Each actor makes it believable that they are suffering through the hardness of the undiscovered American wilderness made worse by their own paranoias. The costumes are spot-on, the movie's mythology pays a ton of respect to real-world witch lore, and I recently learned that the movie was filmed using only natural lighting, which certainly adds to the feeling that we're enduring the family's hardships alongside them. And the entire movie absolutely drips with tension as we're left wondering how long it will take for everything to fall apart and what will be the main cause of everything: either the family's world or the family themselves. Blend this in with some truly disturbing imagery (occasionally made laughable by the complex English) and you've got yourself quite an unconventional horror flick.In conclusion: slowburn horror film with great acting, plenty of tension, disturbing imagery, and the required usage of subtitles"
" Worst movie of all time.
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,1,"Absolutely disgusting within minutes and I will never recover. I honestly think that whoever directed this movie is in prison already because of the thoughts roaming around in his head. Please put best wishes forth for me, as I am losing my grip on reality thinking about the naked old lady that appeared in the first 3 minutes of this film. I give up. This is it. Tell my mum I love her. Babies die in this movie, but I died today."
" YUCK
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,2,Thy can't stand this movie. Thy givith credit to the trailer editors for they excellent deception!
" Excellent but Slightly Misunderstood Film
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,10,"The title of this film is The VVitch. Should the film be scary? Yes. Is this film scary? Yes. Are the audiences of today willing to invest some effort into understanding a film that isn't just another rehashing of ""She's All That""? Doubtful.*SLIGHT SPOILERS*
These are Puritans. The tone and language is from the 1600s. They escaped Europe, then exiled from their plantation when the father disagreed with its evolving religious beliefs, they pressed on. Actions have consequences. Being isolated has it's merits but again, it has drawbacks and consequences. This film captures the horror of the 1600s (including internal family affairs), religious differences and of course witchery. Brilliantly directed, shot and acted. The setting drips with the thoughts, prayers and ultimate damnation of this family as we the viewers never lose the vague yet acute energy of opportunistic ""VVitch"" in the forest. The colors are pale if not washed out. The VVitch herself is not shown often but when it comes time to deliver the goods.. this film does. The Devil, or in this case, the VVitch is in the little details. A film that was researched for five years to adhere to colonists like these in New England.. in around the 1630s. The wardrobe, the accents, the speech patterns and language. In many cases the last was lifted from court records and journals of the time.VVitch it for the story, performances, the ominous score, and ""Black Phillip"". VVitch it for the playful period dialogue among the family (mostly between the children) VVitch it for ""Thomasin"" crying wolf leading to the unintended proverbial... Witch it for The VVitch, the rabbit and the goat.. who all happen to be creepy. Witch it for the perfect ending and think about the people, the setting the atmosphere, the misunderstandings and circumstances that they had to endure. All of VVitch culminated in Thomasin's decision. Essential viewing."
" Great movie(watch with subtitles)
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,8,"People want realism in movies, then complain when a movie is as accurate a depiction of its time frame as it can be. As stated in my headline, I highly recommend watching with subtitles. You will understand alot better if you do.This is just a well made story about a deeply religious family who after being banished from thier colony falls apart due to tragic events both natural and supernatural."
" Great horror flick!!!!!
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,10,"I suggest this to anyone who likes horror movies that are slow but worthwhile in the end with a very hood twist that's basically Not seen at all till it happens
Really great horror flick overall"
" Atmospheric, drawn out, somewhat predictable horror.
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,7,"So it took me 3 viewings of this film. I think the pacing had something to do with that. I wasn't in the right mindset for a horror film this atmospheric. The trailers made it seem like this film would be sheer terror. However, much of the uneasiness comes from the music and the shots. The blood and gore in this was somewhat minimal. Nudity, yes but necessary? Not sure. We have little screen time with the actual coven. But despite the twins trying to ""frame""
their older teenage sister, I guessed less than 1/2 way though the film that she would later become one, or was already one. The black goat was slightly predictable as the devil too. I appreciate this film's pacing, and most of the acting. At times I felt the performance was too restrained, but perhaps the filmmaker was trying to stay true to puritanical times. However, the mother was annoying to me and unfair. But I guess she was right in the end. Too bad she didn't live to see it."
" The Witch
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,10,I think The film requires a certain audience but if that involves you it's a hell of a watch very interesting and disturbing film

" What original movies should be about
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,9,"People rating this low are angry that they had to watch a movie that was original and wasn't MADE FOR THEM VIA TEST AUDIENCES. Give us your money and leave for being lame. I'm hoping for more from the director, this didn't have a perfect plot, a perfect conclusion, a perfect meaning, it was just a really well made film with a strong script."
" One of my favorite non-traditional horror suspense movies.
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie for suspense thriller lovers. Not so much horror people. If you want some people being terrified and chased, this IS NOT the movie for you. This movie is very much about the thought of the Witch herself. Is she real? Is she made up? Is it a person? Is it supernatural?All these questions are the main drive of the story. It's a mental, slow, thought out, suspense horror. If you like picking apart movies, this is one for you."
" A travelling trader's tall tale of witchcraft
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,8,"This is an awesome movie in every way. Atmospheric and emotionally wrenching, It is the tale spun by a travelling trader who we assume comes upon a burned farmstead and the remains of the two adults, parents of five children, all missing. The trader is a regular traveller to the farmstead and brings them staple goods necessary for survival in the harsh New England environment that the Puritans had to endure,
In telling his tale to another Puritan, he spins a story arising from what was likely an attack by woodland Indians that becomes an uneven and extravagant, dramatic tale of witchcraft, heathenism, and magic, all aspects of the storyteller's yarn designed to provide both colourful narrative (A New England TALE) and a deeply frightening perspective for those Puritan listeners whose faith might ever be in peril of failing in the face of overwhelming hardships. The drama of his tale takes on almost giddy extravagance such as when the eldest boy, whom the storyteller paints as cursed, recites Milton in his death throws, Amazing performances throughout, Stunning sets and photography, A truly amazing ending to the tale, A must see,"
" witch
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,8,"Witch is horror that isnt for everyone taste and liking,it has pretty much artsy and slow plot that for some people is problem but not for me,it is good once in a while to see this kind of subject being potrayed in good and unseteling way,and by that it surpasses most of horror that relly on cliches and annoying jumpscares,witch is a very good horror even if isnt scary it has some creepy and disturbing vibe around it ,and some shock moments included that work great,only nitpick for me even if it isnt film fault,that i had problem in some moments understanding what characters were saying becase of their accents but that is easly ignored,witch is defienetly one of best horrors of recent years"
" Disturbing Take on Puritan Folktales
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,10,"(Rating as a movie) After watching The Witch, I felt something in my stomach. It was a feeling that I rarely feel after watching a film. The feeling that this movie created in my stomach was dread. Is this movie scary? I think so. But it wasn't the actual witch that had me sweating throughout the the film, rather, it was the psychological torment that the main characters were going through during the events of the movie. Seeing each character break down into madness was haunting, and was only complimented by the amazing soundtrack that added an extra layer of tension to each scene. The characters were extremely well written, each with their own motivations, fears, and flaws. The acting in this movie is fantastic, and never at any point did I not believe any of the characters, they were all portrayed very well, and even the child actors did a pretty good job. The whole film takes place around one small house, which creates a feeling of isolation and hopelessness, which is complimented by the film's ugly, grey color palette and dark lighting. Disturbing things happen throughout the film, but despite this, the film never relied on cheap gore to shock audiences, but rather sets up a disturbing canvas, and asks the viewer to paint the rest of the picture. It leaves the most disturbing moments up to interpretation, and as a result, made them more impactful to the audience. This psychological build up continues to grow until the very end, at which point the film just pours out all of the madness that it's built up for the audience to witness. I wouldn't classify The Witch as a horror, but rather, a dark drama with disturbing elements of horror sprinkled in. As a movie, I'd rate The Witch 10/10."
" Light! In a movie! Who needs that?
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,1,"Here is a rare thing, the critics love this horror movie from A24 and all I have to say is... WHY?! For a movie called ""The Witch"" or the ""VVitch"", the witches get little to know screentime and no dialog. We never find out why the family was banished and was it part of the coven's plot? The pacing is terrible, there are long stretches of nothing happening. The cinematography is horrible. It's so dark, even during the day. There is a scene where we see the coven dancing naked but the camera is like a football field away and the only light is a bloody campfire. It's boring, having a black goat the devil was so obvious they didn't even bother trying to hide it. He's on the cover. I've seen several movies from A24 and so far they have Brain Damage failure record. But somehow A24 gets praised when they're the same crap as Brain Damage. Lastly: SPOILER ALERT! FOR THOSE WHO DON'T WANT IT SPOILED, THEN STOP READING.: Everyone is dead and Thomasin, the eldest daughter joins the coven. Which makes no sense, that came out of nowhere and they butchered her family, so why?"
" Masterpiece of Horror
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,9,"At a time when horror movies are a dime a dozen, there are very few that manage to stand out from the crowd. The VVitch, or The Witch, is one of said movies. It's the work of Robert Eggers, who would later go on to do The Lighthouse. The premise is that puritan family in 1600s Massachusetts moves to the woods over a religious dispute and come to believe that they are being hunted by witches, or that there is a witch among them.The atmosphere in this film is fantastic. 80% of the movie is set in their small cabin and farm, with most of the remaining 20 in the woods. There is a strong sense of isolation, even among the group, which is felt by the audience. It's a very creepy film. It has zero jumpscares. The scary factor comes almost entirely from the tension built up throughout, and it's very effective.What's particularly notable about this film is the dialogue. It's not just set in the 1600s. They talk like it's the 1600s. The period accurate dialogue is fantastic and adds to the feeling of being in a different age. It's the same type of language you hear in Shakespeare. It feels very authentic. It's still understandable, because you still feel the weight of it in the visuals and emotion in the performances.Spoilers: the twist in this movie is the type that gets you off guard. The whole idea of the Devil taking the form of a goat is something that is known, as there is the image of Baphomet, a demonic entity seen in folklore who has the head of the goat. Everything about him is unsettling. The way he talks, the way he's barely visible... it's an unforgettable moment."
" It was sooooo boring
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,3,Everyone was saying how good this movie was so I decided to watch it. It was so boring I almost feel asleep. The only good stuff starting happening right near the end of the movie.
" Nha... Mostly just very weird. And kind of boring.
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,5,"Pretty weird movie. It probably has some underlying meanings if you want read into it and study it.It does not have that much action. It's a psychological thriller and drama, more then anything else. Can be a bit boring if you want action.Is it scary? I guess it can be. Is it good? It really depends on you. Not a normal gener movie in any way.Personally I did not like it that much watching it, thought it was boring and pointless. Afterwards it did stuck with me a bit, thinking about it I starting to like it more. It has something at least, something.This deprived worn down family was easy pickings for the lurking evil, and they faild as much to their own weaknesses and twisted minds, then to the evil it self. Good psychological thriller with a religious/christian theme. Not great though. Just good. Might see it again at some point, see if I missed something."
" DO NOT WATCH
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,1,"At the discretion of a few movie ""critics"" (people that work at a local movie shop), I decided to waste 5 dollars on this movie. I have no idea how this movie gets this good of a review from anyone who actually watched it. I was left with far more questions than answers. No logical plot line and when I thought I saw a glimpse of one, it vanished just as quick. If you ever get recommended this movie, DO NOT LISTEN. IT IS TERRIBLE."
" A fantastic directorial debut from Robert Eggers
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,8,"So I recently watched Robert Eggers directorial debut, the 2015 horror film 'The VVitch' and it was pretty good. I've been excited to see this movie for a while due to the critical and financial success it garnered in it's opening week, I never had a proper chance to view it until now and I can say that I am satisfied.
The film centres around a small family in the 1780s living in a cottage just off the edge if the woods where strange occurrences begin to happen to them and they have no idea what's causing them as they slowly fall into madness pointing fingers at each other. The story is simple yet effective, the thing that helps seperate this film from others that came out in it's time was how it chose to focus on the characters and how they are coping with the situation they find themselves in rather than placing the focus on cheap jumpscares and monster effects. The script really makes you invested in the story and characters to the point where I wouldn't even really class it as a horror movie and more of a fantasy drama.
Like I said this was Robert Eggers first time helming a film and I'd say he did a good job, the directing is crisp and meaningful with a lot of thought clearly put into it. The cinematography by Jarin Blaschke was by far the best thing about the film with plenty of intricate shots and moments that were rather ambitious in scale and I don't believe could've been accomplished without the combined efforts of both the director and cinematographer. The acting was great for the most part although there are some lines and moments that in my opinion could've been done better from the child actors in the film, that being said a lot of the time child actors really suck but these ones actually delivered a convincing performance. The music was great and really helped add to the creepy atmosphere the film was going for.
The primary problem I encountered from having a fully immersive experience was that the characters speak in a very old dialect that I found incredibly hard to understand even at full volume, I eventually had to turn on subtitles to just understand what was actually happening in I had to keep them on for the duration of the movie. No idea if it was just my tv and if i could have had a more fulfilling experience in a theatre, regardless it hurt my enjoyment quite a bit.
Overall The VVitch is a very well crafted piece of cinema from a director who clearly cares about his art. Not sure if I'll ever rewatch it or not but none the less I'd recommend it for it's fantastic presentation."
" Like watching corn grow
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,5,"If atmosphere is what you're after, however, I think you'll enjoy this piece. With great acting, excellent research into the background lore and Puritan beliefs, and very purposeful cinematography, this movie is truly blighted by it's ridiculous pacing. Lacking in any substantial scares, this is only horror in the broadest of terms, and as such cannot really afford the slow crawl at which the story progresses.Sadly, slow and meandering is what this film is all about. No matter how you spin it, this movie does little to engage you into the story, preferring to catch your attention with bleak visuals and atmosphere. If the latter is what you're looking for, then by all means go ahead. The film does have merit, but not as a horror film, and not as a great story for the ages."
" Folk horror.
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,10,"The witch is the Best horror film of this decade, an American-Canadian film about folk horror. Amazing cinematography and performances, a very cleaver script and direction. The locations are so beautiful and disturbing at the same time. A masterpiece of the 2010's, an art horror film by Robert Eggers. By the way, Black Phillip is a new horror icon."
" Great and could also be improved
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,8,"I was pretty blown away by this movie. Creepy , thrilling, clever. I wish there was something scary to see or more of a climax/ending. The lead up to the end was fantastic but I felt it was cut short. The family dynamics and the scene was very realistic. There was a lot of attention to detail. The movie left a few questions and it left me wanting more. They set it up nicely for a sequel. Like I said I would have really liked to see more of an unravel. Overall a very good movie."
" The Witch
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,4,"The Witch is... Interesting. The acting is ok, honestly I kept getting distracted by the script. The emotions were there but the dialogue just felt awkward and forced to me. It's also slowly paced, making the whole thing feel long and drawn out.Still, there are themes in here that I found relevant and poignant. The notion that with a single word, a simple label someone can be destroyed without needing the burden of proof.Still, themes aside, the movie is dull even though it tries very hard not to be. Perhaps that's the problem, it's trying too hard."
" WOW! That was intense!
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,7,"This movie The Witch was something I'm a little worried to talk about. For fear of saying the wrong things. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie, it's a movie that deserves attention. The thing is that this movie is so strange that sometimes it makes me wonder if that was the intention. Also something that really disgusted me was actually in the first fifteen minutes and that downgraded my score. The best [art of the movie was without a doubt the acting. When these actors act, they really act. It's a lot of fun to actually watch some of the sequences go down with these actors.Overall I did like this movie despite the fact that it was a little slow.7.5/10
B"
" Wonderful but not for everyone!
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,7,"I feel like this film is a different kind of horror than most people are use to with modern horror movie's because of that, I don't think this one is for everybody taste but regardless I really found this flim to be a impressive psychological horror flim that constantly makes you feel dread and doesn't rely on useless cheap jumpscares. I am not saying this movie doesn't have jumpscares but I feel like they were used very little and at appropriate times. Most of my cons with flim are minor. I do wish the movie was a little longer than it was and i think the ending could have been done in a different way. I believe this flim is good for only a one time viewing experience because after that watching
It second time didn't feel as senspenful But The actress who was playing Thomasin did wonderful job portraying her character."
" Boring, slow goes now where
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,4,"I had high expectations for this movie I don't mind slow burners like mother! Hereditary etc. However this movie just went no where it was just plodding along with nothing happening. The acting indo think was a plus on the movie especially the younger actors, however the story or lack of makes this movie dull and pointless. Watch a family praying, arguing and just boring pointless conversations, I kept thinking ok this is leading somewhere, it never did."
" Quite nice
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,6,"Low-key, artistic approach and good direction for a movie that doesn't add much but still stands out because average movies have become crap."
" Unbelievable
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie is the first and only movie that actually captured how i think it was like in the mind of the people that experienced Witchcraft (or believed to have witnessed it, if you don't believe in this kind of stuff) or had encounters with the Devil"
" Are You Serious!!!!
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,1,"Why?? And What?? I am a very big fan of horror movies. This seriously is not one of them. The ending is so disappointing that I cannot even explain. If you are a big fan of horror please stay away because you will waste precious time of your life watching this crap. I wish I have skipped watching it. Did not understand anything in this movie. Acting was terrible and story............well there is no story. I feel bad for the people who spent money watching it.
It definitely not horror not even close. After the movie is finished I made promise to myself that will never watch this production house movie again. A big mistake!!! Stay away....."
" A Disturbing Period Piece.
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,8,"By conventional horror standards, The Witch will fail to meet your expectations pretty much completely, but in exchange it will give you something far more special.A film that defies convention, a horror that does not scream for you to be startled, and a telling of a tale that so well encapsulates a time - a period - and its beliefs and fears."
" Pretty disturbing
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,5,"Disturbing story, if you have grown up inside a Christian Evangelical cult where much of the puritan beliefe system is still alive, and even more disturbing that the movie depicts the puritan scare propaganda about the devil as true."
" its a good film but hard 2 follow
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,6,"So im not the cleverest person in the world and this film is 100% a good film, has tension, artistic build, true 2 the time and the shots of the film are very well executed. but this film is definitely hard 2 follow haha ! ive been truna understand what their saying points and it can be hard i ended up getting up the synopsis of the film up and reading it as i was watching so i was able 2 properly understand and appreciate the film. but still this films whack definitely worth the watch 😂"
" These ratings make me question on rating system
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,1,"This movie is awful. It's nothing like the review I read in The NY Times. Some of the acting was good, parts of the movie were good but it unbelievable, NOT SCARY, audio was terrible with characters whispering lines so much we had to turn on CC. This might have been a better story if it was in a series. It was BORING!"
" Elements of horror with superb acting!
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,8,"Few horror movies actually scare me, and neither did this one. That said, it's an excellent period film in every respect. The superb acting stands out more than anything else, though.The lead, Arya Joy, is definitely one to watch for in the future! Clearly others feel the same way, as she's been in several movies since."
" Needs Subtitles
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,6,Visuals looked good. Storyline looked good. Beautiful actress. I had to give up on the film however because I was having such a hard time understanding any of the dialogue. The father mumbled. The children spoke in a heavy old world dialect. I needed a translation to know what was going on.
" Accurate but dissapointing
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,4,Religion stems from desperation but will always lead to madness
" Dreary drivel
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,1,More taxpayers money down the drain. Talentless self indulgent tripe with the usual anti-christian subtext. When did you last see a positive representation of a christian ?
" An expertly crafted unsettling picture.
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,8,"If you are into artsy films with solid substance, then you will appreciate this film. The Witch takes risks and succeeds on nearly every one of them. The unsettling and eerie nature of each scene gave me goosebumps. The score gives off a similar feeling that The Shining had, and it elevates each scene when it is used. The actors succeeded in being believable in the films dramatic and thrilling scenes, and the script asked a lot out of them. I cannot commend the cast enough for pulling off certain scenes. This film may disturb many people, and I would definitely proceed with caution if you are sensitive to religious themed horror.My only true negatives would he the slow start of the film and the rewatchability. It's hard to imagine myself going back to watch this film again because of the sheer unsettling nature of the premise."
" Impressive for a first movie
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,7,"Pros-
It's very well shot!
You can tell it was made by someone who takes period pieces and film very seriously.
The production design looked very convincing.
It's creepy!
All of the performances were pretty great, even the ones from the children.
The soundtrack was awesome!
There are some genuinely disturbing scenes that most mainstream films would be too scared to show, and that's something to be respected.
There are certain things that the film leaves up to the imagination, and it does it well.Cons-
There are some really bad lines of dialogue in this movie. When you hear them you can't help but say, ""How did you miss this?"""
" I'm impressed.
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,10,"After watching this film, I think this is the best horror film I've ever seen. I'm impressed."
" Creepy, Unsmiling and Intense
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,7,"The performances are what make this creepy little story worth the watch. Anya Taylor Joy is good as the hapless victim of her family's religious mania. The story unfolds slowly and intensifies as it goes on. Is it real, surreal or unreal? The Witch is well worth the watch."
" Talk About Old Schoo!
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,8,"Talk about old school!""The Witch"" is a painstaking recreation of Puritan life in New England. The lifestyle is mimicked. The clothes are period-accurate. The dialogue is actually based off of documents and speeches from that time. It's as if Mel Gibson decided to update ""The Passion of the Christ"" by 1600 years.As mentioned, the movie is set in Puritan New England as a family is banished from the larger community and has to make their own way out in the wilderness. As they build their home, strange things begin to happen, starting with the abduction of the infant Samuel. Things continue to get worse and worse, until... okay, no spoilers. See the movie.This is a dark and effective movie. I can't remember the last time I actually had a start from the all too often used jump scares, but the movie is absorbing enough that it did manage to ""get"" me a couple times. Robert Eggers seems to have kicked off a new wave in old-school, deep supernatural and existential horror. I won't lie that I drew some comparisons between this and Ari Aster's ""Hereditary,"" if nothing else than by simply the way the movie felt and left me feeling at the end.That being said, the film isn't perfect. In fact, oddly enough, it's perfection is what gives it imperfection. The period is so painstakingly recreated, in particular the dialogue, that sometimes hearing it can be jarring, making me stop for just a second to think about what was just said, which unfortunately interrupts the flow and managed to pull me out of the film. It's kind of a strange complaint that something could be so accurate that it fails to suspend disbelief, but here we are.""The Witch"" is quite an achievement and I'm glad that this film, which would otherwise be relegated to underground status, has managed to achieve a following, enough so that Robert Eggers got to do a follow-up with the Lovecraftian-looking ""The Lighthouse."" Definitely worth checking out."

" Interesting but the build up is more bust tha boom
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,5,Anyone that rated this film 10 stars must be from the 17th century. I will give the director credit for great visuals and dialogue. Story takes too long to build for an ending thats just Ehhh! Some cool scenes but overall disappointing. For me this movie is just okay and might as well be skipped.
" An astounding first film
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,9,"Looking back, The Witch seems to be at the forefront, if not the genesis of the current ""horror film as serious film"" resurgence we've been seeing in recent years (Hereditary, the Suspiria remake, etc.). One of the standouts from indie film darling A24 and the debut feature of Robert Eggers, this is ostensibly a classic horror story on the surface. It speaks to how few risks more mainstream movies in the genre are ever willing to take, and where they might go if they did (the answer: further, but definitely not as far as this). The Witch excels in all facets. The performances are pitch perfect, unnerving and believable. The cinematography is top-notch, using the natural light of a remote Canadian location to mimic the bleak New England we see on screen. Eggers is a perfectionist and it shows. Every shot and every piece of dialogue has been considered deeply. An astounding first film."
" Watched Three Times Now
",2019-10-18 00:00:00,8,"I first watched this film and felt let down. Mainly because I was expecting something more in line to the marketing material. I watched it a second time on Netflix and enjoyed it more. Now I've watched it a third time...
It's brilliant actually. It really is. There are so many movies that are like one timers. This was disguised as one to so many people but was actually damn good!!"
" Great horror movie with great ending
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,9,"This is a great movie from start to finish.It doesn't rely on jump scares as many recent horror movies, this is the type of movie that could be a book and still manage to be scary."
" Period piece horror is so much more unsettling and great!
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,10,"So glad I originally saw The Witch in the theater and now only seeing it for the 3rd time because Robert Eggers new film The Lighthouse is coming out very soon. Ralph Ineson is an exquisite actor with a very deep voice, he was perfect for this! Also Anya Taylor Joy is such a porcelain spellbinding actress! About the film though, it is spot on with the dialogue and one of the greatest horrors in the last decade! The style is so ghoulish, bizarre, beautiful, and immersive; not your run of the mill genre, quite unique and disturbing."
" My favorite horror movie
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,10,Cinematography was great on this film. There was a lot of nuances and use of suggestion in this movie which is a breath of fresh hair. I've watched this film 5-6 times now and notice new things each time.
" Bone-chilling
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,8,"The atmosphere of this movie is quite unique, the dialogue and accent of the actors really creates a mood that's inescapably creepy. You can only watch The Witch for the first time, once."
" Exceptional Horror; unsatisfying ending
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,7,"The Witch never failed to keep my attention and always seemed to work hard to keep the flow going. Every aspect and scene seemed to have a purpose towards the ending (except Caleb's sexually curious/ developing moments) and felt overall great. The film is horrific and works so well, being that there is practically no jump scares in this film (like 1 or 2) and its better that way.
The only problem I have is with the ending. The final scenes bring a huge build up only to drop down with a simple ending. That kind of ""what?"" or ""huh?"" kind of ending. It leaves you wishing that the filmmakers would have wrote it a different way. A more satisfying way.
Other than the ending the film does everything it intends to do and is very unique to other horror films."
" Don't listen to bad reviews
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,7,"This is a great movie, effectively chilling and disturbing. The cinematography is exceptional, the story is well written, and the dialogue is very realistic to that time period. If you don't like slow building horror, this isn't for you, but if you want something different than most modern horror, watch this."
" Captivating and unsettling
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,9,"Suspense builds constantly. Love the sharp lighting and dreary colour. It really started to get under my skin as it unfolded, and that's great."
" Don't listen to reviews!!
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,1,Just awful! Can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this. You will do the same and then the end will come and you'll be like huh? What?
" One of the greats
",2019-10-09 00:00:00,10,"I rarely leave reviews but this film is such an epic in the genre I wanted to give my two cents.
It is such an amazing film that I keep coming back to watch it again. Everything from the pacing of the film to the cinematography, to the story, is just perfect.I love the ideas, the language, the acting (especially Anya) and the slow eerie ness throughout the film. For a first major film from the director I don't know how he could top it in his career. A masterpiece in every sense of the word. Go and see it with an open mind and be transformed to the late 19th century of New England."
" Wtf!!
",2019-10-09 00:00:00,1,"Worst movie ever!!!
I dont know how some people rated it good!!!!"
" Perhaps the Best Horror Film of the Decade
",2019-10-09 00:00:00,10,"It's between this film and ""Hereditary""; the two horror films that I consider to be the best of the decade. What makes ""The Witch"" such a powerful horror film? In my opinion, it's that the scariest thing to happen in the whole of the film happens in the last few minutes, leaving the viewer with a shocking image that has such dark and grim meaning behind it, that it's nigh impossible not to be shaken and disturbed. I remember the first time I saw this film I thought it was great, and then I walked out of the theater and went about my day, but that final image kept creeping into my mind, infecting the dark corners of my room as I lay waiting for sleep. The implications of those last images are truly, in every sense of the word, horrifying, but more on that later; the rest of the film does an almost perfect job of building a world that feels infringed upon by evil on all sides, creating a place of apparent solace that is still rife with corruption. ""The Witch"" is about the infectious, parasitic, and sumptuous powers and allures of evil, and there's nothing more horrifying than that."
" A Truly Haunting Experience
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed the movie's slow-paced and haunting atmosphere. There are shots in the movie where the camera pans slowly towards the woods and the music heightens, before cutting to another shot. The continual occurrence of these shots builds tension up throughout the film, suggesting the ominousness of the woods and what resides within them. I also really liked the usage of Old English vernacular. Although it may be hard to understand at times, it really lends to the realism of the film."
" Occasionally spellbinding
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,5,"The Witch is truly spellbinding when it comes to cinematography and the use of sound. It makes you feel unsettled when nothing is happening at all. However, after it's over, when you start to examine the story and the characters, it all starts to unwind. It seems like an experimental film, intended to evoke emotion rather than tell a story. I'm not saying it's not effective, I'm just saying it wasn't for me."
" So much potential, so little commitment.
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,7,"This movie is quite removed from the traditional notion of modern-horror. The story takes place in the 17th century New England and follows the life of a religious family venturing out of their colony in search of prosperity. The movie does not use jump scares or other cheap forms of horror to achieve its blood curdling results. Instead it brings to life a complex historical mythology. The constant development of this mythology in the story works well in capturing the viewers interest time and again. With all of this said, the story does fall short in certain areas. The film's ambition is exciting to see, however, it comes up short due to poor acting in some parts and seemingly forced plot points. Had the film flowed more naturally from piece to piece it would have had an overall greater impact in its execution. The film tries to balance pacing with high quality cinematography and the results are accordingly underwhelming. If the movie had been stretched to even two hours, I believe the progression of events would have been magnificent. It is unfortunate to come away from a movie knowing that it could have been so much more than it was."
" Awful!
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,4,"Terrible film! So much potential to be a really effective horror but after the first few scenes not much really happens throughout the picture. There is a really unconvincing and weird 'possession' scene (which was acted terribly I thought) but other than that, it's more of a drama than a horror.
Don't waste your time if you like demon/witch horror films!"
" Highly overrated movie..Not worth your time.
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,4,Cannot understand what made the critics go Gaga over this..definitely can skip this .Too slow and not much horror in this.
" Pointless and boring
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,1,"Utter waste of time, a total insult to the horror genre or the psychological thriller genre or movies in general, a total waste of time of a movie, would get zero stars if I could do it..."
" Zzzz
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,1,"My god!, now this has to be the biggest disappointment of the year for me based on reviews prior to watching, just an awful awful attempt at suspenseful horror, the entire slow pace of the film leads to well..... Nothing!, its just a pointless movie..."
" Nothing scary about this
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,3,"You ought to read the high rated 1 star ratings. They do a fair and honest job. So, why 4 stars? A. Not easy to make a movie or be creative. B. There's worse.
Sure, it's better than the village. But that's like saying stepping on s*** is better than having it dumped on you. Few ppl are as overrated as Shyamalan. That said, this movie misses on all levels. It's not scary. It's not period interesting, there's no psychological depth like a secret window or exorcist 3.
All it does is build you up and leave you hanging bc there's no point to this stupid plot. If you like cliffhangers, you'd do far better with ninth gate.
If you like alt horror, check out ghost stories. But please be kind to yourself. Let me rewind your time and skip this flop...."
" predictable and pointless
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,2,"The ending credits of this movie cite folklore as the inspiration for what you have just seen, but that is a poor excuse for what the producers subjected the audience to.THE VVITCH is set in 17th century New England, and what the producers got right were two things: The language (Old English, requiring concentration to follow, but historically accurate nonetheless), and great cinematography.The story opens with a man and his family being banished from their village, seemingly for the ""crime"" of being openly Christian, then going through the struggle of survival living on their own, with only farming and hunting as their source of food. Their 5th child, an infant, is kidnapped and grossly murdered by a humanesque creature who is never full identified, but is implied to be Satanic in some form, and this creature proceeds to harm and divide the family.While the screenwriters may having been attempting to draw the battle lines between good and evil, they instead seem to go out of their way to criticize Christianity, and the role of man as leader of the family, both of which were common and the way things were three centuries ago. I admittedly got a chuckle out of the depiction of the wife as completely irrational and unable to be pleased (some things never change). But this was probably not the direct intent of the movie.To make matters worse, good dies and evil wins by the end of the movie, depressing the audience and making us wonder what we just watched and why we bothered to watch it.Furthermore, the implied references to the evil that Satan's minions do are cheap and stereotypical, from the highly sexualized little red riding hood woman taking advantage of the helpless preteen boy, and continuing to the surviving oldest child's being freed of religious bonds and drifting away in a sea of naked spirits at the end of the movie.This movie was hugely disappointing and insulting."
" Good, but a bit overhyped
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,7,"Sure, it's pretty. Sure, it's clever. But the ending was a disappointment and seemed contrived. In ten years, it will be remembered, if it is remembered, for launching a few careers."
" A Flawed but Surreal Experience
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,7,"This movie works very well as a very interesting retelling of societal fears that afflicted New England colonists. The Witch uses the extreme fears of our ancestors to craft an surreal and unique experience that can still be held back from its slow burn pace that can at times drag the movie down. Although, overall the movie is filled with very strong performances and direction and you should check it out if you can be a little patient for the main message of the movie to show itself."
" ""Must I Hear The Devil Wag His Tongue In Thy Mouth?!""...
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,9,"A colonial New England family is banished from their community, and heads into the wilderness to build their homestead and fend for themselves.When their infant son inexplicably vanishes, it's apparent immediately that something unspeakable has happened. Daughter, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) is held responsible for the child's disappearance by her mother, Katherine (Kate Dickie), though we know the horrible truth. With food scarce and the crops blighted, the family becomes increasingly desperate. When eldest son, Caleb goes missing, only to return in an altered state, the situation gets far worse.THE WITCH is set in a time when life was a continual struggle for survival, and superstition filled the air. The film is impeccable, capturing the look, feel, and language of the 17th century. The descending shroud that overtakes the family is like a killing fog, slowly choking out all light and life, until the brutal, frenzied finale. Highly recommended for lovers of slow-building, dread / paranoia-filled, supernatural horror films..."
" A boring and superfluous product
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,4,"This film isn't a horror but a mystery, because it can only scare children. The problem is that the resolution of the mystery is predictable from the first scenes. So it's a mysterious film in which, however, there's no mystery. So what kind of movie is it? Hypothesis 1: it's a documentary about a folk American legend; the most fake and reactionary documentary possible, because it represents like real bloodthirsty witches. Hypothesis 2: it's a nice style exercise, performed for authors and critics and not for the public; so anyone can see how good they are director, actors, director of photography, audio technician, costume designer, makeup artist, etc. (and they are really good), critics can praise the technique and cultural connections, and viewers can feel really disappointed."
" A disturbing and unsettling period horror film
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,7,"Any genre has all kinds of avenues to explore when it comes to storytelling. The setting alone can be a factor as to how a story will play out. Specifically period pieces. These types of tales can be a bit tricky to handle based on the accuracy the picture and the direction the narrative heads in. If there was a time though to focus on that was one of the scariest, it would be when witches were a big deal. Witch trials were a serious thing during their medieval times and onward. As soon as a witch was even spoken of, things would go south pretty quickly. People would begin having fanatic fits of hysteria and meltdowns, all to be sure such creature was never present. This is more or less what happens here in this uniquely horrifying film.The story to this film is about a family in the 1600s who is banished from their plantation after a religious dispute. After moving out and settling elsewhere, the family's newborn son is snatched away as to what was surmised as a witch. Fearing the worst, the family begins to suspect everything around them, including themselves. Writing and directing this was Robert Eggers, in his first feature film debut. Accomplishing this is not an easy task to begin with, which already is an impressive start. The script is simplistic yet effective in its story to show just how little is needed to make it good. One of the contributing factors to this experience is the atmosphere that is felt. Much of it is unsettling and ominous looking because of how secluded the location is.The cast are believable in their roles. Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), the first born daughter who witnesses her youngest sibling's vanishing gives a memorable performance. That and her chemistry with her father William (Ralph Ineson) and mother Katherine (Kate Dickie) are quite the struggle. Thomasin's other siblings Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson) are also perform well. Caleb comes in second to that of Thomasin for length of screen time. Both Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie were in the HBO series Game of Thrones. While Anya Taylor-Joy was in Split (2016) and Glass (2019). Bathsheba Garnett and Sarah Stephens who play the witches are quite unnerving to say the least and are very convincing.The minor issues in the story are the parts that are not explained. Some characters' fates go unresolved. Nothing is shown what might have happened to them. This is critical when it comes to showing closure in a story. The other flaw was the cause of the whole plot. As the narrative is executed, the thought of someone being a witch begins to surface. Yet it is never explained as to who was the witch, if at all. Understandably so there will be confusion, but also clarity should be brought to light on the inquiry. As for horror, there's only one jump scare and it doesn't even involve a sting which is great. The rest is unrelenting dread that is displayed. There is blood and gore but not much. It's more of the sense of being left alone that is more horrifying.Cinematography was well shot too. Handled by Jarin Blaschke, the camera remains steady and focused. Many times, the lens is aimed strategically at one place in order to cause unrest with the viewer. Blaschke also filmed for Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet (2009) and Fray (2012). Lastly there's the film score composed Mark Korven. The music heard is a mix of ethereal female chants, minimal strings and very light percussion. All of which present this story in such a disturbing way, it will make the audience feel like there really is something among them that is not right. Korven also scored films like White Room (1990), Cube (1997) and Cruel & Unusual (2014). Either way, it is simple for all the right reasons.Minor points like character resolutions and definite cause of plot is the only issue here. The actors give solid performances, the visuals are quite discomforting (in a good way) and the music is creepily memorable."
" Barely horror
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,6,Well filmed and good acting but this movie is not scary one bit and almost boring at that. Actors could be hard to understand at times when using super thick accents. I wanted to like this movie but it isn't as good as the critics made it seem. It's more historical fiction than horror.
" The Witch is that horror film that reminds you that Horror can still be an award winning genre.
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,8,"The Witch is just a great horror film. I loved so much about it. It has a great creepy feel to it, a dark evil vibe mixed in, and a touch of urban legend sprinkled on top.The film takes place in such a secluded location that it instantly gives you a feeling of loneliness and dread before it even unfolds its beautifully constructed storyline. I loved the plot, the timing, the acting... basically everything about the film. It's also a brilliant display of female empowerment, which is common among horror films, but in a whole new way that's different from the standard last surviving girl motif.Whether you're a fan of horror, or just great films in general... I highly suggest The Witch to everyone.A very strong and deserving 8 out of 10!"
" Soft Horror

" Egger's visionary old horror tale is a gem for the horror universe
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,8,"Eggers finally gives the universe of horror films a rare gem. An ancient gothic fairy tale, dark, ancient but not unprejudiced.
With ""The Witch"" you don't expect a conventional horror that overflows with blood or jumpscares.
The narrative rhythm is rather unconventional for a horror, but it is well suited to the universe that Eggers created and was able to draw and transmit with this film."
" An amazingly cinematic horror mystery.
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,10,I don't get why a lot of people didn't like this movie. It's not like the conjuring kind of horror. It's much more psychological and more of a period piece. how they spoke in old English really drove the tone of the story and the confusion of the characters in contrast to their beliefs was very believable. A really good watch for any fans of psychological horror.
" Cult of the Occult.
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,9,"The future of horror is here. Thy name is Robert Eggers. The Witch is close to being a perfect modern horror film. Reminiscent of classics from the mid-20th century, The Witch pushes the boundaries of what a film can accomplish, psychologically and visually, in scaring you. This is eye's wide open terror. You can hear it, you can smell it, you can feel it. Matched with performances that are all around breathtaking. Anya Taylor-Joy shocks the senses in her feature debut. Ralph Ineson as William is absolutely earth shattering. His booming, shivering voice praying to God for mercy will haunt you for days. The deeper we get into the curse of witches, as they inflict on this poor family, the darker and deadlier of a fate it becomes. None of us are spared either. Thomasin gives into the curse by the film's end, and by proxy, so do we all. In that sense, it's not as scary as it is hypnotic. But once you reenter the real world after your screening of The Witch will the dread of what you just watched overcome you. Boom. That's how you do Horror."
" A lot of slow build-up for no payoff
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,4,"I honestly don't understand where the hype for this movie comes from. As a depiction of Puritan religious hysteria it may be well done; for a movie intended to be entertaining, particularly a horror movie, it doesn't fare as well.I was aware the movie was slow going into it, but was expecting more of a buildup of tension. Instead, roughly 80% of the movie was a snails pace run-through of the characters squabbling with each other without making any marked attempt to really figure out what's going wrong. The only points where tension was built was when the musical score demanded it, as the characters themselves were unable to build up any sense of suspense. The witch that was shown didn't really help this as I found her to be almost comical rather than scary.The use of old English didn't help this feeling at all; I understand that this is meant to be a period piece, but the dialogue was too burdensome to contribute meaningfully to the feeling of the setting. It often felt like characters were rambling on with no proper point, using far too many words to convey meaning. This ruined any suspense they may have generated, and I don't know if the actors were good or not due to them having to slog through such dialogue. I may be mistaken with regards to how peasants spoke back then, but as an assessment of entertainment value the dialogue was purely negative.Additionally, the witch herself didn't contribute any meaningful or unique aspects as an antagonist in the film. She could have been replaced with a whole host of other villainous characters and the film could have been exactly the same, right down to the obviously evil children and unexplained, vague ending. If the film was meant to show how witches were perceived back then from a Puritan standpoint, I would've liked to have seen more of the witch side of things to make them more defined as an opposing force.Overall, I would not recommend this movie to those looking for a solid horror movie. If you're looking for a tense thriller without too much gore, 10 Cloverfield Lane (minus the final scene) or a similar movie would be more appropriate. For actual horror, a whole host of better, more interesting movies are available."
" Boring, predictable And annoying
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,5,Dialogue after dialogue after dialogue. Nothing interesting happens. Nothing you know already at the beginning.
" ""Be sober and alert. The devil prowls the earth.""
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,10,"Robert Eggers' ""The Witch"" now replaces my all-time favorite horror film (previously Robert Wise's 1963, ""The Haunting"" with Julie Harris, now a little dated). What the two do have in common is a literary-mindedness, fine performances, superior cinematography, and that which is new and strange, that is, nothing is predictable.In the case of ""The Haunting"" sexual repression, loneliness and maybe a psychotic heroine; for ""The Witch,"" sexual tension from single room living as well as a religious repression, a dark foreboding wood, and a landscape unfamiliar to the inhabitant, that is, a New World. In both cases, an ignorance that needs some kind of definition so fear/panic can be managed. Ignorance is usually at the heart of the supernatural, but both films manage to convince the audience there is some kind of actual unknown force threatening the characters.Eggers researched cases from the 1600's prior to the infamous Salem witch trials. Using court documents and lore, he's put together a convincing logic for what happens during the course of ""The Witch,"" whether it be contaminated food, starvation or isolation born out of new surroundings or expulsion from society.The spookiness creeps in slowly. The personality quirks of the family explain a lot. Never before have two ""twins"" been more cause for alarm than Mercy and Jonas and their ""pet"" goat Black Phillip.The use of archaic language both Christian incantation (and other darker forms of religion) really raise the hackles. When Mercy and Jonas taunt an untethered Black William (a goat) with repetitious rhyme, I wanted to flee. But family members are stuck with them, and tensions build in their new surroundings as various significant and insignificant mysteries begin, and alarm and panic consume the family where no one is trusted and blame comes quickly to the lips, causing more and more tension. As pioneers, they are living on the margin of survival, in and of itself terrifying.What happens in the wood is both beautiful and fraught. Jarin Blaschke's painterly cinematography draws us in to the drama, as does the careful costuming and production design. The film harkens back to the work of Carl Theodore Dreyer's 1920 ""Leaves from Satan's Book,"" and masterful exploration of occult throughout his long career.But it's the music that pushes this over the edge. Mark Korven's dissonant chorale and seemingly period instruments are as unfamiliar to us as the surroundings are for the family, driving us as mad as the fear that inhabits the characters.All of this is accomplished in an almost casual way. But slowly the injection of the unknown and fear of it, consumes us without the usual tricks that have become so familiar (and anything-but-scary) the many horror films that are cranked out by the industry. ""The Witch"" is different which is bold enough. But it's also accomplished in what it sets out to do and earns a very special place in the canon of horror films."
" Royal Garbage
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,1,"Anyone who says this film is good, must be an extremely boring and easily entertained person. From start to finish there are a total of ZERO scary scenes. Absolutely no explanation of plot and ZERO conclusion. A complete waste of time - creator wise & viewer wise. Take my word for it or you'll wish you would've - DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME. 0/10"
" ""The taste of butter""
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,8,"Straight to the point and intense until the very end. It felt like a cautionary puritan fable. A claustrophobic set, good drama amongst the characters and impending dread of what lurks beyond the tree line gave this supernatural(ish) movie an unsettling, viscerally scary feel. It also doesn't hurt that it was very well shot with haunting imagery. A good looking and efficient movie."
" A waste of time
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,1,This could potentially have been a good take on a well worn tale. The actors were wasted in a film that just never got going. Slow burner would be giving it far too much credit (no burner?). The reveal is underwhelming and the storyline is flimsy. Rubbish.All the natural lighting and technical stuff can't mask a dull film.
" Very unsettling, atmospheric horror at its finest
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,9,"Do not be fooled by the many 1 star reviews claiming this is not a horror movie. This movie is certainly horror but perhaps not for everyone. It has at atmosphere of dread and impending doom from start to finish. It is filled with superb cinematography and and disturbing imagery. As well, it offers a fascinating glimpse into the early New England colonist period. It's evident to me that the creators did their research when they made this unique masterpiece."
" Dark, unsettling, brooding. Well done and immersive.
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,8,"A genuine, new, non-stereotyped horror. With ""The Witch"" we finally get rid of all those horror cliches that dominated the genre during the last years: no jump scares, rivers of blood or disgusting splattery scenes. ""The Witch"" goes back to that movie school able to scare and upset just with the power of a great, solid plot and a dreamlike, suspenseful direction."
" Do not watch!
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,1,This movie is terrible. It is so hard to watch. It is actually painful! There is nothing good about it. It's not scary and is very slow moving. This is 1 1/2 hours you can not get back. Do yourself a favor and do not watch! I don't know what kind of people have liked this movie. That is scarier than this movie!
" A clash of conflicted ideas.
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,3,"I finally got to watching this movie after years of hearing about it, and I ended up very disappointed. I'll try to keep this review short, but it may contain a few spoilers. Also note English is not my primary language.To start with context, I'm not one for blockbusters, and I love slow burn movies who like to take their time in telling stories. I did not get into this expecting anything other than being along for an unsettling ride. And while I understand why people say it's ""deeply disturbing and unsettling"", it's mostly because of the setting and period this movie takes place in, not the plot.This movie has no idea what it wants to be. On one hand it offers a story with supernatural elements, and with the other it tries to show you how terrible living in a witch-hunt era was. While you can make a mix of both and get something great, all I found here were conflicting ideas that made the plot nonsensical.Thomasin is the eldest daughter of an exiled puritan family, with who we're supposed to relate to and feel bad for. Her family constantly blames her for everything bad that happens to them while it's never really her fault, and it gets to a point where they think she's a witch. Of course, this tears the family apart in a bloody fashion. Here's my main issue with this movie: if The VVitch was purely a period piece, I agree, it would be absolutely terrifying.But it's not precisely for one thing: it clearly has supernatural elements to it which point towards there being an actual Witch, with actual powers, among other things. The plot of the movie is being moved along by supernatural elements (baby kidnapped in a second, eldest son possessed, evil devil goat, etc) which cannot be explained with logic. Knowing this, you expect the movie to go somewhere with it, have some kind of reveal of sorts.That never happens. It just fixates on this family tearing itself apart for fear of witches, which do seem to exist, but then never develops on it. It's almost as if the original idea was for it to be entirely a family drama, a period piece in which you see how scary being a woman back then was for fear of accusations of witchcraft (which would have been a great horror story IMO), and then some dude in a suit came in and said ""but what if we put an actual witch in it?"". The big problem with this is that it changes the paranoia of witches, the whole center conflict of the plot, into an actual threat. We go from terrifying paranoid reality to science-fiction with evil demons. The family ends up being justified of being afraid of witches after all as they are shown to be real, which made me unable to sympathize with characters, especially Thomasin. Instead of rooting for her, I spent the whole movie waiting for the reveal that she (or the twins) were actually witches.Which never comes. And when the credits rolled, I was just left with tons of unanswered questions and a big feeling of ""that's it?"".All in all, it's a big pseudo-intellectual piece of great cinematography, and it is only praised by the numerous fan theories that try to fix the incredible amount of holes in its plot. ""Head-canon"" does not suffice to elevate this movie. I give it 3/10 just because of the directing and acting which is really good, but in my opinion the movie is not worth your time. But seeing all the 10/10 reviews online, I guess I just don't ""get it""."
" Slow Burning Horror
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,8,So if you're looking for a stereotypical horror film that has plenty of jump scares and over the top blood this movie is not for you. Where The Witch pulls it's horror from is how little it presents. The unsettling location for 95% of the movie takes place makes the characters and the viewer feel isolated. It's beautifully shot and the natural lighting adds to the gloomy setting. Where the witch scares you is building up this very unsettling feeling and sense that something is wrong and concluding with sharp and sudden visual horror that will leave a mark on you.
" Tense and atmospheric, The Witch is a period piece that inhabits the ideas of the time, for better or worse
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,7,"The Witch is a slow burn that pays off with a shocking but gratifying ending. Prioritizing a clear establishment of family dynamics and religious ideas over plot machinations, Eggers creates a movie that is challenging both to watch and stop thinking about. Taylor-Joy is as excellent in the lead as I would hope, and the cinematography and music really put the audience in a creepy, anything can happen mental space fitting for the witch-fearing setting. The primary focus is on Thomasin's development, as she is used or mistrusted by all of her family. The fear of witches does make it clear how people are eager to find a scapegoat and how the family falls apart so quickly as bad things start to happen. The ending where the goat talks and she goes to join the witches was extremely well done - she had played her part as a proper daughter and everything went wrong, so when she is finally free of obligations with her parents dead, she decides to see what lies on the other side. It's a dark movie and leaves plenty of questions unanswered and open to interpretation - what exactly happened to Caleb? Did the mom or the twins do anything wrong? Are the Satan people/creatures real, imagined, or inhabited by his spirit? As a story of Thomasin's development and family struggles in the time period, it's a good one, but so much of the evil is uncertain. That may be an intentional choice - nobody knew anything or had more than suspicions and fears in the 17th century, so this is a folktale playing off those ideas. It succeeds in its main focuses and brings that dark, heavy atmosphere in spades."
" Really well done
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,7,"Great commitment on the director's part, though for non-fluent English speakers, its quite hard to decipher. Otherwise, the movie is great, the music in particular."
" Just.. What?
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,3,What the......hell. I mean literally. It was a kind of hell to watch it knowing it would end like that. Meaning like nothing
" Nothing flashy. Solid directing and performances.
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,7,"Synopsis: In 1630 New England, panic and despair envelops a farmer, his wife and their children when youngest son Samuel suddenly vanishes. The family blames Thomasin, the oldest daughter who was watching the boy at the time of his disappearance. With suspicion and paranoia mounting, twin siblings Mercy and Jonas suspect Thomasin of witchcraft, testing the clan's faith, loyalty and love to one another."
" How does this get such high reviews?
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,4,"Looks good, sounds great but really dull and does not make much sense!"
" A good idea that went off the rails in a weird way
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,5,"Going in, you don't know if there's a witch in the woods or if being seven people--two adults and five children, two of whom are twins and just ugly little brats--all alone in an isolated location with literally nothing to do but work and pray to a fearsome god is simply driving them all mad. Strictly within the context of these people, in this script, religious insanity would be plausible to the point of obviousness.The only thing more obvious would be--an actual witch. That answer is also less creative, and frankly, a lot less interesting. At least the way these writers handled it.I give it five stars out of ten because it's half good. The acting, dialogue, sets, music and cinematography are all wonderful. And I do realize that cinematography is usually the Miss Congeniality of the dog show, but it's worth noticing in this case. The creepy shadows, low light, and authentic candles/candle lamps are exceptionally effective.Up until the completely stupid last couple of minutes (there's a great ending place the filmmakers breezed right past; SPOILER: it's before the goat starts talking), I'd have recommended it for the visuals alone."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,5,This movie was good at times but I was unsatisfied overall. beastly acting. great directing and tone-setting. had a psychological aspect. a well-made movie. also dragged at times (1 viewing)
" Not your typical everyday horror movie
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,9,"The Witch is a very different type of horror. I'm saying this now, NOT EVERYONE WILL LIKE THIS FILM! In a world where we're used to films that rely heavily on jumpscares, The Witch goes on a more psychological route where it doesn't use any of the modern-day horror tricks like loud noises or jumpscares. This is what makes it very conflicting for the audience. For me, I found this technique highly effective.As a huge fan of the horror genre, I haven't seen a horror film which is so capable and insanely crafted like The Witch. This is the writer-director Robert Eggers' first feature film and I could tell he has a lot of talent. Each and every shot is handled so meticulously that I'm surprised that this is Eggers' first movie. Eggers really cares about this project. From the colour scheme, the costumes, the lighting to the atmosphere. All of this became so important to make the audience feel like they're in the 1630s. The attention to detail fully immersed me to this world. The decision to make everyone speak in the Old English language further enhanced the realism and brought you even closer to the characters and atmosphere.The acting by everyone involved was perfect. The way everyone spoke and emoted felt so real and so believable. Each performance was strong and felt like this was a real family. This aided me into believing all the events that take place over these 90 minutes. The script is thought-provoking and requires the audience's full attention to understand what's happening. A core element in a horror movie is the music. The Witch has such an uneasy and terrifying background score that adds to the atmosphere.I loved the way the makers portrayed the Witch in this film. Despite not showing the Witch much, you still sense its presence terrorising the family allowing the film to become more unsettling. The only problem I have with the film is its pacing. I felt it was a bit too slow. However, the film's harrowing atmosphere and characters made this feel like an experience like no other.As a debut, I have immense praise for Robert Eggers' take on the horror genre and look forward to his future projects. As mentioned before, The Witch isn't for everyone. This movie is made for horror and film lovers who appreciate the craft that goes into creating a movie as well as understand what true horror is."
" A fascinating story full of symbolism and diabolical horror.
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,8,"This film presents us with an extremely disturbing, dark and depressing story, based on popular tales and legends, it is a horror story carried out in a different way than what we are used to. The Witch is not a movie for just anyone, it is not a quick horror movie or random jumpscares, it establishes itself as the narrative of the sad fate of a poor family as they are harassed by the evil powers of an outside witch.The film is filmed in a beautiful way, creating fantastic images that get stuck in our minds, but above all, full of symbolism and icons that present us with constant subconscious ideas to build the story they are trying to give. The performances are fascinating and make us see the real panic within the characters, even the performances of children are quite solid. The direction is fantastic, the scenes are dark, medieval and cold, giving a strong feeling of desolation. With a fantastic script, it makes us see through the eyes of the poor victims of this story.The Witch is a strong film, full of very incredible and spooky images, concentrates mainly on a very strong subject which is witchcraft and the powers of hell, teaching us the horrors that these entail, however, in a magical way and yet realistic, raw and sincere, without over-explained fantasies or effects. And it doesn't need explanation, that's what this movie is about, to face the horrors of powers that go beyond our understanding, our power and our mental health. Probably one of my favorite horror movies, a perfect movie for those seeking the ''special touch'' in the over-saturated genre of terror. Fascinating.''Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?''"
" Boring but story is good
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,2,Movie is boring at most parts. Story is good. Casts are great. If you really want to see a horror movie that will scare you then I do not recommend you this movie.
" An autopsy of our ancestral fears
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,8,"This film is excellent! The photography, the costumes, the sets, the actors, the fearsome soundtrack of Mark Korven, the mesmerizing voice of Ralph Ineson and the dialogues are irreproachable. The atmosphere is deeply dark, desperately cold and deliberately slow. It takes place in New-England, a few decades before the well-known trial of the witches of Salem in 1692. A must see. 8/9 of 10."
" Absurd
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,3,A ridiculous film with a ridiculous ending. Besides good pictures and sounds I cant say that this movie successful and the story was pointless.
" Horror for Historians (in a good way)
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,7,"This is not a horror movie by modern standards. There's no gore, jumpscares, or set formula of cast or events. It is, however, a work of art well-cared for by its creators. The setting, costumes, acting, writing, and directing make for a film firmly set in our very real history, with people's very real fears and anxieties manifest beautifully in a tense, dark atmosphere.
This film hit me a certain way that others may or may not experience. I'm an avid amature historian, with an upbringing with both devout Christianity and a mentally unstable (sometimes abusive) parent, so relating to the characters' plights, especially Thomasin's, came easily. The characters were well written and shaped, and all of them seemed to have an important place in the story. Except maybe Jonas. He didn't have much screentime or development, but whatever.
The writing is excellent, with perfect period dialogue and well-paced scenes, though the overall story did seem a little rushed, and the last scene was just a bit too out there to mesh well with the rest of the film. The costumes were perfect, and the monochrome motif of the film didn't feel forced or exaggerated. None of the film did, really. It just flowed it's own way, not worrying about being too action-heavy or scary. Certain scenes were disturbing, but didn't overstay their welcome, and things weren't spelled out for you at any point. It makes you think, it makes you wonder why, how, and what.
There's not a lot wrong with this film, except for it's misbranding as a horror movie. Yes, technically it is horror, but it's a calm type of horror that you often don't see anymore. I think that is what really threw people off and gave it a bad start with its audience. This kind of film isn't for everyone, but it certainly is a gem to the crowd that can appreciate the dedication that went into it."
" The Witch - a Minimal, Haunting, Thriller
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,8,"Horror movies, often associated with jumpscares, possessions and demons, can feel cheesy, attempting to scare the viewer at every turn. Unlike these films, Robert Eggers The Witch, instills fear in the audience with his depiction of an old witch, hidden in the woods and attempting to undermine the main characters. A concept simple in ideation, but in execution, Eggers knocks it out of the park with his minimalistic style and focus on the effects the witch has upon the mentality and outlook of the settlers.
Using the folklore from the 17th century, Eggers builds the story of a family of settlers, expelled from their religious plantation over a dispute. The family moves into a clearing far from the plantation and along the edge of the woods. Their family continues to grow as William (Ralph Ineson) and Kathrine (Kate Dickie) have yet another child to join their existing four children, the oldest being Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) followed by Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and their twins Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson). Thomasin is sent to watch the child while her family works around the home, during her game of Peek-a-boo with the baby, she opens her eyes, only to reveal the baby has vanished. The family is plagued by paranoia, the loss of their beloved child sends the family into a downward spiral, flinging accusations at each other, playing directly into the witch's hands. The witch slowly tears away at the family's bond and shreds the last strands of faith they had in their religion.
The minimalist approach Robert Eggers took to film this movie is one of the key reasons I can watch this movie over and over. Eggers took such a natural approach, only using the natural light from the sun and moon as well as candles to help reinforce the setting in the 17th century. The constant use of single subject frames and centered shots makes us viewers feel that our characters are all separated from one another, they have lost their connections to each other. The slow separation of the family grows as Thomasin is followed by a wave of misfortunes, she's the only one who knows the truth, but the family will never believe her after she let their newborn disappear.
Sound design, and particularly the musical score, in The Witch is terrifyingly magnificent. The witch uses the family's baby for a ritual, gruesomely churning the child into a gory mush, but as she's quickly using her staff to grind the child into a bloody paste, in fades a quick humming sound, playing at the same tempo she seems to be mashing with. These eerie stringed instruments fade in, as it slowly zooms in on the witch, the music slowly climbs and climbs in volume. The scene changes, but the sound of her pounding away continues as we see her rubbing the poor child's remains across her naked body. Choir singing starts to fill the scene as the sound continues to build in complexity, it grows and grows, aiming to reach a climax but never finding it as the screen goes black, the sound cuts, and we're thrust back into the lives of the family.
While this movie is certainly a fantastic example of horror without the overuse of clichés, It seems less scary than I expected it to be overall. It has a fantastic ability to build tension, but if they had been able to use the gore the same way it was used in a movie like Hereditary or even take notes from The Blair Witch Project with how they dealt with an unseen evil and using its violence to more effectively instill fear in the characters rather than just having gore with little impact.
Even with slight drawbacks, The Witch is still a paralyzing movie, mesmerizing the viewer and drawing them in with its fantastic approach to filmmaking and focus on building immense tension in simple spaces. It has such an emphasis on atmospheric pressure from the setting surrounding the family and kept me locked in my seat for the entire movie, anticipating each interaction and ultimately had me wanting to watch it again as the credits rolled."

" God, Devil, Psychological Terror
",2019-05-22 00:00:00,10,"We all have our vices and hot-buttons. In the horror genre, I find the most fertile ground remains the push and pull between God and the Devil.It's also the most challenging and ambitious field to plough, as films such as The Exorcist and The Omen have commanded top billing in this pantheon for a half-century and counting.Imagine, then, the thrilling shock of discovering the film The Witch toying with the idea of competing with those cornerstone films on their own turf. Beautifully shot with coldness to the cinematography that perfectly suits the harrowing subject matter, this is a claustrophobic film in which feel isolated and cornered despite taking place in the middle of nature. We feel the mounting terror of the characters; a natural reaction, surely, when Beelzebub is systematically and incrementally messing with you as he closes in, and just because. This is nothing short of one of the greatest horror films made."

In my humble, unimportant opinion, this ""film"" was just a study in the evils of religion, whether it's puritanism or present day evangelism. Long story short: religious fanaticism and some old hag in the woods destroy a family. Yay. Other reviewers have said it has psychological terror. I didn't see it. I did experience boredom. Also, an evil goat!! Maybe I've seen too many of these so-called horror movies. Maybe I'm too picky. However, if you call something a horror movie, it needs to scare people. I don't care what manner it employs, but it needs to be scary. This was NOT psychologically terrifying. Had I stayed awake, I might have laughed instead."

",2019-05-11 00:00:00,10,"That's one of that rare films that makes you glued on the seat more and more the film goes on, the atmosphere is terrificly fascinating. if you want something more than a jumpscare film go watch It.
Personal advice, go find about some trivia about the film before watching It... The trama is based on old kids books or something like that"
" Classic ""waste your time"" 2019
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,1,"The only thing you don't have control of is time. You do have control over how you spend your time though. Don't waste your time watching this, you won't get those 93 minutes back. Take 60 seconds and name all the things you can do in 93 minutes and do that instead."
" Perfection
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,9,"There are few movies which effect such an overwhelming sense of absolute dread. From the beginnings of the film, as the settlement gates slam behind the family, there is no mistaking, all is lost. I had the same""cover your eyes"" stirring as with The Shining. High praise from me. The emotion will linger long after the credits."
" Music is the best thing in this movie
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,2,"Waste of time. No plot. Music is good. Can't understand the actors, I know it's supposed to be time period but I cantith understandith them. I wouldn't even use this as a torture method because they would fall asleepNo witches at all only 2ish parts."
" An instant horror classic. 'The Witch' is meticulously crafted and gets under your skin
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,10,"'The Witch' is a film that stays with you. Upon first viewing I was a little bit underwhelmed by it but I must say it got under my skin and I kept thinking about it's creepy imagery. I think we are living in a very good time for horror films and 'The Witch' deserves to be heralded as a key piece in this horror renaissance. It's success stems from it's consciously constructed leisurely pace. The entire film is grey and overwhelming. The big scares don't come as jump scares per say but rather they unfold, ( a great example of this is when the boy Caleb meets his fate in the woods)It's a thematically interesting movie too. Our lead character Thomasin endures abuse and disbelief from her family when things go slowly awry. She is an innocent likable character who is believed to be evil because of her becoming a woman. The religious commentary is strong too. One gets the feeling that the sense of doom is more palpably a result of the puritan views than the witches lying in the forest. The ending is spectacular and unsettling. You almost have feel catharsis when you see Thomasin give herself to Black Phillip.Highly recommended"
" Oh hell yeah!
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,10,"This film scared the hell out of me. The acting, the writing, the pace, everything was done to perfection! One of my favourite horror films of all time. Highly recommended!"
" It's professional and distinct enough to be worth your time.
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,7,"Above average period chiller with a vivid sense of place and time where a family is trapped on all sides by the elements.Not terribly accessible with its Jacobean dialogue (apparently its very authentic but I wouldn't know) and it almost gives the movie a comic tone but the substance shines through very disquietingly.There's none of the bluntness and obnoxiousness that you might get in movies like The Conjuring, where sudden blasts of strings ruin what might have been a good reveal.We just gradually find in god's country forces that appear to be unholy (see what I did there?), captured in an unrushed, flavoursome, culturally rich fashion.Maybe it drags in parts but overall this was refreshing, especially its folksy yet chill music that uses a variety of neat instruments and is a long way away from the blandly generic scores we're used to."
" Greatly helped by subtitles, Best Horror Movie of 2015
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,10,"This would make a perfect companion-piece to Arthur Miller's The Crucible. The classic American play suggests the only witches were in the minds of the participants; this one, let's just say, goes in a different direction. Subtitles allow us to hear the hushed Elizabethan conversations - a real weakness in the theatrical showings was that you couldn't hear most of the dialogue. This is a bone-chilling analysis of an outcast Puritan family and their gradual destruction by, yes, witches. A major breakthrough in the horror genre, it would take a couple of more years before Hereditary came along to give us another."
" Production is good, however no plot
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,2,"The only reason I'm rating it 6 is its production, the atmosphere and a different sort of horror it made me feel. Yes, the movie is different. There is no plot you might wonder wth is happening and the end might not make any sense to you either."
" Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,10,"Maybe not a movie for everyone if you don't like the classic horror or the classic jumpscare infested movie. However, this movie is to put it simple- A piece of art.This movie takes place during Pre Salem time. Based on documented events and court trials, it's scarily accurate. The way they speak, dress, act- I absolutely love the historical accuracy of this film.
The movie is about a family representing all that is against the church at the time- they are all sins and none are completely innocent. It's about a family coping with loss and coping with the issues that a modern family might have- Such as sibling arguments and the idea of not having a means of living- or money for most of us. This movie puts up a very long build-up, suspense filled and to those who might not be very artsy- slow and possibly annoying.
But I simply loved it. The actors are perfect for there roles and uncomfortably chosen too. The cinematography is something else as well, with shots that are hard to explain or shots that are beautiful and light on the eyes, really quite enjoyable. Another note that some of the scenes may even require research to understand such as the beginning scene with the baby due to its historical accuracy, which to me is just more fun... But maybe not for others who just want the plot shoved down there throat.Anyway if you're not into jumpscary stuff- Don't watch this. If you're feeling kinda artsy and into something thats accurate and kind of beautiful, I'd watch this. Really an awesome movie :)"
" A lot of hoo-haa for nothing
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,5,"Don't get me wrong there isn't anything actually wrong with this movie.... is just has the devil inside it... jk.
The true problem is that it's essentially just a lot of unsavory crap stretched out o over the course of a feature length movie without anything to learn, without any payoff, without any actual story.
""a folktale""
You know what those have in common? They are short to tell and are interesting. Qualities this movie lacks.With the characters all equally hateable, the plot practically non-existant, the visuals forcibly off color, the conclusion deeply unsatisfying and dumb, i think the people working on this did the best with what was available.
What was available however was... not much. And definitely not enough.
The acting was pretty great from all involved, but acting out a dumb script doesn't save the movie. And the script was also as good as it could be adapting the stories it did.
Maybe they should not have been adapted at all?It was a perfectly functional movie, with a lot of effort, and well made, it was just not nice to watch in any way, from any perspective, be that family drama, horror, medival movie, religious movie, or folktale as it were.""Witches, in any case do not exist. They shall not be spoken of again."" is something a king said in the early middle ages ending witch trials in his kingdom before they could really start. In this case the latter part of the advice could have been heeded and it would not have been a significant loss."
" Don't waste your time. Rewatch the conjuring instead.
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,2,"This honestly was probably one of the worser movies I've seen in a very long time.They chose to write the entire movies dialogue in old English, which is great for authenticity, but hard to follow, hard to understand, and they took it a bit over the top with all the ""The, Thy, hithers, and thous"".The entire movie had no plot. There was no conflict of why whatever is happening is occurring, there wasn't any sort of big picture reveal, or evidence of something more occurring. It was just like ""Watch this family not like each other, oh and yeah there's a witch somewhere in the woods.""We were trying to watch a creepy horror movie. This film was 90% drama and nuisance and 10% horror. You see like 3 scenes that have the witch that are somewhat creepy, each one only lasts about 10-20 seconds (if that). Then it's over and that is legitimately all the scary parts of this movie. So if you're trying to get into horror, and you want to ease in without too much creepiness, well I guess this movie would be for you."
" Young but very influential horror film
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,10,"A24 is a fairly new studio, but it didn't take them long to start building a fan base. The VVitch (the first film from Robert Eggers), is an extremely thrifty yet singularly terrifying period piece that scored big time at the box office and scared the bejeezus out of several film goers. The truly unique thing about this film is that it's only been out since 2015 and it's already had quite the influence on several other A24 films; most notably Hereditary and It Comes At Night. This satantic chiller is destined to get you sleeping with your lights on..."
" Effectively Creepy
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Sets an effectively creepy tone with its washed-out visuals & minimalist score; the cast, costumes, & production design plunge the viewer head-first into the world of the film, but the ""conclusion"" (as it was) felt a little flat."
" Slow, slow and slow
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,4,"The premise of this movie was very intriguing to me, and gave me a very ""the village"" vibe. Yet as I was watching it I found myself getting very bored with the slow pace of the movie. The second half of the movie does pick up the pace a bit, and the ending is the best part of the film. And although I found this movie boring plot wise, it does do a good job of making the movie feel real and accurate to the time period. All and all this movie looks good and is an accurate depiction of the time period, but I personally found it to be boring for the first two thirds of the movie."
" best horror movie of our time
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the coolest movies made, period - let alone horror movies. The ambience created by the director is pitch perfect. You truly are transported back to that time of colonization, religious fervor and fear of the unknown. It's a stunning portrait of early America, of what our forefathers had to endure - especially the women. Overall, this is a feminist masterpiece - of one girl's journey to single-handedly defy the patriarchy. Yes, it's gruesome and ferociously evil at times, but hey, aren't we all? Overall, this is a gorgeously shot, directed and conceived film. Can't wait for more from this director."
" A must watch for fans of horror/suspense movies and good movies in general
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,9,"Loved it. Ive seen quite a few horror movies in my day and this one takes the cake. It has great nerve racking moments, good pacing and decent characters. Whats not to like?"
" Fairly Disappointing
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,5,"If you want to watch a movie about a desperate family falling apart in the colonial era, then this is your movie. This movie is not about the witch - in fact she seldom appears. The movie kind of rolls along in a predictable way and then ends with a very linear story line that has little to do with witches. Great context for a story but not very well executed."
" Unconvincing but still Brilliant
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,6,"Loved the acting especially William ( father) have done a great job. Cinematography is awesome, plot, clothes, accent and lighting. You gonna love it. But it frustrates you that the continues prayers by the family are doing nothing for them, God is sleeping cold, it will make you a disbeliever. On the other hand evil is not stopping at all. It feels like there's no God but only evil. They begged for Mercy throughout the movie, but God didn't helped them, it's very disturbing!!"
" Don't see it
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,1,"It's the worst movie i watched ever
Just I wasted 2 hours for nothing!!"
" Nice watch but not really scary.
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,8,"Feels very authentic (well to me anyway but how would I know, I'm 20th/21st century), but not really scary, more unnerving and the ending is way overrated."
" Won't recommend
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,2,Very very very slow can't even explain. Big waste of time.
" Unengaging
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,4,"I found this more annoying than scary. The ending is painfully predicable within the first ten minutes and once you have guessed it then the rest of the paranoid mystery leading to it is boring. The music that they use to imply witches is beyond annoying, it really grates on your ears. The acting is solid and it looks beautiful. There are some intense moments but this is let down by unengaging scenes, painfully slow pacing and a total lack of anything happening. I didn't like the stuff involving children, even knowing it is fictional I knew that it had to be acted and that really did not sit well with me."
" Beautifully made film that's not interesting.
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,4,I was told I'd enjoy The VVitch because I enjoyed Hereditary. Bad advice. This movie was far from enjoyable.The cinematography is wonderful but it doesn't make up for the weak and uninteresting story. The VVitch feels misplaced as horror and is more of a psychological drama/thriller (with very few thrills).4 stars for great cinematography.
" Horrible overhyped movie
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,1,Not the least bit scary or terrifying. Artsy fartsy mumbo jumbo. Don't waste your time.
" What?
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,1,Filme sem pé nem cabeça. Probably a junkie wrote this movie
" IMDB has completely devolved into fake reviews
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,7,Well shot and fairly well acted. Not scary and should not be a critically acclaimed movie getting perfect 10s on here.
" More disturbing than scary
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,7,"This is an old tale, and one well done. It starts out strong, and works it's way up in horrific scenes. The music is distracting but probably the scariest bit, getting you tense. The ending wasn't my favourite, but all in all, it was unique and well acted tale, but creepy story. Do not watch if children in peril bothers you!"
" Terrible movie
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,4,"I was eager to watch this title, and very dissapointed with the whole movie. The plot is somehow lost and the characters look weird.
There is a bit of suspense and the sounds are ok, but I was hoping more."
" Bad!!!
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,3,"I normally only rate the movies but this one is so bad that this is a warning!
It's one of the worst movies I ever seen and that is an accomplishment in itself. But the script and the acting is dreadful. I considered to stop the movie many times but I've read good things about the movie beforehand so thought it would redeem itself but it didn't!! Stay away!!"
" To much Hype
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,1,I rad the Reviews by the pros and was excited to see this one. Disappointment was on a grand scale. If I save one person from wasting time on this Melodrama. Here goes The Goat is the Devil and everyone dies.
" Underwhelming
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,3,"Having thought the Witch having potential given the content and overall story. After watching the film, was left dissappointed and somewhat underwlehmed. The film isn't nearly as horror or thrilling as lead to believe, and at times the pacing is very much slow. Quite boring at some parts. Though the set and visuals is well done, the story is quite simple and nothing too bizarre occurs.With some decent scenes, though the film does get betterafter its mid-way point (around which Caleb- the older brother enocounters a witch then later dies whil being ""possessed"" and ""spirited"" surrpunedd by his family).Much of the dialogue is quite different to understand given the accent and dialect, which is better to watch the film with subtitles on. Assumed there would be more jump scares or thrills but for the most part, the Witch was quite tame.Besides a few killings (one by their devil black goat named ""Black Phillip"" and another by its lead Anya Taylor-Joy to her mother- in a casual and predictable manner). A lot of religious undertones are present in the film"
" Takes a particular type of horror movie to scare me but...
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,8,"This one The Witch at times left me feeling quite uneasy. Don't know if it was the slow pace at which the story line developed or the gradual disintegration of the family unit by way of such extreme malevolence forces, a force that so determinedly took hold of a family. The helplessness of viewer who could clearly see and realize that there was going to be no escape that there was going to be no sudden reprieve for the family only added to the utter level of foreboding that carried right through the movie I thought it was great but seriously disturbingthe poor souls obviously having means of defense against"
" A Good, Unscary But Flawed Horror Movie
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,7,"22 May 2017. It's odd to hear a variation of musical strains from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) used in this horror movie instead of a ship floating along the surface of the moon or surrounding a dark, black monolith, but it's there. This movie has the raw and grittiness of The Name of the Rose (1986) and The Revenant (2015). This movie rather being so much as a scary, horror movie is more of a serious religious family drama with periodic insertions of the occult. It doesn't quite have the intensity nor creepiness of erotic horror film Under the Skin (2013) or Siren (2016) nor the more compelling story of Black Death (2010). The ending is also odd in that it doesn't really seem to flow naturally from what went on earlier in the movie, almost as if it was tacked on at the last minute to include some sort of dramatic ending."
" An amazing atmospheric film.
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,9,"This is a personal favorite for me since they're is so many great and amazing elements. The gritty and New England feel, the ominous and creepy atmosphere, the way they spoke felt so real and it was like I was watching something like The Revenant (2015). The acting is perfect, the scary moments were terrifying. That includes Caleb's death, the Black Philip scene where he reveals himself as the devil, the end scene, and EVERY TIME THE WITCH WAS ONE SCREEN. SHE MADE ME LEGITIMATELY FEEL SCARED OF HER. I LOVE A HORROR MOVIE THAT CAN REALLY SCARE ME AND AT THE SAME TIME BE DONE IN SUCH A UNIQUE AND CREEPY WAY! However, because of the way they talk it's not always easy to understand, which is the movies only problem. Either way, this movie was great. Strong atmosphere and scares. 9/10."
" This movie is a research project
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,9,"This is one great movie, but it is not really a classical horror film with cheap thrills or jump scares. Rather, it is a much more serious exploration of all things related to the witches tale, from the folk stories to the very medieval mindset that gave rise to Salem witch hunts and the consequent atrocities. This is a work of love, and a product of years of very elaborate and tedious research into the historical context and origins of the concept, and the frame of mind of Puritans that made their primitive prejudices possible. The movie also skillfully touches on the related widespread folklore, that gave rise to the stories from brothers Grim to contemporary Disney rendering of the witches universe. But though there are many layers of interpretation of the movie, it is really in essence an exploration of the primitive Puritan imagination, that made supernatural interpretation out of even the most mundane occurrences, let alone the unexpected ones. This is the place filled with ominous witches, where sin is rampant, where Puritan oppression - sexual and otherwise - can find outlet in fantasy, leading to atrocities and abuse of all sorts. And this is the true horror, the truly scary thing about the whole thing. For, the medieval puritan mindset of New England and their folk tales of witches might be things of the past, but bigotry and close minded stupidity and prejudice are alive and well, especially in America. Salem witch trials and executions are long gone, but bigotry still gives rise to savage acts in the name of ""spreading democracy"", ""fighting terrorism"" or ""communism"", and to the unchecked USA atrocities all over the world. The origins of this horrifying, bigoted mindset are well explored in this movie. It is not supernatural elements that are appalling, but the palpable reality of human stupidity and wickedness of the nature of humans and their ""righteousness"", that is really the root of truly sublime horror."
" I do not recommend
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,3,"Definitely, this is not a horror movie. The action is quite boring. However, I appreciate clothing and features of the 17th century."
" It may not be for you
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,4,"I don't hate it; I don't think it's a waste of time, but here are some things to consider before watching it...
Is it something new? Yes. Is it tense? Yes. Does it have good ambience and acting? Yes.
Is it as good as everyone says? Definitely no.The plot of the movie had potential to grow strong, they just didn't execute it right; the movie gets longer as you watch it, not exactly boring, just not intriguing enough.
The main reason why this isn't enjoyable (for me at least) is because you wait the whole movie for something interesting to happen and it never quite gets there; there are 2 or 3 strong scenes, a bit of tension in them, but they do not do much in favor to the rest of the film.Maybe I got my hopes really high or something, idk the hype was big. It's not a bad movie, it kinda depends on why are you watching it. I'd say for sure it's not entertaining, maybe for artistic points of view."
" It was okay.
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,6,"The cinematography was good, the acting was fantastic, and the music was okay. And that's what this film is: okay. I enjoyed it and was entertained to a certain extent but I felt like it needed more. It was just tension building to scenes that didn't really pay off. Nonetheless, this film was worthy enough to watch."
" Absolute garbage.
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,1,"Do not waste your time with this movie.It has no purpose, not proper plot building, very weird and completely self-destructive misdirection of plot points (trust us, it's not what you think it is *obvious wink*), and literally no reason for anything to play out the way it did.And the ending makes zero sense after everything else that happened in the movie.Avoid it, and never look back."
" Não gostei.
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,2,"Que final ridículo. O filme todo um suspense legal, mas o final foi idiota."
" Was expecting great horror but what a let down.
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,3,"I was looking forward to this. At long last a great horror that will keep you on the edge pf your seat...or so I thought. Wrong.The good points: the first 30 minutes was good, the natural lighting was great, the look of the film was authentic and acting excellent. That said the main problem with this is the pace, slow and dull, and I mean SLLLLOOOWWW.Luckily I could fast forward the long boring dull bits otherwise in a cinema I'd have walked out. It's more a pretentious religious docu-drama with a touch of supernatural thrown in rather than a ""horror"". A classic? 10 out of 10? No way!! Would I watch it again? Nope."
" Worst. Movie. Ever.
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,1,"This is 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. The ""scariest"" part is the goat. Even worse than Batman vs. Superman. No idea why it's rated so high"
" Wish I'd liked it more...
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,6,"Saw this long after the hype train dragged it to death for a few years, really wanted to like it more. Good mood and images for the most part, but really not much story and really no actual scares."
" slow and boring
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,2,"Ostensibly a critique of exaggerated Calvinism (who gave us the total depravity of man) it renders God and Christ impotent while supporting belief in the power of the devil (a goat becomes a man). Why would the young girl Thomasin want to become a witch after they killed her 2 brothers and father? I found the movie neither scary nor haunting, certainly not enchanting."
" A VVell-Meant VVaste of Time
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,4,"VVhile this movie might have better production value than your average student film, it is in no vvay as intelligent nor as engaging as one vvould hope. The characters are largely stereotypical of the average modern person's understanding of the time period, and are also insufferable (especially one in particular who only ever vvhines and flies off the handle in every single scene). I get that it's trendy to exaggerate historical Christian paranoia nowadays, but A) This depiction of it vvas vvholly unbelievable and inaccurate to this type of scenario, and B) The paranoia in this movie clearly isn't baseless, so the message fails anyway (not that vve get to see much of the evidence of the paranoia being baseless mind you, because that vvould be too exciting).The movie is filled vvith long sequences of a character slowly vvalking from one side of the screen to the other, painfully melodramatic outbursts that drag on vvay past the point of credibility, and creepy music that dramatically builds up to accompany... nothing at all happening. This is an annoying movie made vvorse by people's recommendations of it.In terms of meaning, this movie is a confused mess. It vvants to scare you vvith actual vvitches because vvitches are scary, but at the same time it vvants to make a point about religious paranoia and misogyny because vvitches aren't real. But also vvitches are real in this movie, but also they're not. Nothing matters in the end, vve vvill all float on, roll credits, enjoy disappointment.Kudos for at least researching the setting a bit though. Most period pieces of this genre vvouldn't bother."
" Just superb. Highly Recommended.
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,9,"My Rating : 9/10I love the 'darkness' of this movie. It's unique and so much fun to watch it unravel in the climax. The Witch is slow-burning, not exactly horror in the 'jump-scare' kind of way but it has it's moments of Satanic imagery which are equally powerful.An atmospheric thriller/horror. Much, much better than 'Hereditary'."
" Unrealized potential
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,6,"I was really excited to see this movie and sadly disappointed when l finally did. The acting and the cinematography was fantastic but the story was weak, confusing and didnt really seem to go anywhere. In fact it didn't really seem to tell a story at all."
" Chilling slow burn horror chamber piece carefully balances psychological and supernatural horror
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,9,"Set in 1630s New England, a family that's been shunner by their community over a religious dispute is forced to move far into the forest on their own. The film is told from the perspective of the eldest daughter, Anya Taylor-Joy in a standout performance that's also her film debut, one day is watching her baby brother who mysteriously disappears before her very eyes. It's revealed that a witch has stolen the unbaptized child for a blood sacrifice. At that point, the family begins to suspect one another of consorting with the devil and practicing witchcraft, which is where things begin to unravel. First time writer/director Robert Eggers has made something of a minor masterpiece with this slow burn horror film that never quite comes out to explicitly state whether anything supernatural is happening or if it's all in the paranoia imaginations of it's characters. This isn't to say the film isn't scary, because it's scary as hell. Although not a standard jump-scare horror film in manner of ""The Conjuring"" or ""Paranormal Activity,"" Eggers delights in slowly building tension between characters and peppering it with some truly haunting and chilling imagery. When Taylor-Joy's younger twin siblings befriend a goat named Black Phillip, hold onto your horses! There are few films I would visually compare this too (Dante Tomaselli is possibly the only current horror filmmaker I might compare Eggers visual style of horror). It's shot primary using natural lighting and the camera is largely invisible in that it doesn't draw attention to itself with showy pans or zooms. It's primarily frightening and chilling static images that stick with you, whether it's Black Phillip striding through the forest, a red cloaked raven haired beauty becoming the viewer closer, or some of the more overt horror images I won't spoil here which may or may not be hallucinations or dreams. Eggers has stated the film is based on folktales, fairytales and written accounts of historical witchcraft, including journals, diaries, and court records, with much of the dialogue coming directly from these primary sources, which gives the film a sense of authenticity that's missing from many period films about witchcraft. Witches have long been a horror film staple, but they rarely come off well. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is likely the best film about witches and like this film, it rode a delicate balance between supernatural and psychological, but no film about witches has better captured the folktale/folklore elements of witchcraft than ""The Witch."" The silent film ""Häxan"" may be the only other film I can think of that possibly captures this period feel, but that silent film documentary style was quite different from a narrative form of storytelling. In ""The Witch,"" the imagery of a black goat with a broken horn, all the talk of ""signing the book,"" different animals which may or may not be familiars, talk of a witch's teat, or the plot point around an unbaptized child all feel straight out folklore and effectively tap into primal audience fears. The film also greatly benefits from a truly remarkable score by composer Mark Korven, who creates an unsettling dissonant soundtrack using a minimalist approach. Korven actually built his own original instruments to create some of the frightening and original sounds used for the film's score, which makes the soundtrack to ""The Witch"" one of my most favorite film scores in years. Overall, ""The Witch"" is not a standard horror film that will appeal to your average Fangoria gore-hound, but is more of an arthouse horror film for horror fans who appreciate a slow burn horror style of filmmaking that takes its time to build character and tension."

" The Witch
",2018-11-08 00:00:00,7,"I must have heard about this scary movie, based on Puritan folklore, during the time of its release, I knew it got positive feedback from critics, and I'm glad I got the opportunity to watch it on television, it was broadcast on Halloween night. Basically set in the 17th century (the 1630s), a New England family: William (Ralph Ineson), his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), teenage daughter Thomasin (Morgan's Anya Taylor-Joy), young son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and twins Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson), are banished from a Puritan plantation over a religious dispute. Near a large, secluded forest, the family build a farm, there Katherine gives birth to a son, Samuel (twins Axtun Henry and Athan Conrad Dube). One day, Thomasin is playing peekaboo with Samuel, during which the baby suddenly vanishes without trace. It is revealed that a red-cloaked Witch (Bathsheba Garnett) has stolen the unbaptized Samuel, that night she kills him and uses his blood and fat to make a flying ointment. A devastated Katherine spends the next few days crying and praying, while William insists it was a wolf that took the baby away. Katherine forbids the children from going into the forest, but William takes Caleb into the woods to lay a trap to catch an animal for food. Caleb asks his father if Samuel's soul will go to Heaven, William disciplines Caleb for asking this question and later reveals to his son that he traded Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the missing cup, and implies that Thomasin was responsible for Samuel's vanishing. After the children go to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family. Early the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to check the trap in the forest, she threatens to wake up their parents unless she goes with him. While walking in the woods, they spot a rabbit near the trap, suddenly the horse Bert panics and the dog Fowler promptly chases the rabbit, Caleb runs after them, while Thomasin is thrown off the horse and knocked unconscious. Caleb gets lost in the woods and stumbles upon the dog's disembowelled corpse, going deeper into the wood he comes across a hovel, a beautiful young woman (Sarah Stephens) emerges from it and seduces him. William finds Thomasin and takes her home, Katherine is angry at Thomasin for taking Caleb into the woods, while William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherine's silver cup to save Thomasin. Caleb is found outside in the rain that night, naked and delirious from an unknown illness, when he wakes up next day, he vomits a bloody apple, Katherine believes this to be witchcraft, Caleb passionately proclaims his love to Christ before he dies. The twins then accuse Thomasin of witchcraft, their older sister had previously teased them pretending she is a witch, so she retaliates and tells the parents that the twins were having conversations with Black Phillip, the black goat. In rage, William puts both Thomasin and the twins inside the goat house, boarding it up, he plans to return to the plantation the next day. That night, the elderly and hideous witch enters naked into the stable and drinks milk from the goats, the twins and Thomasin are terrified. Katherine has a haunting vision Caleb holding Samuel, in it she takes the baby and breastfeeds him, this is fact a dream, it is a black raven pecking at her bare and bloody breast. William wakes up the next day to find the stable destroyed, the goat mutilated, the twins missing and an unconscious Thomasin with blood on her hands. As Thomasin wakes up, the black goat starts charging at William, impaling him with one of his horns. The commotion wakes Katherine, she is unhinged and blames Thomasin for all the recent tragedies that have beset the family and tries to strangle her, in self-defence Thomasin kills her with a billhook. Alone, Thomasin enters the stable and urges Black Phillip to speak to her, the goat appears to ask her if she would like to ""live deliciously"", then transforms into a tall dark man. The figure orders Thomasin to remove her clothes and to sign her name in a book that appears, she says she does not know how to sign her name so Black Phillip helps her to do so. Now naked, Thomasin follows Black Phillip, back in goat-form, into the forest, she sees a coven of witches holding a Witches' Sabbath around a bonfire. She joins the coven as they begin to levitate, laughing and convulsing, Thomasin goes catatonic, and ascends above the trees, disappearing into the darkness. Also starring Julian Richings as Governor and Daniel Chaudhry as the voice of Black Phillip. Taylor-Joy gives a terrific performance as the adolescent going through many emotions brought on by horrific incidents, Ineson often does TV voiceovers and is impressive as the put-upon father, and Dickie does well also. This is not necessarily a terrifying watch, there are no real jump scares, it is certainly tense, with some darkly strange moments, while the use of drab colouring, and the choral score by Mark Korven add to the atmosphere, and the themes of grief, suspicion and hysteria work well, it is a most interesting alternative kind of period supernatural horror. Very good!"
" As a horror fan, One of the worst movies I've ever watched.
",2018-11-08 00:00:00,1,"I can't believe there are people that liked this, but no one gives 1 sigle argument why they liked it xD, It's HORRIFIC! but not in the good sense, it's extremely boring, there's no witch, there's no horror, and there's almost no talking, and the little of talking is about crazy parents mistreating their children, till the end of the movie I was wondering, and??? when does the horror come??? or is this just a mute drama??? and... IT WAS JUST A REALLY BAD DRAMA MOVIE, 1/10, It's not a horror movie, it has no genre actually, I can't give it 0 but I would give it that score if I could, 100% BAD.Waste of time."
" What do people see in this?
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,1,Literally the same psycho jesus loving ultra praying religious cult in the forrest horror movie with no real action and just a BUNCH of uncatered suspense that goes nowhere. Especially with child roles we have developed no real attachment too. Overrated steaming pile of hot garbage with alot of unnecessary and completely out of context and volume totally uncontrolled kids high pitched screams. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who literally told me they wanted to be bored for 90 mins. I'd still pick something better for them. Watch something less dry and hacky. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. BORING.
" ""who be the witch of the wood?""
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,9,"A triumphant debut for director Robert Eggers who crafts a terrifying exercise in slow-building horror with The Witch, perhaps the year's most daunting watch.The story centers around a family in 1630s New England as they are haunted by supernatural forces such as witchcraft, black magic and possession. The first thing Robert Eggers successfully establishes is the setting from which this takes place. An unbelievable achievement in what can only seem like the 17th century, the filmmaker captures not only the tone of such a life but incorporates a script that breathes a Shakespearean essence which further elevates the drama and heightens the horror. The Witch invitingly creates such a dreary and desolate mood that often times feels suffocatingly unbearable and yet remarkably compelling, it is as if the film itself uses supernatural forces to allure you, but that's just great filmmaking don't worry. The cast here are impeccable, consisting of only 6 actors, they immediately set an emotionality that will secure your investment for the rest of the running time. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are veterans who never miss a beat, even with terrific child actors lead by a superb newcomer, Anya Taylor-Joy, who perfectly seizes the accent and blend moments of drama with horror.The Witch is immaculately constructed, with exquisite performances and a haunting tale about the decay of a family corrupted by the witches of the woods, no pointy noses or crooked hats in this one however."
" i witch i never viewed this

" Excitingly Original But Aurally Challenging.
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,7,"This is a creatively fresh entry into the all too frequently cliched horror genre. I thoroughly enjoyed the acting from the small main cast, the original storyline and the historical authenticity brought to the production. However this high regard doesn't extend to the supposedly seventeenth century English dialogue spoken by the characters. I've generally got a pretty good ear for English dialects, but have to confess in this film I only understood around about 25% of what was spoken onscreen. It wasn't just the dialogue itself. It was also the rapidity and pitch with which the words were enunciated which annoyed me. I really would have preferred to be reading sub-titles and since I wasn't watching a DVD, this wasn't possible. It's a pity, because apart from this and the somewhat over-the-top conclusion, which didn't really seem to fit with the ambiguous nature of the rest of the picture, this was a pretty interesting offering."
" A good horror movie
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,7,"The Witch is not your typical horror movie with jump scares and such. It is slow-paced, but it doesn't matter to me because I was captivated by the beautiful setting and camera works, the characters and the story. You might also need a subtitle here because the characters speak in Old English, as the story is set in 1630s."
" The Witch slowly engraves its illustrious witchcraft into your mind.
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,7,"Not the first time I've watched this slow burner, and quite controversially I did not enjoy it. A couple of years fly by (faster than an old hag on a broom, might I add) and the film community ever increase their adoration for this horror. Did I miss something on my original viewing? Turns out, I did. A separatist family are banished over a religious dispute and encounter evil forces in the woods that seclude their New England farm. Surreal imagery provokes the inevitable question of ""is it real or imagined?"", and Eggers' directorial debut opens an ominous window into a period horror that transcends its own art form. Accompanied by Blaschke's stunning cinematography, Eggers directs you gently through this New England folk tale that, whilst not genuinely scary, provides a thick layer of uneasy atmosphere. The biggest complaint that is commonly thrown around is how ""boring"" it is. I implore you to grant this beauty another viewing. The pace, particularly during the first and third act, was consistent and well constructed. Balancing a thematic narrative that perhaps hosts too many metaphors, with illusory imagery that enhances the chilling tension that is substantially more effective thanks to Korven's score. No, I suspect the largest hurdle to bypass is the dialogue. Utilising a more unconventional 17th century dialect that, whilst feels freshly authentic, hinders character investment. It's difficult to quantify this choice as a detriment or a blessing. It does visualise the hysteria that culminates from devout Christians, and the fear of sin or corruption if individuals stray too far from the word of God. But due to Ineson's deep voice and Dickie's heavy accent, it is more often than not difficult to fully comprehend the dialogue. Fantastic performances though, but it just somewhat loses its edge with the dialect. I'm still indifferent about the ending, doesn't feel satisfying enough with its ambiguity. Still, I have to say that this is a gorgeous supernatural period drama that perhaps is too unconventional for most audiences."
" Wickedly good stuff
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,10,"There are multiple interpretations that have been offered on this opaque masterpiece, but the one I like most is that the piece is an example of a group hysteria that goes really badly wrong, or at least it's too simple to just blame the nymph-like beauty at the heart of the film for being 'a witch all along'. She actually comes across as the most saintly character up until the denouement. In the meticulously crafted dialogue of first-generation American pilgrims one becomes immersed in the wierd mindscape of 17th century Puritans, where there's an unflinching belief in the supernatural - be it heavenly or hellish... Somehow the horror seemed just so much more genuine here than amidst the usual comic stumbling fiends that make up the stock of the tired genre.. Anyway I loved it from start to finish, and felt such a transgressive kick, a liberated feeling becoming involved in a vicarious way with the goings on. One witnesses in subtle symbolism and audacious moments a bit of everything from murder to incest, suppressed greed & vanity, obsession in bucketloads, pubertal lust, love mingled with hate, hopes for salvation meeting fire & brimstone, to name a few. And it was all so much more pointed and realistic in the austere, sprititalised and just plain paranoid setting that the director so painstakingly creates. This is far too clever and too serious to be pidgeon-holed as 'horror'. It's more of a psychological thriller with buckets of blood and bible-talk. And the suggestion online that the whole family were all hallucinating on the ergot from rotten corn is way too delicious an idea to dismiss outright."
" Makes that Demi Moore 'Scarlet Letter' look like 'Citizen Kane'
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,2,"I'd waited to see this for a while and it was Film4's big Halloween night film, yet there was absolutely nothing scary or spooky about it - it was just pretentious and thunderingly dull.Essentially it's the 1600's, a family has been shunned from their community (no explanation given for this), they move to the woods, everything sucks and the family bickers and moans while inexplicably dramatic music promises 'oh blimey, something bad's about to happen!' but there's nothing, things suck a bit more, the end.It felt like someone with unmedicated ADD made it as there's so many things that seem to be leading somewhere but then they're abandoned. It ended pretty abruptly and it's almost like they chopped off the original ending or something.If I'd paid to see it I'd have walked out and asked for my money back. Not seen something this terrible since 'The Autopsy of Jane Doe' (I reviewed that on here if you're keen to avoid another stinker)"

My brother liked it, though. But its been proven time and time again that he makes bad desicions. This was no exception."
" Just plain amazing
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,10,"It all starts when William's interpretation of the New Testament leads him to being banished from the plantation where his family has moved to from England. Instead of the safety of being around others, now he and his brood have to live within the forest.One day, when the oldest daughter Thomasin is playing with the youngest, Samuel, the baby disappears, stolen by a witch and devoured. William insists that a wolf stole the child while his wife is decimated for the rest of the film. William's lies move the story further in motion - he takes Caleb hunting deep in the wood when he has promised his wife he would not and he sells her father's cup for hunting supplies. Meanwhile, Mercy and Jonas, the twin children of the family, insist that they speak to the goal named Black Phillip while contending with Thomasin that they are also witches.The next morning, son Caleb leaves to see if he can get food for his family, thereby keeping them from selling Thomasin into servitude. She goes along with him, but their dog chases a hare and their horse throws Thomasin as Caleb is lost in the woods, eventually being seduced by yet another witch.Soon, all Hell is literally breaking loose. Caleb returns, near death, and throws up an apple before his violent death. The twins forget how to pray and go into a trance. And the mother is convinced that Thomasin is behind it all.Up until this point, the film moves at an incredibly slow pace. Get ready. I don't want to spoil anything, but it gets more and more demented, paying off everything you've been waiting for.The first film for Robert Eggers, this shot in natural light film is something to behold. It seems much more confident than a first film would suggest. There is also a lot of attention paid to supernatural detail, such as the Enochian language used throughout for the witches.I've debated the end of this film so many times. Is it about Thomasin's escape from teen to full womanhood? Is it the sin of William's pride destroying his entire family? Is it about the fact that evil actually exists and that it may claim even the most pious? Or is the issue that William only sees the hellfire and brimstone of the Gospel when he should be preaching the literal Good News, the celebration of Christ conquering death? Would Thomasin desire to live deliciously if her life had not been so oppressive? Is it about the divide between mother and daughter? Is it a Satanic parable?"
" This Would Have Been A Better Horror Movie Without The Supernatural Angle
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,6,"At first, I thought this was going to be a kind of a rehash of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village."" It does sound very similar: a group of people living at the edge of a forest in primitive conditions start to believe that there's something in the woods out to get them. In this case, they believe there's a witch, or even the devil. But, although this has more of a supernatural element than Shyamalan's movie, in some respects it also has a more authentic feeling.This movie really is set in the 17th century. An apparently strict Puritan family, recently arrived at a plantation colony in the New World from England, is banished from the colony because of their religious beliefs. They take up residence in a clearing, with only themselves for company and without the protection of the colony, and with the dark and mysterious forest right beside them, and tragedies start to befall them almost immediately - beginning with the death of the infant son. The family seems divided into various alliances, for lack of a better word: mother and father, older brother and sister, and younger brother and sister. All of them are impacted by the baby's death in a variety of ways, but it's the eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) who becomes the target. She had been caring for the baby when it disappeared. Gradually, as things continue to spiral downhill for the family, Thomasin is suspected of having made a deal with the devil; of being a witch - with results that are ultimately tragic.There is an authentic feel to this. There were fears of witches in the early-mid 17th century, and especially in New England. There were isolated families, in a strange new land, not knowing for sure what lurked in the forests that weren't very far away. Many were hyper-religious. They were inclined to see Satan at work when hardship befell them. They did turn on each other - many of the ""witch"" accusations that were made in the era were started by children making up stories that got out of hand because the adults took them seriously. So I actually could buy into this story. I actually could feel sympathy for poor Thomasin as the accusations against her from her own family spiralled out of control. And the performances in this from everyone really were very good. In addition to the sympathy I felt for Thomasin, I was intrigued by the character of William, the father (played by Ralph Ineson.) Yes, he was a strict and hyper-religious Puritan, obsessed with sin and fearful (or at least uncertain about) his eternal fate. But there was also a strangely compassionate nature about William. He did love his family - often very tenderly, kind of turning the traditional stereotype of the strict Puritan father on its head. It was a very good performance. I thought that director Robert Eggers also did a very good job. The movie was filmed in a very isolated location in northern Ontario, and Eggers used the location to great advantage, right down to using only natural lighting, which added to the atmosphere of the movie. He also insisted on using English actors, supposedly so that the accents would be authentic - notwithstanding the fact that the English of the early 17th century probably had a different sound than a modern English accent.And yet, ultimately this disappointed me. The story does, in fact, go for a supernatural ending, as Thomasin, who emerges as the last survivor of the family after killing her own mother while her mother was trying to kill her, does in fact make a deal with the devil (who's represented in the movie by a black goat the family has named Black Phillip.) Ultimately, she ends up joining a coven of witches deep in the forest, with the last scene showing all of them levitating. Perhaps this may seem strange, but I thought that last scene weakened the worth of this as a horror movie. For me, the actions and thoughts of real human beings are far more chilling than supernatural silliness, and the horror of this movie was really the slow buildup of paranoia as we watched the family turn on each other, blaming each other for things that could well have just been natural tragedies. No devil or witches needed, in other words. The ending came across as just silly to me, and detracted from rather than summing up everything that had come before.But that last scene aside, I can't deny that I enjoyed this movie. It was a reasonable look (the ending notwithstanding) at something that could very well have happened in that era and in that context. (6/10)"
" Worst movie ever

" Very well done horror film

",2018-10-19 00:00:00,5,"Um... what?Seriously, what was that? I liked the look of the film, I liked the tension and startling music, and I thought the acting was good, especially the young man that played Caleb! But what was that story? Really? I almost fell asleep at the half hour mark, even with the loud musical score! By the horns of Black Phillip, I have not a clue as to why I watched this 'till thee end. Grr..."
" Good but not scary 😡
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,7,I just watched this last night and I likeed it. It was dark and creepy but not as scary I thought it would be. I saw it on Netflix so it might have been tamed down a little. I wish we could have seen more of the witch and Black Samuel. Worth a watch but look for a Director's Cut or unrated version.

" Decent Film
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,2,"I realize that everyone may not agree with my review, but I thought the acting was good, the plot was good, what I did not like about the film is that I do realize that this is suppose to take place a longer time ago, but the parents in this movie are so ignorant to their children, I realize also faith has alot to do with this film, but the parents are almost borderline idiots, about everything they do during the film, all the decisions they make and what they say is just so unbearable."
" A slow-burner that will work for some, but not all
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,7,"I recently watched The VVitch for the first time, after having heard great things about it for some time. Albeit, this was a very unusual film, and one that I grappled with for a little while to reach a conclusive idea of my final thoughts towards it. As the directorial debut of Robert Eggers, The VVitch (as it is stylised in the promotional material) is a film that germinates in your mind and leaves a stronger lasting impression days after watching more than it leaves an immediate one.There is a great deal of subtlety that is utilised in this movie, and it is from the age-old concept of the 'fear of the unknown' that the film finds its niche. However, where the film has and will likely continue to divide some audiences is in its presentation. This was a remarkably bleak looking film, full of greys and darker tones; with not a skerric of any real colour to be found. By design, it is a washed-out looking movie. Set in the 17th century with a recently banished lone Puritan family at its centre, the movie is meant to present the hardships and blandness of that era and it does so by its choice of colour palette. The use of Early Modern English in the dialogue is another talking point. The use of this style of language will be jarring to some but it works effectively enough in the context of the film's setting, and apparently, at times was plucked word-for-word from local journals recovered from that period. While each member of the cast does a great job making it feel genuine, there are moments where it feels as if the archaic dialogue gets in the way of plot and character progression.This movie is the definition of a slow burn, having more in common with The Babadook than The Conjuring. Anya Taylor-Joy turns out a wonderful performance and is convincing in her role as the family's eldest child, who questions her existence as the family question their faith. This is a difficult film to recommend and is an atypical horror film, designed to creep under your skin than to shock outright. It is one more in line with those from the turn of the century."

" Bored...confused...
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,2,"I finally saw this on Netflix, and the best thing I can say is I'm glad I didn't pay money for this. It was supposed to be a horror, but there was nothing scary about this. I am a horror film fanatic, and was hyped bout this when I first saw the preview; but now I feel like that is 1.5 hours of my life I will never get back.Where the time period is always an ideal era for a good horror film, I found the movie lacking as a whole. The dialogue was fantastic (I'll give you that: the delivery of old time English was very well) but I feel maybe they spent so much time trying to get the dialogue right that they missed many grand opportunities to take the movie further in the scare factor. With many plot holes, the movie just led me in a confusing circle. 
 The whole premise of a family that chooses exile for their beliefs, striking out on their own only to (unbeknownst to them) fall prey to a coven of witches seems like breeding ground for thrilling effects and damaging faith searching. Instead, the characters seemed to really take all that away.The mother seems to hate her own daughter, for whatever reason we don't know (it does mention in the end about Thomasin trying to seduce her brother) but it seems to have been a deep rooted hatred. The father is in constant denial that anything evil is going on. Though he is strong in his faith that God will help them, I feel that he is constantly dismissing the notion of evil lurking literally outside his door step. He goes so far as locking his remaining children in a barn with a supposed evil goat that just randomly shows up. Thomasin is, of course, the heroine in the movie. You want so much for her to vanquish the evil witch and be able to save her little brother and sister; only to be disappointed that she joins the coven of (unnecessarily) nude, floating witches led by a transforming goat that, I'm sorry, were those spurs??Where did the witches come from? Why did they curse the family? What was exactly the point of grinding up the baby at the beginning? These were only some of the questions I had while trying to decipher this film.My point of this rating is to share my views in this movie. I know I can't speak for everyone; I've seen quite a few high ratings for this. I for one, am not giving this higher than a two. But maybe it's just me. Hope this helps."

" Psychological masterpiece!
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,9,Rewatched the movie The Witch. I forgot how much I enjoyed that movie. The directing and cinematography are outstanding. You really get the feeling of religious paranoia and dread from the era. The entire movie feels like one long nightmare you can't wake up from. It constantly produces a feeling of dread and paranoia that keeps you on the edge of your seat.The set design was near perfect in every way. It perfectly captured how difficult it was to live in that time period. The film also made excellent use of sound to build up moments of suspence and horror. Overall a 9 out of 10.
" Time better spent shoving bamboo underneath your fingernails!
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,1,"Other than the fact the acting was good, this slow dredging of a non existent storyline takes an amazing twist of bull at the finale. Do not watch this, your life will be better for it. The premise of an early colonial settlement including the occult sounds like a valid horror movie. It is not, more than seventy percent of the film has no dialogue, it is just the actors walking around for extended periods of time with a musical cacophony that is too loud and does not add any viable accent to the script. If a reasonable person were to make a puppet show compared to this travesty, it would win an Oscar."

I was not scared one bit or even remotely scared until the end...when I knew the movie was getting close to being over and nothing scary had happened. Then I was like ""Oh please no don't let me have wasted all this time for nothing."" But alas I did waste my time for nothing.I have never seen a black goat like that. It was very pretty and almost human like. It doesn't seem like they treated any of the animals in this film humanely. I mean obviously they didn't kill them but having that goat pretend like he was gonna charge or when the kids were chasing it around etc...it just seems like those things would cause it distress.The little kids were cute and convincing but they don't seem to be acting anymore. Maybe after they made this film they were like ""If this is filmmaking then methinks I'll consider another line of work.""Anna Taylor-Joy has got something weird going on with her eyes that is distracting. She may or may not be a good actress but I don't know because all I can focus on when she's onscreen is her eyes and I find myself wondering how she keeps her eyeballs in their sockets because they are stretched at the corners to the point where it looks like her lashline is pulled away from her eyeball.The mom is really ugly and annoying. She only looks slightly better IRL and really the only terrifying thing about this movie is when you look her up on IMdB and see her yellow teeth. You're an actress and have got to have enough money to address that by now so why haven't you?!Why does Black Philip ask if she wants butter?! How bout ""How'd you like me to take this role off your CV and we can act like it never happened?"" Or ""Could I fix your eyes? Or how'd you like a hot bath with something to eat and a nice clean dress to wear?"" Instead he asks her if she'd like butter...um ok sure whatever. What does that even mean?!I hope that they used some type of body prosthetic for the witch because if that is someone's real body then that is gross.Are we expected to believe that this witch is gonna suck on that goat and it would just stand there and not be making noise?! That's unrealistic.And finally is the goal to fly when you become a witch? I mean living in the forest and being naked and covered in filth and being toothless doesn't sound like a good time. Aren't you supposed to want more than that. Oh yes please Satan I'll sign away my soul for that lifestyle...no thanks. I'll pass and figure out how to churn my own butter.Wish I would've watched something else."
" Outstanding! Unique and surprising.

" ""The Witch"": I gotta make a Switch, People
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,4,"I really need to start reviewing more comedies, man. Watching the downtrodden early American supernatural domestic drama ""The Witch"" directly on the heels of enduring ""Hereditary"" has damn near got me inserting my head into a blazing hot oven. And leaving it there.Well done movies, both. Yet there's only so much dismalness and despondency the kid can take. But if for some reason you ever find yourself yearning for an anecdote to joy...well you just have at 'em there, pardner.Killjoy."
" A disappointment with no point.
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,2,I didn't care for it.The actors that played the main family were OK but there did not seem to be much point to the tale. It did not seem scary to me but they used sounds to warn you when it was supposed to. I only gave it 2 stars since it wasn't the actors fault that it was not a good movie.
" Don't waste your time with this one
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,1,"The most utterly ridiculous movie I've seen in quite a long time. The madness culminates into absolutely nothing in the end and the viewer is left with only one thought ... And that is ""Please give me 90 minutes of my life back!"""
" I Can't Abide By even Fake Baby Killing
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,1,"ANY movie that kills babies or children, even though it's (obviously) fake, I'll always rate low. Sorry.
I started this movie with high hopes. Then, the witch (supposedly) steals a baby right from under the nose of the baby's sister.
The witch laid him on a table and at that point, I knew the baby would be slaughtered.
I immediately turned it off.
Sorry, can't help it. I'll never, EVER watch any abuse or killings of animals or small children."
" Boring
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,1,"Started ok, but killing a baby in the first 15 minutes is a little grim. As all new films, quiet talking and noisy sound effects. Not sure why watched till end, boring, poor, unbelievable."
" Utterly gripping, transfixing, engrossing, and suspenseful.
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,10,"I'm unfortunately an millennial who is glued to his phone throughout most movies and tv shows. However I (literally) forgot I even owned a phone while watching this movie. It was sort of like being on a good drug trip, where you're in a different dimension/reality and in the middle of it, you have a slight moment of clarity where you're like ""whoa this is really taking me out of my head"". And it did just that, it was truly an experience. From the natural lighting to the perfectly timed score, it was completely worth my time from the first second to the last. It was incredible.During this scene near the middle, about a 5 minute scene, at the end I found myself wide eyed and mouth open with how brilliantly written, directed and acted it was. 100/10"
" So uncommonly good that this review will be shared to social media!
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,10,"I am not at all a horror film person, so I found it very odd that Holy Spirit seem to kept saying that this one was for me.I would caution that practicing an active life of faith, especially in the name of Jesus Christ, would likely make this movie more appealing; however, it isn't necessary to hold any particular beliefs to still enjoy the film.Those who have come to rely on the sensationalism of Hollywood--blood and gore and overly graphic language--to inform them of how they should feel during a story might find the action sequences of this movie too few and far between the dialogue sequences, which is mostly prayer language and ominous music.I'm only half-joking when I say that captions translating the spoken language from Puritan English into contemporary English would be helpful for many.More importantly, I apologize, but I need to get on my soapbox for a second:
 What I love most about this movie is the understated way that it portrays the effects of witchcraft. Yes there are some graphic scenes and some horrifically creepy s***. But, you don't see any angels or demons flying around. And where, in a movie like Harry Potter, a curse would appear as a viscous jet of fiery plasma/lightning, all you see here is writhing on the floor in agony, crying out to God, with no visible clue as to what's going on. Guys, that's exactly how witchcraft works in the real world. No matter what you've been told about God and Jesus and the Bible, whether you've ever given a thought to spiritual warfare or not, it's all real. But almost none of it looks like something that most of us would want to pay good money to go see at the movies. I don't remember who said ""the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist,"" but it's true.Fortunately, unlike the special effects, Dumbledore uttered some words that were very true: ""words are our most inexhaustible form of magic.""
The Apostle Paul puts it a little differently, ""for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but are mighty for the pulling down of strongholds. We demolish debates and any high-minded thing that would exalt itself above knowledge of God, taking every thought captive in obedience to Christ"" - 2 Corinthians 10:4-5"
" Just a quick warning
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,6,"Let me begin by saying I did not finish this movie. Therefore, I cannot give an accurate review of this film. I just wanted to warn new viewers that within five to ten minutes of this movie's beginning, there was very disturbing nudity. And by disturbing, I mean a very old naked lady on screen and a scene with (out of focus) naked male baby genitilia. My friend and I are horror fanatics, the gnarlier and more extreme the better. However, neither of us could get past the disturbing nudity. I was extremely uncomfortable and afraid to continue out of fear of more old-lady or child nudity. Just be warned."
" Spoiler alert.. it sucks
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,1,"The Witch was literally the worst movie I have ever seen. I feel like people that gave it good reviews were paid to do so. It was advertised as the scariest movie in a decade.... I didnt jump once nor was I ever on the edge of my seat. I have not met one person who has disagreed with me. If I could request a refund for any movie that I have ever seen, it would be for The Witch."
" More comedy than psychological thriller
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,3,"Movie was beautiful. Actors did their job well. I watched the movie with low volume and subtitles. I needed to burn 90 minutes before going to bed, but didn't want to wake my roommate.Movie starts off alright. And then the baby disappears. I can't figure out what could steal a baby that quick. Conviently, the following scene alerts me, and I can safely blame a witch. Start suspending all disbelief at that point.Oh, and some reviewers say the movie represents the ugly nature of religious fanaticism, but ... there's a witch people. Come on, now.This movie is not a feminist movie. Otherwise, the witch wouldn't be a pure evil villain. And a goat wouldn't steal the show. The witch doesn't get any respect as a woman or a villain.This is not a psychological thriller, because the witch is real. The family argues and prays a lot. They live a subsistence farming lifestyle. In that situation, plenty of families turn abusive. It's not psychologically thrilling, it's just normal. So the story again, is a simple historical drama.With a couple weird scenes to signal the end of the movie. And then 5 more minutes of weird scenes. And then the movie is truly over.One of the character deaths made me laugh.I give the movie 3/10 for the camera work, the historical research, and the character death, which humored me quite a bit. It loses 7 points because the movie does not pay attention to its audience. Not enough people are fanatics who will have nightmares over the material."
" A witch that deserves respect
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,7,"I understand the disappointment of those who expected The Witch to be a horror. There aren't jump scares, monsters or running with Satan in a forest. But there is atmosphere, authenticity (oh, the old English), tension and great acting. Moreover, in the first 10 minutes it's shown that the witch is really there, and no twists like ""the main heroine is the witch"", ""everything is just religious psychosis"" or ""it's open to everyone's interpretation"" will follow.The witch is not portrayed as a monster that goes around forest, murdering teenagers on every corner, but mainly as a ubiquitous, untouchable evil. The scenes with her are short, but just as effective. The Witch has problems because it is psychological, historically authentic and without action. I liked it, but mainstream used to ""horrors"" like Annabelle won't probaply get it."
" Made me sleep

" Boring
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,1,"I can honestly say this is one of, if not THE, worst films I've seen in my life. It's so self indulgent with absolutely zero substance. Just 2 hours of nothing with spooky ambiance. If I wanted that I'd go to a middle school haunted house. Avoid at all cost."
" No masterpiece. Not even very good.
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,5,I have not been so disappointing in a movie in a long time. I like slow films when they are well done and leading to something but this just leads to sleep! So many 10 star reviews that you start to think this must be fake or I am not understanding something. Maybe it is the old English language I found difficult to follow but there is no story to follow! It would have been intriguing if they didn't give away the whole twist in the first minutes! You then spending 2 boring hours watching the actors slowly realize what you already know! A very strange decision that doesn't improve anything with the narrative but makes it very tedious. Maybe my score is harsh but I think with so many fake 10/10 it is important to redress the balance. The score is very atmospheric and is the cinematography. The acting is good. Especially the goat! Haha.
" Very Boring

" Looks great but do we really need another whiny lead actress?
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,4,"This film seems very tempting, the setting and style of dress really draw you in. I was looking forward to a strong storyline about tough survivalist Puritans facing the realities of North America. Instead, we get a handwoven basket chock full o' stereotypes: the mother of the family is only a mother, and her only contribution to the storyline is her overused, stereotypical obsession with a dead infant. Because moms don't have any character of their own ya know? They just make babies. That's all. And when the babies are gone they basically implode.The other female lead is a nasty old witch that steals babies from respectable moms. The dad's an incredulous gruff alpha male that barely tolerates all the whiny (as in, high pitched shrill wibbling that has no content, just expresses a kind of animal hysteria) antics of the women in the cast. Yuck. Why waste such incredible style on such predictable, stale characters? the story's set in the 16th Century; that doesn't mean that we have to regress 400 years just to watch it, but that's exactly what the makers of The Witch seem to have done. I couldn't take the whining woman anymore and switched it off, myself - if that does your head in, you'll want to do the same."

" Nice concept, but disappointing
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,5,"This movie had a lot of good bits that made up an unsatisfying whole. I enjoyed the first 20 minutes - it had a nice atmosphere and got me excited to find out what the story was going to slowly build up to. Unfortunately, I didn't think it built up to anything worthwhile. When the witch does appear, it's predictable and uninteresting. The drama within the family was a bit more interesting, but it didn't really go anywhere either. The parts that were supposed to be scary I thought were just sad. It is a nice look into the lives of these people and this time period but I don't think it should have been classified as a horror movie. The fact that I couldn't understand 50% of what they were saying didn't help either."
" So boring
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,1,It was so boring and without a meaningful story. There was also non-sense actions in the movie. Rate 1 is not fair enough for this. I wish I could rate 0.
" Meh
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,5,"Acting, dialogue, sets, cinematography, and editing were all great. One star given for each of those, so 5/10, but the entire plot is awful, and i cant go any higher than that.I was not expecting or hoping for a super scary horror movie, so thats not why I dont like it. It is very intense, but its really stupid and by the end, just became goofy.So as we all know, witches arent real, and the religious persecution of women believed to be witches is a result of cult-like think and fear and possibly mental illness of those who chose to claim they were witches. This movie, however, asserts that witches are 100% real. Okay.. so lets suspend our disbelief. It is no longer the real world but a world where actual satanic witches who act through satan with magical evil powers exist. Even once you accept that, the behavior of Thomassin is still completely illogical. It turns out she was right that the goat was satan. She sees her whole family possessed and killed and kills her own mother in self defense. So she then decides to join the witches. What??? She wasn't a witch the whole movie. We saw that. We see it through Thomassin's own eyes. We saw that she didn't harm the baby - an actual witch did. She didn't harm Caleb - an actual witch did. She was an innocent party, not possessed, and instead was trying to help her family. Then suddenly at the recognition that her whole family was dead, she decides to join them and they all float in the air naked around a fire.I dont think that this young girl who was very plainly asserted to us to be a loving, faithful daughter who was wrongly blamed for someone else's wrongdoings would suddenly join the witches at the end.So if she actually was a witch throughout the whole movie, as it sometimes is suggested, then they shouldve made it more clear to Thomassin herself. If she noticed herself becoming evil, tried to fight it, but eventually embraced it, then thatd explain her actions. But that didnt happen. She felt innocent, she was innocent and knew it of herself, but she still became evil. Dumb.Also i would've liked more backstory on the witches themselves and a deeper insight into who they are, where they came from, and why they followed this path. Personally I think a movie with a similar tone but instead set in the real world wouldve been better. Instead of actual real witches, the family descends into madness and accuses each other of evil until they are all dead from paranoia and anger. Not some floating naked women and a goat. Or at LEAST if theyre going to choose the supernatural path, make it where Thomassin's actions fit within normal human behavior and not just random. It seemed like they didnt know how to end it any other way.It just felt silly to me."
" Review for The Witch
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,9,"This movie is one of the more interesting horror movies I have seen in a while. I also enjoyed the aspect ratio, which made everything claustrophobic, and that's not a bad thing. The actors did an amazing performance."
" Absolute Perfection
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,10,"Along with The Cabin in the Woods, It Follows, and perhaps also the first Insidious (2010...counting it), The Witch is EASILY, EASILY one of the greatest and most original horror movies of the current decade. The filmmakers went further than anyone has before in authentically recreating the time period and place, very early colonial New England, and the language the characters use may be initially off-putting but do what I did, turn subtitles on and make an effort to try to appreciate real historical accuracy that took a lot of effort in the face of being unpopular. If you are honest with yourself, you'll admit that you are following what's going on just fine and the realism is what sells the film. It gives more credit to the depiction of the ""true"" stories that were used to inspire the film. There is just the right amount of....witchery.... to be completely terrifying and seem as though it really could be something that really did happen. Any more focus away from a more ""normal"" setting, any more footage of witchcraft would have taken away from the power of what we ARE shown. Yes, it is a supernatural based horror film, but its dedication to historical accuracy makes it come off feeling so real, so possible, so plausible, and if you give yourself over to it, it becomes absolutely believable, as well as giving us today a better understanding of just how horrifying witchcraft was to people of that era, almost to the point of understanding why the witch trials of early America took such a hold over people, people who didn't have beliefs more rooted in science and reason. Witches were accepted as fact and if you submit to the movie and suspend that disbelief, you'll see how terrified those people might have been when coming face to face with what they believed to be credible stories of witches and witchcraft. And if it just did happen to be real, witchcraft I mean, this is the indisputably most accurate depiction of real witches.
So glad to have been alive at a time like this and to have watched it.

" Another A24 hit
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,8,"A24 is fast becoming my go to studio for intruiging, and often under-rated horror movies, and The Witch fits the bill. This movie was really quite impressive in it's realism to the time it was set, so much so, you could honestly believe this story did happen. The characters were expertly portrayed, and all tragic but fascinating, so you actually are invested in what happens to them. The scares in this film are sparse but well-earned. Eggers spends most of this movie building tension so that the few scenes in which he wishes to terrify, he succeeds exceptionally. I went into this with high expectations and was not disappointed. The Witch is a dense, complex, and deeply unsettling movie, but because of that, it is truly brilliant."
" Rather boring
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,3,I had high expectations for this movie and this just did not equal them at all. Nothing really seemed to be happening throughout the movie except that the family were starving and they had a child go missing. This was until near the end and that's only because the rest of the family died and the person they kept calling a witch finally became one. I couldn't find myself connecting to any of the characters and thought the actors mumbled a lot which made me not really know what they were saying and made me really bored.
" Work like this takes true talent
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,9,"Let's travel back in time.... way back to the time of the settlers. Things were very different back then. Religion had a much stronger presence in society. Along with that, you had rampant paranoia of witchcraft. These two historical facts play a big role in the core plot of The Witch.The plot focuses on a family that has just been banned from a village. With nowhere else to go, they travel outside of the village and try to make it on their own. They start growing their own harvest, each member of the family doing their part in the work. They rely heavily on their very intense Christian faith. Unfortunately for them, weird things start to happen.... starting with the children. Soon it becomes clear that supernatural forces are at work around them. The only question is.... who is to blame? Paranoia plays a role here, so much so that it eventually leads everything to a breaking point. The acting in this film is some of the finest you'll see. The performances given scream talent, you can really tell that this cast was passionate about their roles. Anya Taylor-Joy blew me away as Thomasin, she really captured the emotion and depth necessary to play the role. Kate Dickie is also great here, she plays Katherine, the distraught mother. Dickie throws herself into this role and delivers a truly captivating performance. Lastly, is Ralph Ineson, who plays the extremely devout Christian father. I loved him in this role! He totally nailed it as William, portraying a confused, angry father trying desperately to understand what's happening to his family.I absolutely adore the score in this film. It's so unsettling and sets the perfect tone. That along with environment and visuals create a very chilling watching experience. What I love about films released by A24, is that they are all so raw and disturbingly realistic. If you want real horror and it's an A24 horror film, you're almost guaranteed quality. The ending is another great asset this film carries, it ends in the most chilling and unsettling way. I refuse to spoil anything, you'll just have to see for yourself. 9/10 for The With."

",2018-08-02 00:00:00,9,"I do not really like this movie that much. It is a bit too boring, extremely slow paced, and a bit confusing at times.However the acting is phenomenal, from the Goat to the kids, and if Anya Taylor-Joy is not a shining star a couple of years from now I am going to eat my laptop. The story is also very compelling. Yes, it is not perfectly told, as it is also confusing, but very interesting nevertheless. The movie is feeding us psychological horror and it works thanks to an amazing cast. The ending is also top. I love it when evil ""wins"", and I also believe it open up the possibility for sequels. I think they should do a follow up to this, Anya Taylor-Joy can play a fully grown adult witch that uses her body, mind and spells to gain immortality and watch the Salem trials from afar while chewing on a baby..."

I watched the movie with a friend who normally gets scared easily but both of us wondered when it was going to get going. I started to feel it only got a high mark because the cast managed to speak old northern English throughout the movie! 
If you are like me and prefer old school jumps and scares don't watch this. If you like 2+ hours of finger pointing and rubbish the feel free to watch this."
" A grotesque picture of religious horror
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,9,"At its roots, the horror genre attract us because it forces us to face our personal demons: this kind of terror coming from facing unknown monsters that are metaphors of our daily life struggles or fears strangely intrigues us. When horrors deal with religion though, they usually just use it as an excuse to make horned demons appear pretty much everywhere but The Witch is extremely different: we barely see any monster, violence is kept at a minimum and the terror usually comes in form of a terrible sense of unease. When this New England family is banished and forced to live in exile amidst the woods, we immediately see that their journey is doomed. 
The younger child, Samuel, disappears and it doesn't take long before each family member starts blaming each other until accusations of witchcraft and demonic possession arise. 
Not too differently from Carpenter's The Thing, The Witch focuses on the personal relationship between the cast members and their feeling of un trust that the father tries to sedate through prayers and sermons. The Witch rarely gives some answers, it keeps the viewer constantly wondering why some things happen, whether someone in the family has signed a path with the Devil or some evil force has simply decided to put its hands on the Abbot family.
The more we watch, the more we're inclined to think someone in particular attracted the Witch of the Woods and we're left wondering until the bodies start piling up. The Witch isn't a movie for everyone though: the slow pace doesn't always help building up the suspense and more in general the screenplay asks the viewers to be patient and wait for the final climax. 
Those who are up to it though, will enjoy one of the creepiest and amazing horror movies of the past years."

Everything seems to be going well until Tomisen plays peek-a boo with the baby( Sam). When she opens her eyes Sam vanishes. She tells her mom and Katherine is distraught. Little dose the family know that a witch lives out in the woods, and she has done some sacrifice with Sam. Then strange things begin to happen the crops begin to fail, the family will starve if they don't find other means of food. So William and Caleb go out to hunt, that when William tells Caleb that he sold a valuable piece of Katherine's. It was for money so they could get by. When they go hunting the dog spots something, but is killed. When they arrive back Mercy starts teasing Tomisen that she's a witch. Well when the family hears about this, every member starts to turn on one another. The animals begin to stop producing milk, and things just go down hill from there. One night Caleb goes out on his own, but is later seduced by a young witch. When he gets home he is barely alive, and eventually becomes possessed and dies. The parents begin not to trust the children, and their goat black Phillip is not what it seems. This movie explores the occult like no other film I watched has. It full of mystery, deception, and a great twist at the end. I gave it a 7, but really it deserves a 7.5. Regardless of your taste in horror movies this is one I would highly recommend."
" Stellar scenery and amazing atmosphere!
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,8,"Do not go into this movie expecting horror or gore, this is movie is all about the atmosphere, calm and mellow at times, but surely intense enough throughout. Absolutely stunning imagery and scenery all throughout the film a it is set in a 1630's forest. The movie does not solely revolve around withcraft and magic as the title might lead one to believe, it takes a rather different approach giving us insight into the heavy religious influence in the 17th century. Overall, the movie has a great vibe to it, watching a film like this makes you forget about the usual appeals of horror/thriller movies as you easily get sucked into the atmosphere of this movie even without much crazy and intense action you are feeling the rising tension between the close-knit family as the eldest daugther becomes suspected as a witch. Note that there is an enourmous religious prejudice and bias in this movie as it is all about god worship and being an obedient person living out god's will. If you have a problem with the heavy religious tone this movie has, i would suggest not watching it, because i can understand how redundant that can get at times. A really relaxing, but tense film, that is worth watching for many different reasons, do not expect gore or horror as i have said above, enjoy the sound effects, beautiful imagery and the usage of old english, which is rather rare in movies and art nowadays!"
" So dull
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,3,"We persevered through this, and really wish we hadn't. By the time people were talking to goats it was too late. As the screen went black and we declared 'that better not be it', lo bad behold a wasted 90 minutes was concluded with a ridiculous non-ending.The only saving grace is some decent acting from the eldest sister. I would; however, invest your time elsewhere. 3/10."
" Truly Boring.
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,1,"I love and prefer a psychological thriller, and tend to stay away from movies that rely on gore or jump scares, but this was just plain uninteresting.Cerebral films can be engaging and fascinating, but they must entertain in order to engage. They set up the concept of how terrifying life in the new world circa 1630-something would have been and then slowly dissolved all of that wonderful potential in favor of further suspense that leads to.......nothing. A period drama/suspense. Nothing thrilling here."
" These reviews are so misleading.
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,1,This movie sucked. It had so much potential and then wasted it. I hate movies that ruin it with the ending. I hate loose ends and this movie had quite a few. Yuck.
" Not everything fits into the ""horror"" category cleanly
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,9,"The Witch is an atmospheric period drama/fantasy/thriller that is true to its surroundings. At the time and place, superstitious ideas about witches and devils, sins and redemption was a very social and personal normal condition. The Witch takes the classic fairy-tale approach down a dark path and one becomes a helpless spectator in a world that is both beautiful and frustrating at the same time. The acting is superb and writing borrows directly from historical Puritan and Elizabethan documents to preserve accuracy of dialog, set pieces and culture. It's a disquieting journey with a twist, but if you appreciate this kind of emotional investment in a film, you should find The Witch to be rewarding. What one makes of the ending is entirely personal."
" Descent to despair
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,9,"The movie was terrifying, not only for the scenes of explicit violence but for the psychological terror in it. We can see how little by little a family and their faith in God slowly disintegrates to a disconcerting ending"
" Good overall
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,7,"During New England 's Puritan era, a family of six (including a pregnant mother) is banished from a community and forced to fend for themselves in the countryside. Once there, supernatural forces intensify their paranoia of witchcraft.The story is sparse but compact. While its ending is too mysterious and leaves many holes, it is still fascinating in its own special way.The greatest flaw in the film is that much of the dialogue is incomprehensible. It has the right intention in using old English and an older dialect. However, as some important lines are muddled, much gets lost.Despite this flaw, the acting is quite good as are the production values. There is a suitably bleak mood that rightly surrounds a family falling apart in facing great difficulty. Their dour, paranoid views of God, Satan, and witchcraft don't help matters. One wonders if their belief systems are at least as horrific as the outside forces.Overall, the pluses outweigh the minuses."
" Tedious
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,1,"Me and my partner love horror films so after reading great reviews I suggested we go watch the witch . Seriously the worst film I've ever seen , nothing happened, I seriously believe people must be lying when they say it's a 10 out of 10 movie . All most 2 years later after seeing it I'm still telling people how awful it is. My advice is never watch this dreadful piece of garbage. No !!!!!"
" The real challange was finding a reason not to rate 10. Stop reading and go watch.
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,9,"Often when reviewing Horror films (my favorite genre) I discuss the acute necessity of lowered expectations if one hopes to enjoy, as sadly this undervalued genre lacks the investment (professional, financial and creative) it so rightfully deserves. More often than not a film of the genre graced with a great trailer, an intriguing poster or any form of positive publicity (mostly informal) is devoid of any remotely sufficient quality of story, acting or cinematics. However, in regards to The Witch - worry not. Bring on your highest expectations and be mentally prepared to trash this film as soon as it's finished, it would do you no good. In my opinion, The Witch is one of the best Horror films you'll watch.Everything about The Witch feels classical and fancy, as something about the combination between Little House in the Prairie and Poltergeist hits the atmospheric spot perfectly. The setting, while simple almost to the point of being unimpressive (but just almost), is original and very seldom implemented in such a terrifying plot. The story revolves around William and his Family, a stereotypically devout (even fanatic) Christian family from 19th century New England. After leaving their community on account of its inhabitants not being sufficiently Christian by William's judgement, the family establishes their own little homeland in a nearby rural plain. A wooden shack, a farm, a stock of barnyard animals and the satisfaction of a hard day's work and doing well by one's cherrished deity. That is, until a mysterious and nefarious force begins to torment the family, weakening their faith as well as their family ties and letting their paranoia drive them apart to the point of hatered.The acting is superb by all members of the cast, particularly the breathtaking Anya Taylor-Joy (daughter Thomasin). You know all these slasher films casting eye candies with mediocre and unconvincing acting? Forget them. Taylor-Joy is genuinely authentic and professional aside from being captivating like a renaissance model. Harvey Scrimshaw (her brother, Caleb) also with a superb performance, damaged somewhat solely by what is obviously a direction error. Ralph Ineson (William) is also a pleasure to watch and experience. Aside from the acting skills, the casting has been as accurate and clever as can be (probably along with some excellent writing, directing and art-dress-makeup). Each and every character feels real, authentic and compelling, making me personally feel like each and every cast member was made for their role. Enough to warrant a 6.5 even if this has been the film's sole quality. It isn't. Not remotely.The story is an emotional roller-coaster, sharply and almost violently dragging the viewer from sadness to anticipation, from suspense to fear, from pity to anger. Indeed, the dark force tormenting the family seems to affect the viewers similarly, drawing them into the story and making the entire experience all the more horrific. It isn't a literary masterpiece, but a good screenplay needs not be to achieve its goal. It only needs to tell a compelling and clever story with the right dosage of fear. Add to that the 19th century setting, the old English texts and the farmhand costumes - and you feel like you're told an old terrifying folktale. An absolute pleasure!The only aspect in which I felt the film didn't fulfill its potential was the ending. A worthy attempt to create a plot twist was indeed made, but unsuccessfully. The ending feels like the worst part of the film, the least exciting and not at all frightening. From certain perspectives one might even consider it a happy ending, which is completely out of touch with the mood the film worked so hard to create. In a word: anticlimactic, the all too familiar bane and curse of the genre. While The Witch is simply that good as to not suffer in quality on this fault's account - I can't help but feel disappointed, as it really was one good ending (not even great, just good and better than the actual one) from being a Horror masterpiece.In summary? I can't remain objective, I loved this film too much. I simply feel obligated to encourage each and every cinema fan to turn off the lights and watch The Witch, preferably at night and home alone. Of course, many of you might disagree with me, it's a matter of subjective preferences after all, but I personally am grateful for the experience The Witch has put me through."
" both haters and fans are somehow wrong
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,8,"Some say it's slow and boring and not horror, others say it's a masterpiece. i think they are both right, and in the best way possible. it's not horror if by horror one means the new It or Poltergeist or Mirrors; it's another, more psychological, kind of horror, because IT IS very tense, suspenseful, and has some great scary scenes. and yes, i could say, in the actual landscape of horror movies, it is a masterpiece. i didn't like the linear story: it goes from A to B to C without any real end surprises, but on the other hand it kept me guessing all the time. all in all, i highly recommend it, but not if you want something gory with cheap thrills."
" Oh wow!!
",2018-06-20 00:00:00,7,"All I'd like to say about this film, is that it was completely and utterly fantastic! This is almost as perfect a film as one could get. It was eerie, unpredictable and very disturbing. The acting was superb. The film cleverly does not make use of visual effects and instead substitutes it with dark and foreboding forests, sheds and homes. This greatly enhances the tension and makes it more credible. The scene where Thomasin surrenders to witchcraft and becomes overjoyed and blissful as she transforms into a witch is rather disturbing - even more so since this scene was also done without CGI effects."
" Great, but not perfect.
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,7,"Let's start off by saying this movie is NOT for everyone. It does not have jumpscares, supernatural fights or any «action». The focus here is on story, dialouge and creepiness. Acting, filming and sound is great. It has some disturbing scenes that are memorable, especially the introduction. However, my main issue with the film is the lack of depth. Nothing is explained, motives are unclear and there are many scenes that don't need to be in there. Rationalism is thrown out the window and replaced with religion. Many actions don't match their characters personality. And the ending left you wanting more. On the positive side, if you like slow and creepy movies without the need for depth - this is a great option."
" Horror at the core.
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,8,"Finally after waiting for years, someone actually had enough sense to make a pure witch movie. It is everything you'd want from something that is so deeply rooted in American folk lore. This movie gets back to the roots of horror and leaves behind the over the top action sequences and the relentless use of CGI! I suggest you watch it now, but don't forget the sub titles. This truly is an uneasy movie from the very beginning."
" Slow, but disturbing masterpiece
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,9,"Easily one of my favorite horror movies of all time. It terrified me throughout, and the suspense builds into one of the most horrifying endings I've seen in a while. Could not recommend more. (Unless you're looking for a conventional horror movie with jump scares throughout and is fast paced)"
" The WITCH
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,7,Great movie all up very enjoyable but I found the ending a bit of a let down.
" American as apple pie
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,10,"THE WITCH is a haunting little opus in which film maker Robert Eggers reaches back into the folklore and living history of the United States to produce a story that's going to stick with you awhile. In this tale, a 17th century Puritan father breaks with his pilgrim forebears over Christian doctrine and leads his family out into an unforgiving section of wilderness which seemingly is also occupied by a blood cult of Wiccans. Things do not go well. That's all I'm going to tell you. 
But here there be mastery. No jump scares, no blood sloshed from here to creation, no zombies. Just good story telling, an outstanding cast, and some imagery that will have you up staring at the ceiling until two in the morning. That's what the good spook stories do. Best of all, THE WITCH is a bold reach into the grab bag of unique grand guignols that life in this section of the Americas is. It is American as apple pie. And it's going to scare the crap out of you. Enjoy."
" More contemporary drama with great character work, than thriller/horror
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,7,"The Witch is a praised movie, that falls under the horror genre. We went into this movie with different expectations, which helped us to enjoy this movie. Although there is a witch, and although there are supernatural elements, that isn't what this movie is about.The movie is about a family of outcasts who try to maintain a living on their own, when natural elements are threatening their life (food, animals), but also their faith in God. Their faith is such a strong foundation and source of love, that when their faith is seemingly threatened, life and sanity start falling apart.And that is what this movie is about. A pretty natural reenactment of how life was in that period. The surrounding, the clothing, the acting, the lines are a very loyal representation of life and values in those times. That alone makes that the movie can feel like a thriller. The brilliant acting and character work will make the viewer feel like he's in a thriller, because the threat comes from the inside, from lies and from naivity.Thank God those times are over, but also thanks for giving the viewer insight in those times, strengths and weaknesses."
" Bevvitching!
",2018-05-28 00:00:00,8,"A rather slow paced atmospheric, mostly psychological horror. The setting, the story and the way the ""threat"" manifests itself are all brilliant! It is beautiful to watch, it's never dull since the air is thick with tension! it's scary, or rather unnerving.. since ""scary"" has become too much associated with jump scares! I quite loved it."
" Confusing
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,5,"I just watched it and found it very confusing. Who exactly was the witch and why was this family constantly tormented throughout? It was visually well-made, but confusing."
" Resting between horror and drama, this folk-take is ominous and unsettling in its own strange, almost mundane way.
",2018-05-15 00:00:00,7,"Resting somewhere between horror and drama, this period-piece folk-tale is difficult to categorise and even harder to describe. 'The Witch (2016)' is incredibly subdued throughout, its ominous tone helped by a uniquely grandiose score. As such, it only barely holds your attention while it plays to a mundanity of the time and lifestyle its characters occupy. There's a sense of tension building in the background, though, and the off-kilter moments that stand-out are certainly quite unsettling in their own strange way. However, the ambiguity tips over into the oddly overt in a bizarre final scene that, while compelling, has no ramifications other than serving as an abruptly over-the-top end to an otherwise subtle story. 7/10"
" Savage Folk Horror
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,9,"The Witch: Intriguing film. Was this about the literal appearance of Satan and actual Witches in thrall to him? Or could it all be the result of ergot contamination of the crops causing hallucinations? I'll be mulling this over for a while to come.A religious zealot and his family are forced to leave a New England colony in 1638 and set up a homestead on the edge of a forest. A newborn baby disappears while in the care of her adolescent sister. We ""see"" a witch making off with the infant and sacrificing him but the father insists a wolf was responsible.More strange occurrences and the blame continues to attach to the the young girl. Echoes of The Crucible here in the behaviour of her two youngest siblings.Wonderfully filmed in a bleak landscape, with attention to historical detail.The diction and grammar used is that of the 17th century and at times may be difficult to understand. 9/10."
" For masochist or sadist only
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,2,"The film has great cinematography and costume design. Full of symbolism and not much else. If you are a satanist, you will enjoy the final scene. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate this movie a 2."
" Words fail me
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,3,"""Finally no Hollywood crap"", says one of the reviews.This, to me, is the epitome of a whole lot of things I'd consider exactly Hollywood crap. There's hardly any part of this that strives towards any kind of artistic expression. It's all about the things that count, and the things that count in Hollywood are that it has to be pretentious, acted in a certain way, visually pleasing and must avoid anything that would come over as too strong. It has to be bland, dumb and well packaged and this is certainly all three of those things, which shows in critic ratings.There's not really a story here... just a series of events stranded together, but none of them carry any meaning. Not even one you could give yourself as a commentary on the real life situation, like in a documentary without a clear agenda. This movie is like wallpaper or elevator music, but taking forever to achieve the same effect. At one third I was afraid they had no idea where to take it, at two thirds I was 100 % sure of it. The ending feels like the joke ran too long and they decided to go grab a snack to eat so they just shot whatever to sum it up.The Witch is great at all the wrong things, at things that can elevate the experience, but cannot make it. And this is as elevated as something so shallow can possibly be. It knows that if it does not try, it can't be faulted for failing."
" So Boring. SPOILERS
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,1,"The movie is darkly lit, so it's hard to see. The characters don't behave like human beings in the least, and the witch is a witch, but just a homicidal maniac type of witch. I can't believe anybody could give it a good review. I recommend you watch something else, even dirt drying."

" Like a nightmarish bedtime story
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,8,"From the moment the film begins, you're trapped in a spider web of dread.This is the tale of a deeply religious English pilgrim family who is exiled from their community, and made to start over alone in the countryside with nothing. From there, things go from bad to worse. That's all I should tell you about plot.For right now, let's talk about the overall aesthetic of the movie.""The Witch"" is one of the most deliriously gorgeous films I've ever seen, owing most to its impeccable direction and production design. This is a movie that could potentially unseat ""Eraserhead"" as the most atmospherically bleak, unsettling, tense, and hopeless film ever (okay, at least for me). The experimental, string-based score ropes everything together -- deafening crescendos are shuffled with uneasy undertones and moments of paralyzing silence. The acting is excellent on all fronts; my only slight complaint being Ralph Ineson's overall diction, which seemed forced at times and occasionally muddled his line delivery.But for all intents and purposes, this is an incredible movie. The reason for my 8/10 and not any higher is because it just isn't accessible to most people. Despite its stunning design and direction, many will be left unsatisfied or feeling stupid because they feel like they don't ""get it."" Probably like you, I hate movies that make me feel stupid. When I saw ""The Witch"" in theaters when it first came out, I felt stupid. I thought the movie was terrifying, but I felt stupid.After a rewatch two years later, I finally understood why it's so scary, and why none of us should feel stupid, whether you've already seen it or not. I'll explain.This is a movie that has been lambasted for being ""slow,"" ""boring,"" and having little to no discernible plot or explanation. While the film is admittedly a slow burn, you have to be prepared for what you're getting into. The hint is in the movie's subtitle: ""A New England Folktale."" That's exactly what this is -- it's a period piece, and a culmination of extensive research into the behaviors and speech of 17th century settlers in New England (look for an interview with director Robert Eggers with the British Film Institute). Much of the script is in an early-modern dialect, which can be confusing at times. Some of the themes could initially be dismissed as laughable; for example, the idea of a witch stealing an infant being both fathomable and deeply horrifying. It's easy to see why many wouldn't be engaged by this movie beyond its production qualities. But we mustn't forget -- this is the era of Puritans and the Salem trials.Let's get some context.The correct mindset to watch this film in is thinking about it as an experience similar to reading ""Macbeth"" in high school. The cool thing about early-modern literature is that we all experienced it the same way -- whether we're currently 18 or 80, we all read that play in high school and were probably initially bored by it, despite understanding its importance. It's something that we imagine was probably terrifying and original a few hundred years back, but today seems stale. In truth, it was the written/oral product of King James I's obsession and fear of demonology and witchcraft. It was the real deal back then.Meanwhile, the Puritans are settling in New England because they don't think the Anglo-Catholics are taking God seriously enough. The seed of witch hysteria across the Atlantic is planted, and we all know how things go in Salem.The United States wasn't introduced to Shakespeare until the 1800s, long after this time period. But if they could've read/seen it, would ""Macbeth"" had been scary to the deeply religious Puritans? Maybe. What if they could experience a terrifying folktale as we experience movies today in the 21st century? Would they run screaming? Today's horror films that are watchable mostly use (or at least attempt to use) original ideas and themes. ""The Witch"" isn't that. It's a folktale. It's written and shot like one. This isn't ""It Follows;"" there is no deep, allegorical connection to be made. It's a bedtime story told to impressionable little children by candlelight.Dark folktales are never exactly masterpieces of plot and thematic structure, and this movie isn't one either. It has a very simple plot that isn't very scary (at least by modern standards). What's scary is the way it's delivered. Don't go into this movie like you're a snob and grasping at straws to develop ""hidden meanings"" or whatever. If you're really into film, this is probably ingrained in you whether you like it or not. Get rid of it before watching this. There is no hidden meaning to this film. It's not pretentious -- you're just thinking too hard.Relish in the atmosphere. Go where the film takes you, even if it's confusing or nonsensical. It's okay to be confused. Being confused can be scary and uneasy. The monster under the bed is scarier if you don't know why it's there or where it came from.Experience this movie in complete darkness and with the best possible sound system."
" Robert Eggers: A Name to Remember
",2018-04-10 00:00:00,9,"""The Witch"" is just a brilliant film, and plenty scary. Despite the divide between the critics and audiences on this film (as can be expected by any horror film A24 touches), I highly agree with the critics.One thing that I will talk about is the film's score. I would compare it to ""The Shining"", in the sense that it added to the film's creepy atmosphere. Did it provide some jumpscare music? Yes. But did it do it very often? Thankfully, no.Speaking of jump scares, I actually counted how many there were in this movie: 2. This movie managed to scare me silly with only 2 jump scares. Do you want to know why? Because the movie is very disturbing and creepy.The acting and writing in the film are splendid. The entire cast did a fine job, especially with the meaty dialogue they were given. Their performances made some already scary moments even scarier. I also loved the the dialogue felt extremely contextualized. This wasn't like in ""The Village"", where the dialogue sounded relatively modern despite its supposed 18th century setting. This film's dialogue sounded so old (or should I say ""olde"") that I almost had trouble understand them some times. Eggers has proven himself with this fine debut.My only problem I had with this film was that it should have taken the disturbing content slightly down a notch. That's it. That's my only complaint.""The Witch"" (or ""The VVitch"", if you want to mock the marketing) is a splendidly scary film that should be watched by any horror movie aficionado."
" Phenomenal.
",2018-04-09 00:00:00,10,Watching it multiple times makes me appreciate all the little details more and more. Beautiful movie.
" Bad lighting & a loud soundtrack
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,1,"I'm pretty sure half the visuals in the film were hidden by bad lighting. The same goes for the dialog, either the backing music (cliche horror scream-chorus) was to loud or the actors were mumbling. From what I gleaned of the rest of it, a slow burner to nowhere. I gave up about half way through because the score had a constant whine to it that felt like simulated tinnitus, & the scenes had apparently devolved into children shouting each others names in scared voices whilst carrying candles (there may have been other things in the scenes but it's hard to tell as they appeared to be lit by candle light then darkened with a filter post production).It felt like someone was trying very hard to make a cult classic horror but I think if you take off the soundtrack it would be obvious the movie is more a period drama with paranoid people. I can't say I noticed much of a plot... at one point there was a rabbit that was clearly scary because of the ominous music, perhaps some sort of Monty Python homage that was so deadpan I missed it. TL,DR: Turn up the brightness on your screen if you want to see what's happening."

" A very good, tense, atmospheric, gothic horror.
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,8,"To say I didn't get what I was expecting is a huge understatement, I was expecting a run of the mill horror, with all the usual cliches, obvious and blatant scares, etc, but instead I got to watch ninety minutes of rather subtle, intelligent and subtle horror. The film is hugely atmospheric, moody and tense, it is visually fantastic, with great scenery and costumes. The story unfolds cleverly, when I think of witches, this is what comes to mind, as opposed to the more conventional. As you watch you never quite know what's coming next, or who the malign force truly is. Some truly unsettling and disturbing scenes, it's not a horror in the conventional sense, the scares are not cheap, but very poignant. Very good performance from the cast, Ralph Inseson and Kate Dickie in particular. On occasion the dialogue sounded a little flat, but it was in keeping with the setting of the movie.Very watchable."
" Flawed but intriguing
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,6,"THE WITCH is a well-regarded slice of historical horror set in Puritan America in 1630. The plot follows a single farming family as they relocate to the woods to raise their children and livestock, only to find their lives blighted by hints of witchcraft. That this film works for the most part is because it takes a realistic approach to the material, focusing on the psychology of the characters involved rather than sticking to CGI ghosts or demons or jump scares. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie are reliably good in support, but the main joy here is in the careful, subdued lead performance from Anya Taylor-Joy, who tackles a difficult role and makes it entirely sympathetic. The one thing I dislike about this film is the cheap, depressing digital look, full of greys and browns and blues and little life from beginning to end; this kind of visuality is already a modern horror cliche and it could do with being stamped out. The twist ending is also extremely stupid. Otherwise, check this out."
" ABSOLUTE GARBAGE
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,1,"I'm an avid horror fan and this is NO horror film. Visually pleasing for the first 5 minutes then descended into the most boring, self indulgent pile of puke I've seen since my uncle threw up 2 pizzas and 8 pints after a night at The Elephant and Wheelbarrow.... GARBAGE...DONT BOTHER"
" Very realistic
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,8,"I quite enjoyed the film. Although it was a little slow in my opinion, I thought that it was a great depiction of what actual witchcraft was believed to be about back in that time era. The atomsphere through out the entire film was dark and eerie, which helped shaped the film's main storyline. The acting was believable; entire dialogue was in old English which made it compliament the time of the folklore. Overall a very intriguing film."
" A very unusual Psychological horror
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,9,"The quality of this film is very high, as both the actors and direction are a feast for the eye. The character are executed with a very hard-to-learn 17th century dialect, while still having the emotional debt and impact for it to be scary. The cinematography is something different in terms of ""standard"" filmmaking. This is meant with a context to the movie being bleak and dark, whilst the dialogue and tempo matches the tone. This makes up for some high quality close-ups, long drawn out pans of the scenery, and slowly zooming in with tangering background-music. When it comes to the story, it's so intense and mysterious that it holds the drawn out parts interesting. It's a long and slow movie, but it has a slow burn that sticks in the mind - and is certainly something to analyse on for future viewings."
" Wasn't impressed at all
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,2,"The storyline was very difficult to follow, seemed to be a lot of noise and shouting going on and not really knowing what was happening. Also the dilalogue was really difficult to understand as well. 
Ending made no sense either, was glad it was a short film!"
" This film was so amazing I wrote a song about it

Your mom is nuts. A goat just gored your dad.When you came into the woods, Sam smiled, so a witch took him.I'm dedicating fresh butter to you.
Puritan life, was never quite my style.
When you smile, you knock me out, I want your soul.
And I thought I was so whole.
You will come of age with our young coven.
We'll dance and chant for you, we'll light bonfires for you.If you agree to total damnation

My son?
Look at my son: pride is not the word I'm looking for.
There is so much more inside you now.
Oh Caleb, you puppet of the Dark One!
My son?
When you're possessed, I fall apart.
I can't even blame that tart.
Our savior isn't around...

" I suspect those who gave this only 1 star, are as shallow as mud.
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,8,"This is an amazing movie that I've watched 3 times already. Yes, it is a little difficult to fully understand the actors as they are speaking in an Old English accent, but it just adds to the authenticity. For those who rate it only 1 Star, they never watched the movie, watched only 15 minutes of it, or are the top of guy who loves to jerk off to gun magazines. They would rather see Saw, Saw 2, Saw 3, Saw 4, and so on. Only blood, gore and guts gets these trolls off. Perhaps if they watched it with an open mind, they would appreciate the beauty of this film.This was never about the evil witch in the woods, this was about the cultural and familial pressures that cause an otherwise innocent and good Christian girl to turn bad. A witch may have killed some people she loves, but she isn't turning towards a new family of women or serving the witches, she's turning towards a life of serving herself. Now that she's alone, she can be free, and must do something to save herself. Rules did nothing for her, and now she will live without them. This is a movie about how you make witches, and the woman on the movie posters and dvd case is not the witch coming from the woods to do harm, it's Thomasin walking into the dreaded wild, away from God, away from oppressive, controlling Puritan society, and away from the bitter, painful life of pioneers and colonists that has won her nothing but loneliness, hunger, and abuse. The movie closes on her ecstatic face as she literally defies the rule of gravity, for the first time totally, completely free."
" A poem with elements of horror
",2018-02-09 00:00:00,9,"I find this movie very poetic. The nature is beautiful. The forest and the river near the family home add to the romantic feeling of the movie.
I love the small moments of suspense throughout the movie that make the viewer think who is behind the crimes. It took a long time for me to accept the supernatural aspect of the story but, as it turns our, fits perfectly in it.
The ending is one of the best I've seen in any horror movie."
" Eerie and Creepy.... but...
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,6,"The atmosphere of this film is stellar. The setup of the family being ousted from their village and heading into the woods to live alone really drives home how incredibly lonely it must have been for many people back then. Without regular contact with others, some families only interacted with each other. This film sets up the extreme version of that, with the family deep in the woods. It is bleak and disturbing, even before anything supernatural happens. The acting is good, but it lacked the depth of character development that I needed to really care about the characters. Rather than feeling emotionally invested, I just felt like, ""Hmm, that's interesting."" And it often was. Though at times it was also quite slow. For such a hyped film, I though much of the critical lavish praise was overdone, but it's always nice to see a low-budget indie film breakout."
" Amazing
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,"If you understand film making this is with out a doubt a master piece of film making. Kubrick-ish directing style, great music score and cinematography and acting! If your looking for action, special effects and car crashes move on."
" You're Not Going to Forget This Any Sooner!
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,7,"Personally, I prefer describing this as a ""classic horror movie"", I find the events so real and significant, also the casting was good especially the parents, The soundtrack was going slowly with events which were appropriate and uncomfortable at some points. in a nutshell, if you're into realist horror movies this might be the one!
The screenplay could've been better than that."
" Pray for thy brother
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,5,"His is a film I did not enjoy as much as my peers. It is based on folk tales from the era. A family is banished and lives on the outskirts of the forbidden forest. Their infant son goes missing and the crops fail. Dad and son go hunting and trapping in the woods. Dad is great at chopping wood, but hunting and farming doesn't go his way. There are no Native Americans in 1630 New England.The daughter is coming of age and the son eyes her, although that doesn't seem to be an issue. Mom is overbearing and the family is preoccupied in blaming each other and the devil and accusing each other to the point I got nauseated with the whole thing. Oh yea, there is a witch in it, I think, unless it was imagination from eating bad mushrooms or something. I kept waiting for the film to get interesting and then it was over. If you like slow burn, I mean really slow burn, then this is it.The film is a sewn together collection of tales into one so cohesiveness was not a great quality, until the very end which made an attempt to tie it all together in a me-so-clever ending. It didn't make up for the rest of the film. It reminded me of a bad production of ""The Village.""This is perhaps more of an art house film, but it is being marketed as horror. For witch horror I liked ""Cherry Tree"" more than this one.Guide: No swearing or sex. Brief nighttime distant nudity."
" Disappointing!
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,3,"This 2015 horror film takes place in 17th century New England focusing on a Farming family. It begins when one of the children gets taken by an old witch
deep in the woods and then the daughter starts to have a connection with the evil presence which makes her family fear her. What can I say? This starts ok, but declines after even though there are some eerie, creepy and bloody moments. Give this a try if you're into horror, but it's disappointing
in my opinion."
" One of the Best Horrors of 21st Century
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,10,"Writer-Director Robert Eggers' debut film The Witch redefines horror filmmaking. It is not that scary and there is no gore but the atmosphere he creates for the film is so tense that you keep thinking something macabre is going to happen. That, in my opinion, is an achievement. The meaning of Horror has changed over time. Earlier, we had films like Rosemary's Baby, Suspiria and The Shinning which relied heavily on the atmosphere, music, and story rather than monsters behind the closets. But nowadays, almost every single horror film relies on cheap tricks to scare the audience which may or may not be good depending on who you ask it to. These movies are so frantic and desperate to scare the audience that they don't focus on the other elements of the film. Sometimes, it may be effective but most of the time, it isn't. It has become old, cliched and predictable. The most important aspect of a film is storytelling, and if you fail at that, if you sacrifice that, then there's no point in making a film. Fortunately, we have seen some brave attempts in the last few years from some passionate filmmakers. The Babadook, it Follows, and, The Cabin in the Woods were amazing films that were not completely hollow and bereft of emotions. The Witch is another such gem from A24.Based on the Salem Witch trials which took place in the early 17th century, The Witch tells the story of a Puritan family. They (Husband, Wife and Five Children including an infant) are banished from their village over some disagreement with the community. They decide to live at the edge of the Woods thinking of it as a gift from the God, only to find themselves the target of an unnerving terror that lays in the woods. Soon, their infant disappears and things take an ugly turn. Once is starts terrorizing them, they can't make heads and tails of it. Weird things start happening in the midst of this paranoia, the family members turn on each other. Is it the work of a Witch? Are they being hunted by the Devil? Is the God punishing them?Reviewing a film like this is very difficult. Most of the people won't like it because it sells itself as horror and people are going to be disappointed as there isn't much horror in the film, at least not in the way people expect. That is the reason it is rated 6.8 on IMDb whereas the RottenTomatoes ratings are at 91%. People don't like slow movies (most of them). They expect something to happen every second so that they can keep devouring their popcorn. The Witch is completely opposite of that. It will be loved by those who see filmmaking as an expression of art and not just mere entertainment. The Witch excels at technical things and it gets most of the things right. The atmosphere in this film is creepy. I have never seen anything like that in any other horror film.The cinematography is gorgeous. Every frame has been crafted with great precision to aid in building the atmosphere. Some shots are long and the camera keeps zooming in, which kind of makes you feel uncomfortable and uneasy. The camera does not make any sudden movements, it moves slowly, zooming in, zooming out, immersing you in this whole madness. The greyish color grading makes everything look lifeless and bleak, which adds to the horror element. The shots in the woods often include the actors at the bottom half so the trees look enormous, symbolizing how insignificant and helpless the family really is. The walks in the woods make up for some really tense moments.In one of the early shots, the camera shows the family sitting on the ground and praying. They think their prayers have been answered and they have found a perfect place to settle down. Then the camera keeps zooming in towards the woods before fading into black, almost soaking you in this inevitable dread and hysteria that follows. It's scenes like this that make The Witch an absolute joy to watch.Some choices are very interesting and thoughtful. During one of the scenes, we see Thomasin (Anya Taylor Joy) and her brother Caleb (Harvey Scrimshow) sitting near a pond. This scene serves two purposes. It shows that there is a pond/creek nearby where they get their water from. It also tells you more about the story. I can't spoil what happens during this scene but it is there for a reason. Also, look at the color grading and how grey things look.The night scenes are filmed with the minimal use of artificial lights. Most of the time, candles are used and the scenes are dimly lit. You can't help but think about something evil lurking in the dark. It is the fear of that unknown that scares you. It also results in some beautifully crafted shots such as the one attached below.
the witch hauntingBut that being said, the most frightening character in The Witch is the atmosphere. Especially, The woods which is the resting place for the witches and other devilish things. That is what makes it relentlessly terrifying. Just take a look at the below pic for example. Thomasin (Anya Taylor Joy) is stuck in the woods and it is starting to frighten her. The Cinematographer captures that feeling of dread by filming the huge trees in the background. He does not show the full view. Not knowing how high the trees go and how deep the woods are is what scares us. She looks helpless as everything seems much bigger than her.This whole atmospheric treatment results in the feeling of paranoia, which will linger with you till the end. It also does not shy away from filming some vomit-inducing scenes.The other important aspect of The Witch that helps build the atmosphere is the music. It perfectly complements the visuals and adds another layer of horror to it. We must thank Mark Korven for that. The music in the Witch is spooky and terrifying. I can't find the perfect words to describe it but it scared me more than the visuals. The music during the climax scene is so intense that I do not think I have a heart strong enough to download that soundtrack. The best way to describe it would be - Think of all the sounds from your scariest nightmares and put them all together in a single clip. It is dissonant and pretty unique. It will not give you jumpscares but is unsettling, nonetheless. You will keep thinking about it long after you've seen the film, that is if you are into music and know what good music means. It captures the whole essence of the film.Talking about acting, everyone is pretty solid but the child actors steal the show. They make the film what it is. half of the time I wanted to kick them because they irritated me beyond my tolerance limit and that is what the director was trying to do. Anya Taylor Joy is great as Thomasin. The father and mother are equally good. Harvey Scrimshaw has delivered a brilliant performance as Caleb, the son who is guilty about commiting a sin. His acting in this film blows everything Adam Sandler has ever done, away. How could he be so good?Eggers' direction is solid throughout the film. His storytelling abilities are amazing. He calls The Witch, A New England Folktale and that is what he turned it into. The tension and atmosphere in this film are what I expect from a horror film. It maintains the same atmosphere throughout the film and never lets go. It all builds up to an ending that hits you like a hammer to the face. I bet no one will be able to guess the ending. At first, I thought it was not that great. But the more I think about it, the more sense it makes.The reason I hold The Witch in such a high regard is because after watching the film, I had a feeling that I had consumed something evil and it was disturbing my inner-peace. Despite sharing my thoughts about the film, I am still not sure why I liked it so much that it may be one of my favourite horror films of all time. I guess, that's what good movies do to you. You don't know why you love them. One more thing that baffles me is how well researched the whole thing is. They even used the old English which is a bit difficult to grasp even with subtitles, especially for non-native speakers. But it results in a realistic film.The Witch is a film made with passion, by a passionate filmmaker, for passionate Cinephiles who don't mind an artistic horror film. It's not easy to watch and most of the people won't like it since they'll be expecting jump scares but if pulverizing babies is your thing then, do give it a try because it is a masterpiece of Horror filmmaking. I didn't like it as much in the first viewing but it kept making me think about it and now that I have seen it around 6 times, I can say that it is one of the best horror movies of the 21st century.I doubt anyone is going to make a horror film like that in the near future.P.S - If jump scares are your thing and you hate artistic films then leave it. It isn't scary."
" Drama
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,7,"I just watched this Film and no way would I call it scary , maybe horror but not scary. . I enjoyed the story and actors and settings were good . I would call it a supernatural drama with some horror . As a story it's a bit depressing, as here is a innocent Family who are a good Family beset by Evil and the Devil , as a none believer I have to say where was God ? I would rather have seen a good versus Evil thing with Good beating Evil with a happy ending, as the message I got from this is if this can happen to them what chance have the rest of us got . Another thing that always gets me in these stories of someone selling their Soul to the Devil is what's the point if all you get is to skulk around naked in the Woods ."
" Occasional suspense with a bit of a mind-numbing plot
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,5,"I cannot help put feel disappointed after seeing this film. I wasn't expecting a gore-fest nor did I wish for it, but I was missing more of The Witch. I feel like the movie was more or less just running around without any actual thrill or horror. The acting was okay and the plot was okay, but just that. And that's not enough, at least for me. The ending result gave the movie total of 5 starts instead of 4, thank god for even that. Seen it, glad it's over."
" Good and Not So Good
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,6,"At the beginning and until the end the movie had me very interested. Once the dad died I was starting to get annoyed. A lot of questions went unanswered... What's the deal with the witch in the woods? What happened to the twins? Where did the black goat come from? The rest I could pretty much deal with. It was suspenseful and very interesting. Great screenplay and acting, but I was let down in the end. Too many unanswered questions. It felt a lot like The Village, but that movie made more sense in the end. Unless there's a follow-up movie that will explain everything, I didn't much care for this one."
" i genuinely felt i saw something evil
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,8,"(THIS MOVIE IS UNDER RATED) 
This film is all about mood and atmosphere. when people generally talk about atmosphere i did not really get what they were talking about. but when i was watching this film..... oh boy i got first hand experience what an atmosphere is. it really sets the mood and gets under your skin.
caution ; this movie builts up slowly. its not about jump scares like in your regular horror movies. horror is in the atmosphere. it is genuinely creepy.
i saw many mmovies about witches. they all toned it down to flying on broomstick and creepy laughs. but not this one , set in 17th century england, it shows what a witch real witch is at that time. 
P.S. it has some really creepy scary and disgusting images. NOT FOR WEAK HEARTS."
" Disturbing and scary
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,8,"""The Witch"" is one of those types of horror movies that doesn't rely on cheap jump scares or sexual content to be a success. No, this is one of those unsettling and terrifying horror movies. This particular film has an excellent cast with Anya Taylor-Joy, Ralph Ineson, and Kate Dickie carrying the film. Because the film is set in 17th century New England, it is quite hard to understand what is being said a lot of the time, but that is what makes this movie work in a sense.The film is basically about a Puritan family who are told they are banished from their own village because they violated some religious rule that we are not told of. They end up moving to a small farm in the woods with a horse and several goats. Well, from there, things start going downhill. Their baby goes missing, presumably snatched by a wolf, but the children think something more sinister is going on. Supernatural disease also strikes when Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) goes missing, but comes back in an apparent possessed state of mind. The film is terrifying and suspenseful, and absolutely nothing is cheesy about it. It is actually quite mysterious, too. Is it a wolf? Is it a witch? Is it a demonically possessed goat? Is it Thomasin? Give this one a watch. I'm going to rate it 8/10."
" Short review for impatient viewers
",2017-12-08 00:00:00,6,"The acting in the movie was excellent. Especially the kids, they were amazing and very realistic. However I feel like the story line could be improved. There wasn't a solid story in the movie. The character development was not that good. We didn't get to know much about characters. This was a perfect opportunity to create a horror masterpiece but they let it slide away. I give this move 6 out 0 because of the perfect acting and visuals. If you are impatient like me i definitely advice you to watch this movie because everything happens fast enough.Follow me on Instagram @punkifex"
" Original but overrated
",2017-12-08 00:00:00,6,"I first heard about this film on youtube. It would often pop up in reviews and top lists. I recommend you not to believe the hype and watch the movie with an open mind. Otherwise you risk being disappointed like I was. The source material for this movie is amazing. Folktales are a horror goldmine and it's a shame you don't see it being used so often. The movie draws you in with it's original concept and stetting. The approach to horror itself is very unorthodox in the sense that most horror movies nowadays rely on obscurity or grotesque visuals. This movie shows horror in broad daylight, the camera is steady, there are no monsters, no gore. So what good is it? - Realism. Especially in the supernatural scenes. The rawness of theses scenes is the best part. You're always asking yourself 'is this superstition or is this real?' and 'who is the real villain?'. Of course that's until the charm is ruined by the bullshit ending where those questions are answered in the worst way possible. If they left room for speculation and stuck to the subtle approach I would've given this film a 6 or a 7. 'The Witch' had some good ideas but it's far from perfect. I feel sorry for people who claim that this movie is some 'masterpiece'. Apparently they've been watching only shitty movies this whole time. The cinematography was dry and even felt effortless. I liked the composition in only one shot: the dinner prayer. The picture lacks tonal contrast to compensate the lack of color. It just fails at grasping your attention. Only parts where the dryness benefits the movie are the horror scenes, all the other shots are just tedious and repetitive. Sorry, but it needs to have style or at least some visual value before it can qualify as a 'masterpiece'. The actors did a great job. My favorite was Kate Dickie as Katherine who I think came off as more threatening then the actual witch. You can tell that 'The Witch' was heavily inspired by Stanley Kubrick's work (sadly Eggers doesn't take notes from his shot composition though). Not only has it similar motives to 'The Shining' but also a soundtrack that resembles Ligeti's 'Requiem' form '2001 Space Odyssey'."
" 'The Witch' proves low-budget scares are still possible
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,7,"It's rare these days that we see the hysteria and fear that gripped 17th century New England captured on the big screen, but the low-budget 'The Witch' does so in a way that is simple yet chilling.The story follows a devout family of seven who settle in the wilderness of Massachusetts just in time for things to fall apart. A series of unfortunate events ensue shortly after they take up residence, including the disappearance of the youngest family member (a baby boy), infighting among multiple family members and accusations of deceit and witchcraft. Of course, the latter is what drives the majority of the film, as the young children Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Granger and Lucas Dawson) accuse their eldest sister Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) of the act. Taylor-Joy dominates with her performance, which is not an easy feat considering the film is so depending on acting compared with other elements.One way 'Witch' succeeds is it is not overt or over the top in what it shows (at least, for the most part). Most of what gives the audience chills is not seen on screen, but it instead implied. Although, the use of devices such as the family's black billy goat is a creative way to send shivers down spines. Another aspect that works well is the gray scale filming style that's used. The coolness of the color used conveys the damp, dark atmosphere and harshness of the environment in an effective way.To be sure, there are a good deal of disturbing parts in 'Witch.' Some of the scenes are difficult to watch, but again, a lot more is hinted at than is actually shown. Near the film's finale, things unwind at a rapid rate, but this is the culmination of a slow build to the climax.'The Witch' is not a masterpiece, nor is it one of the more memorable films of its kind to come out in the past few years. But it's a good example of how low-budget efforts can find an audience and rival their much more sophisticated, pricey peers."

" Intriguing but fatally flawed
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,5,"I found this film very interesting if viewed as a psychological thriller rather than a horror film about witches, even though the director is reported to have said he meant it to be interpreted literally. I imagined somebody from the plantation finding the scene of horror at the family farm, the missing children, or perhaps even finding Thomasin raving in the woods, and explaining it in the only way that would have made sense to simple 17th century peasants. It was easy to understand that the family, alone in an unfamiliar and scary wilderness, could have terrified each other into believing anything, compounded by extreme hunger, which would have led them to try eating any plants they could find, including psychotropic mushrooms, as well as the ergot which is overtly shown on the failed maize crop. For me, that is why the scene at the witch's hut with the stolen baby was disappointing. Imposing the third person narrative viewpoint made it too obvious that this was supposed to be taken literally and couldn't be read as the hallucinogenic ravings of insane minds - unlike all the other diabolic appearances in the film.However, the real big flaw in this movie which has made me reduce my rating drastically from the 9 it would otherwise have received was the appalling diction of the actors, which made the dialogue almost inaudible in places. Perhaps the younger cast members have not been taught how to project their voices to allow the whole audience to hear what they have to say, but I have seen Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie in other things so I know they are perfectly capable of making themselves understood, so it must have been a directorial decision to get them to mumble their lines so they were barely comprehensible.What a terrible decision that was. What a pity as well, when obviously such a lot of effort went into making the dialogue sound as authentically seventeenth century as possible. What is so great about this trendy habit of directors to not want the audience to be able to hear what the characters have to say? Are they embarrassed by the weakness of the script? Or do they think it adds some kind of bogus authenticity to the story or the characters? Whatever, it is really annoying.In the case of this film, it was only after I read a synopsis on Wikipedia afterwards that I found that I had missed some crucial plot elements, such as that Black Philip talked to the twins, or that Thomasin was to be sent away to live elsewhere, because I simply could not understand the dialogue.Ironically, I watched this straight after seeing I, Daniel Blake and the contrast was stark. Every word of that movie was clear to understand, despite the fact that most of the characters spoke in broad geordie accents. For that matter, I don't recall ever seeing a Coen Bros movie where they had to resort to this ""mumble your words to make your character seem interesting"" style of directing."
" Horrific, unintentionally
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,2,"Awful movie, no redeeming qualities (except for Black Phillip).I know we all have different tastes in movies, but this movie has nothing to offer. Positive reviews I have read just seem to be based on the reviewer interpreting something in the movie that was simply not there! May as well have watched static and made the same interpretations.Please don't waste your time on this movie, far better artsy-type horror movies out there that actually have something to offer, such like; ""The Devil's Candy"" and ""February"""
" A masterpiece of both archaic drama, colonial representation, and psychological horror
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie immediately struck me as what the result of a Shakespeare & Brothers Grimm collaboration would look like. The film is like a beautifully embroidered tapestry, with an interestingly somber & sullen style & theme, and surprising authenticity. The most notable & well structured aspect of this film is the design of the early 17th century set. All the actors speak in an old, yet recognizable English. You likely won't understand half of what the characters are saying unless you've studied Shakespeare. The somber and misty feel of 17th century New-England is captured in a beautifully perfect & realistic fashion. The actors clothing, manner of speech, and heavily religious mindset is accurate to that of 17th century New-England that the movie uses as its setting. The film does a good job of making a statement about how hard it was to be alive in the 1620's, and that these peoples lives were never easy. Even if you're someone who's never studied the hardships of this historical era, or the lifestyle of settlers in the new world, the film gives you a powerful impression that it was extremely hard to be alive in this time. (It accurately captures the grueling lifestyle, while it also remains true to what witches were believed to be in this time)The first glance at the forest is chilling. The battalion of impenetrable trees seem to pulse with a ominous intent, and the portrayal of 17th century witches is both deeply disturbing, and unnervingly accurate. The witches on-screen moments, and her actions throughout the movie have an overpoweringly gripping effect on the audience, as the witches presence and potency seems to span over the entire forest, and echo a dark omen for the poor family of seven that resides by the forest side.The film is frightening in a rather subtle way. (mostly after the ending, which resolves all the disturbing occurrences in a solemnly saddening conclusion, which has the most powerful effect on the audience) Robert Eggers immaculately designs a thick, omnipresent tension which further contributes to an increasingly uncanny atmosphere. The film conveys a unique design of horror that's chillingly unfamiliar these days, (but not absent) and deviates from the unusual expectations from an average horror film. (That being said, this is most definitely not an average horror film. (In a good way) I mostly enjoyed this film as a piece of genuine art and as a folktale. If what you desire from a horror movie is jump- scares, gory images, and creepy faces, (Or most of what the horror genre is producing today) rather than a layered and deeply soul-shaking story, than this movie is most definitely not for you.) The film is scariest to those who think deeply about it, and those who understand the 17th century folklore, and the importance of faith in this time, since the film is also frightening at a religious angle. The audience can do nothing but watch as the families faith is questioned and attacked by theirs God's absence in their suffering, and as the family is plagued, tormented, and (figuratively) torn to shreds by the deceitful & manipulating hand of the evil that resides amongst the trees. Thus, the events of this movie are a perfect presentation of a Puritan's worst nightmare. Some of the most frightening & disturbing implications are hidden behind seemingly innocuous, yet slightly sinister things. And some of the most saddening, most horrific implications are hidden beyond the ending, leaving contemplation and speculation on the viewers mind for days or weeks after. While each time you recommence speculation of post-movie events, you also remember how well the film captured your subconscious in its quintessential design of psychological haunts, and you're reminded of the depth of this profoundly powerful story. Robert Eggers combines these layers of subtle horror with expert film-making to create a truly nerve racking story about religious paranoia & familial trauma.I felt like the full impact of the movie didn't strike me right away. But as I thought and thought (which I guarantee you will) about the plot and the genuinely saddening conclusion, the film started to grow & gnaw at my thoughts until I realized the sheer magnitude of depth & meaning of what I had watched. There is Biblical symbolism scattered throughout the run-time, a perfect display of how religion ruled the lives of people living in this time, and some much deeper elements that I cannot reveal without spoiling major plot points. But overall, this film is a masterpiece, as a horror, a drama, and as a film in general. Everything about it is executed in a perfect design, and the unbelievably disturbing ending will shake you to whatever is at your core."
" Simply boring
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,2,"Take this review for what it's worth. It was super boring and attempting to be too artsy. Couldn't make it past 5 minutes. Too much effort spent, in the opening, trying to make it weird and odd. Only reason it didn't get a 1 was because my other 1 rankings were just slightly worse."
" Intensely Atmospheric, With Great Performances.
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,7,"A failing farm family who has recently immigrated to New England, has hit particularly hard times and have become desperate. They have 6 mouths to feed, most of their crops are inedible, the father can't hunt worth sh*t, and they have recently lost a baby to either a wolf or a witch.The aging mother holds a grudge against her youthful daughter, Thomasina- if only using her as someone to take her anger out on for being stuck desolate in this god forsaken new land. So, she seeks to have her sent away to become someone else's problem.After overhearing this, the two older siblings set off to do something that is never specifically said. And, while they are out, their horse gets spooked, Thomasina falls off and is knocked unconscious.She wakes up alone, and makes her way back to the farm. Caleb, it seems, has gone to a house in the woods...the house of a witch...and become bewitched through lust.He returns naked, in the rain, pecked in the face.The Twins (two younger siblings) blame Thomasina, because she had jokingly told them she was a witch to scare them when they were being brats. But they took it seriously...and blame her.Even though it really seems like they (the twins) are the ones doing the bewitching, considering they are the ones talking to their creepy goat Black Phillip.Either way, Caleb has a demon in him. And they attempt to perform a farmhouse exorcism on him as best they can...during which he coughs up an apple and dies.To appease his terrified wife, the father locks the rest of the children away with the goats. Hoping that will contain the problem till morning. At which point he will take his daughter to the local plantation. But sh*t hits the fan, before morning has a chance to roll around. The twins are stolen by some nasty naked witch, and Black Phillip gets loose...goring their father to death.Now, only the mother is left, and she immediately attacks her daughter...ignoring her own godly premonition...turning against the only one who is left...the only one who is truthful, and good.And there is only one thing you can do when you're getting choked to death...This film is very atmospheric, and does a great job of putting you in a position of empathy with Thomasina- who we are, sort of, experiencing events through.But what really stands out, are the performances. For a period piece, with lots of Olde English (I had to watch with subtitles), everyone does a spectacular job. Ralph Ineson probably does the best job, as the father- it's like he stepped right out of the 1700's. The twins are both creepy as all hell- their unison responses send chills down your spine. Harvey Scrimshaw's portrayal of a bewitched and possessed Caleb is simply mindblowing, coming from such a young dude. And Anya Taylor-Joy's portrayal of Thomasina is absolutely genuine, on a purely human level. The ending, however, is very abrupt. And left me wanting more. I felt they could have stretched the film a bit longer, and used that to develop her initiation more.But it's not my film, so who am I to complain.Thoroughly enjoyed this.7 out of 10."
" Scared But Absolutely Satisfied
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,8,"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!!We are told an age-old folk tale about a witch as it would have been understood by the Puritan psych in 1630's New England, as absolutely true. And it is told oh so horrifically through the chilling crescendos of musician Mark Korven, the beautiful cinematographic direction of Robert Eggers, the big acting performance of a small cast, and the unnerving hidden messages of the plot. Even hours after the credits stopped rolling, my mind was still trapped in the unwelcoming atmosphere of this 1630's world. For effectively rattling my peace of mind, I give The Witch an 8/10.Let me first give a well-earned applause to the cast, especially to the two actors who play the older siblings. Harvey Scrimshaw, who is a new coming child actor, illustrates the curiosity of a growing boy and gives a possessed performance I will never forget. And Anna Taylor-Joy, who plays the center character, was given more room than the other actors because of the ambiguous role her character was supposed to portray, and own it completely. As for the music, it does it's job right from the get go. In the first 5 minutes of the film there is a moment where the music crescendos during a slow-moving shot of the family praying on their new settlement. It successfully makes a boring backdrop of trees seem like a sinister hell-trap. This was one of the many moments where the soundtrack was successful in creating an atmosphere that screams (sometimes literally) there is something bad going on here. But this atmosphere would not have been so successful if it wasn't for the cinematographic choices of Eggers that makes the horrors ever palpable. My favorite was that of restricted narration, where we are held in suspense guessing what our main character's faces are witnessing, we become eager yet terrified to see the truth. But what really made this movie deeply unsettling for me was that the monster to be feared was not just the witch, but also the urge of the main characters to resort to hasty generalization in regard to who the witch was. Thomasin does not fit into the idealized feminine of her time and place--one who is to never question ""thy"" father (or any patriarch), is to never dare even think about disobeying the religious doctrines of Puritan faith, is to be sent off to serve another family upon reaching physical maturity, and is to bear children and clean. It is consistently inferred that Thomasin urges to cross the borders placed on her by her world (family, societal, and religious world). Her opposition to her role combined with the fact that she is a young woman, made her a the likely witch in her family's Puritan eyes. As a result of the continued stifling of her freedom, suppression of her creativity, and the rejection of her by her own mother and father (and the stressors of having to live on a dying farm in the middle of nowhere) she was desperate for acceptance and comfort. She was a perfect target for Satan to lure into signing away her soul. I was deeply unnerved by this movie because our main protagonist eventually became the witch her family unlovingly and falsely blamed her of being."
" I am the Witch of the Wood
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,6,"Robert Egger's 2015 film, The Witch, centers around a family in 1630s New England that begins turning on each other after the disappears of the youngest son, Samuel. This film falls into the genre of horror and mystery, and discusses supernatural phenomena of witchcraft. After the family is banished from their religious plantation, they set out on their own and begin to cultivate a new farm. This leaves the family isolated and their only sense of reality is that which they can plainly see. With no outside witnesses to the horrors that occur, their only truth is based on past assumptions and leaps in logic. To find meaning behind these horrible events, the members of the family begin suspecting one another of witchcraft. For this reason, the film serves as a social commentary on fear and how it negates reason. It also brings up the importance of perception as all ""evidence"" points toward one character.The scene leading to the infant, Samuel's, abduction shows Thomasin, the eldest daughter, playing peak-a-boo with Samuel. This innocent game foreshadows how Thomasin will be made the villain after Samuel's disappearance. She continually says ""boo"", and later the other members of the family begin to fear her. While the main archetype shown in the boogeyman, the film also uses the archetype of light vs dark. Particularly, the woods act as the dark, in which mysterious events occur. No one truly knows what is happening, and therefore are literally ""in the dark"". The farm is in an open field and acts as the light. The environment of the farm then mirrors the situation of the characters, which is shown through cinematography. At times, I found the plot to be unclear, particularly toward the end of the film. The resolution therefore did not seem complete. The left me, the audience member, dissatisfied, especially because this film is a mystery. For this reason, I would rate this film a 6/10."
" Wonderfully atmospheric and historically accurate take on witch mythology in colonial New England
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,10,"The Witch: A New-England Folktale (2015) is an entertaining, wonderfully atmospheric and historically accurate take on witch mythology in colonial New England. Plenty of films claim historic accuracy, but you rarely see it. Mel Gibson is notorious for his pseudo historical (but highly entertaining) historical fiction movies. The Witch, though a semi-low budget horror film, puts those to shame. Listen to what the director says about his attention to detail.""I am positive it is the most accurate portrayal of this period in American history on screen. We went to such lengths to make it so,"" writer-director Robert Eggers told the LA Times earlier this year. ""Everything with the farmstead that we built, everything that you see on-screen is made from the correct building materials that would have been used at the time. Most often we used the traditional tools and techniques to create these objects. And the clothing is hand stitched based on extant clothing."" OK, except the nails, which are round and not square like they would have been in the seventeenth century.Nitpickers have also gone after the filmmaker's stylized title. Cinema Sins' claim that the digraph ""VV"" fell out of use after the sixteenth century (The Witch is set in the seventeenth century), and therefore the stylized use of VV in the title is inaccurate, is only partly true.The Wonders of the Invisible World by Cotton Mather, published in 1693, clearly shows witch spelled with a digraph. However, it is a ""double U,"" or UU. Several other pamphlets, shown here, from 1643 and 1645, both show witch spelled ""V Vitch,"" just like the film title. Printing at the time was more art than science, and printers chose when to use the modern W or the older VV or UU.Even the witch lore is highly accurate to the seventeenth century, from using baby's blood as flying ointment, to enchanted animals cursing weapons in order to slip away unharmed. And, of course, writing one's name in blood in the Devil's book, creepily portrayed by a black goat. Witches were believed to cause their victims to vomit foreign objects, shown when the family's son, Caleb is being tormented and spits up an apple. There are no magic wands, pointy hats, or broomsticks here.Witches represented a malevolent force in the natural and social order, destroying relationships between neighbors and family members. In The Witch, tragedies and minor transgressions gradually unravel the family and undermine the trust that held them together. The tension is palpable as they slowly turn on each other, all while apparently under supernatural assault. The terror comes from knowing this threat destroys from within as well as from without.In many ways The Witch reminds me of Eyes of Fire (1983), in which a group of religious dissenters flee to the wilderness only to face assault by supernatural forces in colonial New England. There's something primordial about the hostility of nature, survival, and the union of wood and spirit. The idea that nature is foreign and hostile to man appeals to our basest instincts.I'm not sure I'd agree with Jay from RedLetterMedia that The Witch is the best film to hit theaters in 2016, but it's definitely the best horror movie to come out for a while. It's an incredible first film for writer-director Robert Eggers. I just hope he isn't another M. Night Shyamalan, whose breakout film The Sixth Sense revolutionized the genre, but he went on to make complete garbage for the rest of his career."
" Boring as a horror movie.
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,5,"This review might reveal some details of the story. It is undeniably a good movie, but it fails as a horror one. And I don't mean that because of the lack of gore, it's because throughout the movie, you worry a lot more about the family drama rather than about the Witch herself, which would make it a drama with bits of suspense. I guess we can all agree that a horror movie does not need any gore to be a good one, and sometimes suggested situations scare more than anything that could be shown. But creating too much expectation without delivering anything to the audience, turns the experience into a frustrating one, and at the end of the movie you feel like they owe you something. Don't watch this expecting a horror movie, you won't get one, not exactly."
" A 6.8? Really?
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,1,"I mean to each their own but really? Most of this movie makes no sense, speaking of sense most of this movie i barely can understand the English their speaking, me and my brother both adults couldn't make out half to nearly anything their saying at all! They talk so low and soft and barely speak, sometimes i wonder if their just grunting, or growling, yea a little bloody deaths, the whole no clothes thing at end and they all float to the sky or something i recall its all like what? What is going on in this movie at all, and again what are they saying its English but i barely can hear anything they talk so fast and so soft! I mean literally what is going on in this movie its all over the place, or its just me i guess its alover barely can hear them nude girl floats and in a group of other women at the end and i don't get it Trilogy of terror gets downgradted with a cool doll and creepy rats but this gets a 6.8 ..Shaking my head i really don't get it i really don't."
" Thou will wish thou hadn't wasted thy time on this
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,2,"The plot moves along unbearably slowly for 3/4 of the movie. Half of the things that happen to try to add excitement barely make sense. I kept waiting for it to make sense, but it never did. It's like they picked plot points out of a hat and mashed them all together, whether they made sense or not. You're basically watching people doing mundane everyday things, and then something semi scary would happen because reasons. It's like playing the sims, but only the most boring parts of the game. And the ending made no sense whatsoever."
" Surprised me!
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,7,"The dialogue was a bit annoying (although fitting for the era/genre). For someone who just enjoys a good horror flick without over analyzing, the ending makes the whole movie. I watch it yesterday and I'm still thinking about it! Good quick watch. Just an FYI, it is a bit slow but worth the long haul."
" The Witch, director Robert Eggers' debut film, is an atmospherically terrifying tale of manipulation and paranoia.
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,9,"2016 was a pretty solid year for horror films, with major releases like Don't Breathe and 10 Cloverfield Lane faring well with audiences and critics. While many releases were sequels, prequels, or lazy reboots, there were several that ended up as genuinely scary films. The Witch, an indie gem distributed by A24 (Ex Machina, Swiss Army Man), is one of these, and many people simply haven't heard of it. I'm not going to hide how much I like this movie. It fascinates me. I'm generally not much of a horror fan, but at the end of the day, a good movie is just a good movie.The story takes place in 16th-century New England and follows a Puritan family of seven who have recently been banished from a plantation settlement. Distressed, they set out blindly into the wild, in hopes of building a new home for themselves. When a witch from the nearby forest abducts their youngest, the mother of the family completely snaps, and the rest must try to survive in the untamed wilderness as their relationships and minds deteriorate further. As they grow more paranoid and even accuse the oldest daughter of witchcraft, they threaten to destroy themselves.The pacing of this film has remained its most contentious quality among audiences since its release. The slow and deliberate pacing starkly contrasts the exciting scare-fests that more casual horror fans expect today. Instead, this movie is oppressively tense, refusing to break the mood that it builds at almost any point. What the pacing and atmosphere of this film are able to create is utterly horrifying. The witch herself is introduced to us in just about the most repulsive way possible, and from that point onward, the film essentially builds as an hour-and-a-half nightmare. Without the relief provided by unearned jump scares, the tension from these scenes builds mercilessly and doesn't let up.I also have to be sure to mention the acting in this film. Each member of the family, which serves as most of the cast of the movie, is thoroughly believable, from the parents to the young twins. While children in movies are with rare exceptions painfully hard to watch, both the child and adult actors in The Witch give convincing performances. This is a film featuring many relative unknowns who can remind us that a film doesn't have to be helmed by A-list stars to be effective. In particular, lead actress Anya Taylor-Joy delivered a well-rounded and convincingly emotional performance; I'm excited to see where her career takes her over the next several years.The characters' mutual descent into madness is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 1980 masterpiece The Shining. Visually, they are both exquisitely constructed, though instead of the bright symmetry of the older film, The Witch presents itself visually in a sharp grayness of frank poverty, uncomfortable character closeups, and shrieking nature shots. Honestly, you'll end up afraid of just about everyone and everything in the movie from the paranoia that the visuals help produce and the chilling score of period instruments and melismatic chanting help to fully bring out.There's a terribly vulnerable nakedness to the characters' condition in their small homestead. Protected from the wilderness by a shabby split rail fence, the members of this family appear so cold and fragile. While the titular witch is the villain behind what happens to and between this family, the land around them is so oppressively ambivalent that it become a villain all its own.The film is a surprisingly spiritual film. Christian iconography is common in western horror films, but The Witch is able to meaningfully incorporate otherwise cliché themes and imagery into its narrative. The characters are deeply religious, often praying and quoting scripture, though a good deal of drama and tension derives from how horribly they treat each other in the worst times. By rejecting the joy and forgiveness that is central to the Christian faith, this devout family allows for a very real and present evil to tear them apart. Each of these characters is fast to instruct the others to pray for forgiveness because they refuse to offer it to each other, and in the end, they all suffer horribly.Beyond its strengths as a horror film, The Witch is an undeniable accomplishment of period filmmaking. From the characters' way of life and view of the world to their immediately apparent costumes and speech, most elements of this film are placed and held believably within seventeenth century America. The dialog could have sounded contrived and artificial, and given the inexperience of many of the actors involved, I am impressed by how well it turned out.Director Robert Eggers heavily researched speech, farming, religious attitudes, and more from the time period portrayed in order to authentically transport us there; his efforts paid off. I particularly appreciate his transformation of dialog produced by twentieth century actors into everyday speech of seventeenth century English expats. To my knowledge, the accent that the characters use in the film is accurate to what the English language sounded like at that time. The words used are also largely accurate; Eggers went as far as to incorporate records of actual alleged possessions and bewitchings from around that period in time into scenes in the film. The ease with which these lines fit the rest of the film is a testament to his efforts.It's a shame that because of this movie's pacing and relatively understated scares I can't recommend it to many horror enthusiasts, but that hardly takes away from its artistic quality. The Witch is a testament to what can be accomplished in a film conceived and driven by a passionate and skilled mind. It is proof that there is more to the horror genre today whatever Blumhouse Productions is pumping out this month. Like the best horror films, it exists where fear and helplessness meet and holds you there with it until the screen has gone black."
" My kids loved it!
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,8,"The Witch is a movie about a religious family that works together on a farm and protects each other from evil influences. This is the perfect movie for Christian families like mine! It teaches good morals and the power of family. Your kids will laugh at the funny witch and sing the ""Black Phillip"" song with the adorable twins. My three-year-old son loved the talking goat so much, we had to get him a custom-made stuffed animal, and he sleeps with it every night. My daughter runs around the house naked and pretends to fly just like Thomasin. That brave young lady is such a good role model! My family loved this movie so much, we bought fifty copies and handed them out to all our friends so their kids could enjoy it too!"
" Superb and Stylish
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,8,"I chose this film based on seeing trailers on previous DVDs I had borrowed. The trailers were enticing and intriguing, and I must say, I was not disappointed in taking a chance on this movie. Set in New England in 1630, The Witch is a period piece that evokes the ignorance, superstition and fear endemic to the culture and people of its time. Like Black Death (2010), its mysticism is couched in religion, in this case related to a Puritan family living on the frontier of New England. They leave a town to establish their own ""farm"", thereby creating a profound sense of isolation. Strange events and occurrences begin to take place, many of them explainable so that we as modern people would take them for granted. Each new incident heightens the tension not only for the family, but also the viewer. It's almost as if we're living with them, participating in their daily chores and life's struggles. And bit by bit, we feel the build-up of palpable distrust and suspicion.However, what really makes this movie exceptional is the extreme attention to detail used in its creation. Robert Eggers pulled out all of the stops, starting with four years of exhaustive research. The buildings, structures and sets were built with trees felled in the area, using the same old fashioned tools from that era. The fabric and clothing was created using the same techniques that the Puritans used at that time. Mr. Eggers shot the film in natural light, which makes it appear gray and grainy, adding to its gloomy subtext. And he even imported British nationals to play the roles, believing that the accents would make the production even more authentic.All this being said, this film will probably not appeal to the adrenaline or gore junkies who favor high action zombie and slasher flicks. It's simply not that kind of film. Rather, it is more of a thought provoking movie that explores the uncertainty and unpredictability of a family's journey to a new frontier in a new land."
" A somewhat flat and boring storyline...
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,3,"I had initially looked forward to getting to sit down and watch ""The VVitch"", though it is only 2 years after it was released that I actually got around to do it. I do remember watching the trailer back prior to the movie came out and was intrigued.The story in ""The VVitch"" was plagued by a horribly slow storytelling, and it didn't really help that almost next to nothing happened throughout the course of the entire movie. It was only towards the last quarter of the movie or so, that the movie started to pick up pace and things started to happen.One thing that did work in favor of the movie was the acting performances put on by the cast. The actors and actresses were really doing good jobs with their given roles, despite having a limited script and storyline to work with.There was a really good and realistic atmosphere to the movie, and it definitely seemed like it was quite true to the time period in which the movie was set to take place. And the costume, props and sets were quite convincing, adding a lot of flavor and detail to the movie.""The VVitch"" didn't fall into my liking, because it was just too slow paced, and the ending of the movie didn't sit well with me either. This was somewhat of an acquired taste of a movie by the hands of writer and director Robert Eggers, and I believe that having an interest in the time period and particular aspect of American history that ""The VVitch"" is set to take place in is a definite must to fully enjoy this movie.One thing that puzzled me was the fact that if you have seen the original trailer to the movie, then you have essentially already seen the entire movie. Everything else is just filler that really doesn't serve much of a purpose to the story."
" Good Movie but could have been better
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,7,I personally do not enjoy slow paced horror movies. The Movie needs to have tension throughout and the events need to occur faster than you expect. The Movie has a breath-taking ending. It really leaves you with an impact. But you need to go through a lot of slow scenes where nothing much happens.The Acting is fantastic.. Anya Taylor-Joy looks awesome and acts well.
" Time is precious don't waste it
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,1,"The worst recent movie I have ever seen. Utterly dreadful! So boring and over religious.I usually love historical dramas and horror films but it wasn't interesting in the least or scary, just bizarre. The story drags on and on and you get no answers. The stellar reviews its receiving is beyond me. The ending is weird and disturbing. I do NOT recommend this horrid excuse for a movie."
" Slow and boring from start to finish
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,5,"What complete garbage. Every second shot is 20 seconds long of someone walking slowly, or just standing still. Just complete garbage. The kind of movie where I paused it half way through and searched on google: ""Does The Witch get better?""It doesn't."
" Mind your expectations
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,10,"'The VVitch' is an excellent, and to my mind, a perfectly genius horror movie, which isn't at all reliant on cheap horror movie clichés and tricks like loud sound jump scares, tremendous amounts of blood and gore or unbelievable ghost stories, no - it sets an amazingly creepy and suspenseful atmosphere, accompanied by a terrific score and wonderful cinematography. Everything about this movie is on point and well made, it succeeds in everything it wants to be - the main idea of the movie is quite original and it is brilliantly executed.What I meant by ""mind your expectations"" is that some people might watch the movie expecting to see a gore-fest and an insane witch terrorizing people, but that isn't the case. The witch's character is so well-built and written - she's not your typical horror movie monster going about killing off people, on the contrary - we rarely get to see her and she's basically a part of the terrifying atmosphere, we don't see her but, we're still afraid of her and so are the characters. They don't even know for certain whether she exists and that's one of the reasons that their family breaks apart.Anyway, I loved this movie and everything about it - the cinematography is beautiful, the screenplay is brilliant, the acting is top-notch and the atmosphere is absolutely horrifying - exactly how a true horror film should be.If you'd like to read a full review on 'The VVitch' check out my blog: http://entomorphis.blogspot.bg/2017/07/the-vvitch-borkos- movie-review.html"
" Thick with atmosphere (and accents)
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,9,"While watching this film I knew it would be one of those movies that divides the critics and fans. The Witch is slow paced and trudges along with a sense of dread and despair to the point of making one feel uncomfortable but mixed in are some beautiful shots, amazing sound design, and a truly haunting story of family who gets more then they bargained for.The Witch does focus more on the psyche and effects that belief in the supernatural can cause but does not let you down by saying that it's all just make belief. Instead of a cutesy girl or a wicked old lady with a big nose we see the dark and evil side of giving ones soul to the devil and the repercussions that it brings. A truly terrifying movie with less scares but more horror than most other films."
" Rapid Fire Review of The Witch.
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,10,"This is going to be a quick review, usually I like to go more in-depth in my reviews, but everything that can be said about The Witch has been said. So these are my quick thoughts.The Witch is a masterpiece. It's what true horror is all about, it has a fantastic story alongside amazing acting. the film is accompanied with a brilliant brooding atmosphere, that is filled with absolute dread, that seeps into your very bones. This for me is the best Horror film in the last twenty years. It's far beyond the offerings of today's 'Horror' the Blumhouse type jump scare, poorly edited assembly line of crap films.The biggest problem with this film, is the audience, people tend to go into this film not understanding what type of film to expect. Most people I know thought it was going to be a Conjuring type film. It's so much more then that, this is the type of horror that belongs in the 1970s. Robert Eggers had full creative control to do what he wanted. You just don't get that sort of freedom today, and despite it being his debut feature he absolutely knocked it out of the park. The Witch is a far cry from the usual copy and paste, play it safe jump scare horror, which in my opinion isn't at all scary. This film reminded me of Horror classics like Rosemary's Baby, Don't Look Now and even Ken Russell's The Devils. Like those classics this is true horror that gets under your skin and stays there. The Witch is a wonderful piece of pure cinema!"

",2017-07-25 00:00:00,1,"Extremely dull, if you enjoy watching horror films, or any films, this is not for you. I still don't understand what happened, mainly because I couldn't understand what the characters were saying most of the time and also because I was distracted by paint drying on the wall. Really, really boring with no pay off at the end and not in the least bit scary."
" WTF is this.
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,1,"This movie is masterpiece of piece turd, not only the title so ""engaging"" budged is well spend on last scene of the movie. These kinda movies shines best on how awful religions is. The only thing that was researched was how people talk that is it. Worse kind of story telling..."
" WTF is this..?
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,1,"This movie is kinda special for me. I was searching the web for a good horror movie, then suddenly I found this masterpiece so I went to TPB and downloaded this schnitzel, turned it on and saw the greatest aspect ratio ever. 4million dollar budget and cant even get a half-arsed camera. I hope everyone will enjoy this Christian piece of turd and I will see you next time on dragon ball z."
" Really sticks with you
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,7,"This movie is boring, but in a good way. It's about a Puritan family that turns on each other, after they think their daughter is a witch. It turns out a real witch, and the Devil himself were behind the whole ordeal in order to gain another member of their coven. I can see why some people have a problem with this movie, it is rather boring. If you went expecting to see a truly terrifying movie, than I wouldn't blame you if you were disappointed. I happen to find out that it was a slow-burn, and I think I was able to appreciate it much more. The biggest complaint I have with this movie is the dialogue from the dad. Grant it, it is historical to the time being. I had no problem when anybody besides the dad spoke. The dad was impossible to understand, not because of the words he uses, but because of the deep, grunting accent he speaks with. It honestly got frustrating, I had to rewind, and put subtitles on. What is fantastic about this movie, is the cinematography, atmosphere, and the acting is surprisingly good for dealing with so many kid actors. The main girl was excellent, and have a feeling she will be a household name. The movie has an extremely dark, gritty, and depressing feel. Which I think is what they were going for. The ending was the best part, truly one of the better twist endings I have ever seen."
" A Defining Witch Film
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,7,"A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.There are not many films about witches (as opposed to other horror villains). There are even fewer that are actually rather good. And also very few set in the time when witches were still very much believed to exist in the real world. This film is not only very good, but crafts an entire world -- a Salem-ish environment where it is not hysteria but reality.While there is not much that could be said bad about this film, there is one thing I would like to single out above all else fr praise. The sound design. Wow. The colors, the costumes, the acting and more are all good, but this film is very rich in sound in ways hat we very rarely hear. Not just in horror but anywhere, and it is a real shame that movies like this are not often noticed by the Academy."
" Peep This Reviews
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,8,"To class this a horror film is misleading. It's tag-line is ""A New England Folktale"" and that sums it up perfectly. Yes there are elements of horror and yes there is a witch but this is more of a drama than a horror flick. It's an exceptionally well made movie and worth watching but if you're more of a jump scare/gore fan this may not be the movie for you. If you want a really good folktale that's creepy than it doesn't get better than this."
" Absolutely Brilliant
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,9,"Oh my freaking god, this movie. I've seen it twice now and I'm sure there will be more views in the future. It's just so perfect — a masterpiece, really — and the fact that it is director Robert Eggers' feature film debut makes it even more impressive. The mood, the choice of actors, the historical accuracy, the sort of discordant and frantic music, the tension, the character development, the slow build of a more psychological horror, the setting they just nailed every aspect. The film takes place in 17th century New England and begins with the family — patriarch William (Ralph Ineson), his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), their eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and fraternal twins Jonas (Lucas Dawson) and Mercy (Ellie Grainger) — being banished from their town due to a difference in interpretation of the New Testament. They build a farm by the edge of the woods, where Katherine gives birth to their fifth child, Samuel. When he goes missing, it is just the beginning of the family's descent into all kinds of despair and anguish.** SPOILERS! **The swiftness with which this movie delivers a feeling of all-encompassing hopelessness and isolation — starting just minutes in as we watch Thomasin numbly stare as their wagon heads off towards the woods, away from the town she calls home and from civilization as a whole — is intense. It almost doesn't matter what happens after that point — you feel the frustration contrasting with this stoic, stubborn determination immediately.I was actually impressed that they didn't film on location in New England (due to tax incentives they opted for Canada), but the time Eggers put into finding a suitable location payed off because I easily believed it. The combination of the brilliant soundtrack (done by Mark Korven), the editing, and the cinematography made an otherwise benign forest truly appear ominous, evil even at a distance, which I thought was impressive. I think it can be easy to make woods feel creepy while you're surrounded by them, but to give the impression that there's something sinister hiding within them awesome.They did a great job at keeping the witch herself very subtle — she's scary more for what we don't see than what we do. But the glimpses you DO get are terrifying.After Samuel disappears, Katherine's grief is overwhelming. I feel like so often in movies when a child dies or goes missing, the grief is sort of glossed over — it's implied. But the grief you feel from Katherine absolutely smothers you. It's raw and unapologetic.The film was shot entirely with natural light and damn, it shows. The outdoor shots manage to all be in this perfect, cloudy day light, and the indoor shots lit only by candles are just stunning. All of the indoor shots, really, are beautiful, and they did an amazing job at making the house feel extremely claustrophobic rather than cozy (which cinematographer Jarin Blaschke contributes to the particular aspect ratio used while filming).It's an extremely religious movie but not in a way that offers any form of comfort or warmth. It's more about doing everything in your power to avoid God's punishment rather than to receive his mercy. There's a devoutness, a fierceness, a terrified tightrope walking of self-sacrifice. And as much as it's about religion, it's also about feminism — the quickness to cast evil onto something you don't understand (or something you deem more powerful than it should be). Of course, in the time that this movie took place, women were accused of being witches for the most mundane of offenses — challenging societal norms, having colored skin, or even just being poor — so it's no surprise that Thomasin was quick to be accused by even her own mother, a strong woman in her own right though that power may have been misplaced.One of my favorite scenes, morbidly enough, is when Caleb dies after disappearing into the woods himself and reappearing inexplicably, naked and very ill. It's impressive enough when an adult can put on a convincing show of death in a movie, but when a 14-year-old does it you take notice. But just the sense of their world crashing in around them — first Samuel and now Caleb — and Katherine's hysteria paired with Caleb's intense visions is wild. You're just staring wide-eyed watching the entire scene. And then it follows up with what is probably the most heart-wrenching scene in the whole film — one of the most heart-wrenching I've ever seen — with first a wide shot of Katherine and William burying Caleb, and then Katherine climbing into the grave to hold him one last time. Ooof.William, I think, is one of the most complex characters in the film. He is desperate and mad with conviction but I believe truly trying to help his family the best he's able to. He, too, is like the God they worship — a cold hand on your shoulder reminding you to stay the course, a fierce reminder hissed in your ear.Ultimately, what I think is the best feat of all, is that this film makes no claim to whether it is reality or delusion. There's a brief mention of rot on the corn — so quick you'd likely miss it — and some types of rot can produce hallucinations if consumed. Are we simply seeing the fungus-induced visions of a struggling family, or something more visceral? We see Caleb being tempted to gaze at his sister's chest as her shift dips low is his temptation into the beautiful witch's cabin genuine, or simply a deeper metaphor for being drawn into evil? And Thomasin's final departure, her willingness to ""live deliciously"" does she actually float above the fire with the other witches, or is she simply choosing a life less rigid? We'll never know, and THAT is freaking brilliant."
" Moody, unsettling
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,7,"Good, slowly paced movie without any jump scares or explosions. Well acted, good set design, spooky (more like 'bleak') atmosphere- I really felt like I was in 1600s New England. The tension builds at a realistic pace. May be plodding for some. I was really worried it would become silly if Black Philip spoke, but it turned out OK. The witches were unsettling and I could really feel the family's anguish. Not sure I understand what happened with the twins."
" Probably one of the worst movies i've ever seen...
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,1,"I don't have much to say... it's slow, annoying, god fanatic crap, it's a wonderful piece of s***! Do not waste your time with that awful film unless you want to sleep or be bored as hell. 6.8 on IMDb is an absolute shame! 1/10 because i can't give a zero! I need 5 lines but i have absolutely nothing else to say!"
" initially interesting film that is hungry for cheese, and sticks of it
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,5,"Perhaps the idea of a witch in the woods preying on a humble Christian family living at its edge was just too strait for writer / director Robert Eggars.I liked the set up and the first half. We are presented with a small handful of intelligent and sympathetic characters and there is a clear sense of where (but not what) the threat is. Then just past the half way mark, the scenes get progressively silly and derivative of better horror movies. You feel the irony of a witchcraft movie that has been possessed and lost its soul and direction.The decision to use strong period dialect is simultaneously frustrating and intriguing. It commands the audience to be intelligent listeners but there are times when sentences get muddled underneath the heavy British accents. The theme of fearing abandonment by god (or possession by darkness,) is prevalent as the story gets underway. At first it feels like a historically accurate motive for character vulnerability, but instead it becomes a device for hokey paranoia as our characters start pointing fingers and accusing each other of witchcraft. The dramatic momentum that slowly accumulates in the first hour comes undone in the last half hour. The Witch starts as a story about characters but regretfully caves in and conforms to the horror genre by summoning gimmicks like the possessed animal that turns on its master. Once the chaos starts to pick up you get the feeling that a lame ending is inevitable. The last scene of a movie is visually quite strong without being showy, but the punchline feels meaningless beyond saying that darkness prevails; again very generic for a horror film.Strong acting and eerie scenery are the additional highlights, but the finished product is neither scary nor memorable."
" I didn't know you can put that much rubbish in one movie!!
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,1,"The is the worst movie I've ever watched in my entire life. There are terrible movies, but this one? it is in a whole new level of bad.The movie is so darn slow that it makes you wanna fast forward, or maybe keep it on fast forward. The director likes to put a camera in a place and not move it for like 10 minutes, I don't know if you call that directing. A dark screen that lasts for literally one minute. A dark screen can be used to separate two scenes but why keep it for a minute? because there is not story in here, it's just stalling. The ending is so disappointing and boring at the same time. When the credits started running I said ""What? is that it?"" It's just a waste of time."
" Boring movie. but I give 10 for the acting and 5 for the rest.
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,5,"I'll open my review by saying that I suspect that majority of the reviews here are fake means: they are ordered by the studio staff/owners, which is easy to do that today, all social medias, and those could be also friends and family members, you know, it happens all the time. now back to the main thing, the review: I will start by the positive because it's easier, shorter and it's better that I be calm when I write this while I already warmed myself above, but now am a bit relaxed because I said what makes me feel good, what I liked in this movie is the acting only, the actors were really very professional, both the adults and the little kids, all did their job in professional way and convincing, that's it. the sound-FX's were also fine, the the choirs are nice but a little bit over-used, it would be nice if there was a variety of choirs, not the same thing the whole movie because this produces boredom that I will talk about soon in this review. the accent was very heavy , but I think that it's relevant for the kind of this movie (it's origin/folklore) so I can't complain a lot, or I can complain but, I'll not blame the producers for that, it's simply me who can't handle 90 minutes such an accent, so be aware of that, it might let you feel heavy and tired. for sure they couldn't use accent of new-age Hollywood movies because then it wouldn't make sense for a movie that was done in England (or related to England) , so again, that was done because of production/story need , but today many people will complain for that , including those who wrote the fake positive reviews. so, now back to the boring issue. the movie has no characters except of the same family members, but with focus on the father (he talks a lot and very heavy, including his voice, low-notes and noisy) as someone who is a heavy-smoker (if you know what I mean), the general vibe of the movie isn't horror, but rather, a family that struggles to find a way to provide food for itself, so the father and kids try to hunt for food, later on the kids are dead at the farm (you don't see how) except of one of them, the elder sister, which is suspected to be a witch , her parents later die too, the father is hit by his goat, and the girl kills her mother when her mother tried to hit her so as self defense she used a knife, and that's it , that's all the movie, no serious horror that makes feel insane suspense. there are only few scenes of suspense when the father and his kids go to hunting in the forest, but only 2-3 scenes, nothing serious. it's not a classic Hollywood horror, but a normal folklore movie from UK.I rate it 5 , 10 for actors, 5 for rest."

" 5 minutes
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,4,"The director managed to pack 5 minutes of movie into 90. Talk about slow pacing that does not serve a purpose, atmospheric or otherwise. Boring. Slow paced. Not creepy. Dull. Lifeless.. Blah.. Blech."
" Slow and Atmospheric in the Best Way
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,9,"The Witch is a superb example of horror derived from atmosphere and characterization, rather than the jump scares typical of lower-quality horror movies. The unique setting of early colonial America lends itself perfectly to the slow, tense pace of the film. Although the plot is fairly straightforward, it reveals itself with a feeling of inescapable dread. Excellent acting abounds, particularly from the father (Ralph Eneson) and the eldest child (Anya Taylor-Joy).Overall, The Witch represents one of the best horror films in recent memory. If you enjoy slow/atmospheric/psychological horror, this is a must-see. If you are looking for an action/thriller/jump-scare horror, look elsewhere."
" Incredibly stupid
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,1,"Another stupid movie with the catching title The Witch, written and directed by a man who obviously has absolutely no idea who witches were or what they origins were. Shame really to confirm the stereotype in 2015 when there is a move to demystify witches and recognise them for they really were/are - Wise Women!"

Regarding the acting Peter, the black goat, was probably the best of them all:|. Don't waste you're time!!!"
" Not scary, just awkward
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,3,"The only reason i gave this film that 3 out of 10 was because the technical effects and actual acting were pretty good, anything outside of that was complete rubbish.

Gross and generally ""uncomfortable""? yes, but terrifying? Not at all"
" Don't waste your time!

I was intrigued from the previews but left thinking it's something that deserves to be skewered by MST3K or Rifftrax. From the previews it looked scary, but nope, NOT scary at all, but dull and BORING! Dialogue hard to understand and the ending sucked. I don't see why this got good reviews. Don't waste your time on this film. You are better off watching paint dry!"
" The Movie That Made Me Terrified of Goats: The Witch
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,7,"I am a grown ass man who likes his steaks rare, whiskey straight, and gets beat up for fun. And this movie made me sleep with the lights on. Straight up I turned the lights off, laid down on the couch and almost immediately turned them back on. This movie made me feel like a little kid alone in the grocery store, at night, surrounded by werewolves. I will never look at a goat the same way ever again, and I will never, ever play peek-a-boo again. This is horror at its creepiest and best, but it is not for everyone. This movie is slow with few jump scares, and the dialogue is an old English that is hard to understand so you might want the subtitles on. If you can get by those bumps, then buckle yourself down for one hell of a creepy ride.The movie is about a colonial family somewhere in New England in the 1630s. The family is exiled from the settlement for the fathers religious views, forcing them to move out into the wilderness on their own. They are able to set up a farm a few days ride from the settlement, and things seem to be going OK, but there is something horribly wrong with the farm, and the family. A missing child, a make shift exorcism, and many, many pull-out-your-hair tense scenes later and you reach the end of the marathon of scares. And holy sh*t I never want to be alone in the dark again. The ending is deeply horrifying and is a great pay off to the slowly building tension that has been ever-present throughout the entire movie.The star is the lead actress, who is on the rise after starring in this and in M. Night Shamalamadingdong's excellent Split. She plays the eldest child, at 14-16 years old. This will cause serious issues with you over 18-year-old guys because she is absolutely gorgeous, but do not worry. She was 18 during production so your only a little creepy, but you know not pedophile creepy. She carries the movie as she is target of the paranoia and superstition that takes over the family. However, maybe the best scene is a make shift exorcism scene. Without spoiling much, the family thinks one of the kids is obsessed; and my god the kid gives Linda Blair a run for her money for best exorcism. It is brutal and made me uncomfortable and scarred in all the right ways.This movie perfectly captures abject terror and the uncanny feeling that makes even the simplest shot of a forest scary. Within minutes you'll be uncomfortable and feel a chill go down your spine. And you will have no idea why. This movie scares you to the core without loud noises, cheap tricks, or overly gory violence. If you do not mind a slow burn, and like to feel your horror deep inside and not just a loud jump then I cannot recommend this movie enough. Just check out the trailer, and if that doesn't scare you then you are more man than I am."
" I be the witch of the wood...
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,7,"With language based on authentic early 17th century usage and a plot drawn from tales of that time it seems an unlikely film. It's fair to say that some of the dialogue does feel a little forced olde- worlde but that is forgivable. All the cast acted their Puritan smocks off: The youngest children, apparently carefree, exude a menace that only the seemingly innocent can do - there are few things as sinister as children's laughter. The older children are transitioning to early adulthood with pressures and stresses on them (far in excess of today's sheltered teens) contributing to the family's descent. The parents, Anya Taylor-Joy slightly hammy as the disturbed and grieving mother practically swept aside by Ralph (Finchy!!) Ineson's dominance as the father who has sinned - you get the feeling he was taking this VERY seriously. The scenery and lighting are relentlessly bleak and amplify the isolation the family must feel when they (and their livestock...) are expelled from their religious community - a family as dependent on prayers to meet their needs as they are the backbreaking toil they endure every day. The unsettling feeling that something is not quite right grows in the viewer inline with the increasing paranoia, tension and fever induced surrealism within the family. In hindsight the final denouement feels like a false memory or a drug induced hallucination, did that really happen? A 'horror' film that will remain with you on dark autumn days."
" Horrible audio
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,1,"Between the huge swings in dialog volume, poor recording quality (either sibilant or muffled), and the actors trying too hard to say their lines in a thick accent making them often unintelligible, I couldn't get past 10 minutes of this movie. What a shame. Might have been a good movie - I'll never know."
" Something Evil in the Woods...
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"The Witch, or the VVitch, as it is so cleverly marketed, is one of the finest examples of supernatural horror I've seen in a film for quite some time, and considering the current trend of jump-scare laden cheese-fests, that's definitely saying something. Even more shocking than the film itself perhaps is the fact that this is the directorial debut of writer/director Robert Eggers, a New England native who skillfully drew from his childhood surroundings of isolated colonial farmhouses and lonely cemeteries in the middle of the woods as inspiration for this film. Cold, haunting, dreary, and sinister are all words which come to mind when describing the look and atmosphere of this finely-crafted work of art. From start to finish a creeping sense of primeval dread and suspense embodies every scene in one way or another. Taking place in 17th century New England, the film focuses on a Puritan family, father William (Ralph Ineson), mother Katherine (Kate Dickie), teenage daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), adolescent son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas (Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson), as they are banished from their colonial settlement due to being too severe in their interpretation of the scriptures even by Puritan standards. They travel into a deeply wooded, isolated region where they settle down, build a farmhouse, and try to start anew, with a newborn son, Samuel, soon arriving and bringing a tinge of joy to an otherwise dour household. However, other, unknown forces of evil are congregating just beyond the confines of their land, and it isn't long before they begin seeping into the lives of the family itself. The land itself is not very fertile and soon the crops begin to fail, and the animals, especially a goat innocuously named Black Phillip, begin acting strange and unnatural. Then things take a turn for the worse when the infant son Samuel, who was yet unbaptized, is abducted under mysterious circumstances. Teenage daughter Thomasin, who was supposed to be looking after him when he disappeared, immediately falls under suspicion from the family and that's when things begin to get truly terrifying, for both the audience and the unfortunate family being tormented by some unseen evil lurking in the woods. The Witch is not your standard horror film, as while it does have horror elements, parts of it also play out like a period drama a la The Crucible, a film which is often compared to this due to the similar settings/characters. However, while The Crucible is more about the dangers of mass hysteria and religious fanaticism, as opposed to witchcraft and sorcery, The Witch makes it far more clear that it's not simply paranoia slowly tearing the family apart, but something very real and very dangerous. The film moves at a rather slow pace, and doesn't feature any jump scares or any of the usual clichés found in horror movies nowadays, which is actually very refreshing. In addition to that the soundtrack and cinematography perfectly compliment the film and add an extra dimension to the horrific plot as it slowly unfolds. As the family situation continually spirals downward into madness and chaos, and the family turns against one another out of fear and suspicion, the supernatural horrors of the surrounding forest become more and more evident, less subtle, and more terrifying, with a truly unexpected and shocking conclusion that I feel most viewers will not be able to predict, due to the very unpredictable nature of the film itself. In addition to the human characters, the animals and even the forest itself function as developed characters in their own right, perfectly complimenting the overall plot/story. Overall I highly recommend this film for viewers who are looking for something different than standard modern-day horror fare, with a style that is more reminiscent of old-fashioned classics like The Innocents or The Haunting, with a dread-filled atmosphere, and slowly ratcheting suspense over explicit violence and gore. You won't be disappointed, Robert Eggers is a truly a force to be reckoned with."
" Don't waste your time with this
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,1,"One of the ugliest movies I've ever seen. In the end it felt like an assault on Christianity by yet another Atheistic Hollywood Radical. Depressing all the way through, absolutely void of the proverbial 'light at the end of the tunnel',hard to understand what was being said at many points in the movie as well but that is not so uncommon in recent years. By the way, what parent would allow their 5 year old children to partake of this acting gig? Sadly, they were great little actors as they did come across as being possessed by the devil. While I am offering faint praise, I'll also add that it was a respectable effort in conjuring up the way these colonials might have actually spoke back then. However, the content of what was spoken was hideous 90% of the time, spitting at the bible and making a mockery of it throughout. I am not an ""out there"" bible thumping whacko but this film still managed to offend. Bottom line look elsewhere for a horror movie. This one will leave you empty and exasperated with the feeling of being punched in the stomach."
" Flawless
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,10,"Objectively speaking it's the best horror film of the last 20 or so years. The setting and atmosphere is immensely grim and dour, it makes the film insanely tense, though it's not the most exciting horror of the year, it really crawled under my skin and I can't stop thinking about the ending ever since I saw it. The performances are flawless."
" Dull movie. Visually and dramatically dull. Spectacularly dull..
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,2,"After reading reviews here I was looking for forward to this film. I was disappointed. I like a film with strong visuals, tensions, shocks and drama. This has none of those. It appears to have been filmed through a grey/sepia filter. Suspense is weakened by early scenes which make sure you're not left wondering whether or not there are malign forces at work. The acting is patchy: the main male lead is Way Over The Top imo, just does ""rage"" throughout without much subtlety. Apparently the dialogue is based on historical records. It may be, but it doesn't make good drama. If you want a history lesson, read a book. It didn't work for me.Dull movie."
" Thy movie suffers as thine ending sucketh..
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,6,"First things first. Without doubt, one of THE best opening scenes introducing the ""big bad"" (the Witch) and setting the tone for a horror movie. Hell, the movie is worth seeing just for the introduction the Witch gets.Now comes the part where the movie messes it up. It takes way too long showing an uninteresting puritan family's daily banter, which you most likely will have trouble understanding because thy speech is olde and rotten.Which means that you have to listen to them pray every time somebody drops the spoon or thinks they sinned or something (which is pretty much all the time). It added to the charm at first, but after half an hour, it got old and annoying.But the movie has another trick up its sleeves. The forest. That's right, the movie starts with the foreboding forest as the backdrop for the puritan family and presents it as a dark entity where only evil lives (why anyone would want to build a home next to it is a mystery, I sure wouldn't, I've seen Blair Witch :P). The scenes which are shot inside the forest are really well done with creepiness meter definitely on the edge constantly.Now comes the part where movie decides to ruin it all, again, but showing the typical moronic ending the movies with witches have. Manages to kill any suspense anything the viewer might have imagined, by showing a generic portrayal of witches. I know they were trying to be authentic to the beliefs of the people at the time, but they REALLY could've used something original and creepy. I am trying to avoid mentioning anything that would give the ending away, that's why this para is vague.I took of two points just cause of the last 10-15 mins which basically ruins any suspense or hope you had built up till then.BUT, is it a must watch movie? I didn't get scared, I only find psychological horror (Blair Witch) scary and this movie is not a psychological horror movie. In-fact, it shows you the monster in the beginning and avoids jump scares (there are only few and they are toned down as well) religiously. What this movie does well is the creepy atmosphere, which I haven't seen done since I saw Blair Witch as a kid one sunny afternoon.So yes, it's a movie you should definitely watch, despite my 6/10 rating. It would've been 8/10 with a better ending mimicking Blair Witch tone. Oh well."
" Do not watch this movie with children younger than 13.
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,10,"A very frightful and graphic representation of Pilgrims' lives in New England during the 17th century, more so since it was the Pilgrims themselves that brought the art of Witchcraft from Great Britain and continued practicing it in the New World. Although the scene of the baby being mashed by the witch was a really unnecessary addition to the movie, the movie overall still deserves 10 stars for its truthfulness and superb actors."
" Terrifying! (in the good way)
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,9,"The things with horror movies genre is you almost always know they are all about the same and utterly there's nothing new and remarkable to appreciate.But that is not the case with this one. The Witch has a beautiful production that involves excellent camera work, photograph, sound score, even costumes. All it makes it very real and credible and works out splendid.Certainly the actors were perfectly castled in their roles, i really liked the parents and for me the to elder brothers, Harvey Scrimshaw (Caleb) and Anya Taylor-Joy (Thomasin) stole the movie. I can see a great future in the industry for this two.The script it is quite alright, nothing out of site and very direct to the audience.Finally, i was very surprised with the end of the story, shocking and totally outstanding utter than scary. Because i don't think is a scary movie, but it does have his terrifying moments, when you can feel a little unsettling. And i thinks that's the reason the film work so well.If you like real good movies with something more than monsters and crappy effects, you will enjoy this one for sure."
" THE WITCH is One of the Best Horror Films in Recent Years
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,9,"I love THE WITCH. The film is a period horror film from writer/director Robert Eggers, a man I'd never heard of but whose work I will be looking out for in the future. THE WITCH is haunting, methodical, suspenseful, and obsessed with detail. Listening to Eggers' commentary for the film, it's obvious the man has a fascination with early American life and their supernatural superstitions. It's no surprise. THE WITCH must've been a passion project brewing in his mind for a good while because he put every ounce of attention into it. It's the tale of a Puritan family in 1630's Massachusetts who are exiled from their community for the father's overbearing religious preachings that don't quite mesh with their own local beliefs. And so William (Ralph Ineson) and his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie) pack up their children and move out into the woods to start their own little farmstead. Flash forward to sometime later, the family has settled in and built a home, started a little farm, and have welcomed their fifth child. One afternoon, the infant Samuel disappears right out from under the nose of eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy). At the same time, the family crops are mysteriously dying and their animals aren't providing. The winter is approaching, their food is scarce, their youngest child is missing and presumed dead, and strange happenings lead to hushed accusations of witchcraft; there is something evil beyond the tree line and they start to fear a dark presence amongst them.With little exception, everything in this movie works 100%. It really is one of the strongest horror films I've seen in years. I love that it doesn't have to rely on jump scares and gratuitous violence or gore. Don't get me wrong, it has those but it doesn't rely on them. When Samuel disappears mid-peek-a-boo, it's just as jarring as any jump scare and, while the family is ignorant of poor Samuel's ultimate fate, we the audience are privy to it and it'll make your skin crawl. Instead of slapping you across the face with horror clichés, THE WITCH builds a tension over the course of the movie. It starts with Samuel's disappearance. Then we see the family begin to buckle under the pressure. Poor Katherine is losing her mind in grief and the two youngest children, Jonas and Mercy, become increasingly more insufferable, teasing Thomasin that Black Peter (the family's black ram) speaks to them of her wickedness. Thomasin becomes a target for Katherine's angst and poor William, who hasn't had the greatest luck since moving his family to the middle of the woods to start a new life, is doing everything in his power to keep the peace. THE WITCH is just as much a psychological thriller as it is a traditional horror. These people are isolated from the rest of society and super religious; the idea that someone in their little family might be in league with Satan is something they're actually willing to consider. It's unnerving.Of course, this is a horror film and the movie establishes that it isn't just paranoia from the very beginning. We, the audience, know of the witch in the woods. What we don't know is whether anyone in the family might be working in conjunction with it. Are the children telling the truth about whisperings from Black Peter? Or are the accusations lobbied against Thomasin based on truth? The very idea that one of the children might've dabbled in the dark arts is enough to tear the family apart in fear and suspicion. It's absolutely enthralling to watch. While everyone in this film delivers standout performances (well, except maybe Harvey Scrimshaw as middle child Caleb some of his stuff didn't sit right with me), the real accolades belong to Ralph Ineson and Anya Taylor-Joy. Ineson was perfectly cast in the role as the devout Puritan and loving father to the struggling family and elicits the most sympathy as a man just trying to keep it all together, but Taylor-Joy just knocks it out as Thomasin. From the start, she's a tormented girl. She seems absolutely miserable at the news that her family's been exiled and, despite trying her best to do her part, she keeps coming under fire from her grieving mother. There's no hesitation from her mother in blaming her when something goes wrong and the youngest children are just a royal pain. Her performance walks a line where you aren't sure if she's just good at bottling up her issues in the face of her family or if she's got something going on the side, like maybe some demonic-aided retribution against her tormentors.And I haven't even raved about how much I love the production and costume design. Eggers really went for full immersion, with period-accurate dialogue and everything. He admits to taking a few creative licenses with some aspects to better suit the story but THE WITCH, with all the talent involved in front of and behind the camera, is one of the most authentic-feeling period pieces I've seen. This all adds immeasurably to the well-written story and amazing character performances. THE WITCH won't satisfy all horror fans, and the pacing may bore some others, but it's an enthusiastic recommend from me."
" Better than critics claim!
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie! I am a horror movie fanatic and one of the biggest fans of the genre. I was very skeptical of going to see this due to the poor ratings on rottentomatoe but I enjoyed it! It was a movie about a family who leaves civilization in 1630 and experience the devil and witches. It isn't zombies or a disease, it's something people feel like was real! It's based off old English true stories so it also gives the illusion of being true. I admit it is hard to comprehend the language but old English is hard for anyone... Go see it on DVD :)"
" If it weren't for the offensive content, this might have been one of the best films of the year
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,1,"The creepy atmosphere was first rate and the performance by Anya Taylor Joy was outstanding, but unfortunately the script was utterly tasteless. There was certainly a mass hysteria promoted by Christian fanaticism in the colonial period and many innocent people were murdered because of it. I'm sickened by the direction that this film takes because rather than creating a horror film that explores how twisted and demented people of the time were and then gruesomely illustrating their terminal descent into madness, the film actually gives credence to their fanaticism by making their fears into reality. And to make the point, I'm not against supernatural elements in storytelling, in fact it's one of my favorite themes, but depicting women, animals and forests as wicked and depraved things to be scared of is completely unacceptable."
" Brave, ambitious horror film-making, which may be lost to some
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,9,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning 1630, rural England. A devout Christian family find themselves banished by the elders of their local community, on account of their father William's (Ralph Ineson) puritanical, uncompromising religious ways, into the wilderness. They set up a home in the forest, and live their lives strictly in accordance with the teachings of the Bible. But then, a mysterious curse seems to befall them, where their crops fail and the infant child of the family disappears into thin air. The family find their dynamics closing in on each other, with accusations flying around, culminating in daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) being accused of practising witchcraft.Of all the genres, in recent times, horror is probably a strong contender for the one that's become the most stale and stagnant, a field that's become over loaded with remakes or original work that's highly derivative of other works that's gone before, and it's all become pretty samey and interchangeable. And so it's refreshing, at least, that feature length debut director Robert Eggers has delivered something like The Witch, a period horror piece that takes us back to the times of Ye Olde England, and drowns us in dialogue that recreates to a tee the spoken dialect of the time, a move that will wrap up and captivate many, and will sadly make it impenetrable for just as many others.If the dialogue and text is something the average viewer might struggle to get their head around, one thing that will manage to appeal to horror aficionados of all ranges is the beautiful, perfectly creepy and unsettling sense of atmosphere, with the dense, barren forest and the thick, glimmering mist used to beautifully haunting, spooky effect, complimented by a soundtrack that jeeps and jars at just the right times for maximum effect. In the lead role, Ineson's gravelly Yorkshire drawl lends his spoken dialogue an added air of vitality. The climax sacrifices solving the mystery of the missing child for something more startling and ambiguous.In an age where the average horror flick seems to think frequent jump scares, excessive gore, young teen stars with questionable acting skills being chased and a whiny grunge soundtrack playing over the end credits is enough, it's certainly a breath of fresh air for something like The Witch to come along, and receive a lot of the acclaim it has. And deservedly so, if only so much of the historical recreation wouldn't have proved so overwhelming to so many. ****"
" A chilling slow burner of a tale.
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,8,"This film is not an easy watch, and is complex. The viewers can debate all day what was going on, but it is a genuine horror film, all because the director takes you back to the 17th century, a time where religious beliefs, were the glue that held families together. As the film unfolds the viewer sees what tricks the mind can play on the people living together in the wilderness, as things don't go as planned. This work is far more thought provoking, and chilling than so many so called horror films made for today's younger audiences. Ambitious and creative horror film makers and students should see this film, study it, and see what can be done with a limited budget and less well known actors."
" The Folktale Aspect Is Key Here
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,10,"While being touted as a ""horror flick"", ""The Witch"" only shares that designation in the sense that the events depicted within it can be quite unsettling. It is nowhere near, however, the type of movie that most theater-goers these days would consider ""horror"". It has nothing in common with, say, ""Paranormal Activity"", which uses jump-scares to produce its frights. No, ""The Witch"" is a much more subtle type of scary, the type that unspools with each minute as you begin to gain a deeper understanding of how troubling the situation is becoming.For a very basic overview, ""The Witch"" tells the story of a family in 1630s New England. Father William (Ralph Ineson) has a major falling-out with the religious community in his village, forcing him to be excommunicated and banished to the wilderness lands where he must begin a new life with wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), teenage daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), well-meaning son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), and two young twins Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson). There is also an infant boy in tow, who quickly disappears near the edge of the forest. The family suspects witchcraft, but is there really paranormal activity afoot? Also, suspicions are raised that perhaps Thomasin herself knows more than she is letting on.On of the biggest keys to keep in mind while watching this movie is that director Robert Eggers makes no bones about the the fact that the story is essentially an amalgamation of real-life accounts from the time period, an era when people believed far different things than what we generally do now when it comes to things like religion and the paranormal. So even if certain on-screen events seem absurd, far-fetched, or don't 100% always make sense, remember that they are all basically drawn straight from the mouths of real people.There are many deep and interesting themes in ""The Witch"":One big one is the role religion plays in the life of the family. Despite (or perhaps because of?) their devout Christianity, the mother and father are quick to contemplate witchcraft and relate it to a supposed lack of piety.Another interesting theme centers on familial relationships. The mother and father are constantly at odds about how to live their lives, especially with Thomasin just coming into her womanhood and brother Caleb's not-so-subtle noticing of that very fact. Even the little twins, who seem innocent, manage to rile up a family goat (named ""Black Phillip"") and are quick to point fingers (as children are wont to do) at a sibling's transgressions. It's a potent family mix that only becomes more combustible when the overriding religious concepts are thrown into the fray.Pacing-wise, ""The Witch"" uses a simmering or building of tension almost like a Hitchcock flick, where the suspense is given more screen time than the ""big reveal"". Whereas horror fans are used to being jump-scared out of their seats, ""The Witch"" again and again takes you just to the point of terror and then backs off.The ending of the film--which I won't spoil here--is going to rub some people the wrong way. Again, however, please remember how it was constructed from actual journals, writings, and other documents of New Englanders from that time period. It tries to be as authentic as possible in that vein, which obviously makes it difficult to construct a narrative around which contemporary audiences will appreciate. Eggers does the best he can, but the ending simply requires as much obliqueness as finality.Overall, I think that two words--""reflection"" & ""thought""--really are the key to appreciating ""The Witch"". If you are expecting a movie where every few minutes the tension builds and something jumps out, you might be disappointed. Instead, the real horror of ""The Witch"" probably comes as much after the viewing process and you begin to process what you just saw. The combination of fanatical religion, 1600s family dynamics, and the supernatural elements will give you plenty to think about for days afterward."
" Convincing tale of Puritan family's paranoia leading to murder ruined by reliance on typical horror film tropes
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,4,"The Witch marks the directorial debut of Roger Eggers, who meticulously researched this tale of a 17th century Puritan family banished from their community due to a disagreement over the interpretation of the New Testament. The characters and dialogue are based on actual court transcripts from the time period as well as folk tales that reflect the supernatural beliefs of the people of that era.The attention to period detail is perhaps the film's greatest strength as well as its greatest weakness. Eggers' protagonists--consisting of parents William and wife Katherine, son Caleb, and fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas, as well as their daughter, Thomasin (who emerges as the story's antagonist)--feel as though they were delivered directly to the screen via a time machine. The verisimilitude of the characters is that convincing. At the same time, because they speak in the arcane style of old English, dependent on the Bible, you might find it quite difficult understanding the words that are being uttered—unless English subtitles are available on your DVD.The story begins with the family living in a remote, rural area. Thomasin is babysitting Katherine's newborn son, Samuel, who is kidnapped—and we soon learn that a witch snatched Samuel and killed him for his blood (to make a flying ointment). When William takes Caleb hunting, he confesses that he sold Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. Later, when Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of the cup, she implies that not only did she steal the cup but also had something to do with Samuel's disappearance. Meanwhile, the other children claim that the family goat, Black Phillip, has been talking to them.When Caleb decides to go hunting in the forest by himself, Thomasin insists on joining him. Eventually William finds Thomasin but Caleb ends up in the clutches of a witch and when he finally returns to the home, he's dying of a fatal illness. After the young boy's death, the twins and Thomasin accuse one another of being in league with witches and William is forced to lock them all up in the goat's stable.What could have been a nice little story of a 17th century family's paranoia leading to murder, is replaced by a silly folktale about witches being responsible for the carnage that unfolds before us. The sequence of events is as follows: the twins disappear, William finds Thomasin unconscious in the stable with blood on her hands, Black Phillip kills William, Katherine blames Thomasin for William's death and attempts to strangle her, and Thomasin kills her mother in self-defense. Eggers appears to buy the superstitious mumble-jumble of those times when he has Thomasin end up in the forest talking to Black Phillip the goat, who of course is actually Satan. When she signs Satan's ""big book,"" it's the old trope of signing away one's soul to the devil.Alan Scherstuhl, writing in the Village Voice, couldn't have said it better: ""The Witch purports, at times, to confront ignorance and hysteria, but in the end, for horror thrills, Eggers's film sides with the preachers and executioners."" In other words, despite all the impressive research, The Witch is just another dumb horror movie. Despite the earnest performances (especially an intense Anya Taylor-Joy playing the accused Thomasin), once we're force fed all this nonsense about witches and a goat morphing into Satan, all bets are unfortunately off."
" gets very compelling
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"It's 17th century New England. Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) lives with her family on an isolated farm. The local village banishes them for religious disagreements. Her parents are strict and God fearing. Her younger brother Caleb has lustful thoughts about her. Her younger twin siblings Mercy and Jonas are obsessed with the family black goat Black Phillip. Thomasin is playing with baby Samuel when he suddenly disappears. A witch in the woods has kidnapped and killed him. The farm is failing and the father is forced to hunt. Thomasin jokes by scaring Mercy about being a witch which comes back to haunt her. Caleb goes into the woods to gather food. Thomasin insists on joining him but it goes badly. Thomasin falls off the horse and Caleb is found in a sickly state.The movie gets really interesting around the midpoint. The first half feels slow and muddled. I had to watch the first half again to get a hold of the entire story. It's a matter of clarity and flow. After Samuel disappears, the family should be out of their minds searching the woods. Instead, the movie skips ahead a few day to them in a depressed state surrendered to the baby's fate. It's missing the emotional and plot connective tissues. The second half is much more intense paying off some story aspects. The lead girl Anya Taylor-Joy is terrific. The brother and the father are also great. This is an intriguing psychological horror."
" Not at all what was expected.
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,7,"This is more of a historical psychological thriller than a Hollywood blood and guts horror film.The film is a loving and accurate recreation of Puritan New England in the 1600s with everything from the language to the sets being authentic to the period. That in and of itself makes it fascinating to watch. Having lived in Virginia, where the Jamestown Settlement and the 1600s sometimes can seem like they happened the day before yesterday, I especially enjoyed the film. The location, in Ontario, reminded me of rural Virginia in winter, which made me quite homesick. So the film might have affected me more than some other audience members.The Witch is a fascinating glimpse into Christianity as practiced by 17th century Puritans. Satan and Evil are almost tangible presences in the woods and wilderness of the New World, while God is a distant, cold, and demanding being who must be constantly begged for forgiveness and mercy, since all human thoughts, words, and deeds seem to be gravely sinful and offensive to his eyes. A family of seven (parents, four children, and an infant) are exiled from their plantation community for not adhering to the accepted interpretation of scripture. They build a farm at a distance from the plantation near a frightening wood. The farm is failing (the family won't have food to last the winter). Meanwhile, the infant has been snatched from the oldest daughter while in her care at the edge of the wood. From this point on the family either descends into madness or is destroyed by Satan in the form of a witch who lives nearby in the woods. How the family's disintegration is interpreted will depend on which century's point of view you choose to use."
" Unsetteling
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,7,"The less you know about this film before you watch it, the better. The themes could find no better setting than the 17th century New England recluse scenery where this mythos has the precise place to exist and expand on its own.First time writer/director Robert Eggers is given (almost) full liberty to embrace and elaborate on the weird and the hypnotic, creating an ever-growing and unsettling atmosphere of fear and discomfort. The film hearkens back to those classical psychological frightening horror movies of old, such as Rosemary's Baby or The Haunting where more is made out of less: suggestion is key, actual display is minimal (but ever present and upcoming). When the time comes, the unsettlement is so severe that the Gothic-demented folkloric horror shown grabs hold of whatever composure is left. The Witch is a superior film, masterfully shot and executed, not designed for repeated viewings but intended for a lasting imprint of fear and homage to the mythology it is inspired by."
" Quintessential 21st Century Horror
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,10,"The Witch (VVitch) is one goddamned scary movie, and it's not because of cheap thrills and jump-cuts galore. This is a movie that buries itself deep into your psyche, slowly builds up as a monster movie as well as something along the lines of a psychological thriller. In an era when it seems like horror has little more to contribute, here comes a movie that packs a punch comparable to great modern films like The Babadook.It's an undated time when America is barely colonized. A small family is banished from the city for religious betrayal or some such thing. It's hard to know for sure especially as the opening shot is of the magistrates of the town sentencing the family to leave at once. We see the reactions of the father's children. They are young, confused, willing to follow their parents and yet unsure of what the implications are. With little more than a wagon loaded, the family departs and sets up a small farm on the edge of a dark forest. Al is well.If you have seen the trailer, you know the general feel of the film. What surprised me was how quickly the film jumped into the thick of the terror, as the infant baby is kidnapped before their oldest daughter's eyes. Perhaps it was a wolf, and through frantic searches, they give up hope as the baby is known to be dead by either animals or hunger. The next- youngest, a set of twins who playfully run throughout the farm, claim to know stories of 'the witch of the wood.' It's laughed off.When I recall to mind great horror movies, I think of moments that catch you off guard, where you as an audience member are generally frightened for what is about to happen. These movies follow no clichéd plot lines nor are they predictable by any means. In The Witch, I was led on a journey that was so terrifying if only because the audience knows something that the family does not: there is a witch, indeed.Our first introduction to her is a scene so disturbing and eerie that my mouth hung open the entire scene. It's not long after the baby goes missing. There are a few shots as we see the witch mostly in shadows, as she goes about business that takes fear to a new level. The imagery coupled with some extremely Kubrick-ian music (think 2001: A Space Odyssey), this becomes a film so drenched with tone and darkness that it draws your attention even in the quietest of scenes.I really don't want to say too much more about the story, except that the family grows to suspect the eldest daughter for a variety of coincidental reasons. Though we know there is a satanic force lurking in the trees, the majority of the films turns inward as we watch a family devoted to God unravel with suspicion and fear. It's a believable family, with the father a kind and compassionate man, his wife God-fearing and unhinged, and children that are raised to know little more than good versus evil and His Holy Word.Robert Eggers directed and wrote the film in an astonishing debut as a filmmaker. There is a confidence in his style that already feels like it comes from a master. The performances he draws out of his small cast (especially the children) are remarkable, and at times this feels like a movie that is already a classic in the horror genre. My sole concerns (and deductions in the rating) come from the film's ending, one that feels cheap and unneeded for a movie so layered with style. It's a film that uses no special effects until the very last moments, and even then, was it really necessary? The final moments also contain a reveal that shows the truth hidden throughout the entire film, and even then, perhaps a bit of ambiguity wouldn't have hurt.The Babadook. It Follows. The Witch. Year after year we have seen a select group of films that simply redefine psychological horror, and they are few and far between. The trailers beforehand included two or three movies billed as being scary yet appear to be little more than slasher films with buckets of gore and fake blood. When will filmmakers learn that it isn't blood that frightens an audience, it is the unknown. Do not miss this movie."
" Not a horror.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"This film has a lot going for it, excellent acting, some beautiful cinematography, this showed the vastness of the 17th century wilderness and the claustrophobic living conditions. I think films set in this time frame work better as it was a time when gods and devils seemed real to the uneducated people of the time. I did not find this a horror movie but did find it disturbing, some of claimed it is anti religious which it is to a degree showing the nonsense of inherited sin and the tosh of needing someone to redeem these sins. The film is based in 17th century America and the early Puritans, one family is forced out and sets up a house in the wilderness. I am not sure the film needed a demonic element but could have stood alone as a film showing religious hysteria prevalent at the time."
" A Masterpiece
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie a couple of times already and it still lingers in my head everyday. The tone and imagery of this film crawled inside me and nestled itself in my mind like no other had in a long time.The aspects of the film (lighting, sound, dialog, pacing, composition) created an atmosphere so real I was no longer sitting on my couch watching, but rather living this inherited puritan nightmare. This was the result of a director who not only painstakingly researched every aspect of colonial life in the 1630s, but who also executed his ideas with striking confidence.Calling this movie scary doesn't due justice to how truly powerful and intense the horror scenes feel. He doesn't hold back, shy away with the camera or use bullshit jump-scares to frighten you. Rather he composes scenes like an artist would a painting. In fact, I would almost say this film could be seen as a Fransisco Goya painting brought to life. He focuses in on the evil at hand, while still maintaining a sense of unknown and wonder. He is brilliant at what he shows you, but more in what he doesn't show.Films like these don't come around very often. There is true passion seen here by a very hungry, driven and intelligent director. I am truly impressed and hope he has a long and successful career."
" A Creepy, Moving, Gut Wrenching Thinker
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,10,"I just watched it, loved it and am watching it again immediately. Excuse the quick review but I hate typing on my tablet. Overall I simply loved it. The movie has/is creepiness, acting, dialogue, period piece, supernatural, grimness, and emotion. You truly feel for the characters and wonder what is going on in their head. The Cinematography is incredible. Music, perfect. I just can't say enough to how well this thing delivered.Expect a slow burn with enough drama for a typical critic to get it and enough horror for a creepy movie fan like myself to enjoy themselves along the way.Highly recommended!"
" This is why Witches were Scary
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,8,"Modern films such as Kiki's Delivery Service or any film in the Harry Potter franchise take the idea of a witch and make them characters that the majority of people will like. Strong, intelligent, and they don't usually try to cause harm to others. This movie? It reminds/teaches us that witches can be freaking scary. This movie seriously feels like we're being told a story around a campfire in the best possible way. This must be what people during the Salem Witch Trials believed happened on a regular basis. It feels like a legend (or a legal account depending on where you are in history) being told to warn sinners about what could happen if you let the devil into your life. The movie even outright says it in its alternate title, The VVitch: A New England Folk-Tale. If you go into the movie with that kind of mindset, more of the elements will start to make sense. This movie would have been rated higher if I could just understand the entire script! I luckily was able to piece most of the story together through the dialogue I could understand (props to Anya Taylor-Joy and Kate Dickie) but the father and the son were very hard to understand through certain parts of the film. It's hard for me to be fully immersed if I have to go back in my head and think of what they could have possibly said.I hope more people see this film. Seeing the discrepancy between critics and audiences sadden me because this was really well-made. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, with diction being lost to historical accuracy (i think) and shots that lasted a little too long coming to mind, this movie deserves (most of) the credit it is given."
" ""The Witch"" is horror for cinephiles, not as much horror genre fans
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"There's another version of ""The Witch"" that could've existed. A Puritan family in New England gets terrified by a witch living in the woods, who torments them with supernatural Satanism. If you're saying to yourself, ""wait, isn't that exactly what this movie is?"" then you've come to the right review.I'm not what you'd call a fan of horror movies. I don't gravitate toward the genre and I almost never seek horror movies out in theaters. That said, any movie that garners critical acclaim or positive buzz piques my interest as a fan of cinema on the whole. ""The Witch"" lives in that territory as a horror movie for cinephiles, not for audiences who love the thrill of a good scare.That's not to say ""The Witch"" isn't scary; it is. It's just not scary in the modern trend-driven, formulaic, ""movie trailer that ends with a jump-scare"" kind of way. Writer and director Robert Eggers, who makes his feature film debut, builds his terror with tension drama and mystery, not by creating the pervasive sense that some creepy thing will pop into the frame at any moment.Eggers, a production designer first and foremost, builds his ""Puritan nightmare"" from the ground up, starting with all the tiniest era-appropriate details in the set, costumes and even dialogue. It doesn't take a historian to notice the immaculate craftsmanship and consideration of time and place. Eggers' devotion to this realism pays off in that the ""The Witch"" never loses its footing in reality even as more supernatural elements creep into the story. Well, until the end, but let's not go there except to say that by then, the realism matters much less.The story follows a Puritan family that leaves its plantation and village over religious differences and goes off to build a home near the edge of the woods. Suddenly, the family infant, Sam, disappears under the watch of the eldest child, Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy). The incident devastates the mother (Kate Dickie) and father (Ralph Ineson), who convince everyone it was a wolf that took Sam, but the tragedy trickles down to the four children, Thomasin, pre-teen Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) and young twins Jonas and Mercy. Of course, the audience is privy to what actually happened to Sam, and we know things will only get worse for the family.Considering the legitimate Puritan fear of Satan and witches, the subsequent events begin to tear into the family dynamics, which adds to the tension that already exists over what unnerving thing might happen next. The story could definitely have gone deeper into distrust and paranoia, but then it might have become too much of a ""witch trial"" movie.The way the movie ends will draw no shortage of opinions, but without a doubt, Eggers and cinematographer Jarin Blaschke have made an and utterly engrossing film that would be just as effective had it just been a period drama instead of a horror film – from a visual standpoint. Blaschke works almost exclusively with available natural light, which in addition to bolstering Eggers' emphasis on realism, keeps the specter of darkness and evil hanging over the family. In fact, had the film not marketed itself so overtly as a horror film, it might have been given more awards consideration. Regardless, Eggers delivers a remarkable feature debut that's a definite breakthrough candidate; he will certainly have a lot of eyes on his future projects. His focus on detail and strong cinematic instincts could work wonders on a more mainstream project, but if he opts for more small-budget genre films, no complaints here.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" Superbly executed, amazing production but not scary to me. But is to some.
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,7,"Production and costume designer Robert Eggers directs his first feature length debut about a family settling down in New England in the 1630s who experience something of the supernatural. Eggers previous movie roles really shines through as the whole production is on point, especially the sets and the costumes. The film is often dark, even during the daylight hours giving an enormous sense of bleakness throughout. Ralph Ineson leads his devout Christian family with his wife and five children, who struggle to keep the farmstead going and there's possibly something working against them other than the elements. Anya Taylor-Joy plays the eldest of the children and is usually shackled with the responsibility of tending to her younger siblings while father and boy go off to hunt. But they soon fall prey to the Witch who lives in the nearby woods, but not how you might expect. Ineson is amazing and truly deserves much larger roles than the ones he's played previously. Taylor-Joy already appears to getting noticed as quite the star with Morgan and soon to be released Split. But the whole cast here perform amazingly well, and the script is quite astonishing with impressive diction. Mark Korven does quite the eerie score which probably makes up for a lot of the atmosphere, it resonates right through you immersing the viewer deeper in the film and I strongly suggest not listening to it in isolation alone. Unfortunately with all these key elements, the story, the script, the haunting score and the production as a whole, it's not at all scary and is more of a drama than horror. It certainly has that feel of the classic horrors like the original Wicker Man, but it just didn't get to me like it maybe should have. Having said that, this film is definitely split into two camps. While some, like myself didn't get the full affect, others would find this frightful; even Stephen King, the master of horror himself has stated the film to be terrifying, so don't take my word for it not being scary. It's superbly executed, well performed and brilliantly written, but it's a personal shame I didn't take to it.

" Very atmospheric
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,7,"Everything about this film was creepy, from the surroundings to certain animals within the film. A must watch for true horror fans. I loved how the tension builds, it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.Some may say it's a slow burner but I did not find this to be the case at all. It was truly atmospheric and gave me genuine chills in some parts. The characters, even the small children, played their parts brilliantly and this certainly adds to the tension of the film. A few parts were a little hard to understand (accent wise) but this does not deter from the tension this film brings at all. Overall, anyone looking for a genuinely creepy film, who has an open mind and has the ability to think about things, then this film is for you"
" Validation for the Salem Witch Trials
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,2,"This movie is an absolute mess. It can't make up its mind whether it wants to vilify aimless accusations of witchcraft or to say that superstition is a good way to spend emotional energy and family dynamics. There are some creepy sexual implications involving barely adolescent teens, the characters are one minute good, the next minute evil, and ultimately, none of them are likable. I guess Eggers wanted to take a different approach, but he seems to change his approach with every scene. As a general rule, the more often twists occur, the less likely the audience is going to stay with you, and this film lost me within an hour."
" Chilling
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"All I can say is that this film does a brilliant job at giving you the creeps without going for cheap jump scares. And being someone who hates jump scares, that was refreshing. The Witch is about a Puritan family in the 1600s that is banished from their village, and then moves far away to a secluded area near a forest. In the forest, of course, resides a witch that kidnaps the family's youngest infant, and continuously messes around with the family throughout the movie. A lot of people say this film can be too slowly-paced at times, which I agree with. But I thought the slow-burn and subtlty worked really well. There were never any big moments with reveals, the way most horror/mysteries are. Little things would keep going wrong, and the suspense just kept building very slowly and painfully. But the ending definitely could've been played out a better...there were a few plot holes. If the goat was supposed to be the antagonist all along, what was the point of having the witch terrorize the family too? Also, who's responsible for kidnapping the twins, the witch or the goat? It was all too much to swallow at once, especially since the rest of the film was so much more subtle. And of course, Thomasin ends up killing her mother, and then joining the witch's side, which was a bit shocking but expected in a way. I guess she had no choice, since her whole family was dead. And the opening voice-over of her confessing her sins to God could've been an overshadowing of the ending--that she desired evil all along, as much as she tried to go against it. Another theory I have is that she (ironically) sacrificed herself to evil in order to pay for her family's death...since Thomasin told her mother ""I love you"" after killing her. These are just my ideas though; I have no idea what the director intended to say there. The cinematography, acting, dialogue, and score were solid. I'm amazed at how the actors were able to speak in character using such old dialogue, and I think it really contributed to how real the whole movie felt. A lot of people seem bothered by the filter, but I liked it. Imagining the movie with any more color makes me cringe...the filter fits the setting and mood perfectly enough. The score was subtle, like the film itself. It popped out when necessary and wasn't over dramatic. Almost nothing in this film was over-the-top except for the young kids' acting in some scenes. Overall I'd say this is a quality film that's definitely worth watching. It's a different kind of horror though, so know what to expect before you watch it."
" The village meets old witches..
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"The Witch also known as the vvitch is a horror film taking place in the 16th century about a family who move to a house outside a family and when there young baby vanishes without a trace,they find out the evil leaving in the woods that may lead to witchcraft. The film has a very very good storyline and it pretty much had no plot holes to me,there were not actually that many scary scenes which made you appreciate the plot and when there were scary scenes,they were utterly terrifying when the kids were locked in the shed and they saw the witch at the end of the room that was very scary and pretty disgusting. The ending is why I did not give the film a ten it was really weird and then after I had to find out what it was about on Wikipedia and I'm guessing that she became a witch in the woods because she signed some contract with the devil disguised a goat?? Well anyway,the witch was a very good horror film with very scary and disturbing scenes that should honestly be for 18+"
" I just don't care...
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"So there's a community of witches living in the woods who feed off baby's blood to keep themselves young (cheesy) and who get their instructions through a black billy-goat masquerading as the devil in the family shed? Really?The dialogue was miserable and the acting not that good, regardless of what other people say.There are some merits to this film, and it's definitely good enough to get a sarcastic review, but don't think this is going to be a gripping horror/thriller - it's not.Getting back to the 'scintillating' plot; after being isolated, hungry and cut-off from the rest of society, the family end up accusing each other of evil, fighting in-house as to who's the most evil (you decide), culminating in the prettiest being the only survivor of the devil-induced family feud, serving the sole purpose of her having a warped enough mind to lead her into madness and willingly join the coven of witches in the woods.I didn't see a flash of inspiration to suggest that the girl could be or become one of the witches, just that she ended up being one after all. It's nothing more than a mish-mash of rather unimaginatively implemented folk-tale ideas."
" Moody, raw and disturbing.
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"I don't quite know what to say about ""The Witch"", but I'll certainly try. To sum it up in a stupid way, it's about a family of settlers coming to New England from England. They're extremely religious, to the point where they are driven off from an already religious community. So they live alone in the crude wilderness. Life is hard. They live in poverty, under all kinds of stress and tragic events soon follow. There might or might not be a witch involved. That is all, no spoilers.""The Witch"" is a horror movie that is actually a movie. It's not a soulless studio product, it's not about jumpscares or about dumb and uninteresting characters you won't care about. It doesn't dance around hard subjects, and if it wants to show you something, it doesn't shy away. It has that '70s movie feeling to it, so the quality is there. The craft of cinema is continuously on display. It's very well shot, very well paced, filled with exceptional acting and it takes a minimalist approach to almost everything. The locations and clothing feel so real, because they are. You feel like you are in the dirt with these people. Religion is a big part of the movie. I think many people might avoid it for that, religious and non-religious alike, but hear me out. The religion of these people certainly is of a strict kind. Many might find it offensive, as if the movie is making a statement against religion or Christianity in general. Maybe it is, maybe not so much, but I, as a Christian, didn't take offense to it. In fact the movie might have worked on me better because of it. I did recognize parts of myself in some of these characters. Many people back then treated their religion with utmost importance to the point of raw harshness, and I like how this movie shows it. What I like about the religious aspect (which is always present in the film) is that the characters aren't made to be ""evil"". You certainly question them a lot and some of their words or actions do seem outright crazy, but ultimately the movie shows them as real people under unimaginable stress, not so much as villains - which is vital for the movie to work. And the movie works. I was always questioning the main characters, their mental stability, but I was also sensing that perhaps there really is something dangerous and evil out there. It's not a Shyamalan movie that just takes a sudden turn in the end, but there are turns. And when they come, they are deserved, and they do not destroy the earlier parts of the movie leading to those revelations. There is ambiguity to this film though, and I think it's not about the writer/director Robert Eggers being lazy. It certainly doesn't feel like a ""just bring your interpretation to it"" - hack job, but instead it leaves you thinking about it. Not out of frustration on your part or pretentiousness from the writer's part, but out of curiosity.The actors are top-notch. Veterans Kate Dickie and Ralph Ineson are outstanding which is a given. The two older children are played by Harvey Scrimshaw and Anya Taylor-Joy. Scrimshaw and Taylor-Joy are excellent, and Taylor-Joy really steals some low-key moments. She has a good career in front of her, it's easy to see. It was these two people that stole the show, and I haven't seen them anywhere before this. I'm glad I did now. However I want to make a special mention about the little kids. You know this isn't a soulless Hollywood movie when the child actors don't make you cringe. In fact, some of the most harrowing scenes in this movie involve pretty good child acting. So well done, Lucas Dawson and Ellie Grainger. I already complimented Robert Eggers. He did a very good job, and I'm looking forward to his future movies. I must also compliment the DP, because this is a beautifully shot movie. The shots are well framed and lit, and they linger on for quite some time at the right moments. I got some ""Shining"" vibes from some of the visual aspects. It's not that great, but there are some similarities. Same with the music - it's not really ""just"" music, but noise to make you uncomfortable along with the visuals you're seeing. Just add the hard life of wilderness, and the disturbing mood is set. ""The Witch"" is a hard watch. It's not a popcorn movie, but it's not a shock film either. It's just so raw and real, and the tension is always present. The tension eats you a little and gets under your skin. There are some really disturbing scenes, and the minimalist approach works wonderfully with them, because the movie doesn't make a big deal about any of it. It just shows them to you, and they're so much more powerful because of it. I'd recommend this movie for everyone who hates what the horror movie industry has become and yearns for the good old days. I'd recommend it even for those who normally don't like to watch anything to do with religion or occult. It's a slow burner, but it's full of real, raw quality. If you want a fast-paced spookfest or a clear-cut story with every question answered, then this movie might not be for you. For me it's a gem. A gem that I won't be seeing again soon, because I think it got a bit too far under my skin and like I said, it's not an easy watch. Whatever the case, it's an excellent movie. Not just a horror movie, but a movie."
