" Dark and unique, yet overcooked
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,7,"""The Tribe"" is sort of hit and miss.While movie has no subtitles and tries to ""show, not tell"", in reality - there seem to be rather long conversations throughout the movie... in sign language. If they wanted to make the language truly universal, they should have relied less on this.Of course, without voice - even in unknown language, you also cannot rely on tone and volume. So all the emotions have to be conveyed by facial expressions and body language. Which - also - feels lackluster, despite otherwise fairly good acting from young actors.Overly long shots feel interesting in the beginning, but really start dragging on as movie progresses. Violence is almost comically high, yet makes little sense. Deaf students go into deepest depths of crime for money, yet movie doesn't quite explain what they do with it or need it for, other than weird ambition to travel to - out of all places - Italy.Protagonist's love for one of the actresses feels also overdone - in general - characters act quite emotionless and then we're somehow supposed to believe in sudden, overwhelming feelings of such scope that lead to such desperate actions. Nope, didn't buy it.It feels like we're watching just a fraction of a story - with huge gaps of it untold, yet it's at the length of five stories. And that deaf criminal gang gimmick got director too busy, so they forgot to flesh out rest of the movie."
" Silent but loud
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,8,"A unique film unlike anything I've seen. Deciding to watch it without being able to comprehend the language was daunting at first but I gave in. When you take away speech from the equation, a lot goes on that gets the audience immersed in the experience. The use of visual cues are important in such a setting and the director does a magnificent job. As a person illiterate in sign language, I had myself interpreting my own dialogue at times but the visuals kept my imagination within the constructs of the story.At the beginning you're as clueless as the protagonist who is new to this environment. The life of the hearing impaired feels like in a whole other universe. While keeping the unfolding events grounded to their reality, the story goes deeper into the dark world they live in. It's not for the faint of heart and is definitely not for people with a short attention span.How I decided my rating:Cast - 2
Concept - 1
Cringe - 1
Story And Screenplay - 0.8
Direction - 0.7
Adult Content - 0.5
Ending - 0.8
Drama - 0.7"
" What did they mean?
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,3,"I'm so sorry.Im not a fan of Art movies.This is a movie which is so hard to get engaged,too slow.Not my thing"
" Novel and interesting but lacks engagement
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,6,"Sergey, a deaf teenager, and is starting his first day at a special school for the deaf. He soon discovers that most things at the school are run by The Tribe, an anarchic, criminal gang of students. He falls foul of The Tribe and is bullied and attacked by them. However, over time he joins them and works his way up their ranks.A very original movie: no audible spoken words at all, hardly any sound at all, in fact. The idea being that you need to experience the world of a deaf person. All communication between the characters is done by sign language, and there's no sub-titles. Even if you understand sign language (and, unfortunately, I don't) you probably wouldn't be able to make out what they're saying - the signing isn't directed at the camera.So you have to watch this essentially as a silent movie, using actions and body language to figure out what is going on. This, and the intriguing plot (initially) make this quite interesting.However, it lacks engagement. The main character isn't particularly interesting or likeable, and the more you get into the movie, the less you like him.Plus, the plot can seem quite random at times. Having to use sight cues to determine the narrative does have its drawbacks...Overall, okay, but could have been better."
" what is the point
",2018-10-10 00:00:00,5,"First of all i must say this could be really good movie if we could understand it. But since whole movie is with on sign language, not just normal some way of Ukranian sign language, not that i know world wide sign , but still you can get few things but you dont get any dialogue at all.5 stars only for effort of all those actors who did good job, but director should at least add some kind of subs for others to understand.
anyway i would recomend this movie to anyone who doesnt understand sign language ."
" THE SILENCE SAYS VOLUMES...!
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,7,"The Tribe hit my radar a while back when I heard about the novelty of a film being silent in the world of the hearing impaired in a foreign country w/no subtitles in existence. What is essentially a silent film made in the digital age, eschews themes we've seen in other cinematic rites of passage w/silent thieves on the make all the time going from one score to the next. One wonders if the bleakness depicted translates to other schools of impairment around the world where the easy way out of dealing w/adversity is to turn to a life of crime. The choice of an non-subtitled version really puts the onus on our viewing collective who don't have the patience for this interesting endeavor."
" Not as good as I'd hoped, but the ending rocks!
",2017-11-06 00:00:00,6,"I had read about this film and wanted to see it, so I was happy to find it streaming on Netflix. The story takes place at a Ukrainian school for the deaf, and what I didn't realize until watching was that aside from a few mumbles, gasps, and background chatter, the characters speak only in Ukrainian sign language, without the use of subtitles, translations, or narration. There's not even any music, for crying out loud (although we do hear all the other sounds of the world though, doors closing and footsteps and things, the absence of which I think would have felt pretty strange).But honestly, none of that bothered me. Not having to read subtitles let me enjoy the film in a different way. Even if you understand sign language, I didn't feel like the filmmakers went out of their way to focus on the signing. Often it took place in the distance, or the character's back would be turned or at a funny angel. There are a few scenes where it's hard to tell what they're talking about, but overall I never felt like I was missing much. The relative silence added to the experience, and I even found myself at time subconsciously thinking that I was unable to hear, kinda like when I watched The Invention of Lying on an airplane and thought that I too, like the characters in that film, was unable to tell a lie. But that was the only good thing about that movie, if you can even call it a good thing.So, back to The Tribe. Unless you understand Ukrainian sign language, the characters' exact word choice is anyone's best guess, but the story is simple enough and told in such a way that it's easy enough to follow based on context, body language, and the things we see happening. I think it is anyway, unless I got the story totally wrong! But hey, it made enough sense to me! I may have been confused at times, but always felt like I was meant to be, like that was part of the story and the filmmakers' intention.But the acting didn't quite cut it. I don't think any of these were professional actors, since their main requirement would have been fluency in sign language, and it really showed, despite there being no spoken dialog. They walk strangely and unnaturally, as if uncomfortable on camera, and too often stare off awkwardly in order to avoid looking at the camera. In one scene, three of the main character push their way through a crowd, but the exrtas in the scene all but ignore the annoyance, staring awkwardly straight ahead or at the ground. And one fight scene toward the start of the film almost ruined it for me. It was too clearly choreographed and looked as though the characters were dancing. Fortunately, the best bit of acting comes from our lead character, who was well-cast with his perpetually blank expression.There are a few pretty explicit sex scenes, which didn't bother me except for the fact that, in the filmmakers' attempt to show as much as possible, it becomes pretty obvious that the sex is simulated, and the scenes are unconvincing and ineffective.I'm typically a fan of European film with long takes, such as the ones in this film, but too often here we see doors being left open for the cameraman to enter when they would normally be closed in real life. Sometimes it's excusable, but at one point a character who is being chased on foot stops to hold the door open for the cameraman behind him. Another time, an apartment door is left open to the world while illegal activity is conducted just inside, and multiple doors throughout the film are left open to the cold outside.This movie wasn't terrible, but the flaws, which were sometimes laughable, were too numerous to ignore. But there were a few things I loved about this film. I very much enjoyed the camera-work in general: long takes following the characters through various environments, down hills and through trees, jumping between characters. One particular scene shows separate actions occurring simultaneously in two different rooms, both visible in the same shot from the outside through adjacent windows. It was well-done and clever, but never felt gimmicky. I love stuff like that.And I'm glad that, despite the terrible fight scene I was forced to endure, I still gave this movie a chance and stuck around to the end, because the last scene is very very good. It's one of the best endings I can remember seeing in a while. It's very effective, well-acted, well-shot, and all around well done from a technical standpoint.Overall, I didn't love The Tribe, but I recommend it for for the ending, if for no other reason."
" ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,1,"My sign language review for this movie is ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž. I can't hear the people speak but I can hear the doors closing, footsteps and paper shuffling? The Tribe? More like 'The Stupid'. Were these guys suppose to be mute as well? Deaf people do make sounds. I don't think they were even using real sign language throughout this flick. Deaf Gangs, Deaf Pimps & Deaf Prostitute Lot Lizards does not equal a good film. What about the irony of throwing up gang signs using sign language. The awkward Deaf Sex scenes were hilarious and it was the only time anyone made any sound. This movie was weird. I wonder what the director will make next, A DEAF MUSICAL? You can't hear the music but you can see it. When they performed the Deaf Abortion I was Dead. Everyone acting or working in this film obviously wrote the bogus positive reviews. My 1st review saying this movie sucked was reported for abuse and deleted. I DEAFinitely want my $$$ back."
" Unique cinematography that makes the viewer wiser
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,10,"While I was watching the film I did not talk. When it was over I could not move, I felt completely frozen solid. The Tribe is not a movie that someone can forget the next day and it certainly requires attention. It is one of the films that leave you speechless because of their raw honesty, terrifying atmosphere and unique cinematography. Indeed, words are superfluous in this case. The Tribe delivers an original point of view and a powerful impact on the soul of the viewer. The director has made an unmatched achievement, in which music is not needed, voice recording is not needed. As paradoxical as it sounds the transaction that haunt us is the single sound of the door that slaps. Additionally, this movie has some very difficult to watch scenes. The harshness in which the story and the heroes evolve is indisputable, as there are some infrequent scenes of violence or pain. Powerful, straightforward and a testimony for a grouping of people that we come to understand rarely or never through the movies it describe better than anything else their story-only with them, the light and space-. Last but not least I believe, in contrast with some other reviewers, that this film stands up for its protagonists and that the director made a successful experiment, which theoretically is a new era in cinema today, trying to portray something different, with sensitivity and in contradiction with profitable cinematography and popular success stories. This film is about life itself and the need for survival and love. A little detail in the analysis of the frames is that camera never reach its actors with close-up. All frames include whole-body shots or waist. Hard light, hidden faces, angle from behind their back, we never watch their faces, their face characteristics and details from close enough to ""observe them"". Even in love scenes we watch their face expressions but mostly their body. The dynamic of the body is their way of communication and it has a symbolic role in the events. With this act, the distance of deaf-mute people and the part of the people that can hear or/and talk is translated into a cinematic angle which transfers feelings of isolation and loss better than any other way, making us feel and listen again for a first time."
" The Adventures of Deaf Kids in Post-Soviet Era Ukraine
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,8,"As a credit to the film-makers the opening screen advises viewers that there is no dialog or sub-titles, the film is completely in sign language. Can you follow the film without knowing sign language? Absolutely, you will miss some of what they are trying to convey but other parts are perfectly clear, in some scenes there is absolutely no mistaking what the characters are talking about. The film starts off with a boy showing up at a rundown boarding schools for the deaf, the school seems to have a large population of students however the film focus on a small core group of 2 girls and 4 boys; following these students as they build their criminal empire with the help of their wood shop teacher they graduate from extorting money from other students, to theft, robbery, prostitution and murder. The new kid is jumped into ""The Tribe"" and works his way up the ladder and back down again, at first administering a few kicks to a shopper they rob and beat for some beer and wine, then moving along to become the pimp for the two prostitute classmates. Falling in love with one of the girls begins the downward spiral and exile from ""The Tribe"" out on his own to make money and survive he resorts to robbery and murder. The film takes place in the Ukraine but it could be anywhere, there is a total lack of supervision for the kids at the boarding school and they seem to have quite a bit of free time to spend on their criminal activities, our core group of students have keys to the school and come and go as they please, in the end the film is about a group of kids doing what they need to do to survive and their eventual failure."
