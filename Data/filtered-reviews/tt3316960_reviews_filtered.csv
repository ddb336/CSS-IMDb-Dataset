" What an important movie, especially for people living with Alzheimer's to know they aren't alone.
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,"A gripping and emotional movie that pulls no punches, lays it all out on the progression, and then ultimate reality of Alzheimer's disease. There are all A list actors in the movie who bring the story to life brilliantly, and of course, Julianne Moore is always amazing."
" Liked it
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,"Was a masterpiece üëè
Great actress. I liked the description of her feeling..........."
" A call to enjoy the beauty in our fragile existence
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,10,"I wish I didn't know about the topic of the movie prior to watching it to be caught by surprise.Alice is an accomplished intelligent woman every woman would envy. She keeps on top of every aspect of her life and is the backbone of her family.The perfect picture starts cracking almost imperceptibly and the upcoming birth of her grandchildren serve as a great way to keep track of how quickly her life veers off track. Despite all this, her resourcefulness and her intelligence shines even more in her attempts to stay at the helm of her life and guide her future self.While the movie could get really dark, it has kept some lightness, particularly with the outside scenes at the beach and the love and understanding of one of her daughters.Through the husband, the movie painted very well how frustrated rich and highly educated people can be when they are caught up by something they cannot change.While many movies annoyingly lack the subtleties of life, I found myself replaying a couple of scenes to appreciate them fully.I was so engrossed by the movie that I didn't actually pay any attention to the music.I highly recommend planning a group activity after watching this movie to shake if off a bit from your head."
" What a great film
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,10,This film was so good from start to finish. All the actors were great especially Julianne Moore who played Alice so well. It's very sad so you will need your tissues! I've seen this twice now and recommended to a few of my friends as a must watch. One of my top ten films.
" Another 15-Minute Movie Stretched to Fill Two Hours
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,2,"I paid $1 for the Blue-ray disc at Dollar Tree, but that was too much. Burdened by copious extraneous details and pointless development of obnoxious, self-centered characters, it drags out a plodding, predictable, pointless, and annoying story of a rich woman's mental decline. Why this fictional character would interest the viewer more than any of the millions of similarly situated real people was a mystery. Soon enough, I realized there was no reason, just boredom. A tank of tropical fish is more interesting than this film. After 15 minutes, I turned it off and read a book."
" Good Actress
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,7,"I congratulate the main actress of film. One of the best role I ever seen. She definetly adopted to role herself. I even thought she is a realy alzheimer for a moment :) Film's fluence and scenario were quite succesfull I never controlled clock. Film's up and down points were effective that is why her job carrier. You can feel the shattering and exhausting. But I wish the people who lives around of her was more thankless and two-faced like real life. They might left her after a while. Therefore I broke my points people is not as good as reflected here.
In addition, The productor should have used more flue coluors at the display. eventually we dont watch a love film there is a dram here I can say Haneke's ""Amour"" as a example its scenes colours attract u to display and u stand stabil. But I did not feel here. At least, Musics should have been more melancholic."

" So heartbreaking
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,10,"Rated it 10/10 because it made me cry, I hurt as much as alice did. Outstanding movie. Julianne Moore definitely deserved that Oscar."
" A very hard movie
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,6,A disease that gradually destroys you. A very tough movie about what this disease is. An acceptable performance by Julian More.
" Falling Down the Rabbit Hole of Alzheimer's Disease
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,8,"""Still Alice"" is deceptively simple; it even seems to descend into a public service announcement on Alzheimer's Disease at times, including the Oscar-winning Julianne Moore as the eponymous Alice delivering a lecture on the effects of dementia on the character. It's, of course, a tearjerker by the end, too. Yet, mainly two interesting things are done with the narrative that reflect the crises of identity and loss of memory characteristic of the disease. Two characters are essential in this; besides Alice, the other is her daughter Lydia (played by Kristen Stewart, who should've also received an Oscar nomination).Lydia is an actor and, thus, transforms identities as the characters demand. We see one such performance in a play-within-the-play, and she reads a telling script at the end to her mother. Not surprisingly, then, she's the one who inquires what the disease is like for her mother and who suggests she lecture on the disease's personal impact on her, while others may treat her merely as a victim, patient or burden. Indeed, at some point, everyone else does and drops away from Alice's story. Alice and Lydia, on the other hand, hold no secrets from each other. This reflexivity of actor-playing-actor, of character and identity transformations is furthered by remembrances in the form of home videos--seemingly taken by the beach house Alice now occupies along with her fading memories. The importance of these characters is supported by the camera's focus. From the beginning, of the birthday dinner from which Lydia is absent, the view is mostly on Moore. Gradually, we also see more of Stewart, too, until by the end, the camera also lingers on her.The other interesting thing here is the indirect allusion to Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."" To begin, it's in the title and protagonist's name, ""Alice,"" while her last name includes ""land."" How-land, in this case, instead of Wonder-land. Carroll was revered for his clever wordplay, as well the games of logic deriving from his profession in mathematics, and this Alice is a linguistics professor. This Alice's descent into dementia also fits well in the metaphorical sense of falling down the rabbit hole, to a subjectively alternate world where, like Carroll's Alice, she goes through changes that lead her to question her own identity. In the children's book, this could be read as a parable for kids growing up; here, it's Alzheimer's Disease. To top it off, possibly my favorite sly reference to Wonderland is the butterfly necklace, which the Alice here received as a child (from her mother according to a story she tells her own daughter, to boot). Ostensibly, Alice suggests the symbolism of the butterfly is that they have short, but beautiful, lives. Yet, butterflies also represent change--the metamorphosis from caterpillars. Alice's meeting the Caterpillar in Carroll's book is the most pivotal scene of Alice confronting her identity crisis, with her transformations being considered unremarkable by and certainly nothing to fret over by the calm, hookah-smoking larva. A lovely allusion."
" Lifelike portrayal
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,7,"Julianne Moore definitely deserved her Academy Award for acting in this film, which portrays a lifelike first-hand portrayal of Alzheimer's disease. It has a subdued feel that does not succumb to big flashy drama. Instead, it shows how the condition slowly unravels every aspect of one's life from career to family. At the same time, it is not completely depressing or heartbreaking as it balances out the tone with some positive moments as well. Overall, a nuanced and realistic portrayal of a serious condition."
" Review - Still Alice
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,6,"Julian Moore is without any doubt a great actress, but it is impressive to witness how Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland managed to write roles that fit Kristen Stewart and Alec Balwin.Unfortunately, except for its touching performance, and the suiting cinematography, Still Alice, according to me, missed great opportunities to construct drama and suspense. The suspenseful scene of that movie was defused by some Deus ex machina, and the film failed to introduce the last stages of Alzheimer's disease, as far as I'm concerned, bringing a relation to death would have enhanced the message of the film.As I said, apart from amazing roles, it is nothing more than a ""feel-good"" movie reducing Alzheimer's to a simple memory loss."
" A great lead performance within a movie that should have been more impactful
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,6,"Recently listened to The Caretaker's 6 part album Everywhere at the End of Time, which has been described as a 6.5 hour exploration- through music- of what it feels like to succumb to Alzheimer's.
So naturally, I'm now pretty interested in the subject, and this had always looked interesting even before my morbid curiosity on the subject.And look- this seems like a decent exploration, but at a surface level, with training wheels, with kid's gloves etc...
You know what Julianne Moore's character is going through, thanks to her excellent performance and the decent filmmaking, but you don't truly feel it.Maybe it would have been too confronting for most audience members to feel it rather than simply be told about it, but I think it could've made for something truly special. The film uses a lack of focus in some scenes to convey the fuzziness of Alice's memory, make-up makes Moore look progressively more haggard as her character's condition gets worse, and towards the end there are a few sudden jumps in time.I just wish the editing and filmmaking techniques had been more jarring and confronting. It's one thing to tell an audience about Alzheimer's, and this movie tells it well, but I wanted to feel it more, especially because in just over 90 minutes, it's hard to feel as much of an impact unless you're really immersing the audience within how bad this disease would feel.If it gets general audiences more knowledgeable and concerned about the topic, and willing to research it more in depth, then it might well have done its job.
I just think it could of tackled Alzheimer's disease more intensely, and as a result, been a great movie instead of a pretty decent one."
" Simple, Yet So Heart-Breaking
",2020-07-22 00:00:00,8,"Julianne Moore was (...) in this movie, I don't have an adjective to describe her performance. Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart were also really great but they were clearly outshined by Moore. The way the story progresses is so simple, that I find it weird that I still absolutely loved it. It starts as an intelligent self-aware woman, then her illness progresses bit by bit. The impressive thing about this movie is the family dynamics, dialogues and how real they all felt. The chemistry between the actors was even higher than my nerd classmate's grades(lame joke :p). To sum it all, the direction and the simplicity of the screenplay give a lot of space for the actors to shine. Magnificent, but I can't recommend this movie, the movie hits too deep."
" Moore alone cannot save a bland, clich√©d melodrama
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,5,"When I first saw the trailers for Still Alice all I thought of was ""well, Oscar bait."" It had all the signs of such a film. Yet another solo starring vehicle for someone previously nominated for several Oscars where our lead actor has some sort of mental/medical illness with family struggles that mostly get pushed to the side in favor of tugging at the heart?Still Alice is a very deliberately crafted movie around a striking central performance by Julianne Moore that can't elevate itself to match Moore's dedication. It won Moore that Oscar she deserved a decade earlier, but the film around her is nothing special. It's a shining example of how great actors can't help save a mediocre script.Alice (Julianne Moore), a linguistics professor recently celebrating her 50th birthday, begins to notice her memory slipping. She forgets simple things like a word in a lecture and gets lost running through campus. I'm not jumping ahead, this is the first 10-minutes of the movie. One trip to the doctor and she's quickly diagnosed with early onset familial Alzheimer's. Her husband John (Alec Baldwin) tries to do as best he can with Alice but struggles - he's a researcher drawn to a new challenge while being pulled back by Alice's plight. Her son Tom (Hunter Parrish) and pregnant daughter Anna (Kate Bosworth) both get tested for the disease, but her vaguely black-sheep daughter Lydia (Kristen Stewart) - who didn't go to college and moved away to chase a career in acting much to her mothers' disappointment - chooses not to. Lydia and Alice's relationship is honestly the heart of this story, and I wish there was more time spent on it.Directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland take this story and paces it exactly as needed to maximize the emotional weight. As the disease progresses, Alice tries desperately to hang on to her memories, but realizes she's not going to win this war. Her family, sadly, seem at a loss for how to deal with Alice as she's becoming less and less herself. It's a rather tragic decline, as Alice struggles to remember where things are placed in her home or even who her children are. As someone who has had family members suffer from a similar condition I appreciate the care placed on treating Alice's decline seriously. As with life there is no cure for Alice as she slowly vanishes - what's left is a shell that people still care for.This of course begs the question of who Alice even is. Our knowledge of her only starts when she begins to lose her memories - she's almost told through story. There's little grounding for the person, we only know her through her struggles. The story of Still Alice is exclusively about Alice's battle, and is crafted in such a way that it's meant to be familiar to the audience rather than making us learn about Alice at all. We understand her pain by placing ourselves in her shoes; who Alice even is as a person is perhaps not even relevant. Still Alice is oddly only 95-minutes long without credits and really needed another 20-minutes at least to actually have character; part of me thinks its minuscule length is a cover to hide how bland the story actually is.Compounding this is the fact that Still Alice, while solely being about Alice, relegates her family's struggle to cope with her to the background. There's no attempt to put importance on the care of those who are affected by this terrible condition, and it makes most of Alice's family out to be heartless - which I cannot tell if that was the point or not. Alec Baldwin's John in particular feels like a missed opportunity to show the hardships people go through for love, and his eventual defeat should be more tragic than it is. By not showing John's turmoil he just comes across as a workaholic who's more concerned with his new job than his ailing wife. This is Alice's story and those around her should be a part of it - pity that the importance of caregivers is lost.I just feel like Still Alice needed an auteur director to show Alice's decline in a more visual way. We see Alice's struggles as an observer rather than being a part of her journey. The blows to Alice are always softened by sentimentality over what she's had taken from her. It gets lost in the past while not showing the now. I don't feel like I've learned anything about this condition any more than what I've read in a brochure at a doctor's office; Still Alice is a missed opportunity to spread understanding.The direction could also use a tad more subtlety and less heavy-handed pulling at the heart strings. It's manipulated for sure, but nonetheless effective. The sad moments at times feel forced rather than organically part of the story, and several of the moments meant to make you feel uplifted just come off as manufactured to do so. You know what scenes will come: you know Alice will mix up names, forget people, not remember how to put on clothes, etc. You know there will be a moment before the final fall into memory loss that she'll have one last speech to show you that she's a fighter and will live life to the fullest and hope for a brighter future for her children (and win an Oscar for it too).Even behind all of these flaws, Julianne Moore as Alice is superb. Moore's attachment to making Alice feel like a real person losing identity shows through every mannerism, every twitch of her face, every word she both utters and even moreso the ones she forgets. You feel for her as she's desperately grasping for memories that are just out of reach, as well as how absent she is when she doesn't realize she's forgotten something cherished. It really is a tragic presentation of deep, unknown loss - one that you can't help but feel attached to and identify with.To go alongside Moore's wonderful performance is a criminally underused Kristen Stewart giving one of the better supporting roles in a movie like this. Lydia, despite her differences with her mother over her life, is the one and only voice that seems to love and care for Alice throughout her struggles. I almost wish this story was more about this relationship being mended as Alice slips away.Oh, and I'll give some marks for making the product placement of Words With Friends actually plot relevant, though it was incredibly distracting. The rampant Apple and Pinkberry stuff though ...Still Alice is a mediocre movie elevated by a couple of superb performances by Moore and Stewart. It's lacks storytelling subtlety in favor of manufactured moments that never allow us to get into Alice's world. There's so little time spent on anything other than Alice's decay that all the dropped plot points (lost job, children inheriting the disease, husband moving away, etc) start adding up to become a distraction that either should have been expanded on or just simply cut. Still Alice only lands out of the negative side of the ledger due to Moore's profound skills, as otherwise it's just a run-of-the-mill melodrama filled with clich√© after clich√©."
" I don't like dramas, but this one...
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,8,"Usually I avoid watching dramas, as I am fan for thrillers, sci-fi and terror movies. However, this drama is a very good one, revealing the aspects of Alzheimer and how this desease can break a family, and how corageus the members of this family should be. Love was the main word in this story so surrounded by real facts."
" Still Alice
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,7,"This movie tells a story about Alzheimer's disease.
Originally Alice was a successful business, and was also a professor of cognitive psychology, as well as her favorite family. Who knows that in the enviable life of others, she actually suffered from rare Alzheimer's disease. At that time, she could not accept this fact, and she was bravely coming out with his lover.
She gradually forgot the most familiar scenes in the past. She recorded the things she wanted to accomplish through video and writing.
She finished the last speech and moved many people.
We become ridiculous, incapacitated and funny, not what we should be, but our illness makes us like this. Live in the moment. No matter what environment Alice is in right now, there are lovers who have always been with her, as well as taking care of her children."
" Brilliant performance
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,One of the most moving touching and real shows of the decade. Julianne Moore delivers a brilliant performance of someone struggling with Alzheimer's. Must watch.
" Still Alice
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,7,"Moore supported the film on his own. If the film has a little bit, it is because Moore shows such a desperate and strong woman with her introverted performance and strong life perception. The story is spread, not choosing the dramatic climax with big ups and downs, but from a person's perspective, telling her love, her lover, her children, her career, her despair and reluctant."
" Memory will be forgotten, but love will not.
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,9,"My entire life is going away from me, I blame myself for not remembering things, the memory will disappear, but I will not give up, because the ambitious I was always convinced by the charm of communication, I used to be smart, I miss Myself. This film is very beautiful ... The director has a strong sense of the lens, the scenery and the characters are shot beautifully, and the whole film has a warm love flowing."
" Great
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,8,"The interaction between the characters is great. The family's way of coping with the disease is super real. There are no bad guys or saints in the film. And even Alice's shortcomings are very obvious. Still, it is very intimate and touching for the attitude of a family to the mother's illness from shock, acceptance, to heartbreak, and the impact of dementia on a relatively young business woman."
" A woman's emotional journey struggling to still be herself.
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,6,"A well executed story of a woman trying but failing to control, of what is a gradual loss of who she was. The slow but steady deterioration has the family fighting over what is best for her."
" Ugh!
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,3,"To me, this movie was very cold, cold, cold. Her family constantly complains about her illness, makes fun of her, doesn't help and leaves her out of family moments. The one person who was the least sympathetic to her illness was her university boss. The end scene was her doing her trademark emotional(albeit Alzheimer's)moments of ""LOOOOVE"". Left
ME cold w the lack of empathatic emotions by her family in this movie."
" Great story
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,8,"This movie was amazing and brought me to tears! Julianne Moore did an outstanding job, I would have rated this higher but I feel that Kristen Stewart was a horrible casting choice. Most of her roles sound so monotone and robotic, this emotional tale was out of place for her."
" It ends where it should be the climax!!
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,4,"I thought this movie would be so much better than it was. Julianne Moore was very good, as well as Alec Baldwin. But I felt nothing for the other characters, or their connection to mom. She never even goes into memory care or doesn't know her family when they visit and the paranoia and tantrums. I'm so disappointed. When the credits rolled, I was like, whaaat???? Horrible portrayal of an insanely sad disease to walk through anyone with."
" Julianne Moore brought back my loved ones.
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,10,"I've never felt the urge to write a review, but after watching this movie for the fifth time, it still got me sobbing.Julianne Moore has received the most deserverd oscar in history for this role. I love how respectful the film makers tried to picture Alzheimers disease and what's it really about: not the forgetting of 'things', but the feeling of being incomplete, incompetent and not even being able to trust yourself anymore. Thank you so much for making this movie. It helps me a lot in remembering my best friend and grandmother. I hope you guys'll love it just as much as I did."
" Depressing and uplifting at the same time
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,7,'Still Alice' is both depressing and uplifting at the same time. It does a good job showing us how it is to live with the Alzheimer's disease.
" Uff, That Movie Hit Me Like A Train !
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,10,"What an absolute tragic, sad and also wonderful MovieI cried many many Times , that movie really hit my Emotions and i had to cry a lot"
" The most terrifying thing about the film was not the life Alice lost because of the disease but the superficial life she had built until then
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,2,"I just read a couple of reviews and everyone was commenting on how the film does not show the truly horrifying dimensions of Alzheimer's which is true. However, what I found more horrifying was the total absence of love and human kindness in this movie. When I saw Alice telling herself in her suicide video that she had a great life and three beautiful children I thought to myself : what is her definition of a great life? A husband who only cared about his career and promotion when he found out his wife was ill? 3 children who just continued with their lives as if nothing had happened? Even Alice does not show any true love or compassion towards herself, she does not seek a therapist to deal with her own emotions or tries to spend the little time she has left after the diagnoses and before losing herself doing things she truly loves as a gift to herself from herself. When her husband refuses to take a year off she just accepts it and that's it, she doesn't love herself enough to offer herself the luxury of fulfilling some last personal wishes for herself and by herself even though she has the money to do it. She too just goes on with everyday life, like everybody else, trying to hide her symptoms so that no one gets uncomfortable. Nobody cares and she doesn't care either. They all just continue living their flat, dull alienated lives. What are the values promoted in this movie, that a successful life is a life revolving around a successful career and having no real and deep relationships with anyone, not even with yourself ? A life where family members treat each other like strangers ? No real conversations, no emotion, no kindness , no tenderness, no tears, no deep conversations, just people performing their everyday tasks like robots. A superficial life where the husband is more upset when they miss dinner with some acquaintances (who are not even close enough to know about Alice's condition) than with losing his wife. Where is the humanity in these people ? The most terrifying thing about the film was not the life Alice lost because of the disease but the life she had built before, the superficial husband she chose , the superficial bond they had and the selfish children they raised. No true love, no values, no real connections, no authenticity, no freedom but good jobs and good money. And all of this is served to the audience as the definition of success."
" Spot on
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,9,"I have a sister in law at age 66 with end stage ALZ and I myself have stage 4 terminal brain cancer at age 62. I haven't been able to adequately and satisfactorily articulate the effect of loss of memory as well as this movie did. I have lost everything, but I have memories that bubble to the surface that keep me going. Life is not about stuff. Life is animating memories."
" The dimming of the light
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,6,"Julianne Moore delivers an Oscar winning performance as Alice Howland the Professor of Linguistics who has an early onset of Alzheimer's disease which in the film spreads rapidly.Worse, the condition Alice has is genetically inherited and there is a chance that her adult children could inherit that form of Alzheimer's. It is heartbreaking to see Alice deteriorating as the film progresses. We see Alice confidently delivering a lecture but then she loses her train of thought on a subject she has spoken hundreds of times before.Co-director Richard Glatzer was suffering from advanced stages of Motor Neurone disease and died shortly after the film's release. However there is something lightweight about Still Alice, it lacks drama, it is too mild and anodyne. We see Alice being cared for by her rebellious daughter Lydia (Kristen Stewart) who is struggling to be an actress. Something Alice is not pleased about given her other children are more successful and Alice and Lydia have had a fiery relationship.Her husband (Alec Baldwin) is disbelieving at first that his wife could have Alzheimer's. He supports her but also realises the need that he needs to earn money and continue with his own work.Still Alice could easily had been a bland generic movie of the week were it not for the strong performances of Moore and Baldwin."
" A beautiful homage to the strength of unconditional relationships in the face of unthinkable challenges
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Julianne Moore stars as Alice Howland, a 50 year old at the top of her game who receives a shocking diagnosis out of the blue that she has early onset Alzheimer's.Her ability to do her job, enjoy her hobbies and even talk to her family is thrown into disarray as small but painfully obvious signs of her mental decline crop up more and more regularly.Moore won an Oscar for her heartbreaking portrayal of Alice, and rightly so - she plays two different people (and everything in between) from the celebrated, confident linguistics professor with all her personal and professional ducks in a row, to the broken, child-like person she becomes as the disease cruelly takes hold.Supporting her enthralling performance, Alec Baldwin is soft and patient as Alice's distraught husband and Kristen Stewart sticks out as the couple's youngest child, uncomfortably yet welcomed back into the family fold as her mother's sudden decline and neediness overshadows the airs previous issues.Between the three of them, they usher you through the family's struggle to come to terms with what is happening to their inspirational matriarch.
Still Alice is a beautiful homage to the strength of unconditional relationships in the face of unthinkable challenges - very difficult final scenes somehow leave you feeling grateful and positive."
" Great but..
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,7,"It was a really touching movie, her speech scene became one of my favorite scenes.. the problem is in the ending.. I couldn't possibly think of a worse ending!, with her husband gone and her daughter taking care of her.. and suddenly the credit screen appears and that's when you know that the movie has end?"
" Could have been better.
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,5,A huge letdown. This could have been an Oscar winning tour de force type of deal but it is more or less a semi-happy go lucky hardship film with a few red herrings. Skip it.
" Alzheimer's in focus.
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,8,A truly touching and poignant look at the effects of Alzheimer's and the stigma it can have when compared to other illnesses. It's quite obvious why Julianne Moore won an Oscar for this performance.
" Heartbreaking but That's the Real World
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,9,"I know that a lot of the criticism is that this movie didn't get down and dirty enough. Alzheimers is a horrible thing for the survivors to deal with. Perhaps it can only truly by dealt with in documentary form. Julianne Moore is utterly amazing and anyone who says this film isn't well researched did not read about her approach. Yes, there are things that could have been shown to make it even more frightening. We could have seen specific bodily functions affected. We could have seen more irrationality and pain. But it needs to be accessible. I believe if we are watching a fictional account, this is very well done."
" Still Julianne More in brilliantly written and edited film
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,8,"Julianne Moore is beyond brilliant and deserved the Oscar for this role. Alec Baldwin - I love him and enjoyed him in the supporting department. As usual I cannot state the same for the bland Christen Steward.The careful and genius adapted screenplay by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland carries the heavy weight of this heavy film. From the general premise this is a consistent picture. The background checking of the writers is nothing short of excellent, both in terms of Alice's linguistics professorship and her doctor's appointments dealing with the clinical delineation of Alzheimer's Disease.Great direction, set design, art direction, make-up, sparsely used score, all working in unison to create a highly authentic and emotionally intense film.To be honest, I found the first diagnosis scene to be a bit off in terms of both the performances of Moore and the general practitioner, but otherwise a near-perfect depiction of the devastating effects of life with AD.Highly recommended!"
" Whitewashed biography
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,1,"Why was this ""TV movie"" even thought of?. As a caretaker of a family member with Alzheimers...a living hell.
This movie saw sweet Alice, who is rich, has 2 homes, one on the beach!. Her houses are kept perfect by housekeepers, her biggest accident was peeing her pants...really????? Horrible movie and Julianne Moore was awful. This is a tv movie. Too clean, no true look at this horrible, disgusting disease.
Watch ""Iris "" with Dame Iris Dench, or ""L'Amour"".....not this embarrassing drivel....pure crap."
" Just Excellent!

" Left me quite unimpressed
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,6,"Alzheimer is a touching topic you can make the main subject of a movie very well and this movie's production is fine, but that doesn't automatically make it a good movie.
Julianne Moore has an alright performance here.
What I don't like, the movie feels too polished, I don't care about most of the characters besides Alice and maybe her husband to a certain extent. Kristen Stewart's character could've been interesting.
I feel like 'Still Alice' could've had more plot twists and a deeper storyline."
" Remarkable
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,8,"Beautifully shot and acted. Incredible perfomance by Juliane Moor and Stewart. The film is very touching and very smart. Alice is a highly intelligent woman who discovers early age Alzheimer and we witness her deterioration and the struggle of her family, each handles differently. Still a notion of positivity, they managed to make it optimistic and not too dark otherwise it might have been unwatchable."
" Solid, If Not Quite As Devastating As The Novel
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,7,"After reading Lisa Genova's ""Still Alice"" novel and being absolutely devastated (in both positive and negative ways) by it, I was chomping at the bit to see what Hollywood would do with the story. What I found was that the film version of ""Still Alice"" is a solid portrayal of the novel's events, albeit one that stumbles in a few key areas preventing it from being spectacular.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of Alice Howland (Julianna Moore), an esteemed university professor who begins forgetting things that normally come easy to her. A word in a lecture disappears from her mind, as does the directions of her daily run around campus. After a trip to see a neurologist, Alice is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's Disease and forced to confront the debilitating effects the illness will have on what had previously been her most esteemed facet: her mind.At its core, ""Still Alice"" is a very emotional tale of loss, acceptance, and courage. What Alice goes through will be alarming to all viewers across the board, and likely prompt some internal dialogues of the scary and uncomfortable variety. What this film and the novel really get right, however, is the inclusion of family into the equation. It's one thing to see Alice struggling on her own, but a whole new kind of heartbreak to see it affect husband John (Alec Baldwin) as well as her three grown children (played by Kate Bosworth, Hunter Parrish, and Kristen Stewart). Each of these individuals relates to Alice on a different emotional level and provide amounts of support and difficult as her condition deteriorates.I really wanted to give this film a higher rating, as the base material certainly deserves it, but there were a few missteps along the way that prevented it from truly being something spectacular:-First and foremost, more time was needed to show Alice as a successful professor and ""thinker"", if you will. The real emotional impact of the story is how Alice is losing the one thing in life she has always depended on (her powerful mind), and that is the crux of most of the emotion. I wish this film had taken a bit more time in establishing that, even if the runtime needed to be increased (it's only about an hour and forty minutes as-is).
-Also, I enjoyed the original ending of the book more so than the path directors Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland took it down. Genova's ending didn't pull any punches, to be sure, but it also provided a sense of hope in way is ultimately a hopeless situation (Alzheimer's Disease does not yet have a cure). This film tries to do a similar thing in a different capacity, but perhaps doesn't quite nail that aspect as well.Overall, ""Still Alice"" is a solid film depicting the rare instance of early-onset Alzheimer's. It may lack some of the emotional punch of the source novel, but that could be mitigated if the book hasn't been read before the watch. I can easily see why Moore took home Best Actress at the Oscars for her Alice portrayal, as she steals the film in many ways."
" Visualizing alzheimers
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,7,Intruiging visual description of losing ones identity. Emotional story of identity and fragility of life. The script that follows closely its source material does it by sacrificing some of the depth of its charathers. Julianne Moore does a remarkable role as the film follows Alice's journey in losing herself with a screenplay and filmiography that reflects her confusion and change.
" perfect acting
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,9,Julianne Moore showed great acting in this movie. She is really good actress.
" BUTTERFLIES DON'T LIVE LONG
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,10,"Alice (Julianne Moore) is one of the top linguists in the world. She loves her career and her own intellect (in a nice way). In the first scene we are introduced to most of the characters except for her daughter Lydia (Kristen Stewart) who is an actress who has to pay money to have people watch her. Alice discovers she has a rare genetic form of Alzheimer, one that she can pass on to her three children. If they have the gene, it is a 100% chance they get it.During the film we watch Alice struggle, degrade, and leave notes to herself, provides for an interesting twist.Julianne Moore won an Oscar for her performance. I definitely think Kristen Stewart does far better in a support role, than a lead. Alec Baldwin had relatively small role for the spouse. The family helps out in what amounts to a sad film about the end of life, although the film never enters the more difficult, end stages of Alzheimer. The film is secular. No one prays for help.I couldn't hep think about another film, ""You're Not You"" with Hilary Swank that received less notice, about a dying ALS patient. I think if you enjoy one of these films you would enjoy the other.Guide; F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" What an emotional story performed perfectly!
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,7,Still Alice is so emotional and sensible in dealing with the disease and our protagonist which Julianne Moore nailed it and reflected it's sequence of getting more and more into the Alzheimer disease and the movie is very emotional and it's sequence was quite sensible and proper for a person suffering from the disease. The movie failed to use the character better than this as it was overall very average in all of it's components but for Moore who did a great job and might have been 2014's best performance. 6.5/10
" Remarkable!!
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,9,"This is a truly remarkable film. It puts Alzheimers in a whole new perspective - how it affects those around the patient as well. Julianne Moore is excellent! The film is very natural, never becoming sentimental. The story and acting from the entire cast is superb. For someone who went through something similar on a personal level, this was touching, sad and heart wrenching. Although it was clear what was to come, I really loved the movie's ending. This was STUNNING!"
" Very depressing, but hopeful.
",2018-05-30 00:00:00,8,"I found the premise intriguing, and it's something I'm surprised hasn't been tackled so often on the big screen. Alzheimer's is an incredibly tragic disease that even to this day is poorly understood, and it seems an obvious go-to to base a story around. The thought of losing memories and cognitive abilities is one that terrifies me and many others, and is undoubtedly an incredible struggle to those who suffer from it.This is kind of a hard film to watch as it goes on as the titular Alice goes through the degenerative effects of her unfortunate condition. I personally don't have much experience in dealing with people with Alzheimer's or Dementia, but from what little experience I do have I felt Julianne Moore's performance encapsulates what this disease does to those affected and those close to them. As the film goes on, she gets less mentally stable, more disoriented, more forgetful, and more depressed as her condition gets worse, and this is even juxtaposed as she leaves a video memo for herself in the future to commit suicide should her condition get worse, and the difference between her in the memo and her in the present is clear as day. She becomes an absolute wreck by the end of it, and it's a shame since there's really nothing that can be done to fix it. Many big issues are tackled throughout the story, such as Alice's guilt upon learning she has passed her condition on to her daughter, even though she had no way of knowing she could have had this rare version of Alzheimer's considering her parents had died too early on for it to have been known to her. There is excellent chemistry between Alice and her daughter Lydia throughout the film, and the film ends with a touching, even if bittersweet moment between them. Just about anything that can go wrong does go wrong throughout the story, yet it remains realistically hopeful while diving into seriously dark themes.I would highly recommend this film to those who like drama. It's a very good film in general with an interesting premise, talented actors, and effective execution, and a fulfilling story that's handled with proper care."
" Great adaptation
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,10,"I really enjoyed this adaptation of Lisa Genova's novel. Julianne Moore certainly delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. I thought the best acting, however, was the line Kate Bosworth delivered, when she said she loved hot dogs. Believable."

" The horrors of Alzheimers
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,6,"Saw 'Still Alice' to see how Julianne Moore's universally praised performance would fare and also to see how the film would do portraying an illness as cruel as Alzheimers. Having seen myself what it does to people from singing Christmas carols recently at a care home, and having had a family friend who succumbed to it a few years ago.Finally getting round to see it, there was a good deal to admire about 'Still Alice', and there is more to it than an award-sweeping performance. On the other hand, a large part of me expected something much more, it is a brave attempt but doesn't explore the illness and how it affects loved ones as well as the sufferer enough. Which is a really big shame because the potential and ingredients are all there, the execution was inconsistent.Can say absolutely nothing wrong about Julianne Moore, whose magnificent performance, one of heart-wrenching subtlety and dignity delivered with incredible intelligence, is what especially elevates 'Still Alice' to a higher level. As to whether she deserved the Oscar, my answer is yes for one of the overall best performances that year and she is tied with Rosamund Pike in 'Gone Girl' as my win for the Best Actress category that year.It is not just Moore who gives a quality performance. Alec Baldwin is just as powerful and Kristen Stewart proves that she is capable of a good (great even) performance when she has a character and material that are halfway decent (not the case with the 'Twilight' films and 'Snow White and the Huntsman', but the case here). The film looks good visually, while the music is hauntingly beautiful and there is an honesty and poignancy to the writing, effectively chilling early premonitions and some interesting, illuminating facts.However, most of the characters are cardboard cut-outs, particularly those of the children. Of Stewart, Hunter Parrish and Kate Bosworth's characters, the only one to have any kind of meat is Stewart's. Can barely remember those for the other two, especially Bosworth's who is also rather shallow. Too much of the script is under-baked, too coy and lacks subtlety, some of it almost like a sermon. There is not much new to what is already known about Alzheimers and how it's portrayed in other films to much better and more consistent effect.Much more could have been done with the too bland and trivialised portrayal of Alzheimers (even though there is emotional impact), we know already how cruel it is but we don't properly get to see how devastating the illness is. Largely because the family relationships and how it affects them, as well as the full effects of the illness itself (far more complex and devastating than the film shows), are under-explored. When there are attempts at these, they do vary in how much they ring true or whether they're contrived). And the daily struggles glossed over completely, it's not just the sufferer who suffers and the carers deserve better than that.Overall, decent and worth watching but should have been much more. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

" Deals with its topic maturely and sensitively
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,7,"A good film that deals with its topic maturely and sensitively, Julianne Moore carries her character gracefully and wholly convincingly. I also don't want to pass up the opportunity to give Kristen Stewart some rare praise, as she takes on a role far better suited to her than most, though it isn't an overwhelmingly challenging one.It's unfortunate that in spite of the film's overall integrity, there are some scenes that look like they were extracted directly from a Lifetime daytime TV movie. Otherwise, the film is a fairly simple but most effective examination of Alzheimer's Disease."
" The Living Dead

Alice Howland (Julieanne Moore), is a linguistics professor at Columbia University and her husband a physician, is being sought after by the Minnesota Mayo Clinic.Alice knows something is wrong, others find her behavior odd or annoying, but no one would have guessed at age 50 her seeming absentmindedness is early onset Alzeheimers. Understandably, Alice attempts to keep her life as it once was. When her work performance slips she explains she has Alzheimers and plans to keep working. She is informed by the University that is not possible.Alice's husband is not the loving, caring husband you'd hope he'd be. He becomes annoyed and looks for opportunities to be away or at work. Two of her three children decided to be tested for early on set familial Alzheimer's disease.

" As heartbreaking as you would expect.
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,9,"I had this film for a long time before I watched it. When I heard about it I wanted to go see it. But knowing the subject matter I wasn't crazy about the certainty of crying non stop in the cinema.I don't personally know anybody that had or has Alzheimer's. So I can only view this film through my imagined idea of what it would be like to be part of a family that this terrible condition touches. From my narrow viewpoint I think that the cast and crew did a fantastic job in demonstrating in a more passive way how it affects the family. Their part of the story is important but the film doesn't go out of its way to over dramatise every possible conflict that will arise from living with someone that has Alzheimer's.I also felt and rightly so, that the more important point was to focus on Alice herself. Julianne Moore in my mind does a fantastic job in taking the viewer along with her.I passed over this film numerous times knowing how it would make me feel. Ever since I saw Iris I knew from past experience that this would be a difficult film to watch. While Iris brought a more turbulent narrative to the screen and reflected how monstrous and destructive Alzheimer's is. Still Alice offered an additional focus. How it can hit a younger person and how devastatingly quickly it can dismantle a mind.I have watched it now and can now recommend it to others. But I doubt I will ever watch it again.Not because it isn't an impressive piece of story telling! But because in the words of Chandler Bing. ""It's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!""It is important for these stories to be told."
" Beauty and Love
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,7,"This is a beautiful film. I was blown away by emotional performances of the actresses. Alice has had a nice and happy life before she gets Alzheimer, which rips everything that she has acquired through her life from her. The disease leads to her uncomfortable life, and she is not able to be like her. That is the thing we are the most afraid of. I t is important for us to live by ourselves independently and like our selves. Alice gets to have a weak recognition about who she is and people around her, which makes her suffer from it. However, the most stunning scene is the warm support from her family in this hard situation. No matter how worse Alice's condition is getting, they always stay with her. I was impressed with her family. Besides, this film uses a beautiful representation of a butterfly as a short life, which reminds us of a short life as same as Alice. Meanwhile, the camera work is reflected by Alice's condition. As she got worse, the monitor gets vague. We can see things as same as Alice. The last scene also moved my heart."
" sad story about an undeniable truth
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,9,"I felt so sad about the Alice and I cried a lot during the film. I liked it so much and think it is good for our parents to watch this film and be grateful about their health, but paradoxically I feel it will depress them a lot and may has a negative impact on older people, so I don't know o whom I can recommend it!"
" Still Alice
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"'Still Alice' is a film that boasts a remarkable central performance from Julianne Moore. It tells the story of a University linguistics professor (Moore) as she is diagnosed a rare form of Auzheimer's disease.Richard Glatzer's direction of the movie can be viewed as a parallel to his own life and personal struggle as he lived with ALS disease. 'Still Alice' is full of emotive shots as the characters show care and support to Moore as she tries to continue juggling her career and family life with the disease. Aspects such as the music and cinematography is given a very straight-forward approach to allow the actors' performances to tell the story and to add a true to life direction.Based on the novel of the same name written by Lisa Genova, the screenplay is very faithfully adapted. The film really focuses on the story and the dialogue between the characters and some scenes and interactions are extremely moving thanks to how well it is written.Julianne Moore is perfect as the main character. She portrays her struggle with the disease with so much inner strength and dignity. Moore is supported by a solid cast such as Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart but are outshone by her brilliant performance.Overall, 'Still Alice' is a very good film. It is very touching and moving tale about coping with such a life changing and destructive disease. However, it seems to only be memorable due to Julianne Moore's incredible acting. I have given this film a final rating of 3.5 stars."
" Excellent portrayal of ALZ, only one false note.......
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,8,"I will not belabor the points made by so many who have already contributed glowing reviews to this movie, which features one of my favorite actresses (Julianne Moore) deliver one of her finest performances. There was one note, however, which I found to be incredibly ham-fisted and which detracted from my overall enjoyment of an otherwise outstanding movie:SPOILER ALERT!!!! =================In the scene where Alice is about to drink down all of the Rohypnol tablets which she hoarded while still lucid and coherent, at the EXACT moment that she raised the tablets to her lips, the front door slammed shut as her daughter entered the house, alarmed that her mother had been left alone for the day. Of course, in true Hollywood fashion, this caused Alice to drop all of the tablets to the floor! PLEASE -- PLEASE -- PLEASE do not insult me as a viewer with such a ham-fisted plot device! Rather let the daughter enter the home a half hour later, in time to have the hospital revive her mother -- or rework the ending so that this scene becomes the final scene. But DON'T INSULT ME AS A VIEWER WITH SUCH A TRITE, PREDICTABLE NARRATIVE! (Also, Rohypnol is not available for prescription in the United States -- it may only be imported by travelers from other nations, in strictly limited supplies. How did Alice's physician prescribe this sleeping pill, and where did Alice fill the prescription? This is not nitpicking -- these are valid observations, and a reworking of the script should have caught and remedied these errors, the first being far, far more serious than the latter two.)This heavy-handed and blatantly false note detracted from my enjoyment of what was in all other respects an extremely moving, deeply touching experience. Obviously, this is not a movie which one ENJOYS watching -- but it DOES offer the viewer a portal through which to view the world of both an ALZ patient and the caregivers for such patients.Julianne Moore certainly outdid herself in this role. It will be very difficult for her to rise to so high a bar in future productions (""Children of Men"" came close, albeit an earlier work than ""Still Alice"")....PHILIP CHANDLER"
" Still Alice
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"This indie movie is about a woman who recently found out that she was with Alzheimer's disease. The diagnose gradually changed her attitudes towards life. At that moment, she had a successful career as a PhD in Columbia University and also owned a perfect family. Memories fading away, she made several decisions, including spent more time with her family, made a speech in front of a group of Alzheimer patients and recorded a video to instruct herself to suicide. On the one hand, the movies shot the process which the decisions came up in Alice's mind and formed finally. On the other hand, Alice's family also experienced a series of changes. The lines which I remembered most clearly is from Alice's speech at the Alzheimer's Association - ""But I still have moments in the day of pure happiness and joy. And please do not think that I am suffering, I am not suffering. I am struggling, struggling to be a part of things, to stay connected to who I once was. So, living in the moment I tell myself"". Living in the moment, that is the exact gist I analyzed from this movie. It is also the most moving character of the heroine. It is hard to imagine such optimism out of Alice, such a sympathetic woman that everything she had worked for in her entire life was going. Superficially, the movie is talking about losing. The true purpose underneath is reminding people of what we used to own and enjoy the precious present. You can never predict which one between incidence and opportunity will come in the first place. By appreciating the present may we be able to live an optimistic life and make something with virtue."
" Away From Her
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's Disease, a middle aged university professor tries to deal with the increasing confusion and uncertainty that comes with the condition in this emotionally charged drama. Best known for the fact that it won Julianne Moore what many considered to be an overdue Oscar, she is very good here and quite likely richly deserved to win. Moore captures the gradual stages of neurological decline with remarkable finesse and the writing/directing team of Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland afford her several moments to shine. An especially effective sequence has her enter her home and go from room to room in search of the bathroom, only to find herself in a near labyrinthine maze, opening and reopening doors that she has already tested. The first doctor's appointment that we see might be Moore's best scene though as the camera lingers on her face for minutes on end with a disembodied doctor's voice that is seen but never heard. Where the film disappoints though is in the depiction of the impact on Moore's family. She has three adult children, but we only ever get to know one in any real depth and while Alec Baldwin has several strong moments as her concerned husband, there are some odd moments in which we are unsure whether he cares more about his job, yet this angle then just fades away towards the end. It is a minor issue though in what is overall a touching, scary and thought-provoking film. Just what would it be like to lose your sense of personal identity altogether? Food for thought for sure."
" I disagree with another view on here-this movie is a good insight
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,10,"As a person with a neurological disease, and the daughter and grand daughter/caregiver of tow that suffered from Alzheimer's disease, I have to debate just a bit on one comment left here. While this movie is Hollywood, the story and cast did try to make things somewhat realistic and brought some attention to the disease. People do get a glimpse of the beginning stages of Alzheimer's, I don't think anyone is ready to watch the true heartbreak of the end result. The idea behind the movie was the impact on Alice and then her family, this could have been explored more, but it is a 2 hour movie. I was glad they stuck with Julianne's character and the digression into her past, which is of course what happens. The moment of the left suicide instructional video when Alice could not follow the simplest of instructions, shows the disease and how debilitating it is, even early on. The secondary characters, were just that, secondary and what are they supposed to do? In this respect, the movie hit a home run..absolutely. The question being ""What do we do with her now and who cares what Lydia thinks?"" I was impressed that one of the family members (like myself) choose to alter their lives and care for someone who ultimately has no idea who they are.The end, well..if you saw the movie you most likely had known someone with the disease. I thought they ended that in a positive way."
" Still Alice - An Eye-Opener About Alzheimer's
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,8,"What a movie. I read that it's heart-breaking (what else could you expect from a drama), yet I couldn't imagine how strong the feeling will be. ""Still Alice"" introduces the viewer with the hardships that a person with Alzheimer's and their closest relatives are facing. Throughout the movie you get familiar with degradation of the main character's personality, caused by gradation of the disease. Alec Baldwin and Kristen Stewart did a great job fulfilling such strong supporting roles. Kristen Stewart remarkably embodied Alice Howland's youngest daughter Lydia, which suffered seeing her mother struggle with day-to-day tasks. Julianne Moore managed to not annoy me, so I consider it as a job well done."
