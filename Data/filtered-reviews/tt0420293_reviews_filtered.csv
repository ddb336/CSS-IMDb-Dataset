" Amateur hour...
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,1,Lasted about 20 mins....seems like they dragged a few students in off the street and filmed it in someone's garage....
" Slow and very boring
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,1,The movie is too slow and very boring.I felt disappointin the end.
" An Intense, well acted and thought provoking piece on abuse and masculinity
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,9,"Initially, I didn't expect The Stanford Prison Experiment to be as believable as it was but it really is quite an uncomfortable watch at times. You'll often question the experiment in the beginning of the film but you'll soon start to recognise the behaviour of the subjects and why they act the way they do. I think anyone who has been intimidated or even belittled or bullied by someone in authority can relate to this movie; especially if you're male considering the clear focus on toxic masculinity in this movie. As a viewer, I was in a consistent dread as to what would happen next in the experiment.The cinematography is very consistent, opting for close up shots to create a real sense of claustrophobia. Combined with the light but sharp original score, an uneasy atmosphere is created.It's not a film for everyone due to its intensity and some viewers may have their own lack of disbelief in the way characters act and the experiment itself but the true accounts and documentation of the real life experiment gives the film a real sense of integrity and punch."
" Extremely disturbing
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,10,A very well produced and realistic interpretation of the real thing. Utterly convincing.
" Good story about power structures / hierarchies
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Story:
Gave me Finnish Army vibes. Movie can be reflected in so many irl-situations, especially in the army, where there is strict power and authority hierarchies.Acting:
I don't know how the real experiment went exactly, but the acting was quite believable in my opinion. It's hard to believe that the actual students would have been as beliveable as ""guards"" in the real experiment."
" Instructive
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"It's the sad truth but I hate how they have ended with a huge lie ""no long time side effects have been observed"" so Zimbardo continued his studies. Why did they ""omit"" that one tried to kill himself as a side effect of that experiment?"
" I prefer the 2010 version tbh
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,6,"I assume that this version is a lot more accurate than the 2010 version but as a film, the other one is better imo.Not saying that this isn't a good film though and it is definitely worth a watch.I know the experiment is more about the guards rather than the prisoners and how people go mad with power etc...But as someone who has been to prison (admittedly in England and not America) I genuinely don't get how those lads were messed up after 2 days. I suffer from a plethora of mental illnesses and I first went to jail at 16, this lot were 22 odd and with apparent clean bills of health.Either there are some major underlying issues with the subjects, or they're fraggles...OR the whole experiment and psychological damage was a work!"
" Why did no one just throw hands
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,6,"I'm not being funny but I just shout riot and go for the sods. Like I'd literally plant every guard into the ground. It's crazy snakey from the first guy who got out not to come back and get the others out. I found it average, it could've definitely been a lot better. It definitely didn't dazzle me so it's gets an average 6."
" It's a hard watch. But in a good way
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,7,"Wow ok, I didn't expect the level of sheer intensity when I put this film on.So as I'm sure everyone is aware of, this is a true story. I had absolutely no prior knowledge of this experiment nor did I research it beforehand. Sometimes you can watch a true story film and be left a little confused as you didn't know the story prior, but this definitely works as a standalone.So the film. Well I have to say I am impressed. It's a film that is really hard hitting to say the least. It's something that fully resonates with you hours after you've watched. The acting was absolutely superb from everyone, you hated the guards and had sympathy for the prisoners. To feel that kind of emotion on such a large scale takes great acting skills. Even though you know what the ending is going to be, you're still left anxious to know what happens next and the overall deterioration of the prisoners and the guard power was really hard hitting and written so well.I personally would have liked to have seen maybe a little more from the prisoners after the experiment ends. How did they feel once released? Etc. The film doesn't have that rewatch factor either due to the hardcore nature of the film.Overall though it's a film id definitely recommend to anyone who hasn't seen. Just get ready for the emotional rollercoaster of it all."
" ""We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be""
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,8,"In 1971 psychologist Philip Zimbardo simulated a prison environment at Stanford. A small group of paid voluntary subjects were chosen from college students, whom the experimenters divided into prisoners and guards. An artificial prison was made in a school hallway, having rooms with little more than cots for cells, a closet for solitary confinement, and no precise way of telling the passage of time. Guards were dressed in uniforms and sunglasses, serving in round-the-clock shifts, and addressed as ""Mr. Corrective Officer""; prisoners were clothed in gowns, never leaving the premises but instead splitting their time between being locked in a cell with a few other prisoners and meeting together for meals and correctional drills, and assigned alternate identities including criminal histories and numbers for names. Prisoners were brought to the facilities with a realistic arrest in a police car, blindfolded until their arrival at the site. Researchers monitored the experiment with a camera in the hallway and microphones in the cells, occasionally engaging with the simulation by role-playing as wardens or other prison personnel. A man who spent a considerable amount of time in an actual prison is a technical advisor. Initially slated for 2 weeks, the demonstration ended after 5 days as it began to spiral out of control.Familiar with the real-life study from an intro to psychology class, I grabbed a copy of this film knowing little more about it than what I saw from its trailer online. I've only seen the film once or twice before, but this time especially I noticed (perhaps like Dr. Zimbardo) how difficult it was to peel my eyes away from what was happening on the screen. I feel the study and the film raise ethical questions that have far-reaching implications concerning many aspects of life inside and outside of the prison: playacting and imitation (of figures from movies and television, for example), authority and accountability, individuality and dehumanization, obedience and (civil or uncivil) disobedience, confinement and surveillance, and punishment and rehabilitation, to name a few.Most compelling to me is how the film's events, escalating to a point where they border on the absurd, unfold. We watch a subtle and incremental but rapid erosion of humanity and dignity; a blurring of the lines between passive observation and active participation in the study; voluntary prisoners resigning to fates and humiliating treatment ill-suited for their true law-abiding selves, but remaining a part of the study regardless; guards who start to misuse their power once they realize it is unchecked, even though (whether the participants are aware of it or not) the difference between them and their prisoners may be as minor as a coin toss.There is a scene where a colleague asks Zimbardo what his independent variables are, trying to align the experiment with ones past. I don't know if there have been studies quite like this before or since. And perhaps for good reason, because while the exploratory study was highly and deeply instructive, its degrees of freedom and findings as shown here crack open a door for us to peer into a disturbing side of life and human nature.To be sure, many factors played into making this film what it is: Spectacular performances, direction, sound and camera work, and many others. The study alone is captivating, and the effect of putting these all together in film is spellbinding!"
" Very underated
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,10,The kid from sky high is absolutely incredible in this
" Would have made for a better play.
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,5,"Although I've since changed careers rather significantly, I am a theater graduate and spent years working in theater. My strongest feeling while watching STANFORD PRISON EXPERIMENT was ""this could easily have been a play rather than a movie and it would have been 10x more powerful."" It is already a story mostly confined to a tiny area, and it features almost nothing in the way of cinematic artistry. The acting, while often good, is mostly pitched at a slightly exaggerated level that would work much better on stage. The dialogue is a bit ""stagey"" too. And things like cinematography are uninspiring and unrevealing.BUT, it isn't a play...it's a low-budget movie with an interesting cast, an interesting story and a deep, deep need for an editor. The film runs just over 2 hours, and should EASILY have come in at 90 minutes. In case you don't know, this is a true story, about a 1971 ""experiment"" conducted by a Stanford research psychologist in 1971. He hired a bunch of students (at $15 per day) to take on the role of either prisoner or guard. Other than telling the guards they couldn't physically hurt anyone...they could pretty much do what they wanted. The scariest thing the experiment teaches is not that under these circumstances, the guards might be come cruel and the prisoners terrified and dehumanized. It's HOW FAST it all happens. The movie also shows what a horribly conceived experiment it was, and how terribly the psychologist and his colleagues got sucked into playing their own ""roles"" in this scenario. It's pretty amazing that people didn't go to jail and the looney bin for this little game.The young men are played by a wide variety of interesting actors such as the always good Tye Sheridan (MUD) and the fascinating Ezra Miller (WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN). Miller is a pretty compelling and interesting film actor, but in this project, he's just a bit over the top. His character's arc is clumsily written, granted, but he could have overcome this better. He's a great example of what I said above...if this same performance were transported to a theatre with an audience of about 900, it would be thrilling. Here, where we can see him up close, it's just a bit too much. Billy Crudup, as the shrink, perhaps fares best of all because he doesn't forget that in film, less is often more. He does a convincing job portraying a man who fools himself into thinking his ""game"" is advancing human knowledge in a useful way, and not just destroying the psyches of all involved.It's not a FUN movie to watch...and many of the scenes of tormenting the prisoners drag on too long or are too repetitive. It's as though the director and writer thought they had to make their point over and over and over. It just became a bit mundane. (Perhaps that was the point...but what it really did was kind of grind the momentum to a halt after the film gets of to a brisk start.) This is worth seeing, but it's also not the earth-shattering revelation it wants to be.(PS, if you have time, watch the two brief little documentaries...less than 15 minutes total.... You'll meet the ""real life"" main character.)"
" The Stanford Prison Experiment
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,7,7/10 - interesting look at an unbelievable real-life psychological experiment is a who's-who of young talent
" Okay!
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,8,"Things go downhill, fast. ""Don't tell me how power can corrupt a person!"" as Trent Reznor says in a song on ""Year Zero."" ""You haven't had enough to know what it's like!"" The cast starts out looking like runoff from ""Dazed and Confused"" -- partly because that film *defined* that era, gave us cues and signifiers to look for and mark that maligned decade.""Cool Hand Luke"" and John Wayne come up, because they're know them and they're familiar to everybody. The half-funny ironic comments come up, too -- it's remarkable how the acting is coordinated to convey youth, that these guys are just *kids*, and any responses are still the best they can come up with, not necessarily lacking in wit but bemoaning a lack of worldview and life experience and a full spectrum of response.(What makes the film watchable is that it's *lyrical* -- the use of music, and framing and cues guide us along so the experiment is bearable. Somehow, though, we've forgotten that modern cinema can produce standards as high as ""Winter's Bone"" and ""Take Shelter"" pretty off-handedly. Hence, we're supposed to put up with Seth Rogen.)One can't help but feel, like with ""Gravity's Rainbow,"" there was something in the air about experiments/Pavlovians/a need to see if stimulus-response would just explain everything ... but of course, all you get is a bunch of indulgences. Everybody's had it worse than someone else -- so, what's *your* problem? It would take another generation and the end of the Cold War for sympathy to get drudged up and register for growing child-people all over America -- let alone *privileged* children. After all, these kids go to Stanford!"
" Good but not as good as das experiment
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,Ok maybe this film was based on what really happened I enjoyed it but the psychological effects it seemed to have were quite minor. If some of them cracked up after 1 or 2 days then they must have been weak or have an underlying mental health condition. The film das experiment is better in that it has more violence and mental discomfort for the people involved. I felt more empathy for their pain. This film you never get past the stage that it is still an experiment despite the doctors and psychologists trying to make it so. It still is an experiment so you can't feel anything for the people involved. If you watch das experiment you will go beyond the experiment and be more shocked with the outcome.
" It's worth a watch. Perhaps could've been greater though.
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,7,"I don't think they quite nailed what they were going for with this film, but I can't deny it does make for fairly uncomfortable viewing - which is the intention, I guess.'The Stanford Prison Experiment' has a very localised and low-budget feel to it, things that arguably actually enhance the vibe of the production. The acting is up-and-down, while the run time is too long.Billy Crudup is very good as Dr. Philip Zimbardo, while those who portray the team around him are also solid. It's when you get to the 'inmates' that the acting gets weaker, none of them are bad but they aren't on the same level as Crudup & Co. - despite some familiar faces, including a few from 'The Walking Dead' world. Michael Angarano as ""John Wayne"", however, deserves praise.It took me a little while to connect to the story, it gets a tad iffy when it's setting everything up though soon finds proper ground in the middle act before ending kinda slowly; this didn't need to be 122 minutes.Would I recommend this? Yes. It's worth a watch. Perhaps could've been greater though."
" Interesting...but whatever.....
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,5,"Men all over the world....
Have done
1-5... 7-10...and up YEARS in prison
these guys wigged out in 2 DAYS.. LOL"
" Interesting, well acted, but not perfect
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,"Incredibly interesting, and brilliantly acted- The Stanford Prison Experiment may not be as great as it could have been, but it is certainly a very unique based-on-a-true-story film which is quite an experience to watch unfold. The film clocks in at just over 2 hours, but with the situation unfolding as slowly as it does, the film can feel dreadfully long at times, as the experience is truly hard to sit through and contain as so much happens throughout. There are several great performances throughout; most notably top billed actors Ezra Miller, Billy Crudup, and Tye Sheridan, as well as Michael Angarano, who all provide some truly impressive work on the screen. The film could simply not work with any shallow performers, and these actors give it their all when they are on screen, and the result it incredibly captivating. My biggest grievance with the film, besides the pacing, is the fact that it has so much potential to use here, but instead loses it about halfway through. The film begins to feel as it is building up to something, and focuses you on the 'prisoners' and their experience and emotions throughout it all- but somewhere down the line, it loses that incredibly interesting concept, and instead decides to focus more and more about awful things that are happening, rather than the true effect and insight of those it is happening to. In the end however, The Stanford Prison Experiment is unlike any film you have ever seen. It is well directed, and incredibly acted, and though it may feel more shallow towards the end than it should be, it is quite a interesting watch, and truly a film experience many will never forget.
My Rating: 8.25/10"
" Good Phsically
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,8,"Very good movie and actors
Should be a great experiment movie!"
" The Stanford Prison Experiment
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,8,"The Stanford Prison Experiment directed by Kyle Patrick Alvarez in 2015, is a phenomenal drama/thriller film based off a true story. I came across this film on Netflix and immediately became interested. Billy Crudup stars as Dr. Philip Zimbardo followed by other popular actors Ezra Miller who plays Daniel Culp and Michael Angarano who plays Christopher Archer. This film is about a Stanford professor who conducts an interesting psychological experiment in which college boys act like guards and prisoners in a simulated prison. Things quickly escalate from there. The film starts off by interviewing each student individually about their background and capability to proceed in this experiment. Each student would receive $15 a day for two weeks for their work. None of them had ever committed any sort of crimes prior to this experiment and were all innocent people. What becomes interesting is how at the end of the interview the students are asked if they rather be a prisoner or guard and every single boy chooses prisoner. Their reasoning is because it is less work and typically everyone hates the guards. The roles are chosen simply by a coin toss. As the film goes on it becomes apparent that there is a power struggle between the guards and prisoners. At first it seemed that no one took it seriously but eventually the guards became more assertive. Violence was used despite the ban of it in their contract. I thought that was particularly interesting. It was a fake prison yet the guards acted as if they were in charge when in reality it was only an experiment. The boys were stripped of their clothes, had to wear dresses and refer to themselves as the number on their dresses. The professor reasoned that it was to strip them of their individuality which I thought would never happen but it did. Each boy became more and more obedient and reluctant to act out. Watching the film I became increasingly angry how all the prisoners refused to stand up for themselves despite the consequences. This leads me to say my favorite character was Daniel Culp because he never stopped trying to break free from the fake prison. He knew that what was going on was in humane and in my opinion he made the entire movie all the better. Overall I think this film is a great movie for anyone. It is not difficult to understand and I personally had no knowledge of this real life experiment prior to the film. It is an eerie but remarkable insight to the unknown capabilities of an average person."
" Superficial too much
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,5,"The film could have worked better with its ""main message"", giving more to understand the real meaning of the film, but instead, they do an exercise of extreme madness, without criticism, without a real message. The film could be much more audacious than that, much more grand and better worked. That's it, waste of cast."
" Boring & Over Acted
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,4,"Yikes, for a movie about a psychology study, they sure did a good job of making it bipolar!!! I'll be upfront, I had high expectations on 2 fonts, 1- I have 6 years of Psychology, I was studying to be a Profiler for the FBI, & 2- I've already seen & loved the Adrien Brody movie version of the events! That betting said, I went into this with an open mind and an excited heart!Now that my cards are on the table, I'll explain (though I'll endeavor to save you from an extensive and comprehensive diatribe on pros and cons, background info, psychological references etc, etc.) to you the reasons that I stated that this movie is bipolar, and why I only gave it 4 stars. I say it's bipolar, because 1- there's SO MANY EXTREME contrasts in the movie, for instance, you have some AMAZINGLY talented actors: there were 2 prison guards, 1 prisoner and 1 of the doctors, yet the rest of the cast is SO unbelievably AWFUL, that they are on par with those cheesy, D- movie, 70's - style Dramas! Now what casting director would do that to good quality talent like that? The good actors would never work for them again (feeling betrayed,) & the director, producer, and the rest of the affected crew would also likely boycott in the future, because without quality talent, putting out a quality product is hard enough, but to do it with a situation like THIS?! It's like putting an elephant in a bikini! Another thing making this seem so bipolar - and it's a part of the bigger problem, which is that this is POORLY WRITTEN, & they DIDN'T pay close enough attention to actual facts! - is that one minute they're coming close to the truth about what happened, and how the guys were treated, the next, the script went off in stupid directions, like making the guys sing their numbers. There's so much more...But as I said, the BIGGEST issues is how poorly it was written, and how widely it veers from the truth!!! But I'll save you from further lecture, suffice it to say, this movie was LONG, & ANNOYING!!! AVOID IT!!!"
" Very nice acting! Props to the actors!
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,10,"The actors were on point. If y'all want to understand the movie before or after you watch it, try to watch the documentaries first on youtube because you'll see how good the actors played their characters."
" Nice but done before
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,7,In 2001 a German version was already made of The Stanford project. And to be honoust the German version is better. The story is still incredible but nothing new.
" good movie, bad experiment
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,9,"The movie reminds me a bit of ""The Paper Chase"", except that movie seemed to argue that law students SHOULD be degraded, while this movie argues that hard felons at San Quentin should NOT be (though they still seem to agree that college students should be). I had read that this experiment was halted early due to revolts, but my psych textbook never mentioned that prisoners were sleep deprived to do push-ups and jumping jacks. That will cause anyone to revolt and, naturally, doesn't happen in actual prisons. However, anyone who truly is concerned can watch several documentaries about San Quentin on youtube. Considering every prisoner needs a violent act on their resume merely to enter, it should come as no surprise that San Quentin's prisoners don't always cooperate, and it makes little sense to suspect the prison guards are suddenly the ones causing problems.However, most reviewers managed to review the movie instead of the experiment. I was initially going to criticize the movie, fully suspecting this could not be how the experiment went, but Zimbardo openly admits this is exactly what he did. To Zimbardo's credit, even the Unabomber might have been driven insane by an abusive psychology experiment he participated in at Harvard, so mistreating college kids seemed to be the sport at the time he conducted this experiment. Because Zimbardo argues that people in authority should not be cruel, he is probably not personally a sadist, but he might benefit from spending some time as a prison guard. Sure, you'll yell a lot, but it's because you're scared... too scared to be getting an authority kick. His primary consultant on the study was an armed robber who thinks ""monster"" describes the guy who wouldn't free him early due to fears he wasn't remorseful enough not to repeat his crimes. Zimbardo should have balanced that feedback with somebody who was paroled early due to good behavior. Did the parolee consider guards to be the bigger threat, or their fellow prisoners? Sadists typically aren't looking to wield their authority in a place where they are likely to get shanked. They prefer elementary schools, judicial benches or, as Zimbardo demonstrates, top colleges, where nobody dares to question them."
" Awful
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,1,Awful film boring turned it off after 48 minutes worst film I have ever seen dont think I have ever turned a film of that early before
" Disturbing reality
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,8,"This movie is one of the most shocking things I've seen and it's all because it's a true story of a so called scientist that has lost his humane side and enjoyed conducting a psychologically damaging experiment.
The lack of control on the guards shows that Dr.Philip was fascinated by the horror and cruelty human kind can create even in a simulation. The fact that he chose an ex-prisoner as a consultant shows that this experiment lacks all credibility because the ex-prisoner wanted to subject his negative experience on innocent students. A chilling movie until the last seconds!!!!"
" An experiment in extreme boredom
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,3,It was impossible to feel much toward this film as it's so unbelievably boring. Wanted to turn it off several times but kept thinking it would get better. Spoiler alert: It doesn't.
" that s the mess up drame i like.
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,10,"This moviei not to be funny,but i feel funny. guard is very evil.and creative.
make its like black humour something.good film ."
" Not realistic or accurate.
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,3,"They drag the movie on forever, doing the same old thing. It makes it seem like the guards have nothing to do all day but harass the prisoners. About 10% of the experiment is realistic. The original experiment itself is unbelievably ridiculous and unrealistic. The movie then exaggerates the ridiculous experiment. I know some people want to watch this thinking they will now be able to talk about prison reform and think they are a civil rights hero just by watching the movie. However, too much nonsense that never happened or happened because of an unrealistic experiment makes this movie annoying."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,2,"BORING, i keep watching boring movies. It had an interesting premise which is what made me want to watch it. but it just didn't turn out to be anything i wanted to see. also, there was a lot i questioned (1 viewing)

like why these people were going crazy after less than two days. when they went in knowing they were going to stay for 2 weeks. also, the humping scene at the end was the last straw"
" high rating because it's a must watch, but mentally not enjoyable
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,8,"This movie was introduced on today's modern psychology class in my university to talk about aggression and deindividuation, so I watched it.Blatantly speaking, this movie makes me uneasy; it's a perfect movie to illustrates what power abuse could look like.We, in a healthy mental state, are aware that what the guards did and how the prisoners are treated are wrong. Easy to say because we are taught that assault and abuse are not ethical, plus most of us probably never been in the position as guards or prisoner.But this movie (experiment?) makes you wonder; what would you do if you are positioned as the highest member of society (guards/polices are deemed as ""good people"" or ""heroes"") by which you are given all the power in your fingertips? would you act ruthlessly just because your high status makes any of your action the ""truest""? the prisoners didn't really question the guards' ill manners too because prisoners are supposed to be the ""bad guy"" who caused harms to the society, so they ""deserve"" it. It's kind of a paradox, isn't it?Other than the topic, I think the script is written really well; it's literally set in the same location for days but it doesn't feel boring. The cinematography and editing are beautifully rendered and the music really fits the scenes.I want to say it was a great movie because of the moral lesson, the storyline, the cinematography, and it is enjoyable in the sense of I didn't get bored, it will make you sit on the edge of your chair with thumping heart, becoming emotionally invested. But it's not something you can watch for entertainment; I'd recommend this movie for everyone to learn and realize that yes, evil is always inside us. It's up to our self and surrounding environment whether we want to release the beast or not"
" The Stanford Prison Experiment Perfectly Portrays Psyche Gone Psycho
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,9,"The Stanford Prison Experiment was dramatized and inspired by psychologist Philip Zimbardo's notorious 1971 study in which he required 24 Stanford University students to mimic the roles of either a prison guard or a prisoner. Zimbardo and his colleagues were interested in finding out whether the brutality reported among guards in American prisons was due to the sadistic personalities of the guards or had more to do with the prison environment. He transformed a hallway into a jail setting, with cell blocks and solitary confinement. I highly recommend this film because it completely showcases the structures, systems, the abuse of power and the fragility of identity, especially when considering the acting, directing, and setting.
It all started with a man typing out an ad. The people who responded went through diagnostic interviews and personality tests to eliminate candidates with psychological problems, medical disabilities, or a history of crime or drug abuse: all to be accepted into the man's prison experiment. With the remaining people who were accepted, the head psychologist, Zimbardo, tossed a coin to determine who would be a guard and who would be a prisoner. As the experiment went on, concerns began to grow as some of the subjects went a little too far - to the point that they had to shut down the experiment within six days from the start. Not even half an hour into the movie, one can see the power abuse from the guards, the emotional turmoils of the prisoners, and the psychologists getting caught up in the process as well.
One of the great things about this film is that it didn't stray too far from the disturbing events that occurred during the actual experiment; Alvarez wasn't too scared to put in the truth. On the official website for the real experiment, you can read about how things happened and what the psychologists thought during the whole process. Just from reading that website, you can draw MANY parallels between what really occurred and the movie. The only other movie that I know of that has a plot similar to the true story it is based off of is Walk The Line, which is a movie based on the life of Johnny Cash.
I believe the cast did an amazing job portraying the prisoner's experience. Ezra Miller's portrayal of prisoner 8612 made me feel like I was actually watching the real experiment unfold. This is an interesting role to see him play because I have only seen him play the Flash in Justice League. The two characters begin very similar in terms of humor and wit, but in the duration of Prisoner 8612's stay, his demeanor dramatically shifts to a dark and paranoid state. Another key actor in the film is Michael Angarano, who was also known as the John Wayne guard. He really portrayed how far a human can go and makes the watcher feel sympathy for the prisoners. These two actors were the best fit for their respective parts.
Another great aspect is the setting. Again, it is very similar to how the actual ""prison"" was set up. They had makeshift prison cells along with the crappy beds with green blankets and off-white pillows. They even included the supplies closet also known as ""the hole,"" which unlike most of the film, the lighting was dark and low, truly giving off the effect of being alone in solitary confinement. The hallway they were placed in was bright due to the common fluorescent lighting in college building hallways. The only other times we see a dark environment is when one of the prisoners is being questioned and towards the end of the movie when Zimbardo runs down a square spiral staircase. The lighting added a whole new aspect of discomfort and solitude.
Although it is a great movie, it did go very fast in the beginning and majorly slowed down once the halfway mark came along. They definitely could have spread it out a little more just so that people don't become uninterested when things start to slow down. I was completely interested over the duration of the entire film, so I didn't see this as an issue for myself, but it could be for others who don't like slower drama/thriller movies.
This movie did a superb job when portraying their theme of roles defining a humans behavior. At the beginning when the subjects were all being interviewed, they were asked if they would rather be a prisoner or a guard, of which all answered that they would rather be a prisoner because ""no one likes cops"" said by the character portrayed by Michael Angarano. The prisoners were chosen randomly by a coin flip, so there was no difference at the beginning of the experiment between the guards and prisoners. Over the duration of the film, the guards became the stereotypical guard that abused his power and after one of the prisoners was denied his request to get out, the other prisoners fell to feeling hopeless and depressed.
The Stanford Prison Experiment is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. Although, I wouldn't recommend watching this on family movie night. This movie does include disturbing content, which goes to show how the film parallels the real experiment. This movie is definitely made for a mature audience, but I highly recommend it."

" Gripping and interesting
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,10,"A film that really makes you think and question the abuse of power and showing how people can change when hiding behind the uniform or feeling their status is above others.
Definitely worth a watch"
" Suffers from being simply a re-telling of a true story
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,6,"For me, this movie just lacked the ""it"" factor. I think the movie did all it could possibly do, and did it well, but simply lacked the freedom to make it more dramatic. By being so true to real events, the movie lacks the extra drama and magic that could reel viewers in even more. There is nothing wrong with the movie by any means, do not get me wrong. It's an excellent re-telling of the events, but lacks the magic that could draw audiences in a little more."
" A must see movie
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,9,"The whole concept of the experiment that the Psychologist was trying to determine was how within we can be as good or as evil as we see. The lust of power and authority over another person is something that prowess is to be dark and overpowering.In the beginning the show almost depicts a drama of sequential events that lead to a result. I personally could not believe that a university would allow this.However when the credits role towards the end - I can only say this is a show that everyone in power must see.No human being has the right to have authority over another and no jail sustucan correct the emotional turmoil that leads one to crime.The world must realize that crime is committed from the effects of trying to survive. Society is designed to impair, hurt and reduce the ability to live. That is why over 90 per of the population lives in poverty and struggle day by day.Watch this show and then check to see if you to when power becomes of you behave in a similar way."
" I kept waiting for something to happen
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,4,"The theory behind the film was interesting and have to applaud it for taking the audience into the psychological depths of the experiment in the last 15 minutes however, I was sat there throughout waiting for something to happen, for it to really take a violent turn that would really snap them. Prisoners seemed to snap at nothing just to veer the story in that direction which seemed very forced and didnt show much progression. The prisoner assumed to be the male lead was the first to be let go and not to be heard from again until the credits are about to roll, not much character development and scenes do not flow together. The psychologists girlfriend is repulsed by him during their last encounter and suddenly at the end of the film it forces us to read about how they are now married without any resolution or again, character development. Very sloppy film with over dramatic acting and I would not ever watch again."
" Taut Psychological Thriller
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,7,"Fascinating film about the famous experiment. How accurate it is I don't know. But it seems to show how the participants slip into their roles, how the prisoners in particular were were pushed to the edge. It also appears to show the complicity of the observers in what happened, and questions the validity of their experiment in a number of ways. It also shows how power corrupts - apparently. But also, how easy it is to hide behind a mask or role, and whilst in that role, live it, but just as easily shrug it off."
" Admittedly conflicted
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,7,"I have to admit that my rating is conflicted between the quality of the film (the caliber of the acting and directing), and the enjoyment/watchability of the film itself. It was superbly acted and directed - exhibited by the fact that recognizable actors blended seamlessly with their characters and eliciting sincere feelings of contempt and sympathy. However, it was not an easy film to watch. Again, I think that's a testament to the talent of the artists involved.I do think it should be required viewing for psychology students - unfortunately this film was released after my college years.As another reviewer stated, I really would have liked to have seen more about the final repercussions: how it affected the participants once the study was over (one would imagine some could have been left with PTSD, if only short term). In fact the film was so immersive and believable that I wondered if any of the actors fell victim to the same tendencies as the original participants and got a little lost in their roles.I had to go online to see if there were any legal or professional repercussions for Dr. Philip Zimbardo or any of the other parties involved. The post-notes at the end of the film could have been a bit more comprehensive, as I believe there were certain practices/rules put in place for psychological studies as a direct result of this experiment (among them being the establishment of the National Research Act as well as the creation of the Institutional Review Board).So, yes, I would definitely recommend watching this movie with the caveat that you're not going to be left feeling upbeat or warm and fuzzy."
" Be sure that your appetite for schadenfreude is high before you start this one.
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,5,I knew what this was about before starting to view it but it was so intense that I needed to watch it in bits. I was already convinced about man's capacity to treat his fellow men inhumanely but half way into this I felt that the researcher should have been brought up on criminal charges. I'm still not convinced that this didn't do lasting damage to those involved. I watched this knowing that I'd probably not like it because of the positive reviews of friends regarding certain actors. Personally I think the film failed on that level as well because the actors are not identified in the beginning and the guards remain unnamed and the prisoners are given numbers I wasn't entirely sure even as to who was whom. That said. Man's inhumanity to man has been well documented on film already and this felt to me to just be more of the same.
" Bleak. Grim. But necessary.
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,5,"Although it makes for uncomfortable viewing, The Stanford Prison Experiment is a story that needs to be told. The actors playing the guards are fantastic- you really love to hate them! Not a feel good movie but an interesting social commentary on the influence of authority and power, worth a watch if that's your kind of thing."
" Interesting Use of Small Sets
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,7,"The creators did a great job of maximizing a single Stanford hallway and other small sets. I was mostly intrigued with the dialogue and action, albeit some actors had unrealistic voices which occasionally removed you from the film. Billy Crudup played a realistic Philip Zimbardo; I greatly admired his performance. I would urge anyone interested in the Stanford prison experiment to watch this movie."

" Beautifully done and executed
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,9,This movie matched the experiment perfectly and while it was beautifully executed and super enthralling is extremely horrific and traumatizing to see what normal humans can become
" Is a film about a fraudulent experiment by a fraudulent professor itself a fraud?
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,1,"A 'true' story about fraudulent researchers led by a chief fraud. Except that it doesn't show any of the fraud and hence is not that 'true'.
The outing of Zimbardo, the chief researcher as a fraud may be a bad thing for the movie but a good thing for science."
" Mindboggling Concept
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,7,"My friend, who studies psychology recommended this film to me as I love anything to do with how the brain works and the consequences that can come from it. I had a pretty good idea going into this film what it would be about. However, seeing it on the big screen was something different entirely. Just the way each individual's personality shifted and altered, and for some, adapted was a scary look into the capability of human beings, given the correct circumstance. The idea that we can take on another persona, and not always consciously depending on your environment is a truly staggering thought. While some may say this film was slow, it was a slow burner and I think that played to its advantage. If the participants went cray cray in the first ten minutes then it would be nothing to do with mind control, or authority or pure brain power. Not to mention it's entertainment value would be severely diminished. The acting was superb from each of the cast members. And while it was a lengthy two hours, time flew by for me because of how fascinating it really was. Scary to think this experiment really happened. Would recommend!"
" Director Knows Best
",2018-05-10 00:00:00,9,Disturbing film leaves you wishing for more clarity but I guess you can interpret the results for yourself. Maybe the director pulled his punches in the end for it lacks a real resolution. But this may be one movie where the director knows it's best to present the facts without interpretation.
" Decent movie but I prefer the older version so much more
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,6,"Das experiment is a much better more raw version of this . This is a great movie, but it feels so slow paced and not interesting if you compare it to the true movie.Gives you a good look at how humans can abuse power and their position of authority. IMHO just watch the original one, not this one.Waste of time"
" good premise
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,2,"The idea for this movie is good. It could have been exploited better.
Nevertheless it is worth a watch and there is some good acting. it puts the psychological in psychological movie, but again, it could have been better if it didnt try to stick close to the real events."
" so awkward
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,3,"Other than excellent acting by most, story was appalling, tho based on a true event. the only reason i made it thru the movie was to see before the credits role, what the outcome was. ill avoid spoiler alert. i DO NOT recommend this movie AT ALL."
" Disgust and Human Nature
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,8,"I felt very strong digust from the bottom of my heart towards the guards and Zimbardo. Thinking this is the intention of this movie, I think this movie has a very good plot and performance. The plot and actors' performance were strong enough to lead audience's feeling to the right direction.And when I step back and see this story more objectively, it is very clear and easy to figure out that this movie is trying to indicate how ugly and irrational people can behave.I liked the messages behind the story and the emotional transition that this movie led me to have.I wonder if there's any moral standards or guidelines for psychological experiments..."
" The German version is better
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,4,"Although this version is not bad, it still has this ""American Hollywood"" vibe.There is a German version from 2001 (I don't know if this is the first movie ever made from he book) which I like better. 
The American version is a little bit ""to clean"" to my taste. The German version has a more realness to the movie.It also stars a great actor, Moritz Bleibtreu, who also plays in Lola Rent. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT!"
" What the Stanford?
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,10,"The fact that this actually happened at a college, and Stanford nonetheless, just blows me away. Such an interesting story about what happens when people are put into a situation like this. Awesome movie"
" The Lucifer Effect
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,8,"Twenty-four male students out of seventy-five were selected to take on randomly assigned roles of prisoners and guards in a mock prison situated in the basement of the Stanford psychology building.Anyone who has taken a psychology course is familiar with this experiment, or at least the summary version of it. When put in a position of authority, people become the role they are given. The prisoners likewise become more and more like the role they are portraying. This in itself is interesting, but is only the surface.This film gets into the deeper story that the textbooks tend to gloss over: the nudity, sexual humiliation, violence to the point of torture. How the heck Zimbardo and the school did not get sued into oblivion is beyond me."
" Another very worthwhile production of a chilling real life experiment.
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,7,"The Stanford Prison Experiment makes for compelling reading/viewing, whichever format you choose to partake in, it's science gone bonkers and has the power to chill the blood. Did we need another film version? Especially since Das Experiment (2001) is an outstanding film and clearly the one that is recommended as a first port of call on the subject? As it is this Kyle Patrick Alvarez directed version is special as well, managing to get under the skin whilst being vivid in detail. Not just for 1971 period accuracy's (clothes/social traits et al), but across the board characterisations, as it's well written and performed.Not recommended for those who may be down on the human race, or for those obviously after a good time. But good film making is worth time investment, as is eye opening of the human condition. 7/10"
" Good movie
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,7,"I watched this movie with my best friends because we were really interested in that topic. the movie is better than expected; we thought it is going to be something unrealistic, something a little bit trash, with a lot of violence just to captivate the audience. In fact it is not like that, it is quite ""soft"". Nevertheless there is a lot of psychological violence and degradation of the dignity. We paused the movie a lot of times because we really wanted to discuss about what was happening. We cannot tell if this is an accurate job but it looks like it is. I appreciate a lot the context of the seventies :they made a good job with clothes etc. It is unbelievable what people is willing to do. We can act like an beasts. I would recommend you watch it."
" ""The Stanford Prison Experiment"" (2015): What would you do for 15 bucks?
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,7,"The question you will be continually asking yourself while watching the docudrama ""The Stanford Prison Experiment"" is this: ""Why in the HELL don't these kids posing as the incarcerated just say, ""F it, man! I'm OUTTA here!"" And then the more disturbing question emerges. Why on EARTH did the bulk of them EVER choose to stay?"
" Brutal Depiction Of A Real-Life Event
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,8,"The Stanford Prison Experiment movie portrays a real-life event instigated by the psychology department of Stanford University.In essence, the department decided to conduct a social experiment within which a bunch of students would be contained within a mock prison and would either take the role of prisoner of prison officer.The students were made to 'become' the role, and the movie covers the progression of how each student morphed into the mentality of either prisoner or police officer. It gets very brutal, and is somewhat amazing that it was ever allowed to take place past the first day (it lasted 6 days instead of the planned 14).The movie is historically accurate and does a great job of installing a sense of claustrophobia and a fear in the viewer. Upon viewing, some of the scenes seem far-fetched, but quick research will tell you that the scenes were based on actual events.A movie that will keep you gripped and appalled simultaneously."
" good
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,7,"(I don't think I actually reveal a spoiler, but just in case)Highly gripping and something about the 70s visuals as incredibly real looking (I imagine).I have a number of qualms with it, most notably the study leader. An issue others point out. As well as a lack of development or explanation on the guards, especially the 'quiet' ones.Perhaps some of it was due to the 60s just ending, or the selection of the actual participants, but I can say without a doubt that I would have acted very, very, very differently than those selected. For various reasons (experience/knowledge of jail, law, individual rights), mostly liability and that I've had the opportunity to be the only one in large groups to not be brainwashed/convinced I'm wrong.That is really my biggest qualm, I find it very hard to imagine people allowing themselves to be abused so easily and to not physically take control of their lives over the captors. Guards/Warden, etc.I mean, it's 3 guys to a 'cell', which does not have anything besides a cot. No water. No toilet. No tp, it seems. Something as simple as going to the bathroom is not addressed until about 70% of the way through the movie.Anyways, now to experience other media productions, and the real footage!"
" Scary abuse of power movie
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,8,"I love a thriller and this movie did not disappoint. The plot was basically a psychology lecturer (Doctor) get 18 young men to volunteer 2 weeks of their lives for $15 a day to be in a simulated prison environment. 9 become prison guards and 9 become prisoners.The prisoners are picked up blind folded and basically taken to a makeshift prison and the guards are in shifts of 3 that take care of the prisoners. From the beginning prisoners are read rules and they have been all told guards will not touch them etc.It gets totally engrossing when the guards realise they have power and they become sadistic and cruel and totally abuse the power given to them, acting out of character and the prisoners end up weak and their identities destroyed and taken away from them, 3 of the stronger ones coming to close to meltdowns and a breakdown.Such a good movie and to realise it is real made me shudder but it was totally interesting and I couldn't stop watching it. I recommend this film, its an amazing thriller and knowing it really happened makes it even more worrying."
" Difficult subject, but great execution
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,6,"Whether or not I would recommend this to someone else depends a lot on what they expect from the movies they watch. If you want to be entertained, this movie is far from entertaining. Agonizing and difficult to watch, yes, but entertaining, absolutely not. However, if you watch movies to learn something or to be moved emotionally, this movie definitely does that. Because I like my movies to be entertaining, I deducted a couple of stars.This film was very well written, acted, and directed. However, you have to be ready to watch it. It's not easy at all. If it's that hard just to watch it, I can't even imagine what it would have been like to go through it. I do want to point out to people who are outraged at the experiment and how people were treated that this is not very far on how people are treated during boot camp. Having been through basic training in the Army, I can definitely say that they break you down psychologically by dehumanizing you just the same. So if people have an issue on how people were treated for 2 weeks where they had a contract that guaranteed their safety, imagine how a 18 year old who just joined the armed services feels."
" Well crafted!
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,9,"Intense and gripping, as well as a disturbing look into the human psyche.This psychological drama takes a compelling look into a warped reality experiment. While this would be interesting in fiction, the fact that it is grounded in an actual events raises it to the next level...to an uncomfortable level really.Acting is spot on from both the main cast and supporting cast.Directing is on point.Cinematography is straightforward and well done.Music is appropriate.The story is not only gripping but thought provoking as well.If you are looking for a feel good movie...this ain't it. Not a huge budget blockbuster, just good story telling. Only reason I don't give it a 10 is that while I was engaged in the story, it wasn't especially enjoyable. Free on Netflix, more than worth the time."
" Pace a little slow
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,8,"Very interesting movie based on actual events.The actors all did their part, and were excellent in their roles, but I felt the direction and pace was a little slow.I also found it interesting that this (The Stanford Prison Experiment) is a case study for Psych students.It would have been nice to explain what effects these results had in today's society.Nevertheless, an enjoyable movie, I recommend to all.8/10 from me!"
" Why this movie is not good?
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,1,"I usually give 1 out of 10 stars in the bad movies. For me this movie is technically good. It has good pace, certainly nice scenery, interesting catchy actors, a nice color palette of gray, brown and dull green colors, as it represents the 70s. Also, it is based in the true events of the experiment held up in the Stanford university in 1971. The movie follows the true incidents in the ""prison"" space, the ones that happened in this famous university. I have seen the German version (which I think it was the best from any aspect, although I do not know if it is based in the case of Stanford university prison) called Das Experiment, also the American version of this, The Experiment (2010). What I liked the most in the German version and not in the two other American versions of this story, is the basic factor that urged me to rate this with one star. Money can give us a marvelous depiction of something in the technical part. If they (the producers and director) want us to believe in something, they must be perfect in the technical part for the film, so it is smoothly cooperated with our mind. Although in both documentary of BBC and this movie, the creator of this experiment, Philip Zimbardo, speaks about how it happened (he is also co-writer on this film) with details and in a spirited tone, he never seems to accept any kind of responsibility about what he has caused to these students being prisoners for six days under the submissiveness of their guards (students chosen with the flip of a coin). He only became famous, wrote many books and continue to works as a psychologist until today. In the movie, everyone is good in the end. Prisoners after all, will gradually forget what happened to them, and go on with their lives. This wicked treatment from the guards to prisoners, was a real thing. The crew that created the experiment along with Dr. Zimbardo watched this and did not want to stop it. They did not comply with the contract of this job, because they thought it was their right to abuse in such a way these human beings, that were treated after all like objects and nothing more. Americans used to apply these kind of experiments in their content, but also the American Army used to do it in other countries too. Until today, there are happening frightening and severe experiments to humans, experiments that are under the file ""Confidential"", in secret from the outer world. The U.S. government ""was led"" to undertake projects whose goal was to understand mechanisms of mass persuasion and the effects of coercion on an individual's self in order to ""crack the code of human consciousness. The Stanford Prison Experiment is not a different case. It examined the possibility of destroying an individual's sense of self by attacking his sense of identity. When I said above that everyone is good in the end, I am referring to the fact that in the end of the film, it makes no difference, if director presents us how the good scientist and psychologist will smile to his wife, or how he later in his interview will admit that this experiment was good after all, that it had a deeper meaning after all the tortures, mistreatment and hail of abuse. To me it makes no difference, because I acknowledge that this was a crime and this movie only tries to rationalize it."
" Whoever fights monsters should see that he doesn't become a monster himself: Frriedrich Nietzsche
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"This experiment took place at Standford University's Jordan Hall in the summer of 1971 by psychology professor Dr Philip Zimbardo, Billy Crudup, who didn't seem to quit realize what he was getting into. That in order to see the effect on both inmates and prison guards that being locked up behind bars could do to them. Given $15.00 a day to participate in this study and those in it divided by lot between the inmates and guards it at first looked like a harmless experiment and easy money until those in charge-the prison guards-started to throw their weight around at the expense of the helpless prisoners. It wasn't long that a number of the inmates cracked up under the pressure with the prison guards acting far worse then any of the crimes that the inmates, who in fact were innocent collage students, were accused or involved in the study.It was the captain of the guards Chris ""John Wayne"" Archer,Michael Angarano, who really went overboard in his actions against the helpless inmates treating them worse then inmates are treated in any major or minor US prison.That in fact had Dr. Zimbardo, in order to prevent himself and the collage from being sued into bankruptcy,halt the experiment after just five days of torture. As for the inmates they were left traumatized to the point where they had to seek out professional, at the collage's expense, help to overcome what they were forced to go through.It was in fact the captain of the guards ""John Wayne"" Archer who suffered the most damage to himself in how he acted toward his fellow human beings. A decent and likable fellow at first Archer when given total authority over his ""Victims"" that showed just how anyone under the same circumstances can act when given the chance. Which explains the actions of many of those in power, in law enforcement and in politics, that we see on TV and read about in the newspapers every day. It's not just the power but the destine for their victims, whom they feel are and treat like dirt or even worse, that leads those like ""John Wayne"" Archer to act they way that they do: Not in meeting out justice but in satisfying their own deep and dark feeling and emotions about how their brand of justice should be carried out against those that they feel so justly deserves it!"
