" A huge missed opportunity
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,4,"While Cars 2 still holds the crown for being the studios worst film, this is easily the most barren. That's not to say it's awful, as the visuals are beautiful and almost eerily lifelike, the voice acting is superb, the animation, itself, is very smooth, the characters are pretty cute, and the films message is good. It's got a lot to like about. However, there are a few things that kind of ruin the film for me. For one, the story. It's what you would get if you took the story from ""The Lion King"" and mixed it with some aspects of ""A Bugs Life"", as it's not entirely original or that fresh in terms of writing-even with some decent characters. Speaking of which, the writing is basic and predictable, as you pretty much know what's going to happen just by watching the first part of the film (being vague to avoid spoilers). While that, in and of itself, wouldn't ruin the movie entirely, what does is the PACING. For a movie that is already pretty unoriginal, the fact that it can be a drag with not a lot happening makes the film not that fun. The worst part, however, is the missed opportunity. The film's whole premise is how dinosaurs would be had they not went extinct, and the fact that the film does little to nothing with it other than having the animals talk and humans act like dogs is honestly kind of baffling. What's even the point of having such a cool premise if so little is done with it? What a letdown. Overall, this film is absolutely beautiful and has a few moments, but it's, as stated beforehand, barren-not only of originality, but of soul at times. While it's more competently made and put together than the stupid ""Cars 2"", this is still one dinosaur that focused so hard on looking beautiful, that it forgot to be good."
" Half Great / Half Horrible
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,5,This movie was okay. Some heartwarming lovable moments. Some shockingly violent moments. Would love to know what the pre-release focus groups said about this one. I would have recommended quite a few changes.
" Good Movie, but For Younger Audiences
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,7,"For my animated film, I chose to watch The Good Dinosaur, a 2015 computer-animated Disney-Pixar movie. The asteroid that was supposed to destroy Earth passes by and dinosaurs thrive millions of years later. Arlo, a timid dinosaur, has a trouble making his ""mark"" on the silo which his entire family has marked. He traps a caveboy but then lets him escape because he feels bad, so his dad leads him to try to find the caveboy. In a storm, Arlo's dad is swept away by a river and he is left alone. Arlo adventures through the jungle, finds the caveboy and names him Spot, then eventually travels all the way back home to be reunited with his family.Overall, I thought that the computer animation and voice over was incredible. For example, the opening scene displayed a beautiful pan of the landscape where the dinosaurs lived. It showed the river running over a bed of rocks and a field with tall grass. Here at the start of the movie, I was surprised and thought for a second that I was looking at a real field. Furthermore, the voices for each of the characters was very well chosen. Arlo's voice fits his timid character while his mother's voice is calm and mature as is her character.I would rate this movie a 7 out of 10. I thought that the story was quite average for a Disney-Pixar movie. The main character loses his father and has to overcome his fears to come out on the other end...pretty basic. But overall, I was impressed by the animation and how realistic it looked. I enjoyed watching the movie, and I was still entertained despite a somewhat simple plot. I heard that a few people cried during the movie, so I was expecting to as well because I'm usually an emotional viewer. Sadly, I never felt moved to tears."
" Beautiful and heartwarming
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,7,"My husband and I just watched this knowing nothing about it beforehand, and found it to be a genuinely ""nice"" film. The animation is gorgeous and pushes Pixar's incredible capabilities even further. The dinosaur seemed to be a deliberate contrast to the realistic scenery, to remind us we were watching an animation. The theme is gentle and takes me back to the innocent Disney of my childhood. There are some obvious similarities to other Disney films in there, but this didn't stop us enjoying watching it. I like how they flipped it so the dinosaur was the 'human' role and the human took on a different role too. There are some real talking points and genuine messages for children, and all of us, about love, friendship, kindness and overcoming your fears, and they are put across with emotion. There are darker scenes but they're no scarier than some in Dumbo that scared me as a child (but not enough to not want to watch Dumbo again). Almost all Disney films have darker, scarier parts, and overcoming them is part of the story journey. Those people panning this hysterically overreacting because nature isn't all ice cream and cotton candy. They need to unwrap that cotton wool from around their children and stop turning them into little snowflakes. (These are the same parents who, I imagine, won't let their kid pick up a sweet they dropped and eat it anyway because ""germs""ðŸ˜±).A nice, innocent, touching film, which I couldn't say about the over-the-top-ness of Inside Out."
" A lovely story!
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,9,"It might not be one of Pixar's greatest films but when you're comparing it to Toy Story etc then not many films are. The Good Dinosaur however is a beautiful film, great theme throughout about a dinosaur learning who he is. My son absolutely loves this film and we watch it 3 or 4 times a week. Even though we are nearly word perfect, we all still love watching it!!!"
" Dreadful
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,2,"This is Pixar's biggest dudArlo is whiny, complains all the time and is a dreadful friend to everyone he encountersIt is absolutely not worth wasting your time onThe guy who directed this film - it was his first with Pixar and his last. That should tell you all you need to know"
" Its just the lion king
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,6,"In my opinion the movie would have been much better if the dad had not have died, it was unnecessary to kill the father when there were so many other ways to come out with the same outcome. Also if he had still been alive the family reunion would have made a much interesting impact and really done what the movie set out to do."
" a couple of different decisions away from being magical
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,7,"This has flashes of the Pixar magic but a couple of big decisions work against the film. First the designs of the characters stands at odds with the backgrounds. The environments are all rendered in photoreal that takes few, if any, liberties with nature. However, the character designs are cartoony. Neither the backgrounds or the characters are bad in themselves but combined they create a tonal clash. Second, Spot (the human character) should not have been played as a dog. The idea is funny for a bit but it wears out its welcome fast. It also robs the friendship at the heart of the film of power. Spot is too goofy to carry the pathos required.It is really a shame that those two decisions were made because I like much of the film. The plot is sparse-it conforms to a survival western-to the point that it is really easy to get lost in the vistas. The casting is spot on-Sam Elliot as grizzled T-Rex for example. Best of all the father/son story really works. Alas the film has its issues."
" Underrated film
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,8,"I absolutely love this film, and it definitely gets me in the feels. It's a great story as has good life lessons. According to many reviewers this is a forgettable Pixar film because its didn't live up to Pixar's best money makers, and I completely disagree. This is perfect family film for snuggly couch time!"
" The Good Dinosaur
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,2,"The Good Dinosaur wasn't Pixar's most memorable, nor original flick, but it still somewhat had that Pixar charm to it. The Good Dinosaur had some real behind the scenes drama, with the constant flip flopping of the director, and many rewrites of the script. After all the smoke cleared, Peter Sohn took on the directing, and screenwriting job, putting out a mediocre AT BEST, family oriented film. The film was originated by Peter Sohn himself, Bob Peterson, Meg LaFavue, Kelsey Mann, Enrico Casarosa, & Erik Benson, so clearly you can see there was a lot of discrepancies in the script. The Good Dinosaur had a below par story line, that touched up on a few emotional notes, while adding bland messages throughout.Overall, this was not one of my favorite films of the Pixar group; it's pretty even with Cars 2, being pretty forgettable and boring."
" Pixar for the youngest
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,8,"This is the prove, that Pixar makes the best animated films for all ages. My two sons, age 3 and 6, loves The Good Dinosaur. It's not my favorite, but that doesn't matter!"
" the GREAT dinosaur!
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,10,"The Good Dinosaur has the most beautiful 3D animation pre Lion King 2019, a compelling storyline, and dynamic characters."
" Fantastic film
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,10,One of pixars best films in my opinion such a lovely message great film for shy unconfident children.
" Unadulterated & Underrated. A great film.
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,9,"""Not Pixar's best"" is what most reviews say. I beg to differ. This is a great film even by Pixar's standards. It's a beautiful film visually & storywise.It's a coming of age film, the one actually you want your kids to see, especially if your kid is an introvert or has a shy personality.It's such a heartwarming movie in the typical Pixar way. In fact it's more pure than the creator's previous work; Inside Out, which was a stellar film.The crux of the story is how the shy Dinosaur overcomes his fear & insecurity. Unlike most Pixar movies this has a lot of additional characters that has weightage.Unlike many Pixar movies this one has a lot of Southern characters, maybe that's why the ratings are unjustifiably low! This movie is all about family values, friendship, loyalty, hardwork & kindness.The characters are scripted so well. With every 10 minutes the shy dinosaur becomes more daring & mature. At the end what we see is some one who's comfortable in his own skin & his quirky ways & doesn't let fear control him.One of the best Pixar movie. For me top 5 & besides Up & Coco the most heartwarming movie. Certainly the most visually stunning movie Pixar ever made.A must watch, which deserves an 8.5 rating."
" Pixar Continues To Tug at Heartstrings. Don't Get the Bad Reviews AT ALL.
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,10,"Pixar Continues To Tug at Heartstrings. Don't Get the Bad Reviews AT ALL.I'm in my twenties and to be honest, I still enjoy watching Pixar films with my family. There's just something so genuine and beautiful about their movies, not to mention the endless amount of lessons one can learn.When I initially read the reviews about ""The Good Dinosaur"", they were all so bad. It didn't stop me from watching though and I do not regret that decision. This has got to be one of the most heartwarming Pixar films I've ever seen and it tugged at my heartstrings. I was crying throughout the movie especially towards the end.The thing about being an adult, we tend to overthink something so simple. The plot isn't something grand. It's not funny. It's cute. If you're looking for a film like the classic Pixar favorite ""Toy Story"", forget about watching this. It's a really simple storyline that focuses mainly on teaching the importance of family, dealing with fears and overcoming them as well as finding oneself or making your mark in this world. View ""The Good Dinosaur"" with an open mind and just be ready to enjoy the movie without reading too much between the lines. The good thing about Pixar films is that they remind you how wonderful it is to still be a kid at heart. This movie is no exception. In fact, I think this joins the ranks of ""Finding Nemo"",""UP"", and ""Inside Out"". Everyone has a right to their own opinion, but I can't help but wonder why majority just plain dislike this movie.If you're on the fence after reading one too many 1-star reviews, I say go ahead and still watch it. Judge for yourself. Be pure hearted like a kid and try to embrace the beautiful lessons of the film. Allow it to engulf you and touch you. If you have a kid/kids, this would be one of those perfect films to have a hearty conversation with afterwards. It's very inspiring, really.Give ""The Good Dinosaur"" a try. Oh and one more thing, don't be afraid to cry while watching this. I've seen this twice and still end up a mess every time."
" I loved it
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,10,I really enjoyed this movie. I saw it in the theaters and twice since then. Good for kids and adults. Made me cry more than once
" Average
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,5,"After having binge watched Wall-E, Brave and The Bug's life, and being a Pixar fan ever since I watched all the Toy Stories and Coco, this movie is certainly a big average by Pixar standards. It's an ok watch and will definitely not watch it again. Essentially a cowardly dinosaur getting lost in the wild and making his way back home, overcoming his fears on the way. Some of the scenes between Arlo and the little baby (who is super cute by the way) are almost Bollywood like. There is still kind of a story which is always Pixar's strongest point, but in this case there was too much melodrama here and there, when Arlo swims in that heavy flood to rescue critter etc."
" Better than Avengers!!
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,10,"Simply put the movie is not one of the best but the best of the best, creme de la creme. My whole family cried watching it. Don't listen to others who said it is boring and rated the movie down. They just simply don't understand the substance of its storyline."
" Say what you want about this Film, but it's not as bad as Cars 2
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,10,"I do know that this film didn't surpass the box office sales of Inside Out, but I still found the film very enjoyable. I believe it has some real potential to it, and I think it deserves more respect. It definitely has potential to it. The visual effects in the movie are great."
" The Good Dinosaur
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,7,"I kept seeing images for this computer animation from Disney/Pixar, I never saw a trailer or read about it, so I didn't know what to expect, but it was rated very well, I was definitely up for it. Basically, 65 million years ago, in an alternative history, the asteroid that was supposed to collide with the Earth, causing the extinction of the dinosaurs, safely passes the planet. Millions of years later, dinosaurs are the dominant species, and the human race never evolved beyond cavemen. On a farm in the middle of a valley, Apatosaurus corn farmers Henry (Jeffrey Wright) and Ida (Frances McDormand) have three children that hatch from their eggs, Libby (Maleah Nipay-Padilla), Buck (Ryan Teeple) and Arlo (Jack McGraw). As they grow up, the children try to ""make their mark"", to earn a mud-print on the family's corn silo. Grown up Libby and Buck (Marcus Scribner) are successful in carrying out duties and earning their ""mark"", but the timid Arlo (Raymond Ochoa) finds difficulty in farm tasks. Arlo's Poppa tries to give his son a sense of purpose by asking him to guard the silo and setting a trap for the creature stealing from it. Arlo successfully captures a caveboy (Jack Bright), but Arlo cannot bring himself to kill him, and sets him free. Henry is disappointed and takes Arlo with him to track the caveboy, heading into a ravine. Suddenly, a flash flood washes towards them, Arlo is saved, but his father is swept away and killed. Without his father, Arlo shoulders more of the workload. Looking inside the silo, he finds the same caveboy he previously trapped, angered and blaming him for his father's death, he chases him, and at the river hits his head on a stone and is knocked unconscious. Waking up, Arlo finds himself far from home, and tries to survive alone, only to trap him leg under a fallen boulder. The next day, he wakes and finds his leg has been freed, and the caveboy appears with food for him. The caveboy then leads Arlo to a berry tree, where the caveboy fights a large snake, amazing Arlo and impressing the nearby eccentric Forrest Woodbush, a Styracosaurus (Peter Sohn) who wants to keep the boy. The two dinosaurs compete with each other to give the boy a name he will respond to, and Arlo wins, giving him the name ""Spot"". Arlo and Spot bond as Arlo talks about his family, and Spot, though unable to speak, reveals that his own parents are dead. Later, a storm strikes, Arlo is frightened of the thunder and lightning and runs away, losing the riverbank he has been following home. The next morning, Arlo wakes to find Spot at his side. They are noticed by a band of pterodactyls, led by Thunderclap (Steve Zahn). They claim to be rescuing creatures but are savage carnivores. The pterodactyls attempt to attack and catch Arlo and Spot, but they are rescued by Tyrannosaurus siblings Nash (A.J. Buckley) and Ramsey (Anna Paquin) who ward off the villains. The siblings take Arlo and Spot to their father Butch (Sam Elliott), the three of them are looking for herd of longhorns. The group locates the herd, Butch gets the help of Arlo to lure four Velociraptors and rustle the cattle. During the process, Arlo sees the the familiar mountain peaks of his homeland in the distance and leaves with Spot to return home. Along the way, they see an adult feral caveman in the distance, and though Spot shows interest, Arlo dissuades him, and they keep going. As another storm approaches, Thunderclap and the pterodactyls return and attack and carry Spot away. Arlo gets tangled in a bunch of vines, where he has a vision of Henry leading him home. In the vision, Arlo stops following his father, wanting to save Spot, his father is proud and fades away. Arlo escapes the vines, he finds the pterodactyls at the corner of the river, he attacks them. Arlo and Spot together plunge Thunderclap and the pterodactyls into the water, where they are swept helplessly downstream. When another flash flood occurs, Spot falls into the water, but Arlo leaps in to rescue him before they reach a waterfall. Arlo protects Spot as they plummet down the fall and carries him to shore. As they approach Arlo's home, the two again encounter the caveman, and are approached by an entire cave family. With great reluctance, Arlo pushes Spot to join his newfound family, and the two of them share a tearful goodbye. Arlo finally arrives back home to his mother and siblings and makes his mark on the silo between those of his mother and father. This is a much more back-to-basics story, I will agree its not one of the best, but it is charming enough as you follow a dinosaur and his feral young human friend on a journey to return home, with likeable characters, a fantastic use of colour, spot on realistic scenery, and other elements that appeal to children and adults alike, it is a fun and worthwhile computer-animated adventure. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated, and the BAFTA British Academy Children's Award for Film. Very good!"
" Beautiful movie
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,10,Really beautiful and heartwarming movie. Especially for family. Good job pixar.
" This is a Very Good Family Movie!
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,9,"I'm really disappointed at all of the negative reviews of this movie. Not every movie should be, or even can be a grand slam for every person.My only suggestion would be that maybe very young children may want to wait a year or two. The movie isn't scary, but there are few scenes that could be a little much for very young kids.Other than that, this is a very entertaining, and very beautiful movie to watch with your children. Please don't listen to the one star reviews. I don't think they'd be happy with any movie."
" Good
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,7,"I do understand why peopol love this movie, it is good, but it has some noticeable flaws.The story it self is heart felt, but it has some prolems. It is predictable and very straight forward. The thing is that the concept is intresting, its just that the execution has it fall off. The story came up as very formulea that makes it predictable. Ut my not be one of Pixar's best tale, but its hard to hate it when its heart is in the right place.Let me start this off by saying, the animation does looks good. The backgrounds are colorful and being more realistic, the character animation is smooth and beautiful, and the textures on the animal's fur, skin, scales and even on the backgrounds look very realstic. But it has one big problem with the visuals, they are not sure what the tune wants to be! Some of the animals looks haily realistic and some like alrlo and spot looks cartoony! Its not helping either that the movie tells us that its an epic tale of a dark adveturer, but most of the designs says its a familly friendly comedy! Regardless of that detail, it is a good looking film.The characters has a very big issue, they are not believeable. And those that are on screen just for ten minutes! Starting with Arlo, his the typicall scared of everything outcast. Then there is Spot: how conceptionly is intresting, but in execution he acrs like a dog for some reason. Then there are the vilains, they want to make sure Arlo is dead. They are not very complex, but they do impose a threat on Arlo and Spot (and they did made the most freaky Pixar villain). The other characters has no enough screentime even though they are intresting. The main once may not deliever a lot, but the others can pass.This is may not be one of Pixar's best, but ut turned out to be good. Its not the best dinosaur movie, if you want to watch a better dinosaur movie, watch the land before time. Pixar fans would think its probably really good, but if you will decide to watch it, I bet you will enjoy."
" LOVE & COURAGE
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,10,The message in this movie resonates with a lot of young people these days! We love this so much that we watch it everyday with my 2 and 4 ur old girls!! Well done Disney!
" Solid movie, but doesn't resonate in the same way most Pixar movies do
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,6,"The Good Dinosaur is a good film that hits almost all the right notes, but just doesn't clear the high bar that Pixar has set.The premise of the film is actually quite a clever twist on the caveman, dinosaur stories. It tells an alternate version of history where Dinosaurs learned how to farm and use tools instead of Humans. The humans in the movie actually take more after canines. The movie centers around a family of Brontosaurs farmers, starring the young runt of the family Arlo. Arlo and his human companion, Spot, travel through the prehistoric world trying to get back home and meeting lots of Dinosaurs along the way. While the premise of the film is creative, the story beats do feel generic. The plot follows a very predictable structure and takes a few beats from the Lion King. Following the typical coming of age story isn't a bad thing, but the story lost me a bit after the 1st act. On another note, I do like the theme of nature as a destructive force, working as an antagonist in the film. The dinosaur antagonists of the film did not do much for me though, and don't really have much of a presence.The visuals are pretty great for the most part. There's a lot of big moments in the film, where's there's a breathtaking wide shot of the world with a sweeping score. Pixar's environments look almost lifelike and the highlight of the movie. The visual design of the Dinosaurs feel flat though, they're mono-colored and just don't visually pop out on the screen. They're animated very well of course and move very naturally. I guess that's the problem with going for a more realistic setting and look, but I don't think a little more style and flair would have hurt. It just made the movie feel off, and I think if there were better character designs I would have been more invested.The music and sound are all great. The score is big and epic and always sells the moment, although the songs aren't really memorable outside of the movie. The voice acting is also great, although you don't hear it that much. A lot of the movie is told visually, so the score does a lot of the heavy lifting as far as conveying emotion and thoughts.Overall the Good Dinosaur is a solid movie that entertained, but I would say one of Pixar's weaker films. This movie would probably do really well with kids, and fans of Pixar should definitely watch it as well. Fun and creative concept, but it lacks on a few elements that would have made for a good follow though."
" Such a lovely film!!!
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,10,"Had to write a review as we as a family loved this film! It was so sweet and heartwarming, I was in tears by the end! Much to my children's concern! Highly recommend if you're looking for a thoughtful sweet film."
" Who is the intended audience?
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,5,"Honestly though the plot is sort of all over the place and feels almost pointless. This movie tries to bring up the theme of conquering fear, but there is an awful lot of depression here. With the cheesy western t-rexes and awfully predictable story, I can't see much good in this movie besides the animation (of the scenery, not so much the characters). I guess it was cute at times."
" Out of Extinction
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,8,"The forgotten Pixar movie. But why? Why did it fall to the wayside? Overshadowed by Inside Out? Yes, and maybe rightfully so. Is it Pixar at their very best? Maybe not. But as a product, it's pretty good. The backgrounds are stunningly photo realistic. The story is touching. It felt like a throwback to The Land Before Time. Surprisingly, it's also part comedy and its hilariously funny. It's on Disney+. Worth discovering."
" Stop giving the reason why u hate this movie as : because its pixar -_-
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,7,"Very unique, at one point it was my most favorite movie in my childhood years and very memorable indeed. Meaningful theme/plot:)"
" A heartwarming tale
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,7,"The Good Dinosaur follows the exploits of Arlo as he tries to get home while accompanied by a young human. While it isn't exactly in the top tier of Pixar films, it is still and interesting and heartwarming journey that fans of Pixar's work should enjoy"

",2020-06-18 00:00:00,10,"I can't believe I haven't watched this sooner! We enjoyed this very much, I watched with my 3 year old and 11 year old girls. Both did not find it scary as others have said, they laughed and they got emotional at parts and at the end even my littlest totally got the meaning behind it-but I'll not spoil that. Not a bored moment whatsoever and I hope pixar do more like this and ignore the ridiculous negative reviews. Highly recommended to give it a watch and just enjoy it for what it is. Yes, it's a little different but it's such a precious, emotional yet also very fun story to watch. All you could want in a family movie."

" Underrated Pixar Movie
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,8,The more I've watched it with the kids the more I've liked it. Its an amazing animated movie VS Most.
" The Average Dinosaur
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,5,"Probably one of Pixar's weakest films. There is a good core of character development and living up to his family's expectations, but other than that, there wasn't much to this film. There are a lot of impressive set pieces but I never found them to be very substantial."
" One of the most underrated films
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie in the cinema when it first came out and absolutely loved it, but having seen all the bad reviews I decided to re-watch it 5 years later to find out if it actually was a terrible movie that my young brain was just too immature to fully comprehend. I loved it just as much this time around, if not more, with its stunningly realistic scenes, heartwarming friendships and cute comedy. I understand that it isn't up there with the classic Pixar creations like Toy Story or Monsters Inc, but it's still a pretty decent film, so I don't understand why there are so many poor reviews."
" Unnecessary. Even if you're a Pixar fan.
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,3,This movie should have stayed in the slush pile and been saved for a studio that cared to explore the potential relations humans and dinosaurs could have developed. From beginning to end this was a paint-by-numbers movie with no surprises and nothing to learn from it. Even in 2015 Pixar was far better than this movie.
" Superb
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie. It's tough and it's rough. But so is the environment and the landscape, the dinosaurs, the animals, and the ""critters"".
The colors are muted and more earth tones. Like the Mountains and the river.
The animation is different than any movie Pixar has done before. However it's beautiful and it is true.
I don't feel it's ""fair"" to this movie or any other movie to compare how good one is over another. Apples and oranges.
I love the relationship between Spot and Arlo. I love how Arlo grew in his inner strength and bravery through his journey home.
I love the relationship with the T-Rex family (?!?!) and how the older one taught him about working through fear. I love the message of the movie, that fear and anxiety does not need to cripple you. You can be afraid and still do brave things.
My kids love this movie. I love this movie. I recommend it to everyone. Watch it again or for the first time."
" The good dinosaur
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,9,"This film tells the story of a cowardly young dinosaur, who lost his way home after a storm. He befriends a young human being in prehistoric times. They navigate the treacherous lands in search of their respective homes.The visuals in the film are quite stunning. The colours are vivid and bright, while the backdrop is always beautiful and at times even breathtaking. It's interesting to see a talking dinosaur, while the young human being behaves more like a dog, which is further reinforced by the name spot. I enjoyed the exciting and on occasion dangerous adventure they share together. It's an inspiring story to help children and adults find courage to conquer difficult times."
" Glad the Meteor Didn't Strike
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,8,"Each time I watch this movie I find another small flaw. That being said, the number of small mistakes do not eclipse the good parts of this movie by any means. The little mistakes in logic or character trait are outweighed by stunning visual detail, a compelling and emotional storyline, and a classic tale of advancing from boy to man. (Or rather, dinosaur-boy to dina-man).In this world, the meteor never struck the earth, and as such dinosaurs never went extinct but instead evolved, as one does. Argo, youngest and weakest of his siblings, is swept away from home and forms ties with Spot, the primitive human boy. Spot and Arlo make their way back to Arlo's family farm in a classic western frontier style: facing cattle rustlers, scavengers, and the dangerous unforgiving elements. What makes this more than just a fluffy cute buddy adventure is the dynamic between Spot and Arlo. Spot plays the role of a dog, in essence, as in this timeline humans are not evolved to the point of language and are generally still hunter-gatherers. The two cannot communicate in words, and so the meaningful moments between them require actual thought and care into the presentation. Showing emotion is harder than simply expressing it in words, and the fact that this movie manages to achieve this is a huge point in their favor. Aside from the actual content of this movie, the animation is drool-worthy. There are a lot of scenes involving water and light, and each one has such deliciously perfect lighting and physics. Director Peter Sohn clearly put his heart and soul into this project. Originally, Sohn was co-director, but when he became the primary, the story was simplified to what we now see. His decisions to create the movie with quality being prized over quantity/sensationalism gave shape to the old-west feel of the movie. In tandem with Stephen Schaffer (editor), the wheat was separated from the chaff. Schaffer worked on Wall-E, and as such knows how to shape the scenes to pack an emotional punch."
" My Least Favorite Pixar Film (and yes, that does include Brave and Cars 2)
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,5,"Although it is beautifully animated, The Good Dinosaur proves to be nothing more than a bland Pixar Ice Age ripoff, and is quite honestly the worst to come from the animation company yet. The plot and story is quite generic, and even though the runtime only clocks in at about an hour and a half, it can be pretty boring. The film's world seems incredibly dull, and the characters for the most part seem incredibly played out. There are a few characters that are better than most, and prove to be more than average. The film never really earns any laughs, and instead feels far more fit for younger audiences than families all together. It has some good messages, and some good performances from voice actors involved, even if the dialogue and characters themselves are rather thin. In the end, The Good Dinosaur is nothing more than a generic prehistoric attempt from Pixar and the gang, and proves to be nothing more than a bland disappointment.
My Rating: 4.5/10"
" The Good Dinosaur was... well... good
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,5,"In the Good Dinosaur, we follow Arlo, a dinosaur that gets taken away from his home and must find his way home. We see his adventures as he journeys to return back to his family.There is nothing inherently wrong with The Good Dinosaur. It's just the plot is very pretty. Arlo and the ""critter"" he meets manage to make it out of all the opposition they face fairly unscathed and it just feels like it is missing the rawness of Pixar's previous movies.They also don't leave enough time for a relationship to be built up between the boy and the dinosaur. We don't see the need for the loyalty between them. We can assume that the boy has been out in the wild alone for some time, so he doesn't need Arlo to survive. Not the Arlo would be any help to him as he is kind of useless at most things. On top of this, the ending was very predictable. You could call exactly what was going to happen from about 10 minutes in.The final thing that took away from this movie was the choice to make the boy act like a dog. I just didn't understand that. Like monkey I would get, but dog? No.However, the animation in this is incredible. The artists must have spent months on every single blade of grass and sheath of wheat.Overall, it was alright. Nothing to write home about and certainly not Pixar's best."
" Landscapes amazing and important lessons they teach us
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,9,"The landscape rendering was amazing, they use CGI landscapes that are very photorealistic.
The dinosaur family has their own organic garden,Also, if you put attention you found life lessons the power of confronting your fear, as we can see in the movie Arlo was very scared at the beginning then he have the strength to confront his fears.
Arlo has a big heart because his adventure into the unknown for Spot"
" Weak plot but fun to watch with a good message. Perfect for kids.
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,7,This movie was surprisingly good. The little kid spot was very bad ass yet super cute. The triceratops and most other dinosaurs were hilarious . And who would have thought they would have thought they would team up with T- Rex's! Yeah the plot was weak but the movie comes with good message like most Disney and Pixar movies. Great movie to watch with your kids.
" Not Pixars Best
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,6,"The film has a strong storyline, but it's not a great Pixar film. The voice cast is slightly off and the overall tone is mixed. The production of this film is more interesting compared to the final product. This must have been an epic mess, if this is the end product. Pixar seemed invincible for decades and they hit a tough patch with the Cars era. It's interesting Pixar had two films the year this was released, and this did poorly of the two. The sense of fun is missing and this is just a rate miss for the studio."
" The good, but not great, dinosaur
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,7,"The animation in this movie was beautifully done and super detailed. I can only imagine how many man-hours it took to create every little speck of dirt, every drop of rain, and every little pebble. The backgrounds and nature aspect look super realistic. However, the animation is really the only highlight of this movie. As for the plot, it's nothing special. It doesn't really have that Pixar charm. I feel like any other studio could have made this. ""Inside Out"", ""The Incredibles,"" and ""Finding Nemo"" all had original stories that no one had thought of before. Those movies were absolute genius. They all had a certain ""Wow!"" factor that no other animation studio could top. Here, I feel like Pixar got lazy. It's like they combined the ""getting back to my family"" story of Finding Nemo with the ""prehistoric creature helps human get back to their family"" story of Ice Age. There's even moments that feel copied from ""The Lion King."" Apparently, the script went through several changes, and the director changed as well, and it shows. There were 1 or 2 funny lines, but they weren't enough to save it from lazy writing. It also had the one thing I thought I'd never see in a Pixar movie is here: a drug reference. Yep, you read that right. A drug reference. That seems kind of low for you, Pixar. I'd expect that from Dreamworks, but not you. I would definitely not nominate this for Best Animated Feature. It's a good movie, but nothing special.
Grade: C 7/10. 3.5/5 stars"
" Boring and annoying
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,3,"I've been marathoning Pixar films and this is the first one I created a review of because this film is just that special. The plot is as generic as it gets which was shocking since Inside Out came out the same year and is one of the most creative kid's films ever. Really makes me think the b team was working on this. I would have to say Arlo is easily the worst protagonist in any Pixar film to date. His voice and yelling every 10 seconds was really annoying. Also his only character trait is that he's a coward which is established in the first 5 minutes but they spend every scene reminding you he's a coward until the climax. Take a guess what his character arc is? I wanted to shut it off when Arlo was no joke running away from a tiny bird. The image of our hero, a 10-15 foot dinosaur, running away from a 6 inch bird was so embarrassing and served no purpose that any other movie I would shut it off. But since I'm marathoning them I just muted my tv and watched with subtitles just to make it to the end and got just as much out of it. Actually I got more out of it since Arlo's voice and yelling wasn't making the experience unbearable. Also there's almost no visual comedy or jokes about humans and dinosaurs coexisting. The only thing they do is show that Arlo's family has a farm with a silo, animal pen, and house. They show how they tend to the farm using their nose to till the ground and spitting to irrigate the crop but it isn't shown comedically. Its presented as boring as it would be in real life. Outside this farm, the rest of the world is shown to be undomesticated so what makes Arlo's family so special? Or why even have it when they could just be in a big herd? I have nothing else to say since Arlo's journey home is just filler until the climax when his predictable character arc happens. Overall, too boring and not funny for anyone over 5 and probably too boring and scary for those under 5. Not the worst Pixar film, Cars 2 has that honor, but a pretty shocking film to come after the success of Inside Out."
" Wanted to like it so bad
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,1,"I tried so hard to give this movie a chance and I normally can finish weird/bad movies, but this was so awful I just couldn't. I literally created an account to post my first review. That's how awful this movie is."
" Cute little piece of entertainment
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,6,"The Good Dinosaur is the story of Arlo, a herbivore dinosaur, who gets pulled far from his home by a storm flood. As he travels back towards home, he's joined by a young human boy, who he names Spot. You see, in this movie dinosaurs are the dominant lifeforms, and humans are more akin to wolves or something along those lines.So it's basically a ""boy and his dog"" story, but with dinosaurs and human animals. And sure, that could work. That does work. To a certain point. While I do like Arlo and Spot as characters - Spot especially - it cannot be denied that they're very clichÃ©d and not much is done with them beyond what you'd expect.The world of dinosaurs is also odd and filled with discrepancies. Like there are these T-Rexes, who are supposed to be cowboys and they talk about riding out and such. You know, typical cowboy stuff. Except there are no horses... So why are they talking about riding? It makes no sense. Stuff like that.I also really hate the whole ""making your mark"" plot point the movie sets up. It's such a forced metaphor and it serves no need for the story. We could reach the same emotional impact without it being shoved down our throats.That being said, the movie looks ridiculously good. Especially the backgrounds. I mean, they're downright photo-realistic. Pixar must have cheated and simply sent a crew to film in Yellowstone. That's the only explanation. Filthy cheaters, the lot of them.The Good Dinosaur is by far not the best effort we've seen from Pixar, but it's a cute, inoffensive little tale about a young boy learning to stand on his own four feet. I can dig it."
" The Good waste of Time
",2020-02-28 00:00:00,2,"There is nothing original anymore. This movie was an annoying version of Land Before Time. Surprisingly, the more character development there is, the more apathetic you grow to the protagonist. If my kids don't give it the time of day, then it's a flop."
" A solid family film despite its minor faults
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,8,"I'm a big dinosaur nerd, so I'm probably rating this 1 star higher than it deserves, but even though it isn't Disney/Pixar's most powerful film, it's certainly worth watching.The story is a good one, but it would feel all too familiar if it weren't for the film's unique alternate dimension. It's very interesting to think that, without the mass extinction, the dinosaurs might be more mentally advanced than humans. This made the dinosaurs remarkably human, and the animalistic human was a hilarious and charming treat. Despite the new take, the story is too well-worn to evoke a profound emotional response, which settles the story as a good one rather than great.The non-character animation was breathtaking. Water, dirt, tree bark, and other such details were unbelievably intricate. At first, I wondered if Pixar would continue this trend of astoundingly realistic animation, but I quickly realized why they usually stay away from it. Realistic animals are not easily capable of drawing emotional attachment from an audience, so the cartoonish style is preferred for many of Disney/Pixar's stories. However, the cartoon dinosaurs stood out distractingly from the nearly tangible background. Not to worry, it wasn't a constant distraction because I quickly adjusted to the style as the story began, and I was seriously impressed to see Pixar flexing their animation prowess."
" Terrible Pixar.
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,1,"It would have been much better if Arlo drown. He's whiney and annoying. If he had listened to his bumpkin father instead of whimpering, everyone would be ok. But no, he's a wiener."
" Awful
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,2,"Honestly, this is worst Pixar movie and Cars 2 ain't even close. A total rip off of The Lion King, they even used the same sequences and not only the story... Animation is so ugly, it looks worse than early 2000's animation. The story in uninteresting and my sister and I laughed all the time at that silly dialogue. No wonder no one watched this one."
" It features some real touching scenes
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,8,"I was fairly surprised by how much I enjoyed the 'The Good Dinosaur'.It features some real touching scenes, which were helped by the solid voice cast and strong animation from the Pixar team.I do have a few grievances, I felt the film copied a few things from other productions. One being the way Poppa Henry went out, while Spot was basically Donnie from 'The Wild Thornberrys'."
" Animated Masterpiece
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,10,Loveable monsters of the prehistoric age that compels us to begin to think a sequel would be embraced with as much enthusiasm. A Film that will be enjoyed by all ages. Get this film that your movie library be proud to own for ages.
" Those indifferent to animated movies should give it a look
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,9,"A devastatingly powerful movie about a pair of characters divided not only by race but by language learning to see themselves in each other. The narrative loses nothing from the human character being unable to express himself in a language intelligible to us, but it only gives us a chance to see a fresh type of visual story telling and communication.With all the other charms it's studio usually gives, there will indeed be a loyal fanbase who will watch this movie as a matter of course.But if you are one of these people that has never really swooned for pixar as much as kids and college students like me did, this is one of the special ones."
" The Mediocre Dinosaur
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,6,"Beautiful animation and a weird but boring, predictable journey. Even in accepting a world where dinosaurs talk, and live at the same time as early human species, it still seemed odd that the Neanderthals mostly walked about on all fours, and that their sense of smell was so sensitive. And some animals are the bad guys for eating meat, but some aren't, just because. Maybe it needed some musical numbers or something. I dunno. Not bad, but not The Good Dinosaur, either."
" Worst. Pixar. Ever.
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,5,"Completely boring, pointless movie. I don't understand why some people love this movie. Very weak animated movie."
" Great pixar film. Shame about the ignorant reviews
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,10,Pixar quality all over. Some sad reviews from uneducated parents. It's 2019 not 1940!
" Surprisingly bad for Pixar
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,1,"I think the reason this movie doesn't work is that it is VERY very preachy, and forgets the whole point of childhood is to first: have fun! The Pixar films that have fun as their central motivating force are the movies that work. This movie begins on the premise that you are not worthy of love unless you jump through the hoops the adults have set in place for you before you were even born. A nightmare of a childhood is when you are constantly told you must earn worthiness, instead of just being loved. A rather horrible film really. I do not recommend it."
" My Daughter Loves It!!!
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,7,I have been forced to watch this movie at least 20 times - probably much more! It's playing whilst I write this. It's really not bad at all as far as modern animations go. At least there's no dinosaurs with IPads or rapping raptors!!!
" Very good
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,7,"O Bom Dinossauro Reminded me of the movie Emoji The Movie! Arlo is a misfit dinosaur trying to show his family does not need to be ""chosen"" just be himself and friendship with this boy brings a great teaching I really enjoyed the movie 8.0 very good.Movie watched on February 5, 2019"
" The Just-Sort've-Ok Dinosaur
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,6,"Pixar kind've shot itself in the foot with The Good Dinosaur. They have such an amazing track record of incredible animated films that they've really raised the bar on themselves. The Good Dinosaur while visually stunning is a bit bland in the story department. It isn't bad or anything, it's just remarkably unremarkable. Which, by Pixar standards, is a failure.Still, a meh Pixar movie is a decent experience and while I don't put this one particularly high on the Pixar list, it's worth watching, even if just for the animation."
" Quite good
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,6,"Even Pixar has made masterpieces this one is not the best,somehow has a touching plot and two lovable characters that help.For younger audience."
" It's fine
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,7,"It's a cute movie with wonderful animation. Its biggest flaw is that it's uninteresting, but not enough to be ""bad."" If you're a Pixar fan, it's worth watching once. I wouldn't give it much credit beyond that.To anyone who says this movie is too scary and not suited for children, y'all clearly didn't grow up watching things like The Dark Crystal, and you gotta put on your big kid panties."
" Not Pixar's best
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,6,Even though I say this isn't Pixar's best it's still worth watching. It had it's sad moments and it's cute moments that they do so well with at Pixar. It just didn't stand out in the crowd and had little dialogue when it was the dinasour and the little child off on their own for a while. You can see why it didn't get as much of a following as some of their other films but it's still really well made and worth a shot.
" Emotional
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,10,I literally cried the whole way through this movie! Definitely a hidden/under rated gem!
" Worth it but not amazing
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,7,"It was cute, it was touching, it had funny parts. The plot was pretty simple and straight forward.However there wasnt a whole lot to it. And most of all it set it up for a big happy ending. Like you expect to see everyone you met, or at least the humans, to move in next door. But the ending that actually happens is a big let down. I know theres a sequel and perhaps they made this one expecting a sequel but standing on it's own it's good but not great."
" Great Movie
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,9,"The Good Dinosaur was a movie I thought was fantastic, hear-warming, and well developed. This movie had a great story line that interested me right from the beginning. The topic of family and different relationships was something that I could connect to. I immediately became connected and emotional about the characters in this movie. The good dinosaur made me feel good but also created many other emotions throughout the movie. The adventure Arlo, the dinosaur, took in order to get back to his family was heart-warming, exciting, and emotional. I loved each character's different and diverse personalities. It was fun learning about each new character that came into the picture throughout the movie and each one of them created some type of emotion in me when they were on screen. I became emotionally invested in the movie and the storyline sucked me in. I found myself repeatedly rooting for Arlo, the lost dinosaur. This movie filled me with emotion and drew me in, kept me genuinely entertained the entire time."

" Pure cinema.
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,9,By far one of Pixar's best. Beautiful in every way. You can watch this a hundred times and never be bored. Unlike their usual drivel this film isn't heavy with wall to wall talking and features no ugly humans.
" Certainly not the incredible dinosaur.
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,6,"Inside Out was an amazing film and a tough act to follow even for Pixar whose films almost non-stop were instant classics with a few exceptions like Cars and its sequels, Brave and to a certain extent A Bug's Life. But this is also the lowest grossing of their works to date with only 332 mio. dollars globally.Not that the film is terrible, because it has its strong elements like the gorgeous background animation which shows a grand scale and photorealistic landscapes even if it's not anything special for a dinosaur movie. But that sadly leads us into one of the odd choices of the movie, because the cartoony style characters feel rather misplaced in these realistic surroundings and that works against itself.And sadly, that's not the only problem, because the studio that sparked our imagination with what toys could do when we didn't watch or what could be behind monsters hiding in closets set up this intruiging premise for this film about what the world would look like if they hadn't gone extinct, but spent so little time on it and gave a rather predictable coming-of-age story.Arlo is a dinosaur kid who is filled with fear and can't do what it takes to make his family proud, but one day he discovers a cave boy who ends up turning his life upside down when he gets seperated from his family and must survive on his way home. The bond they build is the strongest part of the movie, because of their similar goals and watching them travel together. They meet a colourful cast of characters who, yet again, are not given much screen time to be more than either an obstacle or a helper. That's sad, because they could hev been really entertaining or even more in the rather by-the-book story.Yes, this is not a ""Pixar-good"" film, but okay for casual viewing."
" Poppa
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,1,"Stupid and bad ending,poppa should'nt die,just let him return alive at the end of the story and reunite with the dino family,this movie sucks and make my child sad bcoz poppa die"
" Balled my eyes out
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,7,"I don't often write reviews on IMDB films, but after seeing this film rated as a 6/10, I felt I had to. I have never cried at a movie before, I often feel sad and heart warmed at certain films, but this movie made me ball my eyes out.A storyline so simplistic, yet so beautiful. The animation would spot on, the characters facial expressions amazing and the connection between the main two was on point.I wouldn't particular deem this a young child suitable fin due to the 'drug hint' and aggressiveness towards animals, but I loved it as an adult.Don't believe everyone else's opinion."
" Beautiful movie... Loved it!
",2019-08-20 00:00:00,10,This is one of the must haves at home for kids. I am a 27yo adult stilll enjoyed this through and through. Beautiful story... Beautiful music... This really is one of the best animated pieces by Pixar. Only a few movies move me enough to write a review.
" Great little film for kids
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,8,"My 4 year old twins loved this movie. It was simple, and had a lovely string storyline. Very good to teach young ones about loss, and family."
" Underrated
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,8,"This movie is definitely underrated. It's incredibly unassuming, but it's beautiful. The animation and music is outstanding. The story simple and sweet. My 2.5 year old son is obsessed with this movie, because duh, dinosaurs are cool! He handles the ""scary"" parts just fine."
" A Good Cry at the end
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,9,"This is probably one of the only Pixar films that I had never seen. It wasn't very promoted film and I can see why it isn't one of the popular ones. The Good Dinosaur is a film about a family of Brontosauruses that have 3 kids. Out of the three baby dinos, one of them is a little small and slow. He can't compete with his brother and sister in achieving greatness.
He gets lost when he flows down the river. As he tries to find his way home, he meets and friends a cave baby, who is out on his home. The two of them head toward home and the story is about their journey home. Its a happy, funny, and sad film that is exactly what Pixar is about, but there is so much down time that I can see where kids would lose interest. I enjoyed it very much and had a good cry at the end."
" Doesn't Deserve the Hate!
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,8,"Because this movie has always had such negative reviews, I avoided it like the plague. But I should know by now not to do that, because I did the same thing with Brother Bear and that's one of my favourite animated movies ever. Ok, to say The Good Dinosaur is also one of my favourites is a bit of a stretch - but I can tell you that it truly is a beautiful movie. The animation is PERFECT; oh wow, it is so gorgeous. Probably the most visually stunning Pixar movie. I don't think the plot is too slow, and I don't think it drags on - rather, I think it's just very simple. Simple does not equal bad. Also, and this is an important one, I relate to Arlo in many ways. I'm sure I'm not the only one, either. It's great to see a main character who genuinely struggles with self-confidence and anxiety and not being able to do anything right. The relationship between Arlo and Spot is adorable too. Spot is such an amazing, underrated character. I love him.I can't believe it took me four years to finally get around to seeing this. But even more than that, I can't believe how much criticism it gets! I wasn't expecting to like this, in fact I actually wanted to hate it. But it was the opposite. I found it so endearing and so emotional. I was sobbing by the end of it. This only proves, once again, that just because majority of a movie's reviews are bad does NOT mean it IS bad. It means all opinions are subjective, and at the end of the day that's what reviews come down to. So I highly recommend this to anyone who loves simple but beautiful stories."
" Nice for all
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,10,I loved it and my two-years old son just loved it as well. He wants to watch it over and over again. lovely story about friendship with some very sad moments and Pixar high quality. Good combination.
" A Dino and boy get stoned together?!
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,1,Like for real?! It was already an awful story line... but then the Dino and the human get high together?! Are you kidding me.
" It would have been better as a entirely different movie
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,3,"I was trying to think through why this movie failed, and I think it comes down more to a worldview issue, and less about a storytelling or an animation issue. The plot was written as a fairly straight-forward western, and the scenery animations were fantastic, so good in fact that it made the characters seem like they didn't fully belong in their own world. But even with all the animation quirks, I really think the film would have been alright, if not for the saddening worldview that is very obvious throughout the whole movie.It seemed like the writers all came into this film with this depressing premise, that ""humans are not innately special."" What a disheartening idea, and I think that the struggle of dealing with that depressing worldview sunk the movie down.As a strict concept, a movie in which the ""people"" are dinosaurs and the actual people are wolves, might sound revolutionary, or it might sound like some fun thing to try out; but in actuality, when you see it for 90 minutes, it's harsh. There is something special about the human species, and I think deep down, most people would agree with that, and so to see humans depicted as dogs just seems fake and really unnerving. Which makes the film very difficult to sit through, if you believe humans are innately special. Though, I guess, if you don't think that, then you'd have a better chance of liking the movie.All in all, if the writers would have made this a story about a human boy, who had a pet dinosaur, I think it would have been tremendously better. It could have still had the western themes. It could have been just as gritty, and ""big kiddish"" as this movie was, but it would have been better, because I think very few people really want to see a human depicted as less than fully-human.I give the movie a 3 because of the animation, but the themes make it too sad, and disturbing for young kids, and the human-dog is just unnatural. Not Pixar's best, and I'm a huge Pixar fan myself, so that means something."
" Good indeed
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,10,Don't let the goofy character animation fool you as the movie is filled with emotion and action.
" Umm... real dinosaurs had feathers
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,4,"This movie is sadly the lowest point of all the Pixar movies. Of course it is not poorly made at all considering it is Pixar, however the actual contents lacks. Our main character is not likeable and the voice acting doesn't help. He evolves over time but stays boring and lame until the credits roll. It is an adventure film so characters met asking the way are interesting but really add little to the story. It tries to be heartwarming and meaningful while having a slow and pointless trek through this alternate world."
" Was I the only one screamed in the scene a big insect appeared?
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,5,"Although I was annoyed with coward Arlo, I was touched by his growing up with a boy. The most interesting thing was a scene they ate psychedelic fruits and got high. It was very crazy and funny! I laughed it so much.By the way, all of natural background were CG, right? I couldn't believe it... That's really Amazing!"
" The good dinosaur
",2019-06-01 00:00:00,10,"I sat down to watch ""The Good Dinosaur"" with my family, that being wife and 6 year old son, and I didn't really have any idea that I would end up being as entertained by this animated movie as I was. I had thought that this would just be another one of those mass-produced generic animated movies aiming for the kids.The story in ""The Good Dinosaur"" was actually surprisingly good, and it was told in a very entertaining way, and also in a way that kept the movie progressing at a constant good pace. There weren't really any dull moments throughout the course of the movie, and even the slower moments in the movie were good and had crucial parts to the overall storyline.The CGI, style and textures in ""The Good Dinosaur"" were all very impressive. But of course, Pixar is well-known for that, and they didn't disappoint by any means with this 2015 release. The entire animated world was rich in color, details and very lovable.As for the characters portrayed in ""The Good Dinosaur"", well there is something for everyone here. I dare say that much. Of course you have someone brave, someone lovable, someone daring, someone clumsy, etc. etc. It was all here. And they had managed to get together and impressive group of voice actors and actresses for the various roles. And for an animated movie, then the voice acting is essential.""The Good Dinosaur"" is the kind of story that you take to heart immediately and you will be entertained right up to the very end of the movie, that is for sure. And although you already know how the movie will end, it is still a good story to experience and an entertaining movie to watch.This 2015 animated movie, like most Pixar movies, is of the type that you can watch more than just a single time. And it does stand out from many other Pixar movies, mainly because of the setting of the age of dinosaurs and the characters.""The Good Dinosaur"" scores a solid six stars out of ten rating from me, as it is a movie that has that ability to make you feel good, feel entertained and make you laugh all at the same time."
" Fantastic scenery, so-so characters.
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,8,"Because ""Jurassic Yellowstone Park"" would have been too confusing of a title, we find ourselves with ""The Good Dinosaur"". I honestly did not expect this to be a western, but that's what we have here: incredibly beautiful scenery, living off the land, and cattle rustlers. Although, to be honest, I would pay to see this exact same movie without the really cartoony-looking characters and just all the amazing scenery they were able to produce with computers.
But seriously, the plot seems tried-and-true, but with the characters reversed (the human is the pet), which is unique in that sense. And, as all Pixar films do, I did find myself as a weeping mess by the end of it."
" A Pixar Film trying too hard to be a Pixar Film
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,6,"The Good Dinosaur is quite mediocre for Pixar standards, however I feel it is also hated a little too much. The character arch for Arlo is compelling and super cool to view, however the story and most of the events in the film can be a little forgettable.
The animation is absolutely gorgeous. This film almost seems like it is just showing off how good they can use animation due to the abundance of nature imagery.
The emotional scenes in this film don't quite hit like previous Pixar films do, and the story overall seems to lack compared to other Pixar films. Although this film is still more on the positive end than the negative end.
Overall, this is a good film for the family, however I'm sure everyone in the family would rather watch Toy Story. I think that sentence just about sums up this entire film. It's like a pixar film trying very hard to be a pixar film."
" It's...Okay
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,3,"It's okay, but it's not really all that good or interesting. It's really boring in some places, weird in others, and in general is just not really worth watching. I wouldn't actively choose to watch it again unless there was just absolutely nothing better out there. Thankfully, there is."
" Simple and cute
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,6,"Is not the best Pixar movie, but also is not the worst, I just thought the events so predictable, but the photography and the soundtrack is great, and the real problem be on the plot, don't have a huge deepening in the characters, is just ok."
" You will never regret watching this Amazing film animation
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,9,"The cartoon is awesome.Fantastic work! I watched this film with my brother that is 5 years old with great pleasure! A cartoon about good and bad, about friendship, about family, about human values. The cartoon makes us think about how we live in our world, once again look around and see the beauty of the world around us, look at ourselves and our actions from the outside. So wonderful, kind, touching, beautiful film has provided us the director, stage-makers, actors, creators, designers and team workers. The good dinosaur movie must be treasured and applauded. I cried and laughed all the hour and a half. I highly recommend this movie for all generations."
" A charming 'lesser' Pixar animation
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,8,"This film takes place in a world where the dinosaurs didn't go extinct sixty five million years ago. It is set around the time of the first Stone Age people and the dinosaurs are farming. The story is centred on Arlo, a nervous young Apatosaurus. He tries to help on the farm but is scared of the chickens he is meant to feed and is weaker than his siblings. After a tragedy strikes, the family struggle somewhat; then as Arlo confronts a 'critter' stealing their corn both of them fall into the river. He finds himself far from home. He gradually befriends the critter, a young boy he later names Spot. On their journey home they will face a variety of perils as well as meet other dinosaurs; some friendly, others dangerous.Having heard some fairly negative reviews I nearly skipped this; I'm glad I didn't. It may not be up there with the best of Pixar's works but it is a charming little story with fun central characters. Spot, a boy who acts more like a dog provides most of the laughs while the viewer sympathises with Arlo and his plight. There are some fairly dark moments that may upset or scare younger children; these don't feel out of place though and add to the excitement for older viewers. The animation was good, as one might expect. At first I was unsure about the contrast between the cartoony characters and the almost photo-realistic high quality backgrounds but as I watched they grew on me... more realistic dinosaurs would have been too scary in some scenes and lower quality backgrounds wouldn't have captured the grandeur of the setting. Overall I found this to be a charming film; it may be considered a 'lesser' Pixar film but to my mind it is still worth watching."
" A rare miss from pixar
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,5,I love most Pixar movies but this one didn't really do it for me. The characters weren't as loveable and relatable as other Pixar movies.
" Most underrated Pixar film
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,9,"I'm literally the only person I know who likes this movie. Apparently my brother and sister in law still don't trust my taste in film after recommending this film. They hated it. So just a note, this film isn't for everyone.However, I think if you're like me, you are the target audience. This film really struck a cord with me because I relate so well with Arlo, the dinosaur. I've never have had confidence in myself in really any aspect. It's something I still struggle with daily.The Good dinosaur features Arlo as the main character who since birth has been the runt of the family and never can seem to do anything right. He has never been able to find something he is good at, or a way to make his mark on the world. That is the struggle for Arlo in this movie, to find a way to make his mark. This describes my struggle almost exactly, so I resonated with the film.The film contains a very simplistic plot. It's nothing really complex. It's simpler than your typical Pixar movie as far as storytelling is concerned. So some may find it boring for that reason, but if you are like me, this film may resonate with you.I should also note that this film has some of the best animation I have seen. They made a stylistic choice to make the characters a bit cartoony, but the background photorealistic. To some, the contrast may be off-putting, but the background is truly a sight to behold."
" Pretty Disappointing for a Disney Pixar Film...
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,5,"Brought to you by the skills and talents that created Toy Story, Finding Nemo and Inside Out is the latest film ""The Good Dinosaur"".Early on we see our main character ""Arlo"" hatch from an egg and begin to enjoy family life with his Father, Mother and two other siblings. As you expect for a Disney film, Arlo stands out from the rest of his family, suffering from fear of the world. His fear slows him down from completing his daily chores that are necessary for the family to survive.One day while Arlo is protecting food on the family farm he sees a small human child (who really acts like a dog) stealing his family's food. Arlo's father decides that enough is enough and decides to challenge Arlo in hopes to try and make him grow as well as also overcome his fears. It is during this something moment that something tragic happens... (Classic Disney)Arlo returns home but shortly afterwards he sees an opportunity to complete the task his father set him.During Arlo's big adventure into the wild there wasn't a single character that I enjoyed and I hoped see again. Every character is forgettable and not memorable, some even being mean and silly. None are funny or show the exciting, fun side which you almost expect to see in Disney films. Other characters included a Rhino, T-Rex's and Pterodactyl's- even with cool animals like these and more I feel all of them are annoying and even painful to watch.To be very honest, this was a Disney movie I really disliked. This Disney title provides outstanding visual and stunning audio details (As if Pixar could ever fail at that) but this film overall is sad and easily forgettable.The film starts off very sad and at some points it feels like the level of sadness keeps building. Alro does team up with a side kick, but when the sidekick is a boy who acts like a angry puppy dog it feels as though there is a lack of depth. With these two Disney characters I feel we are seeing many missed opportunities.Forgive me if I sound harsh, but to be positive there is one stand out scene where our two leads share a fantastic scene communicating about family and their parents (again it's all very sad).By the time the credits rolled I was so curious: how on earth did this film (in 2015) have the final results considering its Pixar? With light googling I discovered this film had many issues during development, including the story writing, casting changes and finance issues. When you watch this film all of these issues feel evident given the end result.The Good Dinosaur overall has all has stunning animation (which always amazes me) & includes a 7.1 HD track which will really let the neighbours know you're home. But the pain in this film is the story and it's characters. To this day I still quote Many Pixar films and long for Nemo 2 & Toy Story.
This film I have forgotten already and there are no characters or quotes worth remembering here.4.8/10

" My 2 years old son watched it 30 times
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,10,"He's a dino fan and chose this one out of 30 Disney movies to watch and all of us loved it.Yes the dark side of the movie is really impacting even me. But I'd like my son to know this world is a cruel world and you should learn to be good to other peers or races. And getting over your fear is much appreciated as well.I guess nowadays people just take a lot of things for granted in cartoon movies. You should go look at the original 3 little pig, a lot of dark hints in those classic cartoons. Today's people is just weak minded and lost all animal instincts. Do some research before going to a movie, if that's not your cup of tea, skip it."
" Props to animators
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,4,"Storyline was uninteresting overall, characters seemed shallow. Not a very creative plot either, just dissapointing.
The animators did a very well job, and seemed to put effort in it. The water especially in this movie looks like it was meticulously crafted. Very smooth."
" Just Bizarre
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,1,"I had genuinely thought I'd be an exception when I heard bad reviews initially. I do sometimes love movies that others pan. I love Disney and Pixar. But no, I too pretty much hated this movie. It's just bizarre and disturbing. And it goes from bad to worse. I don't want to bother picking it apart with millions of specific negatives, just adding a vote for saying it's truly a terrible movie."
" Beautiful animation, mediocre story
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,5,"The animation in The Good Dinosaur is superb. Everything else about this movie is just mediocre. I loved seeing the animated version of Yellowstone and the surrounding area, even if I never quite understood why they chose to feature dinosaurs in this otherwise pretty straightforward Western. I doubt my kids will be clamoring to watch this film again, especially since there are many better Pixar movies available, but it's not bad."
" Could have been!!
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,3,"First off, let me start by saying don't believe all the positive reviews on here!! You need to click on the user name to see if that person does more than one review!! You click on their name & you see they been a member for 1 or more years but only have 1 REVIEW. That means the review is a bogus review!! People that are involved with Hollywood create these fake accounts for the simple reason or hyping a movie or trying to bring a competitors movie down!! So just check the reviewer before considering that review as one you might want to go by!!
That being said, on to the movie. The story and meaning of this movie is good, but that's where the good parts of the movie end!! This is an animated film & a kids film but that does not change things up. Kids learn from movies like these & that's why Disney was once the best in children's entertainment. Once I said but not now!! This shows dinosaurs were very intelligent & humans were dogs!! As we have been told, dinosaurs had pea brains & were not intelligent, being why they went extinct!! This movie has them being the more superior beings on the planet. The humans, as I said before are portrayed as DOGS!! They are even referred to as, critters in this movie!! Why I say dogs, the human boy walks on all fours like a dog!! Uses the bathroom like a dog!! Barks & growls like a dog!! Fetched like a dog!! Sleeps in every way like a dog!! Scratches himself just like a dog!! Even has a name fit for a dog, Spot!!! As we know, humans were not like that!! Aka, we did not evolve from apes or dogs!!! With the human being portrayed like that, tell me how then did he know or have the ability to make and wear a leaf pair of shorts? Then when you finally see other humans, they are standing up right, but still walk like dogs and howl!! They only walk at the end when they get the little boy!! You mean they got some intelligence that fast, wow!!! One more thing, when it rains a good storm, mountain sides full of LIVING trees turn into a landslide in the blink of an eye!! Making the river rise rapidly and form a huge waterfall!! At the other end of that waterfall, the water is CALM, lol!!! I don't recommend this movie for children at all!! Like I said, to story line of forgiving and over coming fears is a good lesson, but that can be told in a proper way!!!"
" The Good Dinosaur tells a poignant prehistoric, yet familiar, tale.
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,7,"Considered by many to be one of Pixar's weakest entries in their illustrious filmography, this family animation may lack narrative memorability but do not let that deter you away. There is a surprising amount of emotion from a story that is mostly told through breathtaking visuals, which should appeal to many. After a tragedy strikes his family, a young dinosaur is swept away by a raging river and loses his mother. Fearful of most things, he must learn to overcome the natural terrors that bask in the foreign environment. The plot is reminiscent of Disney's own 'The Lion King', and does rely heavily on specific details so much that it frequently feels like a weak imitation. An untimely yet heroic demise forces the protagonist to develop and become an adult. We've seen it before. However Pixar is able to overhaul the aesthetics and create an emotionally touching film that is sure to leave many in tears, including my sister who required tissues on two occasions. Dialogue is only spoken from the dinosaurs, given them human characteristics, whereas the primitive cave dwellers resemble wild animals. The small amount of dialogue is voiced decently, especially by Ochoa. This reversal forces the narrative to be told visually for the most part, allowing the majestic landscapes and outstanding animation to be at the forefront. It truly is a stunning picture. One scene in particular, where both Arlo and Spot reveal to each other that they are alone through sticks and sand, was so beautifully told that it made me feel vulnerable. Arlo's journey is emotionally exhausting, and narratively inconsistent with random scenes being stringed together, but remains poignant throughout. It may not be as memorable as Pixar's other excellent additions, yet the refreshing visual storytelling and gorgeous animation ensures that it should not be overlooked. Oh, the score also deserves recognition. Tender, soft and simply exquisite. Just a shame the film was released the same year as 'Inside Out'..."
" Boring, contrived and unsure what it wants to be
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,3,"I'm not a die-hard pixar fanboy, but I will admit that generally, Disney's animated films are pretty entertaining and of good quality. Of course this film is competently made, with amazing visuals in places and is well animated, ect ect, but the plot is downright awful. Mostly nothing really happens, after the dinosaur gets lost, the story follows a similar structure to the first Lord of the Rings novel, a ""and then he met some people who were nice and helped him then he met some more people who were nice and helped him and then he met more people who were nice and helped him"". there wasn't much plot, no real villain that stretched the whole movie, just a dull ""then this happened, then this happened"" structure that gets boring quick. It doesn't seem like a grand learning arc or plot, more like a series of mild inconveniences and minor obstacles that are largely unrelated. You don't get a feel for a big narrative, and the only viewers young enough to have an attention span appropriate for this choppy style of story are too young to see it, it being rated PG.
That brings me on to the issue of the violence. I've seen a lot of reviews saying that its too violent and upsetting, but I would actually argue that its not violent enough, at least for the story it's trying to tell. Its not cartoonish, funny violence, but real, genuine threat, but every time it seems like a villain is actually about to be killed, they are goofily allowed to escape as if it was only a minor battering. This film presented itself as a gritty reality of dinosaur life, but also then teases you with violent moments then backs out of them. It needs to be either less violent, or more violent, because its rides an awkward middle ground, and for a PG movie, it could have gone all out with killing off characters in fight scenes. Either kill the pterodactyls or don't, but its presented in such a strange way it doesn't work at all.
There are also very strange, contrived moments that try and be funny where it doesn't work, like when the dinosaur meets this one that camouflages with the trees and has whackily named sidekicks, this was only so the dino could name his human pet and for no other reason, which could have been done so much quicker and easier in one or two lines of dialogue without needing a whole, weird, unfunny character.
Overall its boring, awkward and unfocused and isn't really worth watching if you only casually enjoy animated movies."
" A beautiful film about growing up
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,8,"One of the strengths in the Pixar canon is their ability to tell stories of facing fear and how this can make you stronger, how being scared isnt a weakness but a chance to grow. This is Pixar at it's most literal in that regard. A simple tale told in gorgeous panoramic chapters about family, friendship and the journey from childhood to young adult. And honestly, as a parent, it's a meditation on the rush we sometimes place on this growth for our own convenience. Heavier themes than some reviews give it credit for, but they are there nonetheless."
" Average movie...
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,5,"""The Good Dinosaur"" is an Animation movie in which we watch a family of dinosaurs which are living side by side with humans trying to collect and store as much food as they can in order to survive in the winter. Every dinosaur of this family wants to put its sign (footprint) on the building that they store their food because in this way it will be an important part of the family. The footprint represents the importance of a dinosaur in the family.I believe that this movie is just another average animation and nothing more, it's not a bad movie but if you want to watch it just don't expect much from it. If you have already watched some of the classic animated movies then you will understand from the first minute of it what it's going to happen and how the plot is going to be. Despite that, I would like to mention that I liked the direction of Peter Sohn's because he made us see from a different perspective some situations and the most important was that even that we are watching an animated movie there was an evolution in the character of the dinosaur (Arlo).To sum up, I have to say that ""The Good Dinosaur"" is an average movie with some good scenes but a boring plot and also bad CGI's. If you are a fan of animated movies and you have already watched some others then there isn't any need for watching this movie. Although if you want to watch it then you should be prepared for it."
" The people giving this one seven stars or less didn't pay attention to the story
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,10,"I have enjoyed many Disney Pixar movies, and this one still stands out. There is a huge moral of the story, if people are willing to actually SEE and HEAR it. Arlo was the runt, never being able to catch up to Libby & Buck. Throughout the movie, there are several points in which Arlo is put to test his ability to overcome obstacles and serious fears. This is about trust, about making a friend who you may not have otherwise. Arlo and Spot are enduring. By the end, they truly care for each other. And we see Arlo finding his voice, his courage, and strength, to follow in his Pappa's big feet. And when I watch my 3 year old granddaughter, this is the movie she asks for first. (Then Frozen, of course).
Watch it with a child's eye. I have seen this about 40 times (seriously) and it still makes me tear up a bit. Besides the absolute beauty of the cinematography, the story is wonderful."
" Released too soon
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,8,"I honestly can't understand how people could rate this movie with 1, 2 or 3 stars only. This isn't Disaster Movie or Superbabies or whatever the lowest rated movies are. And not comparable at all.I believe The Good Dinosaur was released at a bad time as well. Children all over the world are loving dinosaurs right now, I think this movie came out just before the ""dinosaurs are trendy again"" era. Was it released now or in 2017 it would probably have been a bigger hit.
The story is good, no huge surprises just like most other Disney Pixar movies, but it has something for the whole family, young as old. My two sons (2 and 5) love it. I like it too, for the story, the animation, the jokes and the beautiful scenery.My kids dino fans but not old enough to watch the Jurassic Park/World movies. This one is a good dino story for the young ones."
" The Bad Dino.
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,2,"For those who say it's underrated:1) Empty story2) Dull character design (graphically and story-wise)3) The first half of the movie barely have any dialogue (or even interesting)4) Some long silent and uninteresting scenes that doesn't fill the story gaps5) Not fun at all6) Not charming at all7) Spot is the only interesting character in the movie (Arlo is the opposite)8) Some inappropriate scenes (Berry-like drug usage , carnivorous acts with intense violence and some bloody speech) making it not suitable for kids and very weird for adults.9) Very predictable ending10) Unoriginal , it just copies it's plot from other movies.Watching Lion King for 10000 times is better for you than this ... shame on you Pixar just what the **** I just watched !!"
" Favorite film ""Amazing""

" One star for the funny dog .... err: human
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,1,The Dinosaur is not good at all. Neither at the beginni g nor at the end of his transformation. He only profits from the little human who travels with him. And he does nothing good during the whole movie (apart from not killing the little human when he could).
" starsI DROWNED THAT CROC IN MY OWN BLOOD
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,5,"The film starts off with a comical meteor head fake which gave me a chuckle as the movie starts out being funny on two levels. Unfortunately that was my last real laugh. This was the age when talking dinosaurs with knowledge of agriculture and architecture lived with feral humans. Think Dino and the Flintstones in role reversals. Arlo is the runt of his siblings wanting to make his mark. He is tasked with killing the varmint eating their corn...a human. Oh yes they live in temperate zone America...or so it seems. He is a scared Brontosaurus type who is awkward and has trouble killing the human, eventually named Spot, who acts like a dog. The film didn't turn interesting again until Sam Elliot enters the scene, but by then it was too little too late.I am sure the younger kids will like it while older ones may crave something else. It is something for family night."
" Unoriginal. Unfunny. Nothing special.
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,2,"The Croods meets The Lion King. I was not impressed with the story and the characters were also very bland. The animation was inconsistent. The story itself was melodramatic at times and downright silly when it was intended to be funny. This might appeal to a young age demographic.Otherwise, give this one a skip."
" Not bad, but
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,4,Not for kids... Some point this is very sad. And horrifying.
" The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly Dinosaur
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,6,"The Good:This movie is gorgeous. As I was watching it with my younger brother (James) and my mom, Mom would comment how you could tell that they sometimes used actual footage and put animation over it. It's so good she was convinced that some of it was real. While I must give the character models award to Zootopia, that movie is edged by the landscapes and nature that play such an integral role in this film.The story-telling is at its best when it relies on the visuals. The middle of the movie basically serves as a quest to return home while Arlo and the boy Spot bond as they meet new dinosaurs. With this bare plot-line, usually something like dialogue or actions is used to make up for it. And this movie takes a WALL-E approach to dialogue and storytelling for the most part, and scenes such as at night in the riverbed when they talk about their families with the sticks and hardly a word spoken, that is the type of moment that engages the audience and proves that Pixar knows how to please people of all ages.It is during these scenes that the hilarious triceratops and cowboy-like t-rexes are met and enjoyed. They add the differing animal backgrounds well enough like Finding Nemo to keep the ball rolling through the minimal plot. Plus, Steve Zahn (Thunderclap) is always a welcome addition.The boy and dog dynamic is a really neat idea introduced after the 30-minute mark, and it not only plays off well, but it also makes sense. What this does is add more progression to the character development, which is one the movie's main focuses.The Bad:Sadly, the story-telling doesn't work very well when it isn't relying on the visuals. The first 20-30 minutes of the film are disappointingly conventional, and add nothing new to the mix (except for eye-popping visuals). Furthermore, there is a much larger sense of predictability that doesn't matter as far as kids are concerned, but older members of the human species will know exactly what to expect.The main character Arlo is honestly a little too annoying. Of course over the span of the movie he is supposed to grow up and overcome his fears, but the transition happens quickly (the movie is just over 1 Â½ hours) and without much effectiveness.A third act I would kind of compare to Ice Age has a weird sense of wanting to be emotional and dramatic and powerful, but I think even the filmmakers knew it wouldn't have the lasting impression that their other films achieved. And this goes back to both the predictability and the lack of a consistent base throughout the film.The Ugly:This movie suffered through production Hell. The story wasn't quite right, the release date kept being pushed back, and people were fired and had to be recast. Luckily, it isn't some Batman & Robin disaster of a film-- but it still does suffer.Even with an improved story, it is still one of the weakest in that area as far as Pixar movies are concerned. On the bright side of that, however, that's not the focus of the film. And what it does focus on, the two main characters, it doesn't succeed to the level we expect, and also what it simply needs to be. Basically, it falls flat in most areas. But what is not ugly is the visuals. And this goes beyond just what you see on the screen. This takes into account the genuine moments of the film that don't require clunky dialogue to get the point across. It's just a disappointment that there aren't enough of these moments in the film.You can find this review and dozens of others at gillipediamoviereviews.blogspot.com"
" Good CGI ... awful story!
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,3,"The person who made this was on a bad acid trip. That's the only excuse I can think of for this thing with horrible story elements! What the producers were thinking when they read the script makes me think the whole crew was stoned. Maybe it was a bet, ""I'll make the stupidest movie, sell it under Disney's Pixar, and people will love it!"" The premise ... a mentally evolved dinosaur at the dawn of mankind. Man, though he wears clothes and has the hands and dexterity to use tools ... is a dog. Literally. The dinosaur, who can only use his mouth to manipulate tools and items, somehow has ropes and creates baskets, thatched roofs, etc.... somehow creates a farm dwelling in the middle of nowhere, with no other dinosaurs around, in the mountains ... growing corn. Yes. Corn. The cowardly dinosaur falls into the river and gets swept SOOOOO far away that he takes days to get home. But when he falls down a huge swollen waterfall, he just ambles out just a tiny bit winded. I think of all the Disney productions I have ever watched, this is the worst. I would have given it ONE star, except the CGI was really good. Especially with the vistas. The character design ... well, certainly not Pixar's best, that's for certain. So, I gave it 3 stars because kids will enjoy it and visually adults will be good with it ... though I expect most to be as disgusted with the story elements as I was. IF you are going to watch it, I hope you find it for free as I expect you'll be severely disappointed if you pay to watch it."

Watched it for the first time recently and have subsequently watched it hundreds of times as my 19 month old is glued to it and I'm a real fan myself as an adult...it has a good story, great characters, friendships,highly emotional with a powerful message...a real lovely film!Watch it for yourself before you draw your conclusion about it...personally I think it's better than inside out...not that inside out is bad but personally I prefer the good dinosaur!"
" Beautiful... I cried
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,8,"I'm not someone who cries often when watching sad movies, but the tears were streaming down my face and there was nothing I could do about it.Cute characters and an overall well made movie. Even though the end is not very original."
" Brilliant visuals in service to a mediocre story
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,4,"There are two scenes in The Good Dinosaur which stand out for their brilliance. Both wordlessly capture the longing for family and home entirely through a series of simple gestures. It's a great shame then, that the rest of the film that surrounds these scenes is so muddled, cloying and mediocre by comparison.The visual aesthetic here is strange. The vistas and scenery are astoundingly beautiful and the film itself is a technical marvel. Yet the puffy character design looks like something one would find in a CBeebies cartoon, and is ill-fitting when the ground they walk on looks so lifelike.The unfocused nature of the visual design carries over to the story as well. Following a young dinosaur on this journey to get back to his family after being swept away in a storm, learning to bond with a young human boy on the way. The plot points are all rather predictable, which is no bad thing if the writing is strong and characters interesting. However, The Good Dinosaur meanders back and forth through various scenes with no apparent thematic connection to one another. An early standout moment involves the two companions eating dodgy fruit and going on a drug-induced acid trip. No, really.Otherwise, this film is a fairly sub-par re-telling of a well-known story that doesn't really warrant any further mention. The tone lurches back and forth between the cloying and the gruesome; the main characters just aren't very compelling; and the lack of real wit makes the dialogue tiresome to listen to. Were this a silent movie, there would be real potential for something unique and compelling. As it stands, The Good Dinosaur just a below-average Pixar movie."
" Same Old Pixar Story Rehashed
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,3,Bitterly disappointed with TGD. Pixar can do much better than this.
" Not Pixar's Best; But Not Their Worst
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,6,"This is a very sweet, sentimental film and was very refreshing from Pixar. The latest Pixar films have been either disappointing or too focused on being great instead of fun and enjoyable. I am in the minority of people who didn't enjoy Inside Out. I didn't find it very relatable or emotional and thought the story was contrived. That's where The Good Dinosaur succeeds. It doesn't try to be relatable. It does try to be emotional, and succeeds occasionally, but for the most part, it's just a fun, lighthearted adventure film.The Good Dinosaur doesn't try to overreach its status to be considered truly ""great."" It knows what it is and perfectly nails what it does best. People often hate Pixar when they make a film that is different. People hated Cars 2 because it had a story that wasn't trying to touch childhood emotions, but instead create childhood memories for the children who watch it. Brave was criticized for having a princess heroine like regular Disney animated films. People, I suspect, don't like The Good Dinosaur because it doesn't easily fit into every childhood memory or emotionally impact everyone who watches it. My only major problems with this film is that the story isn't always engaging. It has a few plot developments or character introductions that I found unnecessary to the overall structure of the film. Aside from the story, the animation was stunning and made it easier for me to enjoy watching the film. The animation is more simple and lovable than Pixar's most recent attempt at making a ""great"" film, Coco. Where Coco strives for complex, layered shots and animation, The Good Dinosaur is simple, digestible, and realistic (the backgrounds) while still being ridiculous enough to appeal to young kids. Expectations are subverted and common animation movie tropes are avoided. Even the first human child in the film is basically turned into a dog. If this could be appreciated for what it is, and not what it isn't, this could also be a considered a great film, despite its missteps.3.5/5 stars"
" It's nice, quite exciting, but I still think it's a medium film
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,7,"I saw the movie now, the only reason I gave him 7 is that at some moments the film managed to excite me, but I think the plot is pretty bad.
The characters in the film are actually good in my opinion, but have not exhausted their potential. In my opinion, this film has a lot more potential than what you see in the film, both in terms of the characters and in terms of investment. They invested a crazy $ 200 million in this film, favor.
For the plot I would give 5.5 / 10, and the film itself - I give 7/10."
" Well-made family film
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'The Good Dinosaur' is a fun kid's movie that has a few strenuous moments, but I saw it with a five-year-old and she was fine, so its PG rating for ""some scenes may scare young children"" is probably fair. Fairly simple plot - the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago just misses Earth, hence allowing mammals & dinosaurs to evolve and coexist.The story follows Arlo (Ochoa), an Apatosaurus, and his anthropomorphised family, of which Arlo's the runt of the siblings. Wright & McDormand are mum & dad, who spend their time farming. Arlo falls in the river and gets swept away and begins a quest to get back home and is aided by an unlikely partner - Spot (Bright) the human, who's really more of a puppy! Plenty of similarities to 'The Adventures of Milo and Otis' and 'The Lion King', with Arlo having to find his own courage before he can find his family.There's actually not that many dinosaurs (a few T Rex, Pteranodons, Velociraptor and Triceratops) as the film really sticks with Arlo & Spot. The backdrop they're set against, which looks like the mountains of Canada, is superb, with all the scenery seemingly vividly real - truly exceptional CGI, with the only things looking cartoony are the characters! Some sad bits, some funny bits and some lessons for good measure."
" Forgettable and with the worst protagonist I've ever seen.
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,2,"If I had not seen the name Pixar in the title and credits for this movie, I would never believe that this movie belongs to the same studio that brought masterpieces like Wall-E!! Dude, Arlo is the worst protagonist I've ever seen in an animated movie!!!! He has no charisma, he's dull and boring and his design is generic. Cars and Brave are also considered the weakest Pixar movies but at least they had protagonists a little more interesting and striking! Spot is a better character but not extraordinary, and his cute presence is not able to save the movie from complete disgrace. The script is very uninspired and without identity, being simply a heap of situations already seen in other animations, which happen to have no connection with each other, which makes Arlo's journey tiresome and boring. The villains were one- dimensional and shallow. And what the heck was these cartoonish dinosaurs interacting in these overly realistic landscapes? This didn't match and was very strange !!"
" Not great, not mediocre, not bad
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,5,"This movie wasn't terrible, but it didn't present anything new or special. It was basically a soap opera with dinosaurs, with a tragic element that didn't fit with what people think of when they think of dinosaurs. The movie was somewhat like watching superheroes seeking psychotherapy. It humanizes dinosaurs by making them thoughtful and intelligent lizards that struggle to make sense out of the cruel world around them.Now, as I said, it wasn't awful, and not the worst of the Pixar flicks, but it didn't work, ultimately. Most of us wanted to see dinosaurs struggle with dinosaur issues, not struggle with human issues. We got enough of that from Brave and the daughter-mother relationship problems."
" A movie to spend free time, but not one that will stay with you.
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,6,"This movie is about visuals. They put a lot of effort into showing the beauty of nature. They did a great job in that, the landscapes looked real, as though they went out into the fields and filmed it directly. But it's a flat story. I was unsatisfied by many of the interactions, especially at the end: the reactions were not natural, as though they didn't have time to add some feeling and movement to it other than smiling faces. Except there was actually plenty of space for it, they just didn't use it.The highlight of the movie for me was the portrayal of little critters, the worms, the bugs, and the dog-like behavior of the kid, those were done adorably! (Aka, the highlight was a side aspect of the movie.)The next best part were the lessons they made. Face your fears instead of running away from them. Work to earn your mark. Help others as others have helped you like a good Samaritan. Value your nuclear family. (But that's about it.) It felt as though the movie was mostly centered on the dangers of the moment. You can learn the lesson of facing your fears in their short ""Piper"" much better and in much less time than in this movie.All in all, it's not a bad movie, especially because it's aimed at kids, but I think kids are smart enough and strong enough that they can take Wall-E or even Leon the Professional, without a problem, those are nourishing films; basically, don't expect this to be anything more than something to pass time.I'm sad to give a mediocre review of a Pixar movie (also was skeptical about them joining Disney) but I'm hoping it's just the result of it being more of a Disney production than a Disney-Pixar one."
" A Good Dinosaur, A Good Cry
",2017-10-20 00:00:00,6,"This movie isn't one of Pixar's best, but it is a nice film. I enjoyed the relationship between Spot and Arlo. It was endearing and adorable. I found it enjoyable to watch their relationship grow during their pilgrimage to find Arlo's home. With that said, it was really sad. The movie is heavy on grief and heartache. The humor that there was definitely helped balance that out, but I think it was one of the more solemn films from Pixar. It's non-stop hardship and it got a bit depressing. However, there are a lot of really sweet moments about family and friendship that made me smile. I think parents will get more out of this than kids, but the movie is certainly entertaining for both adults and children."
" Beautiful scenery, lackluster characters
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,3,"Other reviews are too extreme in either direction, I feel.Pros: Beautifully rendered, hyper-realistic scenery. I constantly found myself in awe of the sheer artistic talent that went into creating the mountains, trees, and water. I even thought for a second that the water had to have been video-recorded and spliced in. The premise of the movie was also incredibly promising. Detail went into certain aspects of the characters; for instance, Arlo's toes would spread when he put weight on them. Additionally, the movie seemed to be TRYING for positive messages: it's okay to be afraid, not everyone can be judged by their appearance, etc.Cons: Everything else. The characters themselves are not very interesting aside from the first thought of ""That's not what I expected."" Accents and lifestyles are, however, pretty stereotypical after that. The ""good dinosaur"" is not really good; he's mostly afraid and looking for help (see below for example). He's jealous of his brothers. The brothers exhibit bullying behavior. There are a couple of scenes that seem to be hinting at drug use. My biggest hangup: There is no reason that the characters had to be a dinosaur and a human. It's like a boy and his dog got re-skinned as these other species in an attempt to draw in a crowd. I wanted it to be more DINOSAUR-ish!!Anyway, I've seen worse movies, but this was a disappointment, especially coming from Pixar. My toddler liked the dinosaur, but she didn't get the subtly projected social messages--negative or positive. I did, and I don't care for most of them.**MILD SPOILER** Arlo does not spare the kid out of compassion, but out of fear. How, then, is Arlo ""good?!"""
" Nope. Stop being Disney, Pixar.
",2017-09-21 00:00:00,5,"That was a lame movie. Sure, it was masterfully done, but the characters are just cookie-cutter Disney. The only kinda creative move was the turnaround with the human being the ""pet"", everything else is Pixar-untypical bland.Something just rubs me the wrong way when i see dinosaurs being overly humanized. Several movies messed that up, most famously ""Dinosaurs"" in 2000. While we had humanized animals forever in cartoons, having cartoon T-Rex placed peacefully alongside herbivore dinos in a super-realistic world with all kinds of American accents, planting crops and herding cattle, is overkill for my taste. As characters they have nothing in common with dinosaurs.Add to that the story, which is a basic ""kid and his dog cross the wild west"" plot. It's a 60ies Disney-western, coming-of-age story, where each human character was replaced by a dino. Nowhere near the creativity of an ""Up"" or the colorful characters of ""Monsters Inc"".It's a good movie for small children and people with low expectations towards logic and realism. No tough topics like death and violence, just easy-going entertainment without any challenge. If you expect Pixar quality, look elsewhere."
" So glad I didn't spend any money on this one
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,4,"I am so glad I didn't spend any money on this movie, I borrowed it from the library. Used to be the name Pixar meant quality. Now that is no longer true. When it got to the end (finally), I thought to myself what was this supposed to be about. What was the purpose of it? How many of you knew when Poppa and Arlo went out that Poppa wasn't coming back? Too often done in these ""children's"" movies, do you think? Then the poor grammar--what's the point of that? That animals aren't smart enough to speak properly? Really? Cavemen here are so dumb that they can't even speak at all and likewise they can't walk upright either. Tired of this indoctrination to children. If cavemen were that dumb, they would not have survived and we wouldn't be here."
" We LOVE The Good Dinosaur
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,10,"I read some of the reviews and MAN...there are some stuck up, uptight people out there. It is a freaking cartoon! It is about feeling LOSS, FAMILY, and finding COURAGE, FRIENDSHIP, and LOVE! My son loves this movie and so do I. We have sat through this movie more than a dozen times and I still tear up at the end. The only thing I can say is that there isn't a ""catchy tune"" that came from the movie. It wasn't really a musical. But the animation and scenery are gorgeous! And the characters are endearing."
" Technical Marvel... Narrative Flop
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,5,"'THE GOOD DINOSAUR' was directed by Peter SOHN and stars Raymond OCHOA, Jack BRIGHT and Steve ZAHN. â€‹Luckily for young Arlo, his parents (Jeffrey Wright, Frances McDormand) and his two siblings, the mighty dinosaurs were not wiped out 65 million years ago. When a rainstorm washes poor Arlo (Raymond Ochoa) downriver, he ends up bruised, battered and miles away from home. Good fortune shines on the frightened dino when he meets Spot (Jack Bright), a Neanderthal boy who offers his help and friendship. Together, the unlikely duo embark on an epic adventure to reunite Arlo with his beloved family.When I say this movie is a technical marvel, I genuinely mean that. I recommend the movie purely to witness the masterwork that is the animation and cinematography because that is where this movie thrives.Pixar is known for two things: stunning animation and brilliant story. As stated prior, it achieves the first part 10 fold, it is in the latter where this falters. Pixar plots have mostly been very well written and contain a great moral. Toy Story, Up, Finding Nemo, Inside Out etc - all these movies have fantastic plots and morals and all of them are at least good movies. Plot is where this movie fails.Expanding on that point is the lack of a strong moral in this movie. Ratatouille teaches that every dream is possible and Inside Out teaches that sadness is a valid emotion. The Good Dinosaur dabbles in the admirable concept that fear is a valid thing. And that is something I would definitely be behind. Alas, they abandon this moral swiftly after it is established and that seems counter productive to me. I am very disappointed by Pixar here. It may be my fault for having high standards but I don't think that that is down to me, and more down to Pixar's previously consistent quality.Raymond Ochoa was perfectly passable as Arlo but passable is where it ends. He doesn't shine and he is pretty much the only real character in the film. Combine that with a poorly written character and you have a lack of sympathy from me. Jack Bright's performance is impossible to give a proper critique on due to its nature thus I wont comment on it much. I can, however, comment on the character he portrayed. Spot was a very entertaining character and can probably create a few laughs but he lacks a driving force to make him compelling. Granted, a lack of the ability to speak can stump a character's growth but I still didn't feel a connection to him at any point and that is definitely an issue for the film; I did not care.I should do a full segment on the villain but Steve Zahn's 'Thunderclap' was so weak and disappointing that I just had to google the character's name. My time is best spent on other aspects of the film so all I will say is the villain is awful.Side characters, such as Sam Elliot's Butch or Jefferey Wright's Poppa, were fine and interesting enough but they merely served as plot points and thus had negative time to blossom.I want to praise this movie because it definitely excels in some aspects. It is a masterpiece of technical film making. If you want evidence of it, just google 'The Good Dinosaur Water' and find a YouTube video of it. It is beautiful and magnificent to behold. I am happy I saw it just because of how spectacular the animation is for this movie and I recommend it entirely for that. Combine this amazing animation with jaw dropping cinematography and you have a technical masterpiece.This movie is pretty funny and I laughed at a few jokes. I will at least give it that. But a good animated film will include both good humour and good heart. This movie lacks true heart and emotion. They try REALLY hard to squeeze emotion out of me, and I have previously been happy for Pixar to milk money out of my eyes but this time it didn't work. The blatant and non-ironic use of Disney clichÃ©s make this movie just seem like it is trying to evoke emotion and that just doesn't work. Disconnection to the characters means I don't care about their fate and that means I can't enjoy a film. A conclusion is just as important as the journey, but if the journey is weak; the conclusion is meaningless.I do recommend this movie. As much as I critiscise it, it is one of those rare movies I can recommend purely for one aspect of it. I'll rate the movie 5 'DEBBIEs' out of 10 and a fair recommendation. Just don't expect Pixar to be at the height of its' power."
" Ecellent programming and religious messages
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,5,"I really do not want to watch other people reviews on this movie, but this movie is heavily fueling religious messages, rather than real feelings. That's why only 5. Religion sunk it. Comparing it to a beautiful story of Cars (original movie) where a friendship is a main message, it really sunk in my eyes. Fiver for this movie is for excellent computer graphics."
" An underrated movie if I've ever seen one.
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,8,"I don't usually write reviews here but I felt compelled to make at least a short one for this movie.The Good Dinosaur is a simple movie. We follow the story of Arlo, an Apatosaurus who got separated from his family, and needs to find his way back home, while in the process meeting a small human child and he creates a bond with him. I personally think that was one of the movie's strongest points. The bond between this two characters was so sweet and entertaining that it kept me invested throughout the whole movie. And it made every emotional moment hit pretty hard, and oh boy... two scenes in particular were directed so well that I was almost tearing up, which caught me completely by surprise.The other strong point of the film is the landscape animation: it looks almost photo-realistic. Absolutely gorgeous stuff. I do admit that sometimes it clashes with the character animation, which is more cartoony, but that didn't really bother me that much.Ultimately, even though I understand some people's disappointment with the film considering it is different from some other Pixar movies, I strongly recommend to people that haven't seen it to give it a go. Just know what you are getting into. You are gonna watch a smaller scale, character focused, humble movie, that doesn't shine because of it's concept, but because of its execution.The movie starts kinda slow, but I would say after Arlo gets separated from its family, and for the rest of the movie, is where it really shines.Also, it definitely has some intense parts and it is definitely aimed towards both kids and adults. One scene in particular actually shocked me and caught me by surprise. It took me a couple of seconds to remember I was watching a Pixar movie.TL;DR - Try to watch the movie and make your own opinion. If you go with standard expectations, and you appreciate the movie for what it is, I can almost assure you, you will enjoy it."
" 10/10
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,10,"How much could this movie make me cry? The answer is A LOT. It felt like I was constantly crying or laughing throughout the entire film. How could I wait this long before watching it? And to think that I almost didn't because I thought it would be boring?! Honestly shame on the person I was 90 minutes ago, she didn't know sh*t."
" Still fighting about this at home - so much better than Inside Out
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,8,"One of my favorite Pixar Movies. Not as good as Wall-e, but I've watched it more often than Brave. My Girlfriend LOVED Inside Out. I wasn't a fan. It was a fine movie, but didn't hold my interest at all. I LOVE The Good Dinosaur. It reminds me of films I watched as a kid. Though no where near as scary as Bambi, or as emotionally intense as Dumbo. Some have said it was too intense. I thought Lion King was a far more intense than this one. Spoilers:I think it's a really great story of a shy kid coming to terms with his fear of the unknown and becoming a young man. He realized that relationships are the most important things. Loved it. Moments of transcendent beauty and joy. Great film."
" 'Good' might be overstepping a bit
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,6,"Disney Pixar's ""The Good Dinosaur"" misses nearly every mark it attempts to hit. It just tries too hard to tug at your heartstrings and falls into the trap of telling and not showing. It spends the first forty minutes telling you just how poor little Arlo struggles with life, telling us that he needs our sympathy instead of letting us reach that conclusion on our own. The film also didn't quite seem to know where to take the story; adding unnecessary deaths and random villainous characters to motivate our hero who doesn't seem to be motivated to do much of anything. The story could have worked just as well, perhaps even better without the entire premise of humans and dinosaurs living side be side. It cheapened the tale to a knock off of a much superior film you might know called ""Ice Age."" Disney is known for its heartwarming and honest tales of self discovery that help to shape the children who see them, but this one will certainly be categorized as a miss and forgotten shortly hereafter.The movie does have its entertaining moments, particularly with the wrangling cowboy Tyrannosauruses, but overall this film can be passed over without your having missed much. 6/10"
" Look beyond the obvious
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,9,"All of the negative reviews about this movie are proof that as a society, we've somewhat lost our ability to read between the lines of a story to see the true message behind it. This movie is entirely about fear. About how it can shape our lives, keep us stuck, and come in all sorts of forms... some expected, and some not. Ultimately it's about confronting your own personal fears and showing that you really have to do it alone in the end for it to stick... that we're all more brave than we think, and that even the worst case scenario can turn out to have a silver lining. Important lesson for our kids to learn, right? Of COURSE the movie is scary in parts. It's about fear! How can it successfully get the message across without being somewhat scary? Didn't we all grow up with movies like Old Yeller and The Lion King, where a serious lesson was taught not through only happiness, but fear and sadness, too? In addition, it's a super clever spin on a traditional western. And it flips the stereotype that a human would always be the hero and not the sidekick on its head in a totally entertaining way. Anyone who has raised a toddler should be able to find the humor in Critter/Spot. I would wholeheartedly recommend you check this movie out. It's beautifully and subtly done, and imparts a valuable lesson if you dare to look deeper inside to find it."
" Good lessons for small children
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,6,"The Good Dinosaur is a feast for the eyes, really wonderfully animated with amazing almost real backgrounds and water. My favorite scenes were the night ones, when the fireflies and the starry sky, which are beautifully artistic. The Good Dinosaur is mostly a coming-of-age story, transitioning from child to boy. The movie teaches children great life lessons, and that is, to me, the main virtue of the film: > They have to find their own pace in life, and have to be patient if they move slower than others. The important thing is to get where you want to get, it doesn't matter how long it takes. > Being strong and being powerful are two different things. > The beauty and power of mateship. > Fear needs to be embraced, not feared, as embracing it will make them face any adversity and overcome any struggle. > They belongs with their family, no matter how much they love their friends. > Their parents will do anything to support and defend them, but part of growing up is just learning to be independent. > They are capable of more than they credit themselves for. The story happens in an alternative past when the meteorite that caused the extinction of dinosaurs never fell on earth, allowing dinosaurs and humans to coexist. I thought that was a good start. The creative possibilities are endless, although The Pebbles sounds like a very credible alternative past. So the creators probably didn't want to go there, understandably. Unfortunately, the path they took is a road to Bananaland. It turns a herbivorous dinosaur with the brain of a chicken into a farmer. What the heck? Not even that, the kiddo who becomes dino Arlo's best friend behaves more like a dog than a primitive man, tongue hanging out and all. There are some touching tender moments in the film, and some funny moments too, but the film is overly dramatic for small children, with tragedy after tragedy, violent scene after scary scene, and it's too much.The characters were a mix bunch, overall funny (the tyrannosaurus), scary (the Pterosaurus), human (the brachiosaurus) and brute but domesticable (the human kiddo). I especially loved the voice of Jeffrey Wright as Poppa and Frances McDormand as Momma. Very warm and charming.A lovely family film, especially good for small children. Not the best Pixar's for sure."

" Not up to Pixars standards
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,2,"There's a formula for writing stories that Pixar uses that usually guarantees their films to be a success, but it seems like they missed out some major steps of that formula when making The Good Dinosaur.The protagonist, Arlo, is an unoriginal, clichÃ©d character. A giant creature that's scarred of his own shadow. I remember countless stories from my childhood with characters like that because writing a story for them & developing them as characters is the easiest thing to do. They are afraid of everything, they get braver, they accomplish what they set out to do. Very poor for a Pixar story. Plus as a character, Arlo was just annoying, I never found myself rooting for him & was never concerned whenever he was in danger. In every other Pixar film I wanted the characters to succeed in their goals. Arlo could have been devoured & that would have been like the end of an annoying ringing noise, quite grateful for it. Also, personally I felt they did a perfect job of casting the person that did his voice because it was just annoying as everything else about him.Spot, the small human, was a fun character but that was because he was basically a dog. No other characters were worth mentioning at all. Once again, very peculiar for a Pixar film.Pixar films are usually great fun for the whole family, across all age ranges, but The Good Dinosaur seems it would only be enjoyable by young children due to the extremely simplistic story & characters.TL;DR Lead character was annoying & unoriginal, as was the whole film."
" A Delightful, Touching and Incredible Pixar Movie
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"I know a lot of people don't like this movie, It's pretty mixed with the critics and Is considered one of the most underrated Pixar films of all time.Now with films like this one, I was pretty excited to see this, I will say I'm not on the hate train with everyone else or agreeing with everything that the critics say, I'm more open to the film then have actual issues with the film It's self and I must say this is actually a surprisingly really incredible film from Pixar.The concept sounds great, the story is well executed, beautifully, realistic animation along with creative and well done character designs, the characters are emotionally likable, the scenes with Arlo and Spot are heartbreaking, It has some great moments and an excellent score by Mychael Danna & Jeff Danna.One of the big problems I have is some of the characters don't get much screen and they are actually interesting like, Butch, Nash, Ramsey, Thunderclap, Forrest Wood bush and the Velociraptors, another is that, this film is WAY too dark, I know It can make a film more Interesting If It's done right and with this It does It right for the most part, but some seem a little unnecessary and feel like It's a completely different movie.It's not the best from Pixar, but It's a lot better then Brave, Cars, Cars 2 and MU, go give It a watch, It's still a pleasantly surprising film that deserved more then It should of.I will give this a 9/10."

I absolutely loved it and feel it is severely underestimated as far as Disney movies go. I don't get the bad reviews, and why in the hell this movie is below 8 stars? I laughed, I cried, laughed again, cried again the movie will bring you through the story and make you feel and captivate you. If that's not what Disney is supposed to be about then I don't know what is. The messages are heart warming, the story line will keep your attention, there are little spoofs particularly for the adults to that go right over the kids heads which is great and takes a lot of skill in my humble opinion.Watch it! Its worth it!"
" Good movie. It may not rank up against the best of Pixar but it sure is great
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"Pixar and Disney's latest is an animated adventure based on the premise that 65 million years ago dinosaurs never went extinct and are more advanced than the human race. When a rainstorm washes poor Arlo (Raymond Ochoa) downriver, he ends up bruised, battered and miles away from home. Good fortune shines on the frightened dinosaur when he meets Spot (Jack Bright), a Neanderthal boy who offers his help and friendship. Together, the unlikely duo embark on an epic adventure to reunite Arlo with his beloved family. The photo realistic landscapes are breathtaking and the film has real heart and a few scary moments young children might find a bit too much. It's a great family film and definitely recommended."
" A simple movie lacking in emotional and character relationship depth
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,5,"This movie had no diverse plot or character development. The relationships between characters wasn't in-depth at all, especially between the boy and the dinosaur. The main title of the movie depicts only them, but the movie does absolutely nothing to show that they mean anything to each other. Their friendship is undeveloped, but suddenly, they act like they would die for each other. The boy's inability to speak throughout the movie is annoying as well, and the illustrations aren't good. The movie is very simple and basic, with no real twists, turns, depth, convoluted plans, but just a very simple story line that suits very young children. For all the advertisements and trailers of this movie, it should have been much better. Some emotional parts were captivating, however, such as the father being gone and when the dinosaur has to save the boy. But other than that, it is lacking.*5/10*"
" a little forced but enjoyable nonetheless
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"Ever since Brave came out, Pixar has had trouble delivering solid stories, they are good, but not excellent like Ratatouille, Toy Story or The Incredibles. Visually stunning as always, but the story felt a little forced, they killed off the father like 10 minutes into the film, not delivering enough scenes where we could see like the love he had for him, or the good times they spent together, it felt as if something tragic just had to happen so they killed off the dad. It was just like with the elephant from inside out, he vanishes in what is supposed to be an emotional scene, but one did not see the connection he had with the girl, therefore I didn't feel anything when he vanished. Too many characters that appear and disappear, they should have focused more on only arlo and spot, developed more their relationship. Ending was good, but I didn't understand the whole human family stuff. And, arlo arrives and the mother is just there? they didn't go looking for him lol. Far from Pixar's best, but enjoyable, and better than inside out in my opinion."
" Not at all original.
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,4,"I watched this movie last night without any idea what it would be about, other than there would be a good dinosaur. I'm sorry, but this movie was so try hard. Trying to follow in the great footsteps of The Lion King, it just fell flat, as all copy cats will do. Watching Arlo running around with his father in the field at night made me instantly think of the Lion King, and expect that the dad will die in the next scene. The next scene they're out in the storm, the father, climbing rocks slips and falls to be carried away, not by a stampede, but a raging torrent, the stampede was later, after Arlo was trying to roar on a rock, then had to hide behind it, so as to not be hurt by the stampede. No, the story wasn't the same, but it was so obviously borrowing scenes from the great Lion King, and this made it trite. I also can't believe the drug references and the fact cute animals got eaten and torn to shreds. The animation would suggest they're aiming at really tiny kids, the acting would suggest definitely not. I later realised it was PG, it was just so ridiculously babyish of a movie apart from that, the cartooning, the characters, the really stupid story line that has been done sooooo many times before. One last criticism. Couldn't the writers take a little bit of time coming up with a way of life that wasn't 'red neck American' seriously? Ick. The only reason I decided to watch this movie was the fact it was Pixar. Oh Pixar, what has happened to you."
