" The proof of God
",2021-04-10 00:00:00,9,"This movie really is underrated.Very underrated actually.Look, indeed for giving a high rating, I must be a christian, and indeed I am.But, I am not rating this high just for it being a christian movie.In this movie, I was actually really hooked.Sure, it had it's cheesy moments, but the truth in it's script was amazing!I couldn't stop myself thinking of it, and my body shivered from my spirit bouncing with joy to hear God's word come to life, even with evidence too!How cool is that?!I know many of the users out there who wrote these bad reviews wouldn't be Christians with their reasons for disliking Christianity and therefore giving it a bad review, and I understand.But, with this movie it really shows the truth of God's word and I really do believe anyone wanting to find God in their loves should watch this.From the bottoms of my heart, I hope all of you out there find Jesus, and know that he loves you for all eternity and no matter what you do, he will forever love you still.God bless you all."

" They straight up murdered the professor
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,1,"This is the literal ending of the movie2 dudes in a car (probably some good christians we've seeing before with no context whatsoever) straight up drove over a man and escaped the scene, then, someone (i guess he may have been important to the movie idk haven't watched it in years, not even sure we saw who drove the man over) notices it and goes to...Guess whatGet a confession out of him, not helping, just asking him if he believes in god,and apparently god only kept him alive just for h to say he believes in god, and right after that he just dies, and that's it, the boy gets the girl and everyone parties happily ever after."
" Disingenuous
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,1,"""God's Not Dead."" There really aren't many words to adequately describe it and, at this point, it's been pretty accurately and fairly scrutinized in dozens of YouTube videos. In terms of faith-based movies sourced from songs, God's Not Dead ranks near the absolute bottom of the tier listing. Now, movies based off songs aren't inherently bad (the same can also be said for religious movies; they aren't all inherently bad), but the way in which this movie portrays literally everything from the first frame to the last is done entirely wrong at every step of the way.Directed by the remarkably underwhelming Harold Cronk and released through religious propaganda machine/Netflix competitor PureFlix, God's Not Dead tells the story of a group of people who bravely and selflessly stand up for their faith. The... pleasure begins with a young man who refuses to write the words ""God is Dead"" on a piece of paper in a class, thus engaging in a long-standing debate to try to convince the professor that God does, in fact, still exist and is not dead. If it sounds redundant, that's because it is. The movie is as lacking in proper plot points and compleling story that it could effectively be used to replace insomnia medications. The acting is wooden at best, the music (even from the ""big"" band, Newsboys, who recorded the title track) is mediocre, and the entire film is a long piece of Christian propaganda. It's disingenuous to the core with massive overreactions to the smallest character developments. Then again, from a Christain production, are we really surprised? The more they create, the more apparent it becomes that they don't know how anyone outside their tight-knit religious communities live their lives.The character of the atheist is clearly the villain, further driving the message that anyone who disagrees with or challenges the Christian worldview is automatically evil and cannot be trusted. Allegedly, at Newsboys concerts, scenes from the film would routinely be played and the audience would boo loudly at the atheist character, which is always a good way to influence skeptics into your religion. It's clearly a Christian actor trying his hardest to be an edgy, hardcore atheist but it falls as flat as everything else. The portrayal is unrealistic as the overwhelming majority of atheists couldn't possibly be any less concerned with Christians. And yet this film, instead of just being a fluffy piece of propaganda, has to go so far as to completley villify any opposition.This film presents a one-sided worldview, tainted entirely by Christian glasses. Everyone who doesn't fit their narraitve is automatically painted as the ""bad guy,"" from the atheist character to the upset parents who apparently can't handle their children's wishes to switch to Christianity. As we've seen countless times in Christian movies, the victim card is played in this one, too, but it's turned up to the highest level. This film, to the faithful, shows the threats against Christianity as a society and, through blatant untruths and harmful stereotypes, seeks to villify anyone who would dare to disagree. The movie ends with a message that is both bleak and desperate: a call to all Christians to text ""God's Not Dead"" to everyone in their phone contact list... as if that's ever going to convert anyone.If anything, it gives the religiously unaffiliated a chance to laugh at the fact that you not only went to see this film and funded these propaganda pieces created by people who are NOT filmmakers, but that you were so moved by having your one-dimensional worldview catered to for an hour and a half that you actually fell for the texting trap.Christians, you are capable of making decent movies. But you choose preachers to become filmmakers, and the end results are always awful. They make you guys look bad and, although your worldview may be as one-dimensional as an early Walt Disney animated short, it's just not the reality of the world. This film furthers the divide between Christians and the rest of the world. But, after suffering through it again and looking closely at the plot, that appears to be the overarching purpose.Colossal waste of time. Please just watch something else. Son of the Mask would give you better entertainment value for your money's worth."
" Wonderful exposure of the Godless elite
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,10,"This film is so good I have watched it 4 times already. It has changed me from a Godless and unhappy individual into a true believer. It convincingly demolishes the facile and negative Liberal agenda and opens our eyes to the true love of God. Excellent performances throughout and it kept me riveted to the screen. We need
much more like this"
" Not the best
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,5,God's Not Dead really isn't a bad movie. It just has some very problematic problems that hold it back from actually being good.
" The Best Christian Series EVER
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,10,"This is the best Christian comedy i ve ever watched! without a doubt ya will fall in love with Christ too!prepare to enjoy an extraordinary movie! you will believe a lot!it is important to highlight that even when you are gonna have fun, you will have the opportunity to learn at the same time about the social problems that the heathen/no Christian have. public university students have to face adversity and yet one stands up for Christ. (family disintegration, school dropouts, the high consumption of brands - cartier, armani,etc- among youth. adolescents, mediocre professors, etc)"
" Unintentionally hilarious
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,3,The scene where the professor gets hit by a car then the preacher man randomly appears and starts preaching to him whilst he suffers to death might be unintentionally the funniest thing ive ever seen.
" So much anger and hate!!
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,10,"No it is not a 10 star movie, but after seeing the dismal 4.7 I was sure it was given a lot of VERY low ratings by those who disagree with the content. It is actually a decent movie, good plot, acceptable acting and directing and entertaining. It also hits on a lot of truth as to how Christians are treated in a country that is increasingly becoming non-Christian. And, while the scenarios are exaggerated to make the point, (mostly Dean Cain and Kevin Sorbo's) There are many people in this country that behave like their characters to varying degrees. I would suggest, watch the movie, be open minded and realize, that other opinions beside your own may very well be valid. And if you can not do that. Try to understand that they still have the right to feel differently on a subject. If even that is beyond your abilities. . you may be a closed minded, ignorant, egotist."
" Flawed writing throughout
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,3,"The character writing is flawed and biased. Everyone who doesn't believe in a Christian God is evil. This film had so much potential to argue the philosophy. The writers have ignored so many good arguments, both for and against the existence of God.
My biggest grudge with this film is the philosophy professor who crushes and scorns his class for daring to challenge him. This is the whole foundation of the subject. If you can't face having your beliefs challenged don't become a philosophy professor."
" Shameless propaganda
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,1,"I really am legitimately shocked that a film like this can even exist. I don't know if the film's writers really, genuinely believe that everyone who doesn't follow their particular brand of Christianity must be miserable or evil, but that's certainly the worldview this film espouses.The film's portrayal of atheism is so shockingly cartoonish and disingenuous, clearly rooted purely in pandering to an audience of extremely conservative American Christians who want to feel oppressed, rather than any interest in actually portraying the nuances and complexities that can shape a person's faith, or lack thereof. I'm amazed that anyone can truly see the world in the sort of childishly simplistic, black-and-white terms that this film portrays it in - I think that, even when I was twelve years old (and I was Christian back then, mind you), I would have known that this film's portrayal of theism and atheism was completely warped. But this film reminded me that some people really do not have any interest in perceiving the world in any way other than ""me and people like me good, everyone else bad""."
" Happened to me
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,10,"I can deal with agnostics, as I was one back in the 1970s, as they are not hostile, I can't deal with atheists, which is obvious many of these posters are, because they are hostile. For those who typed being persecuted in college doesn't happen, you're totally wrong. I was back in the late 70s by a college professor. It was a threat said to the whole class on day one that if anyone admits they are a Christian they will get an F. This was in an advanced science class so no I'm not a dufus. I thought the movie was just fine and realistic."
" Great Christian Film
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,9,"Very good job to the cast and director. It is great to see them make a film with such meaning and to separate us from the sinful tragic nonsense in most
school films. keep up the good work !"
" God Wasn't Dead... But this Movie Killed Him
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,1,"I grew up in a Southern Baptist Church, and ended up studying sociology and philosophy in college. And this movie seems to be aimed at people like me. So, here are my thoughts:Christians should be ashamed of this film. Intolerant, hateful, and poorley written, this mess of a movie puts the absolute ignorance of it's creators on display. It follows the story of a Christian college student attending a philosophy class taught by an Atheist professor, who expects his students to embrace Atheism in order to pass his class. The problem is, the writers had no understanding of true philosophy, which not only accepts all beliefs, but welcomes open discussion about morality and theism from all points of view. In fact, it is impossible to discuss or study philosophy without discussing religion and beliefs therein. And they also presumably had never attended a non-Christian university to understand that forcing beliefs upon students as part of a grade would never, ever happen at any certified college. These problems aside, the narrative is full of nonsense filler, unrealistic drama, and bad acting. Misrepresentation of Atheists comes across as hateful propaganda, portraying atheism as evil and inherently lacking in any morals. The movie takes an absolutist stance, and feels more like a propaganda piece created by a cult then a movie made by followers of Jesus Christ. Love, understanding, and acceptance are nowhere to be found here, nor is anything resembling a quality movie. If God wasn't dead before this film released, He surely is now."
" Wow, that was hard to get through
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,2,The worst movie I watched in 2014. Was for a family function- even terrible compared to most low-budget Christian flicks.
" Trying so hard to make a point where it isn't...
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,1,"Film makers portrayed everyone who doesn't believe in God or believes other Gods as evil, or bad, angry people, or even mishaps happen, like car doesn't start or traffic lights change just to trick an atheist into a hit and run :D.
Never in my life i have felt anything bad because of the fact that i don't believe in God. If something happened bad with me it was my own fault, because of my poor judgment or some moment i did or didn't do something, but not because there is God who controlls everything :D. Movie was totally wrong and dishonest. Biased towards christians and God. Troughout the movie i was thinking - ""that's not how things happen in real life!""."
" I basically created IMDB just to review THIS MOVIE!! iT'S SO GOOD
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,10,"What bothers me is how many 1 star reviews stating ""i'm disgusted"" and ""how awful"" this movie was, that I couldn't help but to register for an account and place my opinion on this movie.I have very few movies that will stick to me for life, this movie is one of them. The protagonist used apologetics to defend Christianity and I can almost assure that the people whom were offended by this film, are most likely triggered because of some underlying truth they are suppressing. In the film, the atheist professor was previously a Christian, and due to life circumstances he turned away and decided ""there is no God"".This movie made me cry, it is so powerful down to the ending. I watched it twice, and will probably watch it a few more times to learn how to better defend my faith when questioned."
" Great Movie
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,10,Well written and acted. I can watch this again and again.
" One of the Best Films Made
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. God is truly not dead.The negative comments made here are as stereotypical as some claim this film is. But this film is wonderful, powerful. The acting is superb, and the main character's discussion on God is excellent.There are many paths to God, so to have a negative storyline about another religious path to God wasn't right. Also, the woman speaking up for animals' right to live and not be slaughtered was spot-on. Life is life; all beings are precious in the eyes of God, and with veganism (not around during Jesus' time, BUT was in the perfect world in the Garden of Eden), there is no reason at all to slaughter and eat animals.Outside of that, the rest of the film is terrific. Don't let the ratings keep you from watching it."
" This film kills all love of God
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,1,"What I got from the first 15 minutes of the film:
A Muslim fathers is excessively controlling about wearing a Niqab to cover up properly, and yet he doesn't notice his rather shapely daughter wearing tight clothing.
Christians are persecuted in American colleges. - Don't wear that cross, bruh!
Asian men are emotionless. - token Asian dude
Atheists are vegan and loud about their beliefs. - bumper stickers
Atheists are greedy and transactional. - investor talks to daughter in transactional way. Or is he her much older boyfriend? Can't tell. Creepy.
Ayn Rand is taught in philosophy classes. Rand as a towering intellect? This film is a comedy. I laughed for a minute straight.
Atheism as a lesson? What? The entire concept of a secular university professor teaching that way is absurd. I went to UC Berkeley, the liberal, secularist bastion of society. We never discussed the existence of God because, well, that's religion, not philosophy. The closest we got to discussing God was in a Nietzsche class, where we had to learn and explain Nietzsche's ideas. We were never asked to believe, agree, or like any of it. Our goal was to learn, understand, explain, and identify strengths and weaknesses of complex ideas. We learned to think, not believe. Except for friends, I had no idea of my instructors or classmates were atheists or devout in anything. It just didn't come up, ever.
Before Berkeley, when I took a class named Magic, Witchcraft, and Religion, I learned a lot about magic, witchcraft, and religion across the world. I was never asked to believe or disbelieve any of it.
A philosophy professor who doesn't understand the famous line of Nietzsche? He should demand his money back for that PhD, and every student in that class should demand their money back from the university for having such an incompetent teacher.
The film depicts blatant religious persecution that would cause a lawsuit and a riot at Berkeley. None of us would have sat through such bullying. I'm sure it happens sometimes somewhere, but demanding a class to write that God is dead? That's dramatic, but it's absurd. It builds on the belief that Christians are persecuted in America, which is pretty hilarious since Christians largely control America. Remember, even Biden is Catholic, along with much of the Supreme Court. Then again, Trump as a Christian? Hard for me to believe considering all he has said and done.
No philosophy class asks students to defend or attack their own ideas. If there's one area philosophy professors don't care for one bit, it's the ideas of their students. Jesus Christ, I'm almost 15 minutes into the film and I've written 370 words of how it's gotten so much wrong in such childish ways. I tried watching more, but it's like pulling toenails, so I fast-forwarded and jumped around.Anyway, I thought this would be fun with 4-5 beers. It isn't. It's just poorly made schlock. Painful to behold."
" Halo, I thought they did their job...
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,10,"It was a bit of a homely and it was nice and it was mean and petty and that's life and a lot of people believe in God whatever that means.But I thought the writing did its job, although I could of done without over-emphasizing the already awful stereo-types of Religious people all over the world! lol , that would of been pretty cool, it did its job but unfortunately it leaves one with a very hard and cold look at two simple dispositions that are the foundation for storytelling Good and Bad but never really delves into and quarries out anything within the grey area , nothing in-between that is where true storytelling lives and above all, thrives!"
" Review from a christian
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,2,"The only good thing in this film was zero sex, violence and drugs.The script is awful, most of the acting is awful, although it's probably more the director/cinematographer at fault than the actors themselves.A better, and more factually accurate way to convince yourself/your youth group that God isn't dead is to watch the plethora of debates between intelligent christians and atheists on youtube."
" My thoughts on the film-a mixed bag
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,6,"God's Not Dead is one of the popular Christian movies that has been released recently. The film has garnered hate and has also been critically acclaimed by audiences. However, I want to give my personal opinion on the film without taking any sides. This is probably one of the most mixed reviews I've done on a film, since there are two different opinions I both agree with.
People say this movie is preachy, poorly acted, and it's religious propaganda, and others say that it's an inspiring movie with great messages.
Now, I understand both sides on the film-I mean, let me put this way. The film takes an honest approach at its material-and certainly makes an attempt to share its message. I love when films use this concept because this concept lets me know right off the bat that they're trying to make an honest film which handles questions of God's existence.
I admit, the film is very honest in terms of its subject matter. It certainly makes a good attempt at creating an honest approach to the subject matter, and for this, I do applaud this concept used in God's Not Dead.
Also, some of the performances are pretty good as well. Harper gives an effective portrayal of his character by using dialogue to offer a look at his beliefs, and his acting is effective in creating a likable character that the audience may find themselves rooting for.
Sorbo gives a fine performance as well, sometimes delivering his dialogue in great ways, and sometimes delivering an unrealistic performance in terms of reactions and deliveries. Overall, Sorbo does fine in God's Not Dead.
However, where the film ultimately fails is at its preachy aspect. Now, just because it can be preachy, doesn't mean it's a terrible film. The film still needs some work in its approach to handling the subject matter. The film seems to be forcing the audience to side with their opinion, and as a result, doesn't work in terms of bringing the message home.
Using certain concepts, the film is forceful in its methods of sharing the message. Using certain scenes to do so, the film seems to be attempting to force the viewer to believe its opinion, which comes off as preachy.
A film shouldn't be attempting to make its audience think a certain way or believe a certain way. But, however, God's Not Dead does this when it tries to force its audience to think a certain way.
After all, God's Not Dead is a fine film to watch, but is still too preachy when it comes to sharing its message. However, the performances do shine and I appreciate the film's honest approach to covering its material."
" Propaganda
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,1,Blatant propaganda. Even if it wasn't it's just a poorly written movie and horrible acting. We had fun making fun of it though!
" good
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,10,"I am a christian.
as a movie is not great..but there are a number of scenes where you learn a lot of things about your fate .
for me one of it was when the preacher ask the student: if they dont hear the gospel from you in class , do you think they will ever come in a place like a church to hear it?
that s a strong argument when you think about defending you fate in school.
and the debate was simple and good.
a few good idea but strongs as well.
its all about faith
even Dowkins say that jesus is a real istorical person and that he dont know for sure how the univers comes to live, but HE BELIEVE that his view is the better one(univers come from nothing)"
" Stop attacking religion
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,10,"Anger is not a good thing-ever! What does it mean for you to be so angry about this movie? Actually watch the movie and you will find out. Nobody (of any faith, or lack of) are portrayed as villains in this film.And guess what, no one is attacking you. Maybe you need to look a little deeper in to yourself, don't worry, I will pray for you!"
" Conversations had me crying
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,10,"Christian or not, we can't deny the fact that God at LEAST exists in everyday conversations. This movie shows how God pops up in everyday conversations in families, at college, or in any relationship with another. There are many people that will be bias about it because they do not like or believe in a God, but the movie itself is inspiring and heartbreaking and the same time."
" Propoganda
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,1,"This movie is all about religion. It tries to shove Christianity down your throat, while painting every other religion as bad. The whole movie is an advertisement for Christianity. The movie is full of bad acting, and manages to make you hate every person in the movie, even the protagonist. The only person that I could see enjoying this movie, is Ned Flanders. I want my time back."
" Nothing short of Christian propaganda
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,2,"I remember being forced to watch this with my dad and looking back, all I can say is ""Wow! It goes without saying but this movie was terrible. It's so bias and manipulative in how it portrays atheists. Not every atheist is bitter and cynical, it's all about proof really. Something this movie and the makers fail to understand.The story centers around a college student who challenges his teacher's (Kevin Sorbo) beliefs about god. A devoted Christian, he sets out to prove that god is real. This in turn inspires his classmates to question their beliefs in the process. He also loses his girlfriend only to get another one.While it doesn't seem bad on the paper, how it's presented on screen is a different story. Even if this wasn't a Christian film, It's still terrible movie. The characters are mostly stereotypes that've been done to death such as the abusive Muslim dad, the quiet, obedient straight-A Chinese student, and the main character who's the typical boy next door which's fine but he is also very plain and as much as I like Kevin Sorbo, his role as the one-dimensional antagonist just doesn't cut it. I'm actually concerned that it'll distort people's perception of atheists. In a way, they already have it rough and this only further aggravates it.The songs aren't bad though they're meh and the cameos are unnecessary. Some of the commentary is actually thought provoking and can be sweet but at the same time, I feel like it's a little forced. It's a shame Pureflix decided to release two more sequels to this abomination. That in it of itself is an affront to god. God teaches love and acceptance, something this movie turns its back on.I hate to sound religious but it's true. I have nothing against Christian movies and shows such as veggie tales (in fact I grew up watching it) but this's propaganda that can distort and turn people away rather than unite as the teachings are supposed to do.Whether you're a Christian or not, this isn't the movie for you. I dare say, this's blasphemous in how one-sided it is. I don't have much else to say other than skip it. While it's not bad enough to be condemned, it's enough to shun it."
" Christian-Hating Atheists Responsible For Negative Ratings
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,10,"The negative reviews left by Christian-hating atheists directly parallels the theme of the movie. They're so filled with hate that they took the time to leave unfair ratings of the movie just to bring it down, because they gain satisfaction through hate. It's sad really, because even from a non-religious standpoint, the God's Not Dead movies are pretty good. The arguments presented are always fair, sound, and factual... especially in the second movie, which takes place in a court room. Christian or not, see these movies. They're fantastic and entertaining to say the least."
" The Cringe's Not Dead
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,1,"There is so wrong with this movie, so many cringe-worthy moments from the start to the finish, that I had to pause it and it took me almost 8 hours until I finally managed to finish this atrocity that's labeled as movie - and a movie that had a theatrical release nevertheless. That should be illegal in my opinion.First and foremost, let me say that I have nothing against Christians and Christianity as a community at all. Everybody deserves to believe and worship (or not) what they want, and pushing your ideas down someone else's throat is very unethical and straight up disrespectful.You probably know that this movie is about a philosophy student who refuses to sign at the request of his professor that ""God's Dead"" on the first day of class, and the professor tells him that in the next three weeks he will have 20 minutes at the end of every class to defend his thesis that ""God's Not Dead"".And it is as horrible as it sounds.One thing that bothered me in particular is the fact that they managed to represent an African, a Middle-Eastern, a Chinese and all of them were either existing Christians or converted by the end of the movie.The Muslims are represented in an awful and ugly light which is very misleading and not the reality at all. As a gay man, I've been more accepted and felt more at home when I come out to Muslims than when I do to Christians, because they don't judge as harsh. Yet, here Ayisha's father went bull crazy when he discovered his daughter listening to Christian podcasts, and dragged her outside and kicked her out of the house. The Muslims don't deny the existence of Jesus or have anything against Christianity or Christians at all. Also, the men don't force the women to wear hijabs or burkas either. That's totally up to the woman and I have plenty of Muslim girl friends who don't wear them, and they come from very traditional families.The second thing that bothered me is that every person who doesn't believe in Jesus is automatically presented like the villain and the bad guy, like the philosophy professor and his intellectual friends, and all the Christians are represented as martyrs and the under-dogs, which is not my experience with Christians at all. They are usually the rudest and the loudest people and they always try to enforce their opinion on other people, yet the atheists are presented like this in this one, even though atheist don't believe in god and therefore why would they spend time debating something that according to them doesn't exist, yet alone spend hours of their time to convince others that god never was to begin with?And they way that old lady towards the end told her son that just because he has trouble free life it's from the devil so he can comfortably live in sin - that was just plain ridiculous and it made me laugh almost as much as the claim by the philosophy student that morality can't exist without god and that only Christians have the right moral compass.Overall, this movie was bad from start to finish, a pure propaganda by Christians and people who are so brainwashed that they can't look sideways and see someone else's point of view. The acting is horrible, the editing is okay, but the plot is completely non-existent. I would never recommend this to anyone, and I'm glad I watched it on Netflix because I would never have paid money for this bull."
" Propaganda for Cretins
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,1,"This is such a blatant and obvious attempt at propaganda that even a mentally handicapped person could see this. The writers, if you can call them that, don't even try to be subtle. The arguments for God are something you might expect from a middle schooler. They couldn't even get their own arguments right. Only watch it if you want to lose brain cells."

" Wow
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,1,"This movie is so bad, everyone will hate it, regardless of your race, religion or creed. The premise is obvious, trite, and insults the viewer.

No school would allow that.Utter garbage."

",2020-07-04 00:00:00,2,"This movie does not reflect on the perspectives of many Christians. The arguments are decent from the boy but the movie does its best to portray every non-Christian as evil or unintelligent. This is not the case. I know many intelligent and caring atheists, Muslims, etc. What a horribly written and executed movie."
" SPOILER: The Atheist Hates God.
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,1,"I have 3 confessions to make before I write this review, and I need to make them to set it up: 1)I have not seen this movie in 4-5 years. 2)My thoughts are largely based on reviews and other discussions on the movie. 3)I saw this 4 or 5 times in a year or so after it was released to DVD. I used to love it. And for that...I beg forgiveness.The movie God's Not Dead has numerous plots, and the main one follows Josh Wheaton(Shane Harper), who is a Christian and a college freshman who has to take a philosophy class. His teacher is an atheist named Professor Rattison, who tells his students to write on a sheet of paper: God Is Dead. All of the students do this, except for Josh- who refuses due to his faith.Therefore, Rattison gives Josh an alternative assignment-for the next 3 days, for 20 minutes each, he has to give a presentation that gives evidence for the existence of God. If he can't convince the class that God exists by then, he fails.In a way, the plot is intriguing. Part of the reason why I used to like it is because a faith vs. science controversy(or whatever name you want to give it) is a compelling topic. But how the movie goes about it is cruel, unrealistic, and stupid.First off, the plot. It could never happen. Wikipedia reports that as of 2019, 65% of Americans believe in Christianity. So 6-7 out of 10 Americans would side with Josh. But no, Josh is the only student out of 80 kids that believes in Jesus, let alone a god.Then there is the portrayal of the atheist characters. Every atheist is a jerk in the movie. The professor name-calls God(in one scene he calls Him a ""dictator""), he bullies Josh, and like I said, he will fail Josh if he can't convert 80 atheists to faith in 60 minutes.That goes for other atheist/Non-Christian characters as well. A Muslim beats and kicks out his daughter for becoming a Christian, a businessman neglects seeing his religious mother with dementia, his girlfriend has cancer(which is cured in the NEXT movie after she comes to faith), etc.This movie implies that if you are not a Christian, you're a jerk. I'm sorry to say that, but that IS what is implied;When it comes to Josh's arguments, they're kind of thin. In his 1st argument, he states that the Big Bang could not have happened because then nothing turned into everything, which is impossible.A student points out that Richard Dawkins has stated that if a Christian makes this argument, atheists have the right to ask: ""So who created God?"" Josh gives the correct point that Christians do not believe in a created God-He is eternal.He says that atheists should be asked: ""If the universe created you, then who created the universe?"" I suppose that's fine, but this does not argue for God's existence, and he avoids the students' question and never answers it. And of course this ""Christian"" movie never makes note of that.I don't recall much of what the 2nd debate is about, so to cut to the chase, allow me to skip it and go to the next scene.After the 2nd debate, the professor tells Josh that HE used to believe in God but his mother died of cancer after he prayed for Him to heal her. So he's an atheist because, in his mind- ""if God exists, He would care about my mother and heal her for my sake."" It's normal to feel that way when you are a Christian child(My father died when I was 9 and I remember having those feelings), but God doesn't suddenly not exist because of one tragedy He allowed in your life.Josh uses this for his 3rd debate, and he asks the professor: ""Do you hate God?"" He scoffs at this(as he should) and so Josh asks: ""Okay...WHY do you hate God?"" He hammers him with this question until Rattison snaps: ""Because He took everything from me! Yes, I HATE God! Everything I have towards Him is HATE!""Then Josh, who initiated the question in the first place, asks the professor: ""How can you hate someone who doesn't exist?"" When I was 16, I thought BURN! Now, I think- WELL NO KIDDING! There's the 6th Sense-level plot twist for you- Mr. Rattison isn't really an atheist, he just has a grudge against The Almighty.As thin and convoluted as this argument is, it's what suddenly converts all 80 students to believe in God. The professor doesn't convert however, until he is hit by a car.Can you see the problem God's Not Dead has? It's a hateful, biased, flawed movie with logical fallacies as a side dish. It shouldn't even be considered a ""Christian"" movie. Jesus taught to love our enemies or those we do not agree with. Atheists are included in this matter. And again, I apologize, especially to atheists, for once liking this movie.I could go on a lot longer but you get the point. I was going to re-watch the movie to find my rating, but 1/10 seems to fit, especially since I have analyzed why. I haven't seen it in years and I intend to try to keep the record going.God may not be dead, but if He were, this movie would probably make Him roll in His grave.Note: If you want to see more reviews that helped me open my eyes to how flawed and unlikable God's Not Dead is and should be, I suggest going on YouTube and looking up Say Goodnight Kevin's half-hour review or seeing Josh Keefe's video The Problem With Christian Movies.Reverse Recommendations: If you want some GREAT Christian movies, here's a few I highly recommend to get you started: Silence, Hacksaw Ridge, Francis of Assisi, Soul Surfer, I Can Only Imagine, and I Still Believe. God's Not Dead puts Veggie Tales on par with The Ten Commandments."
" Christian Good, atheist Bad
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,1,Patronizing and insulting to a myriad of beliefs. The film is shallow with little to none redeeming qualities.
" Should Have Been Banned
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,1,Just don't recommend it to your new Believers. Be careful. Watch it yourself carefully first.
" Your right, God's Not Dead, Jesus however, never existed.
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,1,"Sorry to burst you bubble. Or maybe not, actually, I am not sorry at all to be honest with you. The only thing I am sorry about, is you wasting your lives on such a lie. Read Exodus 4:22 and Hosea 13:4 and you'll be free from that spiritual slavery."
" As a former Muslim turned Agnostic, this movie infuriated me.
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,1,"I believe that anyone should believe what they want to believe as long as it doesn't bring harm onto others. The movie claims to share this value but also stops at nothing to paint Atheists, Muslims, etc. as negatively as possible. The self-righteousness of those who made this movie is utterly disgusting. To pass judgement unto those who believe in anything other than what Christians believe in goes directly against the teachings of the Bible.Atheism, Islam, and practically every other belief system is just as legitimate as Christianity. Why? Because NO RELIGION IS FACT. THEY ARE BASED UPON A SET OF BELIEFS THAT CANNOT BE PROVEN OR DISPROVEN. Despite this, however, this movie stops at nothing to try to scientifically argue in favor of Christianity.I'm not here to claim that people can be judged as moral or immoral by what they believe in, because - unless you find good in inherently immoral things such as murder - it is no one's right to make that assumption. Living in Mississippi, most people I know are Christian. Most people I know are also good people, Christian or not. I just take issue with the sense of entitlement shared by some evangelicals. To act like there is only one truly correct belief system and it is your duty to convert the wayward ones who don't believe in it is astronomically condescending.In short, believe in what you want to believe in and don't act like your beliefs are somehow more correct than someone else's. They are beliefs because they can't be proven, so no religion is more right or wrong than another.And yes, Atheism is a religion. There are many other religions out there with no God. However, Agnosticism isn't. Agnosticism is more the choice to not believe in any religion. I follow it because, with the near infinite possibilities of what may happen after we die (including nothing), to me, there is simply no point in spending time on Earth to try to figure it out. It is what it is and me thinking about it won't change anything"
" Great Movie, Must Watch for Everyone
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,10,This movie was very well written and directed. Very entertaining. I've never met anyone who didn't love this movie after watching it. Very enlightening.
" Powerful Movie!
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,10,Just give it 20 minutes. Its a well crafted film with a great deal of challenging thoughts.
" A good job for apologetics
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,8,"Read some of the reviews from both Christians and non and am frankly quite surprised at the very negative reactions. What happened to the American open mind? A dying art? The young student, I thought, gave solid arguments and credible evidence in the presentation of his belief in God. And yes, I agree that although not all atheists, agnostics or non religious folk hate God, there are those who do--as the professor depicted in this film. I have friends like him who because God did not answer their prayers for a terminally ill loved one, have turned against their Creator and, yes, even hate God. So it is not at all far fetched that this professor could have the same reaction to the death and loss of his mother to cancer when he was a young boy. The fact that the young uni student took a great risk in deciding to defend his faith because he felt convicted that God was leading him to do this made one consider the depth of their own commitment. He could so easily have ditched the class or complied with the instructor's request. But like Daniel of old when he faced the Lions Den for worshiping and praying to his God openly, as was his custom, so this young man took the risk to his academic future. Despite family and friends urging him to take the easy way out, he stood firm for his faith with heartening results. Cheesy? I will concede that I did think the scenes with the professor's girlfriend were rather over the top. But the rest of the movie I certainly consider thought provoking and well done."
" Shameful
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,1,"I don't want to take this film too seriously, because it is absolutely ridiculous. This is the kind of ""Faith"" film that gives faith films a bad name. The wide range of stereotypes is like watching a cartoon. The writers and directors should be ashamed of this effort."
" I actually hate this garbage movie.
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,1,"Film is what I use to describe good movies. Apparently that is not what these people are trying to do. I don't like how atheists are portrayed, as if they are Satan himself. God is a loving God and would hate to see the villainization of people he loves."
" Ending Scene Implications
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,3,"Redemption. The ending scene, while meant to convey that there is no time too late to ask for forgiveness and seek acceptance into your heart, struck a chord with me. If any of my brothers in service had questioned God, never been baptized, and sought only to help others then they would be damned until they acted in a way similar to the professor in the movie. However, the professor was given a chance. To my brother's who died instantaneously in the blast of an IED, this movie has told me you are damned. You are damned, but the man who belittled generations of students, verbally abused his wife, and consistently abused his power for gain is saved in the eyes of God. What God, I ask, bases his judgement on the words of ""I accept you"" instead of ""I accept the way you lived your life"". The men I served with were honorable, empathetic, and data-driven. No movie the condemns them bases upon their agnosticism is a true movie of God or ""free will"" that is implied with this movie's theme. This, which was supposed to tie together the theme of movie failed. In doing so, the rest of the trials and tribulations and over exaggerated ""evil"" of the lawyer and other atheistic believers were less impactful because that man can simply ask for forgiveness but if someone inherently good doesn't they are damned.Also, invading the privacy of a man having just died to show a God is Not Dead text is pointless and insincere. Especially from two ""men of God"" such as themselves."
" Sad to see all the negative Reviews.... The movie's message at it's core is wonderful
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,"Reading thru the reviews - most people who have rated this movie a 1 or just poorly did so because they are also trying to slam Christianity. The movie fairly portrays the difficulty Christians have in a ""progressive"" culture and society.... for proof - just wait until the end of the movie and read the long list of court cases that Christians and Christian groups have successfully litigated against schools, universities, and other organizations that routinely show outrageous bias, prejudice, and essentially ""prosecutorial"" behavior against Christians. Granted - the whole thing with the duck dynasty guy the way it is thrown into the movie seems Cheesy, as does the car scenes with the two pastors trying to get to Disney World. BUT - the core message is wonderful! If you are a Christian, WATCH the movie - it is wonderful. If you are wondering about God - watch the movie - it will help you. If you are not a Christian... again, watch the movie. It makes the truth very clear - This life will pass away for every single one of us eventually - and then what? If you think you just cease to exist - you better hope you are right, because if you're wrong, you will be wrong for the remainder of eternity and you will be doomed."
" Loved the movie
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,Imagine being offended by a movie. Loved the story and acting.
" Christian propaganda at its finest
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,2,"This has to be one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. The scene that really pissed me off is the scene where an atheist dies and people try to convince him that God did him a favor. I think that this scene pretty much summarizes the film, everyone who is not a Christian is a bad person according to this movie."
" Wonderful and amazing
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,10,I learned alot as well as enjoyed. The intertwined lives was interesting and made it good.
" A needed film for today
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"This film is a word of caution for all our students attending college, they are being pulled away from God because we have allowed our professors to teach them what to think and not how to think. The concept should be a wake up call, but sadly nothing has changed. Certainly worth watching, ending is powerful."
" Appreciated at First
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,3,"I appreciate what this movie is attempting to do, although I am no longer a Christian and find the Christian aspects heavy handed (even though I went in knowing the target audience). The movie feels more like a Newsboys commercial than a film, and the logic used in the triumphant moment by the main character makes little to no sense after some serious thought.Don't bother watching, there are much better Christian themed movies with more cohesive plots - like every Veggie Tales movie."
" Slightly dramatic
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,7,All I see is negative reviews about the movie and how cheesy it was although I feel as if they are not looking at the true message. I am a Christian so I guess it's biased based opinion. I truly love this movie and I do not feel that since the movie was quite cheesy that it should be slammed as hard as it has been.
" Fantastic
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,10,"Just a great, Christian flick. Highly recommend. It has great values, teachings and of course the gospel.It's better than the sequels and one of my all time favorites."
" I Like This Movie In My Opinion, and It Is Worth Watching It!
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie is great! The song they played was great! God is good, all the time, and all the time, God is good!The movie shows a debate between the Professor and a student.Very great movie to watch!Some might not like it because of certain views they have towards religion, or some other reasons involving religion. Other times, it may have been a drag to them.If you want to watch a movie, and you want to know why God's not Dead, then watch this."
" Not for Everyone
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,4,As a sort of rallying cry for Christians to go public with their faith and be willing to defend it -its good. As art -it's bad. As a tool for evelgelism -its a disaster.
" Yet another lame religious movie
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,1,"Christian cinema - much like Christian music and Christian literature - is, without exception, terrible. In addition to the crude production values and mediocre acting, the films suffer from extreme preachiness and self-righteousness. I should mention here that I am not, nor ever have been, a christian. This film has nothing to distinguish it from the garbage heap of similar movies. In it, a self-righteous, arrogant loser decides that he is being persecuted, and proceeds to argue a large number of logical fallacies (the screenwriter obviously has no understanding of the burden of proof) with an assortment of vaguely offensive stereotypes. The only reason I watched this is because I consider myself something of an expert on bad movies, and this one is definitely bad. Unfortunately, like a every other religious movie, there's nothing particularly entertaining about it, so people like me who are looking for something in the so-bad-it's-good category should give it a wide berth, as should everyone else, because it's really boring and preachy. I suppose it demonstrates that fanatics can't make good movies, and that 'family friendly' is a code word for boring; but I can't think of any other use for it. Good thing it only cost me a dollar at the thrift store, because I burnt my copy after watching it."
" One sided view of religion!!! Maybe intentionally but Very offensive
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,4,"After watching this ,i had to make a review for this movie because i believe this is not how directors should deal with topics like that , it was obviously one sided !! I was hoping that it deals with the topic in a broad way, no affiliation should be displayed but unfortunately that's what happened, i was hoping for amazing dialogues between the believer and non-believer / between science and religions in a general term , however in this movie you have the feeling that the director is trying to say to everyone that christianity is the best religion in the world and other religions should all be eliminated!! And not only that the gave a stereotype image of atheists and that they all become atheists because God didn't help them or killed someone they loved !! This is not true , some of them yes , they may have that reason but not all of them , and also the muslim father Who forcing his daughter to follow certain attitude ! This is totally wrong! What the points of showing that the girl converted to christianity ? You wanna show that she abundant the wrong religion (islam) and converted the only right one !!! Is that the message!!!!! I am a Muslim but i believe that all religions are similar with minor differences! They all have the same objectives!! Is to worship the God who we all believe created this whole universe! But this movie is trying to favor christianity over all other religions! Movie maker when making a movie should take into consideration that viewers have different backgrounds and different beliefs!! U shouldn't offend anyone!"
" The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,1,"God's Not Dead is a hateful, bitter and such a unpleasant film. Its a film that is a hate letter to all those who dont have the same views as the filmmakers. In other words its a hate letter to atheists and Muslims. The film has several story lines that are connected. The main plot is about a college freshman named Josh Wheaton who enrolls in a philosophy class and is told to write by Professor Radisson that God does not exist on a sheet of paper. Granted this would not happen in real life because Professor Radisson would be fired. Radisson challenges Josh to a series of debates that just waste all the students time to prove that God exists. The worst point comes in the last debate when Josh says there is no reason to be moral if there is no God. So Josh is a sociopath? If Josh did not have his faith he would do horrible things? That right there makes Josh a very unlikable character. Other plots involve Professor Radissons girlfriend who he insults and makes her feel low at a party full of atheists. The atheists in this film are all portrayed as stereotypes who are all very unpleasant. Another has a forighen student arguing with his father on the existence of God. Another involves a young woman who is a liberal atheist who has cancer. She is later dumped on the spot by her lawyer boyfriend but finds faith but a band called The News Boys who are heavily advertised in the film. Another plot involves two pastors trying to get to an amusement park and another involves the lawyer and Radissons girlfriends mom who has dementia. Now the last plot involves a girl who is supposed to be a Muslim (who only wears a hijab and nothing else) and her strict father who abuses her and throws her out of the house when he finds out she is really a Christian. Its a crazy scene. Its trying to show Muslims as bad even though this kinda thing happens in all religions. The film goes on through a series of debates with Josh and Radisson. Its really just scenes of preachy straw men arguments that ends up with the students takes the side of Josh. It all ends up at a Newsboys concert in which a character gets run over and dies but since he repented before he died one of the pastors says its a good day right after he watched a guy die right in front of him! On top of everything else the film ends stating court cases were this film was based. They were mostly just unpopular pinions given by students and not persecution by religion. Gods Not Dead is a horrible film. The film is a mess. A very mean spirited mess of hate. Its the worst movie I have ever seen because of that."
" One of the worse movie Experiences
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,1,"I was looking to look for something spiritual but this is an evangelical hate preaching movie . It depicted other religions and atheist as being backward and pointing Jesus as the ONLY spiritual guide to heaven .
Being a learned person its funny that those who even believe in this cannot answer simple question on the authorship of the Gospels and infringe and the authorsips of gospels of Mark , Peter , Luke and Paul is something entirely different . PLEASE do your research on authenticity of your religion before portrarying stereotypes of other religion . Was looking for actually a good spiritual movie through Christians ."
" It only shows the good sides the Christianity, the bad sides of Islam and get's Atheists completely wrong
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,1,"I don't mind if religious people want to make a religious movie. I'm not religious and I even like Dreamworks's ""The Prince of Egypt"" and I'm interested in seeing 1956's ""The Ten Commandments"" The Bible does have some interesting stories in it whether you believe in them or not, now onto the review.I don't mind if religious people want to make a religious movie but this is literally propaganda and it gets a lot of stuff wrong. The ""Atheist"" in the movie was mad at God. ...Atheists don't believe in God, that would be like someone hating The Joker from Batman for bad stuff happening in real life.A Muslim girl also gets kicked out of her house for converting to Christianity. They show a negative side to Islam but not to Christianity. How many people have been kicked out of Christian homes for being LGBT or simply converting to a different religion or dropping religion entirely? I know not all Christians kick their de-converted kids out but I'm sure that a lot of Muslim parents also don't kick their kids out over de-converting.You might ask ""why did I watch this?"" This came out when I was in High School and my parents rented it, I also hadn't fully de-converted yet."
" Hateful and mean spirited movie mascarading as christian values (spoiler there are no values of any kind in this movie)
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,1,This is such a terrible hateful movie. Of course the atheist is evil and actively persecuting christians because that's the only thing that could ever make sense. How freaking simplistic. No diversity is allowed because Christianity is always right. How dare anyone else have any other religion? Even the Muslim woman converts to Christianity in the end. The atheist also does but he's killed off for dramatic effect. Yay! Now everyone is Christian and the non-believer is dead! What a great wholesome family movie.
" Contemptible propaganda that actually makes Christians look evil!
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,2,"Many films and art projects have some political or religious bias one way or another. There is a line of extreme bias, however, beyond which a project becomes a blatant piece of propaganda.Sadly, ""God's Not Dead"" doesn't so much cross this line as screech over it gleefully at 200 mph and start doing handbrake turns on the grass (probably over a flattened atheist college Professor).Shane Harper is student Josh Wheaton, enrolled in a Philosophy course taught by Professor Jeffery Radisson (Kevin Sorbo).Josh is a Christian student, Jeff is an atheist. Confrontation ensues.Now, in my real life experience of academia, University staff tend to be made up of people of very expansive cultural and religious backgrounds. They all usually have one thing in common too - a smart and sensitive tolerance of others' religious beliefs, whether they are atheists or not.Not so much in the one-dimensional pro-religion world of God's Not Dead, in which Prof. Radisson is an ignorant, selfish and ruthless ass who maniacally hates everything religious and doesn't seem to actually teach his students anything of note. Instead he just gets up on a pedestal and rants at his students about his own beliefs like a borderline lunatic.To be fair, Sorbo's acting is pretty reasonable. He's just portraying a character who is a completely simplistic evil strawman of atheists and thus he can't do anything to make the character a fair representation or likeable.Jeffrey makes blatantly terrible and facetious arguments in order to get smugly countered by our ""hero"" Josh over and over again and give those darn atheists a drubbin'. Of course it turns out he's just a scared coward who is afraid of believing in God, because apparently all atheists are just terrified little crybabies, not intelligent grown adults who simply don't believe in Christianity.Perhaps the worst part of the movie is the scene where Jeff is literally mown down by a car and killed in a brutal hit and run accident.Instead of this being depicted as the horrific incident that it is, instead we have a blubbering Jeff dying in the arms of an incredibly smug Christian (who is grinning, *GRINNING* at this!) as he renounces his atheism and defeatedly admits he was completely wrong about everything.This of course gives an excellent opportunity for the grinning zealot to dryly comment that Jeff will ""know more about God than any of us"" in a moment, having been coerced...err, sorry, ""convinced"" into joining the religion in his dying moments of terror.That is one amazing property of this film - despite the extreme Christian bias, it makes Christians look like cruel jerks. Josh is a smug know-it-all who slices Jeff to pieces effortlessly in every debate, even shouting at him on several occasions. Never does he doubt his philosophy or show humility, he's just right all the time...and boy does he know it.Similarly, a man's tragic death is instead treated like a great unbeliever being fatefully murdered by God's...compassionate (?!) wrath, and his God Squad getting another +1 before he shuffles off this mortal coil. Boom, another victory for Christendom!In short, the film is tasteless, pretty mindless and extremely biased. If I were a devout Christian I would actually be embarrassed by how it portrays the faithful."
" The exact brand of delusion you'd expect from a Christian film...
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,1,"God's Not Dead suffers from the same plot issues as so many other Christian films. Namely, it's such a ridiculous stretch to make middle class American Christians seem like the persecuted underdogs that the ""villains"" of the story have to say or do insane things that no real person would ever say or do. In this particular case, an atheist (cue boos and hisses from this movie's target audience) philosophy professor requires students to acknowledge that there is no God in order to pass his class. I've personally taken multiple philosophy classes at an ""evil"" secular university. Not once were any students' grades impacted by not renouncing their beliefs. This is clearly a college movie written by people who have never even set foot on a college campus, much less in a college classroom. Christian filmmakers DESPERATELY want to portray themselves as the ones BEING persecuted. To that I say, ask groups like atheists, the LGBTQ community, and members of other religions which side the persecution is really coming from. Do your intelligence a favor and skip this feature length victim complex fantasy..."
" Faith based movies are not dead!
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,10,"Excellent movie! Done well, thought provoking and in line with scripture."
" Could be better
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,5,"I feel like the movie could've done better but even as a Christian, now that I think about it the story isn't as well developed. If the goal was to try to convince others to believe that God exists intellectually , through evidence, I don't think it did a very good job of that. There were much more venues they could've explored and really tackled the issue and idea of atheism more realistically and deal with it there. Sometimes you have to go from the head to heart and it felt like it went to heart too quick without addressing the evidence and reasons to believe in God better."
" I don't know what to make of this
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,4,"So you believe in a higher power or you don't. Why make this a battle? I have never understood this on-going argument between Atheist and Christians. It seems to me that ironically both sides end up becoming what they are arguing against. Now, making a movie about this argument is just making this even more complicated. I could see a movie like this working if only it was made by someone that is not bias on the subject.Maybe the film should of focused more on the act of disobedience of the student. Nobody should be forced to write about something that goes against your religious beliefs. That aspect, I like.There is better Christian movies out there. Don't get turned off by this one if you are exploring the genre."
" Burn this
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,1,"As a Christian myself I know what's right from wrong. I admit I have sinned plenty of times in this life too. But that was my choice. When it came to religion, I always see it as a choice. But when I see this poor excuse for a Christian film, It is telling me that I should consider Atheists and Non-Religious people as an enemy of God and they should be forced to believe in him. But we forget that by doing this we are only condemning ourselves.I have met many people in this world, religious and not. Many of them Good and many Bad, that's life. And some people who were Non-religious have even teased me for my beliefs at school. But I never hated them for it, only pity. And I accepted that it was their choice not to believe and I left well enough alone. But the last thing I'd ever think of doing was forcing them into submitting to the word of God as if I was some Holy Dictator. Because I always saw God and Christianity as a religion of peace, harmony, freedom and acceptance, not of enslavement, fanaticism or dominancy.In the end Man makes a choice, for good or for evil. You can either accept it or despise it. But it is mankind's right, everyone of us. To choose to sin, or whether there is a God in this world or not. But for me, I believe there is one.Gods not Dead is not a film about true Christianity, it is a film that asks us to betray ourselves and become the very people it dictates against from living their lives the way they wish to lead. If God himself has seen this film the way I have, he would be weeping down from heaven at this moment in time."
" One of the most hateful movies I've seen in years.
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,1,"It's taken me a long time to write this. I've seen most of David A.R. White's movies and I think he's a nice and genuine kind of guy. But when he comes out with stuff like this I seriously need to reconsider my opinion of him.The main story is of a young Christian man who goes to college and his evil atheist professor forces him to defend his faith. It's kinda like that old e-mail that was making the rounds back in the 90's namely, ""It takes GUTS to stand up for Jesus"". Long story short evil atheist professor asks at the start of the semester whether anybody believes in God. He's done this every year and every year when somebody does he'd yell at them and ""prove"" God's non-existence by dropping a piece of chalk and saying that if God was real he could stop it from breaking. Well in all the times he did it, the chalk broke every time. Except this time when through a series of impossible events the chalk hits the ground without breaking. Humiliated he runs out of the class and the student in question then preaches for the next hour and brings the class to God and end scene.Throughout it all we're shown that anybody who's a Christian is a good and decent person. And anybody that isn't an atheist is cold and evil to the point of ridiculousness. Dean Cain, an atheist not only gets upset with his mother who has dementia because he knows she won't remember it in five minutes also dumps his atheist girlfriend when she gets cancer because ""she broke the deal"". Or the muslim father who beats his daughter for listening to Christian music and sermons on her iPod and then kicks her out of the house. Or Dean Cain's girlfriend with cancer is of course herself an atheist and she sets up to ambush interview one of the Duck Dynasty stars. She's also a vegetarian. I don't know if that adds or takes away from her character or not. And at the center of it all is Kevin Sorbo as the evil atheist professor.But Ksorbs isn't actually an atheist. He just hates God. Seriously, that's a plot point later on. His Mother died when he was younger and for that he hates God. And last time I checked atheism is when you don't believe in something. So how can you hate something that you don't believe in? You can't. This means that he's not, and never was, an atheist. In that, he's more of a strawman of what hardcore Christians think an atheist is.This guy is just over the top evil in this. First forcing the poor Christian student to defend his faith and then threatening him in private once he's made some apparently ""good points"" in class.Of course at the end, like all of these things including the e-mail, everybody stands up and applauds because they too are now Christian. And they all go to a Newsboys concert. Don't ask me why but I guess they're popular in Christian circles.Like a lot of Christian movies this takes the tried and true method of preaching to the already converted. It doesn't change hearts or minds and in my opinion this is what Christians should be focusing on assuming it's their intention in the first place.If you want to see one of these movies that actually feels like a real movie with real people, try the third one. Avoid this one like the plague."
" Pandering, Offensive Propaganda. This is not a movie
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,1,"If you think ""God's Not Dead"" is good then here are some reasons on why you're wrong.I just want to note that if you're Christian and you agree with everything this movie says then good for you but I won't praise a movie just for promoting Christianity. My review/take isn't intended to insult Christianity or any religious beliefs for that matter but it's just me taking a critical look at this film for what it really is.This isn't a movie, it's religious propaganda. No matter what my personal beliefs are, making a 2-hour movie meant to brainwash the audience is insulting. Christians deserve a better movie than this. This is 100% just pandering to Christians, insulting to Muslims, and honestly, I think this 'movie' was made to change the mind of atheists which if they saw this; they'd laugh.It'd be more interesting if this 'movie' were to tackle complicated issues with Christianity like homosexuality or abortion but it doesn't. Or if that example is too controversial for a movie then they could've at least shown a complicated character with mixed emotions on what to feel about religion then maybe the atheists watching this could latch onto that character and go through what that character goes through BUT NO.Which leads me to my next point. The one atheist in this movie is cruel, narcissistic and depressed while everyone else that is religious is happy. The movie fails to address the fact that the bad guy (the atheist) is bad because of his dark past. -Not all atheists are trying to shove an agenda down your throat (unlike this propaganda) and this might shock the makers of this movie but there are atheists out there that are genuinely good people. The 'movie' isn't trying to be smart, the movie isn't raising any questions but the movie is TELLING you how to feel.The script is bad, the editing is bad, the characters are bad. Oh, and the acting is so bad that I laughed at parts that were supposed to be dramatic.The only plot line that I liked was with the Muslim girl but even that is barely developed and the execution is TERRIBLE."
" Bad Christian propaganda
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,3,"Intead of developing its characters and bringing us interesting reflexions, God's not dead is worried on bringing bad christian propaganda and based on stereotypes.

" Creation vs Evolution
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,6,"A movie which focuses about a college student stands firmly for God, the professor wanted all the students to write on a paper God's dead to renounce the existence of God but Josh stands faithful to Christ and challenge the arrogant professor in a debate during the class session proving the existence of God."
" God is not dead!

" ""They get to choose.""
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,7,"Say what you will about the propaganda value this film has for true believers, but the essential question about the existence or non-existence of a Supreme Being will never be competently answered by mere mortals like ourselves. What it all comes down to is a matter of faith, and no pronouncements from any of the accepted scholars of our time like Stephen Hawking will make a wit of difference. In it's portrayal of Christians and atheists, I did think the story line was pretty one-sided, so when Josh (Shane Harper) 'won' his argument against Professor Radisson (Kevin Sorbo), I didn't think it was very realistic that everyone in the class would stand up in support. The multiple story lines, some of which were left hanging, didn't do a lot to advance the core argument that 'God's Not Dead', even if it looked like Josh scored a home run when he challenged Radisson about hating an entity that he didn't believe in. The main idea surviving the picture is that each and every person gets to choose or decide for him/herself what they wish to believe. Beyond that, the feel-good aspect of the story reverts back to those who have faith and live it in their daily lives."
" Full of stereotypes
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,1,"First, off this movie might look diverse but it's full of negative stereotypes. There's one of a Muslim family ,and then the girl converts to Christianity & her Muslim father beats her. Then this film plays off the stupid idea/stereotype that college professors are trying to convince their students to be atheist and then there's a Chinese character who's almost never really heard of God except for a women getting in trouble for preaching to a group of people. the reporter is shown as somebody who's ""trying to stomp out God at all cost"" It portrays America as being totally against Christianity, which isn't true because a lot of people are still Christian. The professor dies from getting hit by a car & then the movie ends with a concert as if somebody didn't just die right outside. Disgusting. Also, too much going on at one time, no character or plot development. Straight propaganda that tries to prey on emotions."
" Are They Seriously Expecting Us To Be Touched By This!?
",2018-10-10 00:00:00,2,"Ok so I saw this film a while back, but I still would have to say this film greatly offended me. So I interpreted the message of the film to be ""If you don't accept Jesus as your lord and savior, you're going to hell!"" And the ending was by far the worst! The main ""villain"" (pretty much a villain to the audience because he's an atheist) revealed why he hated God but decided later to turn his life around only to get hit by a car and die, but he accepted Jesus before he died of his injuries. That's the part that made me mad! I do not recommend this film to even die hard Christians! It was God awful (no pun intended)!"
" Disrespectful, Unloving, Unapologetically Stupid.
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,1,"!Rant Warning! 
 
 Ok, let me first say ...I can kind of agree with some of what these ridiculous movies project. But this movie ...I mean, to depict God as someone who needs to be defended, to depict Christians as perfect people, and to generalize all atheists as bigots ...just doesn't make any sense from a biblical perspective. God is sovereign, Christians (and all other people) are imperfect, not all unbelievers are blatant douchebags. So with that said, here's my question to the director, producers, and distributors of this film: Where is the love, respect, and compassion that Christians are to have for the lost? Where is the love, respect, and honor that we are to have for our God?
 
 Sure, most atheists who dislike Christianity dislike it because of a bad experience they had with the church or with (a) Christian(s). But that's the problem isn't it? Their understanding of Christ is further muddied because they're taught that Christians have no respect for anyone outside of the faith. Is it not our job as Christians to represent Christ to the world? Are we not to be without excuse when our accusers accuse us? Christ was patient, Christ was kind, He was not envious, He did not boast, Christ was not proud. Christ wasn't rude, He wasn't self-seeking, and wasn't easily angered. So what makes us think we're to be any different? 
 
 Personally, I'm angry that my Heavenly Father is disrespected and His grace cheapened by men of the cloth who make these kinds of media forms, who claim that they have knowledge and understanding of God and scripture, yet show by their work that they are more interested in driving away more unbelievers from the truth, while teaching believers false propaganda that encourages them to be unsociable, hateful, narcissistic, bullies. I mean, sure, all believers are at different stages of their walk, but should we not all have and exhibit the base foundation of those basic characteristics of Christ? Should the immature in Christ not display Christian love simply because they're immature? Of course not!
 
 Stop giving us this plastic gospel and give us the real thing, for heaven's sake! Take off the safety jacket, PureFlix, please! Show the real gospel; real scripture in it's real context. Give us real people; real believers, real unbelievers; depict them in real situations, with real struggles, with real needs, and with real heart felt pain and love. Show us what a true and false conversion looks like. Show the world the joy of following Jesus and putting sin to death. Or, stop making big budget flops that mock the gospel and make a fool out of Christ."

" Forgive Them
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,10,"In reading a lot of the reviews, it seems there are so many with hardened hearts and lack a true understanding of what the movie was really about. So many are quick to criticize, as if they're perfect. However, no one is perfect. Jesus said, ""Let he who is without sin, cast the first stone."" The fact is, without the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross and His subsequent resurrection, there is no hope. None of us are worthy of heaven on our own. Without God's word, there is no morality, other than what man decides for himself in the moment. This is why so many reject God's word, and live such perverse and immoral lives. This many not be a perfect movie, but then again none of us are perfect. It was a very good movie, and the arguments presented for the existence of God were solid, but also from the perspective of a college freshman."
" Interesting movie

Avoid."
" Christian propaganda
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,3,"After watching this propaganda, I have come to realise that atheists are not people who don't believe in the existence of God, it just means people who don't believe in the Christian version of God. There was a Muslim girl in the movie, so I thought there was going to be an exploration of various beliefs, but nope. I watched this movie to see what arguments could be given to convince others of the existence of God, like perhaps personal experience or divine daily guidance, but nope, it was a lot of quoting of Darwin, Stephen Hawking and other scientists and philosophers, as if thinking and doing mathematics in itself constitutes proof. Anyway, this movie does not encourage one to think or to question. When you get to the end, you realise this was one big preachfest, where the whole class of atheists suddenly believe in God and ""accepts Jesus"", not because they had an experience or communication with God or Jesus, but just because one student said so. I can't even remember what he said, I fell asleep so many times.Comedic moments: A Muslim girl covers her face, but the moment she steps out of the car, she is dressed in tight, figure-hugging clothes. LOL! Then there was the Chinese international student who phones home to his father. The son speaks Cantonese while the father speaks a heavily-accented Mandarin (obviously from two regions very far apart). The producers can't even be arsed to find out what people of other religions and cultures wear and speak, they are just hell-bent on getting to the final Christian worship/concert. Well, that was a complete waste of time."

" Missed Opportunity and Terrible Portrayal.
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,2,"While I do appreciate what this film tried to achieve, it failed miserably because of poor expression and inaccurate portrayal. Definitely a missed opportunity and a lost potential.In simple words, the movie is very bad. The acting is terrible. The script is weak. The sound score is messy and annoying, it's all over the place. The details of which many are somewhat inaccurate. And worst of all, the film itself is a piece of misunderstood Christian propaganda, most likely by the dumbing down of Americans. I felt like this movie was an insult to Christians, Muslims, and Atheists alike. Quite ignorant, ridiculous, and naive if you ask me. Spreads confusion than light.Most of all, I did not appreciate the negative and inaccurate portrayal of Islam in this film. Typical. How about I quickly run down through a few known facts that this movie missed?~ The Head Scarf - This is one of the biggest misconceptions around the internet and western understanding. The headscarf, also known as hijab/mandeel, is NOT forced onto women of the faith, nor do their spouses or fathers have any say in the matter. Just as Jewish women and Christian Nuns wear them also, so do women of Islam, for God only, not for anyone else. It is an independent choice that the women commit to, out of love and respect to God. Any exceptions or anything contrary to this, would be solely political or cultural gain. Leave the religion(s) out of this.~ The Apostate - This is another questionable one, as it is moving backwards. For a Muslim to convert to Christianity, is as backwards as a Christian converting to Judaism. It is degrading, literally, as you go from the final build, to the previous beta, to the to the first alpha. Keep in mind that while the Torah is known for being the Old Testament, and the Gospel/Bible being the new testament, the Quran is known and considered to be the Final Testament, of the Abrahamic Faith.~ The 'Other' Religion - Though the words 'Islam' and 'Muslim' have been avoided in the film, they're strongly implied and pointed towards. Not to mention, the portrayal of this faith under a negative and ignorant perspective. Let's make something clear for those who don't know any better, shall we? In the Abrahamic Faith all the prophets of God, starting from Adam and ending with Muhammad, are considered MUSLIMS. By definition, 'ISLAM' literally translates to 'SUBMISSION.' And the word 'Muslim' literally translates to 'The Submitted' (to God that is). As such, we know from the Torah, the Bible, and the Quran that all the prophets submitted themselves to God as they all prayed to Him and were his most loyal servants and messengers.I think this will do from me, I'm sure others have a lot more to say."
" Love love love it!

" Most sinful
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,2,"Before I begin the review, let me disclose that I am agnostic (not Christian, and probably partially atheist) so despite my best efforts, I might be just a little bit biased. That being said,this is one of the dumbest films I've ever had the displeasure of watching. No teacher who does the things that the main antagonist does would ever be allowed to be a university professor due to the Establishment Clause. All of our protagonist's arguments for the existence of God are completely nonsensical and can be debunked by simple rational thought. All of the subplots are almost worthless and add nothing to the story. The acting and writing are beyond terrible. And to top it off, this film subscribes to the insane notion that Christianity, the world's leading religion, with over 2.2 billion followers, is somehow under attack. The only good things I can say about the film are that the cinematography, directing, and editing are decent and the score, minus the song at the end, is at least passable. However, these don't even come close to redeeming this film. If there is a loving God,then the people who made this film deserve to burn in the fires of hell for all eternity."
" Shameless Christian Propaganda
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,1,"This movie is bad, really bad actually. Never in my life had I watched a movie that left a bad taste in my mouth afterward. This movie has some of the most immature and stereotypical portrayals of any thing other than Christianity that made it look like they made the characters off their respective extremist subreddits. Atheists are condescending assholes that bash anyone that isn't an atheist. The journalist is stupid and immature giving them a perfect opportunity for them to pull the ""GOD HEALS YOUR LIFE THREATENING ILLNESS!"" moment that is everywhere in Christian media. Not to mention they throw Islam in and make the father a control freak who slaps his daughter around and disowns her making it easily the most disgusting generalization of Muslims as many are accepting people. By now you should notice the pattern that any character in this film that's not a Christian is an amoral sociopath that will abuse you if you're a Christian. The worst part is that classic phrase of repetition to brainwash you into texting your family and friends as if the movie already didn't numb your mind up to begin with. ""God's not dead"" This movie is the perfect example of what propaganda is, and as a Christian myself I apologize for how whiny and immature my people have become thanks to this film."
" It's a Good Movie
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,8,"This movie is great with some inspirational lines in its script. I believe different people have different perspectives to this movie - it's only natural atheists and the like would likely support Radisson and rate the movie as implicative of writing off people who don't believe in God; whilst Christians would see this movie as an apologia.On the bright side of my 8/10 rating, the message of the plot is simple and clear: a lone Christian student defending his faith in God against his atheist lecturer and in the presence of others who, perhaps are halting between opinions of the existence, or otherwise nonexistence of God. It's symbolic of very few true and faithful Christians in the world today ready to give up their lives for the gospel.
The actors did a good jobOn the other hand, the movie's short of my 2-star rating, firstly because of some unrelated, perhaps unfinished subplots. What happened to Ayisha who converted to Christianity after being disowned? Or, the lady with cancer: was she healed, or did she die like the professor? Speaking of the professor, I totally disagree with his demise in the movie. It's more like a tragedy to me because he died, and for it, I was almost indifferent for the remainder of the movie. There are other situations that could lead to his conversion but by an accident and resulting death. The healing of Amy after she was written off as slowly ebbing away can do it, in addition to the convicting impact already made by the freshman.
Thirdly, I disagree with the flat-out compliance by 99.9% of the class to renounce their faith for cheap passmark. Unless that city is a hometown of atheists, I don't understand why there was nobody else to stand by Wheaton in not writing the ""god is dead"" thing, even if they don't voice it out.Beyond these minor flaws, it is a great movie. I bet the producers don't realize the how convicting some lines in the script were. One of my favorite was: ""Sometimes the devil allows people to live a life free of trouble because he doesn't want them turning to God"" by Mina's mother. It includes some great points for the defense of Christianity."
" Great movie. Why do ppl hate it?
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,9,"This was a great movie, and I don't see why people hate it. It's about a proud Christian kid standing up for his religious beliefs, even in a hardcore secular environment.
I didn't like the ending so much: it felt too rushed, sudden, and choppy. But overall it was a great movie."
" This kind of theism is a cultural poison.
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,1,"I would like to start by saying that I couldn't give less of a shit about religion. It's just not a part of my life. I don't call myself an atheist, I just don't like religion. With that out of the way, this movie is so horrifically offensive to anyone who isn't a straight, white Christian. Christian movies seem to follow the pattern of having a non-believer, or someone from a different religion. The whole point of the movie is the conversion of that person to Christianity. That's bad enough as it is, but what this movie does is so much worse. The movie paints anyone who isn't Christian as a horrible person with massive flaws in their character. And to make it even more insulting, one of the underlying messages of the movie is to let people believe what they want. So the message of the movie ends up being ""It's ok to believe what you want, and shove those beliefs down people's throats, but only if you're a Christian. And if you're not a Christian you're a horrible person."" I gave this movie a chance, and I went in thinking ""Well I may not like the message, but it may be a well put together movie."" I was so, so wrong. It has a blatant message that is insulting to the 2/3rds of people on earth who aren't Christian, and it's not even a well made movie. There's not subtlety. It relies on basic cliches and stereotypes. The quality and acting are something similar to a feature length porno.This is just a bad movie. It's technically bad, and insults the audience. This kind of propaganda is why people are becoming more and more fed up with American Christianity. I have no problems with Christians, but this kind of shit is destroying the image of all religion. Please, don't support this movie. If they keep making money, they'll just keep making more shit-shows of insulting Christian superiority."
" Reeks with Christian Arrogance
",2017-12-05 00:00:00,1,"(Spoiler alert) In this movie, a Christian college student is required to prove the existence of his god in a philosophy class, or risk failing the course, because the professor has declared that his god is dead. The student basically accepts the theories of evolution and the Big Bang, but insists that there must be a god since science doesn't explain everything. He also claims that religion is necessary for morality (no secular counterargument is offered). In the end, his goal is to get the professor to allow students to decide the existence of their god for themselves.While I support the idea of being free to decide whether to believe in a god or not, the rest of the plot line of this movie is loaded with Christian arrogance. A Moslem woman gets kicked out of her home by her father for being a secret Christian without any discussion, a unlikely scenario. The father is simply portrayed a rigid and intolerant. The Christian minister she's been listening to is Franklin Graham. The fact that Graham is a rabid Islamophobe is never mentioned.Meanwhile, an atheist blog reporter learns she has advanced stage cancer. Her boyfriend heartlessly abandons her when she tells him about her condition. She is portrayed as all alone with no friends until she tells some Christian rock singers she came to interview about her diagnosis. They convince her to ""accept Jesus."" Finally, when pressed by the student, the philosophy professor admits he became an atheist because of the death of his Christian mother from cancer, as if people lose their religion only due to traumatic events. As he is having second thoughts about his atheism and is on his way to the Christian rock concert, where all the new Christians appear to be heading, including a Chinese student who became a Christian against his father's wishes, the professor is struck by a hit-and-run driver. A Christian minister on the scene convinces the professor to become a Christian on his deathbed.The message of the movie seems to be that once people ""learn about Jesus"" or in times of crisis, they'll become Christian and never again question the existence of the Christian god. (But only it they're Moslems or atheists. If the movie had shown a Jew converting to Christianity, it would've been branded as anti-Semitic and set off a firestorm.)The fact is more and more people are becoming nonbelievers. This is due to the availability of information on the internet that questions Christianity as well as other religions. The huge growth is not due to traumatic events. Some Christians (not all) feel that they're under siege because their beliefs are being questioned, and they're losing the dominance they once had. They don't like the idea that intolerance to non-Christians as well as LGBT individuals is now frowned upon.""God's Not Dead"" is obviously a movie made by Christians for Christians."
" What I Need to Know Before Watching a Movie
",2017-11-17 00:00:00,2,"Once I have decided to watch a movie, there is only one piece of information I want to know in advance, which is when the movie was made, because that provides the context that might be needed to appreciate the movie and understand it. Of course, I already have other pieces of information in advance, such as the title, but basically, I like to watch the movie without having any more advance knowledge than necessary.There is, additionally, my reason for selecting the movie for viewing. In particular, I recently decided to watch movies that featured an atheist as a prominent character, in order to see how the treatment of atheism has evolved in a hundred years of American cinema. Naturally enough, ""God's Not Dead"" (2014) was on my list.Normally, when I review a movie, it is neither necessary nor desirable to talk about myself. But this calls for an exception. I majored in philosophy in the late 1960s, and my favorite philosopher was Friedrich Nietzsche, who was the one who originally said, ""God is dead."" Needless to say, I was an atheist and have been ever since, although now my favorite philosopher is Arthur Schopenhauer.The movie is set on a college campus. Josh Wheaton is a freshman. (I wonder how long it will be before we start designating first-year college students as ""freshpersons."") He signs up for an introductory course in philosophy. He is warned by another student not to take the course from Professor Radisson, but he is undeterred. During the first class, Radisson says he doesn't want to waste time debating the existence of God, so he demands that every student in the class write ""God is dead"" on a piece of paper and sign it. Josh refuses to sign it. I must admit, Nietzschean atheist though I was, I wouldn't have signed it either, but for very different reasons.Radisson tells Josh that for twenty minutes in the next three classes, he will have to defend the proposition that God exists, with the implication that if he fails in this endeavor, he will flunk the course. On the first day that he has to defend his belief that God is not dead, Josh essentially advances the cosmological argument for the existence of God, which is that an eternally existing God is needed to explain how a contingent world arose out of nothingness in a big bang. On the second day, he advances the teleological argument for the existence of God, also known as the argument from design. The thrust of this argument is that God is needed to explain life. Evolution alone will not suffice. On the third day, he addresses the problem of evil, in which the all the sin and suffering of this world seems to be inconsistent with the existence of an all-powerful, loving God. His answer is that evil is the price we pay for having free will, which includes the freedom to accept Jesus as our savior, which will allow us to dwell in Heaven for eternity. He also presents the moral argument for the existence of God, which is that God is needed as a foundation for morality.Naïve me. I thought that Radisson's presentation on the first day was just a pose. I thought what would happen was that in the end, Radisson would give Josh an A for having the courage of his convictions, for being able to defend his views in front of the classroom, knowing that he was being judged by a militant atheist. Boy, was I wrong! That became clear after the first presentation, when Radisson becomes physical and threatening, presumably because he feels threatened by Josh. (Maybe I should have suspected something when I saw Radisson's goatee, which is often seen in popular images of the Devil.) After the third day, Josh gets the better of Radisson when he asks him why he hates God, and we find out that he hates God because God let his mother die when he was young. Then Josh asks him how he can hate someone who doesn't exist. Golly! Radisson never thought of that.The rest of the movie shows how sweet and wonderful Christians are, and how mean and selfish atheists are, including Chinese communists. Of course, not everyone who believes in God is sweet and wonderful. You have to believe in the real God, because a Muslim kicks his daughter out of the house when he discovers she is an apostate who secretly listens to sermons on Christianity.Radisson is hit by a car, receiving fatal injuries. But that's all right, because God kept Reverend Dave in town by not allowing any car he got into to start until he was needed at that intersection where Radisson was hit. And so it is that in the long tradition of atheists in movies, Radisson repents and lets Jesus into his life just before he dies.I learned something from watching this movie. I learned that it was made by Pure Flix Productions, a company that specializes in the genre of Christian paranoia, and it does so with a simple-mindedness that makes Sunday school look like a Jesuit seminar. At the beginning of this essay, I said that I try to keep my knowledge about a movie to a minimum before I watch it, except for such things as the title and the date in which the movie was made. I now add one more item to that list. From now on, before I watch a movie, I want to know if it was produced by Pure Flix, because if it was, there is no way I will subject myself to another movie like this one."
" God's Not Dead opinion
",2017-11-06 00:00:00,4,"As expected, a movie about Christianity or religion, made by Christians, may tend to be overzealous, which this movie is. The premise of the movie is that students enter a philosophy class, and their first assignment is to write on a piece of paper ""God is Dead"", then sign their name to it. It is down to one student, that refuses to write and sign the paper. The professor ostracizes the student, but gives him a chance, via 3 lectures to prove God exists. The movie could have been over in 60 seconds, by the reasoning, If you want me to write God is Dead, then you would have to assume He has to be alive at one time or another, for Him to be dead. If he was alive, then He exists. I blame this flaw on, the Christians that wrote the movie, probably never consulted an atheist, or studied their point of view. As a Christian, I applaud any movies that show God, or Christianity in a positive light. But in the same sense, if you are not going to be objective, and view all non Christians, as stereotypical characters, that are always attacking Christianity, then I think you will drive more away from your beliefs, than you attract. One question to the writers, why was there only one student, who refused to complete the assignment? Even if you were quasi Christian, wouldn't you feel squeamish, by denying GOD before your fellow man?"
" God Is Alive
",2017-10-20 00:00:00,10,"We finally have our chance to get back to our tradition, to our true selves, to our values, thanks to this movie. The plot may be quite simple, but we see true emotions of those who stand for their faith. This film is something that can make us better. Remember: God is good, all the time. All the time, God is good!"
" Reality of Education Exposed
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,7,"Professor Raddison (Kevin Sorbo) gives an almost parallel performance to the sad reality of how the educational systems in America, with exception to private Christian colleges and schools. Overall teachers, willingly (or unwillingly), are attempting to manipulate our youth into questioning the existence of God, inhibit individuals from expressing their faith, and facilitating doubt in the minds of those trustingly eager to learn. Through my experience as a college student, I was subjected to these efforts of inculcation by ""free thinking"" instructors trying to use their ""professional power"" to teach without allowing student's the liberty to speak freely about their faith in God. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs, including Christians, and those rights shouldn't be dominated by an atheistic educational system that tries to control our constitutional rights to freedom of religion and speech as Raddison demonstrates in his attempt to dominate (bully) student Josh Wheaton (Shane Harper) in this film. There are professors like Raddison's character that exist (you must watch to understand). Likewise, the reality is that teacher's aren't allowed to speak freely about their Christian beliefs without reprimands from their school officials and administrators. This message needs to be voiced to all in hopes to aid in the awareness that GOD IS NOT DEAD and that there is so much good in the world because of that faith. However, as a Christian, I rated this film lower according to it's extremity of stereotypes and that not all of the characters portrayed are exact- but they exist. There are extremes (good and bad) in all categories in life. The movie does make generalizations of the worst scenarios of characters and they could have illustrated roles more clearly so that the message could make a stronger impact on everyone. Acceptance and non-judgment would have been a stronger message portrayed in this film and that is why I wrote a review to help you stay open minded that nobody is perfect, but unconditional love and acceptance is what the majority wants. As a college professor today, and being in the education industry for over 15 years, I have witnessed freedoms of faith being restricted for everyone and this is happening in the public school systems consistently, not to mention other industries. We all have free will and this is just the kind of movie that should be watched by believers, non-believers, atheists, theists, and anyone who is interested. Another option for a tagline could be 'Live and let live', after all it seems like we all just need to be open-minded to ""co-exist"", not judge others that are trying to find their own spiritual path and have overall happiness."
" Unintentionally absurd
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,4,"There is much to raise both an eyebrow and a chuckle in this movie, which wastes a frankly potentially interesting premise on casual religious bigotry. The film seems set in a world where the ""religious"" enquiry is boiled down to two possibilities. On the one hand, the most arrogantly certain stripe of Atheism. On the other hand Theism (to the exclusion of Deism, Pantheism, Pandeism, Panentheism, Polytheism, and a range of other options). And not just Theism, but one of the relatively small set of faiths within the grouping of *Abrahamic* Theism. And not just Abrahamic Theism, but American-style Christianity.In the world of this film, Islam is a dark stereotype on the edges of reality, Judaism and Mormonism and Hinduism are nonexistent, and really neither is Agnosticism to be seen, even. Christians and Atheists are equally just so beguilingly *certain* in their knowledge of the unknowable. And yet the God debated isn't really the Christian God, since the arguments used in favor of their being a God at all are more suitable to supporting a God of Deism (if not Pandeism).There is room in higher levels of discourse for films examining the fertile grounds of Agnosticism, Pandeism, even avenues of Polytheism. There is just no room for that level of discourse in this film."
" Such an awesome movie
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,9,"Such a true depiction of our world today. Liberal colleges with Anti-God teachers. If you feel the movie is a bit slow at the beginning, stick with it, the end is worth the wait. So inspirational. I watched it on TV but then bought the DVD so I could pass it around for others to watch. Loved seeing Willie and Korie Robertson in it."
" Strawmanning Level Expert.
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,1,"I wouldn't mind this movie if it weren't so popular. I'd file it away as another piece of propaganda that Christians watch just cause there's God in it, and walk away.However, for one, it is popular. And apart from that, it tackles the topic of Christianity vs atheism in such an absurd manner that it baffles me some people actually concluded: ""Damn, that was insightful"" after seeing it.I know of such people first-hand. My family did just that.THE PLOT: Josh believes in God. He enters college. His philosophy professor is an atheist and he demands that all his students renounce religion (What The Hell?). Josh refuses; the professor challenges him for a series of debates on the topic.Sounds interesting, eh? This could have been a good premise. But this is propaganda, so you know how it goes. Every atheist character either ends badly, or converts, or turns out not to have been an atheist at all! Yeah, you read it well. Apparently for the film creators the only conceivable reason for calling yourself an atheist is that a) this terrible demoralized Western world has pushed you off track, b) you're just angry with God and giving him the cold shoulder.The debates Josh has with the professor are ridiculous. Josh's arguments basically rely on some romantic notions like, and I quote, ""The unimaginably intense flash of light during the Big Bang was how you could expect the universe to react to God's command of 'Let there be light.'"". Is this serious? And the man who is supposed to be a philosophy professor actually takes it as such and eventually embraces faith.It's maddening to me since I've watched hundreds of Christian vs atheist debates and I know how most atheist intellectuals would *really* react to such arguments. These people are relentlessly rational, whether you like that approach or not. You can hardly sway them with half-assed metaphysical rambling. They'd laugh in your face and recite a list of logical fallacies you've just committed.Anyway, of course it's just a movie, it can make whatever claims it wants. But if you want more nuanced perspective on atheism vs Christianity, go watch some Dawkins, both the Hitchens brothers, and throw in some Jordan Peterson for good measure. This film will do you no favors."
" ""God's Not Dead"" should NOT be missed!
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,10,"""God's Not Dead"" is an amazing faith-based film and should NOT be missed! This awesome production really resonated with me and I enjoyed it immensely. As the title suggests, this film delivers an inspirational, uplifting message: God is NOT dead---He's surely alive! We know exactly what we're getting when we watch this movie and I welcome it. This project is supported by some incredible music, a great script and superb acting. Thank you Pure Flix Entertainment for this terrific production. If films like these are considered ""propaganda,"" then please keep 'em coming!"
" A Movie of Hope for Christians, but Condemnation for Non-Christians
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,5,"The movie, God's Not Dead, attempts to demonstrate that even in the ever-pressing notion that there is no God, there are still a few who will stand up to their belief in God. Within this attempt to demonstrate a message of hope to those who believe that the society has fallen into a complete lack of faith, I believe that the movie fails to show a Christian charity to those who do not believe in God. Instead of portraying atheists or anybody who shows a different belief with love and equality, this movie condemns those who do not believe in God.Professor Radisson, who plays the role as the atheist, is portrayed as a cruel man thus generalizing all atheists as cruel people. Then again, the movie portrays Muslims and Chinese as heartless people who are disgusted with those who differ in belief. Although the movie fails at demonstrating Christian charity to those who do not believe in God, they demonstrated beautifully the power of witnessing faith in God and how one strong voice can lead to others to hope. How could this movie successfully demonstrate that God is real when they do not show His love to those who they are trying to reach out to? It's evident how once those in Josh's class come to hear about God's existence, there was the presence of a deeper joy among the classmates. Although the movie successfully demonstrated the joy of standing up to belief in God and the effusive power of spreading faith, it failed at demonstrating the differences among beliefs charitably. There is a degree where it is necessary to demonstrate the beauty of God and His reality, but there also needs to be great caution not to accuse or belittle those who do not believe in God. Who could be able to begin to come in a belief in God if their viewpoint is shown to be completely evil and that they themselves are horrible cruel people?"
" A Lifelong Cinema Fanatic & Born Again Agnostic's Take on ""God's NOT Dead"" 7/10
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,7,"........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, Colombia & ORLANDO, FLHere is a snapshot stat that speaks VOLUMES about people's evaluation, reaction and perception of this film and, perhaps, to the ""Faith based"" sub- genre in general: Go to the God's NOT Dead Main PageClick on Ratings: 23,267 Users...Look at that Breakdown of People's RATINGS!!! 35% Rate it a Maximum 10 Stars 27½% Rated it a Minimum 1! This means that nearly 2 out of every 3 persons who voted on the movie opted for the extremes. I have checked out the ratings on perhaps 15,000 films and I can guarantee that you almost NEVER see polarization as extreme as what is exhibited here! But THIS is MY Review of God's NOT Dead. My RATING: I awarded it 7 Stars, after my second viewing...After My first, I rated it 6 because of something on screen just before the end credits. First off: O.K, I must admit I usually make it a point to avoid the ""Faith based"" sub-genre. Were I to explain, it would involve a couple paragraphs. So just refer to the Title of this review and use your imagination, O.K.? Why? You must be asking yourself, Why did you decide to watch this? Fair enough question! Well, in conjunction with our English Classes, one frequent activity we utilize is watching a film together and then discussing it. The students usually select which films we watch. ""GOD"" was the result of this process.Truth be told, my expectation was extremely low. Make that ""abysmal"". Had I seen it 40 years ago, it just might have been given 1 Star. That was when I was still going through my virulent Anti-Catholic phase. You probably know the drillBrought up as a Catholic, quit Catholic school at age 14.etc. Now, although certainly not a religious person, I would qualify myself as at least a relatively spiritual one. Respect for other people, their beliefs and their belief systems should be a major consideration in ALL our interactions. Needless to say, you might have noticed that this, all too frequently, is not the case! At its core, ""GOD"" is a David vs. Goliath cautionary tale. A newbie devoutly Christian College Freshman (Shane Harper) is forced to take on his seasoned, hostile Philosophy professor (Kevin Sorbo) to defend the existence of God.At the onset, it seems our Freshman's task is predestined to dismal failure. But the movie is a case study in perseverance and standing up for what you believe in. Who could possibly not like that?...Apparently, a lot of people! Accompanying that 28% 1 Star Rating demographic, there must be a lot of snickering and eye- rolling going on in response to its ""Faith-based"" label. Maybe we could use a little bit less of that dismissive attitude in our society in general! 7*....ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA! Any comments or questions, in English o en Español, are most welcome!"
" I'm a creationist Christian who doesn't like this movie
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,4,"Pros:1. Really good acting on the part of the antagonist, and fairly good acting for everyone else.2. Raises one or two good points in defense of Christianity.3. Pretty good storytelling and script.Cons:1. Bad apologetics.2. Flawed execution of premise.3. Lazily written protagonist.4. Sends a variety of wrong messages.5. Stupid subplots.6. The script really falls apart in the third act.7. Oh, and the soundtrack ins't great either. The terrible Christian rock music at the end is especially grating.Many detractors say the premise is ridiculous. I actually think the basic premise is quite clever and even fairly realistic. The way it's executed however is ridiculous and unrealistic.Many of these people who insist that it is unrealistic for an atheist professor to try to force a Christian student to defend his faith in class would be the same people defending the professor if such a thing actually happened, saying Christians shouldn't be exempt from having to defend their beliefs with evidence and that they have it coming if they want to challenge the entirely of peer reviewed science or some other lazy excuse.That said, the idea of the professor only giving the student three days to argue his case, and of the student accepting the challenge so readily, and of none of the other students including the atheist ones finding the whole thing the least bit objectionable is stretching to say the least.It would be more realistic for the professor to say ""I'll give you a month to prepare and then 20 minutes at the end of the last day of class of each week until April to present, plus you have to write a 12 page essay on which I will grade you for how well you convince me of the validity of your religion. I anticipate that about halfway through you will realize that you are just embarrassing yourself, sign the damn paper, and then we can move on from your youthful stupidity and delusions of grandeur."" Granted, that might be harder to fit into a feature length script, but it would be a lot more realistic and make it a lot more difficult for atheists to just dismiss the whole movie as being based on a fundamentally ridiculous plot.But, since they didn't chose that route, they left themselves with no choice but to use the most shallow and unconvincing arguments. Sure, within the context of a broader theological and philosophical debate the points they raise might have merit, but the confines of the script don't allow for broad theological and philosophical debate.The movie at least doesn't also pander by having all the atheist students gang up and bully the protagonist as well, and in fact it treats the other atheists besides the professor quite charitably. But it's somewhat disengenuous that in the beginning not one of them will admit to having a problem with a professor blatantly abusing a Christian student and by the end they are all confessing that God Is Not Dead.I also think this movie sends the wrong message to young Christians in positions of vulnerability and tries to inspire them with a false and dangerous sense of worldly invincibility in the face of persecution, which is typical of evangelicals. The whole ""put on the full armor of Christ and you can do it"" theme is simplistic at best and dangerous at worst. Contrary to what evangelicals will try to tell you, Christians are not called to automatically accept challenges to defend their faith wherever and whenever they are issued. Challenges by people in positions of power over you where their clear and only intent is to use your as a weapon against your faith and to ""make an example"" of you are especially not something that you should rise to lightly. In the case of campus persecution, there are lawyers and administrative appeals for a reason, and in most cases it may be best to just use them.It also doesn't help that the protagonist is a Marty-Stu pretty boy with everything going for him in life who's able to meet the challenge because he's just such a smart young man. If there's one thing the movie does right, it's that they at least made it clear that the antagonist has known real suffering in life. But that ends up making the professor more real and relatable than the protagonist whose biggest concern is that he might not make it into law school if he accepts the professor's challenge.But perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is the same problem that can be found in almost every facet of the US evangelical movement: it makes worship about you, rather than Christ. The theology of this movie is not Christ-centered. I don't see this movie as being about a brave kid who defends his faith in the face of persecution, I see this movie as being about a kid who discards all judgment and discernment to prove a point, because like the evangelical movement as a whole this is really about his Personal Crusade for Christ rather than serving the will of the Lord. In that way him and the professor at least have a little in common. If you're an evangelical you may not be able to see that, but your atheist friends can, and if you plan to use this movie as a tool of evangelism then be prepared to be disappointed. If you just watch it as personal inspiration then it's somewhat more suited to that purpose, but even then you need to be wary of the messages the movie sends."
" Very Encouraging
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,10,"I am a Christian and I liked this film. It represented most of my core beliefs perfectly. It may have been aimed at the choir but that's okay. Sometimes even the choir needs to be encouraged. Having spent 12 years in college, I can certainly attest to the fact that professors like the one portrayed in this movie do exist. I can also confirm there are few brave souls out there that are not afraid to stand up and share their beliefs in Christ. If you are a Christian in college, I highly recommend this movie to you."
" I could say so much, but this movie does not deserve in-depth analysis..
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,1,"So I am not going to say much.To summarize, it's just religious propaganda. Poorly executed. It's almost pornography for the cognitively dissonant modern American evangelical Christian masses. The ignorance is astounding. I feel bad for Christian intellectuals. They will have to undo the damage because this movie is damaging to the moderate modern Christian cause in America.I am not religious. I'm barely a moderate atheist. I am not anti- religion either. I'm indifferent 99% of the time these days. But this movie was bad. Pure propaganda. It's box office success can only be attributed to the fact that people only went to see it to see how bad it was."
" Love it
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,9,One of my favorite movies. I saw this one and the second one in theaters twice. It will deepen your faith if you're a Christian but will probably offend a lot of people who aren't (hence the 1 star reviews from them). Definitely recommend this movie! The only reason I gave it 9 stars instead 10 is because I thought the second movie was better than the first.
" An insult to anyone - Christian or not
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,1,"I won't repeat all the true things other reviewers have already said. I want to focus on the sub-story of the Muslim girl finding Jesus. The way her father is portrayed is obviously racist, but this sub-plot has a revealing element that accentuates how bad this movie really is. The movie is trying to tell people believing in God is better than not believing in him. The man with the strongest faith in this movie is arguably the Muslim father. He is portrayed as a bad person for kicking out his daughter. He does it based on his faith - OK people taking this propaganda serious will say it's the wrong kind of faith- but don't tell me these same people wouldn't kick out their own children as well if they learned that they were gay. Probably the worst movie I have ever seen!"
" This Movie is Not Good, but Not Bad
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,6,"One of the reviews on this by rwallace71 didn't do the movie justice by taking an atheistic opinion on the whole movie, and not on some of the good points. For example, they did say that the movie had too many random sub-plots that just barely came together. I have seen this before in another Christian movie, and they came together very well, making a good movie. These didn't quite do that. The acting was okay, although the plot where the girl gets cancer then becomes saved was cheesy, or the professor going flying up one story high after being hit by a breaking car is very unlikely and quite ridiculous when you see it in the movie. The story overall was good, but too many sub-plots and some cheesy moments. Yes, they did also use it to give a popular Christian band (which is actually pretty good) some free publicity, which I didn't find very good. Just about a three and a half star rating from me. But seriously. If you're only going to give the movie hate for being Christian, don't write a review at all.Thanks, TheChristianMovieGuy"

" This ""Film"" is god awful. (Get it?)
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,2,"Gods Not Dead is awful. I originally watched it back in April or May of 2014, when I was only 10. I was still religious back then, so I decided to watch this movie. What I remember from that day was pretty blurred, so I re-watched it earlier today, and oh my god (So to speak) this ""Film"" was terrible. I have a few reasons for why this ""Film"" is terrible, so here they are:1) Demonizing Atheists - If you want to watch something that makes atheists look like awful people, then look no further and rent this garbage movie on Amazon! I will bring up how people who aren't Christians are demonized later, but I think this point really stands out from that. For one, the main antagonist of the story, Professor Raddison, makes all of his students write,""God is dead,"" on a piece of paper, which already makes no sense. What professor would ever do that in a real life situation? Anyway, aside from that, this film makes it look like all atheists just hate God and hate Christianity, when most atheists don't hate God or Christianity, they just don't see much proof for God and they don't believe in Christianity. This film also makes it seem like all atheists become atheists because something tragic happens to them, which is so nonsensical and just dumb it hurts.2) There are like 5 stories going on at once - This film is a mess. Instead of focusing on the main character Josh's ""Struggle"" to protect his faith against Professor Raddison, the people who made this movie had to make like 4 other stories and force them all into the same movie so they could mesh together at the end. First there's the story line of Professor Raddison, then there's a storyline of a relationship between Josh and some girl (I forgot what her name was), then there's ANOTHER storyline where a reporter gets cancer, then there's ANOTHER storyline where there's a girl who pretends to be Muslim but in all reality she's a Christian and- Good lord, what is with all the story lines? I have 2 guesses for why the makers of this ""Film"" added so many stories together in 1 ""Film"":1) They knew they would run out of arguments for Josh and Raddison to have, so they put in the extra stories.2) They wanted the movie to piece together at the end. I'm looking more towards the first option.3) Anyone who isn't a Christian is a bad person or something terrible happens to them - Here's the one that is the most infuriating to me. The father of the girl who pretends to be Muslim beats her and kicks her out when he finds out she's been listening to Bible lessons, Professor Raddison is portrayed as a bad person just simply because he's an atheist, the reporter lady, who's an atheist in the context of the ""Movie"", gets cancer, like what? The ending is what infuriates me the most. Raddison gets hit by a CAR and dies. Like, oh my god, who wrote this?!The only ""Good"" things in this ""Film"" (If we're stretching the meaning of good) are the cinematography and acting, which is why I gave this film a 2 star instead of a 1 star rating. Overall, the ""Film"" is terrible."
" Better Than I Thought It Would Be
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,"Despite the fact that I identify myself as a Christian, I am often quite wary of religious-based efforts like this. See, I'm also a huge fan of just great movies in general. More often than not, religious films are not just kind of films. For the most part, however, ""God's Not Dead"" manages to steer clear to too much cheesy-ness and produce a pretty solid, thoughtful effort.For a basic plot summary, the concept of this movie revolves around Josh Wheaton (Shane Harper), a college student enrolled in a basic philosophy course. His extremely arrogant professor Radisson (Kevin Sorbo) wants the entire class to sign a waiver indicating that ""God is dead"", so they can move on to ""more important matters"". As a Christian, Josh will not sign his name, despite the fact that it will cause him so much trouble. He is tasked with proving God's existence to the whole class while steadily being harped on by the Prof.Besides that main plot line, there are a number of other ""spin-off"" mini-plots. If you've seen the movie ""Crazy Stupid Love"", it is that exact same kind of thing...exception played for religion instead of comedy. Everything kind of ""comes together"" in the end (all the stories converge on each other).The give-and-take between the student and professor is easily the highlight of the whole experience. It really gets to the heart of the religious-atheist differences that are constantly being debated to this very day. Of course, it does promote Christianity. That is something you have to understand going in. This isn't exactly a scientific treatise or anything. But for Christians who believe in the messages, it does a great job of conveying them.About the only reason I can't give it the full five star treatment? Besides the main two characters, some of the other acting in the film is less-than-stellar. I won't name names out of respect, but a few performances were so bad they actually took me out of the experience for awhile as it was all I could focus on.Overall, though, I very much enjoyed ""God's Not Dead"" as a Christian viewer. It is a movie that had a goal (to show audiences what many Christians believe when it comes to philosophical and world-creation topics) and accomplishes that goal very well. It manages to do that (and still get a major release and buzz) without dumbing down its message to pander to audiences. I respected that approach and enjoyed the experience."
" ""God's Not Dead""- Objectively passable on a technical filmmaking level. But the condescending propaganda and straw-man arguments the script relishes in make it unwatchable.
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,1,"""God's Not Dead"" was a surprise hit in 2014, and one of the few overt Christian-themed dramas to really find a rather large mainstream audience, bringing in more than $60 million at the box-office on an extremely meager $2 million budget. However, as with many films that deal with blatant and obvious religious themes, it drew quite a bit of controversy, and it's really hard to be objective on a fundamental level towards a work like this. Your own personal views are almost guaranteed to dictate your enjoyment towards a film of this nature. But as someone who is agnostic-bordering-on-atheist but very open to the idea of faith (just as I am open to the notion that God might very well not exist), I'm a pretty impartial audience member. I've enjoyed films with religious themes in the past, and even if I completely disagree with a viewpoint presented, I can can enjoy a good and well-written movie no matter what. Even if just for achievements in the technicalities of filmmaking or good writing.Unfortunately, director Harold Cronk's ""God's Not Dead"" is not a good or well-written film. In fact, I'd go so far as to regard it as near-unwatchable. And it really falls back on one massive, unforgivable issue- this isn't really a movie. It's a blatant piece of self-aggrandizing propaganda that was manufactured exclusively to profit from the religious by force-feeding them only what they want to hear without challenging them in any way or doing anything to strengthen their faith. It doesn't reward its Christian viewers- it babies them in a genuinely troubling and patronizing way. It's like dangling keys in front of an infants face. It treats the Christian characters like saints. It demonizes atheist characters by turning them into nothing but either blood-thirsty, mustache- twirling villains or weak-willed lost-souls who need to ""see the light."" It inserts blatant pieces of product- placement and tactless bits of advertising to appeal to the youth. It's just generally a disgusting experience.It's honestly about as condescending as you can get. I honestly can't help but feel sorry for the people who were suckered into seeing it thinking it would be a positive experience in faith. When in actuality all it is, is lowest-common-denominator trash that pushed just the right buttons to come out, take their money and leave them with nothing gained from having seen it. Thankfully, I think enough people have learned this, especially as the 2016 follow-up earned significantly less at the box office.We follow college student Josh Wheaton (Shane Harper)... yes, his name really is ""Josh Wheaton""... who enrolls in a philosophy course headed by Professor Jeffrey Radisson (Kevin Sorbo), who insists that each and every student sign a piece of paper stating ""God is dead"" in order to pass his class. Of course, Josh refuses, and thus begins a sort-of rivalry between the two, eventually leading to a series of very arrogant debates about whether or not ""God is dead."" Along the way, a series of loosely connected subplots involving broad stereotypes plays out, most of which paint anyone atheist or liberal as evil or petty. And they even throw in references and cameos from the show ""Duck Dynasty"" for ""good"" measure! ...Yawn.Honestly, the film's not a complete and total failure. I actually found Sorbo fairly compelling even if his character is flat and follows an easily predictable story-arc. He does good with the material provided. Some scenes are reasonably well-shot and there's a few cute moments here and there. But honestly, the complete ignorance and constant straw-man nature of the script by Chuck Konzelman and Cary Solomon is just cringe-worthy and incredibly snobbish. This film really was an opportunity to say some fascinating things and to both challenge and reward the faithful viewers it was certain to have. It could have found a way to deliver a compelling tale about reconciliation and finding peace between people with different viewpoints. In another universe, the film could have been an uplifting tale about the two leads coming to terms with their differences and perhaps even becoming friends despite having vastly different beliefs, and celebrated faith by giving the viewers hope... but nope! Without spoiling anything, from the opening scene, the film makes it clear that it has nothing but contempt and disdain for anyone who dares hold an opposing viewpoint, and goes out of its way to manufacture conflict. It's actually really disheartening and even dangerous.There's really no other way to say it... this is a 1 out of 10. It's condescending. It's snobby. It thumbs its nose at those who disagree with Christianity. And it's nothing but a clear attempt to profit off of the faith of the viewers. It's just a disgusting film all around. There are other, far better Christian films out there that can be enjoyed by the faithful and sometimes even the not-so-faithful (like me, I suppose) alike. See one of those instead."
" The ultimate insult.
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,1,"I was curious to watch this movie. I have always been interested in these debates because, here in Europe, the absence of faith and the growing number of atheists is very visible. However, I was absolutely disgusted because of the huge bias with which everything is addressed. The film was made and sponsored by evangelical Christians, but note that they call themselves just Christians. It turns out that Christianity is much more vast and has long been divided into hundreds of independent churches, all of them Christian, though discordant to each other. So do not be surprised that many Christians do not share the point of view of that Christians. I am a Roman Catholic Christian and I do not agree with this movie.We cannot discuss faith because its something absolutely personal, but this movie brings us a debate in which God is exclusive property of a group of people: the evangelicals. However, if God is as our parents teach us, then He loves everyone and is the Lord of us all, even of those who do not believe in Him. The Muslims worship the same god as Christians but they were very mistreated in this film, along with atheists, who are truly diabolized. I know many atheists, but none of them are at war with God, as the teacher of this movie seems to be! Usually, they are very tolerant people, but they demand the right not to be converted by anyone to any faith and, we have to recognize, they have that right, and we, theists, have no right to judge them for it. The film, however, condemns and labels, which is ironic if we consider that the Bible is the first to warn against such judgments.To summarize, the film is a huge insult to all who do not identify themselves as evangelical Christians, but insults particularly the atheists, agnostics and Muslims. The script is a colossal piece of propaganda that backfired. The cast is a disgrace, everything is a disgrace. Ultimately, the awful quality of the final product can end up being a valid argument for us to praying to God for a miracle: the total disappearance of the film from the shelves and from our memories. If such a miracle happened, I would only regret not being able to call the Vatican to warn about it, but I would be happy to believe that this film never existed."
" We think we know whats going on, but we want our own reality
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"Here is a terrible film. That's the best word I have to describe it. Its about a college student who must defend his faith. However nobody in the entire campus thinks its illegal. The main plot is terribly written. But the side plots are even worse such as the cast of Duck Dynasty and a liberal ( the liberals are evil in this movie of course) a stereotyped Muslim who beats his daughter up, and some other plots which are forgettable. This movie is akin more to torture than family entertainment. Do not ever buy this movie unless you want a terrible movie. I'd give this film a rating of negative pi, but 1 the worst they have."
" Powerful, Wonderful, Thought Provoking
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"I am a Christian and I thought the movie was excellent. I read a few of the other reviews and my prayer for all those that left a review is that each and every person receive a deeper revelation of the meaning of the movie and place their faith in the only true living God that loves the world even though the world does not love God back. This movie is simple to understand and the actors brought a realistic feel to the movie. The professor realized that at the end of his life, he did believe in God but he was mad at God and realized that God was not the source of his problems. Fear was. Fear holds us back from lots of things, even the truth. Can't wait to see the sequel."
