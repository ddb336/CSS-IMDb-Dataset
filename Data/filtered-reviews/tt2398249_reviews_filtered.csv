" Outstanding parody
",2021-04-10 00:00:00,8,"If you can get past the ""you can say that again"" scene with the bartender, and STILL don't get it, you need to turn it off and go watch how to lose a guy in ten days... the entire point in this movie IS to make you feel uncomfortable and to make you laugh at the idiocy of movies like ten days...
They did a great job and it was funny and sarcastic and makes you squirm.. all things a good parody SHOULD accomplish."
" You'd think with all the amazing actors...
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,4,That it would be much better than it was. Perhaps a failed Naked Gun? Got a few laughs but mostly it was just silly stupid.
" Worst movie ever
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,2,"God that was brutal, I thought it was gonna be a good movie because I absolutely love both Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, but David Wain actually managed to make a bad rom-com starring both of them. This movie is basically a parody on cheesy corny rom-coms, but it absolutely sucks. It's neither funny nor romantic, and at only 80 minutes, it's too long. I kept watching it, hoping it would get better but it just didn't. I strongly advise you not to watch that movie, and don't just ignore the reviews because the cast is good, please don't waste 80 minutes of your life on honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
" Delightful !
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,9,I never heard of this movie before now and it's 2021 and I could kick myself because I've watched some real crap lately. When I was little Airplane was one of my favorite movies and someone compared it to They Came Together so I immediately set about watching it. Some jokes were subtle but really really funny and others were in your face but I enjoyed all of them.
" You're not watching it properly
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,8,"I didn't get this movie first time around, but on second viewing i couldn't stop laughing. This hammers home every romantic comedy cliche, it is pure satire, one movie length SNL skit. Amy and Paul are perfect for these roles, the supporting cast is awesome, and let's face it, anything with Mantzoukas in it is going 2 make u laugh..Watch it as a movie making fun of itself and that's where you'll find the humour."
" Hilarious satire. All star comedy cast and great writing!
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,9,"Looking at the metascore of approximately 5.5, apparently this is one of those movies, like napoleon dynamite that you either love or hate. And if you hate it, sadly it's because you're an idiot and don't get it. You probably voted for trimp. Sorry for your low brain capacity. If you do, however, have some gears turning in your head and love a good satirical comedy then you will love this movie!"
" Literally, Laugh Out Loud!
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,8,"It's always a nice feeling when you see a familiar, enjoyable Director. I saw the EPs/ director and knew I would enjoy this title. ""They Came Together"" is by the guys who did the hilarious, over the top, slapstick, big A-List Cast know as the 'Wet Hot American Summer' series..
Honestly, if you didn't get the original movie (then, the subsequent Netflix prequel series) ***try some more, uhm, green-feel good) )) you might not get this movie; if you did enjoy them, then you'll thoroughly understand what makes this cute, irreverent Rom-Com enjoyable."
" Dopey Tropey Trophy
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,2,"Simply put, this is an incessant rom-com trope barrage. One that pummels the genre so mercilessly, you end up disliking the satire Itself as much as it's target.
This kind of over the top, unabashedly self aware, in-your-face comedic acting works fine for the length of an average Saturday Night Live skit. But after a few minutes, you're hoping for a commercial break, or a number from tonight's musical guest.
Tbh, I'm not sure if I've ever watched a film that refuses to try at all, while at the same time trying way to hard.
The constant wink-wink goes from feeling clever, to feeling like a disconcerting twitch you wish would end up stopping already.
But if you're a fan of purposely vapid satires that make fun of films for being unoriginal by being unoriginal themselves, then you'll appreciate this film and the performances in it."
" Airplane for romcoms
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,9,If you get this type of comedy then it's hilarious and I did get it. Every scene made me laugh and I'm just disappointed I didn't see or hear about this film sooner. I loved it!
" Shame!
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,2,"Such a great cast but they neither pulled off the actual thing nor spoofing it.
It was so lame that at time it was funny, 2 stars for that and that is it."
" Hilarious
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,8,"If you ever watched a, boy meets girl , boy works for evil conglomerate and take girls business, hot ex girlfriend lures boy back, he realized she's truly a false supermodel, (Cobie) takes off her mask to reveal judge Judy,..so many on the nose and hilarious satires. Plus many great characters. Fun and silly gags.
Great if you actually get it"
" People not understanding what spoof is
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,8,"This film was a spoof,4th wall breaking, cliche hating film taking the mick of every tired overdone trope in romcoms. Marking it down for explaining jokes or dumbing it down shows you missed the point of spoof, it's airplane scary movie humour toned down into a rom com setting.Loved the nod to parks and rec and bill hader isn't far off Dwight schrute looking so that was funny, although I detest Ellie kemper. Just too phoney for my taste. Was a great movie, average plot but just a fun 90 mins.It's a SPOOF so humour in juvenile, not toilet level just really daft and then explained.i loved it. Calls out the stale formula of romcoms for last two decadesOne major flaw is similar to HIMYM in the days of beautiful women in movies and tv how colbie smulders gets pushed as a hot woman is beyond me, obviously not ugly but just nothing special plus a damn awful actress. Find her features really masculine not sure why just don't get her."
" I can't believe I spent $4 on this
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,1,"They came together is by far the worst movie I've watched in years. My wife and I paused it when one of us had to get up so we both had to suffer equally. I can't believe Amy Pohler and Paul Rudd actually did this. They must have had financial problems at the time, like huge gambling debts or drug habits.
Seriously, F@#$ this movie."
" Love it or hate it
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,10,"Every time I watch this film I laugh in hysterics, but I totally get why people would give it a low rating. I love it, its very silly and absurd but it also completely makes fun of the romcom genre."
" Amazing
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,10,I can rewatch this all day. This is the height of parody. There a barely a moment where there is no a clever different joke for them to put in.
" Horrible movie.
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,1,Don't waste your time. Bad acting. Not funny. Just kept worse and worse as it went along.
" Hilariously awesome
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,8,"If you like silly jokes and absurd gags, of the type of Leslie Nielsen movies, you will love this movie."
" I feel they started off serious movies, but after reviewing the footage; they decided to cover their asses by calling it a parody.
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,3,"1. If it's a parody of love story movies--see it after six beers, and 1/2 tube of glue. Oh yea, it would be better in you recently had a TBI.2. A member of the tribe managed to spend 3 million on this.3. Could be the worst movie ever.4. If your significant other likes this, be prepared for a miserable life.5. It's almost so bad, it might be worth watching, but after doing number 2.6. Rudd is not a leading man ever. Amy is a friend of a friend in any movie.7. I still think the director/writers/producers viewed this, and then decided to throw around it's a parody?8. Then again what do I know? Americans will probably love this hack?"
" Great parody of rom-coms
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,8,"I love Amy Poehler (Molly) and Paul Rudd (Joel), so I'm not sure how I missed this movie when it first came out. I almost didn't watch it when I saw it had really bad reviews on Amazon. Thankfully, IMDB members have better taste! This was so wonderfully stupid, with similar style and humor to Wet Hot American Summer (also written and directed by David Wain). There were a few bits that got old or were just over the top (Hello, Bubby) but it was mostly solid and I laughed the whole way through. I just wish that Ken Marino and Michael Ian Black had more screen time, as they were great as always in their bit roles. Bill Hader and Ellie Kemper were also very funny as the couple trying to follow Molly and Joel's story."
" Why is everyone hating on this???
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Listen, I am not a huge fan of abdurdist comedy, but I'm struggling to understand why this got so many hateful reviews... I rented this on Amazon expecting it to be unwatchable and enjoyed it all the way through, laughing a lot. Yes. There are some truly ridiculous moments and if they had dialed back the insanity - the suit of armor, poop jokes, ass pole, etc. - about 15-20% this would have been a great movie, but it had a lot of heart and I loved the performances. Definitely worth watching if you are up for stupid fun."
" Making fun of RomComs
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,7,"I get the jist of this movie... basically a droll send up of RomComs. I think the biggest problem with this movie is that it tries to plant its feet in both worlds... RomCom and parody of RomComs. The acting and writing is purposefully less than artful and the acting is purposefully wooden for effect. Sometimes the jokes land other times not so much. The story is told from one couple telling the other couple how they met and fell in love... it's an interesting premise for a movie, just not well executed. So, if you catch this movie on tv, just know it's definitely a hit or miss type of endeavor..."
" Rare comedy that shouldn't go unnoticed!
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie was so quirky and a great example of parody romance! A ""sex"" scene where they break everything on purpose, practicing an apology speech right in front of the main female role, montage of their growing relationship, the female role doing an outfit change but with crazy costumes. You just have to laugh and not go into this movie thinking it's that serious."
" I'm glad I watch this movie
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,10,This movie was jampacked with stars from all genres and please don't correct me about my grammar or sentence structure because I'm talking into my cell phone or punctuation either everybody was funny it's a laugh out loud movie there was so many stars it was like the avengers movie but it as a comedy but they're all superheroes anyway the story arc is wonderful everybody was very funny it was very very good
" They're great together!
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,7,"A rom com with a bit of fantasy.Their love didn't last long enough where most movies always end up a happily ever after. That's reality bites, don't expect ups without downs. Not just about love, also business. Thanks a lot movie writers, i was about to start a business but this movie made me think thrice.Be careful of a potential incest ideas, this neither a porn movie nor a japanese adult video. Just try watching it with an open mind, but this is the only part against my moral & I'd like to condemn Paul rudd's acting if he successfully plants the idea to anyone's subconscious mind.The downside of this movie, there's not much movie with this hilarious storytelling starring the woman from ""parks & rec"" & now the current ""ant man"" who seems not right for evangeline lilly.Overall, i watched it together with my wife & we laughed until the end."
" How can it be this bad?!
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,2,"There are so many actors in this that I love, so despite the sub 6.0 rating I thought, ""it can't be THAT bad."" I was proven wrong in less than 15 minutes. It is so, so, so, so bad. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because I did laugh a few times...while cringing"
" A crack at old school comedy - overlooked
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,10,"This is seriously one of the funniest movies I've seen in the last 10 years. We need more movies like ""Airplane"" which this movie is in the same style as. It really shouldnt be a dying thing. This movie has a fantastic cast and the jokes are unpredictable and I laugh every time.Seriously, these types of comedies need to be revived!"
" they came together to waste my time
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,4,"Boring movie actually It should not be classified as romantic, weird as awkward comedy and little bit drama, I didn't expect it like that."
" They came together I wish they didn't
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,6,"A typical lame film trying so hard to be different in my opinion it got partial success because it bacame weird comedy, intermittently funny but an overall cringy full of quikry humors, overtly wacky i find the stars of the film don't have chemistry together this might be the main factor why the film failed with the public viewers ."
" Just funny
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,9,I find myself mimicking this movie time and time again. I watched it a couple of years ago and it's just stuck with me. It was weird and funny and I just really realized recently how great it was. Only saw it once but was really glad I did. It's like naked gun for romcoms.
" its alright
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,3,"There isn't any subtly to the humour at all, every joke is incredibly on the nose and explained and you don't seem to get a brake from it. not 10 minutes in and I felt a little drained by it, not amused"
" Garbage
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,1,"Unspeakably bad. Script, acting, everything. Lame, pathetic, not even good enough to be adolescent humour. Shockingly, embarrassingly cringeworthy. Completely unwatchable. 20 minutes was enough for me."
" BAGELS ARE A METAPHOR FOR THE CIRCLE OF LIFE
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,7,"There is a plot synopsis on the back of the DVD cover, so it is hard to spoil the plot, which wasn't important. Raul Rudd plays Robert Hays in this spoof of Romantic comedies. There were lines which made me chuckle while there were boring predictable scenes like the one in the bar which was pointless and seemed endless. The scene with his grandmother could have been left out. Its crudeness lacked humor, especially since they did a similar scene just before that.The dialogue was bad by design, especially the end speech by Rudd, which in reality would have never worked. While the film has hit and miss humor, it is no ""Airplane"" which was an iconic film.I liked how they tried to work in metaphors which are overly used, especially in Indie films. I was amused by the film, had some chuckle out loud moments, and had some scenes making me look for the remote. No belly laughs. Worth renting for a laugh.Parental Guidance: F-bomb, comedy sex, no nudity."
" Weak movie - but with lovable main characters
",2017-11-17 00:00:00,3,"This is.... surprisingly weak. You have both Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler, and none of them are particularly funny in this movie. That said, Rudd is more like a funny straight man more than most comedians, but he can shine, ""slap-a-da-bass"" anyone? The jokes in here are pretty dim too, and when Americans try to create surreal humour, they seem to always fail miserably. And then we have a lot of predictable scenes, where you can see the joke coming many, many seconds away. If only they were funny, you could forgive (some) of it. But no. You're much better off watching Parks and Recreation again, where any five minutes of any episode, is much better than this entire movie."
" ... and I left baffled.
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,2,"Annoyingly smug and self-satisfied.Make fun of romantic comedies all you want - God knows that some of them deserve it... but when you explain everything over and over, to make sure we get the 'joke', that makes you just as bad. Irony doesn't save you.The vast majority of the humour drags insufferably... but then the one joke that does actually work on some weird level is edited so tightly as to deny us any reaction. It's a constant and perhaps even deliberate rejection of tone, and it had me off balance from the beginning, never to get back on side... Perhaps that was the intention, but if you want to destroy convention, then make it an inside job, and do it with engaging characters.It's not as if I have a fundamental objection to David Wain's style of comedy, either, because I loved ""Wanderlust""... Oh well."
" Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd star in this movie
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,6,"Boy, what a surprise! I was expecting something lighthearted from the guys behind ""Wet Hot American Summer."" Something funny and stupid. Heck, even a bunch of the same actors are in this. Instead I found this movie to be very serious, and to quite obviously take itself very seriously. This film even crosses over perhaps into ""mega-serious."" Sure, it was likely nominated for a couple of big Oscars, but it could really have benefited from a little levity, in this humble reviewer's opinion. I will say this though: the screenplay was very original. If I had to say it bore any similarity to any pieces of cinema I've seen I would call it maybe, in my mind, kind of like a mix of ""The English Patient,"" that one movie where the one guy likes to blow stuff up and the other guy has a job where he stops bombs from blowing up and he tries to stop the one guy from blowing stuff up, and that Richard Gere/Julia Roberts movie where Roberts is a bride who wears tennis shoes or something. And also sort of that Robin Williams movie in which he's a robot who becomes human (""Millennium Man"" I wanna say), because - if I remember correctly - Poehler's character dies at the end and is replaced by a six foot-seven titanium robot that the Rudd character falls even more madly in love with (and has a lot of (hot) sex with). In any event, if you are in the mood for a dry downer of a film that kind of drags on, is mainly only worth watching for the person-robot sex scenes in the final act, and stars two probable Canadians (Rudd and Poehler), then I would Highly recommend this title: an oddly super serious film by the makers of and performers in ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and its sequels/spinoff, ""Wetter, Hotter American Summer,"" ""Wet, Lukewarm Russian Summer,"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer: The TV Series."""
" Adored it
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,10,"I adored this movie. It got sooooo so many bad reviews so I wasn't super excited to watch it at first. But when I did, I loved it! It's definitely full of some rather stupid and obvious humor but I thought it was hella funny! Haha to me it seems very much like a SNL skit that was stretched out to movie length so I can see how some people may grow tired of it. But I thought it was very fun to watch. I think if you like to joke around while watching movies, this is a good one. If you like to sit back and just watch, maybe you'd be better off with something else. But honestly, I think all the negative reviews are too harsh and uptight. It's super silly, very quotable, and it makes you giggle. My sister and I still die laughing every time we watch it or even just talk about it. Bottom line: amazingly hilarious, probably a little dumb."
