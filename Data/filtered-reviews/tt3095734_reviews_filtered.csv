" Monster Trucks
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,5,"I saw the trailer for this fun looking film in the cinema, then I missed it a few times when it started showing on television, but finally I got the opportunity to watch it, and I hoped it would be worth waiting for, directed by Chris Wedge (Ice Age, Robots). Basically, in a small town near a lake in North Dakota, Terravex Oil is in the midst of a fracking operation, overseen by CEO Reece Tenneson (Rob Lowe) and geologist Jim Dowd (Thomas Lennon). During the operation, three subterranean creatures are released from an underground water system. Two of the creatures are captured by the oil company, but one of them escapes. Meanwhile, high school senior Tripp Coley (X-Men's Lucas Till) has taken up a part-time job at a local junkyard, to escape his home life; his parents are divorced, and his mother Cindy (Amy Ryan) is in a relationship with Sheriff Rick (Barry Pepper). He starts building a pickup truck which he plans to use to leave town, but it does not have a working drivetrain. One night, Tripp encounters the escaped creature in the junkyard, but it gets away before he can do anything. The next day, along with classmate Meredith (Evil Dead's Jane Levy), Tripp finds the creature has a diet of oil and it takes shelter within the hood of his truck. He befriends the creature, naming it Creech, and promises to help him get home. Tripp modifies the truck to give Creech more control over the truck as a makeshift engine, he and Meredith becomes impressed and surprised at Creech's speed of intelligence and talent. Meanwhile, Tenneson is concerned about protect the oil company's image. He sends hired mercenary Burke (Holt McCallany) to kill their captured creatures, and poison is put into a hole leading to the underwater tunnels. of Jim objects to these decisions, as he finds that the creatures can directly learn whatever skill is taught to them from the other one. Tripp and Meredith go see Tripp's father Wade (Frank Whaley) to seek help, but Wade sells Tripp out to Burke. Tripp and Meredith get away in the truck with Creech, pursued by Burke and his team along with Rick. Tripp, Meredith and Creech manage to escape by jumping over a train, and camp at a hunting cabin owned by Meredith's father near the lake. When Creech gets the sense something bad will happen to the other creatures, he heads to the Terravex headquarters where the other creatures are being held captive. Tripp and Meredith follow Creech using Meredith's cell phone vehicle tracker. When they arrive, they realise the other two creatures are Creech's parents. Creech arrives and is captured, while Tripp and Meredith are taken to Tenneson who tells them to forget about the creatures and has Burke escort them out. Sympathetic to the creatures' plight, Jim decides to help Tripp and Meredith rescue the creatures. With the help of Tripp's junkyard boss, Mr. Weathers (Danny Glover), they acquire and modify two more trucks for Creech's parents to control. Jim helps the group by stealing a Terravex truck and loads the creatures onto it. At the dealership, the creatures take control of the modified trucks based on Creech's own experience, and the group make their escape up the mountain leading to the tunnels. Terravex gives chase and the group escape by using the trucks to jump over the edge of the mountain. On the way, Rick helps Tripp and the group escape from Burke. Tripp gets into a head-on battle with Burke, who attempts to push him into the drilling hole, but Burke's truck is overturned, the poison machine is destroyed, and Burke is killed when his truck is thrown into the equipment. Creech saves Tripp from drowning before he and his parents depart back home and Terravex is exposed by the group for the experimentation that was harming the creatures' habitat. Tenneson is arrested for his crimes, Tripp and Rick are on good terms and work together to build a new engine for the truck, and Tripp and Meredith are in a relationship. Also starring Tucker Albrizzi as Sam Geldon, and Ready or Not's Samara Weaving as Brianne. Till is likeable as the leading young hero, Lowe is reasonable as the bad guy, and Glover is fine in his short time onscreen, and obviously Creech is an adorable character. It is a reasonably simplistic story, it makes you laugh enough at the right moments, it is sweet without being too mushy, the chase and action sequences are entertaining, and the special effects are of course terrific, it might have bombed at the box office, but it is a fun family friendly fantasy comedy adventure. Worth watching!"
" Meh.
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,5,"It's very cliched but not terrible. It does nothing at all new but I will say it did have a few funny scenes. Some intentionally, most of them unintentionally. They try to put in some emotional moments and it's actually funny how much they don't work. I will say that the creature at the centre of this movie is fun. The biggest problem is that the movie is forgettable and boring. The characters and story are completely uninteresting. However the 3rd act has quite a few ridiculous moments that actually make it kinda fun to watch, but most of the the first half of this film is boring. So in conclusion it's not good, nor is it memorably bad so it's ultimately very skip-able. (54%)"
" It is not terrible.
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,5,"On repeat viewings I realized its not that good. But not that bad. A mixed bag, but little kids will definitely love this one. I know I did when I was in 6th grade. But now it kinda sucks, but whatever."
" Surprisingly good movie
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,8,"I have to admit first off that I was dead set against this movie. I saw a previous movie almost based upon this but more on the horror side. So I couldn't bare another movie about a monster in a truck. I finally saw this movie and like so many starts out slow but builds to a climax that would keep your eyes glued to the TV. The characters are likable which adds a plus to this movie. Somehow I thought about ""Super 8"" where kids help a monster get home. The concept was ""ok"" out there. The plot holes are there, cars getting damaged yet no one is investigating the wrecks, cop's that are too easy going and the bullies aren't scary enough. The bad guys are quirky which just adds to the base. And the monster is nothing but lovable, E.T. in a sense.Now what I got was far from what I expected and that alone is a plus. The movie moves quickly which covers all the plot holes and the driving stunts are amazing. Rarely does a kid's movie grab my attention and keeps it to the end. It was like watching ""Herbie: The Love Bug"" where it's never explained how a car got a mind of its own. Creech (the creature) steals the hole movie in every scene it's in it grabs your heart Everytime. You end up rooting for Creech and hoping he finds it's way home.This movie will definitely be added to my library as will be watched several times. There is just too much to love about this movie and too much happening to notice all the flaw's this movie had. In all it's a great escape from the current issues we are living in (the virus pandemic, most places closed and money growing tight) that it's a great way to escape everything for a few hours."
" Senseless children's movie
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,3,It's Watchable and well funded but it's nowhere near 10 ðŸŒŸ
" So cute and family friendly
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,7,"This reminded me of movies from the 1980s. Evil oil and gas company threatens cute, previously unknown monsters when they drill deep underground into the monsters' habitat. Teenager befriends escaped monster and action ensues. Good guys save the day and the bad guys pay. It was all about the monsters for me...so very cute! The actors in it all were good...I especially loved seeing Danny Glover and Barry Pepper, and the teen couple was a good match. It made me smile a lot. I would definitely say it is for the whole family."
" Loved it!
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,8,"Such a fun movie. Very well done, great cast, great story. And they didnt ruin it with some lousy overdone high school love story (like A.X.L.)
And they had a fun twist on the ""monster truck"" that was only slightly ridiculous but mostly kinda cool.
My kid loved it as well"
" Great movie!!
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,10,Wonderful and fun movie to see! Definitely underrated. It'll leave you on the edge of your seat! My family and I enjoyed it very much. Beautiful scenery too. I recommend the movie highly.
" Petroleum guzzling squids
",2019-05-22 00:00:00,5,"Monster Trucks has Tetravex Petroleum hydrofracking in North Dakota and they
hit a big pool of water. Boss Rob Lowe says drill on through and they discover a
species of ancient amphibious life which has learned to survive on crude petroleum. They look fierce, but when treated nice like Lucas Till does and his
science tutor Jane Levy they can be friendly.And useful as he finds that the one that came across him is good for powering
his monster truck. It's now a monster truck in the literal sense of the word.And Till and Levy will need speed to overcome Lowe and his cronies, to both
capture the two creatures the oil company has and return to their homes in the
earth.Some of the elements of Mighty Joe Young are in this plot which has a kind of
goofy charm to it.And it's nice to see big oil lose one."
" Ignore the average score, this is great fun
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,8,"Nearly didn't bother as IMDB had this at 5.7 but it turned out to be yet another example of a great, fun, family movie that's been rated by waaay too many grumps that probably didn't realise it was a family/kids movie.The creatures were genuinely superb, from a CGI pov, truly likeable and the cast was good enough to keep it all totally watchable for adults.There were a few moments of, ""oh come on, how did he get there that quickly?"", but you can forgive the crew the odd bit of continuity screw-up because the reward is a perfectly good way to spend a 100 minutes of your afternoon!"
" Broken Down
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,3,"Monster Trucks shows flashes of inspiration throughout it's bloated, two hour runtime. However this film ultimately shows it takes more than monsters and trucks to create something compelling, or at the very least interesting."
" Despite all the silliness, I began to get used to the ride.
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,9,"As a throwback to 90's children's fare, as well as a generally fun and kind-spirited time at the movies, it succeeds admirably."
" Great movie for kids
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,6,"I have five kids ranging in age from 10 all the way to 3 years old. All of them enjoyed this movie. Clean language, fun storyline, not scary."
" Great movie for all ages.
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,9,"My husband and I watched this with our four children (ages 2-8) and we all loved it. Great acting, CGI, and plot. Original and well done. All of us watched the entire movie, even the 2 year old."
" Don't Worry If You Love Wholesome Movies.
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"It's a simple-plot-movie that beats up into your mind what was it like to watch a truly good kids movie when you were an innocent child surrounded by popular and bad kids movies. So what the hug are you waiting for?!
Hope on to a great ride full of love, friendship and caring!"
" A good film.
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,10,"Obviously made for children but I'm 69 and I thought it was great. Well made, well acted and well directed. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone regardless of age, but particularly my grandchildren."

" Real Monster Trucks
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,8,"A Family friendly movie that doesn't skimp pn the action,good fun for all ages."
" Dumb for the dumber in us....
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,6,"Ok, the bad first...It's a stupid movie...Now, the only thing that saves it is...welll...it's a stupid movie, heh heh...to tell the absolute truth, the movie kinda grew on me...and I found myself actually liking it some...I expect the kids will love it, because it is so irreverant in it's production values, but if you are a purist, mechanically inclined, it will make you cringe at times...okay, most of the time, heh heh...But truthfully, it can be considered a fun movie, just wanting to be outright silly..."
" Cute
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,6,"Family film with a pleasant cast, decent directing and an okay script. Lots of fun action, some cute creatures and okay effects make this suitable for all family members, although really young kids might find some of the scenes a bit intense. Overall, it's fun."
" infantile
",2018-05-30 00:00:00,2,This film is recommended only for under six years of age.
" Likeable and entertaining
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,8,"Loner teen Tripp wants to leave the small North Dakota town where he lives: he has issues with his mother's cop boyfriend, and has very few friends. Meanwhile, the local oil drilling company drills through to a subterranean lake, only to find that something is living down there. And that something comes to the surface, and suddenly a boy and his (engineless) truck have a motive power they never expected.This film is made up of bits and pieces taken from other, higher profile films, and nailed together. It is a high-school movie with the disaffected teen who doesn't fit in at school or at home. There is the budding teen romance between two characters who never expected it. We have heartless ecological vandalism on the part of big business. We have a security operative who is quite prepared to kill. James Cameron's The Abyss has been rifled for key moments. You will spot other movies which have ""donated"" assorted elements.Yet the bits fit together quite well, helped by three main things. One, the scenery (British Columbia standing in for North Dakota) is attractive and gives a sense of production value. Two, the monsters are very well realised, often funny, and hugely sympathetic. There is a strong sense of character and communication, which is commendable given that there is no spoken word from them: the CGI is excellent. And, three, the main characters are all likeable, If a film is average, the fact that you take pleasure in being in the company of the characters can make a big difference to how enjoyable the film is, and this movie is a case in point.Monster Trucks isn't going to hold many surprises for the average adult filmgoer, but it is amiable with a certain goofy charm to it, and there were a couple of moments - entirely daft, to be sure - where I felt like punching the air and shouting ""Yes!"" I left the cinema with a smile on my face and, in my world, that is a recommendation."
" All the goofy, stupid charm of Power Rangers.
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,6,"This is a lesser version of the kid-befriends-and-saves-mysterious-creature-from-evil-adults story...though it's not complete garbage either. The driving is fun, the monsters are cool, the plot is clear. Its biggest issue is the ""hero"", who's dull, whiny, cliched, and pompous. The film certainly isn't great or at all original, but there are much worse things to show your kids."
" I'm not all that impressed.
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,6,"At first, I thought this movie was going to be hilarious and action packed but it simply didn't come through. The simple idea was good but it just really didn't pan out. The plot couldn't figure out if it was going to be happy go lucky, a fantasy, a coming of age, or an action movie. Also, using sub-par actors didn't help those facts either. While a simple minded kid may enjoy the movie, regular adults probably won't. Maybe I'm thinking too critical about it because of its intended audience which was kids but it wasn't anything special. The idea is good though which is why I didn't rate it any worse. Get back to the drawing board and maybe this could be something that mounts to a good flick."
" Great CGI but Tacky Heroism
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,6,"6.5/10It would be fun to watch in first time, especially in the theater, so thrilled to watch an adventure story with flying cars and strange intelligent creatures. The monster even looks cute after getting used of its tentacles. Its visual effect was avant-garde, still looking awesome after a year.However, the plot is cliche, it is a typical heroism presentation. What I disliked the most is not the car crushing and explosion, it was the way how the lead character, Tripp, he rudely treat others who trying to be nice to him, especially his girlfriend and the fat friend. Heroism movie is always giving the wrong subconscious to people that an ordinary person can get something special one day, and win everything after a 'victory', and everyone around is willing to help without logic.Roast (Spoilers)
In beginning, the rich nerd classmate (lately-girlfriend) offered Tripp help in a study group because Tripp was in bad grade, and Tripp was not appreciated but showed annoying. Later, the girl unconditionally helped and supported Tripp tools and even followed him to the monster saving plan. This script is so bad, as a girl, I always feel so sick when I see a smart pretty (and rich!) girl threw herself on a guy that looks social awkward and has no strength. Grossly distorted character's setting, reduced female's IQ, just need a pretty face and a cheesy romantic story, and I don't even know where's the chemistry.Anyway, this movie is fun to watch in somehow, if you want to watch an action movie with great CGI, this can be a choice.Thanks for reading my review, just some random gripes that came to mind."
" Fun movie
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,9,"I saw this movie when I was travelling to New York on a plane and I really enjoyed the movie.
This movie was absolutely fun especially with when the alien was fixing the chase scene. 
The acting was good. This film is definitely no Dragon Ball evolution. 
The CGI was very awesome and the story was cleaver. 
Overall very fun."
" An Underrated Film
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,8,"I like to consider myself a connoisseur of movies. I've watched so many of the classics that I can pick out a good movie from a mile away.
I watched this movie with my family and genuinely appreciated it. I expected Monster Trucks to be childish and tiresome, however, I almost immediately realized that I was going to love it. I have never liked kid's movies, so I was skeptical when my little sister insisted we watch this one. The humor was just adult enough to make me laugh along side her. Besides that the creature and the lead guy are both cute!! What more can you ask for in a child's movie? 
After I watched it, I looked it up online and was horrified to find it such a major flop. What, after all was wrong with it? It was so much better than any of the recent movies I have watched that were child-like. 
Anyway, my family and I loved this movie and will watch it many times in the 
future! I recommend it to not only the children who will love it, but any body who loves trucks and good humor as much as we do!"
" The future holds a tiny piece of the past
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,8,"This movie was a trip to memory lane. It's a modern version of movies such as E.T., Bigfoot and any other eighties and nineties movies where a kid finds and protects an alien (or other kind of creature) from a government or any other association. So it's not anything new, story wise, but it brings a whole new take to the genre. I really loved Creech and its childlike behavior and the chemistry between Creech and Tripp and Meredith. The action scenes looked great! The scene where they are chased through the town and make their escape by jumping the train was great to look at.It's not a movie with great depth but it doesn't require to be. I've seen movies with more depth that really sucked. This one is so underrated and deserves more credit!Great job, Chris Wedge!"
" Monster mash
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,4,My son went to see this film with his friends and they left before the film finished yet they were the target audience!The film is not great but it is family friendly and cheesy with not too good special effects. It lacks the bombast as well as the verve of the Transformer films.High school teenager Tripp (Lucas Till) works part time in a junkyard when he finds a large slimy creature that consumes oil and takes shelter in the hood of a truck which the monster can control.The oil company whose fracking activities unleashed the monster have sent a team to hunt it down as Tripp with a high school friend Meredith try to evade them. They get help from Tripp's mom's boyfriend who is the sheriff and get hindered by Tripp's dad.The film has a pro green agenda but the script is a bit dumb and so is the lead actor.
" Terrible movie
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,2,"Not very good at all. It was actually a pretty stupid and pointless movie with the sole intention of political propaganda. The only redeeming quality is the cuteness factor of the CGI sea creatures. Some political extremist groups must be sending people here to give all these positive reviews. Seriously, it is a terrible movie, for any age viewer. The CGI was cute, and the clichÃ© family togetherness scene at the end was sorta redeeming, but I'm really not into showing movies to my kids that are neck deep in political extremist propaganda.Nothing in this is worth seeing. Just pass."
" No turning back now...
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,7,"In a North Dakota oil town, a creature is discovered and let loose. It finds its way into Tripp's (Lucas Till) truck which he modifies. There is also a girl involved (Jane Levy) and the evil oil company who want to eliminate the creatures because oil is more profitable.The film is on the order of ET. If your son is tired of you dragging him to see films about a princess, try this one. There is plenty of wanton destruction and irresponsible behavior to satisfy most boys. Or you can wait as this will be in the bargain bin shorty. ""Big Miracle"" is better.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity."
" Two thumbs and four giant wheels up for MONSTER TRUCKS!
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,10,"Not just every movie gets me so excited and pumped up as to just rush to IMDb and write it a positive review, but Monster Trucks sure is one of those rare cases! Seeing the trailer and knowing that this is a NIckelodeon movie I expected a good, fun, family friendly flick with a likable creature, but my expectations were quite surpassed. The movie really is all of the above-mentioned, but it just shines with a lot of positivism and heart. The creature-truck concept is really original, while the story is your classical coming-of-age, boy-against-world, boy-meets-girl, boy-comes-to-terms-with-step-dad- who-in-the-end-turns-out-to-be-a-decent-nice-guy, and of course, most of all, boy-and-unusual-out-of-this-world-friend kind of story. Some may call these themes repetitive, I call them eternal and engaging when done in the right way, and the cast and the director all do a lovely job to bring out the emotional charge in this one. Not to mention that Creech is extremely lovable from his very first appearance in the film, the effects are believable and quite well done, and the CGI is never overused as to overwhelm the scene. There is plenty of spectacle, plenty of action and some really fun (even if kinda guilty pleasure) scenes of destruction and smashing stuff. The humor is there too, and it never crosses any boundaries, no crude jokes or anything to really worry about. I would totally watch this film again, but this time with my two little daughters. This movie is like TREMORS meets FREE WILLY! It made me feel like a 10- year-old again and I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially if you're into stories about unusual friendships such as ""The Iron Giant"", ""E.T."", ""Lilo and Stitch"", ""The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep"", etc. Two thumbs and four giant wheels up for MONSTER TRUCKS!"
" Good for kids up to 11-13
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,5,"The story is simple, not a smart one, not a funny one (ok, a bit). Just a simple story for an evening entertainment. Not a great story to be taught. Several months passed since we watched this, only 3 years old boy somehow remembers the monster truck, the rest of kids never discussed it, what I see is quite bad for such a budget."
" Could do better
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,6,"So I saw Monster Trucks... (reasons OK) and its actually quite a technically well made kids movie that steals shamelessly from other better kids movies. The casting is weird and at times its taking itself a bit too seriously, but what gets me is the unnecessary plot holes joining the stolen bits together. Plot holes that you see coming a mile down the road, easily avoided, but they just drive on in. I get that its ""just a kids movie"" but if they put a fraction of the effort they went to with the FX into the script... it would still be a kids movie I guess... just more of a How to Train You Dragon movie as apposed to a Transformers movie."
" Really fun, entertaining adventure
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,8,"This movie deserves a lot more of a chance: it's an adorable adventure story that has the feel of the live-action Disney films from the 1970s and 80s. The story is fun, implausible, but as far as sci-fi storytelling goes, it's entertaining enough to deserve a certain amount of suspension of disbelief. The acting is good, with likable characters. The creatures/CGI are pretty great, and it's definitely a good family flick. This is an overall great ride!"
" If this was a cartoon, ratings would be higher
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,7,"I'm not exactly sure what people were expecting from this movie. It's not going to be the height of drama, and it's not going to have intense action. It's a movie for pre-teen kids, and as that it hits its mark quite well.An oil company discovers pre-historic creatures while drilling. While trying to cover up, one gets away and hides with Tripp (Lucas Till). Tripp learns that they can power his engineless truck and then goes about trying to save the creatures.Simple story, but well told. If you're an adult without children, this movie likely isn't for you. However, if you have young kids it'll be an enjoyable hour and a half."
" Good movie for adults and children alike
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,9,"This movie is a comedy, romance, and action movie combined. The comedy and action are the two most prominent categories that this movie could be put into. I rated this movie a nine due to the graphics and because its ending could be sad to some children. I think that overall, the acting was great considering that the actors are having to respond to a computer animated animal that they could not see, or hear, or touch. The movie's ending would probably leave most adults satisfied because it was realistic; the monster, Creech, has to go back to his family and cannot stay with Tripp. I like how it provides viewers with a realistic interpretation of how kids would respond to being in a broken family, with their parents living with other people. Some parents might not want their children to see a family like that, but it is realistic. I would recommend this movie to the families of my friends and relatives, as well as others looking for a good family movie in order to pass the time."
" All around great movie!
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,10,"What an awesome movie! I loved it! Terrific cast! Great story concept! The creatures intelligence was amazing! Hopefully a part 2 is being considered! The best family movie since Free Willie! A little bit of everything, endangered species, monster trucks, romance, family and fun! This is a movie I recommend to all my family and friends of all ages and all genders!"
" Communism anyone?
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,1,"Just another in a long line of movies aimed at ramming anti-capitalism down the throats of America's youth. Once again, the ""evil"" company is out to destroy the world, your life, all animals, and any other thing that stands in their way of absolute world domination.Plus, almost everything else about this movie sucks.....acting, special effects, plot....garbage."
" Better than most modern movies!
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,9,"I know I might seem biased to Lucas till stuff,but he is a good actor! Anyway,this movie was greatly enjoyable,and the action was beautifully done! Creech was an adorable character,you have to be heartless to dislike him! Thomas Lennon(Felix from the odd couple)was very funny in this,especially his sweating problem,which was very enjoyable! Everything just fits,so you must watch this enjoyable family-friendly movie!"
" Old school family-movie with modern effects
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,8,"A young man encounters a creature that that has been removed from its habitat by a drilling company. The creature ends up living in the mans truck. The rest pretty much speaks for itself.This is a modern film with great effects and acting; but, saying that, it takes a very classic approach. This could easily be mistaken for ""Karate Kid"" or ""Free Willy"" in another guise.The well worn footpaths are used to great affect - there are even some montages to cheesy rock music.The characters are templated from other movies, the love interest is particularly predictable. The bad guys are an evil petroleum firm that will stop at nothing to capture the ultra-cute creature.All this familiarity means that that the film doesn't have to waste time explaining what's going on - we already know.This is a solid family movie with dashes of action, comedy, romance, and heart warming moments. It is aimed at keeping the kids quiet, don't expect sharp adult humour woven amongst the bright, fast moving scenes. It does exactly what it to set out to do, so I have to commend all involved for that."
" Very intentional film, but could not deliver!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,6,"There are lots of similarities with other films, maybe not directly. In todays world, it became practice to give kids (and sometimes for women) their own version of what meant for only grownups. So there's no use whining about that. Because those who does might not be the target audience. This is I think purely for kids, otherwise it would have not got bold PG, but like usual for any film, I gave it a try. Even though it's not original, somewhat I enjoyed watching it.The story was in usual pattern that opened with an intro, then moving to unleash the long trapped ancient creatures into the human society. One becomes friend with it and a few starting to hunt it with the rest are as the neutral or unaware of it. There's nothing unpredictable in it. And so the tale comes to halt with a finale where maximum push was given, but overall it fails to impress on the average expectation.Good title, good idea, even the graphics were not bad, but not good enough stunts with okay performances. I feel it could have become a good television series than the film. So they should scrap the idea if they have one for a sequel and instead make a shift to television. Other than what I thought, this is a good entertainer for little kids. So it should be watched by them more than their counterparts.5Â½/10"
" Would've been better without the clichÃ©s
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,5,"I was a pain to watch the main male flat out ignore the pretty main female that was lusting for him. The main guy lust for a douche bag rival's girlfriend(who choose douche in the first place). The teen angst against the crappy(was he really crappy) stepfather, when the dad was really the arsehole. The main guy looks like Sam(from Supernatural).My biggest gripe was, why didn't the oil company just turn what they found into a giant Jurassic park sort of thing. they would've raked in billions a year."
" Kid movie
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,8,"Watched Monster trucks today with my five year old son and we both loved it. He was pretty much glued to the screen the entire time and he got a bit teary at the end! From the creator of ice age bring you a great little quirk film Monster trucks that will touch you heart & bring you to tears & laughter , this film truly is one of the guilty pleasure film that a across ET meet Herbie that you sure will love.At the start of the film, Terravex Oil is in the midst of a fracking operation near a lake in North Dakota. The operation releases three subterranean creatures and destroys the drilling rig. Two are captured by Terravex, but one of them escapes the site. One night, Tripp encounters the escaped creature in the junkyard and captures it but the creature escapes before he calls the police. The next day Tripp finds that the creature has a diet of oil and it takes shelter within the hood of his truck, quickly befriending him naming him Creech and promising to help him get home. Tripp modifies the truck to give Creech more control over the truck as a makeshift engine and Meredith becomes quite impressed and surprised at the Creech's speed and talent. They decide that to protect the company's image the right thing by sending hired mercenary Burke to kill the creatures, to the objection of Jim Dowd, as he finds the monsters have human intelligence. When Creech gets the sense that something bad will become of the other creatures, who are actually his parents, he breaks into Terravex where the other creatures are being held captive and is also captured.Sympathetic to the creatures plight, Jim decides to help Tripp and Meredith rescue the creatures. They get the help of two friends of theirs to get two more trucks, one being a repossession from a friend of Tripp's and another being the birthday present of a second friend whose dad owns a local car dealership, so they can modify them for Creech's parents to take control in the same way. Jim helps the group by stealing the Terravex truck the monsters were loaded on. At the dealership, the creatures take control of the modified trucks and the group make their escape up the mountain.Terravex give chase up the mountain and the group escapes by using the trucks to jump over the edge of the mountain. Tripp gets into a head-on battle with Burke who attempts to push him into the drilling hole the creatures crawled out of and Tripp overturns Burke's truck. He and his parents depart back home and Terravex is exposed by the group for the experimentation that was harming the creature's habitat. Reece is arrested and Tripp and Meredith begin a relationship."
" Great movie
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,10,Monster Tracks was a great movie all around it had great acting great animations and a great story line(better than twilight.)

" A Lotta of 80's Fun in a 2017 Teen/Adventure Film
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,9,"First, I read and heard all the insanity and hate for this film by movie reviewers and they are wrong. If they said this movie was bad, quit reading and watching their reviews.This movie is in the same vein as the Goonies, ET, Super 8, and so buddy comedies where friends are all you can depend on when no one will listen to you. Essentially it's a good film, with fun teen characters who are searching simply to NOT be complete losers and the plot ensues.It's a refreshing plot involving monsters in trucks and a very likable cast. It has the likable hero you pull for and an easy to follow plot. All the characters play there roles and this movie is well acted top to bottom.9.5 out of 10. MUST WATCH if a Fan of films like the Goonies, ET, Super 8..."
" The Vidiot Reviews...
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,5,"Monster TrucksMonsters who drive enormous trucks are just compensating for having really small tentacles.The Leviathan in this action-comedy, however, is unable to move without one.Brought to the surface via the drill of an oil company (Rob Lowe, Thomas Lennon) and unable to move due to Earth's gravity, cephalopod Creech (Frank Welker) uses a patchwork truck to get around.When the teenage owner (Lucas Till) discovers this, he agrees to let Creech live there in exchange for some serious off-roading. Meanwhile, the oil firm hires a monster-hunter to locate the new species threatening their project.Not as terrible as expected, or as hoped, this family-friendly creature feature from Nickelodeon actually has some merits in it's monstrous mash-up - mainly its anti-oil stance and absentee father-son dynamic. However, these highlights are not enough to forgive the weak premise.Mind you, monsters driving trucks would be a refreshing change from assholes driving them. Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
" This was the definition of a harmless kid's flick...with that said, it has some dumb things about it.
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,5,"Like I stated in the summary, this is by all means harmless. The film at no point ever really felt like it was talking down to its audience along the lines of something akin to ""Oogieloves"" or last year's ""Norm of the North"". This is more or less a movie trying to launch a toy line, that is more or less what this comes across to me as. ""Monster Trucks"" isn't terrible or even all that bad...but it is pretty dumb and does have a few issues.To give a brief synopsis, the movie is about a creature (later to be named 'Creech') that is accidentally dug up by an oil mining company that's run by Rob Lowe; the creature escapes only to be discovered by a ""teenaged"" boy named Tripp, played by Lucas Till. From there the two get into wacky shenanigans and soon find themselves in a pickle with the oil company a la ""E.T."" To start off I just want to briefly state that the story is fine, extremely unoriginal in every way, but it's fine. The acting is fine, granted very strange casting choices that include Danny Glover, Rob Lowe, Barry Pepper, Frank Whaley, and Holt McCallany...I mean...what are they doing in this movie? I can understand a paycheck movie, but some of these actors are barely in this movie. Danny Glover is in so little of this movie I had forgotten that he was even in it until the last 20 minutes of the movie, at which point he disappears about as fast as he came into it. Rob Lowe is in it maybe a little longer, but still probably rounds out to about seven minutes of screen time...maybe. Pushing the odd bit part casting choices aside though, all around the acting was fine. The CGI ranges from fine to questionable, but nothing ever seemed downright bad, just nothing all that terrific either. And lastly the creature, Creech, is cute and I did find myself routing for it to get back to its home. Even though you know a movie like this is without a doubt going to have a happy ending. My biggest issues are with the characters...everyone is pretty much an idiot. I can get passed everyone basically being dumb in a kids movie like this, it's practically a staple of these types of movies by now. You just have to expect that going in...although there is some illegal things that the oil company AND this lead character, Tripp, is doing but doesn't ever seem to result in any legal consequences...it's like in this universe cops are okay with destruction of public property, total destruction of one's home, attempted kidnapping, and murder. And when I mention murder, I don't mean that is what the villains do in this movie but rather the 'hero'. Yeah...there are some scenarios where there is only one logical outcome and that is that people are more than likely dead. So many car wrecks, explosions, people being crushed by a gigantic work truck, a guy being covered in severely lethal toxic chemicals. The film may not show them ""die"" but you know they did. However, that's all good in their book apparently, but don't you dare make what appears to be a prank call or so help me! Anyways, that kind of dumb stuff is present but it isn't anything I haven't encountered before and I can easily get over. What I can't get over so much though is the lead character, Tripp. Tripp is a manipulative douche. He's rude to his romantic love interest, played by Jane Levy. Throughout this whole movie I am actually kind of feeling sorry for Jane Levy's character because she has a thing for Tripp while all Tripp does is use her for her money, tools and hideout spots that she can supply for him, dismisses her completely in some sequences, and he is constantly ogling at this other girl that pops in from time to time. But by the end, of course the two get together, but I'm left sitting there asking ""why"". Now I'd like to clarify that I don't have a problem with the performance that Lucas Till is giving as his character Tripp...stupid frikkin' name...anyway, I just have a problem with how he is written. If he were written to be more likable, but could still retain some his nativity towards Levy's crush on him then that's fine. But he mainly comes across as a jerk that I don't want to wind up with this likably innocent, cutely played girl though. Alright, so those are my major gripes. Would I recommend it? Hmm...I suppose if you have little kids and you're flipping through channels or on Netflix and you come across this then it won't be too bad to show them. It would make your children dumber or insult your intelligence, but it won't be anything all that memorable. I highly doubt that any child that watches this will carry this with them into their adulthood. This will probably be shortly forgotten, if it hasn't been already. It's fine, but I'm positive that you can find better."
" A fun movie for all ages
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,7,"Why do some people criticize this movie so much? They find fault with holes in the plot, poor acting and a host of other reasons, forgetting one thing. This movie does exactly what it is meant to be. A fun movie for all ages.If a movie entertains children and adults alike, it certainly succeeds as a family movie. Sure, I found the beginning a bit slow which may stop tiny tots watching, but once the monster truck gets to work the fun really begins, thrilling the whole family.Not all movies are only for adults. Check the genre which will give an indication what to expect. I purposefully avoid comedies, which I find mostly silly, but a movie classified as a mixture of Action/Adventure/Animation/Comedy/Family/Fantasy/Sci-Fi has never failed me to enjoy.I give this movie a solid 7/10."
" Come on guys give some rating
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,10,I don't know why people are criticising this movie not a bad one i never get bored while watching this movie.Why low rating for this movie i have seen much movies on IMDb which have low plot we can say average but their rating are higher.Don't understand the mind of the people and on what criteria they judge the movie on the other hand they rate much more violence movies which have no message or moral lesson.
" A lot of money spend on a boy and his dog that transforms into a car.
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,3,"This movie targets a very limited audience and according to me does it badly. I think this is for boys age 6 to 9 and it is strange that they spend a 125 million budget on this and dropped it in the worst month of the year.It felt like in some ways like an old Disney feel good movie with some really odd choices in character development. A lot of the more famous actors are not convincing in their roles or just have to little to do to really add to the film. The 2 main characters played off and on dumb and that really annoyed me in the first part of the movie a specially the guy who came across like a jerk who everybody just seem to like for no reason other than he's the main character.The creature or ""monster"" was to cute for it's own good and knowing it sucked up oil as ""food"" I found it strange it actually had sharp teeth. I guess this was an attempt to make it more look like a monster but I found it to be quite silly.Also I felt the guy and the girl were to old for these roles and it would have been good for them if this movie got rated PG-13 and they took the high school bit out of it.The best thing and scene is with the monster trucks and the action scene of them going down this mountain was the most fun but don't come close of saving this film and all the problems it has.The writer for this also worked on Kong and I think he has a real problem with writing characters unless it are creatures or monsters that don't talk to much.For half of it it was a nice feel good movie for young kids and sort of succeeded as that but it definitely bombed spending all that money on this premise.Strangely enough this made me think of ""passengers"" where they also spend a lot of money on a weak story and not that exciting when it actually ends and again not nearly enough to spend 100+ million on.Both films are also not bad but really too lame to leave an impact and appeal to a mass audience as a classic or a movie at least worthy of watching twice.I don't recommend it or maybe some time when it's on T.V. and more as background.On to the next review,thank you."
" Happy energetic movie to watch with my 9 year old
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,9,"What a nice movie! There are plenty of little jokes, energetic (but not gory) action, a believable but not too dark enemy.Most importantly, this movie is very appropriate for boys. It is unashamed in its love of trucks and motors. Most movies have a ham-handed romance which a boy in this age group is not at all interested in. This movie just hints at it. Also, this movie for once shows the girl pining for the guy (if only a little bit). I was happy to see this normalization of gender relationships.And the adult characters! The parents were actually present. Far too many kid shows have no adult role models at all. Here we have the stepdad who steps up and in a quiet way helps our protagonists reach their goal. If I get into bio-dad I would probably reach spoiler territory, but ""all that glitters is not gold"" is an important lesson to learn.All in all this was one of the more enjoyable movies I've taken the kids to. I hope they keep making films like this."
" Very exciting film with all the perks...
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,10,"This movie by the king of children's television really deserves a new regal stamp of approval from me. This movie's was filled of fun, action, romance, and subtlety. The storyline was pretty easy for a kid to understand and the fact that it was about monster trucks and aliens, it is E.T meeting Blaze and the Monster Machines. It is a fun family film for everyone to enjoy and really has a really vivid way of telling story through the eyes of Tripp and Creech trying to save their families! An awesome movie for everyone to enjoy and really Nickeledon deserves a round of applause for bringing us this original tale of love, faith, trust, friendship and above all, MONSTER JAM ACTION!"
" sorta like the old Disney movies
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,5,"Scientist Jim Dowd (Thomas Lennon) and thuggish Burke work for Reece Tenneson (Rob Lowe) and his oil drilling company. Their drilling unleashes a monster. It escapes to a garage owned by Mr. Weathers (Danny Glover) where Tripp Coley (Lucas Till) is working on his junk truck. When Burke and his men barge in searching for the creature, it hides under Tripp's truck. Tripp and his tutor Meredith (Jane Levy) escape in the monster-powered truck. His mother Cindy (Amy Ryan) is dating Sheriff Rick (Barry Pepper). His father Wade Coley (Frank Whaley) works as a driller. Meanwhile, Dowd is working with another monster that they have captured.The premise is sorta like the old Disney movies such as Herbie The Love Bug. It is silly but the point is to have fun with it. At the end of the day, I can't get over the stupidity. The high octane action gets repetitive. The romance needs more time to set up before the monster truck takes off. There is plenty of top level acting power but they can't rise above the material. Lucas Till is very pretty but his romantic instincts are limited. Jane Levy could be a fun partner if he is more capable. The monster does split the uprights between being cute while still monstrous. I was expecting this to be a high school movie but it's skewed more towards battling the big, bad oil driller. This is fun for awhile until it gets a bit boring. The story and the side characters aren't compelling enough and the movie seems to be trying to substitute them with long action sequences."
" Most fun I've had in a theatre in a long time
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,10,"If you've seen the trailers for this you know exactly what this movie is about. It is a fun, action-packed, fun, hilarious, FUN MOVIE. The creatures are the perfect mix of cute and intimidating. The characters that you think are just going to be one-dimensional stereotypes are actually given depth that makes them believable. This movie sets up a lot of clichÃ© situations and then surprises you by doing the opposite. It was such a breath of fresh air from the usually cookie cutter sequels/remakes that have been dominating the box office lately and I can't rate it highly enough.This is a film that knows exactly how ridiculous its concept is going in and plays it perfectly. It doesn't take the ""monsters in trucks"" idea too seriously and try to make a gritty action film out of it, but it never gets too over-the top either. It goes over the top all the time but not TOO over the top, if you know what I mean, and its aware of its over-the-topness and never goes far enough to be cringy, just funny and enjoyable. It's kind of like a toned-down Sharknado or something, except the script, acting, and CGI are all WAY better.Really the only thing I can think to criticize in this film is the score. Most of the music seemed like just the most generic public- domain orchestral stuff that just seemed out of place in a lot of scenes. It wasn't bad enough to be distracting, but it was still noticeable.Overall, i recommend this film to anyone. Kids will love it, and adults will get a good laugh out of it too. A fun time all around. I'm really glad i saw it!"
" Great fun, far fetched but so what!
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"My son in-law and I took my 6 yr old grandson (his son) and we had a fun time. He loved the movie, we loved the movie. There were a few times when most of the audience cheered and laughed, something you don't often hear these days. The monster is ugly but lovable, the plot is typical and impossible. The special effects are good and have you believing in this weird creature. There are no real terrifying part to this movie and it is not all about the hero gets his girl or too grown up for the little ones. There is just plain fun for all who go if you let the kid in you watch more than the adult. If your grandchild is going, go with them and just enjoy them as much as the movie."
" Great Movie - Not Serious but Fun to Watch
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"I don't know why people think this is so bad. You have to remember it is aimed at kids, but it is reminiscent of Free Willy and the Loch Ness Monster films that are similar. It is cute and endearing with a sweet message. It has a fun plot with a lot of laughs, a cute monster and some action and adventure. It is lighthearted and easy to watch.It is not going to win any awards but the acting and CGI are all pretty decent, as is the script ! I think this is a great watch if you want to go and see a lighthearted comedy or a movie with the kids. It is strong enough to keep adults entertained as well !The family of monsters are especially comical as they behave like big slimy dogs !"
" Best creature film since ET
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Awesome film, with something for everyone, lots of very funny scenes, tonnes of great stunts, good family themes and plot, and even the Monster truck fans will love the outragous actions of Creech and the trucks.So while the world and everyone is worried about idiots, terrorists and Armageddon...along comes a great film like this to brighten the outlook of the world....should be more films like this! This film had the same feel that I got back in the 80s watching ET for the first time.The film is fantastically rounded, and a film where every character gets exactly what they deserve, that leaves the viewer satisfied that there is still Kama and justice in the world.You walk away from the cinema thinking I got good value for money on that film.Enjoy"
" If you saw E.T. and Earth to Echo then you have already saw this movie.
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Am I gonna say Monster Trunks is bad, well yeah but it's entertainingly bad, I found such enjoyment out of it to the point where I couldn't give it a low rating, it's pretty much nearly the same as story has E.T. and Earth to Echo. The effects are alright, and action scenes are pretty descent.Now the two leads Lucas Til and Jane Levy(Don't Breathe) are pretty effective, but there playing teenagers, and they look to old to play teenagers, they look young but not young enough to play teenagers. A cameo by Rob Lowe goes nowhere. This is good little adventure movie, never tries to be great."
" Monster Trucks is bad, but it at least knows that only kids will enjoy this
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,4,"Don't you often wonder how certain movies get pitched? For today's movie, I can only imagine it went down something like this, Executive 1: Have you watched Monster Jam recently?Executive 2: No. I don't watch that stuffExecutive 1: My little boy was playing with his Hot Wheels and asked about a movie.Executive 2: You think kids will go for it?Executive 3: Have you seen their toy profits? A film would be a cash grab!Executive 2: We don't own the rights to either Hot Wheels or Monster JamExecutive 1: That's okay, we can just fictionalize itExecutive 2: But we can't just show monster trucks for an hour and a halfExecutive 1: HmmÂ… what if we incorporated it into a robot story?Executive 2: You mean like Transformers?Executive 1: OhÂ…your right. Too similar. How about an alien?Executive 2: Like E.T.?Executive 1: Exactly! Our hero will find him in the truck, and the alien will be able to move the car around like a monster truck.Executive 2: I like it! It could end with a bunch of monster trucks doing the same thing.Executive 1: We'll call it Monster Trucks!Executive 1 & 2: Greenlit!In North Dakota (which it's clearly not with mountains and lakes in the setting), a high school student Trip (played by Lucas Till) works at a junkyard to save up for his dream to simply leave. Meanwhile at a nearby oil drilling site, an underground water system is discovered that also unleashes a monster of some kind. Manager of the oil site, Reece Tenneson (played by Rob Lowe) orders for the creature to be found to prevent the press to find out about the fracking about to be pulled off illegally. While working to getaway from his mother Cindy (played by Amy Ryan) and her boyfriend sheriff Rick (played by Barry Pepper), Trip discovers the creature that he names Creech. The squid-like monster turns out to be playful, like a kid version of it's species. Trip also sees that Creech like to hide out in a truck that he's been working on. He and fellow student Meredith (played by Jane Levy) manage to out run the oil companies security firm when they come looking for the creature. Tripp makes a bunch of adjustments to his truck so that Creech can make high jumps, wall climbing, and pretty much anything to make it a monster truck.Where do I begin with this one? It's said that this film had been sitting on the shelves at Paramount Studios and I can see why. Apart from having a creative but standard story, the choices made are strange. Both actors playing our high school leads are clearly in their late twenties, so I don't know why they simply didn't change the script to make them college-aged. Even if that was the case, both have little to no personality which makes them boring to watch. The majority of the performances are stale, including an underused Rob Lowe.You must think that Monster Trucks must be one of the worst movies right? WellÂ…I'll say that I was disappointed. Not because I had high expectations, but lower ones. Creech does have a lot of personality and even some of the truck stunts are fun to look at. I think that if I was seven, I would have gotten a kick out of it. The problem is that the film is clearly made for kids, and if I had a child that wanted to watch it as a time killer, I wouldn't object as it doesn't have any bad morals; just a premise that adults will simply find too juvenile.I'll give this two monster trucks out of five. Honestly, the film is meant to be kids entertainment rather then family entertainment. It knows what its for and tries to give it's audience a fun time. I certainly didn't, but the kids in my theater seemed to enjoy themselves. I'd say this is something to save for Netflix or ITunes rather then the movies. Let the kids start their engines and the parents can stay in the garage."

" OK, but leftist Hollywood cant help themselves (SPOILER)
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,4,"The movie was a very simple story line. Yes, kids might enjoy the movie. The following may be seen as a spoiler. Make a big look creature that has an appearance of being cute, kinda looks a lot like the monster in the CG animated movie 'How to train your dragon', only instead of flying, it rides underneath the hood of a truck, hence the term 'monster truck'. The parts of the movie that I despise is how Hollywood can not seem to make a movie where they have to interject their twisted hatred of something, or anything that that they seem to act on the surface that they hate. In this movie, it had to be the 'mean oil companies' that they just had to make the 'bad guys' who want to kill all the cute monsters to make a buck. Hollywood loves to make either conservatives in government the bad guys, or oil companies, or hunters, or gun owners,or any other group they choose to make look bad. It just gets under our skins when they can't even leave it out of a kids movie. They have no end to how low they won't stoop, or how far they won't go to show they have no shame. Next, they'll make a movie with little pink knitted hats and they'll be the superheroes."

" It's not a bad carspolation movie.
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,6,"I did get a small sense of enjoyment cause of the trucks featured in it. It's not the Fast and the Furious, it's no The Transformers, in fact I'm still wondering just how this film got made. My guess it has to do with the really cool trucks that make an small but impactful appearance. The story was not bad. According to the film, 15,000 new species are discovered in a year and this movie is about one vastly intelligent on that's a cross between whale and octopus that gets discovered while an evil business man (Played by Rob Lowe) was drilling for oil. A kid who wants a car, befriends one of these creatures and uses it as a engine for his truck.The movie spends a lot of time watching this kid turn a monster into a Truck. I'm usually into this. Like when Tony Stark was developing the Iron Man suit but the guy who plays Havak in the X-Men movies only has the looks and not the personality like Robert Downing Jr has.It was all too dull at times as we watch him go through the stereotypes of being a rebellious teen who hates his moms new boy toy and does not see the pretty girl who likes him.But all the nonsense of the picture was almost worth it to see the cool monster trucks that were created for the grand finale. They were really cool and I would be down to see this film get a sequel in hopes that I might get cooler cars in the future."

The two also team up, to save the creature (and others like it), from ruthless businessmen. It was written by Derek Connolly, Mathew Robinson, Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger. The movie stars â€‹Lucas Till (of 'X-MEN' fame), Jane Levy (of 'DON'T BREATHE' and 'EVIL DEAD' fame), Thomas Lennon, Barry Pepper, Rob Lowe, Holt McCallany, Amy Ryan, Frank Whaley and Danny Glover. It was made on a budget of $125 million, and it's only expected to make a fraction of that back (in theaters). It's also gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, but I really enjoyed it! Tripp Coley (Till) lives in a small North Dakota town, which is ran by big business (a ruthless oil company). He hates his mom's boyfriend, who's also the town's sheriff (Pepper), and he really wants to leave town. Tripp is also fascinated by automobiles, and he builds himself a monster truck (out of old scrapped car parts) to leave town in. The truck still needs an engine though. One night, while he's working on his truck, Tripp finds an undiscovered subterranean creature resting nearby. He then befriends it, and names it Creech. He also learns that the creature loves speed, and it can power his truck just like an engine could. Tripp also later learns that the ruthless oil businessmen want to catch Creech, and kill him, as well as other subterranean critters like it (which the oil company accidentally let loose). Tripp teams up with Creech, and a friendly girl from school (Levy), to save this new species.The movie is a lot of fun; the visuals are great, the critters are cool, and the action scenes are entertaining. It's also kind of an animal rights movie, so I love it automatically for that, but it's also reminiscent of other classic 'boy befriends alien' (or animal) kids movies. It's definitely the type of film I would have loved as a kid, and the cast is all great in it. I also think Wedge is a pretty talented director, at making awesome animated (or partially animated) kids movies. I really don't understand the negative reviews!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc"
" A load of cheesy good for nothing stupidity
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,4,"I was never planning to see Monster Trucks. I had no desire to see this silly film and after seeing it I absolutely regret it. This film can only be watched through a child's eye. I saw it in a packed theater filled with kids and yea kids loved it. They had a good time with it. And I am happy for those kids, but for older kids and young adults this film adds nothing but mindless stupidity with a weird save the Whales thing I felt that it had going on. What do I mean by that?Well the creature put inside the trucks are these weird whale like creatures who go under the water. No there not actually whales, but they just really resemble them, but with the add on that they look really ugly. I mean this film does a lot to try and make them cute, but there not. They have weird tentacles and these strange teeth and there just wrong in every way. Also the acting in this film is god awful. I mean I don't get why some kids films have to make all there characters this over the top. If you have kids under 12 years old then they might enjoy it, but anyone older than that has no chance of liking the steaming pile of garbage."
" Lucas Till saves this movie
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,3,"First the good - my 7 1/2 year-old grandson said he LOVED this movie. So from his point of view, it's a 10.My 9 1/2 year-old granddaughter liked it.As an adult viewer, I found Lucas Till's acting to be the only saving grace. IMO he (like Steve McQueen in ""The Blob"") has a great charisma on screen and helped me suspend disbelief of the truly ridiculous and formulaic plot.The photography was truly terrible, very non-hi-def like TV from 1960! I regret wasting money on 3D, nothing in 3D really jumped out at you at all!! The ""monster"" reminded me in a way of ""Toothless"" from ""How To Train Your Dragon"".But again, this movie is mainly targeted for little boys, and it's a hit with them."
" Monster Trucks C-
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,4,"When looking at at trailer for ""Monster Trucks,"" you can easily say that it looks like any other poorly made January cash grab. However, ""Monster Trucks"" will surprise audiences by being a bit more than that. Although the over-the-top performances and the poor camera work isn't ideal, ""Monster Trucks"" is mediocre enough that its target audience can get behind it. Adults have the opportunity to find enjoyment out of ""Monster Trucks"" if they accept the movie for what it is. As for the creature in the movie, the CGI isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't up to par with other family movies in recent memory. The movie relies more on the personality of the creature instead of how the creature actually looks."
" Good, fun flick for all ages
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,9,"Not sure why so many are hating on this one, or basing reviews on what happened before it got to screen.Took my 4-, 8-, 12-year-olds to see it on Saturday. All three of them enjoyed it, and I did, too. Simple enough story for the kids to understand, with little in the way of violence, profanity, sex to battle through. Acting was good, as was the CGI. don't go in expecting The Godfather or anything -- but for a family-friendly flick with a good message, this serves its purpose extremely well. The ""monsters"" are cute enough for the most part and, when they bare their teeth, it's Star Wars-level ""scary"", if that makes sense.Overall, check it out."
" At Least It's Got a Good Message (Shrug)
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,7,"I am not going to lie; I was sold on this film before I even walked into the theater. WhyÂ…well why the hell not? While most denizens of this year's January Graveyard crop have been ludicrously dour and pitifully boring, Monster Trucks looked like it was going to lean into its silly high-concept and provide enough stupid fun for all. Plus a handful of such obvious marketing ploys have been sold to the public in the past and have still managed to be good even if they were armed with preposterous story elements.Turns out I was partially right (though mostly wrong) about Monster Trucks. In this film's defense at least it has the presence of mind to steal from the best. Just switch the adorable alien from E.T. (1982) with an oil guzzling tentacled stress ball from beneath the surface of the earth, and Amblin Entertainment might just have cause to sue. But I suppose you could also replace Elliott with a characteristically blasÃ© Lucas Till as our nominal human lead. Suddenly the whimsy has been halved, so I guess suing would just be kicking them while they're down. Am I supposed to be brooding or smoldering here?Monster Trucks also has the presence of mind to include a rollicking hook to its second rate story. Our monster, Creech makes it a habit to hide in our leading man's scrap-heap pickup truck. A habit he gained while avoiding capture from a nefarious oil company looking to cover up any evidence of a looming eco-disaster. From that point forward it's a Ratatouille (2008)-type scenario where driver and monster work together, gleefully off-roading towards the film's inevitable conclusion. Along for the ride is the nerdy Meredith (Levy) whose, quite frankly, unbelievable infatuation with Tripp (Till) cajoles her to the junkyard in the middle of the night wearing knee-high bobby socks.Yeah a lot about this movie makes no sense. Like why a geologist (Lennon) would be doing intelligence tests and experiments on captured monsters? How do our leads get out of answering for so much property damage? And why, oh why would Rob Lowe, Amy Ryan and Danny Glover agree to be in this movie?Yet every time I ask myself these sorts of questions the movie wisely slides in some ridiculous CGI car stunt or some awkward corny joke. I'm then reminded of the spirit of this film. It's supposed to be silly, it's supposed to be goofy and while I'm not a fan of using ""kids movie"" in a pejorative sense, the pro-environmental message of the film is just enough for the film to squeak by on its merits.Monster Trucks is not a great movie. It's not even a good movie and certainly not the movie it could or should have been. But it's still the movie we got, and what we ended up getting was a movie about a monster that lives inside a monster truck. No bull, it's as advertised just as it is on the box."
" If you like Dodge commercials, this is the perfect movie for you
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,3,"I would have given it 4 stars if they at least made the bad guys' trucks Ford's. Aside from this basically being an overly extended Dodge Ram commercial, the acting was so terrible, the plot so unbelievable, you would have to have the IQ of a turnip if over the age of 12 to think this was a quality movie. I can appreciate suspending your disbelief for a certain genre of movie, but only to a certain extent. For example, having a high school character portrayed by someone who looks to be in their mid twenties working in a junk yard in the middle of the night, operating heavy machinery up to a car crusher. Or having a drill site go boom without an investigation that would reveal 3 giant underground sea creatures came up."
" Worth watching...It's not a remake, not a reboot and not based on existing material.
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"I want to commend the filmmakers on this film. There was a lot of bad press about it even coming from the studio as writing it off as a loss before it was even released. My kids (11 and 8) have been wanting to see it since we saw a trailer ages ago. I thought the concept was a bit crazy, but it did seem like fun. After reading that Paramount was already writing it down as a loss, pretty much told me the movie must not be that good. I didn't want to not take my kids just because of that. Cut to today. We saw the fist showing this morning. I have to say the movie was a lot of fun. It called back to films from the 80's when I was a little film-goer. Director Chris Wedge really made a fun film that has monsters and trucks, it truly lived up to it's title. I feel like he (the director) was really pulling from films like the Explorers, Flight of the Navigator, and a bit of Gremlins. Funny, action packed and not long for the sake of being long like so many movies today. It told a cute story and let us on our way. About halfway through the movie, I realized why I was enjoying it. It was not something from another property, no comic book characters, it wasn't a sequel. It was something to get wrapped up in and enjoy. I just wanted to say that we really enjoyed it and I hope more people give it a chance. It's not going to solve the world's problems, but it's certainly going to entertain you. First thing my 11- year-old said after it was over was, ""Can we see this again tomorrow?"" Not sure if there is a better admission of how fun it was. Very fun!"
" Great for Little Boys *Spoilers*
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"You know that when you see the Nickelodeon logo in the beginning that you're not going to get Shakespeare. As adults, we have seen the friendship duo against the corporate baddie flick a million times, and we're kind of jaded to it. However, watching this with a 5-year old whose never seen anything like this before is a lot of fun. All of this was completely new to to him, and he had a blast. His eyes were riveted to the screen the whole time. However, walking out, my very bright 5-year-old son was pointing out some plot holes, but he still said this was the best movie he's ever seen, along with Jurassic World. In short, you've seen this a million times, but your young kids haven't"
" A two hour long Dodge commercial about the mean old oil company.
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,3,"My wife and I took our two sons to this film based on the previews we had seen recently at the theater. The preview looked so awesome. A kid who befriends a monster that he uses to drive his ""monster truck"". Finally a breath of fresh air, we thought.The first thing that became painfully obvious was the placement of Dodge trucks everywhere. You would think that the movie took place on some planet where Dodge was the only company that manufactured a truck.The second observation is that the story is supposed to take place in North Dakota. The scenery in this film is beautiful, but be warned, do not come to North Dakota to see these landscapes. I know this because I live in North Dakota. Please, don't get me wrong here. North Dakota has charm in its own right. So why is it supposed to take place in North Dakota? It's to tie it to the mean old oil company that doesn't care at all about the environment, as the Dakota Access Pipeline has been making headlines.This is where I feel duped by the preview. Had I known that the entire plot was an agenda driven environmentalists dream come true, I would not have spent the money at the theater. I actually went back and watched the preview online again thinking I had missed something. This is not the case. They actually avoided spilling the beans that this was agenda driven. Hollywood knows that that would have hurt the number of people who would go see this film.This could have been something truly epic, however I cannot recommend going to see this film, or supporting it in any other way monetarily. Remember ET, Back to the Future, Ghostbusters?? Remember how in ET the big bad developer was trying to bully Elliot's parents into selling their property so they could build a Wal-Mart?! Remember in Back to the Future where Doc and Marty are fighting the oil company that's trying to take over Hill Valley, so Doc builds a time machine to go back in time to ""set things right""? What about Ghostbusters, where those three scientists discover that the ghouls and goblins are going to poison the public by running fast food restaurants hocking trans-fats, so the environmental protection agency steps in and gives the Ghostbusters all the funding needed to fight this evil power?The above would have surely ensured flops, because people are sick of the agenda driven crap. Monster Trucks could have been so much more. It makes me sad.Hollywood needs to get a clue."
" Monster Truck cute and cheesy but just decent.
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"Monster Trucks is a cheesy, cute, and yet ridiculous of a family film about a Mediterranean creature that can hide and control a truck. And consumes oil. The idea and concept is beyond ridiculous but I am sure kids will enjoy it. And adults will either find the movie cute or stupid. It is no E.T. but does try for that formula with a high school teen Tripp (Lucas Till) that is desperate to move away far from home. Dislikes his mother new boyfriend and a Sheriff Rick (Barry Pepper). Tripp works in a junkyard at night until he finds a slimy tentacle creature that loves to consume oil and can maneuver his way around a truck. After an accident, when a corporation that was drilling for oil discovers an underground pocket that unleashed this creature. Reece (Rob Lowe) in charge of this oil company sends his security to hunt the creature down. Tripp and his classmate Meredith (Jane Levy) are on a chase to get away from the bad guys and to help the creature escape them. I will say the film is cute, to see a friendly creature that Tripp tries to help. From the moments of him trying to customize his truck for it to fit in and so he can have full control of the truck with Tripp and Meredith being the passengers in a crazy ride. Especially, when they are being in a car chase with henchmen Burke (Holt McCallany) and his team. Being in a car chase in a small town can be ridiculous with the creature able to have the truck leap onto walls and rooftops. Director Chris Wedge made this chase seem like he was playing around with toy trucks and using his imagination on some ridiculous action scenes. It is a family film that tries to be all heart and cheesy fun for the kids. Otherwise, if you are looking into serious acting and well written script. Well you can cross that out with this film not aiming for that direction. The acting was decent. Lucas Till performance was forgettable and Jane Levy was okay as an awkward teen. Amy Ryan as Tripp's mother was almost forgotten with her small role. Rob Lowe was difficult to take seriously. Barry Pepper as an obsessed with his car Sheriff was entertaining. The visual effects were decent as well, and moments were you could point out when characters were standing or hanging above a green screen. Director Chris Wedge has done some previous work like animation films like Epic and Ice Age. He can create some cute characters that can win the audience. He tries here with the creature that is cute and all but it does not make it a worthy film. Or a memorable one. Like I said before, kids will have a better enjoyment out of this one and parents will have a split opinion. Monster Trucks is a fair family film that has a redundant plot, cute concept, and dull acting."
" It's a good movie for kids and nothing more
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,5,"I feel like this movie was made for kids, as stated in the summary. The story told in the film has been told before in better ways, the only difference in this one is that strange creatures act as the inside of trucks. Once you reach the end of the third quarter of the film, the story will feel familiar to those who have watched a certain early 80s film with the same plot formula. I've also noticed quite a few movie clichÃ©s that help make the plot seem predictable. Most of the jokes fell flat on their face, but thankfully, there weren't many. The concept of the monster helping to drive the truck felt campy, however, I can't dislike this movie, nor can I like it. On the plus side, I still thought it was executed pretty well and the scenes which the creature helps guide the truck can be pretty creative. Overall, I think that the movie can be enjoyed thoroughly by kids and not anyone above that demographic."
" Fun, adventurous, quirky comedy. Perfect for the whole family
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,"This is the fun, adventuresome comedy that is perfect for the whole family. In this stupendous movie, there is a fun story line, quirky characters and terrific graphics. The way they incorporate each and every person's unique talents and personality traits is incredible. On top of that, there is an adorable comedic monster that is not scary but cute, silly and goodhearted. This movie is about a teenager named Tripp (Lucas Till) and his tutor Meredith (Jane Levy). One day, Tripp finds a remarkable creature that has never been heard of before. He decides to keep the creature and names him Creech. Tripp makes a huge truck where he can keep Creech inside and use Creech as the engine. He then has to get Creech back home with the help of Meredith. The oil people, which only loves money, want him dead. If people find out about him they will want to study him and protect him. This would cause the company to shut down. My favorite scene is when Creech Meredith and Tripp are hiding and doing a speed chase with the evil people who want to take Creech away from them to experiment on him. I love this because Creech is climbing walls, jumping on top of buildings and driving on top of the roofs. The graphics in this scene are spectacular and had me staring in awe at how well are executed. The characters have some hilarious jokes that had me laughing until my stomach hurt. My favorite characters are Creech and Meredith. I love him because he is funny, adorable, sweet and silly. I usually do not like creepy squids but this one is adorable. He provides comic relief that will have you smiling and laughing all the way. Meredith is the smart, quirky kind one who just wants to do what's right and help everyone that she can. Tripp is also very humorous and goodhearted and I love that about him. He brings the film to life and has you cheering for him throughout the movie. I recommend this to kids ages 7 to 18. Kids will love the characters that they can relate to, the adorable monster Creech and the story. Adults will love the graphics and the well written jokes. It is perfect for the whole family as a silly, feel good movie. I give this 5 out of 5 Monster Truck Stars.Reviewed by Morgan B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

" Super fun!
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"""Monster Trucks"" is one of those movies where you may not start out having much expectation about it but boy it proves you wrong. It's just a good old fashioned super fun action adventure that the entire family can enjoy. The concept may be a bit quirky, I admit, but if the kids laugh and they smile and their parents giggle, I think it's fair to say that ""Monster Trucks"" does exactly what it's supposed to do.Directed by the guy who gave us ""Ice Age,"" ""Robots,"" and ""Epic,"" ""Monster Trucks"" is about a high school senior named Tripp (Lucas Till) who builds his own truck from bits and pieces of scrapped cars. A nearby oil-drilling site's accident causes subterranean creatures to surface, two get caught by the greedy corporation while one escapes to the junkyard where Tripp works. Tripp encounters the new friend, names him Creech and turns out, Creech has the need for speed.I think ""Monster Trucks"" is the most exciting and hilarious feel-good family movie since Disney's ""Alexander And The Terrible, No Good, Very Bad Day,"" a few years ago. In fact I think those two are quite alike in a lot of ways. Sure ""Alexander"" didn't have the melding cutting edge VFX and state of the art CGI that ""Monster Trucks"" has but in terms of the humor and tone, both movies aim to entertain and bring up good topics for the younger viewers.Granted, it always cracks me up whenever I see people in their late 20s playing high-schoolers, such is the case with Lucas Till and Jane Levy with their respective characters, but that's not anything new in this business, and the actual star here is really the creature Creech who drinks oil and loves to ride fast. The car chases are also surprisingly inventive for a family movie, they're no ""French Connection"" or ""Ronin"" obviously but they certainly capitalize on Creech's abilities to make Tripp's truck do the impossible. The movie even frequently plays with heights which gives you that roller coaster thrill. All in all, ""Monster Trucks"" is an excellent way to start this new year for your family at the movies.-- Rama's Screen --"
" Great film to watch with your sons.
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"Watched Monster trucks today with my five year old son and we both loved it. He was pretty much glued to the screen the entire time and he got a bit teary at the end! The film centres on a lad who spends all his spare time building a truck at a junkyard he helps out around, three undiscovered squid like creatures escape from a nearby oil drilling project. One of these finds his way into the truck and ends up powering it and of course the usual bad guys want it back story line evolves. Nothing new in terms of originality or plot, in fact it had so many plot holes it was ridiculous but it's a kids film. Actors did a good job and the monsters were likable. Quite a lot of action and humour too, it's never dull. Definitely a boys/male film I think in my opinion. a kind of a cross between ""the legend of the waterhorse"", ""ET"" and ""Herbie"" Recommended."
" Great Family film
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"Starts off by giving little information about some of the core characters. Slowly building up to the first meeting with ""creech"".My Kids absolutely loved it, they don't care about CGI, does it look like another, or how hammy some of the acting may be. They wanted to see an fun, entertaining film, and they certainly got that!In some ways the creature reminded me of ""Toothless"" from How to Train a Dragon, but that would be down to it being a child.Overall, the plot was great for a family movie, few minor plot holes, but the kids didn't notice that (nor should they tbh)Overall, I took the kids knowing what the film was about and what to expect, and it was delivered."
" Good fun.
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,A young loner discovers a monster in a junkyard and finds he can use it to power his car. Soon he befriends the monster and sets out to help it find it's way home.Great special effects and some good performances from some likable lead actors makes this an enjoyable movie to watch. Don't expect the plot to hold up to well under strict scrutiny but it is a kids film after all. There are some good positive messages about family and friends with a little bit of a green message too but nothing heavy handed.The monster is very likable and the film has some funny moments too. Definitely recommended. I know I would have loved this as a kid and would have certainly enjoyed the action scenes in the second half of the movie. I can imagine younger kids of today having fond memories of this movie in the future. I just hope people give the movie a chance.
" The worst
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,2,"Absolutely awful, the pacing, the acting, the effects, the story, the character, the editing, the writing. Out of any film i have ever seen, this was the absolute worse thing i've ever seen in a cinema. it feels like a kid friendly sy-fy channel movie like sharknado but with morals like: friends are good, oil drilling is bad, blowing stuff up is awesome. This has already been written as a 115 million tax write off and that just shows not even the studio had faith in this atrocity. The film is pure and simply: trash. and i absolutely loved it. its literally kid friendly sharktopus, don't take your kids to see it, see it on your own with a big bucket of popcorn, vodka, and as many friends as you can gather for the best bad movie of all time"
" Great fun for kids
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"I took my youngest child, six years old (nearly seven), to see this yesterday. He bounced around like Tigger the whole way through, and only paused to turn around once in a while to tell me ""This is the best movie ever!"" This coming from a boy who loves everything from Harry Potter, Star Wars, Top Gear (and Grand Tour), to Tractor Ted and Octonauts.As an adult, it was a perfectly acceptable way to spend a couple of hours enjoying the company of my child. There's not a lot to the story, so if you've seen the trailer you won't be surprised. The monsters straddle the line well between being ""monstrous"" and cute (my boy acted suitably scared until it became clear that the monsters were on the good side, after which he loved them).He came out of the cinema asking when it would be available on DVD, so on balance a glowing recommendation from a 6 year old and a warm fuzzy one from me."
