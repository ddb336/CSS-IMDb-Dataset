" Z for Zachariah
",2021-04-12 00:00:00,6,"Margot Robbie lives alone in an isolated safe area following some form of epic destruction killing the population of the planet. She finds she is not alone when she comes across a weak Chiwetel Ejiofor. Using his engineering skills they start to build a life together and affection grows but this is put to the test when a third traveller - Chris Pine arrives.Very gentle, believable love triangle tale set against a background of rebuilding lives in a post apocalyptic environment. There are no zombies etc, just a quiet interplay between the 3 and an interesting look at the physical and emotional challenges this world would bring. All three give good performances, especially Robbie, although I rather wished Pine had articulated a bit more."
" Don't trust a potential enemy
",2021-04-12 00:00:00,9,"That's the main message. Don't trust your enemy, even a potential one. Anyways, John is more suitable for Ann.Good movie."
" Slow but worth it.
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,10,Not my overall style (so I thought) but I was mesmerized for the entire 2 hours.1.
" Nothing to do with sci-fi or thriller
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,2,"4 stars only
Actors played well and this is why I give 4 stars. Story was very lame and the situation was never explained. Completely wrong description of the movie. Very disappointed."
" Simply useless. Actually not science fiction at all.
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,4,"This is just ""Survival Island"" (2005 movie) with no sex, no eroticism and more pollution.
Seriously, if you are about to watch this because of the ""sci-fi"" tag, then JUST DON'T.
The film is good under a technical perspective: acting, pacing, and all the rest.
But here is the plot (no spoilers): two survivors (a man and a woman) meet, then a second good-looking man appears.
You already know where this is going. But at least you'd expect some thrill, right? Well, there is none."
" A Powerful, Understated Gem
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,8,"I watched this film about 4 years ago. The three actors in the movie all give excellent performances, but I'd have to select Chiwetel Ejiofor as my standout performer. I loved the pacing, the tone and the soundtrack. Some have said it was slow and boring, and I can obviously see their point, but if you were lucky enough, as I was to get immersed in this film from the beginning, the pace of the film really enhances your enjoyment. It allows you to appreciate in the subtlety. You are allowed to feel the depth of the situation in which they find themselves."
" Misleading
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,1,Awful awful awful. Didn't make any sense and ending was terrible
" Ok
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,5,"But nothing special.
Without the great cast it would have been boring for the most part of it."
" I didn't read the book, and it showed
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,3,"If it weren't for the talents of the cast, the beautiful New Zealand scenery and my outright curiosity I'd have turned this film off at the 30 minute mark. The assumption that the audience is fully aware of the back story is frustrating throughout as major moments go unexplained. Add the curious case of the disappearing dog and you've got a movie which poses more questions than it answered."
" Intelligent Survival Thriller
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,9,"A fantastic cast and a beautiful setting make this post apocalyptic thriller worth watching, but the depth of the story and the theme of science versus religion elevate it even further. The themes and story play out through a complicated love triangle, with jealousy, race and religion playing key roles in the plot development. Excellent performances by the three actors make it a very compelling watch."
" Good movie with only 3 characters?
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,5,"Pardon me, 5 if you include the dog and a turkey!
1st there's the girl, within first 5 minutes, Mr. 2012 shows up... some stuff happens, other stuff happens... then halfway through (thankfully) Capt. Kirk shows up! SHEW!! At least we now have some good eye-candy. But, even he couldn't save this snooze-fest!
Capt. Kirk isn't around enough for me, personally!
The ending is FLAT and boring (as is the rest of movie was)....PS - IN WHAT WORLD would a woman find Mr. 2012 more interesting and/or attractive than Capt. Kirk? Pllllllease!"
" Wiw
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,10,Great movie. Based on a book of the same name that is z for zachariah
" This is a very good movie
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,9,"Its a very interesting story... You really get close to human nature when s.i. hits the fan.
If there is one woman left, there is only room for one man.
There is also a few funny moments, but mostly its a drama."
" Beautiful survival movie
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,8,"This movie sets you into the context where you got to be working out the things from scratch for your daily existence, and it shows you the importance of life. Life that needs to be simply lived for the life. Breath taking picturesque spots just locks you into the shell with the beautiful nature that really convinces you that it is a really secluded world, and the only part of the world that exist after the apocalypse.The climax was ambiguous, adding a little bitter to the whole taste, which makes it even more tastier.
A perfect non-thriller but still frightening to imagine how every single day would pass by.Great work with the basics of science here and there."
" Amazing
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,10,"Not only is this a very well done movie, fantastic acting and very well directed film, but this is the first time I have ever seen my name in a public forum! It's pretty amazing due to the fact it's a wonder mind bending bending movie that makes everyone think about the idea of an apocalypse! Thank you Margot, Chiwetel, and Chris for an amazing eye opening movie!"
" ZZZZZ as in SNORING
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,6,"People trying to survive is challenging and fraught with problems and few soultions and unless ones finds an edge in an end of the world movie well you come to the end of your world i.e. your life. Here the players find a niche and what do they do? Revert to petty human nature deficiencies that instead of adding to their welfare and questionable future seem to take-away from it. What surfaces is the problem is really mankind. You see the message we get here is that even though you have a chance to start-over unless you change what doesn't work it is bound to repeat itself. Pretending it is not there only gives it a free hand to come back. The movie demonstrates the point. End of the world movies capture the imagination because it triggers our ancient survival DNA. As always, the first issue is food and water followed by safety and security. Then, the unknowns creep in and you have a standard movie line. You can add Zombies, Aliens, crazy people and cannibals but their issues are the same. Here they employ two men and one woman and if that is not enough add a racial dynamic to it. My take is I would like to see more of the struggle to survive, inventive and creative problem and solution and some sort of plan for the future instead of just surviving or boy gets girl or what is the point? There is no right or wrong here. Any story you can concoct will do but it won't garner a ten! Thus a six is upon you. Some parts drag and the pristine environment challenges the Radiation threat...Snacks wont help only patience to endure"
" Why why why
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,5,"I watched this movie back in 2015 when it came out. Thought it was a great movie then. Rewatched it again in 2019 and it's a ""good"" movie. I can't get over John's behavior the entire film. If I was Ann I would have shot him in that water. The yelling the violence the out burst and the ""I'm the smartest man in the room"" attitude is nauseating. Caleb should have lived John should have died end of story. That violent and dismissive attitude is not needed in an apocalyptic world."
" Beautifully shot with incredible performances
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,7,"This is gorgeous movie with stellar performances. However, if you've read the book you will be confused by the way it was adapted to film. The story as it's presented leaves the viewer on edge waiting for a clear and satisfying conflict and resolution. The movie is a slow burn that never erupts in flames and left me, the viewer, filling in the blanks of the characters motivations. It's unfortunate, as it's acted so well, but you're still left feeling the characters are one dimensional. They story feels incomplete. Still it is worth a watch and has inspired me to re read the book, to satisfy the itch that movie doesn't scratch."
" Crock of it
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,1,I had to study the book in high school and hated it then. How they managed to make a film worse than the book I don't know. How the hell is loomis black? Seriously I would have shot both of them. Milo is as always the star.
" Nice film
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,10,Nice film. It left an unanswered question though. Did Chris Pine die or not?
" my notes
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,3,"This movie is terrible and made me angry. it had potential and a lot of good things going for it. it was well directed with beautiful shots. it was well acted and had good tone-setting music. i was enjoying it for more than half the movie. and then it turned into a straight relationship drama with a love triangle. so many scenes were so intentionally awkward. i was so disappointed that that was the direction it took. this is a generally well made movie, but was a waste of time IMO. did i mention how boring it was? three characters, all talking, nothing happens. gg (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
and to top it off, it didn't have a conclusion. it just ended without telling us what happened. not open ended, just prematurely ended to piss us off even more than we were. if the movie focused more on men becoming baser animals and killing each other to get to be with the girl, that would have been more enjoyable. it was just about cheating drama for girls who love ""the wrong."" also, everything i liked about the ann's character went out the window when she decides to sleep with caleb the same night that loomis tells her he loves her. again, probably just written that way to feel more wrong. so stupid."
" Outstanding!
",2019-06-08 00:00:00,10,"This was a rare find focused more on character development and story telling than on action. I loved the premise and would like to read the book, although there are comments that it diverges significantly from the text. The acting was superb and made this worthwhile. The cinematography is worth the watch as well. I was impressed with the director's ability to make me feel the palpable loneliness of the characters and their desire to connect. This is such a human need that is well portrayed on screen during this film. Kudos for a job well done!"
" Interesting but underwhelming overall
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,5,"The first half of Z for Zachariah is intriguing and well played. Margot Robbie plays her sole-survivor exceptionally well and indeed keeps this up for the majority of the movie.
The setting is tranquil and yet disturbing as you'd expect for the central ""vanity"" of the piece and there is a grounding in these early scenes that is quite believable.
Alas, this is not maintained in the second half. The arrival of another stranger with a weaker backstory leads to a household tension that just doesn't ring true and yet dominates all other aspects of the story. Ending is nearly, oh so nearly, a redemption but just falls short.So close but also so far."
" Major Changes from Book
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,3,"Original book was a two-person story. In rewriting it for the screen, a third character was added. Obviously, the screenwriters had used the 1959 movie ""The World, the Flesh, and the Devil"" staring Harry Belafonte, Inger Stevens, and Mel Ferrer as a basis. If you have scene that movie, you can almost guess what will happen with a white girl, black male, and third act addition of another white male in a sexual triangle.John Loomis character changed from bad guy  to mostly good guy. Much more emphasis on religion undertones.And it leaves unresolved whether the Caleb character actually left after the falling incident at the waterfall (it was the Ann character who left in the book using the safe suit) or if John killed him to get Ann.Original book was more of a teen book. Movie is mostly boring with long silences."
" An intellectual movie
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,8,If you like a movie to tell the complete story without you having to think then this may not be the movie for you. The pace of the movie is slow however it is meaningful to show the development of the character's relationship. I read some make disapproval comments about the character that happened to be black. Those comments seemed unwarranted as we don't live in a one race society and I thought the movie did a good job overall in focusing on the personality differences of the two men.
" Blah
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,2,"One of the most eye rolling and pretentious piece of celluloid I've seen. Give me a break. It's not even effective enough to be emotional manipulative. I just hate when a filmmaker or any artist creates something that they assume everyone who sees this will know, ""this means something ....this is important"". Jeez.....People have written, ""Oh what potential it could have had."" Or ""what a great idea wasted . "". Those are just the negative reviews and I disagree with them. There was no idea in this flick to be wasted. Watch the very flawed movie, US . At that is a movie with ideas and you can intelligently critique one way or another. Or just go back and rewatch GET OUT & A QUITE PLACE ....at least you won't be wasting your time with, with .....What was the name of that movie I was talking about. I've already forgotten."
" Watch with open mind and look what the movie is trying to say
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,10,"I would recommend it, but if you are looking for a pure Sci fi movie then stay away.. It totally hangs on human side and nothing much about how the world ended etc.Now there are three characters and the very basic human needs are showcased. A lady who wants to have a family accepts a treatment no lady would in normal circumstances. A man whose life is saved by the lady never says thanks.. Mistreats her in subtle ways and interferes in every decision as if it's his house and land and only after there is another candidate for the lady he thinks of treating her better.
Only if the lady had stood up and said what she wants clearly I guess ending would have been different.
It tells you people how people behave when no one is watching there is no God.."
" Truly enjoyed the film
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,8,"I see a lot of people giving this film a very low score, but I enjoyed it. I felt that there was so much meaning in every scene and the acting was really great. I felt the feelings in the words and the facial changes were amazing. A good film that I would recommend"
" Boring derivative post-apocalyptic tosh without anything post apocalyptic in it!
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,1,"There are a glut of these type of movies on the market at the moment and all of them are equally boring, tedious and without a story as this one is - Stir in the usual BLM Hollywood agenda for no apparent reason and makes the movie even more annoying - Take your pick!I do not know what the director was doing as this was nothing at all like the book - You may ask what is the Z for Zachariah in the title, i believe as she was religious Adam was the first so Z for Zaccariah has to be the last man on earth.
In the book he tries to rape her and he shoots her and eventually she leaves in the radition suit to get away from him and moves to the irradiated city to die and nothing of what is in the book apart from him killing Chris Pines character was in the movie so in effect its a totally different story and so fails miserably!"
" Apocalypse Meh
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,2,"Let me start with the good: Cast, location, and acting. Meh: Story, premise, conclusion. Great actors turning in as solid a performance as the material allowed them. A post apocalypse flick, though it never bothers to flesh out any of the details as to why, and how. A nuclear tragedy is all that we know. Three survivors, two men, and one woman. The two men are Black, and White, respectively, which sets up a not very tense, undercurrent of racial conflict. Don't get me wrong- it's not overtly racial, except for one scene it's never mentioned, but that's the tone it's meant to evoke. I suppose it's meant to be clever, and provocative with this devise, but it falls flat. A shame since the cast, and acting was great, the location is gorgeous, but it all seemed wasted. This is a pretentious movie, and I assure you whomever wrote it considers themselves clever. It tries to be profound, and complex, but only comes across as annoyingly incomplete. If you're bored, give it a try."
" What happened to the Dog?
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,6,What happened to the Dog?1/2 way in-the dog who is a prime character - Ann's only support mechanism other than the churchThe dog disappears from the plotline and never shows up again - not laying on a rug by the fire strolling down the lane - nuth'nCaleb appears they take him home and the dog is never shown again
" Forced Post-Apocalyptic Love Triangle
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,3,"Setting and atmosphere of this film is interesting and holds your attention for a while. There is also A - list cast is attached to it which maybe another reason to watch.Story is very thin, there is no friction or spark between the characters.Margot Robbie's part needed a serious rewrite and maybe with a strong female character suited better. She was so obedient to everything around her, that it was miracle how she survived that long in that world.Stalker homage scene including Margot Robbie was forced and has no value other than referencing a superior movie in same genre."
" Meh...
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,2,"Visually gorgeous but the storyline, I found it was just not there for me to be intrigued by. It would've made myself watch the film even more. Regardless of the good cast they picked out, it just didn't work for me...."
" Why does he look mad all the time?
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,1,"I think Ejiofor is still pissed off from being kept as a slave for 12 years. He looks mad all the time and stares at the leading lady for minutes on end. No girl would stand this kinda creepy behavior let alone nurse him back to health and start a relationship.I don't know where Ejiofor learned his acting, perhaps he saw too many Omar Sheriff movies. He thinks staring long and hard at people with such ferocity and he looks at people as if they robbed his entire wealth and he came over to beat the crap out of you.If the lead actor has penchant for staring what was director doing? He should have intervened and told the actor ""Hey dude, nobody talks like that in real life. Cut it out. Act normal."""
" ""This man could be anything.""
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,7,"In that scene when Caleb (Chris Pine) and John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor) look into each other's eyes, with Caleb hanging precariously over the edge of the cliff, I felt pretty certain that Loomis would pull him to safety. In the subsequent scene, when Loomis tells Ann (Margot Robbie) that Caleb departed for Anson, I was convinced that Loomis released his grip and allowed Caleb to fall to his death. The perfectly ambiguous nature of the ending reminded me a lot of the way ""Angels With Dirty Faces"" ended, in which you had to decide as the viewer whether Cagney's character went out like a yellow rat or at the request of Father Jerry. I imagine most viewers for this film would take the position that Loomis's jealousy over Caleb's appearance caused him to seek the latter outcome I mentioned, but the alternative at least has a degree of credibility if you want to stretch for it. However the shattered, silent gaze between Ann and John to close out the story is probably all you need to know to confirm the more violent outcome.The mystery the film could have answered more definitively was what the heck the title was supposed to mean. In keeping with a recurring reference to Ann's religious upbringing, a child's Biblical book titled 'A is For Adam' is briefly shown, so one might consider 'Z for Zachariah' to bookend the picture's suggestion of the first and last man on Earth. It probably should have been done in a more coherent manner, as I was more perplexed by the title than what happened to Caleb."
" Interesting
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,7,"I really liked this film. I guess the movie was about racial struggles, and I guess that was interesting. I am a fan of Chris Pine, so I really liked his role in the film. Not really much I would like to explain about this movie. It's cold, it's sweet, it's cozy, and it gets a little tense.Watch it. You'll like it.7 stars"
" Ending could have been climactic, and not the bore.
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,8,The ending could have been such a climax with the excuse that Caleb left so obviously a lie. Our heroin could have sought revenge or at least confront or tried to get rid of him. At least her disfavor of him could have been a better ending. It's an insult to her to just live with a murderer especially given her religious demeanor. Good movie but meh ending that should have climaxed and not frazzle out.
" Two Hours of Nothing
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,3,Overlong with an expected ending. Boring and poorly scripted. Din't Expect too much to happen with an ending that had no payoff.
" Interesting take on a old idea.
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,8,"An outstanding cast. When I first heard of this film it reminded me of the 1959 Harry Belafonte classic ""The World, the Flesh and the Devil"". In a lot of ways this film mirrors that one but not entirely. 1960 The Last Woman on Earth is where the film then decided to go in the direction of. It kinda of leave a bit of confusion at the end that I didn't care for, but all in all I enjoyed it."
" A surprisingly great movie everyone should watch
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,9,"Only three people in the cast, but what a cast! Great performances all around, with restraint where it is needed, and no melodramatic BS. Margot Robbie pulls off an amazing performance, and Chiwetel Ejiofor shows what a great actor he is. He manages to pull you in and stand in his shoes. Chris Pine also does a good job, though he is the star who burns the least bright in all these three (probably because he has gown accustomed to leave the brightness up to his baby blue eyes, but those don't convince me: for me, talent trumps epithelium any time).
A few words of recognition should also be written down for the editing and photography., which are yet another instance of a very good job by seasoned professionals whose work you have seen time and again in major movies.
The plot isn't in itself that much of a stretch of the imagination: in a somewhat post-apocalyptic world, an innocent young farmer woman has to deal with two unexpected guests who are mature alpha-men - one a black atheist scientist/engineer and the other a blue-collar worker, god fearing white southerner like herself.
But this movie is so well scripted, directed, acted, and edited that it leaves you enticed the whole time, up until the very end.
I had this movie in my library for 3 years and never watched until today. I was postponing watching it because most of the reviews I read pointed to a somewhat religious bias. There is no such thing whatsoever. You can be a christian or an atheist and enjoy this movie, plus it will give you a bit of pause to recheck your values (unless you are an a***ole who thinks you have all the answers).
To be honest, I'm inflating my rating a bit because I think this movie didn't get the rep and attention it deserves."
" Boring movie...
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,4,"This is just a bad movie, plain and simple.Why waste a paragraph on why it is so bad. Even the ending was bad and as we all know, you really have to work at having a terrible end."
" I COULD USE A GLASS OF WATER
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,6,"Ann Burden (Margot Robbie) and her dog have managed to survive the nuclear holocaust due to the topography of her land and using common sense in dealing with contamination. She meets up with John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who has a Geiger counter and a type A protective suit on steroids. He suggests making a generator using hydro-electric power from the water falls. However, in order to do this he would have to take apart the church her father/preacher build. If you happen to look at the DVD cover or movie poster then you know Chris Pine also shows up and the description say ""emotionally charged love triangle"" which is a not exactly a plot spoiler, but he does come late into the film. If there was some way to watch the film having never seen the poster, or knowing he shows up, that would be the way to do it. As for me, I kept waiting for him to show up which made the film go slow with anticipation. So if you are planning a showing, hide the DVD cover.The title comes from a kids book Ann has on the Bible. John opens the book and sees ""A is for Adam."" One would conclude what ""Z"" would be, as there is a hint and some talk that coating the world with radioactive contamination was part of the plan or at least Ann's survival. The book of Zachariah, talks about the rebuilding of Solomon's Temple as a juxtaposition to the discussing to tearing down the church. The survey of Chris Pine was correctly done as he assumed the industry standard position of Jesus on the cross.The acting was good and then there was Chris Pine. The film moved slow. For people who want to watch an end of the world film with some minor religious discussion, the notion God will save a few people for his plan, and no zombies then this is it. Please note, there is a latency period of ""puking"" and general sickness when one is exposed to radioactivity. The latency period depends on the amount of exposure from a week to immediately. If you are ""puking"" right away after exposure, you will die shorty. No medicine can save you.Guide: No f-bombs that I recall. No real nudity. Implied sex."
" Quick Review
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,1,"The whole movie sets up how perfect a match PIne and Robbie are. And then in the end she is stuck with the person that kills both her brother and Pine. One word, booooo."
" Another parable
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,1,I would have liked this had it had a happy ending.
" Boring slow nothing happens
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,1,"This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Almost literally nothing happens. No real passion, no real conflict, no real plot, no conclusion, no story. There is very very subtle jealousy, and I guess you could call it conflict as the new guy causes ""concern"" for the established man of the house and that is about it. Oh, they do build a water wheel together - that is literally about all that is accomplished in the entire movie. The only saving grace for me was it did make me sleepy before I went to bed. I could write a better movie than this with one of my frontal lobes tied behind my back. Complete waste of time."
" Remarkably acted and directed ugly preacy story
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,1,"How could anyone think it was a good idea to turn this piece of crap story into a movie is beyond my understanding. It was brilliantly acted and directed, no comment there. But the story!!!??? If you boil it down to a couple of sentences, the antagonist was a scientist, atheist and black. Everything the ""salt of the earth"" people fear and hate. Did anyone even consider this angle? Congratulations on making a fine racist, movie. You also managed to depict non-believers as immoral. And add a reason to dislike educated people. Wow!"
" A squandering of talent
",2018-04-06 00:00:00,3,"Z FOR ZACHARIAH is an entirely boring post-apocalyptic movie based on a famous sci-fi novel. It manages to waste the entire premise thanks to the rural setting and the decision to cut all of the interesting material from the book, leaving it flaccid and devoid of incident. The story involves three survivors in a cabin after some kind of worldwide devastation; they argue, bond, and fall in love, and inevitably jealousy tears them apart. This whole film feels small-scale and low-key, with uninteresting and unlikeable characters. It's a pity as both Chris Pine and Chiwetel Ejiofor have done fine work elsewhere so seeing them in this feels like they're squandering their talents."
" Atmospheric, thought-provoking, but the ending is weak, weak weak.
",2018-04-03 00:00:00,8,"A beautiful young woman (Survivor #1) lives alone in a magical valley that has survived a nuclear holocaust. She is a domestic goddess, as well as being hot.A research scientist (Survivor #2) stumbles into the valley and she nurses him back to health after he dives in a radioactive pool. Love begins to blossom, but he resists it, saying it will change everything, and they must take their time. He also confesses that he may have shot her little brother who was dying of radiation. Her passion is not killed by this, however.Another survivor (#3)- who is hotter than Survivor #2 (well it is Chris Pine) - oh, and not black either, like #2 - turns up, and helps him build a water wheel to provide electricity for the woman's refrigerator so she can survive the next winter. They have to break down the small chapel her father built. She is pleased about the fridge.In the meantime she and Survivor man #3 cannot resist having sex. Survivor #2 says it's ok, in spite of his love. We're set up for fireworks.Up to now, ZfZ has been pretty good; maybe a little slow, but so was Manon Des Sources, of which this is a little reminiscent.SPOILER HERE: The ending is that Survivor #2 kills Survivor #3, and tells #1 that #3 just walked off. #1 and #2 resume their life together, awkwardly.WHAT? If she had just fallen down a hole so that Survivor #2's murder of Survivor #3 had been futile, it would have been satisfying. Or she had developed radiation poisoning. Or become pregnant. Or anything. Instead, Nothing. What a let-down. But an enjoyable ride."
" What happened?
",2018-04-03 00:00:00,7,"I remember choosing the book when I was at school for O'level exams 47 years ago and it was obviously written to be suitable for young teenagers. The story in the film didn't relate to the book. I wanted to relive my enjoyment of it but was disappointed. Having said that, I did enjoy the film,the acting and story, but it wasn't Z for Zachariah."
" weird ending
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,6,"So some things that stuck out here. The humans survived a holocaust. we see a woman and her dog living in a church.she has on a hazmat suit, but why did it come off? were there only certain areas where there was airr quality to allow that?
so, she goes out hunting with an air rifle and finds a lame camper in the middle of the road....and a crazy diabetic in a space suit. They bond almost instantaneously.
Chemiki Okafor becomes excited and bossy at the same time, remember when shes on the tractor, and hes like get off the tractor come hang out with me, and she was like, no thats okay im gonna do what i want to...
then he got drunk at a local supermarket and could identify which snacks and sodas she liked and didnt like by what was surplus in the store? very creative.
At that point, he became a lil abusive....but they ended up getting sexual anyways.
So, then they find chris pine....oh boy....and some weird love triangle happens.It was cool...cuz chimeki okafor was like its cool to like him, we arent married....and the conniving spirit visible in chris pines character was all like, well instead of taking ownership of this chick and making me feel like it might be time to move on...it was BOOM i got your girlfriend.(see that scene where the next morning after they had sex in the bathroom chris pine all drapes his hand on her hair and sits down next to her eating breakfast?)
but she gets remorseful and proclaims her love and commitment to the black character...weird.
so this dude, chemiki okafor can make electricity if they build a wheel to get water to generate it...margot robbie is all like, how are we gonna pay chris pine to do hard labor and work with chimiki? and of course, chimiki takes on the stance well im the boss and he should work for free if hes gonna be apart of our circle..
whatever....so the ending happens...its a lil spooky because chris pine left once the project was done and the electricity got turned on.DID HE LEAVE? or did he get killed? then we are left with...um black dudes a killer and can be abusive when he drinks...maybe...is she gonna get raped for the rest of her life? or is this gonna be a gratifying experience for the both of them etrnally with a missing person...being chris pine...OH yeah and i forgot chimiki tell margot robbie that he in fact killed her brother, and what does she do....gets the sniffles and says its okay..its okay?
so this chick is mentally ill. but so is the diabetic....obviously."
" stripped down
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,7,"Preacher's daughter Ann Burden (Margot Robbie) survives a nuclear apocalypse alone with her dog. Her family had left to search for other survivors. She scavenges supplies from the nearby abandoned town. One day, she encounters John Loomis (Chiwetel Ejiofor). He gets sick from contaminated water and she nurses him back to health. There is tension especially with her religious beliefs but they grow closer. Then, another stranger named Caleb (Chris Pine) appears out of nowhere.Robbie is the it girl right now although her role would be played more effective by a more mousy, quiet actor. She needs to be a plain tomboy and possibly rougher. She doesn't seem to be doing any specific accent which leaves the location unknown. The stripped down plot is effective. It's a slow start and needs a better way to pull in the audience. It should follow Loomis at the start as he escapes the devastation. That would be compelling although it may be beyond the no-budget production. Once the triangle is formed at midway, the movie picks up a little steam. It's an apocalyptic movie not for the usual fans."
" Doomsday à trois
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,5,"Even if this movie is seen as an allegory, or a modern Bible story, it is hard to accept a post-apocalyptic landscape in which no horror or tragedy is ever shown. Instead, nuclear apocalypse is a plot device used to isolate three characters in a love triangle-- a rather extreme device.A young woman (Margot Robbie in a fine performance) lives on a farm in a secluded valley that somehow escaped the nuclear holocaust. She is joined by two men who managed to survive because they were both underground when it happened. The first to arrive is John (Chiwetel Ejiofor), an engineer wearing complex hazmat gear. Later on, Caleb (Chris Pine) arrives, though he skulks around stealing eggs before he's discovered. For all they know, they are the last three people on Earth, people whose survival is very much in question. Their secluded farm, like the Garden of Eden, is an illogical phenomenon that only makes sense as fiction. That's fine, as long as there's a reason to dispense with rationality in the interests of a message, or at least entertainment. I'm not sure that ""Z for Zachariah"" manages that, because it is diverting but enigmatic, and ultimately unsatisfying. Themes of religion and rebuilding are introduced, but not explored. Alcohol is introduced a few times, only to confuse motivations of characters we barely understand in the first place. The movie is careless about all the characters, in fact-- especially the fourth one, a dog named Faro. He is the girl's constant companion on the farm at first. Then the men arrive, the plot begins, and the movie drops the dog without a word of explanation. (Perhaps Caleb ate him? Hot dog and eggs?)It is classified as sci-fi on IMDb and other places, but use of the word ""radioactive"" doesn't qualify a movie as science fiction, and I saw nothing else that looked like science, unless you count an engineer building a water-wheel. Really, it's a chick flick that's set in a minimally-realized future. It's not an ordinary chick flick, in that there is no girl talk, but the movie's subject is not survival or the future, it's human emotions under stress-- love, loneliness, jealousy.If you agree that emotions are what will matter most to the last three people on earth after a nuclear holocaust, then this movie may be for you.NB: I haven't read the book, which I gather is superior to the film. But a movie has to stand on its own merits, so the original source material is ultimately irrelevant. As Tom Wolfe said when asked about the film version of Bonfire of the Vanities, ""I retained the right to cash the check."""
" soo baad
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,2,"This movie is very bad. At the beginning I was hooked because I was curious what will those characters do alone and what will happen at the end. Although it was common topic (some kind of apocalypse) I was still curious. Characters looked good and were played by the great actors. But after some time I was really bored. Nothing happened. And then I thought it will be interesting after the 3rd character comes so I waited. But no. After he came, nothing changed. It was still boring. There were no action whatsoever. It wasn't even relationship between characters. Nothing. At the end I was really disappointed. Do not watch this movie unless you like to waster your time. I gave it 2 out of 10 only because of good actors."
" Terrible ending
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,6,"I won't say,""the book is better than the movie,"" because I read the book only after watching this movie. I will say that the movie tells a completely different story than the book, borrowing Robert C. O'Brien's characters and setting.The ending as given in the movie suggests that John Loomis killed Caleb, by pushing him down into the radioactive water and sacrificing the safe suit. Otherwise, why would Caleb leave without saying goodbye to Ann and without taking his things and supplies? I like the suggestion from a fellow reviewer that the scene at 1:26 showing Ann rolling a glass off the table and leaning on a book suggests that she imagined the whole thing because she's bored. Lack of dialogue in the final scenes supports this suggestion.The John Loomis character in the book is a control freak and a killer who tries to rape Ann and Ann hates him. At the end, she outsmarts him and steals his safe suit to leave the valley. This is the act of a smart and strong girl who decides to explore the unknown, leaving behind her possibly the only other human living on earth. But just because he's the only other man around doesn't mean that she has to live with him or mate with him. This is the diametric opposite of the Ann character shown in the movie, who is a wishy-washy girl caught between two men. Please. The men who made this movie should remember that the Ann character was created by a male writer, Robert C. O'Brien. They should also consider what kind of message they're sending to women by distorting her character in this way.Good things about this movie: the beauty of New Zealand and Chris Pine's eyes. But I can watch the beauty of New Zealand in ""The Lord of the Rings"" and Chris Pine in other films.The movie also serves as PR for Robert C. O'Brien's book, which is a good thing. I also read his ""Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH"" as a child after watching the animated film version and picked it up again after reading this one. Reading it as an adult, I wonder where O'Brien's preoccupation with disaster came from."
" There's Trouble in Paradise...Three's a Crowd in Post-Apocalyptic Love Triangle
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,7,"A Post Apocalyptic Mood Piece. A Little Film with Little on its Mind about Exactly What Determined the Fate of the World that Left Planet Earth with a Radioactive Patina. Well, not All of Earth.There seems to be a Garden Patch in a Valley that is ""Immune"" or somehow ""Blessed"" with Protection. A Rebuilding ""Starting Over"" Place, just in case, Humanity is Worth Saving.The Science vs Religion Debate, or ""Point of View"", is Immediately Front and Center as Margot Robbie Plays a Young Adult that was Raised as a Preacher's Daughter (and it took) that Plays the Church Organ and Defends ""God's House"" and ""God's Way"" with a Soft Spoken Spellbinding Character and Performance.Chiwetel Ejiofor is also Soft Spoken but His Words and Deeds are more Earthy and based on Scientific Training and Education. He is Obviously more ""Worldly"" than the Rural Virgin Girl, but the Two Work Well Together and make for a Productive and Healthy Couple.Enter Chris Pine, also a Young Adult who Exudes Manly Charms that Robbie's Ann Finds Irresistible. That's the Sci-Fi making that Giant Sucking Sound as it is Replaced with Soap.Overall, the Movie is Well Acted from the Trio and it Looks Great. Based on a Popular Teen Book from the Early 1970's by Robert C. O'Brian but ""Liberties"" have been Taken.It's a Slow Burn, Talky Affair with an Ambiguous Ending and a Calm, Subtle Approach to a Devastating Development that Reduced Earth's Population to Near Extinction.Recommended for those that can Appreciate its Laid-Back Tone and Rather Shallow Sermonizing about Life, Love, Spirit, and Survival."
" You Can Still Love in Apocalypse
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"In my modest opinion it is an underrated movie. Of course it has it's mistake but still had shown us some good things. you will go through the interesting life of three characters who have fallen in love triangle which was pretty exciting and interesting for me and this was introduced by many great ways.To start with the soundtrack which was great and made us blend with the events. Then we cannot deny the great performance by both Margot Robbie who proved to me that she is a great actress and Chiwetel Ejiofor who is one of my favorite actors, Chris Pine wasn't bad but he wasn't as good as them. The Maestro of this piece is Craig Zobel who has shown to us his own personality in his work and he has a respectable view who I totally loved.You live 90 minutes of love struggling which ended in the best way it could by showing us that love is always the same whatever the world is."
" Is this a joke?
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,2,"Yes it is. A bad one.Someone in some hazmat type suits goes to a public library to grab some books in some devastated place. Then goes back home where she lives with her dog. It's the lovely Margot Robbie. Some other day while looking for any animal that may have fallen into her trap, the dog runs away and when she follows it finds some guy in some other ridiculous protective suit and a cart testing the area with a Geiger counter. When he takes a shower at the waterfall she approaches him an warns him that the water is polluted. He wants to shoot her of course but eventually runs out and asks her to inject him. He needs daily injections.She takes him home. He's an engineer. He's black--very important for Hollywood. They get the tractor working again to make farming easier. Seeing the waterfall he comes up with the idea to use it to generate electricity. She's got some broken generator. But he needs wood and looking at the chapel she's got (she's a preacher's daughter--there must be millions of those apparently because movies set in the country can't do without them). But of course she's reluctant because it was the chapel where her dad preached. The girl wants to become intimate with the guy but he refuses.Some other day she runs into another guy stealing her eggs. He was a miner when whatever happened happened and is on his way to the south. She and Loomis agree to let him stay the night. He ends up staying longer, helps wherever he can since he's much more fit than Loomis. He's attracted to the girl, she to him. But Loomis thinks he owns her somehow. And she thinks so too. Still she can't resist temptation.Thanks the the new guy, the girl agrees to build the powerplant with the church's wood. While Loomis and new guy are up on the waterfall finishing things up, something happens, it's not clear what. A few minutes later the movie ends without saying anything. It's not much of an ending because in this movie nothing gets started to begin with.This movie is an endless drag, little goes on, little is said. Near the end I had enough and started fast-forwarding. No, this movie isn't even about relationships, as the characters have little to say to each other, avoid the important topics and barely speak. It's certainly not a sci-fi post apocalyptic movie either, after all, somehow where she lives there is no radiation, so she can live like a normal farmer would. This movie is about nothing at all.Is it based on a Christian book? That would perhaps explain the enthusiastic reviews. The new guy utters some meaningful lines about religion but there's very little religious here, nothing that would warrant a 10 rating. Performances are standard, nothing to go crazy about, it's not like the roles are very demanding. I haven't read the book and even if the book is great, the movie is just lousy.The only thing this pointless movie has going for it is the lovely Margot as a brunette playing the role of a sweet, innocent, religious country girl. It's a pleasure to see her.Unfortunately we don't learn here what the budget for the movie was. It couldn't have been a whole lot. But the end credits show that they got a lot of incentives from a lot of places they didn't even film in. These state bureaucrats may want to be more careful how they distribute tax-payer money."
