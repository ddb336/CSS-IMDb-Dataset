" No sign of Darryl Hannah anywhere!?
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,3,"While the film was beautifully filmed and very well directed with great performances by the four main actors, I can't say that the story itself was really worth telling.It was long and drawn out and not just a little bit boring in places.Ralph is outstanding as the most brilliantly annoying man ever and Tilda, in a fabulous wardrobe throughout, is superb as a mute rock singer, a very clever idea as it gave at least some interest and a quirk to distinguish it from other similar films. Matthias Schoenaerts is just incredibly sexy, the type of guy you want to meet on holiday and fall in love with.I've seen a similar film called Wasp (2015) which appeals to me slightly more, but the acting in this is far superior to that one.It's an ok film, but I'd only watch it again for Matthias' naked body."
" talent pool
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,7,"Predictable join the dots tale, brightened by two stars dominating proceedings. They are a pretty insufferable bunch. The film makes its hedonistic protagonists seem like characters in a classical tragedy. The intimacy between them becomes more oppressive and results in ever more extreme behaviour."
" One scene can save a film
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,6,"It is good sometimes to have a mini-retrospective of certain film directors. Put off by the coy, almost closeted feeling of sexuality in ' Call Me By Your Name ' I decided to see more of Luca Guadagnino's films. Amused slightly by Tilda Swinton working with him twice I watched ' I Am Love ' ( a disaster on almost every level ) and then with definite trepidation took on ' A Bigger Splash ' with its very loud hints of the Hockney film and painting, and distant memories of ' La Piscine '. For the first hour of it and some I was not splashed at all, but amazed at yet again the trivia of lazy rich people doing strictly nothing to add to the world in any way. Swinton looked good and acted mainly with her facial gestures and not with her voice ( silenced by too much very bad singing ) and Ralph Fiennes giving a deafening performance of high Camp; sound and fury signifying nothing. Only Matthias Schoeneaert ( I am not checking the spelling ) was quiet both in body and expression and looking a bit bored with it all. He probably wasn't but I hoped he was. Then things took an Operatic plunge to music from Verdi's ' Falstaff ' Act 3 in the swimming pool which had previously given endless boredom to this viewer. And the scene was actually not only good, but strikingly good lashing out with suppressed homoerotic savagery and visual strength. I was amazed at seeing at last a truly well structured scene and bowled over by it I raised my 2 rating to 6. The last part of this long, long cinematic experience also had its good moments with a fine ending. Guadagnino's film gave yet again another good finale and perhaps that is what he does best. I came away from this self imposed retrospective with the impression that eventually ( perhaps ) he would make a truly original film from a truly original scenario and wow us all. But I do recommend he cuts out on superficial characters and vulgar scenes of luxury food and rich parasites with servants. He will no doubt not read this and I fear my hopes will be dashed on the rocks of yet again a bad Operatic film. Maybe he should listen to Berg's ' Wozzeck ' and have a St. Paul Damascus moment and realise that the poor are richer than the rich. This is unlikely as all good things are, but I live in hope."
" good plot ! dakota johnson is just bearable as always
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,7,"Guadagnino's take on the portrayal of the privileged. Interesting and exciting plotline, with occasional cringeful acting. Eccentric characters and lustful mood. Swinton and Fiennes steal the stage while Dakota and Matthias fight hard to shine. Some interesting cinematography - a few dramatic shots, while at times becoming exhausting. Music goes both ways too - confusing sometimes, with moments of perfection."
" Good but ""La Piscine"" it's not
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,8,"As the French movie ""La Piscine"" (""The Swimming Pool"") is a firm favourite of mine I started on ""A bigger Splash"" with high hopes, the title being borrowed from a David Hockney painting. And let me say it is an intruiging movie with solid acting (although Fiennes' character is very annoying - but his Rolling Stones scene is great!), beautiful vistas (I even had a flashback to Antonioni's ""Profession Reporter"" in one or two scenes - always a good thing) and good music score. But it misses some of the subtlety the gorgeous Romy Schneider and her co-lead Alain Delon gave the original version. The movie should have benefited from more editing in length and could easily have been 15-20 minutes shorter and gain momentum. And why is Fiennes' Harry Hawkes complaining about ""that horrible island"", yet knows all the fancy restaurants, cheese makers and festivals? An even higher rating is lost because of the silly ending."
" Again another remake
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,7,"This time of the French 1969's La Piscine with Alain Delon.
Are the filmmakers out of books or inspiration ?"
" A Total waste of 2 hours
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,3,"A sketchy and fragmented storyline, warning of 'nudity and sex'?.............REALLY? I guess thats all they could think off to sell the movie to cinema goers. Very poor script and overall quality. We sat here waiting for this movie to 'get going'.....it never does. Truly disappointed and amazed that such talented actors as Fiennes and Swinton agreed to be in this garbage astounds me. To make this boring flic 2 hours long is 60 minutes too long........for the same amount of time I would rather watch Tom Hanks on a desert island talking to a volleyball and turning into Robinson Crusoe, far more entertaining.
NO RECOMMENDED - AVOID at all costs. 3/10"
" Dont waste your 2 hours on this garbage !!!
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,1,"OMG what a crap ! Director should learn first how to utilize good actor/actress !! 2 prominent actor (Matthias Schoenaerts,Ralph Fiennes ) and one actress (Tilda Swinton ) shouldwasted their good will for this crap movie . Specially Tilda Swinton, didnt you see your acting on post production ??? poor editing, poor background music and specially very poor directorship ."
" It probably has a lot to give if you look closely.
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,6,"A strangely hypnotic and disquieting movie that creates a feather-light sense of dread a long time before anything particularly negative happens.I suspect the characters are very nuanced but it was a but lost on me. They're certainly pretty charismatic and you can kind of lose yourself in its steady rhythms like a lava lamp, with its casual glimpses into lost humans or just for the way it seems to be some kind of holiday wish fulfilment.The thing didn't make a particular coherent whole for me but I'm happy to acknowledge it was a bit over my head. It's a slow and breezy burn in the Mediterranean sun where rich people very gradually lose their cool.I feel that what SHOULD have been the climax of the movie was not the seen as such by the writers and they kept going for another 20ish minutes in a way that adds nothing."
" What the hell did i just watch?
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,3,"I don't get the point of this movie.
It's aggressively boring, slow, makes zero sense.. Even the characters were annoying as hell!!
What a joke"
" Magnificent Movie i ever seen
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,10,This is a great movie and nice drama in it. I like it and I watch it 2 times. This movie is worth to see.
" Incredible and unpredictable drama
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,9,"A Bigger Splash is an incredible and unpredictable drama that's beautifully filmed, well paced and bold. Matthias Schoenaerts, Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes and Dakota Johnson all give incredible performances. The music is fantastic and Luca Guadagnino's direction is incredible. However, the ending feels a little abrupt."
" Who cares when the splash comes?
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,6,"In Luca Guadagnino's film 'A Bigger Splash', a rock star and her husband are visited by a former lover and his teenage daughter. A drama of sexual jealousy plays out around a swimming pool. The fact that, in terms of intimate contact, nothing actually happens is beside the point in an atmosphere without trust, with the two men butting heads and the daughter enjoying her own sexual power, in part in rebellion against her father. But the story of this uneasy foresome didn't quite work for me: Tilda Swinton doesn't convince as a rock star, even once you make allowances for the fact that she is protecting her voice and therefore never speaks above a whisper. And none of the other characters are likeable - indeed, if they had redeeming personal qualities, the drama would be absent from the situation. The story actually makes sense; it's just a little hard to care."
" Could not get past the first minute of the movie.
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,1,"The first scene is an ugly drunk ""rock star"" spitting while walking crooked. Then walking onto stage gloating to a full croud as if they're a monument of perfection and deserve everything.The second scene is two people sunbathing with angry faces, then angry sloppy drunk kissing and sex in the pool. The viewer is approx one meter away portraying staring at them in wonder and awe.The third scene is them driving in a car sitting like robot zombies or good boys/girls...A depressed egomaniacs dream film."
" Quality and style - a ""see""!
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,9,"This being my first acquaintance with director Guadagino I was very happily surprised. Halfway through the movie (yes, watching from the couch) I had to pause and do some online research to get my pre-conceptions about him confirmed. The film is trully enthralling, capturing and good looking. You almost want to savor and save it as to have some quality content left in your uncosumed store.Apart from the main characters (where all four actors excel), a major part is done by the island Pantelleria itself as well as the meticoluosly crafted surroundings and the outfits the carachters are permeated in. And this is in no superficial way either. The futuristic sunglasses worn by Swinton, at one occasion borrowed by Schoenarts, contrast with a clear meaning against Johnson's white plastic frames which gives us some references to Lolita and what we might expect later in the film.The serpent enters the garden of Eden - in the shape of Fiennes and a veritable water snake. From here on it is a drama where things will be uncomfortable for the viewer. Things will just probably not go well. But it is very well carried out.The only negative remarks would be the plot twist and the difficulties in maintaining the movie's energy as we need to deal with policemen, occasional sirens (used in the same way as the occasional cat in a horror movie) and crime instead of the characters continued and uninterrupted interaction.However, wanted to add this as I was surprised to see so lukewarm comments on this site for something I see as one of the best movies I have seen the last 12 months, and certainly something with a distinct feeling of originality compared to most of what is available in main stream media applications. It is definitely a ""see""!"
" oh no.
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,3,"Even it was a bit boring though i found the story line pretty interesting, and the actors' performances were absolutely great even that doesn't mean that i feel happy about the characters they played.( i have to say i hated harry and his daughter, strange and stupid friends... they were just ugh) .
one thing that i cannot approve of ...was how the director moves the camera feels so old i thought i was watching a colourful 1930's movie or something.
personal taste it is and i realized i wont bother to watch the movie of this director again....huge fan of Matthias, thanks to him i watched this if not, no. haha..."
" This could be a really good movie... but it just isn't
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,2,"Rating 2 out of 10 is just because of beautiful scenery, otherwise it will be 1.Movie is so boring, with so many unrelated dialogues, I can even say stupid dialogues, annoying characters, some people and scenes falling here from some another movie I guess, because I didn't see any point here.Ralph Fiennes performed fantastic, but his character is so annoying that you couldn't even notice his brilliance. Dakota Johnson should give up acting, that's just not her thing.I was deceived by the rating of this movie, but I guess you should be some kind of artist to, not understand, but pretend that you understand and like this movie so you can somehow convince yourself that you are special and cool like this director (not)."
" What?
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,1,Nothing happens in this movie please SAVE YOURSELVES IT SUCKS AND THERE IS NO POINT TILL THE END. Literally it's a movie about nothingness.
" This does not bode well for Suspiria
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,6,"I have seen this before but was keen to remind myself how it measured up to Jacques Deray's 1969 original with Alain Delon and Rome Schneider, particularly bearing in mind this is directed by Luca Guadarnino whose remake of Suspiria is about to open. At first the heady mix of characters, run rough shod over by Ralph Fiennes, is interesting and although nobody seems likeable, to be forced to be in this company has some potency - bit like being on a group holiday with people you don't like but are going to have to get along with. Its all okay but Fiennes over the top performance grates more and more and with Tilda Swinton playing the most unlikeliest of characters (and without use of her voice!) things begin to become more than a little waring. On top of this the thing goes on far too long and with a ham fisted attempt to make the ongoing immigrant crisis relevant the cause is lost. This does not bode well for Suspiria."
" What
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,4,"For a film to truly succeed in my eyes, it needs acting to be good, directing to be good and a story to be good. And I gotta say, the directing was great. The acting however bored the hell out of me and there wasn't a story until the last half an hour. Also, what's with all the nudity? I get that they are lustful or just quite eccentric but there is so much nudity from all cast members that you realise there is no story and just nudity from good actors and actresses. For direction, it's great. Everything else is tedious"
" What did I watch?
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,3,"This is the second Luca Guadagnino film I've watched, the first being Call Me By Your Name. I've come to the conclusion that Guadagnino is highly pretentious. Watching both of these films I get the impression that when he was making them his thought process was ""I'm going to make a cerebral, artsy movie"" rather than letting greatness come naturally. I'm a fan of Tilda Swinton, but her performance here was awful. I understand the circumstances before she took on the role, but if she didn't feel up to it, she shouldn't have taken it. Matthias Schoenaerts and Ralph Fiennes are the stars of the movie, and both of their performances are exceptional, especially the former's. Dakota Johnson was just being Dakota Johnson the whole time.The film had a lot of potential, but it never quite fulfilled that potential. Reading about all the changes that were made to the story make me think that if those changes hadn't been made, it would've been a much better film. Pacing, I think, is an issue for Guadagnino. Certain ideas are introduced but not elaborated on, while others that are not that important or relevant to the story get stretched out. If the running time were cut by 20-30 minutes, it would probably be a better, more efficient telling of the almost non-existent story."
" Enjoyable for scenery, one liners, & the feeling of being on Sicily
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,9,"Cinematography and filming location won my heart and kept my interest. Felt like spending a relaxing summer vacation there. One liners such as ""All of Europe is a graveyard"", ""I fall in love with every pretty thing"" Fiennes drowning scene quote "" We're all disgusting, but we love each other anyway"" stuck with me for some reason. Lackluster ending. I rated this higher as the film stuck with me and I found it different from many other stamped out films."
" Under the Tuscan Sun - it is NOT!
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,6,"On the surface this seems to be a thriller-like movie in the bright sunlight of Italy. Still, it won't work if you watch the movie like this. The film was made when the European refugee situation turned serious. And all the characters in their self-centered ways seem so far away from the real world. Once Rock rebels but now just concerned with their private problems - it's no coincidence that the star has lost his voice, her lover has to fight an alcohol problem and the Hawkes character is simply appalling. To offer some explanation to the police they are willing to throw some nameless refugees under the bus. Still, I have to agree to some of the negative reviews. The film is very long and very slow and obviously the protagonists are quite negative (which is the point of the film). I can't see much of character development which is mentioned in some reviews. These characters CANNOT develop anymore. They are stuck in their ways, which probably also the reason why the girl is crying at the end of the film.
It is not a coincidence that the setting is Lampedusa, where many refugee boats arrived. But is this really helpful to hide the message when this topic is so big and important? 
As a classic ""thriller"", the movie is obviously not working (imagine what a veteran Hollywood director of the 1930s would have done with the plot! William Wellman or William Dieterle would have told the story in 10 minutes). So if you appreciate a subtle, indirect way of storytelling this might be a movie for you and as some positive reviews show, the movie works for many people."
" It's not for everyone, but it's for me.
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,10,"Randomly found this movie and I got hooked. Beautiful casts. Intriguing. Real.
Beautiful location. Dreamy.
Beautiful fashion sense.
Love this kind of movie.If you're a fan of blockbusters or festival films - you might find this movie boring. It's not amusing nor profound at all.Just a movie, beautifully done."
" Finally Dakota Johnson is a sexy film that's actually good
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,7,"'A Bigger Splash' may not have a great amount of depth to it, but it's still a thoroughly entertaining piece of soapy drama with a knockout performance by Ralph Fiennes. After viewing previous films by Italian director Luca Guadagnino, I was prepared to watch the film that was visually stunning but also quite slow-moving. While the former certainly met my expectations, with beautiful direction, cinematography, scenery and costume design, I was quite wrong about the latter. The pacing in this film certainly picks up, compared to Guadagnino's previous works, making this film a little easier to remain attentive to. A film doesn't need a fast pace to be good, but it certainly does help. There are obviously exceptions to that rule. Telling the story of four different characters, all with conflicting and interesting quirks, who are holidaying on an island in Pantelleria and the drama that ensues, which is wildly entertaining, mainly due to the brilliant performances. Normally, I'd rave on about Tilda Swinton and how she's my favorite actress and that she was brilliant etc... etc... (did I just do exactly that?) but it was undoubtedly Ralph Fiennes acting that stole the film. Taking charge of every scene he's in, Fiennes brings his bombastic and loud character to life and is certainly the highlight of the film. Dakota Johnson and Matthias Schoenaerts also do very well in their roles, but it's certainly Fiennes that is the frontman. Despite the film being engaging and pleasurable, it never reaches greatness. The third act of the film falls flat and essentially becomes a bore, which lets the film down. The climax is rather anticlimactic and feels like something was missing. Unfortunately, this leaves the film feeling rather average once the credits roll. Alas, the film is saved from being poor with its visual appeal, brilliant acting, and screenplay and masterful direction by Luca Guadagnino."
" Dissapointing
",2018-05-26 00:00:00,1,I watched a Bigger Splash for an hour before I gave up. I realised I didn't care about any of the characters apart from the Italian maid. I've worked on films like this all the enjoyment was in the making.
" A Mostly Miss
",2018-04-09 00:00:00,4,"The cast is great, story however is weak and opaque. With so many better movies to choose from, this one should seldom, if ever, be watched. Great landscapes,
nice cinematography, good acting; just no story. There are a lot of stories within this plot the writer could have explored, so many possible dialogue possibilities. Instead there is nothing...unless you make something up in your mind...in which case you have another reason to not watch."
" I tried hard to like this...
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,5,"But I couldn't. It was... depressing? Boring, negative... what was the point of it? To show that people are people and people suck? Probably. Dakota's character was... erm... repulsive? What were her motives at all? All that being said, Ralph Fiennes was amazing, he did a really good job - his performance as well as cinematography were the only things worth watching this for. And I'm not sure if his character was supposed to be the ""worst"" among them, but to me they were all equally terrible. A pointless story really. Too many ""why-s"" and too many ""no-s"" ..."
" Fiennes at his Fiennest
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,8,"I hadn't seen A Bigger Splash but after being dazzled by Call Me By Your Name, I rushed to find and see this Luca Guadagnino 2015 film and it confirmed without a doubt that Luca Guadagnino is a remarkable filmmaker with a retro eye and a futuristic sensibility. His elegance makes cinematic the most unpalatable of tales and this one, a four sided triangle, it's unpalatable and scrumptious all at the same time. Tilda Swinton is superb as the voiceless singer, Dakota Johnson gave me, for the first time, a glimpse into what she could be, Matthias Schoenaerts hits all the right notes even the most unexpected ones but Ralph Fiennes gives a performance that it hast to be seen to be believed mostly because this is the same actor in Schindler's List, Quiz Show, In Bruges and last year he provided me woth one of the funniest scenes of the year in Hail Caesar. So, as you must gather, I had a great time and I'll wait for the next Guadagnino with childish anticipation"
" A Bigger Splash
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,6,"I saw the trailer for this movie at the cinemas and thought it looked interesting, and then I accidentally sponsored it to be added to the movie trivia app Popcorn Trivia, alongside my intended title Splash (1984), so I was definitely going to watch it. Basically in Italy, in an isolated villa, on the small volcanic island of Pantelleria, world famous rock star Marianne Lane (Tilda Swinton) is recovering from a recent surgery, and is staying quiet to protect her singing voice, only communicating with hand signals and occasional whispers. She is on holiday with her filmmaker lover Paul De Smedt (Matthias Schoenaerts), he is also recovering, from his alcohol addiction and a failed suicide attempt, neither he or Marianna speak Italian, both need the solitude. Their peace is disturbed by the arrival of an aeroplane from Rome, bringing with it a man neither of them want to see, extroverted music promoter and record producer Harry Hawkes (Ralph Fiennes), also Marianne's former lover, and Paul's former protégé. Accomapnying Harry is his previously unknown daughter Penelope ""Pen"" Lannier (Fifty Shades of Grey's Dakota Johnson), they quickly move into the villa, inviting friends as if it was his home, and taking everybody out to various sights and festivities. Harry's arrogant manner and A-bomb blast of delirious nostalgia bores Pen and annoys pen, it seems there can be no rescue, but Marianne cannot help but fall under his spell again, and the two make love, while the unhappy Paul easily succumbs to the sultry Pen who makes her play. Harry returns to the villa one night after a night of heavy drinking, he skinny dips in the pool, Paul and him eventually get into an aggressive fight, it ends when Harry is drowned, the maid finds his corpse the next morning and calls the police, Marianna is traumatised and screaming risks her voice being damaged. The police have urgent business with illegal immigrants landing from North Africa, some found floating and dead, but they take the occupants of the villa in for questioning. Marianna convinces them that she was asleep at the time of the murder, and the killer was an intruder, while Paul lies and says he went to bed before the time of Harry's death, he is believed. Pen reveals that she can speak perfect Italian, but she decided to allow her hosts to struggle, also she is in fact 17, not 22, Marianne takes her to the airport, and for being insolent gives a good slap before she leaves. Also starring Aurore Clément as Mireille, Lily McMenamy as Sylvie, Elena Bucci as Clara and Salvatore Gabriele as Mayor. The four leads all give great performances, but Fiennes absolutely steals the show, dominating every scene with his over-the- top eccentricity and dancing, the film uses the Italian locations to its advantage, presenting beautiful scenery, the use of colour is good, and what follows is a funny and interesting series of passionate exchanges and tensions between the characters, a most watchable drama. Good!"
" Dull film with dull screenplay
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,2,"This film has simple characters with many illogical reaction and motivation. The central plot was not bad but not extraordinary at all. Besides, there are many unnecessary camera motions, furthermore, the most of the flashbacks do not do anything with the story. It has a minor importance but has to be noticed, that the film does not have any idea about the Italian culture (pinata, Mr. Paul, etc.) - even though the director of the film is Italian! Overall, the 2-hour running time is too long by far."
" Pure torture. Even the location is unattractive.
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,1,"**Update** I have just updated my rating and dropped this horrible film from 5 stars to 1 star. I was forced to re-watch this wretched cringe-worthy movie as I was visiting a friend who desperately wanted to see it because he's a Tilda Swinton fan. I didn't have the heart to tell him how I felt about this film, and good thing, as he actually liked it. Go figure. It was absolutely dreadful the second time.**I really disliked this film. It's pretentious in every way. The characters, every single one of them, are highly unlikable. If you met them at a party you'd say, ""What assholes these people are!"" And with all the beautiful locations in Italy they chose this barren ugly piece of land on the island of Pantelleria, which I hope has more beautiful stretches than this. The reason they filmed here is likely because the filmmakers received some financial incentive. I don't think I've cringed this much in a film in a very long time. The only reason I'm giving it five stars is because I'd like to support independent filmmaking. What a quandary."
" An anti ,yet cinematic, Hollywood tale. Not for Hollywoodics
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,10,"Saw this movie at the film festival in 2016, really enjoyed it actually. Terrific cast, beautiful locations, interesting romantic story. The movie might be considered as a slow burner for the straight- to-the-point film lovers. It takes it's time to tell the story and give all the little details. Some websites labeled this movie as a thriller but it's far from that. It's actually a Dark realistic comedy drama, no action here folks. If you are fed up with Hollywood movies and want to try some new, different and more mature content, this would be a good start for you. Take your time to experience this film, see it with an open mind. A+"
" Slow burner but springs to life
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,6,"This film is a curious mix of banality and insight. The first third was the boring part, with characters who didn't spring to life, about whom I did not care and who were not very likable . They were shallow but thought they were important because one of the four main characters was a rock star. Then a much deeper exploration of their characters and motivation as well as the complex relationships between them came into focus and the story took off. They suddenly became real and their hopes and fears made them more human. I stuck with it although it took some doing and ultimately did care about their fate. It is beautifully filmed with a strong sense of place and worth a look."
" A movie that should never have been made- I am sure all the actors agree.
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,3,"A strangely uninteresting brew set in a beautiful, somewhat exotic, Mediterranean setting. Happens to be Italy but could have been set in France just as easily. What is the thing with middle aged Italian directors? Luca Guadagnino is born in 1971, but has the need to expose women in very compromising poses, and showing an abundance of flesh (be it female, male or that of a gutted fish!)in every shot possible. The movie is not sexy, not even remotely so. The story is very tepid. I don't care if it is a re-make of a previous movie. Surely there must be lot's and lot's of budding (and weathered) script writers out there who could come up with something better than this? All thru the first two hours I wait for the promised tension, the danger. Tilda Svinton is an amazing actress, but with a recent flair for picking really shitty scripts (yes, I am referring to the terrible Okja for one!) and Ralph Fiennes, surely he must get better offers, or did his role as Voldemort ruin that for him? The most bizarre scene in the movie is when father (Fiennes)and daughter (Dakota Johnson) sing a karaoke duet, all tangled up like lovers. Surely, only a lecherous man could come up with such a thing? Just avoid this movie. I wish I had. (Oh and another thing, if you have lost your voice, you should NEVER whisper, just a tiny bit of research could have sorted that annoying detail!)"
" Groovy rock'n'roll until it hits the wrong note
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,7,"An aging rockstar convalesces at a private home on a Greek Island with her sober lover... until the party arrives in the form of her ex-lover and his spoiled daughter. Lushness of behavior and scenery might be another cliché if not for the singer being almost mute; wonky hipster Swinton does a fine job despite having little to say, and fanatical carefree Fiennes gives a weighty performance that strikes a balance. Meanwhile, party guests come and go, most everyone gets naked in the sun, and a fridge full of wine and fresh seafood fuels ""neuvo-riche"" chatter as the Rolling Stones get a listen on vinyl. Yet despite its artful and intimate approach, this film sells its soul as it slow-dances toward an unlikely plot point that was maybe added at the last minute to appease conventional audiences. All about sex, drugs & rock'n'roll, this exotic vacation is worth taking only if you can forgive its lazy and proletarian denouement."
" It was needed?
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,3,"1251/5000 When I started watching this movie, a few minutes later I came to the head that I saw some time ago, The pool, as I moved forward I saw that it was a new version and the first thing I thought it was, because if the Old I did not like, telling me that the remakes are usually worse, to see how this is. I later corroborated the situation.The movie does not make any sense. The attempt to put several films in one, several genres in one, is very bad for the director. It accompanies a soundtrack that is even worse.It is slow in time but it is also long and also, so it was necessary to do it if it was already made and was not good.The truth is that Tilda's role is complicated, pretending not to be able to speak, does not have to be easy. But otherwise, it has great complexity.I have frozen the camera movements. How can you make such bad moves.Photography never succeeds. During the day it is too light and at night it is not seen. Apart from forcing you to wear sunglasses, it does not add anything else.The address, telling that he does not realize that he is bored, the mixture of genres, that the planes are ugly, that the temple is bad, there is nothing more to say.What a way to throw the money."
" Very subtle
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,6,"In ""A bigger splash"", the audience gets to know the story of a celebrity couple that has to face some long forgotten problems when an old friend and lover appears and brings along his mysterious daughter and ambitions to win back the lady.The movie has a well-known cast and convinces through beautiful images of the Italian landscape it plays in. It includes recent issues such as the refugee crisis and tries to base the story within its surroundings. Personally, I have to admit, that I didn't really find a connection to the plot, though. The film is a very slow one and nearly all of the characters remain distant in one form or another. You do get to feel the jealousy and tension the events are based on, nevertheless it didn't feel like there was a lot of tension building up and so in the end, you don't really know what to make of the film. I could imagine that all of this is well considered by the producers, it just didn't work out for me.All in all this is surely a well-produced movie that manages to hit the undertones of jealousy, seduction and long buried feelings. If you are d'accord with a slow plot and subtle tension, this is definitely worth a watch for you."
" Tilda Swinton Micast
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,3,"I thought this film was annoying, at best. It is also very pretentious. I believe this is owed to the director, who apparently is under the impression he has already won the DGA Lifetime Achievement Award. The worst part is the casting of Tilda Swinton as a rock star (???). She has the charm and appeal of cabbage plant. I can think of at least a half-dozen actresses who are better suited for the role.At first, I was thinking of Gwyneth Paltrow, who is very smart, sexy, beautiful and much more believable. However, I changed my mind, and began leaning towards someone with more of an edge; say Noomi Rapace (or maybe Mirielle Enos)."
" Disappointing from great potential cast
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,3,"I don't blame the actors. I don't blame the directing. Simply put, the story line stinks. I'm assuming that the only reason WB gave a green light was because this was tied to another project. Forced production. Attempting Indi art and respect. Notably, I'll give credit when credit is due. The actors are superb at playing the roles given. The cinematography is beautiful. Gorgeous and romantic. Bonus points for tapping into the libertarian open sexuality. Too bad the story was too ho-hum. Typical. Simple enough to easily assume outcomes, yet characters so unattached that the audience doesn't care. I've watched Hallmark movies that have been more investing in my time."
" What a load of rubbish!
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,1,"Complete load of rubbish, masquerading as an art(y) film. Four characters, only one of whom is remotely sane, three of whom are both uninteresting and unpleasant. Tilda Swinton is her usual pretentious self, only voiceless. Mathias Schonaerts is handsome and quiet (thank goodness). Ralph Fiennes doing manic is the most irritating and pointless character I can remember on screen. No-one half civilised would stand him for as much as minute. The nymphet does what you expect nymphets to do. I despair of professional critics who go weak at the knees if they can describe a film as arty. Thank goodness for so many sensible ordinary viewers who tell it like it is."
" Worshipping vs Love - the end of old and simultaneously the start of new rock'n'roll years.
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,8,"I loved it. I gave it an 8. Beautifully filmed, sensual laid back acting performances with an authentic feel for the laissez fair atmosphere on a holiday island in the Mediterranean. It reminded me at times of the 1969 movie La Piscine with Alain Delon and Romy Schneider. And of course the Lolita theme is in there. The young girl coming of age lying about her age, controlling the men around her with her sexuality. Like Tilda's Swinton character used to control Harry. Harry who is living on his past achievements and now merely is tolerated by the people he loved before. The young girl who is not a weak vulnerable girl but a girl who wants to be in control and who observes the adults around her. An Oedipus complex, Paul killing his 'brother' Harry, there is the Greek tragedy for you. Growing older, literally using a different voice as life prolongs. The end of a rock'n roll lifestyle (the record Emotional Rescue literally dies with Harry in the pool and his death literally becomes an emotional rescue for Harry, Marianne and Paul. The young Penelope on the other hand is just starting her emotional rock'n'roll years and flies to the rest of her life crying in her airplane seat).Harry worshiping Marianne, Harry loving his newly discovered daughter Penelope in an oedipal complex kind of relationship, the policeman who is a worshiping fan of Marianne, Paul loving Marianne in a true and honest way while he is lusting after 17 year old Penelope. The rich and famous and self-absorbed westerners enjoying a low brow holiday in between ordinary people. Getting privileges ordinary people would not get (a table in a full restaurant, a karaoke machine and a party in an empty cafe) And when necessary they won't think twice about blaming the strange foreign other, the African immigrants. Just as easily they will lie to save their own.It's a beautiful, well made sensual slow paced movie."
" Heavy rock without any roll.
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,1,"Nearly past it rock chick faces past lover, present lover and the most unrock chick floppy clothes on boring holiday with wet ending.Cliché piled upon cliché. Annoying self- awareness in every shot. Ralph Fiennes and Tilda Swinton are unbearably earnest in keeping the integrity of their characters, and you just know Swinton suggested she play with a voice problem. Probably to ""uphold the connection to Marianne's singing career, the heart of loss..."" Of course.Thank the Viking gods for Matthias Schoenaerts,as Paul the disconnected lover, whose beautiful face and body know how to act without effort.Casting adds even more pain - ethnic maid, bumbling Italian carabinieri, pitiful refugees. Even the crumbling town and high-perched house seem cast by numbers.My wish-list kept calling for what this film could have been - a truly moody and sexy film. Acting that's not acting. Sex scenes that are more than awkward knee-tremblers as bony Ralph Fiennes shucks his pants. Controlled and deep emotional power from the screen. Please? Anyone? No...? Sigh."
" I'm really not sure how I felt about the film as a whole!
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"'A BIGGER SPLASH': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A dark comedy-drama directed by Luca Guadagnino; who also helmed the outstanding 2009 Italian drama 'I AM LOVE'. The movie stars Tilda Swinton (who also starred in 'I AM LOVE'), Ralph Fiennes, Matthias Schoenaerts and Dakota Johnson. It was written by David Kajganich and Alain Page. The film tells the story of four friends spending vacation together, on a remote Italian island, when things go horribly wrong. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's been nominated for multiple prestigious awards (and it's even won a few of them). I found it to be somewhat interesting, but it's definitely nothing special. A popular rock star, named Marianne Lane (Swinton), and her filmmaker boyfriend Paul (Schoenaerts), are spending vacation together on the Italian island of Pantelleria. An old friend of theirs, named Harry (Fiennes), unexpectedly decides to visit them. He brings along his adult daughter, Penelope (Johnson), who he just met. Things become tense between all of them, and then things go drastically wrong as well.The movie is bizarre, and it does take a really dark turn in the third act. I'm really not sure how I felt about the film as a whole. None of the characters in it are very likable; Swinton's rock star is actually the closest thing to a character you can really root for. The performances are all decent in it though, and the movie is somewhat interesting (at the very least).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' review at: https://youtu.be/RO7ghqXHCCY"
" Why two snakes
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie is one of the best I ever saw. Only thing spoiling it a bit for me is the girl. I don't see why she is in the movie. Obviously it is an Adam and Eve theme and of course they are visited by a snake, the rock stars former lover. The teenage girl is apparently a second snake, or maybe Antichrist, since she is the daughter of the snake. She oozes jealousy and hatred, but still it is unclear to me, why she is in the plot. She doesn't add anything apart from literally writhing with evil, quite contrary to the real snakes coming visiting every day on the terrazzo. They are just writhing and completely harmless. Swinton makes an unforgettable impression even without talking. So does Fiennes as the manic producer and ex-lover. He is so annoying that you almost feel sorry for him. What a brilliant actor he is. I wonder a bit about time references. If he were 17 in the late seventies, he must be in his mid-fifties, which he is not."
" Why am I watching this?
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,1,"### some spoiler#### I am trying so hard to tolerate this, but is has been over half hour and it is difficult to look at the rock star, Marianne, as she is so beyond ugly and looks like the guys grandmother. Let alone the early sex scene in the pool was a turn off...oh, did I mention so boring? Only one fellow is doing all the talking, which he has nothing to say. Is there a zero to vote on? Dancing unoriginal like a drunk. OK, 37 minutes....off it goes. I can't even come up with 10 lines of text! How about trust me on this? Don't waste your time. I would rather sleep. Why does there have to be 10 lines of text? Is that really necessary?"
" intriguing actors
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,5,"Marianne Lane (Tilda Swinton) is a famous rock star. She is saving her voice while vacationing peacefully with filmmaker boyfriend Paul De Smedt (Matthias Schoenaerts) on a remote Italian island. They are surprised by the arrival of their annoying faded music-producer friend Harry Hawkes (Ralph Fiennes) and his recently discovered daughter Penelope Lannier (Dakota Johnson). Harry surprises them again by inviting over Sylvie and Mireille.Swinton and Fiennes are a couple top level actors. He is aggressively petty, jealous, and annoying. He is a great force of destruction. It would be nice to have a better exposition of the characters' relationships early on. It keeps one from truly investing in these characters. Marianne has a forced silence while Paul is a passive character. The movie reaches a pinnacle as the foursome is joined by Sylvie and Mireille. I was hoping for a manufactured isolation of those six characters in a spiraling sexual thriller. Instead, it goes in a sudsy soap direction. The actors are able to maintain interest but the meandering plot fails to be compelling."
" A Cinematic Belly Flop
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,3,"Three considerably talented actors (let's leave Dakota Johnson out of the conversation, shall we?) are wasted in this borderline terrible movie about four unhappy people whose problems I cared absolutely nothing about.Throughout the film, snippets of news reports about the Syrian refugee crisis are juxtaposed to this quartet's dull collection of first-world problems, and the refugee situation is even used overtly as a plot device late in the film, so maybe that's the point. Maybe we're supposed to be frustrated with how self-absorbed and insular these dreadful people are in context of the much more significant global happenings around them. But if that is the point, it wasn't well made, and it certainly wasn't one that needed more than two hours of screen time to make it.Ralph Fiennes is obnoxious and obnoxiously naked for most of the movie. Tilda Swinton isn't an especially unpleasant character, but she's certainly a fairly dull one, and she's not believable for a moment as a major glam-rock star. The most compelling character is played by Matthias Schoenaerts (his past alludes to addiction and attempted suicide), but true to the rest of the movie, any sharp edges he might have been able to bring to the film are dulled by the general torpor.I had given up caring about happened to any of these people by the half-way point, a sure sign that the movie I'm watching is a dud.Grade: D"
" Ralph Fiennes in a sexual tension shocker!
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"Strange film that I caught up with a few months after the cinema release that I missed. Remake of a sixties French film La piscine (The Swimming Pool) about a rock star, Marianne Lane played by Tilda Swinton relaxing on their Italian island Pantalleria with her current partner Paul who is rocked when her ex-partner of six years Harry Hawkes (Ralph Fiennes), a rather eccentric music producer arrives on the island with his apparently 22 year old daughter Penelope (Dakota Johnson). Quell a love rectangle as Hawkes and Lane rekindle old sexual interest and Penelope flirts and gets it on with Paul. It is strange seeing Shakespearian actor Fiennes playing such an eccentric role and even more disturbing to see him parambling around the swimming pool naked.The volcanic Sardinic island provides great scenery for the Director, Luca Guadagnino and Director of Photography. What follows over the next 2 hours is a simmering sexual tension as the two new/old couples are formed. What becomes even more of a shock is the outcome of poor Harry in the swimming pool and the real age of Penelope. Throughout the film Scottish actress Swinton cannot speak due to a recent operation that threatens her singing voice. The arrival of Harry and Penelope threatens the very existence shall I say of Marianne and Pauls relationship. A very rectangular relationship if such a thing exists?"
" Heavy symbolism almost buries the delicate psychological drama
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"Tilda Swinton can convey more with her mouth shut, her face half-hidden behind a pair of out-sized mirror shades, than many actors can with their entire vocal and expressive range on display. She's a tour-de-force here although Ralph Fiennes gets all the mentions because his character is continually exposing himself verbally, physically, emotionally.If you're expecting a sun-drenched frolic on an Italian island, don't watch this. There's sun in plenty but even the earliest frolics are overlaid by a surreal and claustrophobic silence that permeates all the film's future moments whether erotic, awkward, or enraged.The central character, a rock star, is recovering from a throat operation and forbidden to speak or sing for two weeks. Her ex-lover, a music producer, intrudes on her seemingly idyllic island retreat with his daughter and brashly turns the place upside down.Much is made of the sexual tension but that's only the top layer. Anyone watching for that alone will find this film predictable, even dull. The real psychological depth lies in all the issues beyond sex, which are subtly presented throughout. Issues of aging and loss, fear for the future and clinging to the illusion of stability. Of relationships tangled deeper than any kelp bed.There are layers of symbolism, visually, musically, and thematically. Some are bludgeons, others are mere whispers.The last moments left with a couple of questions that will keep the characters alive in my mind for a good while and bring them back hereafter when I see certain landscapes, architecture, or clothing.Enjoy the scenery, deplore the brashness and the duplicity, contemplate the clothing and the camera angles, and if you're not drawn in by the half-hour mark, it's not your kind of movie."
" Slow-moving love triangle saved by Ralph Fiennes portrait of aging, obnoxious record producer
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"A Bigger Splash is a remake of a 1969 French film, La Piscine. The plot is similar, featuring an aging record producer Harry (Ralph Fienees) involved in a love triangle with his former protégé, Marianne (Tilda Swinton), a rock singer and her current lover, Paul (Matthias Schoenaerts), a photographer. Also in the mix is Harry's 17 year old airhead daughter Penelope (Dakota Johnson), who later we discover is trying to pawn herself off as a 22 year old.The big star here is not the slow-moving narrative but the Mediterranean island of Pantelleria, a beautiful little lava-strewn hot spot frequented by hipsters of various nationalities. When Paul and Marianne (who's recovering from throat surgery and can only speak in a whisper) show up at the mini-paradise, they're immediately invited to stay over at Harry's villa which features a pool that figures prominently in the story later on.Keep in mind that Harry and Paul are good friends and after Harry broke up with Marianne, he encouraged Paul to hook up with his former lover. Now after six years, Harry is remorseful over the prior breakup and naturally makes a play for Marianne who doesn't really want to get involved with him again. Meanwhile (couldn't you guess?) Paul is off for a little hike with Penelope and it seems the sexual sparks are beginning to fly, especially after Penelope disrobes for a little sunbathing beneath the island cliffs.All of this sexual tension takes quite a bit of time to get going and one has to have great patience until the penultimate plot twist occurs involving Paul who strangles Harry in a fit of jealous rage in the aforementioned pool. In the original La Piscine, Paul (called Jean- Paul), confesses to Marianne that he killed Harry. Here Marianne sees the scratch marks on Paul's legs, but also fails to turn him in.What really saves A Bigger Splash from complete mediocrity is Ralph Fiennes' performance as the brash and obnoxious Harry, whose claim to fame is having worked with the Rolling Stones on a cut from their Voodoo Lounge album. The other principals are a bit flat—Swinton perhaps a little too intellectual for a part that calls for a more earthy Stevie Nicks-type; and Schoenaerts is way too laid back to make much of an impression at all. Johnson is better as the cold and indifferent teenager who seems quite unaffected by the death of her father.As a murder mystery, A Bigger Splash fails to pass muster. Paul gets away with it as the Italian investigating detective is too besotted with Marianne (asking for her autograph in the final scene) to suspect that there may be something much more sinister afoot with the apparent prime suspect.I'm tempted to call A Bigger Splash a ""film noir"" but most of the action takes place during daytime—thus such an appellation doesn't quite fit. If you have the patience to sit through the whole thing and you're a big fan of Ralph Fiennes, A Bigger Splash should be for you."
