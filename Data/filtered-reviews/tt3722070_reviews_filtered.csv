" Extremely boring and about as interesting as its title suggests
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,1,"A homeless woman parks in the driveway of a writer. And stays there for the next fifteen years. The writer presents the story to us and bickers with himself for the entire duration, interluded with snapshots of an old and vulnerable woman living in her own filth in an awful state in his front garden. Does anything happen? No. Do we find out about the lady in the van's background and past and what led her here? Yes. But do we care enough? I certainly didn't. I haven't been as bored or nauseated by a film in a long time. It's one of the worst films of the decade."
" Alan Bennett fans won't be disappointed
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,7,More of a Maggie Smith fan but this makes me want to watch a few more of Alan Bennett's play's.
" Squatter's rights indeed!
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,8,"When I saw the trailer of this movie, I instantaneously took a liking to it. I liked the concept & of course, Maggie Smith was the cherry on the cake! The film didn't disappoint and was everything that I expected it to be. It is a polite reminder of how prejudiced we can be towards the less fortunate people, especially those suspected of not having their mental faculties in place. As 'civilized' people, we are uncomfortable and subconsciously afraid of such people; sometimes even crossing a road so as not have to walk beside them! This movie makes us ask ourselves what it is that we are really so afraid of!The movie introduces us to the unlikely relationship that develops between a reluctant landlord and an unsociable old squatter who parks her van in his driveway. Apparently, the reluctant 'landlord' finds himself unable to care for his own aging mother and probably it is his guilt and his timidity (or perhaps a literary curiosity about the squatter?) that drives him into helping the squatter out, much to the amazement of the entire neighborhood. After all, who in their right mind would allow a filthy, rude (and actually stinking) old lady to live in their driveway? But whatever his motivations, the landlord, who happens to be a great writer, does allow her to stay on and they end up cohabiting like that for 15 years! Slowly, the landlord comes to realize that the old lady has an interesting back story. The viewer then realizes the deeply human frailties that are masked behind the filthy & rude veneer of the old lady. The movie has some light moments also which work very well and the entire cast has turned in very fine performances. However, the ending scene didn't work all that well for me. It was a bit too fantastical!As appreciative as I am of people like the landlord who helped the old lady out, I would much rather help my own mother first. That is not to say that I'm judging Mr. Bennett in any way, but perhaps I'm not as compassionate towards other folks as I am towards my own kin. Let's hope I get a little better with age!Lastly, the thing that I love about this movie is that like a good book, it made me look within & introspect. If such movies are right up your alley, then don't miss it!"
" Weird, Slow and Boring
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,4,"I guess you have to be British to enjoy this or to put it mildly...""not my cup of tea"". Yes Maggie Smith gives a good performance of a homeless person, but everything else is just such a slow slog and the writer character...as well as pretty much everybody else are just so weird, dull and stupid."
" I hated it
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,1,British films are all the same. They start off funny and interesting but then quickly become disturbing and miserable. Gave up falfway through when it became repetitive with no obvious plot. And whats with the being rated a 12a when there's the f word being constantly used?
" A tale of begrudged kindness
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,7,"In spite of his self-proclaimed shyness, Alan Bennett has always been a rather public sort of intellectual; meaning that, unless it's all been a rather sophisticated act, one can say with some certainty that there's an autobigraphical inspiration behind many of his works. Nonetheless, usually he writes fictional stories, whatever their insipiration; but when he wrote 'The Lady in the Van', he addressed his own life more explicitly, including his life explicilty as a writer. In writing the screenplay for this filmed version, he cleverly duplicates himself, appearing simultaneously as writer and character. Although he doesn't look like Bennett, Alex Jennings gets his tone spot on; while Maggie Smith, a longtime Bennett collaborator, is excellent as the old woman who parked her van on his drive and stayed for fifteen years because he couldn't quite bring himself to send her away. It feels if her's should be a hammy role, but Smith's Mrs. Shepherd is both irritating and human because, while certainly vigorous, she doesn't overplay. It's not Bennett's greatest work perhaps; as a true story, there's not exactly much plot, but director Nicholas Hynter (someone else with a long history of productive collaboration with the writer) brings it nicely to the screen."
" A Mostly True Story
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,8,"Maggie Smith shows the same courageous lack of vanity that Bette Davis did in 'What Ever Happened to Lady Jane?' in really letting herself go in this fey little anecdote set in the days when you didn't need to be a foreign billionaire to be able to afford to occupy an entire house in Camden. (Victor Buono's character from the earlier film is effectively reincarnated as two squabbling Alan Bennetts.)The fact that she stinks is remarked upon throughout, but we viewers are spared that; unlike George Fenton's aggressively whimsical score, which never tires of prodding us in the ribs and reminding us how wonderful this all is."
" Started watching by accident, gripped to the end
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,8,"Simple, endearing and heart warming. Not something I'd planned to watch or ever would, yet still I watched to the very end.
Both the lead actors held my attention to my and the story, so bizarre as to make the phrase ""reality is stranger than fiction"" hold true. Two lives, two stories thrown together and then entwined. Simply a pleasure to watch"
" Dreadful
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,1,"This is supposedly based on a real occurrence. If so it speaks volumes about Bennet and his somewhat twisted view of life. In the film Maggie Smith (bloodhound eyes and nausea inducing stare) might portray a real person, but along with the improbability that such a vehicle as hers would be allowed on the roads all suggests that there's a lot of 'over-egging' of the plot.Anyway, I just found it all quite implausible and overdone. I watched most of the film but found it tiresome in the extreme - there's a 'Groundhog Day' feeling about it . . like ""will this bad dream never end?"""
" rather charming
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,8,I quite enjoyed this. The acting of course was excellent. The story was very interesting and excellently delivered. The writing was clever. This was a difficult movie to make as it is all in the story and the acting but they did it wonderfully. There are no effects or crazy dramatics - just real cinema. Pure joy.
" Excellent
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,9,"This is a very good movie! Hilarious, different and realistic actually. I loved it!"
" Camden Street!
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,6,"Miss Shepherd's adventure was amazing and unusual but the movie itself was a bit flat I found it a bit hard to enjoy. But it was good to know that it was mostly based on real story, talking about Camden street, which I recently knew from Taylor Swift's London Boy song, hehe. And I loved the neighborhood."
" Amazing!!
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,10,"Amazing movie. I was very touched with a story. The actors are wonderful!! Watch, and you won't regret!!"
" better than the name suggest.
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,7,"This is a charming film of eccentricity total crazzy comedy, you don't need to be fan of alan bennet to enjoy this film."
" Maggie Smith delivers another outstanding character
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,9,It's a wonderful and seemingly simple movie but it true story lives in the effect that this vagabond woman has in the lives of those her who reside near her...This is an actor's movie... No CGI or gun fight or explosions and no rude F-bombs every few seconds... Just excellent acting... Maggie puts on a performance that should be a bench mark for true actors to obtain.
" Unlike Anything Else
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,7,"This movie gets off to an oddly slow start. My girlfriend walked out after 10 minutes. However, once I adapted to the unusual tone and realised that the movie was actually about the writer Alan Bennett rather than the eponymous Miss Shepherd, I really enjoyed it. Both Alex Jennings and Maggie Smith (obviously) produce excellent performances and it has more laugh out loud moments than the two 'comedies' that I saw at the cinema this month managed."
" I loved it and I almost cried
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,9,I remember my dad telling me to watch it with him. I did. At first I thought it was a little bit boring. That might have been because the overall feel is slightly gloomy. It is beautiful.
" Some excellent acting here....though I did not love the film.
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,6,"When ""The Lady in the Van"" begins, it says it's MOSTLY based on a true story. How much liberty Alan Bennett took with the actual story is anyone's guess, though apparently he DID allow a homeless and mentally ill woman to live in his driveway in her van. Why isn't 100% clear, as she was smelly, nasty, argumentative and had little positive about her. Fortunately, Maggie Smith did a brilliant job playing her and was very believable.As far as the story goes, there isn't much more to it. In the London suburb of Camden in 1970, Mary (or Margaret) began to become a bit of a nuisance in town. Bennett felt sorry for her and slowly forged an odd but distant relationship with her. Years after her death, he wrote a play about it...and the film is based on that play. The story has many unusual and surreal plot devices, such as having TWO Bennetts interacting and arguing with each other during the story. I think this film would appeal much more to older Brits than anyone else. That's because in the UK, Bennett is a famous writer and actor and is loved and respected. Here in the US, most folks have never heard of him or his groundbreaking show, ""Beyond the Fringe"". As for me, I found the film mildly interesting and I loved the performances....but the whole was not nearly as satisfying."
" Great writing, acting from all involved
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,8,"""The Lady in the Van"" is based on the true story of successful (though not socially successful) playwright and actor Alan Bennett, who reluctantly allows a very eccentric homeless woman (played with shrill comic delight by Maggie Smith) to park her decrepit, junk-filled yellow van in his driveway in an upscale suburb of London. She winds up staying there for years, and Bennett comes to care about her well-being more than he likes to admit. Through Bennett's witty, self-deprecating dialogue with the audience (fourth wall) as well as himself (he plays both himself and his alter ego, a more confident version of himself), the film reveals the gift of caring for someone selflessly, someone who is truly in need, who has been victimized -- and who isn't particularly grateful for the help. I watched ""The Lady in the Van"" at Christmas, and I think, though it is not a ""holiday movie"" per se, that it has a message that resonates at that time of the year. When you're worn out by the mall crowds and turned off by the crass commercialism, watch ""The Lady in the Van"" with a cup of hot, spiked tea. You will be moved and have a lot of laughs along the way, I promise. Excellent acting by both Alex Jennings as Bennett and Maggie Smith, as well as the many stars in supporting roles and cameos (most of the cast of Bennett's hit ""The History Boys"")."
" a mixed result
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,6,"Based on a true story, Mary Shepherd (Maggie Smith) is the title character: an elderly, homeless, delusional grouch who ends up parking her van in the driveway of writer Alan Bennett (Alex Jennings). Bennett wrote the movie as well as the play on which the film is based.Smith is a delight in this film as she is in everything she does. She is quite funny as someone who is almost always unpleasant. The rare times we feel sympathy for Mary is when we get glimpses into her past. Even if we dislike her, she is always interesting and we want to learn more about her.The same is not so much for Alan - a terrible irony as he is the writer of the story. Jennings does play him well and the character is self-effacing with his constant internal world. But we don't get to know him well until the end. He also seems to be one of those main characters who is ""too nice"" in bad sitcom plots: one who sets himself up for exploitation and is unwilling to stop the pattern.Much like some of her other recent films like ""Quartet"" and ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"", Smith raises the movie to a higher level. Let's hope this brilliant octogenarian can keep working for as long as possible."
" Unfortunately it's rather bland
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,5,"My biggest praise for this film is for the performances of Maggie Smith and Alan Jennings, who brought to life their characters extremely well. Smith shines as the eccentric and cantankerous Miss Shepherd who has a troubled past, whilst Jennings is also brilliant as Alan Bennett with his sharp wit and intellect providing for some funny moments. The relationship that builds between them is developed very effectively.However, I do have many problems with the narrative, mainly that it doesn't amount to much with so little actually happening in the story. I found it very hard to be engaged when most of it singly revolved around the interactions between Smith and Jennings with very little else going on. Also, learning about Miss Shepherd's past could have been quite intriguing but it just leads to some rather underwhelming reveals at the end with little deeper exploration into how she became the person she is.In the end I found this to be quite average, not terrible by any means, but not something I will ever have the inclination to watch again."
" IN LIFE, GOING DOWNHILL IS AN UPHILL JOB
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,10,"The film is based on a true story, shot on location where the event happened.Margaret T, Fairchild (Maggie Smith) aka Mary, is an elderly woman who lived in her van. In the opening scene, which is dark, there is an accident, one in which she runs from. She ends up in Camden Town and in the yard of playwright Alan Bennett (Alex Jennings). Bennett separates himself into two people, the author, and the individual who deals with stubborn woman in the van.As the film progresses, the glimpses we get of her younger life fill in, as we discover this is an educated woman, who is accomplished, and whose life is now being wasted. Alan constantly contrasts her to his own mother, in a home who doesn't remember him.But it is not a sad story. Maggie Smith gives us a delightful performance of a quirky woman with hygiene issues.Guide: Occasional F-word. No sex or nudity."
" Potent and poignant
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,10,"What a beautiful film. I can't understand how some reviewers have given it such low marks. You can almost smell Maggie Smith through the telly and the two Alan's are just perfect. As the story unfolds and more mysteries abound but are not revealed, the intrigue based around these two characters grows. ""Hold my Hand... it's clean"" sprung tears and made this film simply perfect."
" Avoid if you don't like Alan Bennett
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,5,"This was listed under 'comedy' on Netflix and my son chose it for us to watch together, after I insisted we watch something other than Pokemon... He thought it was going to be in the same David Walliams vein of The Boy In The Dress etc. It's not that kind of 'comedy' - and while almost all of it is family-friendly (just a couple of big swears), the central theme and wry observations from Alan Bennett will either go over the heads of little ones or will just come across as dull. The aforementioned Mr B is kind of a marmite writer in that he divides the audience. I find him smug and clever, without ever provoking more than a minor smile. 
It's the Carla Lane-esque summary of ""Life"" that I object to in his style. Things make him think (which is good) but inevitably he seems to conclude that his life is just boring and he's not living it enough etc. Quit moaning about not living and live it. Or, just quit moaning and accept that you'll never bungee jump in New Zealand or whatever ""Life"" Aside from my feelings towards Bennett himself, this was an enjoyable, if bemusing, film. Maggie Smith is impressive as the frankly unpleasant eponymous Lady.It's clear she has her problems, I just find it tragic, for her, that it take so long for them to be dealt with.Not exactly a typical odd-couple film."
" Winner All the Way Maggie Smith as Miss Shepherd -
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,6,"This is a true story that Alan Bennett wrote about a homeless lady Miss Shepherd who stayed in a van on the street near his house in seventies.The character of Alan Bennett is played excellently by Alex Jennings -who is always talking with his alter ego in the house, while he is scribbling his new play and notes in his book. The portrayal of Miss Shepherd is portrayed by Maggie Smith - and she lives the eccentric character - living under the skin. All awards - won or nominated were for Maggie Smith's brilliant performance. The story is about this girl Mary or Margaret (the younger version played by Clare Hammond) who is a gifted pianist, aspires to become a nun, but because of her argumentative nature is thrown away and admitted by her brother to an asylum from where she runs away and at one point in her life - has a car accident in which a young motor- cyclist dies. She does not report the incident and always blames herself - living under the fear that one day she might be arrested for the crime.There are several layers in the character of Miss Mary Shepherd that we come to know with each small episode she has with a big hearted Alan Bennett - who hesitantly gives her a temporary place to part the vehicle in front of his house, then in his empty front park - and that beautiful bond of LOVE relationship continues for 15 years till she dies. The real Miss Shepherd died in 1986, and she was granted a placard on the house of Alan Bennett by the community she lived in - which stands even today. The movie has wonderful chatty conversations and dialogues between Alan and Alan's alter ego interrupting Alan and Mary's conversations - that are sometimes hilarious Very well written and adapted screenplay from the memoir written by Alan Bannett by the same name.Made on a budget of USD 6 million, the movie has raked in more than USD 40 million worldwide. The Director Nicholas Hytner has done a commendable job in sticking to the authenticity of the narrative. What is beautiful about the character of Miss Shepherd is her unwillingness to leave her life on any one else's terms. Her stubbornness and whimsical eccentric nature holds on true to the humor and empathy she evokes.All is done well with the humanity and out-reach of Alan Bennett who though shies to recognize to his credit the give immortality to this affable character of Miss Shepherd by his memoir and later by this movie.The movie makes us sensitive to the way old people are neglected and suffer and how they need some support and LOVE from someone - although strangers.The memoir has also been enacted as a popular play in United Kingdom.I would go with 6.75 out of 10 for this nice to watch movie"
" Lady in the van: Maggie Smith's homeless adventure.
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,7,"Lady in the Van (2015) tells the true story of Alan Bennett's (Alex Jennings) uneasy friendship with an homeless elderly woman (Maggie Smith) who stayed in his driveway in a series of vans for 15 years. Over the course of those years he learns about the series of events that caused Mary Shepard to become homeless. Despite the possible grim subject matter of being homeless and suffering from the mental stress that comes from being homeless and guilt from past mistakes, the film maintains a fairly light-heated tone that makes the some of the bleaker aspects have more of an impact as well as make it more digestible. The trouble with these types of movies is that there is very little I can say about it that is not spoiling a joke or a major plot development. However what I can talk about is the performances.Maggie Smith is amazing, flat out amazing. She captures every scene she is in, whether it is insulting Alan Bennett or anyone around her or showing how badly old age decays her physical and mental health, the film also displays how a series of events led her into the terrible state she is in at the time of the film. Alex Jennings is great too, in fact everyone is great in this, and they deliver their lines with perfect comedic timing and grace that always ends in laughs. The writing for the first and second act oozes wit and charm, none of it feels forced for comedic effect or heavy handed. It keeps the pace flowing smoothly and is after all the film's most valuable assist. However this sadly becomes badly apparent in the third act.I will not give away any spoilers but it tries to introduce a Meta narrative that works as well into the pace and previous type of narrative as one running a hand over a cactus does to ease pain. It hurts the film and reduces what could have been a overall pleasant and haunting movie into a silly feature that thinks it is cleverer then it is.I did enjoy the film and I would watch it again. It is just a shame that the final act decides it wants to change the narrative in that the film had not earned or needed."
" Perfectly pitched and paced
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,9,"Unusually, the user reviews here are, almost all, well-considered, and there is little useful to add. Music, cinematography, editing, lighting all support the consistent high standard of acting and direction. The themes - compassion, loneliness, manipulation, love, old age and so on - are teased out in careful Bennett fashion. We are engaged and entranced by a film that does not disappoint, yet does not seek to promise more than it can deliver. I saw Maggie Smith play a youthful Desdemona to Laurence Olivier's Othello, and this, at the other extent of her acting life, is as riveting performance as I can remember."
" A good tale poorly rendered
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,6,"""Maggie Smith is Glorious"" boasts the cover of the DVD, and I wouldn't in any way contradict that, but she is the film's saving grace and the fact that the DVD contains an entire segment on ""visual effects"" reveals just how far from what was once a simple but endearing essay on English eccentricity this film has wandered. As with much of Bennett's work, it was in this simplicity that the attraction of the story lay, and moments of dialog in the script do hark back to that clarity. But with two Alan Bennetts, both with - to my ear - draining impersonations of Bennett's accent, an ensemble cast - many of whom seem to have been chosen for reasons other than their suitability for the roles and a frankly bizarre, Monty Python like final segment that fits like a spoonful of saccharine on top of a tablespoonful of sugar - what a disappointment!"
" Quirky Character Study
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,5,"(Flash Review)Would you allow a homeless woman, living out of a clunker of a van, to live in your driveway for an indefinite period of time? I would, if they were as funny as Chris Farley""living in a van down by the river."" Haha Thus the story revolves around a man too timid to make her leave after she has overstayed her welcome. Mainly because she is brash and bossy even within her life situation. The story felt thin as it was mainly insignificant interactions between the two of them with proper British manners so there's your humor. But there were no real significant memorable moments that drove the story along. There were some flashbacks to help paint the picture of her background but it never really had a moment that made sense as to how she ended up living this way. It had vibrant shot framing and a there was a little dual personality metaphor to show what the man was thinking and feeling compared to what he was doing by showing two of him on screen thus the movie took some chances. Not as quirky funny and bold as I had hoped."
" ""A Mostly True Story""
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,4,"Alan Bennett adapted his autobiographical 1999 West End play and subsequent BBC Radio 4 drama about a homeless woman in 1970 Camden named Mary Shepherd who needed a place to park her van, her home on wheels, after leaving it on the street has alerted the authorities. Bennett (played by Alex Jennings as a maybe-maybe not homosexual) is too polite to refuse Mary help, and so allows her to park her van in his driveway, where she stayed for some 15 years. Maggie Smith, recreating her stage success, is not portraying a charming vagabond, an irascible curmudgeon. Her Mary is an impossible handful, and one watches this film about her not knowing how to respond. If the picture is meant to be wily and eccentric, it fails because it isn't funny. When Shepherd needs medical help and the classical music is poured on, that doesn't work either, because this character as written isn't poignant. I tired of her long before the finish. *1/2 from ****"
" Maggie Smith is a joy....
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,9,If you have seen the trailer - you have seen most of the jokes in the movie. Which is not to negatively criticize it - it will get you through the door.What you then get is a nice study of an old lady living in a van in real playwright Alan Bennett's driveway for 15 years and of Bennett's introspection and observations that subsequently lead to the play and now movie.Maggie Smith is a joy as the cantankerous old lady with her personal demons.Filmed at the actual location of the real story - The street backdrop - set with a tour de force of the British car industry of the 1960's through late 1980's is an impressive feat by the producers in its own right!
" Rarely Have I Been So Bored
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,1,"I took this off the shelf at my local library thinking I would enjoy Maggie Smith and a British comedy. What a disappointment. Perhaps it is the way British people are portrayed as just so nauseatingly tolerant it makes me know how the country is in the state it is in now with the social justice warriors out in full force.Here you have this woman who for all intents and purposes is nuttier than a fruitcake, she stinks too, and yet the whole town seems bent on not appearing ""prejudiced"" and so they go along with it to make themselves feel better - they admit this. None of the characters held my interest including the milquetoast writer who ends up with her vehicle in his driveway for years.I am all for being intrigued by the lives of those who appear lost and homeless. But this was nothing but a vanity exercise for Smith and not a very good one. I would not want to live in this neighborhood and at the rate Britain is going, who else will want to either?"
" About how to love and be loved.
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,10,"I never take the time to review a movie, I don't think that my thoughts are important enough (at least talking about movies) for others to read them and also I hate to write in English -I have to think twice!- But this movie deserves it.As always, Maggie Smith makes and unforgettable performance. This time of Margaret Fairchild, an old woman who once was a pianist and a nun, but became an fugitive homeless who lives in a old van that eventually, as everything in her life that brings her joy, is painted yellow. All the Camden community (almost) is nice to her, but there is one person who is even more fond to her: Alan Bennett.While we see Alan speaking to himself, we also see how this lady manage to leave almost every day the van (and Alan's garage) to make a life: she goes to church, to shop groceries, and she even goes to the beach every now and then.With the time we get to know better the story of Mrs. Shepherd, and we get to love her more.This is a very well done movie with a peculiar and amazing ending. We all ought to see this movie."
" It's not important that it's almost all true...It's a great story
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,10,"The writer doesn't want to bother with the crazy woman in the van, but his other half can not turn away a needy person. The entire neighborhood grows and evolves around the woman in the van. Back in the day, when this originally almost truly happened, people were different. People cared for people. Miss Shepherd was portrayed perfectly by Maggie Smith. I love how she blurts out lines and then follows up with a sensible statement. You can see the fear she has about her past, and the need to know in her landlords expressions. The curiosity wants you to shot out: Tell me what happened to her. Why would she live in a van for so many years?I really liked this movie."
" Maggie Smith is Simply Brilliant
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,Stumbled upon this British movie by chance. What a pleasure to see Maggie Smith perform her craft so brilliantly. She never seems to fail to lift a film to such a high level of excellence. The story itself is mysterious from the beginning as we are led to wonder how she ended up homeless & living in a van. Some greet her with compassion and others with disdain. Alex Jennings as Mr. Bennet is equally as brilliant as a caring & kind writer along with his alter ego. How sad that only with death do those who could have given her some compassion in life only show up when she least needs them. In a perfect world I would only wish that people would care about the elderly and realize that they have many life stories that are worth listening to and not just discard them because they can not move as quickly and perhaps need someone who thinks that they even the elderly have a purpose. We will all be old someday....if we're lucky.
" Not as good as I thought it would be - how did it pass a 12a?
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,4,"I'm going to keep this brief as I don't want to add any spoilers. If you watch the trailer you will generally get the story quite quickly but it drags out a bit for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The acting is good but I wasn't impressed with the amount of swearing in it. For parents to take young children in (which I didn't but saw others) and then to have have ""F"" swear words mentioned in a 12a is pretty poor. I wouldn't recommend this for children and should be aimed at the 15 certification. I think there are times when our children are being desensitised to real events when they pick up words, actions and poor behaviour based on a movie. I know the BBFC has given it a 12a and left the decision to parents but from my experience a lot of parents are so naive about these things and then wonder why their child ends up swearing when they've just taken them to a movie full of it."
" Sweet bit flawed
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Sails a little close to sentimentality at times but perhaps that forgivable, a sweet story about a not so sweet lady. A great and largely true tale, Maggie Smith is magnificent and Alex Jennings very good. A special mention for Frances De La Tour and the score, both great. Why my reservations? Well not much happens which is fine, but this in turn, turns your attention to the characters and that's where TLIV misses the mark. I think the decision to cast Jennings as two Allan Benetts was a theatrical contrivance that doesn't gel cinematically. A voice over would have worked far better and elevated this good movie to great. So watch and enjoy but mark this down as a missed opportunity."
" A very pleasant surprise
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"Enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. Despite thinking very highly of Maggie Smith, Alex Jennings and Jim Broadbent et al, considering Alan Bennett a talented writer and liking previous work by Nicholas Hytner and George Fenton, the title was not particularly appealing to me, likewise with the subject matter based on a true story unfamiliar to me.What a pleasant surprise though. Although not a great film and having its faults, 'The Lady in the Van' is a good film with a lot to like and perfect for a rainy day or wanting to let your hair down and relax in the evening. A strong example of not judging a film by its title. Whether 'The Lady in the Van' will garner a wide audience is hard to tell, it is very quintessentially British with a subject matter that perhaps a lot of people won't know much about to properly connect with and the script is written in a style that will work for some and not for others.'The Lady in the Van' does have its flaws. The length of the film is longer than necessary for a story that is somewhat thin, meaning that there is some draggy pacing in the second half and some resolutions take too long to get there and feel too conveniently wrapped up.On top of that, the ending, despite having a genuinely moving build-up, seemed to be an attempt at pathos and being uplifting but ended up feeling clumsy, confusing and almost like a cheat (almost like the rest of the film didn't happen). Jim Broadbent's scenes didn't work for me either, they just felt out of place in the film and jar tonally and while Broadbent is a great actor he isn't particularly memorable here.However, 'The Lady in the Van' is beautifully filmed and handsomely produced, while George Fenton's music score is gentle and sometimes quirky and fits ideally with the film's mood. It also incorporates and arranges pre-existing classical music with ease, the use of Chopin's first piano concerto being the most striking and giving a real sense of pathos. There was the worry as to whether the humour would not feel right and do justice to a story that is quite tragic in a way.No worries there. The script, with Bennett's style written all over it, is subversive, thought-provoking in how its messaging and what it's trying (and succeeds) to say is conveyed and full of very sharp scathing witticisms, do admit to laughing out loud a number of times. Hytner's direction is understated but always with a sense that he knows what he's doing and where to go.Maggie Smith is truly magnificent here and worthy of some kind of award nod. Her character easily could have been an annoying caricature, especially in lesser hands, but Smith is often funny and deliciously batty but also gives the character a vulnerability. Alex Jennings is similarly marvellous and also deserving of award recognition, nailing Bennett's nuances, rhythm and how he speaks to a tee. The whole alter ego stuff is obvious early on and it is not always easy who is the real Bennett and who is the alter ego (only occasionally though), but that is in no way an issue, actually it was part of the fun. The chemistry between them is a joy and they work very well with the rest of the cast, who also do very well with some familiar and welcome faces.On the whole, a very pleasant surprise and much better than expected. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
