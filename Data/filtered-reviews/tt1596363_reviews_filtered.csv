" WOW
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,Just watched this movie ..10 out of 10 .. I used my tendies from gme and amc to watch this movie ..thanks hedgies.
" Rubbish.
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,1,"Not remotely funny. A boring film about unbridled greed. Lots of hand wringing. They are all villains. Glad I am not in their soulless,superficial world, with my ordinary job. Everything wrong with America is there."
" Not Everyone Lost in the Crash
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"Ignorances kill. A movie about bunch of weirdos that predicted the market crash in 2008.It is for sure one of the most confusing movie in terms of having words and terms that I don't know anything of. Since the director is aware of this, besides giving definition of terms in an edgy way, he used the stylistic choice of having celebrities explaining the terms using analogies that average audiences like me can understand. I definitely enjoyed this aspect and had more understanding of the terms, although they are still confusing.Amidst the loads of finance terms was the study of the characters who predicted the crash. This was where most of the comedy came from. Some of the characters were bizarre and interesting. They occasionally broke the 4th wall.The story itself was ridiculous and astonishing. You don't have to understand everything to see this. The movie showed how one concept, combining with ignorance and fraud, could lead to a disaster as well as pain and suffering to people. It also present moral consequences to these characters.My only problem with the movie was that the story took a lot of cognitive load to process, so sometimes I didn't care too much for the characters.Overall, an educational and entertaining movie. 8.5/10"
" 7/10
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,7,"An extremely funny and interesting movie. The acting is amazing. But extremely hard to understand if you are not familiar with this field. So just 7,5/10"
" SPECTACULAR
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,10,"I picked this up because of the cast.Great movie. Everyone is a standout. Steve Carrel steals the show.It's based on a true story, and is a good primer on short selling.You'll love it."
" Top cast tackle sub-prime shenanigans with a little too much style over substance
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,6,"The Big Short attempts to pull off a ruse: it feigns to give the audience a straight-talking dissection of how the 2007 financial disaster came about through the stories of a handful of characters who profited from it... but really it delivers a lot of buzzwords, bluster and Hollywood drama. It wants to be smart AND stylish, but really only achieves the latter.That's not to say it isn't entertaining, because actually the nuts and bolts of Wall Street don't matter all that much and all we really need to know is enough to become invested in the motivations and stories of the principal characters. It's the energy in the performances of these characters that drives the movie, and the cast is more than up for the challenge. Carrell especially continues to impress, but Gosling and Bale are great too, and Pitt is fine with his rather understated and vague character.The film tries to be cute with its fourth-wall breaking interludes, where celebrities motor-mouth their way through various investment concepts. It's a very self-aware film. Some people may find that entertaining, but I found it a little smug. It's all part of the ""we're drawing the curtain back on Wall Street nudge-nudge wink-wink"" vibe that movie tries to foster, but when the crisis finally hits, everything is all sizzle with a reliance on quick edits and slick dialogue to convey the chaos. Which is fine: this isn't a documentary, but at the same time I think the director relies a little too much on some self-satisfied bells and whistles.Overall, this was an entertaining watch. The topic is one that will prove endlessly fascinating for decades to come and it's easy to get swept away in the strong performances of the cast."
" 70% of the truth
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,7,"In the end, the movie concludes that Wall Street finds out that Wall Street is corrupt. This is where the movie falls Short Big time.Wall Street is always corrupt, but that is not what caused 2008. It was select individuals, less than 100 people, who were fully complicit and responsible for what occurred. And none were jailed or even audited. Today, they are among the ultrawealthy. Why do you think Hollywood was able to publish a movie about real corruption? Because they named no individuals or entities, they only blamed the industry at large. And that's how the real crooks win."
" Hot Garbage
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,1,"Overacted, pretentious pile of dung. Read the book instead."
" Watch a documentary instead...
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,2,"So - The Big Short. We all know that the economy crashed in 2008. And I would argue that less than 1% of the population understood why. I was one of the more than 99%. And I still am. If we want to learn more about the crash and how the rich guys all maintained their wealth at the expense of normal people I'd want to watch a documentary. Or read books. Or do extensive research on the net. What I wouldn't do is watch a theatrical film loosely based on the 'truth' and find myself rewinding when the film itself tries to 'explain' - through random celebrities - what the hell is going on. But I did find myself constantly rewinding. I found myself googling all sorts of acronyms that this up its own arse film threw at me. I hated all the characters. I hated all the reconstructions. And most of all, I hated the film. I like a film to move me. Or educate me. Or entertain me. This film did none of that. But - as my unwritten rule forces me to - I watched til the bitter end. I'll give it 2 out of ten - but only because I did learn a bit about shorting (thanks to looking it up rather than anything the film told me). Alas, to be fair I'd rather hate a film than find it merely meh as it at least provoked a reaction in me. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
" Great film but convoluted with too many details!!
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,8,"I really like the film but it goes into too many specifics which you may or may not like. If you avidly follow the stock market and are aquatinted with the terminology, you will really enjoy the film. Otherwise, it's pretty good watch but you will miss out on some very specific details as to why the housing market crashed in such a big way.I recommend watching a crash course on youtube on the 2008 financial crisis before watching this film. It will make it a lot easier to understand."
" excellent educational movie with an all-star cast
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,10,"Christian Bale brings his best intensity to his role as a Wall Street savant. As a serial poor investor myself...well my book learning is top grade but I have a terrible track record, I have lost hundreds of thousands. But there is always 'next time'. In financial markets opportunities appear and disappear on a weekly basis. Patterns repeat. History repeats. Humans are mortal creatures with short memories. One feature of the American housing market is that mortgagees can hand back to the keys to their bank and bail out anytime they want. We can't do that here Down Under, your house debt is still your house debt whether you live there or not. But if you like your house and want to live there long-term it does not matter if the market goes up or down, if you can meet your payments well in 20 or 30 years time you will have it payed off and have a valuable asset. That is what I would advise any young person. Its a great feeling having your own house with a backyard and frontyard. You can have cats and or dogs, a garden, anything you want. Its your place ! Its the best investment you can ever make for yourself, your own place. It really doesn't matter if you buy at the top of the market and then the housing market crashes, 20 years later you will be winning Bigly. Most people like me, well I buy lottery tickets, but I really don't need to be rich, just enough money to pay the bills is enough for me. Being average is a gift. Money could buy me love but not happiness. Paul McCartney was so wrong about that, money can buy you love. A old short ugly bloke becomes immediately loveable to women when he has a hundred million dollars in the bank, funny about that. Shout out to Woody Allen and Danny De Vito!"
" 6.6
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,8,Not really my taste in films. Some nice scenes and an interesting movie but my stupid brain didn't understand the half of it which most certainly brought down the experience for me. I would've enjoyed it more had i understood it better i think. maybe now that im older i'll give it a rewatch.-watched alone
" False is like gravity, it may take time but IT WILL FALL.
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Yes I am into markets , I like this stuff , but this movie is more than that, it's about the system which is always wrong but just floating on lies and fraud.The makers tried hard to make it understand, I got most of it, but I feel it can be made simpler, so people know how sick this world of money is .And the Jewish socialist is great , I meat he is the one ."
" Insightful masterpiece
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,"This film successfully depicts the 2008 recession with a insightful, emotional, intriguing and comedic display.The characters in this story were portrayed masterfully by the actors, with Steve carrel being a stand out performer, While Christian bale was tremendous as always."
" An indigestible and hermetic theme that, deconstructed and explained, gave rise to a good film.
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,7,"The economic crisis from 2008 to 2012 is something we all remember. More or less, most people in the US and Europe suffered with that. The film focuses entirely on the way it all started: the American housing bubble, the way greedy banks were ignoring danger signals in order not to compromise profits, and the way a very small group of economists and speculators realized, with some time to prepare themselves, what would happen, and the repercussions that such a big bubble would have for the whole world.The film is good, but it is very complex and on a theme that will not please everyone. The economy, with all its own professional slang, is not something that comes to our mind when we think of entertainment. Even so, the script did an excellent job by trying to create a story over a seemingly indigestible topic and making a remarkable effort to explain everything in an easy-to-understand way. The subplots have been used very well and help to make the film appear to have more stories to tell than it actually has.The cast is good and full of actors that we easily recognize from other works. For me, the two most notable artists present here are Christian Bale and Steve Carrell. Both did good jobs, giving life to two economists portrayed in an unorthodox way: one is an amateur drummer and an unconditional hard rock fan; the other is conflicted and easily gets into trouble and arguments. Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt also did a good job on this film, although their characters are relatively unremarkable.Technically, the film has immense quality points: it has a good cinematography, with well-achieved colors and excellent light. The sets and costumes do not disappoint, but neither are they surprising. The pace of the film is relatively fast and the feeling that prevails is that it is necessary to review some parts of the film to fully understand what is going on."
" Venal goes viral...
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,7,"This is a fascinating appraisal of the antics on Wall Street leading up to the global economic crash that started with the collapse of the American mortgages market in the mid 2000s. Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell are superb as the three men who identify and appreciate the risks, capitalise on the flaws and who ultimately epitomise the woefully lacking standards of regulation and comprehension by market and government alike; coupled with degrees of avarice that would make King Midas want to blush. The pace of the film is gripping - plenty of parallel threads that gradually conjoin to create a compelling narrative well exemplified by a cast at the top of their game delivering a taut, fast moving adaptation of Michael Lewis' frequently jaw-dropping book. The technique of using real celebrities (like Margot Robbie & Selena Gomez) to illustrate some of the more abstruse aspects of these bewildering processes is effective, and the supporting cast - especially Brad Pitt (who reminded me a lot of Robert Redford), as perhaps the most odious of all: he knew the likely pitfalls for the ordinary people of their scheming, but proceeded regardless - Rafe Spall and Finn Wittrock add marvellously to this. What is does lack, though, is any sort of political dimension. It sets it's sights fairly on the excesses of the businesses, but focusses not at all on the incompetencies of regulators and politicians alike, which does present us with a bit of bias as to the complicity of many, many more than just the bankers in this disaster. It has a degree of thinly woven humanity to it, but sadly illustrates all to clearly how profligacy and greed prevailed in the absence of any real sense of decency or integrity. The last ten minutes is particularly potent - or should that be portentous...?"
" Watch this
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,10,"Watch this and Margin Call and educate yourself on how greed, ignorance and confidence in financial markets will always repeat itself."
" Film Garbage
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,1,"If films are considered the 7th Kind of art, I wonder of this piece of trash reach level1"
" Sobering story
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,9,"This was a very compelling depiction of the collapse of the American economy and big banks, led by fraud and deception of the American public who just wanted to own homes. Very sad and upsetting that this occurred, but the story was very well told. Terrific performances by Christian Bale and Steve Carrell in particular."
" Unique to disguise the exposition
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,4,"Inherently a film about the 2008 financial crisis and concepts such as sub prime mortgages or collaterized debt obligations among mant other topics the average viewer has no understanding of,you are fated to have a lot of exposition. The Big Short goes for a very 'artistic' style by breaking the fourth wall with celebrities in cameo roles literally explaining what it all means. And that's the film's entire approach,to try and be as different as possible and hope that its mistaken for quality. But It doesn't matter in what unique or quirky way you try and package it,it still remains very undramatic.
As mentioned above,this a tough subject to make a film on but that excuse still doesn't suffice for The Big Short's shortcomings."
" Eccentric yet Amazing
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,8,"This movie was a great experience to watch. The transitions between humour and horror were wonderful. Christian Bale, Steve Carrell and Jeremy Strong carried their respective characters with a great deal of depth. I personally loved their performances. Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling were also great but they had relatively shorter screentimes which sums up the amazing cast which got me to watch the movie.The writing was fantastic. I loved the idea of using celebs to explain financial terms. This is where they creatively performed much better than Margin Call. Also since it is based on a true story, many a times the scene would stop and the person would talk to the camera giving his/her opinion or telling us how things worked out in real which kinda worked for me. It gave me the feel of the documentary with the spice of a film."
" Great depiction of our society and economy.
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,"I've wanted to watch this movie for ages, but for some reason I never managed until last night, and boy, is it good!! Better than I imagined.I had to follow the dialogues very carefully since I'm not very familiar with the terms (swap, CDO, etc.) and although it's quite long, the movie captures your attention all the time.The cast is great, with Christian Bale stealing the show as the disfunctional but brilliant Wall Street guru. The real surprise, though, is Steve Carell with his intense portrayal of Mark Baum (I had no idea he is a comic actor and that he played in ""The 40-year Virgin"" and ""The Office"". His interpretation of the tortured character of Mark Baum is really compelling.If you have like ""Capitalism, a Love Story"" by Michael Moore, you'll love this one as well."
" Didn't love the ending, but a great film on the whole.
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,"I haven't particularly liked any of Adam McKay's work before this, but this is my favourite of his films by far. The performances are great as expected, but I just loved how the dialogue flowed really well. I doubt I understood everything in the film, but I know a hell of a lot more than I did before watching, so I didn't mind that. Most of my enjoyment comes from the fantastic script, which built up tension throughout. I enjoyed the breaking the fourth wall, and the film had plenty of humour that kept it fairly light, at least until the ending.I think that's where my biggest issue with the film arises - there is no reason to care about the characters because they're such terrible people. The whole film presents the banks as being the big evil villains, but in reality these people are just as bad for profiting off the economy failing. The film tried to address this at the end, but it was too late, and it meant I wasn't particularly emotionally invested in any of the characters.But regardless, more or less every other element worked for me. I enjoyed the editing style, and thought it worked much better at complimenting the story than in Vice, although I still thought it was distracting in a couple of emotional scenes. But yeah, overall I just enjoyed this more than I thought I would, and I would recommend it."
" Hey-ho.
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,8,"The credit crunch of 2008 was ugly. This film portrayed ugly well. Betting against success is ugly.
Case closed.
Hard to enjoy a film that shows economic destruction. Again. At the cost of the poor.
Well told and explained by breaking the 4th wall, but the message is undeniable. Greed is ugly.
Hey ho."
" Good movie
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,8,"Great movie kinda hard to follow unless you're 100% devoted to watching it, definitely not a movie you can clean your room while watching it in the background."
" Don't look away for a second
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,9,"I'm not the smartest person in the world I'll openly admit that. However if you concentrate on the film it makes sense trust me. I loved the bits where it cut to Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez and that chef where they explained what was going on, that helped a lot. I find it absolutely mind blowing that this is a true story. I loved watching so many world class actors working together. Incredible film, it's a must watch."
" simple review
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,10,Splendid movie. Great actor perfomances! Ridiculously good sountrack!
" My Lord This Movie Is Genius
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,9,"What starts out appearing as what's going to be a wacky comedy about the 2008 meltdown--think like a 2008 ""Wolf of Wall St.""--doesn't waste any time turning into a thrilling suspense story as a small group of men (in unrelated events) slowly begin to understand that an unthinkable economic meltdown is coming and nobody realizes it.Or, those that do are hiding it.Yeah, there's a ton of laughs--mostly from Ryan Gosling's character--but it really is a serious drama the more it unfolds. Steve Carell is the standout in the cast whose character originally appears to be neurotic comic relief but quickly becomes the guy who figures out the entire house of cards.It's also a perfect explainer for what happened in 2008--no, it's not as ""complicated"" as some would have people believe. Even better, there's some great stunt cameos (I won't spoil who they are) that show up to explain--to the camera--what things like CDOs are.The ending is especially heavy as you realize that more than a few people warned about this but they were ignored. It didn't have to happen."
" To much incomprehensible economy for me
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,5,"I'm not saying this movie is bad, but in my opinion is to complicated for people who not know too much about economy and stock exchange. It's for some who are interested about it and like it."
" Not as understandable as it should be
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,8,"I take it the makers did their best to explain what happened in the 2008 Great Recession, but they fell short and there's much I couldn't wrap my head around. Still, kudos to them for giving their all."
" A Great Movie but Also a Complicated one.
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,7,"From the first while you will know that you are about to see greatness, a great acting level, an unbelievable scintific scenario, but at the end you will find that you have passed many lines because you are not supposed to be an economic expert or smart analyst to understand all that bit of knowledge and education, at the end the movie was so complicated to me to understand it all, which is contrasting with the basic idea of the cinematic artform ""Movies should facilitate it self"""
" Enjoyable the first time, but improves with every watch
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,9,"Let's be under no illusions here.. the subject matter of The Big Short is quite hard to initially follow. The directors knew this, which is why they did a great job making the film watchable by adding humorous scenes such as Margot Robbie explaining CDO's, and Ryan Gosling talking directly to the camera to explain the differences in the film and what happened in real life! It works really well.
Overall the film has a similar 'feel' to the Wolf of Wall Street, but it is by no means a copy.As I said at the beginning, it is quite hard to initially follow the subject of the film. Shorting CDO's and Mortgage tranches are complicated to understand, but the film does a great job explaining everything. Obviously this is done fairly quickly so the film still flows, so I thoroughly recommend watching the film again. I've watched it about 4 or 5 times now, and each time I learn a little more, which helps understand what caused the banking crisis of 2008, and also adds to the enjoyment of the film.Acting wise, there are some great characters played by so many A list actors that it really does feel like a true blockbuster film, despite seeming to appear quite under the radar when it first came out.
Christian Bale excels as always, and it's nice to see Steve Carrell play a more serious role, although some of his scenes that would have been serious at the time in real life, are made very amusing by the way Steve plays them.
Ryan Gosling also amuses at every opportunity. Playing an excited city trader suits him well, and the scene where he is on the phone in the bathroom is fantastic!Overall, I can really recommend this film. But like I say, if you don't really get it fully the first time, then please watch it again as once it starts to make sense it gets even better!"
" Masterful drama well deserved of its Oscar win for best screenplay
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,"I originally saw in the theater with my mom that was fun, happy to own now. I absolutely love everything about The Big Short the writing, editing is smooth, music/sound is so great, and cast is one of the best ever! Such a sophisticated well orchestrated story about the 2008 stock market crash and economy collapse. Movies about society struggles are my favorite especially when they are as well done as this! Christian Bales character is phenomenal really stands out to me seems like he an played an autistic savant which I am too to some extent."
" This film can turn you into a communist!
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,9,"Before watching the film I thought it was a simple story of some lucky and visionary people who had made a fortune betting on the fall of the real estate market, which is not wrong but the film is much more than that!
I was shocked to see the other side of the coin, which is the desperation of 8 million people who became unemployed due to the fact that some banks are greedy and poorly control the main (real estate) market on which the American economy was based.
The performance of the actors was spectacular but I would like to highlight that of Steve Carrel who was completely out of this world! Brad Pitt went almost unnoticed in this film, in which he assumed in addition to the role of Ben and the role of co-producer. Innovative work by Adam McKay, clever choice to make the movie in The Office style, allowed the contents to be better explained."
" MBS and CDO = Creative ways to f@@k people.
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,9,"I want to say this should be required viewing for every citizen but what's the point? People don't want to hear bad news so they just tune it out.
Watch this and you will miles ahead of the herd."
" Didn't make me fully care about its subject matter...
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,6,"Adam McKay is a very hit or miss director for me. I quite like Anchorman or Step Brothers even though I think they're not particularly amazing. The Big Short is so far his best work.The Big Short follows a group of investors who bet against the US Mortgage Market and soon discover how corrupted and flawed the system is.I've never been too fond of Adam McKay's comedies so I decided to give a chance to one of his more serious films and I think it's pretty good. What really makes The Big Short work is the dialogue and performances. The screenplay written by Adam McKay and Charles Randolph is brilliant. I really felt as if I was transported to Wall Street and was watching a group of businessmen rather than actors. The dialogue is very detailed and filled with a lot of business terms that most people may not understand. McKay and Randolph do their best to simplify the dialogue by constant fourth wall breaking and exposition delivered by random celebrities. Sometimes that choice works and sometimes it doesn't. The film goes by pretty quick and with a lot of complex terms being thrown around, it can be hard to keep up. The film delves into a subject that I have no interest in and because of that I wasn't as invested as I could have been. It really tries to make you care about what's going on but I couldn't get into it completely.The acting is really fantastic. Ryan Gosling serves as the narrator for the most part but he does a decent job. Brad Pitt isn't in the film that much but he was great whenever he was on scene. My two favourite performances were given by Christian Bale and Steve Carell. Bale plays a character that isn't very social but knows his line of work well and he did a fantastic job as his character. Foxcatcher showed me how Carell can take on a more dramatic role and he really stood out here. His character gets more and more angry as the film goes on and Carell played it really well.I don't think The Big Short is bad. The acting and dialogue is terrific throughout but some of the stylistic choices and the subject matter as a whole didn't make me fully care about what was going on."
" Interesting, entertaining but too technical
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,7,"""The Big Short"" is indubitable a good movie and I personally love Adam McKay's style so this film is a positive one for me. It is about the economic crisis of 2008 and some men that were able to foresaw it and exploit the situation to their advantages. The screenplay is interesting but I have to say is difficult to follow without a good knowledge about economics. The picture does a decent job in trying to explain all the technical things with some clever scenes but I'll admit I would have liked to have a degree in economics. All the other aspects are great as you can expect from McKey, Carrel, Gosling, Bale and Brad Pitt. In conclusion: be ready to have your mind active during the watching but if you can watch it because it's worthy."
" Monumental lead performances turn even the most depressing subject matter into an engrossing masterpiece
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,8,It is a true testament to the brilliant writing and acting on show that the portrayal of such a hideous event could be so entertaining and amusing.
" A movie everyone should be aware of
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the few movies that I finished watching and I had to search up if everything that happened in the movies was real because this was honestly one of the most shocking things I've ever seen. While ""Top 10 things that make you say wow!"" makes me think ""huh, interesting"", this movie made me question reality. The fact that all the thing covered in this movie is not basic knowledge is terrible. This is one of the few movies that I think that everyone should watch not because I personally enjoyed it, but because everyone should be aware of what happened in 2008."
" NOT FOR EVERYONE
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,4,"I'm a science student, This movie need a knowledge of economics."
" Poor genius
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,9,"I can't understand some parts of the film, cus I'm not American, haven't experienced it, and not that interested in American's history. But I could definitely say, it is a masterpiece. Genius at that time were so poor. They tried to use their talent to make money for themselves, at the same time, tried to help people. People were just numb. They didn't care about their money, their lives. And when they lost everything, what they could do was crying, they did so in the end actually. 2008, what a crazy year. Leaders did nothing to help, they made it happen."
" Yeah
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,7,"Good movie. Decent film on the financial crisis. Explains everything is layman's terms. Yet some of the stuff is rather complicated. Gosling is cool, Carrell is ordinary, Bale is interesting, and Pitt isn't that good. The cameos are funny and refreshing.I like it. Nice suit and tie movie.Watch7 stars"
" To date, my favorite film
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,10,"There are so many classic films in existence. But I've found myself of late watching this little gem over and over again these days.It's intriguing. I mean, you know what happens, however, there's these characters who you're rooting for who are actually betting against you! If there's a collapse in the economy, then in hindsight, the banks lose, and we lose. Yet, you fall in love with these guys who are set to make millions from our demise.It's a complicated viewpoint, but that's what makes the movie beautiful... It's uplifting, yet a timely reminder that when the fit hits the shan, you really can't touch the 1%"
" Compelling explanation
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,8,"This film had a very big challenge ahead of it - portray the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis to a lay audience in a way that's both understandable and accurate. The filmmakers did a fine job achieving this delicate balance. There are plenty of characters and lots of jargon, but it holds the audience's hand along the way with some visual metaphors and fourth-wall-breaking demonstrations (my favourite is the one with the chef). There were a lot of good actors and we feel what they feel in their journey - so much trepidation and doubt, then anger. The style of storytelling makes the topic very accessible and entertaining."
" Let's pause (too often) to explain things
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,6,"This film attempts to explain the 2008 financial collapse of Wall Street through the eyes of several groups of outsiders who figured out what was going to happened and gambled on making big money from the disaster. The cast is excellent, although having characters pause to explain things to the audience, or having celebrity cameos (Selena Gomez??) illustrate what was happening with analogies like observers betting on whether a gambler will win at blackjack, don't help explain things. I must confess that, having seen several films or TV productions about this crisis I still don't understand how ""mortgage-backed securities"" works. I guess that's why I was never good at economics. And does Brad Pitt have to be in every movie he co-produces?"
" Great
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,8,"Even though I did not understand 50% of the financial things explained in the film, I still enjoyed it.
The film tries a lot to explain what is going on by some entertaining bits. Even after all that, it is still difficult to understand.
What I loved about the film was the performances of all the actors, especially Steve Carell and Christian Bale. They are just amazing. Ryan Reynolds does a great job as well.Overall, it is a good watch. I would have given 10/10 if I had understood the film more."
" Creativity and charisma provide a fun film about finance!
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,7,"The Big Short has balls. Take an A-list cast, tackle the most depressing yet complex financial crash of our generation and somehow avoid a bore-fest of Excel Spreadsheet proportions. Thanks to a lot of panache and creative risks McKay achieves this feat. Most of the characters are cyphers and there's too many to really attach much emotional significance to. Though Carrell wins the day for personifying the audience's natural outrage at events, in his typical comic manner. Pace drops a little in the final act, but the gravitas of the message is expertly blended with entertaining originality."
" Good film
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,7,Didn't know how realistically how the trading world look like but to me this is a good film. I love the dialogue. I love the way they explain a difficult things to understand. I love the storyline too. The acting is good. The production design is good. The cinematography also good.
" Top line up
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,10,This is one of the best in class cast I ever see a movie. I didn't totally understand the things going on in this movie but I enjoyed it watching.
" The dialogues and attention to detail is mind-blogging!
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,9,Movie really gets into the details of the 2009 economic depression. The details of true events and the storyline to show is very goodVery capturing movie and keeps on seat for the complete time
" Confusing at the best
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,6,"I have very mixed feelings about this movie. I sort of liked it and liked how everybody played (even though Christian Bale overdid it a bit), but on the other hand, I feel completely stupid as almost everything what was happening in the movie was totally over my head... even after all explanations. The only thing I have actually got is how synthetic CDO's work, but still in a complete darkness about not-synthetic ones.So, to fully enjoy this movie, you need to be preferably an American (to feel this frustration of the system) and have to know all terminology that they used and there is a lot of it.All in all, still recommended, but be prepared, it may be over your head."
" Honestly horrifying
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,7,"I love how this movie tries to dumb down the complicated ecomics to the point of literally using Jenga blocks to explain them and I still have no idea what anyone's talking about. It's like I'm watching Primer all over again.This movie really creates a sense of impendending doom, and I really like how it gets more and more serious as it goes on. The editing is incredibly jarring but feels very on purpose.All the actors are great here, especially Steve Carrell. He's the best of cast. Brad Pitt in this film is a 2020 mood. Christian Bale is my spirit animal. Ryan Goslin reminded me of Jeff Winger from Community for some reason. He pretty much calls the audience a little b*tch for the whole movie and honestly, I'm ok with that."
" Review - The Big Short
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,6,"A lot of very good performances by an all-star cast. particularly from Christian Bale in this movie. I thought that he was playing just fine is role as an introvert analyst, and correctly understood the character's mental evolution concerning his successes.What I hold back against his movie is the direction style and the lack of emotion.First of all, the shaky camera movement felt like a documentary, but on the other hand, it is just to understated to be appreciated as a satire of the camera works in documentariesThe lack of range in the emotions depicted is a bit frustrating. It worked fine for Christian Bale's introvert. However, it isn't normal that the most heartbreaking/shocking moment in the movie is the archive images and the description of the events during the credits.The fourth wall breaking is not particularly well-handled either, it was another lame to be cool and dynamic, but it is likely to disrupt your viewing experience.To conclude, this is an alright movie which however contains major issues. It isn't a must-watch, many had similar ideas about the narrative structure before like Lord of War, and House of Card. Adam Mckay simply pushed the concept further, and that is what made The Big Short an unnecessary scapegoat"
" I literally didn't understand anything

" Life is often scarier than fiction
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,8,"The 2007-2008 financial crisis was a dark time for many people across the world. It should go without saying that economics is an extremely complex subject that no single person fully understands. It can seem kind of far away now, given recent events, but it was a huge deal at the time. And despite that, a lot of people still do not understand it because, again, economics is complicated. So how do you put a topic like into a format the average layman can understand? Why you turn it into a black comedy film of course! Enter, The Big Short.A comedy movie about people in high society doing bad things for money is not exactly a new concept. Every few years we see one of these, like The Big Short or The Wolf on Wall Street. And they are as hilarious as they are terrifying. I like watching horror movies, I've seen more than 1,000 of those things, and these films are scarier than anything in the horror category.Now, you always have to take these ""based on a true story"" movies with a grain of salt. But The Big Short was surprisingly good about this. Not 100% good, but better than most other films. The big thing is that the movie portrays the characters as if they were the only ones to see the financial crisis coming. But a lot of people back then knew there was a housing bubble. The thing that made these people special was figuring out it would happen soon. And the movie makes a big point of them researching the housing market and realizing how rotten the banking industry's system is. It turns out that people buying houses they couldn't afford with money they didn't have from the banks that weren't paying attention was a bad thing. Who knew?And at the end of the day, you cannot really argue that the protagonists are good people. They are all banking on the economy to collapse and have set themselves up to profit from the disaster. But the flipside of that is: what else were they supposed to do? The goal of any business, banks included, is to make more money constantly. Gotta keep those shareholders happy, baby. They probably would have been laughed out of the room even if they could have gotten some banking or government bigwigs to listen to their argument. The lack of action against the bankers following the financial crisis seems to back that up.Anyway, this is a film everyone should watch since it is a very important piece of recent history. And it's just, you know, a good movie. Great actors, a strong script, and a portrayal of real-world events that will keep you up at night. Good times."
" Didn't fully understand the film but I enjoyed it
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,7,"This film truly made me believe that you don't have to understand a film 100% To enjoy it.A lot of my friends told me that this film is complicated that they don't get it. That they were bored watching it.I guess they were kind of right.
Because For me personally I didn't understand the film 100% . but I understood somethings Like the story. Etc etc. simply I got the gist of it.The film is about the economic crisis that happened in the USA in 2008 and especially few people who strived through that time by using a stock method that was overlooked By the government and the banks. That was very risky and Will only win and benefit them when a crisis happens and it made them very very rich.I understand why a lot of people including my friends which funds is film boring and a little bit complicated we are not from America. we don't understand how it happened and why it happened and what was the feeling of the people when the crisis happened. And we don't understand a lot about this stock market and about stocks.this movie tried to explain what happened but I think that the normal viewers would need more simplified shortened explanation.All that being said I enjoyed the film I laughed in some scenes this film is surprisingly funny. I enjoyed the ending because those people believed in something that the whole world were against and were laughing at them but they won and they got very rich."
" Solid film
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,8,"Overall the topic is really well presented and captivating to watch. Some notes:impeccable performances by Christian Bale and Steve Carellenjoyable action stops when someone comments on the veracity of a scenethe bits with celebrities like Selena Gomez and Margot Robbie explaining finance terms were quite extra; they were reminiscent of the Wolf on Wall Street, and perhaps showed the insecurity that the film could be truly enjoyable without some standard Hollywood beauties popping every now and thengreat soundtracktouching ending"
" Do not waste your time
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,1,"Wolf of Wall Street without the drugs, hookers and jokes. I watched this film with the high hopes of an insight into the stereotypical enthralling life of a stockbroker in New York and was given almost a University lecture in economics. The whole film built up to the climax of the market crash and ended as soon as it happened without showing any of the aftermath. Totally boring."
" I love the editing of this movie

" Fantastic!
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,9,"The Big Short is such a frustrating story to watch, providing us with a peak behind the curtain of the collapse of the American housing market and the eventual global financial crisis of 2008. I say frustrating because the story delves even deeper into the apathy of big banks in causing this crisis. Their willingness to driving the economy off the edge of a cliff, knowing that they had a parachute with a healthy bonus to boot is maddening.It's a story told from the interwoven perspectives of three different investment fund managers, with the addition of Ryan Gosling's Deutsche Bank worker in the mix. The Big Short is a little hard to follow at times, not unexpected due to it's subject matter. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on mortgage bonds, funds, credit ratings etc, although thankfully the film is pretty forgiving in assuming a lack of knowledge. In an inspired move, the film introduces several well known celebrities such as Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez in fourth wall breaking intermissions to explain terminology. That still didn't get me up to speed, but it helped. Other fourth wall breaking asides from Gosling also helped to provide context around meaty financial concepts.With this in mind, The Big Short did a great job in making what could have been an incredibly dense and boring subject into a fast paced and gripping story. Unsurprisingly a lot of this is due to the star studded cast. Ryan Gosling injected the majority of the humour into the film, playing a no nonsense banker out for a profit, the Wall Street archetype. Christian Bale, as expected, gave a well measured and precise portrayal of the socially awkward and brilliant fund manager. The real standout for me was Steve Carrell, who plays yet another fund manager, but a much more cynical one, who, due to his empathy, we can relate to most as an audience. All the performances were great, but these three were the real standouts.The Big Short triumphed in many other areas as well. The direction was so slick and Adam McKay really excelled. As mentioned, he managed to transform what could have been a very heavy film into something more resembling a thriller! Truly remarkable in my book. The soundtrack was perfect and used very well throughout to heighten the drama and suspense where necessary.Despite the ins and outs going over my head, The Big Short manages to be really engaging, exciting, and also funny in parts! Definitely deserving of its several Oscar nods, a great film."

" Wall Street to Dark Hour
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,8,"The wages of avarice is death. On Wall Street, where everyone wants to go, their desires are infinitely inflated, and it seems that making money is too easy to expand to obscure the most basic moral bottom line. It doesn't matter if the banker sacrifices the basic livelihood security of thousands of ordinary mortgage lenders for his own wealth and wealth. Although the film shows some mavericks, Mark who scoffs at all immorality, Micheal, who closed the fund after the subprime mortgage crisis, has long been disappointed in the financial circle, and then the golden pot washes his hands to start rural life. After all, the race is still a minority. Financial practitioners have spent a lot of time and effort to make themselves an ""elite"". Why not invest so much in making money to make money? However, according to the values of my favorite lawyer, Gumimen, everyone is desperate to protect their own interests. Such survival of the fittest is truly unconstrained social justice. Whether the rights are too concentrated and whether ordinary people have no way to do it depends on how you view fairness."
" Good but not the best. Lacks relevent analysis.
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,7,"As a financier myself I love a good finance related movie provided the plot is accurate and sophisticated enough not to patronise the audience.
This movie unfortunately fails to a certain extent on those factors.
The key drivers of the 2008 crash are discussed but they are revealed in a somewhat flippant and over simplistic way that doesn't really properly explain real events.
We have cuts to famous celebs explaining to the dumb viewer in a ridiculously convoluted manner, the workings of CDOs or Synthetic CDOs. OK it probably decently educates many who are clueless on these systems and correctly displays how the banks and brokers and investment trusts manipulate and suck the money out of the average working person through shady deals and counter deals but this is only just the tip of the iceberg.
The daylight robbery of the American people began long before 2008 when Nixon took the US Dollar off the Gold standard and turned it into fiat. The printing began robbing Americans of their savings, their salaries and their wealth on a drip drip basis. Asset bubbles already began to build long before 2007 and the SubPrime Scandal was only one of many pins that popped the bubble.
The banks and investment managers are crooks but the biggest crook of all is Uncle Sam and the Fed.The Big Short has good enough suspense with great performances by Carroll & Gosling. Bale
tries a bit too hard on a slightly autistic caricature of Burry and Pitt is largely superfluous to the dynamic.Its way better than Dubuque's ""The Accountant"" in its sophistry but well short of the reaches of ""Margin Call"" , ""Inside Job"", ""Wall Street"" ""The Wolf of Wall street"" or ""Equity"".Nevertheless, more of this genre please."
" Astonishing true story adaptation
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,10,"The Big Short is an astonishing adaptation of a true story that's shocking, powerful and very funny. Ryan Gosling is perfect, Steve Carell gives a career best performance and Brad Pitt and Christian Bale are both incredible. Finn Whittrock, John Nagari, Rafe Spall, Jeremy Strong and Hamish Linklater are all great. Adam McKay's direction is incredible and really inventive showing he handles drama just as effectively as comedy. It's extremely well filmed and extremely well paced. The soundtrack is great."
" One hell of a movie!
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,9,"I feel privileged to have been able to see this movie. It was an excellent piece of work. The events that happened in2007-2008 continue to affect us 12 years later, and this movie shows us the view from the inside, how the greed of Wall Street led to a disaster, how easily it could have been avoided if we had looked more closely and how they still haven't learned their lesson.This was a star-studded movie, and all the actors were awesome, but Steve is without a doubt the brightest star in this one. I also appreciate the effort to try to make some complex concepts understandable to us, and it definitely makes the movie a bit more watchable. The scene with Selena Gomez and a Nobel laureate was really cool. This is a movie that every adult should watch"
" The Corrupt Leading The Corrupt In Compelling Style
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,9,"Director Adam McKay has a very unique style of filmmaking. You'll probably love it or hate it, with little in-between. For me, his crazy antics work perfectly in ""The Big Short"", telling the story of the 2008 housing crisis and subsequent Wall Street meltdown.For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how Wall Street investors and bankers created a housing bubble that essentially broke the economy. Ostensibly narrated by the Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) character, it also focuses on Mark Baum (Steve Carell), an investor betting against the ""common practice"" for his own profit, and Michael Burry (Christian Bale), another man doing the same but who initially discovered the housing market being propped up by smoke and mirrors.If you are looking for a straight-forward, ultra-dramatic treatise on the subject, you've come to the wrong place. As I mentioned, McKay just doesn't do things that way. Instead, you'll find characters breaking the fourth wall (turning to talk to the audience), dance breaks, freeze-frames, celebrity cameos, and all other manners of craziness. Instead of being distracting, though, these interludes instead always serve to illustrate a particular point. This is still a comprehensive tale of the housing collapse, but just without the rigidity or serious nature usually reserved for such ""event biopics"", if you will.What really helps pull off McKay's vision is the incredible cast, led by Gosling, Bale, and Carell. Those three alone are enough to carry the weight, but even the supporting players provide interesting character opportunities. Add in the humor, music, and genre-defying format that McKay presents, and there's a lot of reasons to get sucked into the proceedings.Perhaps most impressive, however, is that this film will leave you with a lot to think about in terms of who were the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" in the entire scenario. Things are far from black-and-white in this case, and McKay does a great job of portraying those tensions. Even the characters (like Bale's) set up as ""heroes"" to begin with only do so by exploiting the very market they inevitably save (albeit through near-total economic collapse).Overall, ""The Big Short"" is an excellent film that successfully recounts a real-life story in a supremely entertaining fashion without being too serious or too over-the-top (though it does come close on that latter front a few times!). This is probably even better than the more recent McKay project ""Vice"", as nothing feels quite so personal here. If you want the sub-prime montage scandal explained to you in a quasi-understandable way while at the same time being entertained in nearly every scene, ""The Big Short"" is the film for you."

" Stands tall as a tale of betting against the odds
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,7,"CDOs. Margins. AAA bonds. Finance doesn't usually present itself well on the big screen, unless there's a major dramatic angle to it. In Adam McKay's cleverly titled 'The Big Short,' we see the slow buildup to the 2008 housing market crisis, which we all know set off a global chain reaction of economic turmoil.At the center of it all is a band of renegade hedge fund managers and their network - from the eccentric Mark Baum (Steve Carell) to the seemingly reckless Michael Burry (Christian Bale) to the pompous, stereotypical Deutsche Bank prick (Ryan Gosling). It takes a little bit of crazy to bet against the American economy, but this crew somehow can see the forest through the trees.Aside from the remarkable true story, 'Short' is filmed in a way that it's almost a dark comedy. Interspersed with bits in which celebrities ""educate"" viewers about market dynamics (whether it's Margot Robbie or Selena Gomez or the late Anthony Bourdain), the film is not afraid to be different, including multiple instances where actors break the fourth wall to react to the narration. All of this together results in an incredibly unique, smart film that earned its best picture nomination in 2015.Regardless of the way the chips fell in real life, 'The Big Short' stands tall as a commentary on the unchecked wall street greed that resulted in one of the biggest moments in history from the last 20 years."

" Absolute gem of a film
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,The writers of this film are absolutely brilliant and I am sending the warmest of thoughts their way. This film provided an absolutely fantastic viewing experience to my father and I. We were spellbound by the absolute control the film took over our minds. This film offers an intense intellectual stimulation and understanding of events that are are so essential to understand and so supposedly banal that no one bothers to. The greatest victory of this film is finding the nerve that lets the viewer empathize with and be enthralled by what is supposed to be strictly confined to esoteric books and discussions about finance.
" Interesting approach on how the financial world is moving
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,7,"I've watched this documentary kind of movie twice and both of the times i tried hard to keep up with all the information. It will for sure make u think how economies are moving, but if u are not an economy expert u will feel dumb for not fully understanding it,even though its supposed to be understood by the average viewer. The dialogues/monologues are so fast and theres so much information that makes the movie just a tryhard-to-be-smart movie and not one that will actually educate the viewer. Even though its interesting and we all want to understand the crisis we went (are going) through better, the movie isnt as helpful. But there are some points you will understand and maybe something will be learnt out of it. I rate it high because its a movie that should be made and the cast is good, but its not well executed to earn more stars from me. Less unnecessary talking and slower dialogues would have make it much better. I recommend it either way."
" Gets Better On Each Rewatch
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,9,"Most of you reading this review remember the last time the U.S. had a downturn in it's economy - it was 2008 and the downturn was caused by a bubble that burst in the housing market. Michael Lewis' (author of MONEYBALL) book THE BIG SHORT attempted to explain what happend in lay man's terms. This books was considered ""unfilmable"" until the most unlikeliest of artists stepped in to make a wonderfully crafted and educational film that was also entertaining.That person was Adam McKay - up until that time, known as the Director of such Will Ferrell films as STEP BROTHERS and ANCHORMAN.Set in the timeframe right before - and during - the economic downturn (approx. 2006-2008), THE BIG SHORT follows 4 groups/individuals that begin to see that something is wrong - both with this seemingly ""bullet proof"" housing market and the institutions/regulations and governance around them.Christian Bale is outstanding (and was nominated for an Oscar) for his work as Dr. Michael Burry a socially awkward genius who is the first to ferret out that something is wrong and ""bets against the market"". Bale's portrayal of a non-social (almost) recluse who speaks his mind is engaging and fascinating to watch. It was with this performance that I decided that Bale is, perhaps, the finest actor working today. Also stepping up his game - as a surprise to me - is Ryan Gosling as the narrator of this story. He has the right balance of charm and ""smarminess"" and often breaks the 4th wall to explain to us what is going on. Also on board, strongly, is Brad Pitt (one of the Producers of this film) as an ex-Wall Street maverick who is pulled back in by the opportunity this impending crash is creating.But, the surprise to me in this film is the heart-breaking, gut-wrenching turn of Steve Carrell as Wall Street broker Mark Baum who's caustic personality hides some serious scars underneath and who takes the failures of ""the system"" to protect the people personally. Carrell was nominated for an Oscar the year before in his first major dramatic turn - FOXCATCHER - but I think his work here is stronger, more layered and nuanced and (if there is a hero in this story) had you rooting for this guy throughout the film.But...none of this would have worked if McKay didn't figure out a way to make the boring-ness and tedium of explaining the housing financial system (tranches, CDO's, default swaps, etc) in such a way that educates and entertains the audience - and find a way he did. By pulling celebrities like Anthony Bordain, Selena Gomez and Margot Robbie in to break the 4th wall and explain extremely dry subject matter in such a way as to make it understandable and enjoyable, he makes this film succeed.And, succeed it does, as it's 5 Oscar nominations (including Best Picture, Best Director and the aforementioned Best Supporting Actor nomination for Bale - a nomination that I would have been happy had Carrell gotten) would attest to - it did win the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay (for McKay and Charles Randolph).This is a film that gets better for me on each rewatch, for I understand just a little more. If this is your 1st time watch - or your 10th - check out the BIG SHORT, it will be worth your time.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
" The Big Short
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"The Big Short""The Big Short"", written and directed by Adam McKay, depicts the true story of the 2008 Great Recession, also known as the ""Subprime Mortgage Crisis"". Going into the film, I hadn't expected it to be anything intellectual. I mean, it was written by the same guy that created ""Stepbrothers"", ""Talledega Nights"", ""Anchorman"", etc. However, ""The Big Short"" is surprisingly a cohesive, informative film with tons of entertaining moments and techniques.Originally, in 2006, the crisis occurred due to the mortgage rates plummeting. Many subprime homeowners with high interest rates received loans that were improperly dismissed / ignored by the banks. In turn, many of the corrupted insurance groups bought stocks / maintained CDO's assuming they'd be making great business, but instead lost revenue which essentially created the recession. Only a select few noticed this inevitable crash (Burry, Baum, Geller, Shipley, etc) and decided to short (bet against) the mortgage bonds, causing heads to turn and patronize them. The ending left me disappointed but not surprised. It was a solid message / reality check at how corrupt the system is and how there's nothing we can do about it. I'm not heavily invested into politics but the implications of greed and capitalism were clear.The Big Short, in my opinion, uses unconventional, yet engaging characters and storytelling very well. Christian Bale and Steve Carrell are highly convincing ""outcasts"", as well as exceptional performances from Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, and the remaining cast. I also really enjoyed the 4th wall breaks between prominent characters, as well as guest appearances from Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdain.The camera techniques were probably my favorite aspect to the film. The pan shots, snap-zooms and steadicam shots are identical to shows like ""The Office"", ""Parks and Recreation"", ""Modern Family"", etc. In this sense, ""The Big Short"" manages to engage the audience in a relatively educational biopic.The Big Short, to me, is another great biopic that depicts a socioeconomic / financial crash caused by the corrupted system. The film remains grounded and easy to comprehend for simpletons like me. Many will say it's too corny / unorthodox, but I believe the screenwriting benefits the atmosphere/ subject matter well.7/10"

And hidden under the funny surface is a deep sorrow, which shows the fact that ordinary people pay for everything and the wicked disappear."
" Almost perfectly done.
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Amazing movie. Entertaining and educational at the same time. Every American should see this film. It was marketed as a comedy, but in fact it is a very intense drama, extremely well written, acted, and directed."
" Clichés overload at times but a well-executed film nevertheless
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,7,"""The Big Short"" has an unsexy plot, the banking crisis of 2008. Directed by Adam McKay and based on the book of the same name plus the subtitle ""Inside the Doomsday Machine"", we follow different people in the business with one very particular thing in common: they foresee the coming crisis. Christian Bale as the Asperger-like heavy metal fan of a hedge fund operator Michael Burry, and Steve Carrell as the fumingly unstable and neurotic Mark Baum are arguably the main stars of this financial drama. They do get some very nice support from others such as Brad Pitt disguised in a beard, a black haired Ryan Gosling, and a soft-spoken Marisa Tomei. The whole cast does a great job, and each character is distinguishable from the others, making no one in the ensemble feel excessive. ""The Big Short"" moves fast and if you stop paying attention for a short moment, it'll be hard keeping up with the rest of the plot. Using business terms, it's crucial to always stay focused, meaning it's not one of those lay back and enjoy kind of movies. Overall, it is a well-written movie, but the New Yorker top of the chain business men cliches are somewhat tiresome. The way the characters talk have been seen numerous times on film before and ""The Bit Short"" could benefit from using another type of language or attitude at times. Finally, a shout out should be made to John Magaro and Finn Wittrock playing the aspiring duo behind the Brownfield Fund who teams up with Brad Pitt's character. These three should definitely have had more screen time as their storyline is the most enjoyable in this big banking thriller."
" Excellent movie
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,8,I don't get the cinematography angel the camera is always moving extreme close up blurred images it is just annoying to the eye will not let you focus. Maybe it looks cool to some people or it is a way to portray the fragility of the housing market? I did not enjoy it.
" Fake Woke Garbage Storytelling
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,2,"This movie is incredibly inaccurate.It was not Wall Street that ruined up the housing market with these loans, it was The Federal Reserve and the US government. The Clintons, Bush & Obama.And NO ONE blamed the burst of the housing bubble on immigrants or poor people like this movie is trying to force down your throat. No one blamed them.
People blamed the banks and Wall Street.The acting is fantastic. That gets the movie a 2.This movie is just more Hollywood propaganda to protect the guilty."
" A must see, totally horrifiying
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,This film and the miniseries Chenobyl are the most scary titles I have ever seen.

" Brilliant film exposing US corruption.
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,"Capitalism breeds greed, inequality, corruption, loss, and failure. This film exemplifies what is wrong with this country! Watch this and understand it."
" Sort of interesting, but falls flat on its face.
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,6,"This was worth watching, but at points is rather painful to get through. I thought the actors and actresses chosen, and their portrayals, are the let down. In the style of Family Guy, there are many sub-scenes within a scene giving context. However, the scene with Margo Robbie in a hot tub explaining things seemed exploitative and forced rather than trendy, which is what they were aiming for. Of course, this is Hollywood, so they try to give you only half the explanation for what happened. I mean, as a biopic, it does OK, but not every minor detail is 100%. But in Hollywood, they try the little guy vs evil, greedy businessman routine, which got old. Steve Carell falls flat, as does Ryan Gosling. They're all kind of robotic. Brad Pitt's brief role is always welcome. The problem is, you will compare this in your mind to much better movies of a similar style. It has the feel of a grade-school video lecture. I don't understand why I'm always at odds with the critics, but that's my take. I can't quite call it a full-blown schmooze-fest movie."
" It was fine
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,7,It was fine. A little too long. Fun interjects with the music. Like the shake your money maker song. Loved seeing Anthony Bourdain.

" A broken system.
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Standing somewhere on the edges of ""documentary"" is this very unique film.
At first, this film comes off as a bit of a comedic ""heist"" film that plays off of the stupidity of the financial system. Then, when it strikes you that this really happened, and nothing was fixed by it, and the only outcome could be the collapse of the housing industry, you start to get angry.
You get mad, and frustrated, and scared that this whole thing could happen again and there's nothing you can do about it."
" What the movie left out
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,5,"I kept waiting for the film to point out the main culprit behind the financial crisis, which was not Wall Street ""greed"" but bad monetary and credit policies from the Federal Reserve and the federal government. The Community Reinvestment Act forced banks to make loans to people who couldn't afford it...but you never hear this, and you're certainly not going to hear it from the famously anti-business. Hollywood."

Watch it!"
" Entertained and Confused
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,8,"A rather enjoyable look at the depressing truth of the financial crisis of this century. This is a well threaded film with a horrible truth, a lot of people are greedy and don't care about the consequences of there actions. Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling and Steve Carroll give great performances, and Christian Bale was nominated several times for supporting actor. But the real talent lies in the adapted screenplay. Nominated several times and winner at the BAFTA's and Oscars. It's not surprising either. I'll admit, I still don't understand a lot of what they were going on about, but thanks to the screenplay, I have a vague knowledge and can compare it to Fish Stew a game of Blackjack and a bubble bath with Margot Robbie."
" Very entertaining
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,8,Director Adam McKay gets the depressing message across in a very entertaining way. Brilliant cast.
" Waste of time
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,3,"I feel like I've wasted 2 precious hours of my life watching this movie. Don't get me wrong: The topic is quite interesting. However, it could've been made much more simpler in order to be understood by more people. Definitely, there were some positives, as well. E.g. good acting and... I guess that's it.
Now, just to make myself clear: There are people who're gonna like this movie. I am not just one of them."

" Hilarious reviews here with people actually believing this happened
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,1,"Most reviews rave about the accuracy of this film. The saddest thing about our country is how terrible our schools and media are now. Yes, this is a truly great film from a story and acting standpoint, but it is fiction and propaganda.If you want the real story read nysalesman's 3 star review ""Short on Truth."" Blame the Clintons, Bush, and Obama for high crimes against us all. The banks and corporations will always try to make money as each of us does in our own way to survive. But in this case the banks were forced to lend to anybody who wanted a house no matter how bad their credit or employment history, as long as they were part of a minority. If lenders did not fund every loan there were huge fines to pay, not to mention total government takeover. Many other things were done by Congress to make this happen but basically no one ever paid the price besides us. Bush added 5 trillion to the debt and Obama 10 just printing money and borrowing from China to pay for it.I have been researching Hollywood historical pics made during the past 40 years. Never believe a biopic or historical drama unless you have already done thorough research yourself. They are always lying; propagandizing, and convincing who to hate. They stoke emotions for their agenda and make up facts. Don't forget who caused the Great Depression: Congress and the Fed, not Wall Street."
" Best biographical drama

A required viewing for all adults, not only for the ones who can think their fortunes may be on Wall Street.
And after that go watch Margin Call with Kevin Spacey."
" The Big Short (2015)
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,9,"Directed by Adam McKay. Starring Steve Carell, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Jeremy Strong, Hamish Linklater, John Magaro, Finn Wittrock, Brad Pitt, Rafe Spall, Byron Mann, Adepero Oduye, Melissa Leo, Tracy Letts, Marisa Tomei, Jeffry Griffin. (R)Dramatized but mostly accurate account of several disparate investors that recognize a devastatingly flawed housing bubble and bet heavily against the mortgage market in the years leading up to the 2008 collapse. As much a real-world horror film as a savage comedy, the filmmakers pinpoint the corruption and hammer it home, making cynical sense out of a cynically insensible series of events. Script (by McKay and Charles Randolph, based on a non-fiction book by Michael Lewis) blends lots of economics jargon and meta-humor, and pulls off the Herculean task of triggering fascination and even entertainment from long conversations about subprime mortgages and bonds and CDO's, while also making people who earn (very comfortable) livings off of the failure of others surprisingly likable, sometimes even sympathetic. (The latter is done primarily by provoking outrage toward the fat cats who knew better and didn't care.) Cast is terrific top-to-bottom, especially Carell as a fed-up trader who lacks a verbal filter; should anyone be surprised, though, that the character who comes closest to having an admirable conscience is played by Pitt, who happens to be a co-producer? Hank Corwin's sensational editing gives the film the pace of a thriller, and it certainly is terrifying at times. One gross miscalculation: thinking it would be easier for the audience to concentrate on an investment lesson if it was delivered by Margot Robbie in a bubble bath. Anthony Bourdain and a couple others also cameo as themselves.88/100"
" Confusingly enjoyable
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,6,"The Big Short is a film everyone should watch at least once in their life due to the film's attempt of tackling and watering down the rocket science of America's housing and stock market. The whole film shows the slow but lethal rise in housing mortgages which began in the 1970s and was the most dangerous during the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis.To put it simply, this film is confusing, a little too confusing, but nonetheless, still very enjoyable because of the acting and storytelling. The star of the film for me is Steve Carrell, his best acting in my opinion is put on display in this film. The Big Short was able to make the transition of Steve, the goofy man-child in The Office and The 40-year old Virgin, to his stern gritty self in Foxcatcher and The Big Short. Alongside Carrell, Bale, Gosling and Pitt deliver very good performances of their real-life counterparts..Even when the film employed star cameos such as Selena Gomez playing poker to Margot Robbie in a bathtub sipping champagne simplifying Triple-A stocks in the hopes to somehow grab our attention, we still watch the scenes with a big 'wtf' in the back of our head. Some people will not like this film for the reason that it is too much work and effort to understand on the go. I even had trouble myself understanding the context fully while watching but because of outstanding dialogue and great acting, I kept on going for the 2hr 10mim. That is the real magic of this film, showcasing an actor's ability in delivering stellar performances with a subject not familiar very well with the general consensus. It's almost as if we were there with them, in the offices, conference rooms or Wall Street itself.The Big Short is living proof that a film with great characters, acting and dialogue has more precedence over conventional plots and storylines."
" Smart and captivating
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,9,"The director got this right. That is, how to take a non-fiction book and create and absorbing movie out of it, that has a narrative? Seabiscuit and A Beautiful Mind did this by creating sentimental films that missed their books' points. I have seen this twice and want to see it again."
" Bad
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,1,Bad film.. need to be a nerd to get it. With glasses and pocket protectors.
" A great look into how corrupt the world economy are
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,8,"This movie tells about an event which i don't even remember. In 2008, i'm only 16 and studied in a hostel school makes me much more alienated from outside world issue.Thankfully this movie gives me great insight about what happened during the great recession and how far it impacted particularly in USA. Although there are many terms that would make laymen would pause for a while to grasp and fully understand it, that doesn't make it less good to watch. If you're a fan of based on true story movie, this should be on your watchlist. The story is good,the acting is good especially Steve Carell, the dialogue is good although it takes some time to understand it. If you like The Post, you'll absolutely love this movie."
" Brilliantly produced

" The Big Short
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,7,"Between this and Vice I'm starting to think I might be a big fan of Adam McKay. The way he jumps in and out of the movie, using the fourth wall breaks to tell story, sprinkling in self proclaimed false truths and intertwining it all with wit and a clear passion for the subject matter makes for uniquely entertaining pieces that may even be teaching a thing or two.The inverse is that his films so far have been entirely one sided and the Big Short definitely fits that bill. Still his ability to get great performances from people is exceptional and I'm looking forward to more"
" A Well Acted, Playful Underdog Film About Corruption on Wall Street
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,9,"The film makes very apparent its attempt to make audiences understand the often prestigious world of Wall Street. I admired the celebrity cameo explanations and graphic representations of various terms throughout the film. They both helped me follow the story and added a good bit of humor and spontaneity. But what I loved most about the film was the acting. Christian Bale, who has surely solidified his place among my favorite actors, does an amazing job as the socially inept Michael Burry. Additionally, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and the other cast of supporting actors did a great job in their roles. I felt they really captured the wrought emotion and tension of the whole situation they were coming into, and it gave the film a deep sense of realism, which intrigued me even further. ""The Big Short"" is not a film about a finance or economics, but about the stories of individuals attempting to reveal a corrupt system in a true underdog, ""Chicken Little""-like endeavor."
" The Big Short triggers a crisis of its own by treating its audience like children.
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,5,"Ladies and gentlemen, I bestow upon you the most frustrating film to ever exist in our plane of reality. You ready for more controversy? I don't like The Big Short. It is a purposefully unconventional exercise in butchering a perfectly solid film through self-obsessed patronisation. A felicitous topic that ages more flavorous than a cheap bottle of Chambord with every passing year, yet presented in the most condescending manner available. Honestly, I'm feeling my veins on my forehead right now. Adam McKay, man. Not impressed. Depicting the financial crisis of '08, three concurrent narratives demonstrate the fraudulent behaviour of banking corporations and mortgage brokers that forced the inception of the ""housing bubble"".But don't let me bore you with this drivel, here's grime legend Skepta to offer an explanation. Forget about that though. The real issue here is the packaging of subprime loans into collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) which are being rated at AAA level, guaranteeing the eventual collapse of Wall Street. Mean nothing to you? Don't worry, here's adult entertainer Farah Abraham to illustrate these technical terms as she's getting ploughed by a man twice her age. How about the frightening issue of the Securities and Exchange Commission upholding no regulations for monitoring mortgage-backed security activity. Scary, but went straight over your head right? Say no more, here's a frolicking emu to peck at the topic.Do you see the problem here? The financial crisis, and what banks are still selling today, is terrifying. Absolutely petrifying. Witnessing unemployment rates rocket whilst homes, families and actual lives are lost, disintegrating into an ever-increasing total fuelled by greed and sickening motives. It's obscene. The system is broken, and the events that preceded the tipping point are the most important years of modern history. No exaggeration. I cannot begin to overstate how deftly consequential, and omnipotent, the financial industry is. However my problem, my absolute colossal issue, is that you rarely witness the horror in The Big Short. Rarely do you experience the abhorrent fraudulent cynicism of capitalism. Why? Well, because some tool named Adam McKay would rather subject the viewers to unconventional comedy in order to make light of the impending doom.No. I'm sorry, but no. Breaking the fourth wall to explain financial concepts in the most patronising lines of dialogue possible is literal butchery. Acquiring celebrity cameos to lavishly detail, and derail, terms by utilising analogies that a primary school teacher would fully lay out to the class is insulting. Etching diagrams onto the screen, in this case a testicle because apparently we have no idea what one looks like, to evoke a needless sense of comedy is futile. These are just deterrent distractions. Obstructing the harrowing events at the centre of McKay's charades.The worst part, is that he actually does utilise the characters to explain financial jargon to each other. The Jenga construction of bond credit ratings, for example. Vennett describes the eventual collapse perfectly to the FrontPoint partners. Character to character. But of course, McKay treats us like babies and has Gosling break character only to stare into the camera and narrate our, no sorry, his thoughts and further clarify terms in case they weren't simple enough. This is even without mentioning Corwin's frenetic editing that never lets the situational horror simmer. Just constantly keeps ticking over every important emotional detail, retaining a distance from these characters. I yearn to feel Michael Burry's anguish and pressure. I wish to become enveloped in Mark Baum's disgust with American bureaucracy. The rare occasion, mostly Ben Rickert outlining the effects of the impending collapse and how innocent civilians will perish, upholds the true terror of the crisis. But it's not enough to truly denote its greater impact on America.McKay focussed too much on the excessive meta-references, naturally considering his terrible filmography of comedies, that he diverted from the heart of the ""Doomsday machine"". Glossy for the sake of being unconventional. It doesn't sit right with me. At all. What's more infuriating, is that the performances were all excellent. Bale, Carell, Gosling and even Pitt. Yet they were diluted by a purposefully satirical tone that danced around the crisis. Unforgivable. I understand why McKay took this approach. I acknowledge how many viewers can get onboard with the comedy. I get it. I just don't agree with McKay's execution in the slightest. And it's only because I'm so passionate about the subject, that The Big Short really did fall short."
" Movie was NOT for me. BUT doesn't mean it isn't for you.
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,7,"Let me just start off by saying this movie was NOT for me. I'm going to be honest, I might be a little dumb for this movie. I might need a rewatch. But I respect Adam McKay for not dumbing down the movie for anything, except for those cameos with Margot, Selena Gomez, explaining things to us. (Or maybe it was dumbed down lol). But just because I didn't understand it doesn't mean I'm going to give it a bad rating. This movie is filled with fantastic performances from the whole cast. Also the editing of this movie is what honestly made me keep watching. Some people might find it annoying but I thought it was terrific editing. Overall, this movie has a good true story, filled with amazing performances, and amazing editing. But this movie isn't for everyone. Just keep that in mind."
" This is as good as it gets ! Where's the 10 +

" Breaking the fourth wall just by staring at it
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,9,"writing with powerfull dark humour. People who are unfamiliar with finance will also enjoy it since the movie explains the simple mechanism of the so called ""complex derivative products"" which are in fact just fancy names given for fiddle."
" Well directed, well written and informative
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,9,"I watched this movie a second time. It explains why the 2008 crisis happened. It achieves this by great story-telling technique, good directing and great acting. It is a great piece of work cinematically. What is even better is it has something to say to its audience. It does a great job of explaining how the capitalist system works, how it is abused for higher gains and how public agencies should be protecting the tax-payer citizens, but actually they are not. And also how dumb people in general are and how they do not question most things. Great movie!"
" Can You Handle the Truth?
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,7,"In short, the truth is difficult to watch. As the film aptly puts: ""Truth is like poetry. And most people f...ing hate poetry"". This film is, more or less, the truth.What 'The Big Short' does well, among many things including casting, pacing, and humour, is reveal a version of the truth to the wider public. It penetrates the psyche of viewers in a way which conventional media cannot. It tells you that the world economy was built on an irrational lie. It prompts you to consider what you believe. It asks you to consider whether you know the truth, or simply a version of it. The Big Short does all these things, and yet its not perfect.You may be incensed that this event occurred, however this film does not provide the full impact of the Global Financial Crisis. It misses a beat in displaying the human cost. With the exception of Mark Baum (Steve Carrell), its difficult to relate to any of the leading roles. Maybe this is the point; to isolate and scapegoat the world of Wall Street. Or maybe its not. Either way, its difficult to relate with many of the stories the film represents.The Big Short undoubtedly brings the events of 2007-9 into sharp focus, and reminds audiences to consider the shady world of global finance. However, like the film clearly identifies, its not always the easiest film to watch. Does it create an effective feature? Yes. Does it do this perfectly? No. However, it remains a relevant film in the age of the global economy.And that's the truth."
" very good, worth watching again
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,9,"This is the best movie i've watched in years. Very interesting, well done."
" Simplistic Denouement
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,7,"Yes, it this movie is fast paced, fascinating characters well acted and it made a difficult subject understandable.
However the overwhelming point of view of the film makers permeated the movie. Bankers, Mortgage lenders, investment firms, and all of Wall Street are not only greedy, avaricious but really stupid to boot!
There was no balance in the film outlining other causes such as the government's role in this debacle. Starting with Bill Clinton, his administration pushed for more minority home ownership by encouraging not enforcing usual lending practices such as down payments and income to debt ratios. Next, through congressional legislation, banking businesses were encouraged to weaken or toss out normal lending practice standards and norms. In addition, most of the loans were made by private businesses and they were not subject to government regulation. Since normal practices were not used, indeed it was a bomb waiting to go off.
A statement repeated several times at the last 10 minutes of the movie that was that in the aftermath, now the usual suspects--"" the poor and the immigrants"" were going to be and were blamed.""
I really think that is a complete overstatement. There are many causes of this devastating event and many people had a part in it spanning a long period of time. This film doesn't deal with the complexity of causes at all, just states some cliche bromides and leaves it at that.
It was enthralling, moved at a good pace, had interesting characters but overall I am disappointed in the simplistic approach."

" A dramatic documentery, or a documentory-like drama?
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,7,"The Big Short is carried almost exclusively by its massive star power. When stripped down to just the story, cinematography, and artistic style of the film, it sinks quickly. Fortunately, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, and a cast of supporting actors drenched in star power are able to make this Wall Street story an interesting one. The 4th-wall breaks also help to keep it fresh."

" The Big Short: Witty, Entertaining, Educative
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,9,"McKay approaches this adaptation of Michael Lewis' book with wit, energy and a surprising degree of clarity. But if the movie is a crackerjack entertainment, it's one with a conscience.
""The Big Short"" will affirm your deepest cynicism about Wall Street while simultaneously restoring your faith in Hollywood. In many ways the movie is a startlingly ambitious film, is modest about what it can do. It offers no solutions, and no comfort. The best it can do is put down a marker. A must watch"

" Great movie!
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,10,"Excellent movie! The actors, screenplay, direction, everything is superb in this movie! I really liked it and it's very informative indeed!! After watching this movie is was clearer how all this fraud was thought and designed by these men from Wall Street. And the sad thing is that it happens exactly the same in all countries, the poorest are the ones that pay for all the corruption of the more rich people! Really very very sad!"
" Interesting, and scary.
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,8,"Directed by Adam McKay, this is one of the best movies of the year. It is about the financial crisis of 2007 and 08, a topic I have virtually no interest in. Also, I am someone who doesn't financial terms. The movie knows this, and it had a very creative way of explaining the audience what they don't understand. I will also say this, it had some ingenious celebrity cameos.
The cast of the movie is great. Steve Carrell and Christian Bale do most of the heavy lifting. Ryan Gosling, amazing as always, is the funny one. Brad Pitt, in the limited screen time that he is given,
Eaves a lasting impression.
The movie is also good in the way that it forces you to keep up. If you zone out, you'll probably miss out on details. In some places, the movie is intentionally frantically edited and directed to give us a documentary like feel. This is a great movie. For people who love a good screenplay, or good acting, or good humor, this should be a treat.
4 out of 5 for me."
" Impressive
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,6,"Here's a case of people that took a topic that had no business being a movie. The concept is too complex and boring.

" Educational masterpiece: This film worth everyone to sit and pay their 100% attention for 2 hours to watch it and learn from the film.

At the same time, education you perfectly, clearly, and understandable about all the economy knowledge. It is quite cute that they plug some short scenes to explain economy theory by some celebrities.The speech by Mark Baum during the film. I felt like the speech is the coral and the high pike of the entire film. It states out the ugliness of humanity, and it is still a shame that human being is still the same after years with load of greedy. Bad people is always more than good people. Unethical people is still doing things that is harm for the people, took always their kindness and trust, and even harm for the Mother Earth with all the climate change crisis. Anyway, that's going too far, but everything is connected. Water is another event that has high attention to investigate today."
" Complex but worth the watch
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Most people have a rough idea of what caused the housing crash in 07/08......greed! What this film does is give you the detail as to how money was made and lost. It's got a good cast and I was surprised to see Brad Pitt pop up in the way he did. Christine Bale is excellent as the super intelligent ""I don't fit into society"" character. Overall it's a good film that's quirky in parts. It's slightly overly complex at times, but I guess that adds to the authenticity of the characters and the way these people think. Definitely worth the couple of hours it takes to watch and digest. Just have something simple to watch after or the day after because your brain may hurt a bit trying to figure out how the financial markets work!!!!"
" I'm not smart enough to fully understand it.
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,7,"I appreciate that The Big Short tries to dumb down the housing crisis of 2008, but, apparently, I'm still not smart enough to fully understand it. A lot of this movie went over my head, but I grasped the generalities and it kept me entertained, so I applaud it for that. This film also featured some great performances by the cast, who lose themselves in their respective roles. This movie is a downer, but it's an educational downer."
" Too big to fail
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,10,"The Big Short is simply an outstanding film. I wanted to go to the top of a cliff and shout that good intelligent films were still being made. The trouble is it is a long drive for me before I can get to a nice cliff.I remember talking to my business bank manager in 2004 and telling him that there were people who were buying houses that had risen in value by over 300% in the last few years. These people were getting mortgages to buy these houses and their wages had not gone up by anything like 300%. The multiples for the wages/mortgage ratio did not add up.The bank manager who worked for his bank for decades since he left college told me not to worry. There would be no housing crash as they had learned the lesson of the early 1990s when the housing market last overheated. He was right, this time it was different, his bank went bust and had to bailed out. He still would not admit to his bank's stupidity or negligence.What should be a snoozefest about the financial meltdown of 2007/08 due to bad mortgage lending is made exhilarating and informative because the filmmakers use celebrities to coherently explain the financial concepts at the centre of this film.The star studded cast includes three Oscar winners. Dr Michael Burry (Christian Bale) is a hedge fund manager at Scion Capital. A qualified doctor who likes to drum to loud music, he doesn't like wearing shoes, is socially awkward and he has a glass eye. Burry discovers that the housing mortgage market is riddled with bad loans and bets against it. His action scares his own investors.Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) is the narrator of this film. He admits he is not altruistic, he did it for the money. He is an investment banker who learned of Burry's bet against the housing market. Vennett also thinks that the subprime mortgage market is vulnerable.Vennett also wants to bet against the market and persuades Mark Baum (Steve Carell) another socially awkward investor with a strong moral ethic. Baum and his team travel around to see if there is any truth that the subprime mortgage market could fail. They talk to mortgage brokers, people who have taken out loans, people who work in the ratings agencies, dealers that slice and dice the risky bonds full of bad debt. Baum is appalled with what he finds out.Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley are two small time investors trying to break into the big time who stumble on Vennett's proposals. They too think that Vennett's ideas have substance. However as they are small league they need the help of their neighbour Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) a retired investment bankers for the big banks. Rickert felt the whole financial system was wrong and heading for a fall.You can view these guys as mavericks, weirdos or even losers. Once they bet against the mortgage market they have a vested interest. They need the banks to fail or else they will lose money.What they find is that whole system was run by people who had no clue what they were doing, the market was rigged, worse corrupt and they would likely to be bailed out at the end. While the going was good they earned money in commissions and there was plenty of that flowing.The Big Short was directed and co-written by Adam McKay who is better known comedies. McKay won an Oscar for Best Screenplay. He just about contains his anger as to what happened and the price ordinary people paid after the collapse. He lets his film do the talking and there is no need for him to do a polemic. McKay adds comedy to an already intelligent film."
" No-one expects the global recession.
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,7,"Monty Python famously said 'no-one expects the Spanish inquistion.' And no-one expects a major recession either, or else they'd take action to avoid it. The global economic crisis that struck in 2008 came from a sudden collapse in the housing market, and from the financial products that the banks had created that were essentially a bet on this not happening. Only a few people had predicted it would all end in tears. And Michael Lewis' book, 'The Big Short', here made into a film by Adam McKay, tells the story of those few. What makes the narrative appealing (regardless of how complete a truth it is) is that the few were misfits and outsiders, people denied entry to the club of deluded money market insiders. But the film, though entertaining, is only partially succesful. The explanation of how and why things happened is superficial, while the viewer is essentially being asked to root for one group of wealthy investment managers over another. Some of them denounce the essentially fraudulent nature of the major players, but their personal goals are primarily to get rich themselves by exploiting their discovery. They're also mostly obnoxious, and I'm not so certain that being smart, and right, is enough to make you a hero. As a film, I prefered 'Margin Call', a sympathetic look at the lions of Wall Street laid low by the crash, to this more hostile treatment, even if they did all belong in jail."
" A pretty well done biography film before the 2008 crash
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,8,"I gotta say kudos to Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Steve Carrell and Ryan Gosling for being in this full of tension film. It really shows what happened in the business world before 2008 and how it was involving a lot of corruption. It's very similar to Ireland with regards to the Celtic Tiger and our head bankers/our government being such crooks without justice being served.Very educational and scarily real, I give this movie a 8/10!"
" A fascinating, exhilirating look at the GFC
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed this. It's a great story, and they told it well. I liked the straight to camera stuff, the celebrity expositions of some of the financial details like CDOs were good, the analogies were insightful. I have a little understanding of the subject matter due to reading around the subject since the GFC (I've not read the book though), and I didn't have any trouble following the ins and outs of the storyI don't know if any of the real life characters would object to their portrayals, but I liked all the performances. This story has a bit of an epic sweep to it and many more characters in it than you'd usually find in a film, they did well to bring them to life and differentiate them.Steve Carrell continues to impress in dramatic roles and there weren't any bad performances. It's paced well, the story moves along briskly. In fact, I could have stood for a bit more time being spent on some of the financial details, but I think that I'm in a minority there ;-)9/10 I'll watch this again."

" Solid
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,8,"I see that some of the main criticisms of The Big Short seem to be people finding its tone way to explanatory, and hence condescending to audiences who should already know how the financial crisis panned out. Personally, I disagree with this opinion; if what it takes is Margot Robbie in a bath tub to explain mortgage bonds to the people, then its better than having your audience who are uneducated on it uninformed, and as a result, bored. Oh yea and the film is good, lots of fun and solid preformances from the cast. 8/10Viewed 23/09/2018"
" Betting against corruption
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,8,"'The Big Short' fascinated me into seeing it without hesitation, had always wanted to see it but it took me a while to get a chance to do so. Have a lot of respect for any film that takes on complex serious subjects that absolutely should be portrayed and the talented cast. While the awards attention (particularly for the script) and critical acclaim (almost universal) interested me further. Plus it looked good. Good 'The Big Short' indeed was. Very good in fact and while it was not quite perfect it is deserving of the acclaim it got and still gets. Not quite one of the best films of the year for me but very close, with the good things being many and being exceptional in quality. 'The Big Short' took on a subject that needed to be told and holds relevance today and found myself admiring how it approached it while also making something of very high quality as an overall film.Structurally, 'The Big Short' can get a little complicated and not always easy to follow. Never incoherent as such, just sometimes not always as clear as it could have been.It definitely would have benefitted from doing less than it did, perhaps not having as much going on and having less characters.However, 'The Big Short' is well-made with mostly slick photography, despite the odd shakiness that distracts a little, and a fine eye for detail. Furthermore it is smartly directed, keeping things involving throughout the over two hour length, paced in a way that it doesn't feel that long and one is not feeling the seconds.All the cast are terrific and embody their characters instead of just playing them. Christian Bale's confident quirky performance rightly garnered him an Oscar nomination and Ryan Gosling has one of the film's more challenging roles and essential to anchoring it and he is suitably despicable, not a side we see much from him and it was both interesting and slightly unsettling to watch. Steve Carrell plays it straight while still adopting a jokiness that doesn't feel out of place, he is fun to watch while showing an anger and torment that makes him moving. Brad Pitt does well too and the cameos don't jar or bog things down.The script is one of the reasons why 'The Big Short' works as well as it does and deserved its Oscar win. It does a great job entertaining and informing and doing it in a way that's taut, smart and making one feel the right emotions. Even though there are issues with the structure, the story is still incredibly compelling, with the interconnecting subplots being involving and developing the compellingly real characters well, and have a lot of admiration for its handling of the subject. It's a very serious, brave subject and not an easy one to bring to film but a subject that's a relevant and important one to tell, 'The Big Short' does remarkably in this aspect. It's always engaging, and it is also funny and informative while also making me feel shocked, angry and emotional as the events unfolded.Overall, very good with many wonderful things. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
" Highly successful, stylish biographical drama.
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,8,"Like Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, The Big Short is another darkly comic biographical drama examining the morally bleak world of Wall Street. Whilst The Wolf revels in narcissism and vanity, The Big Short weaves moral ambitions into its story, which is told through the eyes of a number of investors who seek to exploit the 2008 US economic crisis. Outside of sharing a rather niche genre, other stark parallels include; utilising a narrator, a rapid editing style and delivering an exceedingly well made film. The Big Short may not reach the extravagant heights of The Wolf, however it succeeds more than amply on its own merits. Christian Bale's portrayal of socially incompetent investor Michael Burry transcends the rest of the cast and cements Bale as one of the most versatile actors today."
" Accuracy and honesty
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,8,"It is rare that modern American movie making is both accurate and honest. This movie is.
To be clear: it is a movie ... with a written script; well acted and the story remains fairly clear throughout.
The descriptions of the relevant financial products are concise yet educational. 
The premise of adding complexity in Finance to obscure both reality and value are correct.
I thoroughly recommend this movie to all. It is both historically educational and rewarding as a film in its own right."
" A bit of a mess
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,7,"The Big Short cannot be dedined as a bad film. It is funny, interesting and in general a very good satire of the high life in America. The film also boasts a massive cast, all of whom do well, in particular Steve Carell and Christain Bale.However, the film tries to do too much for a single film. There are too many characters, organisations and terms to keep up with and as a result the film becomes very confusing. The celebrity cameos work very well in explaining certain terms. Unfortunately there are only three of these in the entire film. Its also a classic case of style over substance. The film tries to give off a modern, cool feeling which does not apeal to all viewers. The final result feels more like a sketch show about a few flashy Americans with a plot so complex that it tends to alienate the viewers and failing to actually inform, which is what most viewers want from this film."
" Enjoyable
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,7,"Confusing? Absolutelty so but fantastically handled by the powers that be in smartly 'dumbing down' the many confusing concepts that are tackled head on. A well crafted film and impressive the story is also quite interesting to watch, with good characters and fantastic performances from an all star cast. Good watch"
" Entertaining and Informative
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,9,"This movie felt like a blend of a film and documentary. It has a great narration by Ryan Gosling. Great acting too. The movie is made in such a way that the information reaches to all. All jargons explained and simplified in a very original way I must say - through 'real' celebrities in the movie - so that it is appealing to most of the viewers. It was very original in my opinion.Steve Carell is as always very good. And he is especially very good in his character. I loved his character and one could see him delivering the pain and emotions very sincerely towards the end of the movie. Christian Bale made me do a double take when his character came on screen. I mean, I know he has two fully functional eyes then how did he pull this off? How? It was incredible. This I think was an exceptional piece of acting. This is the definition of living the character in the movie. As far as direction is considered, it was very good. Not very unique because some elements I think is borrowed from Woody Allen where he makes the characters talk to us through the screen but the effect and timing is really nice. I have seen 'The Other Guys' by Adams and I found that entertaining too. More than the other I believe. And I found this movie thoroughly entertaining too."
" Rather over-rated
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,6,"Mixing fact with fiction, the months that precede the financial disaster of 2008 is chronicled in a satirical way. Various financial players who are able to foresee the outcome end up betting against the U.S. economy for their personal gain. Some of them include an eccentric (Christian Bale), a bully (Ryan Gosling), and two others who have not fully lost their sense of morality (Steve Carell and Brad Pitt).While this event affected (and continues to affect) many lives quite deeply, there remains a challenge in explaining the beastly details to average moviegoers with a minimal knowledge of economics. For the most part, it helped to have players occasionally speaking to the camera to explain in laymen's terms regarding what is happening. This helps a great deal but the movie's length does not. There are many scenes of economic types in deep conversation. Some of these scenes are great while others create and compound confusion. This is unfortunate as the subject matter is important and worthy of being filmed.There is also the challenge of dealing with an ending which the audience already knows is coming. The movie does end well with a good commentary. With fine acting and success at finding humour in tragedy (without being condescending), the film might have have had more impact with a shorter length. It was still a worthy attempt."
" Great
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,8,"This is a great drama with some elements that are actually really funny too. It's a good story, well written with good characters, and there is some top notch acting in it. Bale and Carrell are terrific."
" An intelligent and interesting, important story
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,8,"The Big Short is just a very good movie. All of the performances are very good, and of course the cast is phenomenal. I always love a well-done true story movie, and this is a fascinating story that accurately captures the unfortunate realities of finances. Direction is extremely impressive, and the weaving of characters and stories was very well handled. Would've liked to see even more from the other sides of the story, as it was primarily focused on those who bet on the short, but it's a reasonable choice to make. Very satisfying and well done, and very real."
" SAINTS DON'T LIVE ON PARK AVENUE
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,10,"This is the story of the hedge fund operators who saw the housing bubble collapse coming and profited by betting against it. We have glimpses of the personal lives and idiosyncrasies of the main characters. Michael Burry (Christian Bale) saw it two years before it happened. Mark Baum (Steve Carell) got wind of it from a wrong number and checked it out himself. There were also two men from Boulder who had figured things out separately but needed the help of Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) to pull it off.The first hurdle was that there was no mechanism to buy a short or swap against the real estate market. Michael Burry had to negotiate them and the investment companies were happy to take his money and party with it as bonds are never down graded.The film had a number of asides and documentary style interjections. It took the complex task of explaining market terms by using stars and metaphors. For instance Selena Gomez explains synthetic CDOs at a blackjack table, something that even investors didn't know existed, or at least the film portrayed it that way.Now the folks who made millions on the collapse of the world economy didn't celebrate on screen. They felt bad winning by betting against the little guy who ultimately had to pay with his job and home.The film feels partially like a documentary. When something didn't really happen ""that way"" they did an aside to let you know it is a dramatization. And sometimes they did an aside to let you know it really did happen. This film is told from a different point of view then the other films out there, told from the viewpoint of the investment companies.It was hard not to love the bold character of Steve Carell.Guide: F-bomb, brief nudity (Mark Baum had to interview a stripper/real estate owner on the job)The film conclusions point blank disagrees with the conservative line which blamed the people who took out the mortgages and not the banks. (Don't blame me, I'm just the messenger.)"
" Reality is stranger than fiction
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,9,"I am shocked.A while ago, I started getting interested in how economy works. Chomsky's 10 principles were a true wake-up call in that respect. And then this movie? Boom.Turns out what I thought I knew about the system is only the tip of the iceberg. It's a revelation to see how this mortgage obligation system works, how people take a viable product and churn out side products of side products of side products with the sole purpose of making big money. Other people suffering in their wake? Who cares.Mark's story was the one that hit me the most, because in spite of his cynicism and angry nature, he wants to believe there is still good in people. Something which was apparent in the restaurant scene.World-class movie. I learned a lot and didn't even notice! This is how you do it."
" A modern day Boiler Room
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed the stylish documentary style adopted throughout the movie, it was quite a unique angle (reminded me of Matthew Broderick in Ferris Bueller). It's similar in many ways to Boiler Room - all about greed and corruption... but of course the scale of this issue was far greater. The acting was excellent - could not fault anyone's acting. They all suited their role perfectly. It exceeded my expectations, despite a few apparent errors in the story."

" Occasionally panders but makes its subject matter interesting and even, to an extent, engaging.
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,7,"'The Big Short (2015)' takes a unique approach when trying to communicate its complex jargon and ideas - that being that it slots in celebrity cameos wherein the star straight-up tells you the definition of a specific term in the simplest way possible - and what that does is dilute the density of the piece without necessarily dumbing it down. This can occasionally seem like pandering, though, despite that it fits into the flick's overall fast-paced, free-flowing and fourth-wall nudging aesthetic. The picture commendably manages to make the somewhat dry source-material, or rather subject-matter, interesting and even, to an extent, engaging. It focuses on a set of characters that seem realistic and rounded enough to warrant our empathy when they're given the screen time to earn it. The film does become a little too unfocused and slightly cold in the long run, which prevents it from being any more investing than it is. 7/10"
" Doesn't Tell The Whole Story But Worth A Watch
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,8,"For those who lived through it, we all knew how this ended so the story really is the why did it hsppen? And there is plenty of explanation here. Except the government is almost totally left out of the story. I read somewhere Clinton's deregulation in the '90s led to the subprime crisis in 2007/08. Anyhow, well worth a watch especially for those who didn't live through it."
" Well made
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,7,"Even though it's overused, I loved the self-conscious style of the story. Financial terms that are difficult to understand for the laymen are explained by people that have nothing to do with finance. This isn't cute or funny the way it sounds, it's satirical and sad because of how absurd the whole thing was. Combined with wonderful performances, by Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Brad Pitt, the story becomes enjoyable and not as boring as the film admits the story to be in the beginning. On the other hand, I couldn't help but feel that the film was emotionally inconsistent. I am not suggesting that films of this nature should be balanced. Sure, there's always drama in satire but the dramatic scenes of the film were not enough to warrant themselves in respect with the whole. There should have been better management of these scenes so that either they are balanced, or they are so imbalanced that they become more than they seem. I haven't read the book, but the film is well-made and worth a watch."
" The best movie detailing the engineered financial collapse during Bush II
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,10,"The movie wasn't entirely accurate some average people did know that subprime mortgages, balloon mortgages (5 year balloons which proves this happened entirely on Bush II's watch), etc. were a ticking time bomb. I was one of them, in 2005 when I invested in the mortgage business specifically in an outfit called American Home Mortgage, I only invested in them because they did not engage in subprimes or other risky loan practices, but guess what while on vacation in Orlando with my family, summer 2007, I saw my position and my kids positions in American Home Mortgage disappear via a Treo phone. American Home Mortgage was the 10th largest mortgage company in the country and it was the first to go! Anyone with half a brain saw the bubble but virtually everyone I knew, including my fat redneck boss, 
hung on every word spoken by Alan Greenspan and Alan was telling everyone to stay the course and all was well. This movie shows the criminal dealings of Goldman Sachs but they got bailed out and no one went to jail. This will happen again! This country is nothing more than a criminal enterprise! Kudos to Iceland for jailing the banksters and helping out the homeowners! By the way words right out of the idiots mouth: ""We can put light where there's darkness, and hope where there's despondency in this country.

" Great film - energetic and interesting
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Based on the true story of how the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) came about from 2005-2008, 'The Big Short' tells the story really well by mixing humour, facts (delivered in an unconventional way by celebrities) and following four tenuously-linked groups who have skin in the game. Vennett (Gosling) introduces us at the start of 2005, via a unique fourth-wall-breaking monologue, placing the players on the field - I'm using this terminology, as most of the film (and Wall Street in general) can be likened to gambling. It may sound boring on the surface - a film about banking and finance - but it does a great job of explaining the terminology in simple terms, whilst not being condescending about it.The groups involved are Burry (Bale), a fund manager and prodigy of sorts, who first sees the housing bubble and notices that the big banks have been over-valuing mortgages (sub-prime). Baum (Carell) and his small company are offered the opportunity to ""short"" the banks' mortgages by Vennett. Geller (Magaro) & Shipley (Wittrock), two young entrepreneurs, who seek help from their mentor, retired Wall St mogul Rickert (Pitt) also pick up on what' happening and get in on the action. It's great to see the banks gleefully taking their money, being so cocky and greedy, only to have it all blow up in their faces two years later.I think Carell, not Bale, should have been Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor! Baum serves as the film's moral centre and calls everyone on their fraudulent behaviour. The film almost acts as a documentary when it delves down to the individual family level and makes you truly realise how little these large corporations care for other humans. The most bittersweet part is the ending - ""and then the crooks went to jail, Congress brought in reform and the fraudulent system was overhauled - just joking! They didn't go to jail, Congress was lobbied so no reform was passed and the big banks were bailed out by the taxpayers"" - funny, sad, and true. Really makes you think, but is also a well-made film with excellent acting."
" Innovative and interesting, but hardly pefect
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"If this book's charge was difficult (translate the entire financial crisis through a few compelling characters), the film's charge may have been tougher (translate the entire financial crisis into 2 hours of pop entertainment). I give the movie bonus points for innovation and acting. The complete tear down of the 4th wall was bold, and the performances by Bale and Carrell were fantastic. BUT there are downsides to the approach. In this case, Every wink wink nudge nudge moment kept me a little more distant. And the moral arc suffered as a result. It was a pop film with a conscience, but - if you want a financial crisis movie - go see Margin Call."
" awesome movie!
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,8,"Not only is this movie informative, it is super interesting. If you haven't, i recommend reading rich dad poor dad, has some similar undertones - homes should be viewed as a liability not a asset. As Americans we need to educate ourselves. Its a eye opener that had me watching closely the entire time. The cast is amazing as well. watch it, you'll thank me."
" Surprisingly funny, informative and shocking.
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,8,"If you ever wanted to understand (on a easy to follow basis) why everything went wrong in 2007 and caused the Global Financial Crisis, then this is the movie for you. Even if you aren't interested in why, this movies offers insight into a world only few of us can ever really get our heads around.Unexpectedly funny and informative, this will outline why the system was doomed to fail, all but for a small handful of people who saw what was coming and made millions from a financial disaster."
" Stupidity and corruption shown authentically
",2017-12-11 00:00:00,9,"At first, I thought this was one of those films in which the small-time heroes took the opportunity that not so many people noticed in the 2008 economic crisis and got rich. But it was not that simple, the guys who were pretty much, aholes at first, turned out to be the only ones those who cared for anything in the f**ked up Wallstreet. No one made money like they expected and simply by some turn of events, the whole corrupt and stupid system always tries to f**k up the common people and anyone who's not big enough. The cameos and the 4th wall breaking kept the narrative a fresh feeling and to a point was also educating. At the end, we see the rich get richer the poor get poorer and the guilty go free and this is a true story. Yet the blame is on immigrants and the poor. The stupidity of people is astonishing and the guy who predicted and invested in the economic crisis is investing on the water right now, that got to be taken seriously."
" Movie is too profound to be entertaining
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,4,"Humorous and funny? NOT !! I didn't laugh once. I only got a C in Economics and all the terminology of selling ""short"", CDOs and other code words, made for a dull 130 minutes. Only Steve Carell comes off as a moral, person with a conscience, worried about the bank collapse consequences. Christian Bale's character is outstandingly perceptive, while Gosling and the two from Boulder are out to get rich and they do. This tells a story similar to Wall Street and Wolf of Wall Street,but too technical to care. Obviously people got screwed,but as a movie,it makes me indifferent."
" For me this was essential viewing about the modern world, v1.00
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,10,"Search for recent films with Selena Gomez and one finds such as this. She is only in them for a minute, a disappointingly short time, but in this the appearance is okay. She plays herself trying to explain one of the mechanisms behind the 2008 USA and worldwide financial disaster, and the setting for that example is the betting games at Las Vegas.While that financial crash was happening I was too tied up by the UK Blair Witch period to be able to access news, so I only knew about the crash by prices starting to rise and supermarkets starting to move stuff around a lot, which as a way to put off supermarket customers seems effective, just I assume that it is done to advertise their stock range and to try to get more income? When UK Tory politicians blamed the crash on the previous Labour government I had no basis, other than suspicion, for questioning that.The Big Short tells me things about the recent world and communicates better than a serious technical work would have done. I needed this.'Citizenfour' (2014), does does the same about a period when I was starting to be able to access the news. It adds more detail about how the modern world works.Look to the 2017 UK world, Brexit, these both help me to understand and appreciate that, though it would need additional features to give an explanation of how the left and right have gotten tied up by their equivalents of Blair Witch.News in September 2015 of unusually high UK levels of unsecured debt due to poverty and Brexit suggesting that a financial crash might be imminent in the UK, it is The Big Short that supplies the alarm bells for that."
" A thorough and dramatic look at the financial crisis of 2008
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,9,"It's smart not because it wants to but because it needs to. Facts are thrown in to this brilliant emotional narrative with just the right angles to tell the story from. It presents the hard truth to the characters and they all take it in their own way. You're watching an event that brought down the world economy through the eyes of the people who first discovered it and their reactions are what make the movie. Steve Carell plays a well-written character with real emotion put into the performance making it his best one so far. The way the movie is told is innovative, charming and funny when it needs to. It uses the advantage of breaking the 4th wall in unexpected ways that add to the experience. The soundtrack is fitting too."
" Short changed...
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,5,"A complicated story navigated by some good actors, with the requisite Hollywood handwringing thrown in, at the end...This is a very contemporary topic that deserved to be explored in a cinematic sense... but I'm sorry, I just can't make myself care about the minutiae, no matter how hard I try... If you're au fait with the financial landscape, it's an impressive and engaging watch, though!"
" Great film with an all-star cast.
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed this film and how it portrayed the housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000. The cast were all very convincing in their roles - especially Steve Carell, of which I'm used to seeing him in funny roles, did a great job in the serious portrayal of his character.I felt the film was a little long, and some parts should have been edited out, but overall an entertaining and informative film.It's a 9/10 from me!"
" Gives some understanding.
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,8,"Want to know what a:Sub-Prime Mortgage Mortgage Bond Credit Default Swap Collateralized debt obligation Synthetic Collateralized debt obligationare?Didn't think so. But this fascinating movie shows how three different fund managers of varying levels of experience realized as early as 2005 that the housing market was a bubble about to burst and set out to profit from it when it did. As 2007 rolled into 2008 and people began to default on their mortgages - the fund managers begin to realize that they have actually bet on the economy failing and that this will lead to millions losing homes, jobs and savings.The three funds ultimately made $2.5 BILLION but it was a drop in the bucket compared to the $5 TRILLION wiped out the economy.Cleverly told by observation, characters talking directly to camera in plain English and short blocks of text - the movie recreates the heady days of 2005-7 and the eventual failure of the big banks. A far clearer understanding of what really happened emerges.A surprisingly good movie from what threatened to be a dry subject."
" 4 ""W473r Bubbl3"" 1s N3x7.
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,7,"I would've given The Big Short an 8/10 if I just understood it better. I definitely get its premise and focus, and the ultimate plot, but I don't quite grasp the mechanics of the situation. This is in no way the film's fault, this one is purely on me.For instance, when the movie ended, Michael Burry went to his board and wrote; +489%. I thought what had happened was, even though Burry was right, sadly because of the Bank Institutions Fraud, his $1.3 Billion investment dwindled to $489 Million (there is an email he sends), in a scrabble to sell off Swaps he purchased, thus perhaps dropping the value of the Hedge Fund to around -55%, especially since the Fund just kept losing more and more value due to the payments Burry had to make to those banks. But then underneath, was the $2.69 Billion total profit. So, is he closing down the Fund because the business murders ones soul or is he leaving because he lost, though cheated. There were many other points that maybe were a bit much for me to grasp, however, that is a plus for me with this particular film; it got me so invested, I wanted to understand every bit of it.The Big Short is, the type of eye opener that makes one wonder if maybe, this is now finally being exposed, as a strategy to hiding an even bigger agenda. Get us to focus on something that happened so many years ago, to get our eyes off what's starting to happen now. In a nutshell, The Big Short awakens paranoia. Is that a good thing? As a film, definitely.Christian Bale just blew me away. I loved Gosling, Pitt, Carell and even Magaro and Wittrock, but Bale, was amazing. Honestly, Carell too was amazing. The writing, the story, the directing, absolutely stunning. All this time (prior to watching the movie) I thought the main characters are all in this together, just to find that they're not... But, they are.""They knew. They knew the taxpayer would bail them out. They weren't stupid, they just didn't care"". That is just too, too profound. It's not a script. It's not fiction. This, actually, happened, in the very reality in which we exist.This film is possibly an 8 and above out of ten, but, there were parts that I didn't understand, again, not because the film fell short, but rather because my knowledge lacked. So, 7.5/10.P.S. Michael continues to flex his ability to foresee impending doom. A water crisis is not a movie anymore, it's happening, it's now. To me, to you, IMDb, United States to South Africa, from Paramount to all of us. Burry is not wrong... He is a genius. Ben Rickert too, is on to something."
" Storytelling at its most effective
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,10,"As an aspiring student of finance and obviously one of the many who believes the world is run by corporations and governments colluding, this movie was the perfect entertainment that brought in bouts of humour with cameos and dramatisation when required, the end asking questions in an unfunny way but complemented by a satirical note after.What's not to like? Chrisitian Bale is just too f***ing good (excuse my French) in his role as the nerdy broker whose meticulousness is well complemented by his non-exuberant non wall street demeanour. Ryan Gosling is convincing as the plagiariser who knew what to do with the golden nugget of info. Steve Carell is probably right after Bale, if we choose to rank performance, that is. His rather unusual role as the uncaped crusader of wall street is interesting, and probably the most unlikely character but nonetheless one of the most pivotal ones as well. Brad Pitt was short and effective, and unremarkable, which is exactly what the story required.But, again, the cameos. I don't really care if the top critics have a distaste for such stunts, but they were such a welcome footnote in bringing in some lightness to the convoluted jargon of finance. They were the garnish that's just makes the meal flavourful and a sight to behold.And as a music lover, the end theme was right on the money.Although, I have to admit, the amount of s**te that year produced, I believe my praise is kind of biased. The big short allowed me to believe in Hollywood again."
" My Current Favourite Movie
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,10,"This movie is so in depth and really shows the different perspectives of people in the 2008 financial crisis. It opened my eyes to the business world and truly interested me in its past and where it will head in the future. The story is lovely combining money,love and drama all in one, with some hilarious comedy perfectly placed throughout the movie. Great family movie (if you have older children) but generally easy to understand. Amazing movie. My favourite soundtrack also great job on that."
" A Joke with a Serious Crisis
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,5,"In the end of 2007, the world saw one of the greatest crisis in the United States of America, the real estate bubble that affected and devastated the American economy. ""The Big Short"" is a comedy that plays with the housing mortgage fraud of the bank and some of the players that foresaw the housing bubble and started hedge funds to make money. The screenplay is confused for those that are not familiar with details of the financial concepts and investments. The cameo appearance of personalities explaining concepts does not work well. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""A Grande Aposta"" (""The Big Bet"")"
" ""They're not admitting, they're bragging""
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"The housing collapse of the mid 2000's affected just about everybody in many humanistic ways. The loss of jobs, homes, retirement, dignity, hope and dreams. The end results are shown through this film showing the greed and Teflon coating of Wall Street, here is relation to the mortgage industries and the trading involved surrounding the performance instability of their assorted products. The pop culture of Americans at the time is shown as establishing shots, and it's quite sad to see what is celebrated as success. ""It was too good to be true"" rings throughout and the moralistic viewpoint is driven hard. As a mortgage industry professional, I see this as a brutally honest overview of the attitudes of those who stood to profit on the retail side of the issues. Those Florida Loan Officers are portrayed quite accurately. There is a solid amount of audience participation, experienced through actors speaking directly to the audience out of character to ensure the x's and o's of the discussion are clear as crystal. As Wall Street jargon and the speed of which it is ""name dropped"" for showmanship also is brought down to the viewer level through celebrity cameos reiterating the fancy scenario is fast paced, but still plain English. This is where the movie works best, as you can not expose an issue if the audience doesn't understand what you are saying, and it's not entertaining is taught as a school lesson. A necessary film and an honest experience perked up with clever perspectives."
" a robust picture wrestling with something dauntingly intractable
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,7,"It takes guts to make a film has an indignant through-line in its core: the capitalistic turpitude resides inveterately in human's speculative and grasping inclination, because there is no redeeming feeling of triumph or sympathy with which one can empathize in the ugly truth. In the hands of those privileged few (bankers, financiers, mortgage brokers, real state agents, etc.), millions of ordinary people suffer as the brunt of its disastrous repercussions (the global financial crisis in 2008), and what's more unnerving, the same skulduggery is wheeled out under a new name soon after, and it will only take time to reach a boiling point again, there is absolutely no cure to change the status quo, because that's nuts and bolts of capitalism, who dares to overturn capitalism?In the face of such exasperation and pessimism, which director Adam McKay has no scruples to force down viewer's throat (for some it may seem like a bolt out of the blue, but for majority of its audience, it is like flogging a dead horse: bankers are evil, roger that!), THE BIG SHORT pluckily alternates its three strands of individuals who successfully presage the crisis and leavens its mass appeal by using a mordant fourth-wall-breaking tack to elucidate its arcane gobbledygook and bean-spilling (sometimes with star cameos, for instance, Margo Robbie in her bathtub), interlaced with signposting snapshots and burnished by a cutting-edge montage job from Oscar-nominated editor Hank Corwin. In toto, it rounds outs as a disarmingly sleek infotainment.But, there is a catch, reckoning the nature of those real-life characters' actions, they are whip- smart profiteers, who jump on the window of opportunity and feather their nests in the wake of others' miseries, yet, McKay and co-screenwriter Charles Randolph also try to hold some of them in the moral high ground - namely Steve Carell's Mark Baum, who is deviled by his conscience and brims with sense of justice, and Christian Bale's Michael Burry, an one-eyed geek who at least invests his Brobdingnagian gain into good use (says the film's epilogue) - which is a safe move but clashes with the cynical reality it depicts, whereas both Oliver Stone's WALL STREET (1987) and Martin Scorsese's THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013) are much more honestly unsparing in scrutinizing the too-big-to-fall pathology and its fetidness. So a skeptical mind would unavoidably question, whether the supposed compassion towards these characters belies McKay's unsavory agenda to veer the film's tenor from a stringent exposé to an adulation of their (self-seeking) acts? That is a dangerous signal.The ensemble cast is blameless though, Christian Bale's Oscar-nominated turn is hyperbolically eccentric, but he is competent enough to not let him slide into caricature and brings out a nice patina of ambiguity, dispassion and even pathos (why should we feel sorry for him?). Ryan Gosling is unapologetically bumptious (fun to watch thought) as the chief narrator and Brad Pitt, again, takes a beneficent role without too much challenge (12 YEARS A SLAVE 2013, remember?), which leaves Steve Carrell, who, actually, materializes a toothsome performance in a border-line leading role, carries the momentum engagingly until an eleventh-hour capitulation, only undercut by the conservative slant of the writers': kitted with such ammo, instead of rubbing the salt into the still- fresh wounds of a dysfunctional society, why not leaving a chipper mood to suggest opportunist can still run away with it? That is a minor disgrace in an otherwise robust picture wrestling with something dauntingly intractable.P.S. My inner dialogue: ""- Hey, it is a biographical film, those who are still alive can sue us for calumny! - Yeah, than don't make a biopic, cinema is composed of lies, and reality sucks!."""
" Started watching a Comedy only to realize it was a Horror
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"They did a great job of explaining how the large banks manipulated CDO's and MBS's and fraudulent rating houses kept taking fees in exchange for favorable ratings.I honestly expected somewhere in this movie it would make me laugh.Not once. It should not be sold as a comedy. It is clearly a drama.The acting was good. Not great.One thing that they don't talk about in this movie is the root cause of the housing crisis was not just the fraudulent practices but the government complicity in creating the monster of the modern investment banks. The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act) removed the barriers created after the 1928 crash which now allowed investment banks to also buy and sell mortgages (among other things usually limited to smaller local banks). The federal government also lowered the lending standards for the low prime GDO Freddy Mae and Freddy Mac.But, Hollywood didn't want to mention that probably because it was their guys in office were largely to blame for allowing it all to happen.(SPOILER)When they mentioned that in a few years, Americans would blame immigrants and terrorism the movie kind of jumped the shark. The media can be blamed for allowing the lessons learned from the collapse would be forgotten."
" rage
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,10,"Cinema should inform, entertain, edify, provoke and incite curiosity. The Big Short has it all. It takes material that is difficult - deliberately fabricated to be difficult, as they point out - and makes it easy to understand without condescending to the audience. Having well-known celebrities explain the fraud highly-paid bankers, raters and other morally bankrupt individuals deployed is a marvelous, startling conceit. Breaking the fourth wall to explain what actually happened, and what the filmmakers added for dramatic effect, is simple, elegant and gratifying. Watching this in 2017 gives added hue - as the film presciently states, the poor and immigrants are being blamed for a crisis that a bloated, self-absorbed, callous elite brought down on our heads. And to our shame, we have forgotten, moved on, and seem destined to repeat the same mistakes. Outstanding performances from all the actors, doing an incredible script the service it deserves. Humorous at times, it also strives to be corrosively satirical, and empathetic to the true victims of this narrative. A perfect film, that I will watch again and again."
" Go Long
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,10,"The Big Short is a movie based on a book by Michael Lewis who has brought us such stories as Liar's Poker and Moneyball and who bluntly is a national treasure. Nobody seems to be able to explain complex ideas about Wall Street as well as he does and the movie adaptation does a fantastic job explaining how various bond instruments work and how people ended up buying junk which was rated AAA.As someone who has worked on Wall Street (and Broad and Midtown and Boca Raton ) I have a good foundation of what happened and even I found myself learning something and having complex things explained in such a way as an aha moment clicked in.Now I don't want to make this sound like a dreary documentary. This is more The Wolf of Wall Street than a Ken Burns documentary. The film follows some of the people who realizing that there was a housing bubble and deciding to try to short the market. The Big Short emphasizes that even if they were right (and they were) they still could lose everything by getting the timing wrong or simply by having the investment banks refuse to price the instruments accurately. This brilliantly creates a true tension where the film could have simply been a disaster film with the audience screaming at the screen don't invest in that house.The Big Short sometimes is too on the nose for its own good. (=As an example having the spokeslady for the rating agencies wearing giant glaucoma glasses is a sledgehammer where none was needed. But the film quickly redeems itself with some wonderful fourth wall breaking where one of our heroes explains they did not find the answer in a pile of discarded prospectuses in an investment bank waiting room but actually by doing research but that we need a Raider's of the Lost Ark type discovery because movie. A great film that entertains first. I cannot recommend enough. Also, I learned never order the fish stew on Sunday."
" Boom!
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,10,A truly great film about the corruption in the financial sector. I enjoyed every minute of it and also it was very close to home. I used to set these things up on back office trading systems after they were dealt.I began to notice that we were moving away from ordinary bonds to MBA's - (Mortgage Back Assets) and after a while we moved onto CDO's (Collateral Debt Obligations).What I could never understand - but personally found reassuring - was why the always had such high ratings. I didn't want my bank to take any undue risks and go bust because my job depended on it.In around 2006 I read the 'Economist' and there was a mention about these subprime mortgages. I felt uneasy so I sent them a mail asking why mortgage backed bonds in general had such good ratings... No reply.Anyway I lost my job with them around July 2006 when my job went out to India as I was told they needed to cut costs (It later transpired that the cost of providing two direct connections between the trading floor and the Indian back office cost more than keeping the team in London). However I was treated fairly and got a decent redundancy package and soon found a new job.2008 - kerpow! my ex employer took a huge hit and a year later had to transfer Euro 85bn of problem assets off its balance sheet. It now no longer exists - a once proud bank. Total losses (so far) which had to be covered 23 billion dollars. Numerous trading scandals were unearthed and a new scandal is just being investigated. With hindsight I'm glad I lost my job to get out of the mayhem - but 1000's of jobs were lost in London and Germany due to high level incompetence.There's another crash on the way as Donald is just stirring things up nicely.
" A White Supremacy Film
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,6,"The movie itself is good, that I have to say. However, in the choice of actors, the file it is full of stereotype:1. Minorities and female roles are simply silly or greedy as depicted by this film. Especially, all three Asian role are negative, either greedy or dumb. 2. All smart guys that see through the shorts are white male. 3. No white female are positive either. 4. Most of the people in the film that are not white male simply accept the living under the fraud and dare not to doubt it. Only white males are ""courageous and smart"" enough to make a difference.Conclusion: I cannot say the deception is intentional, however, it is so stereotyped and misleading."
" One of 2015's best films
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,9,"Adam McKay's ""The Big Short"" is the best financial movie I have seen since watching Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" (1987), but the only difference between these two movies is that this movie was based on true events. The film takes place before and during the recession of 2008 in which some aspects of this movie are pretty funny if you ask me. The movie was adapted from the book by Michael Lewis and it basically starts off with Dr. Michael J. Burry (Christian Bale) who was the first person to predict the housing market crash by actually betting against the housing market before it actually happened despite everyone else thinking that he was a crazy person. Then 20 minutes into the film we see a banker named Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) talk to a Morgan Stanley employee named Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and his coworkers and Vennett tells them that not long from now the economy is going to collapse and that nobody was even talking about it. also during the movie and in between all of the financial conversations Baum is going through a personal tragedy that I will not reveal in this review for those people that haven't seen the movie, and Baum is getting comforted between phone calls and at home by his wife (Marisa Tomei). The screenplay for this movie by McKay along with Charles Randolph took home the Oscar last year for best adapted screenplay and I had a few minor gripes with it here and there but then again it was directed by a man who normally does comedies. Then later in this movie we see 2 other men in the finance world (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock) end contacting a retired trader by the name of Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) who is the fourth person to predict the collapse of the housing market. the only major problem I had with this movie was the shaky camera angles which could have been improved on, and also I think that Adam McKay could have been more impartial instead of openly mocking the corporations but then again that is just my opinion, but otherwise the performances from Bale (who got an Oscar nomination), Gosling, Carell, and Pitt are top notch, as well as Marisa Tomei's. This is one of last year's greatest achievements in film, and I stand by this review."
" The Big Short, an Emotional Oxymoron
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,9,"Few Americans were left exempt from the 2007-08 housing crash that would spark the largest economic recession since the 1930's Wall Street fiasco. Adam McKay's satirical comedy The Big Short highlighted the twisted realities that a detached populous inherits when Wall Street bankers are left to their own devices not through the heartbreaking imagery of a shattered middle America, but rather the antics of the very hedge fund managers that foresaw and profited from their demise. These glorified Vegas gamblers were played by the film's star studded cast including Steve Carrell as the loud-mouthed watch dog Mark Baum, Ryan Gosling as the swanky mover-and-shaker Jared Venett, and Brad Pitt as the former Wall Street cutthroat turned moral-compass-wielding white knight Ben Rickert. While each of these gentlemen embraced their roles near flawlessly, the standout performance was stolen by the Nostradamus of the housing bubble, Christian Bale. In his transformational role as Dr. Michael Burry, Bale captures the eccentricity of a man dismissed as a lunatic by his peers and clients in such a way that the viewer sympathizes in the marvel of his genius.The performances by the A-List ensemble were accompanied by a magnificently selected and well-timed soundtrack that was the musical embodiment of the pre-Recession arrogance that was America's financial system. While dizzying at times, the choppy scene shots, quick camera movement, and real world video insertions serve as foreshadowing of the extent of the chaos looming beneath the feet of the unsuspecting global economy while displaying McKay's distinctive style.When developing the screenplay, the film's writers had to overcome the hurdle that lay at the root of the housing market crash itself, the Average Joe's lack of understanding of what the hell these Wall Street snobs were doing behind the curtain. McKay masterfully accomplishes this by incorporating on-screen vocabulary and unique video cuts featuring the likes of Selena Gomez playing blackjack and Margot Robbie in a bubble bath. These offer both explanations for the financial jargon being tossed around in layman's terms and poke at American pop culture's obsession with celebrity activity while adding a stylistic eccentricity in line with the rest of film. Despite being tagged as an R-Rated comedy with an array of profane language, housing tycoon strippers, and fourth-wall breaking character monologues like those found in Carrell's hit series The Office, The Big Short transcends playful political satire. Each on-screen act of careless greed re-opens middle America's emotional scarring inflicted by the Great Recession and leaves viewers with sobering recollections of distrust and uncertainty that continue to ripple through cultural and political discussion today. While butter-doused popcorn alongside your favorite boxed candy and a monstrous fountain soda are clear necessities to properly enjoy this must-see satirical film revolving around pompous American culture, be sure to pack a toothbrush and some Altoids for the bitter taste that will be left in your mouth after watching."
" Definitely a better than Sub Prime
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,9,"I was looking for something to have on in the background whilst I did some work. What could be less distracting that a movie about the banking crisis? The subject matter is quite dry but the makers of this film use some interesting techniques to make it more palatable. Quite often a character may turn to camera and make a comment that answers a question you were just about to pose.It gets quirky in places, we may switch to a supermodel in the bath to explain a dull, but important, banking process using a clever analogy.These techniques are used sparingly, holding the balance between quirky and wacky.The characters are very engaging, probably a little over egged but I found myself on the edge of my seat when everything came to a head.I didn't know quite as much about the crisis as I thought I did meaning there is an element of suspense.I wasn't expecting much from this movie so I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is clever, interesting and entertaining. If you have Netflix definitely give it a go."
" Work of fiction
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,1,"So misleading a tale about what caused the housing meltdown I consider it a work of fiction.How can the the writer as well as the nation that lived during this time period be so cluelessas to not remember the evens that happened? Does anyone watch the news or hear what our politicians are meddling in any more?When I was moving to a new home in 2005, I noticed 9 out of 10 homes I was looking at were vacant. I knew then we were heading for a serious meltdown in home prices.I stopped at a new housing project and the sales team were all bragging about the moneythey were making buying the spec homes and flipping them. I was hearing from friends that workedin downtown Detroit about the massive numbers of fraudulent home sales where home ""buyers"" wouldbuy a house that should have been torn down, apply for a loan and split the proceeds of the fraudwith the seller, appraiser and loan taker. Why would any bank buy such worthless junk? They wouldn't.President Bush ordered FreddieMac to buy as many poor/minority owned/low FICO score home loans as possible. At the peak of the bubble, FreddieMac owned 6 trillion dollars of these.Google the following and read the facts;""...The President set a goal to increase the number of minority homeowners by 5.5 million familiesby the end of the decade. Through his home-ownership challenge, the President called on the privatesector to help in this effort. More than two dozen companies and organizations have made commitments to increase minority home- ownership - including pledges to provide more than $1.1 trillion in mortgage purchases for minority home buyers this decade..."""
" Ruined the ending . . .
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,2,"Was a little tough to follow because there were so many different people/entities involved. I'm sure if I saw it again, it would be more clear.Was thoroughly enjoying the movie until they got political at the very end. I won't spoil it for anyone, but they said something about immigration that offended me. When the movie was over, I couldn't help but taste the political remarks they dropped at the end of the movie. Hollywood seems to have forgotten that we watch movies for entertainment. Even if we have wonderful fulfilling lives already, we want to vicariously experience something else when we watch movies. I was enjoying the movie until Hollywood took a dump in my living room."
" The Big Short is one to definitely go Long for...
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"It's been a number of years since the big crash that began in 2007/08, and despite appearances to the contrary, we are all still paying for the costs from that time. Government mishandling, regulatory body incompetence, banking misadventures and mortgage sellers fraudulence combined to create one of mankind's greatest synthetic disasters.The underlying themes are complex to why it all happened, but as an introduction and understanding there has been little better as a package than this film. Having read the book, I'm happy that the film makers took the material as reference, and filmed this in their own way. It does a fine job in taking us thru the multitude of characters who are responsible for the disaster, explaining in some wonderful scenes the products behind the problems.Whilst all this is happening, we are following a handful of people who take advantage having seen the truth behind the sham. Our mixed cast is given mostly equal billing with Brad Pitt (mostly unrecognisable), Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling playing their roles perfectly. The story takes time, but you will be gripped, despite already knowing the inevitable outcome.This is an excellent introduction to the whole period, even if it is an uncomfortable viewing for many. Maybe this film will be better appreciated in a generation by those who didn't sit through the times. If you want Wolf of Wall Street, best move along, this is thankfully not that movie. Recommended viewing."
" The Strongest Film of 2015
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,9,"The Big Short was not a film I loved the first time I watched it. The characters were on the surface unlikable, the content was not particularly thrilling and the directorial and editing choices in this movie were somewhat unconventional. But upon a second and third viewing, I realized that quite simply, this thing is a masterpiece. The actors involved all put in superb performances, thought I am not as keen on Steve Carell's role as others may be. Gosling, Bale, Pitt, and a slew of lesser known names bring their A game. The director, Adam Mckay, is able to make finance, banking and intricacies of Wall Street scamming not just accessible but damn interesting. The movie moves at a brisk pace, with lots of flashy cameos, sharp inter cuts and snippets of financial education delivered in memorable and clever ways. When you realize that the story revolves around a recent chapter in American history that many are still somewhat ignorant to, the film is elevated to greatness. Highly recommended and strong replay value."
" The Best Film Made On this Moment in History... Almost!
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,9,"If anyone hasn't seen ""The Big Short"" yet, it comes highly recommended. Not only just it uncover the absolutely fraudulent nature of Wall-Street, in the years prior to the Financial Crisis, but it breaks down the various financial technicalities into easily palatable and understandable metaphors.Anyone else thinks this movie looks like it is set in the 80s and not 2005? I refuse to believe I dressed like that 10 years ago. The film stars a whole skew of Hollywood leading me to take on the shady men. most importantly, Ryan Gosling. Okay forget that part. It really is quite a movie: entertaining and engaging, but also mortifying; As Roger Ebert's website puts it: A good alternate title might be ""American Horror Story.""The movie is a fairly accurate portrayal of the events surrounding the initial financial shock which culminated in the 2008/09 Financial Crisis and excels in mixing humour and serious candour to communicate its message.How accurate was the subject matter of the movie? Pretty accurate really, and it is much better than reading the scathing 663 page report from the US Government on the subsequent crisis.Surprisingly, the screenplay is almost as well-structured, informative, and entertaining an adaptation of a complex work of non-fiction as Nicholas Pileggi's and Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. McKay and Randolph focus on just the right number of characters and find inventive ways to keep the movie light, funny, and easy to understand; yet their approach almost never devolves into shtick or patronizingly juvenile spoon-feeding of information. Unlike most documentaries about the causes of the global 2008 recession, The Big Short doesn't work backwards, investigating abstract causes and effects. Instead, it gives us compelling, quirky protagonists we can identify with and intertwines the minutia of the financial system into the goals, obstacles, and story arcs of these men. Though McKay and Randolph utilize several narrative devices I don't love—multiple narrators directly addressing the camera, breaking story continuity to explain complex concepts in whimsical ways, video clip montages meant to set time and place or contextualise ideas—these are few and far between and, for the most part, they work.Unfortunately, the same can't be said for McKay's directing style. I wish McKay, the head writer for Saturday Night Live during one of its stronger eras, had more faith in the written word, but his bloated, semi-improvised comedy features rush through as many jokes as possible, never fully allowing a whole to form from the sum of its parts. The hurried approach is even more injurious to this primarily dramatic feature. The Big Short is not a patient movie and therefore it's far less potent than J. C. Chandor's tense and secretive Margin Call (2011)—still the best film made on this moment in history. And should've won an Oscar for ""best picture"" rather than just getting a nomination. You are free to disagree. But this is a movie that uses both cinema art and irrefutable facts to make its case. It's strong stuff. Especially, the cast was spectacular!I began off feeling wary about this motion picture: the haircuts and garments of the primary characters were more '90s music-video than mid 2000s, and the occasionally shading de-saturated flashbacks to a few characters' back stories were a little on the inauspiciously typical side. Be that as it may, the story force, joined with the base mind of a significant part of the exchange, and the submitted acting going ahead underneath the hairpieces, all did their employment. What's more, they got over the irate, skeptical conviction behind the motion picture, which is that the real banks all occupied with fake, criminal action, and that the U.S. government safeguarded them out to the detriment of the little person, and that there's no sign that the banks wouldn't accomplish something like precisely the same once more. You are allowed to oppose this idea. Be that as it may, this is a motion picture that utilizes both silver screen craftsmanship and evident realities to put forth its defence. It's solid stuff. The Big Short is a blended pack that I in any case prescribe seeing. Superior to anything any account or narrative film, TV show, or radio program I've yet observed or listened, it clarifies credit default swaps, subprime home loans, collateral's obligation commitments, and other money related builds in clear, intelligible terms. It abstains from damning things down to the point of haughtiness, yet by one means or another remaining parts a somewhat unblinking standard stimulation."
" Every American needs to watch this... and get mad.
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,10,"Wow. Just wow. I thought I knew enough about the crash of '08 but this film explains every angle and tells you all about the background shade leading to the robbery of the American Dream for most Americans. I knew about people buying house they couldn't afford, I knew about the garbage bonds and rigging of the etc, etc, etc. But OMG, the whole system is dirty. These people shouldn't be allowed to see the light of day if you ask me but they're living large and playing your average American into slavery. Bankers, Wallstreet 'ladies of the night' and the lot of them. The system isn't broken.. it is just working against your average American. And this movie gives you a much needed peak into the circus."
" A unique way of depicting a true story
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"Adam McKay offers a different perspective with regards to telling a true story. He provides us with frequent Fourth Wall breaks and cameo appearances to help us the audience understand very specific terminology, as well as analogies which also provides the film with an educational undertone to it. Standout performances from the main 4 ensemble cast, who all create interesting and memorable characters. After watching this picture it will leave you feeling cynical and judgemental to anyone who associates themselves with finance. Overall, The Big Short is a very specific true story that doesn't try to hide anything from you and instead gives you true emotions and attitudes towards a nationwide financial meltdown, with the only regret being the re-watch value to the film as you can't bring yourself to watch a powerful depiction of corruption and greed more than once."
" Surprisingly captivating
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"The Big Short tells about the years leading to the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008, which was caused by the United States housing bubble. It shows and explains how the situation came to be and how certain people managed to predict its inevitability and exploited it to get rich. It's filled with powerhouse actors, is over two hours long and contains almost nothing but talk about economics, money and similar things.And yet it's a rather good film. This is thanks to a few things. First are the actors. Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt and most of the others are huge talents and their sheer presence manages to make most of the scenes work. The second reason is the script and the fact that it focuses more on the people behind the crisis rather than the crisis itself. It explores how our own ignorance, laziness and stupidity caused the housing bubble and how it took certain amount of outside the box thinking to realize it was happening.That being said, I also admire how the film manages to make the crisis itself understandable and relatable to mass audiences. Whenever the plot brings up a hard term or an odd concept, the film takes a brief moment to stop and explain the thing in layman's terms, but in a way that in no way hinders the narrative. It's actually really clever how they pull it off, though I shall not spoil it here.All in all The Big Short is a really good drama film. I know it doesn't sound that exciting, but trust me that in this case the execution is so good that it just works."
" Informative, but not much else
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"'The Big Short' is a good film to watch if you want to educate yourself about economics and learn about the housing bubble collapse, because it's highly informative and insightful. From an entertainment point of view though, there isn't much to be enjoyed here.Even if you can keep up and understand what's going on in the film, there isn't much to keep the viewer interested. The film is perfect for somebody who has an interest in the subject matter, but isn't much fun for everybody else. That said, 'The Big Short' is a very well made film and you'll feel slightly smarter for seeing it.An informative, well-made film that isn't sufficiently mainstream to be appreciated by large audiences, but great for people with prior knowledge and an interest in this subject matter."
" Economics as a confusing way of the world
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.A genuine solid movie about economics. A story that has a lot to say both in the perspective of it being an authentic story, and also about how the world is fictionalized to create scenarios of the financial worlds.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Solid. Very good. - The actors : A movie that gained attention in the Academy Award world. Says it all. - Entertainment : If you like an drama with a true story behind and the almost confusing world of economics; yes. - Age : 157,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)"
