" Another amazing entry in the franchise
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,10,"This film ticked all of the boxes. The action was of course top notch, the actors all brought their A-game (Rebecca Ferguson was a welcome new edition), and McQuarrie knows how to make an incredible thriller. If you love action films, this franchise, and crazy Tom Cruise stunts, I highly recommend giving this film a watch."
" Another high octane thriller!
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,8,"This entry keeps the same working formula as its predecessors. High quality, well choreographed and very memorable action scenes. The underwater scene was one of the best.The plot lost me a little halfway through but it was explained and turned out pretty well.Tom Cruise is the GOAT!"
" This Franchise Somehow Keeps on Getting Better!
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Scrap what I said about Ghost Protocol and MI3, THIS is the best one in the franchise. Obviously the stunts are great, the action is a lot of fun and the cast are all doing a great job - that's practically a given at this point. But the big improvement in this one compared to the previous instalments is that this has a great villain in Solomon Lane. His motivations are clear and he is an intimidating screen presence whenever he appears. Ilsa is a good addition, as is Alec Baldwin, who basically just plays Laurence Fishburne in MI3, but is still pretty good. The action isn't quite as good as the last one - nothing has topped the Burj Khalifa sequence so far in any of these films - but it is still really fun to watch, and I honestly think this is just the best overall story of the series too. Overall, there really isn't that much to say. It's a film with a relatively simple appeal and it's effective at keeping you engaged for the entirety of its runtime."
" Greatness, once again
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"The first scene perfectly captures the movie: fast and jaw-dropping. It is an action packed movie, and it is goddamn good. It shows how rare a franchise like MI is, being the fourth great movie (and third in a row) in the series.
Cruise's chemistry with everyone is as fluid as ever and the team feels more mature and, at the same time, more interesting. Solomon Lane is a great antagonist and there is no denying Sean Harris gets a well deserved second best villain in the franchise, only after legendary Philip Seymour Hoffman.
It is a great movie, executed brilliantly and it deserves the praise it gets."
" Best since DePalma
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,8,"The best film so far in the series second only to the original 1996 film.
They really stepped it up since the days of MI2."
" A beautiful setup
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,7,"This review contains spoilers.Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is the fifth installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise. Rogue Nation is the direct sequel to 2011's Ghost Protocol. Once again the movie stars Tom Cruise in the leading role of Ethan Hunt. Some of the cast members from Ghost Protocol return and reprise their roles as part of Ethan Hunt's team. Of note of the returning cast, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, and Ving Rhames return and reprise their roles.Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation starts a new story, Ethan Hunt wants to prove the existence of the syndicate, a criminal organization with ties across the entire world. The Impossible Missions Force has been absorbed by the Central Intelligence Agency, and Ethan Hunt is cut off from outside help. Ethan Hunt recruits his team and they set off to find bring the syndicate to justice.The action in this movie is great to watch. Like the previous movie Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation is a well shot, and well edited movie. The action set pieces in this movie are fun to watch. There is not as much grandeur to the action set pieces this time around. The movie uses historical locations as a backdrop to action scenes which is a cool touch. As said before, the movie is beautiful. This may be the prettiest Mission: Impossible movie. The opera scene offered blazing visuals to see. Robert Elswit, the cinematographer, should be commended for his fine work.The plot in this movie is not pearly as engaging as Ghost Protocol. The stakes in this movie are not nearly as high and the plot felt like establishing more of a world rather than creating a fun stand-alone adventure. The main component of this is the setup of MI-6 and Ilsa Faust. Ilsa Faust is a fun character, to watch. She made up a large portion of this movie. Likewise, the plot with MI6 and the Syndicate served to build up the Mission: Impossible's world instead of building its own story. I was personally fine with this as the action was still engaging.Overall I would recommend Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation.Grade: B"
" TOM CRUISE!!!
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,8,"More studded with cool danger action, coupled with a cast that always looks perfect. MI is the only movie series that is increasingly quality."
" Perfect mindless action film
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,7,"Infinite number of bad guys.
Good guys who always have everything they need.Who carries a defibrillator on a mission?If you're looking for something mindless with lots of shiny objects, this is a great film, but isn't Tom Cruise getting a little old for this?"
" The best one of all six films my favorite Mission: Impossible film
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,10,My number 1 favorite Mission: Impossible film and to me the best one ever in the franchise is Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation! For many reasons I love this film to death. Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust was excellent choice as a female lead cast. The movie felt realistic by time to time. The action sequences are very dangerous in this film. The airplane scenes in the beginning of the movie were dangerous. The car chases and the motorcycle chases was very dangerous the most dangerous stunts Tom Cruise ever did. Nice to see Alec Baldwin in this movie as a CIA Agent. He played Jack Ryan CIA Agent in a John McTiernan film The Hunt for Red October (1990). Great direction by Christopher McQuarrie he directed Jack Reacher his first movie with Tom Cruise which I like and this was his first Mission: Impossible movie he directed. Was nice to see Jeremy Renner as William Brendt from Ghost Protocole and of course Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. Ethan Hunt been now a Rogue IMF Agent goes after a shadowy and deadly rogue organization called the Syndicate who framed him by and make him in to a wanted fugitive.
" Impressive very impressive!!
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,8,"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is an action movie directed by Christopher McQuarrie and stars Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris and Alec Baldwin.After watching this movie I have to admit that the franchise is improving with it's every release and setting new expectations with every release.The movie starts with a breathtaking stunt and gives you goosebumps which can make your expectations skyrocketed and you will not be disappointed.The plot of the movie is good and intelligently executed. The screenplay of the movie is nicely woven and with some good twists and turns the movie will keep you glued to the screen.Acting is superb and stunts are the strongest factor of the movie as the movie is full of stunts. Cinematography is beautiful and locations are also very beautiful.Overall a great movie of the franchise and a must watch for all the action lovers."
" Low-key the weirdest MI movie simply because of the dialogue and the fact that Ethan Hunt goes completely insane.
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,8,"I love how it builds upon the event of the previous one and introduces a lot personal stakes for the team, especially with the character of Benji towards the end. Simon Pegg was great comic relief in Ghost Protocol, but here he's the heart and soul of the movie (God I love Benji!).Rebecca Ferguson is also great, though I will admit it was very frustrating how despite the fact that she kept betraying everyone, Lane just kept giving her more chances. You'd think he'd just kill her by now.Speaking of Lane, I like him. He's no Philip Seymour Hoffman, but Sean Harris is still one of the most interesting MI villains if solely for the choices he makes with his performance.Not much else say other than it's a badass action movie and probably the entry where I most care about the story. Not as slickly directed or well paced as the previous one, but it makes up for it. Boy does it make up for it.Also, the opera scene. Just... the opera scene. Wow."
" Better than most franchise action films
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,5,I enjoyed it as pure escapist nonsense and was not looking for anything more from it. It is however over long and felt like a slog for the last 45mins
" Desperate Times Desperate Measures
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,10,Mission Impossible Rogue Nation Was Awesome Lot Of Fun From Start To Finish Lot Good Action Stunt Work and story was very enjoyable
" Mission Impossible
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,8,This 1 was 1 of my favorites of the mission impossible franchise the rogue nations the appear a true mission impossible plan and like Tom Cruise and thing rheims then you'll love this wonder to must see
" Ahh, what a recovery.
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,9,"Ethan Hunt is a character that is at times confusing, chaotic and charming but is a good friend all the time. He doesn't know his boundaries sure, but that's why he is a part of ""Impossible Mission Force"". After the debacle of MI 2 and a so so MI3, MI4 and MI5 really surprised me. The action in the movie was smooth and not over the top. The score was appropriate and not overly loud at places and the chase sequences were exceptional.I am not a fan of action genre, I prefer the minimal action in movies and I am also not a great fan of movie series but somwhere along the line something comes that makes you forget about your notions that you had for a specific thing. I prefer Daniel Craig's James Bond because it is not JUST action. Mission Impossible is more action but it is justified. And also, american movies have to have the spice of a good action if the movie is sold under""Action"" genre.Enough said, Tom Cruise is a great actor and though these movies are not Oscar-worthy, he still deserves an oscar once in his lifetime. Simon pegg, love him. Rebecca Ferguson is talented and beautiful. Jeremy Renner- no comment. I am forgetting the name but Marcellus Wallace is apt.A good watch. Cheers."
" Rogue nation manages to reach a new level, being a complex espionage plot, but easy to understand for the public eager for blockbusters
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,8,"Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, responsible for the screenplay for The Suspects (Bryan Singer's version) and who previously directed Tom Cruise on Jack Reacher, this Rogue nation rescues the nefarious Syndicate from the TV series, which, acting as the SPECTRE of Mission: Impossible, it is behind almost all the main crimes and acts of terrorism that occurred around the world. Determined to destroy the organization led by the ruthless Solomon Lane (Harris), the hero Ethan Hunt (Cruise) ends up being captured, escaping death thanks to the help of the mysterious Ilsa Faust (Ferguson). However, when the Mission Impossible Force is dismantled by CIA director Alan Hunley (Baldwin), Hunt becomes a renegade, being pursued by the US government while trying to complete his dangerous task. To this end, he is assisted by former teammates Benji Dunn (Pegg), Luther Stickell (Rhames) and William Brandt (Renner).If you follow Hunt's adventures from the original, directed by master Brian De Palma in 1996, you know that this is the fourth time (in five films) that he has become a ""renegade"" and that on at least three occasions a traitor has infiltrated his agency - and the fact that he continues to work there is proof of his persistence or his ingenuity or his stupidity or all of the previous alternatives. In any case, this new chapter maintains several of the series' traditions: the team has to invade an overprotected location; the masks that transform one person into another appear again; characters play double (or triple) game; the action spreads to several cities on the planet; and, of course, equipment with advanced technology is employed (my favorite here is a magazine that works like a laptop).However, the fact of recycling elements does not mean that M: I 5 is predictable or boring, since each of them gains new features through the creativity of McQuarrie as a screenwriter and director: the invasion, for example, now involves a challenge underwater, while the various action sequences are conducted with enviable mastery, appearing dynamic, surprising and - unlike so many gender colleagues - never confused, allowing us to understand exactly what is happening. In fact, in this respect the visual effects are fantastic, as they immerse the viewer in the middle of a motorcycle chase, keeping us in front of Tom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson while zigzagging at 100 miles an hour in heavy traffic without ever realizing them all. the trickery necessary for the camera to make impossible movements and for the actors to appear to be taking risks. And if most action films would reserve the scene that brings Hunt hanging outside an airplane to the climax of the projection, here it opens the narrative, which shows admirable courage on the part of the filmmakers.And if you don't have any expectations about the plane scene, which, after all, dominated the project's marketing campaign, M: I 5 also doesn't make the public wait long to see Tom Cruise doing what has become his trademark: running - something he already starts the film doing. The actor's energy, by the way, is something admirable, since Cruise demonstrates his usual intensity in each movement he performs. However, this time he can also explore a little his little-used talent for comedy, both in subtler moments (such as the quick deviation from looking when he realizes he is struggling with someone much bigger) and in others where he surprises with humor physical (such as when trying to jump over the hood of a car while you are weakened). The most curious thing, however, is to see how over the previous films Cruise has made Ethan Hunt a true icon - and thus it is hilarious to see how his partner Benji (who Pegg lives with the usual talent) seems to see him as capable anything, showing no doubt, for example, that he would be able to hold his breath for minutes and minutes and minutes. (And is anyone surprised to find that, after all, Hunt is an excellent draftsman?).
The fact is that Rogue nation hardly connects with events from previous films. It works almost like an ""original"" film. The change is always welcome, as it brings new life to each film in the series. Here, McQuarrie simply elevates Mission: Impossible to the state of the art of spy films, recovering the architecture of the sequences woven by De Palma in the 1996 film and also inherits the distrust in the author's images to return to the roots of the spy thriller. This is probably the most ""James Bond"" chapter in the series, not only for its plot, but for the depth of the characters and their plot. Never has a story of the other impossible missions been so full of puzzles and espionage that it doesn't fall into the cliché. Of course, the official synopsis may release just one more story from an agency involved with betrayals in its circle, but the development of the script is much more refined than this simple idea.Based on the game of truths that reveal lies, illusionism, false images, the director does not stick to an intricate plot to compose the suspense, he is intrinsic to the action itself, the images speak for themselves more than anything. This is great for McQuarrie, who above all has the task of making a fun movie that has good segments of espionage and acrobatics, which do not get over thanks to the simple script that maintains the episodic character of the other sequences in the franchise. Spies seduced by the sophisticated ambivalence of the issues at stake are mistaken and immerse themselves in the occasions that surround them by being entertained by the discovery and the succession of events in a very direct way.Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames and Alec Baldwin are limited by the relatively short screen time, Briton Sean Harris turns villain Solomon Lane into a mix of Blofeld and Moriarty, suggesting intelligence, cruelty and danger in equal measures. But who really deserves to be highlighted is the beautiful Rebecca Ferguson, who plays Ilsa Faust, an agent infiltrated in the Union who helps and at the same time plays with Hunt, leaving the feeling that she cannot be trusted. The actress is more than ""the sexy woman from Mission Impossible"". She has an important stake in the action and true motivations. Like Ethan, the viewer will be involved by the character, who comes to the rescue of the protagonist several times.The director takes advantage of the lessons learned from Jack Reacher: The Last Shot (2012), which he also directed, and No Limit of Tomorrow (2014), with a script of his own (by the way, both works with Cruise), and takes advantage of the two hours of film to launch explosive sequences almost uninterrupted. Cruise continues to show courage (or is it lack of awareness?) When performing most sequences, without the help of stuntmen. It looks like detail, but there is a feeling of verisimilitude. Be it the initial pre-credits with the classic track, with Hunt trying to get on a plane in midair, underwater or even naked chasing motorcycles (which manages to be much superior to the chase seen in the second film in the franchise). The filmmaker understands what few directors of the genre know: sound editing that favors ambient audio is much more tense than a track that, even if subliminally, indicates to the viewer what will happen. And in these last two specific sequences, especially under the water, the work is exquisite.The few problems in the feature happen with the arrival of the third act. There is a distinct loss of pace, leaving the impression that the film has a few more scenes than it should. It's not something that detracts greatly from the experience, but the film declines and creeps into its climax. Another point is that, at times, it requires a lot of suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer and starts to make everything very convenient for the group of heroes.
This is perhaps the chapter in the franchise that brings the most ambitious and intelligent track: composed by Joe Kraemer, it employs the classic and contagious theme of Lalo Schifrin in a punctual and certain way in the key moments of the action, also using only his initial chords to indicate changes in the scenario (as in the transition to Morocco). But Kraemer's great insight lies in the brilliant way in which he uses chords from Turandot's ""Nessun Dorma"" aria to comment on the dynamics between Ethan and Ilsa: in addition to reflecting the similarities in the couple's character (who, like those between Princesa Turandot and Calaf, originate the mutual attraction they start to feel), the reference is sure to appear for the first time in a scene in which Ilsa presents Ethan with three options, since this echoes the three puzzles of the opera.Mission: Impossible: Rogue nation is an action movie, which manages to have a life independent of its great predecessor by the way it installed a certain suspense in its final stretch, where Hunt would have to prove that everything was not just a delusion of his head, as some come to think. This legacy of The Suspects (1995), McQuarrie's first screenplay, is one of the great successes of the 90s, made a difference. Whether for Tom Cruise's boldness, great script or safe driving, MI5 deserves the ticket he paid for. Rogue nation manages to reach a new level, becoming probably the best of the five. The balance is positive for all sides, be it a complex espionage plot, but easy to understand for the public eager for blockbusters. It not only brings a great story but also fantastic action scenes that enchant by technical complexity as well as hook us directly through emotion. In the end, this new Mission: Impossible, so passionate about opera, becomes one. After all, we know what we will find, however, still, we return to glimpse its beauty and surprise us with the different interpretations of each director who works with these works."
" A good action thriller
",2020-07-22 00:00:00,6,"It's a good action thriller, far from the worst in the series but somewhat inferior in it's comedy and writing to the previous one, still very enjoyable with nice twists here and their."
" Very entertaining...
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,6,"Great action flick with great writing that doesn't require time jumps to create tension in a linear very entertaining movie. The pace is perfect and there is not a boring moment.At the same time, some of the missions are either a bit too ridiculous even for MI standards (the one involving water) or have parts of them that are a bit too ridiculous or forced (a lot of predicting how the villains would react for them to work); we have more of the same ""Deux Ex Machina"" typical of the franchise; the characters remains thin; the lack of emotion hurted the twists and turns.But for fans of the franchise, there is a big chance this one could be the best one yet."
" Planning Backstage.
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,10,"The best part of this movie is that everything that happened was in front of our eyes,no planning backstage by any character and no sudden changes in the plot.I hate it when the main character is about to die, and suddenly something different shows up and boom! The entire situation changed and now he is about to win. Luckily nothing like that in this movie."
" Great Action Movie!
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,9,"It has Tom Cruise in it, so it's already an awesome movie."
" Recommended 👍
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,7,Very cool I liked the idea of having a cool american hero who accomplishes impossible missions possible lol
" Opera and choir music is annoyingly prevalent
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,6,"Really, this isn't about the movie per se. Just this: If you don't like church choir music, opera? Don't watch the first hour. It'll drive you NUTS!"
" Boring
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,1,"Watched half and fell asleep , same old formula reheated with the same aging actors , slowly sinking into the swamp . Nothing new , go for a walk and you will see far more interesting stuff and people . This film is pathetic ."
" Good entertainment - Spoiler alert
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,6,Some great thrills and spills. Really terrific stunts.I was cross with Ethan for saving Benjie though. Even though Benjie was less goofie than in the last outing I was still rooting for his demise.
" Yay
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,10,I like the bit with the motorbike. Even better than the original
" Highly disappointing
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,2,"This was painful to watch. I love the series and, with the exclusion of MI:2 witch I haven't watched, everything else has been a 7 or higher in my little book of highly subjective ratings.
Rogue Nation on the other hand was just too braindead for my liking; nonsensical plot hole gallore to the point that I REALLY struggled to watch it through to the end. If I'm being a bit too harsh here is only because I believe they can do so much better, and I've already got a proof for that: It's called 'Fallout', made by basically the exact same fellas as this one.
I would give this a one, gets an extra star only for the excellent intro with the airplane (which had nothing to do with the rest of the movie)"
" Good James Bond copy
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,5,"The film has a lot of action, is exciting and a happy ending.
I liked the previous part better."
" JUST AMAZING
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,9,"This is best movie, go for it without any doubt. u will love it"
" he y
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,7,"It is said that Rebecca, who is the best match with Atango, is really beautiful and has a great play. There is actually Zhang Jingchu"
" Perfectionism!
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,10,"Tom Cruise is a perfectionist and we can see it here again! I admire his high level of professionalism and ethical conduct that make him one of the very best artists in the history of filmmaking. It is simply impossible not to praise the best and give this film the top grade. The same goes for the sixth episode: Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018). I will be more than happy to discover the seventh and eight episodes, still directed by Christopher McQuarrie and initially planned for 2021 and 2022, whenever it is really safe for the production to resume activities after the Great Lockdown.9.8/10"
" Defination of flawless and masterpiece!
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,"Literally every scene is treat to watch!great music,great acting great story and screenplay the camera moment are so smooth especially in bike chase.every moment in it is awesome and felt amazing the thrill will chill.its roller coaster ride starting intro,opera,bike chase,airplane scene,prime minister scene and the climax every thing is perfect and great!A masterpiece."
" It Had Some Good Ideas but where was the Execution? They should of tweaked some things. 🔧
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,5,"This Movie Had some Great Ideas but never really Capitalised on any of them.Examples:° 'The Syndicate' - Well where are they? All we see is some Block Headed Henchmen. I thought they Were Highly Trained Spies.° Lane's Master Plan at the End was A Superb Idea, he kept Ilsa around all that time but he needed her for that moment. Unfortunately the surrounding story was non existent and didn't feed into it, so that payoff was weaker than what it could of been.° The Underwater scene could of been way more intense but it was only ok.Parts of the Movie I did like:° The Opera Scene was Great° Ethan and the Prime Minister scene was Unexpected, so that was Good.° The Bike Chase.° The way they catch Lane.Stupid Parts:° The first scene where Ethan and Ilsa supposedly kill the henchmen. How? Maybe 2 of them could of been killed but what about the others?° The Knife Fight between Ilsa and Swedish Guy. Like Really? She was half his Size and he's a highly trained Spy.° The Swedish Guy misses all the shots fired at Ethan. Where is the Plausibility in some of this stuff?Overall, It was not good enough. Compared to Ghost Protocol it's very Inferior. Fallout Is the Greatest in my Opinion."
" Impossible not to like
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"Lots of good and enjoyable action, an easy to understand story and incredible stunt work from Tom Cruise proves he's even more than a successful actor."
" I do accept my mission
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"Mission: Impossible is one of the few franchises where it doesn't get worse every movie. It either stays about the same or gets better, depending on the movie. That being said, this is easily one of the best in the series. Knowing that Tom Cruise does his own stunts makes this movie so much cooler. There's scenes in here that are quite impressive. I won't say what they are though, because, spoilers. This reminded me of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The entire movie kept me engaged. There were hardly any boring scenes. It's exciting, and had done great twists. My only complaint is I found one scene quite predictable.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"
" Great entertainment
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,7,"With the only exception of the second part the Mission impossible franchise has always combined quality, action, good acting and especially an incredible amount of really good entertainment. This is another proof of that. I have seen all of them several times and as long as Mr Cruise is producing them I'm sure they will keep the level as good as it is now."
" Ethan Hunt on the run
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,7,"Rogue Nation sees Tom Cruise return, once again, as master spy extraordinaire Ethan Hunt. This time he's hunting the Syndicate, an international terrorist organization set on tearing down the modern society and building something new upon its ashes. Unfortunately, not even some of his allies believe that this organization even exists.The film continues to build upon the good things set up in its predecessors. It always feels like the stakes are just a bit higher, the cost of failure even harder to pay. But it's a slow enough ramp-up that we're nowhere close it being ludicrous yet. Suffice to say, I heavily enjoy Cruise in his role. I also really like Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner as his colleagues, and it was nice to see Ving Rhames return in a more substantial role.As for the new actors, there are two worth mentioning. Sean Harris as Solomon Lane and Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust. Harris's Lane is a tough contender for the best villain in the franchise, while Ferguson's Ilsa is just about the best thing in general in the franchise. Tough, no-nonsense spy, who's one of the few people that seem to be able to keep up with Hunt without much difficulty. It's fascinating seeing them work off one another. Luckily she returns in Fallout, because it would have been a real shame to lose her.That being said, I do miss the locations and the exotic tone of Ghost Protocol. Every single scene and each location in that film was iconic, which is unfortunately not something this film can say. It's still very good, but not masterful. Granted, the opera house scene is superb, but after that they get a lot duller. The action still works and the characters are amazing, it's simply that the locations aren't as memorable.Still, I'd say this easily qualifies as the second best film in the franchise. It's no Ghost Protocol, but then again, few things are."
" Mission Impossible
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,9,"Another energetic, pleasingly implausible through ride with Ethan hunt and company. This time he gets His best female rival/love interest since Emanuelle Beart in the original. Like in ghost protocol, the action is nearly nonstop but creatively drawn such as a hair-raising motorcycle chase and then under water infiltration that you don't feel like you're watching the same thing again and again. just throw out that my two and three and you've got one of the greatest action movie trilogies."
" Rogue Nation is a memorable flick that, on release, offered a measured alternative to the bloat of Spectre.
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,8,"It's as funny as Ghost Protocol, but in a more appropriate and less goofy way, it's villain, a chilling Sean Harris is a quiet sadist, cut from the cloth of MI:3's Owen Davian but less crash and brutish and bourgeoisie.
Rogue Nation starts cool and with a cool twist, it's got a little of the original's European spy flavour, it's just a shame that it's very expositiony and the same plot retreads of both Skyfall and Spectre. And like Ghost Protocol doing a retro throwback to the Cold War, Rogue Nation is doing a kind of retro Bondian supervilain plot we've seen before, McQuarrie clearly doing his Bond in case he never got a chance to (although after Fallout they'd probably let him).
Renner is actually good proving he'd be a better dramatic actor if used that way more often, Simon Pegg's Benji is a delight, a fountain of optimism and good acting. And Ilsa Faust is good punch of life to the franchise. Even though she's the right balance of badass and chic, it's a shame Paula Patton had to leave the franchise, I felt like she had more to give in a very different way.
Rogue Nation is a well edited and pretty film; with a crisp, filmic courtroom warmth and feel to the photography. It's kind of interesting as this is the first in the series to start mythologising Ethan Hunt, his reputation and legacy preceding him, his bouncy potentially indestructible nature. Veering into superhero.
The action is unfortunately mostly a little muddy and lacklustre except for a couple fights and a decent chase. McQuarrie as the series' first writer/director has made careful but edgy flick that tonally course corrects a mixed bag franchise with the same quality as the greats even if it's not with as much of a punch as 3.
Impossible Mission: I mean the Water tank is an easy choice, a set piece relatively quiet and alone, stakes simple to realise, easy to shoot and visually interesting with the grounding tension of the heartbeat to it. Except really the most Mission Impossible sequence has to be the opera; Not explicitly planned but definitely well executed. Lots of moving parts all seem to work well, McQuarrie using the timing of the opera itself and telegraphing the plot visually. And with a great solution to the dilemma. It really is a triumph of editing, scoring and sound editing."
" Same Plot Again
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,4,Another movie everyone in the world loves. I get it they need to get the disk and save everyone.
" The shortest Puccini opera ever.
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,9,"I thoroughly enjoyed Rogue Nation, as I enjoy all the films of this franchise (as I also loved the original TV series). I just had to say, though, watching it again OnDemand, that it contains what must be either the shortest version of Puccini's ""Turandot"" in opera history, or the longest, most drawn out assassination attempt. {: D Love it anyway."
" Turn off the brain, turn up the volume and watch the impossible...
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,7,"A really good follow-up film to M.I. Fantastic choreography and stunt work including possibly the fastest and most painful car chase ever, and a brutal and elegant knife fight.Long stretches of directorial brilliance and solid editing give you peeks into things you usually don't see but never enough to ruin the pounce or the sting. Good story, great scoring and a wonderful new characters. So much fun!"
" Just like previous movies!
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,7,"Lot of suspense and enjoyable to watch, just like other missions, predictable but still fun to watch , however, i do want to point something out since some scenes are filmed in Morocco (my country) , i do not know why they always try to show Morocco as just a desert!! In all hollywood movies, they try to show that Morocco is just a desert! The funny thing was that in this movie a desert was shown and then beneath it they wrote ""casablanca"" ! Is that a joke !! This is not casablanca!! The desert they showed is like 500 kilometers from casablanca!!"
" Overall success; Action for everyone!

" Everything you'd expect
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,7,"This was good, high quality as in budget and performances. You also know exactly what your getting going into #5, more of the same. A bit long winded at times, some of the scenes went on and on like the opera take down. I remember this from the last one too.Amazing stunts, and not just the famous Tom Cruise on the outside of the plane taking off but him shimmying up a pole while handcuffed and flipping over the top of it. Amazing motorcycle sequence too. The drowning one freaked me out. Simon Pegg was less annoying this time around, less buddy cop banter. Enjoyed the kick ass girl.This movie is a good time, everything you would be expecting from an MI movie. Why was Alec Baldwin in this?"
" Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015)
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,10,"Wow! This franchise just keeps getting better and better with every movie it releases. With elaborate storylines, and impressive stunts performed by lead, Tom Cruise and the cast, this franchise and this movie in particular, has taken action movies into a whole new level of seriousness and dedication. Especially with Christopher McQuarrie jumping in as the director, the movie was very well executed and put together in a proper and memorable way. Surely a must watch for all."
" Too much tedious talk and too little riveting action. The bad guy isnt menacing at all and the pretty girl, isnt very pretty. Bland formula edition, barely watchable.
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,4,"EVERY Mission Impossible edition needs a menacing bad guy. It needs a really oozing hot female enemy as well. But this movie is lacking in both of them, because the ""bad"" guy looks like an office clerk with a funny accent. And without a really menacing bad guy, there is NO sense of danger or excitement, which in effect causes this movie to be rather tedious and bland, the last thing I wish for in an action movie!The bad news doesnt stop here, because there is way too much talk going on. Just talk talk talk. 30 minutes of boring dialogue scenes could have easily been deleted. I mean this is suppose to be an action movie and the many talking scenes arent even suspenseful or funny. Just tedious and bland.Aint there any good? Well the few stunts / chase scenes are good and (reasonably) exciting. The fighting scenes are without real menace though. Still reasonably ok to watch for the first half, later on it really becomes slow. Watching Rogue Nation still beats staring at my wallpaper though..."

" You gotta love Tom cruise!!
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,7,The level of fitness Tom cruise has at his age is inspirational. Riding the motorcycle resembling MI2 is easily my favorite part of the movie.Story is simple and uncomplicated. Excellent action movie!!
" The time when IMF went bonkers
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,8,"It is unbelievable how the time flies and now I am watching the fifth part of Mission Impossible. This is one of those franchises that tries and succeeds in improving the experiences in every movie. With it being said I am taking a bit of a pause still remembering the opening sequence that topped everything that we have seen before.After the mind-blowing scene, the pace allows us to wrap our head around the plot and understand a new rogue threat that is standing on the way of peaceful existence. Love the old-school game of setting up the agents and playing hide and seek with authorities. Through this sneaky game we get to see that IMF has its nets set up almost everywhere that gives an impression of omnipotence of the agency.I undoubtedly adore the decisions of Christopher McQuarrie who so generously presented us with a ton of beautiful shots that charm and boost the piquancy of the scenes. The chase after the villain glues together like a beautiful paper model that is very fragile and has to be treated very carefully. This multi-act story keeps jumping from one place to another bringing one of the most intense scenes of Tom Cruise.The movie is just packed with action: if everything was put back to back than a vertigo would be a guaranteed outcome. However, the creators did their best to provide safe but exiting ride for you. With the old characters involved the feeling of nostalgia exults but then we get a few new faces as Rebecca Ferguson that stuns with both beauty and skill set; Sean Harris in his turn delivers cold and prudent approach to a masterplan while using his unforgettable voice.Not denying and certainly confirming my feelings, I will say that to my mind this part stays on the top of IMF adventures and shows other spy-action movies how it should be done. Definitely after such an impression I will wait for the next fantastic thing that Tom Cruise will think of and lets wish him luck in this phenomenal feat of bringing unbelievable realism to a viewer."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,7,Great movie with amazing action and numerous memorable scenes. lots of intense moments. a suspense thriller along with an action flick. Tom cruise's usual great acting and dangerous stunts. Renner boosts the acting credibility a bunch (2 viewings)
" Octane fun
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,9,"The latest instalment in the Mission Impossible franchise follows its impeccable trend to improve with time. Even when it didn't seem possible Rogue Nation out wits itself with a devastating amount of action and intelligent writing. The plot takes many twists and turns, its never difficult to follow yet a 2 hr movie feels like a 4 hr movie, not in a bad way either. It manages to pack such a detailed and analytical story into what could to prove the hollywood movie of 2015. Its smart, sophisticated, the action is brutal and plentiful. It has pretty much everything. It does cut out some of the humour but what it replaces it with is superb, the enemy feels threatening, you feel the magnitude and its oh so satisfying. Once more Tom Cruise is the consistent action hero who only becomes more likeable, he's backed up by brilliant on screen team as they pretty much blow us away. A note also to some sublime shots and editing in the most octane action sequences, they make the unbelievable seem believable and almost through the eyes of Ethan Hunt himself."
" The MI Franchise Just Keeps Getting Better!
",2019-06-07 00:00:00,8,"The Mission Impossible series has become one of the more popular action franchises of the last two decades, and to think they're going to kill off that cash cow now is laughable. We all know that in the end IMF will more than likely triumph, and most likely Ethan Hunt will emerge miraculously unharmed. Should this knowledge stop you from enjoying the film? Absolutely not. I still enjoy James Bond movies even though you can pretty much predict how things will play out every time. It's not the destination, it's the journey, and the journey through these movies is intense, insane, and altogether enjoyable. The Mission: Impossible movies have been fairly consistent in their quality (save M:I2). They're like James Bond minus the sexist womanizing and adding teamwork!"
" It is possible... better with age??
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,8,"Although I do not agree with Tom Cruises personal beliefs, he's a stellar actor, and this series just keeps getting better. The actors don't take themselves too seriously, the action is well done, and I'm impressed that Tom does his own stunts. I enjoy the banter between Tom, Simon, Ving, and Jeremy, it's a great counterbalance to the intense action sequences. Overall, it's really fun and highly enjoyable to watch, and has several twists. Even have to say the second and third viewings were great... and I think so much has to do with JJ Abrams' involvement... I do love anything he touches, such a genius!"
" ROGUE NATION
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,8,"The best thing about this movie is Rebecca Ferguson who plays Illsa Faust. She can hold her own in a scene with Tom Cruise and is incredibly beautiful, graceful, mysterious, and charismatic. Regular Cruise Collaborator Chris McQuarrie steps up to the plate to direct this one. He'd go on to helm the sequel FALLOUT. Before this he had written and produced Valkyrie, written Live Die Repeat and Ghost Protocol, and both written and directed Jack Reacher. He is closest in style to either Brad Bird or Brian De Palma. Bird in the way he continues with the same overall style and template that Bird had introduced, and like De Palma in that he is more of a classic kind of a filmmaker similar in many ways to Hitchcock as De Palma was. The movie kicks off and the fuse is lit with a breathtaking airplane stunt and then doesn't let go for the next 80 to 90 minutes. It slows down and gets a little clunky at the 90 minute point but picks up again for a great conclusion. Also Jeremy Renner's performance was a little...goofy at times and he was slightly under utilized. But overall Its one of the better, possibly even the best Mission: Impossible as a whole. The set pieces and action scenes are all memorable, Rebecca Ferguson is a fantastic addition and maybe the best character in the series, the music by Joe Kraemer is very good, better than Lorne Balfe's in Fallout for sure. Tom Cruise kind of screwed up the awesome haircut tradition of the series (switching from short on the odd numbered films to long in the even) in this one and I'm not a huge fan of his decision to sport a haircut that's basically neither. Kind of on the longer side, but who really cares. I notice this is a Mission I come back to almost more than any of the others. Its got a great style, tone, and its a lot of fun."
" Even Better Than Ghost Protocol
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,9,"Given the critical and commercial success that Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol enjoyed a few years ago, it was inevitable that Cruise would be back for another instalment of the franchise. And so once again it's up to Ethan Hunt to save the world from international terrorists. And this time he'll be doing it as Washington's most wanted man.Hardly has the movie even begun before Impossible Missions Force is disbanded and absorbed by the CIA, which promptly declares Hunt a rogue agent and orders him brought in. So with the CIA's best men on his trail, and precious little intel to help him, he has to track down and dismantle the shadowing international terrorist group known only as the Syndicate. A group that knows far more about him than he does about it. These are long odds even for Hunt, but then doing the impossible is his business.His best hope lies with Ilsa Faust, a former British agent with connections to the Syndicate and a seeming attraction to him. Played by the beautiful Rebecca Ferguson, she is a very interesting character. She's smart, seductive, and very good in a fight, but you never can tell who's side she's on, if anyone's. It's clear that she has her own agenda and it's hard to tell if anything she's saying is the truth. But she's the closest thing Ethan has to an ally, and he can't seem to resist the allure of a dangerous woman in need of help.The plot is surprisingly smart for a summer popcorn flick, with sudden twists and reversals worthy of a recent Bond or Batman movie. Of course both the good guys' and bad guys' plans are excessively complicated and their success relies on a degree of timing and luck that would be impossible in real life, but who really cares? The action and plot twists are so tautly paced and slickly executed that suspension of disbelief is never a problem. It is a bit tedious how quickly the movie resorts to the clichéd plot device of the incompetent/corrupt CIA, but thankfully that ends up going in an entirely different direction than expected, with major narrative and comedic payoff.The action is of course excellent, with well-staged shootouts and car chases aplenty, and an opening sequence that would do a Bond movie proud. It also goes without saying that there is plenty of the high suspense the series is known for, especially in the obligatory high tech infiltration scene. And lest things get too serious, the tension is balanced by a great deal of very effective comic relief. Simon Pegg is hilarious as always as Benjie, Hunt's high strung and not entirely field capable tech specialist; his reactions shots during the Moroccan car chase are absolutely priceless. Nor is the movie afraid to score laughs at its star's expense, even poking subtle fun at Cruise's limited stature. With its ever present sense of humor and occasionally self-deprecating tone, the MI franchise is well on its way to establishing itself as the lighter alternative to the current Bond series.All in all, Rogue Nation is stylish, smart, and self aware, with just the right blend of adrenaline, suspense, and humor. Between this film and Ghost Protocol, I'd say that Cruise, director Christopher McQuarrie, and Paramount have perfected their formula for wildly entertaining spy thrillers. Here's looking forward to the next installment."
" Almost Became a Parody of Itself
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,7,"4 August 2015. The disastrous opening almost verged into a poor, imitation, parody of Mission Impossible with dumbed down comic dialogue and less than interesting action set up that lacked the James Bond punch. The movie then settles somewhat uneasily into a comical version of itself and eventually focuses on the more serious action thriller that the franchise is known for. Nevertheless, Rogue Nation never quite achieves the sophisticated, consistent thrill plot outline that eerie, creepy Sherlock Holmes (2009) was able to create and enrapture and ensnare its audience with. Rogue Nation does hit some high notes in its vicarious chase scenes on motorcycles and uses nice psychological twists of betrayal. Alec Baldwin is severely underused as the CIA head as compared with The Bourne Identity franchise series. The plot seems choppy and the script is blatantly manipulative in is In some ways the television scripts of Leverage is able to be smartly portrayed in one hour episodes that that rival the fun cerebral elements that Rogue Nation attempted but was unable to accomplish."
" Quick Review
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,9,"Even after M:I 3 and M:I Ghost Protocol (both directed by favorite directors of mine) I wasn't there for the franchise. But this one! This one made me love the series.The action was just amazing, the performances by everyone were top notch and the music was out of this world! The only thing I didn't love was the character of the ""bad guy"" but even that one wasn't bad!Totally recommend this one to any cinefil out there and especially to anyone who likes action!"

" An adrenaline rush right from the beginning
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,8,"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is an adrenaline rush right from the beginning. It features so many fun gadgets and impressive stunt sequences that you don't really care when the story requires a suspension of disbelief. This movie doesn't take itself seriously, and that is why it succeeds. After all, this franchise isn't about realism, it's about accomplishing the impossible and looking cool while doing it."
" A SOLID SUCCESSOR
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,8,"While ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is not as good as ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol,"" it is still a great follow up thanks to the great acting, story, stunts and the addition of Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust"
" A solid entry in the MI series; a stunning action movie.
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,10,"ROGUE NATION has a lot of excellent action sequences which make it one of the best action movies of all time. Tom Cruise drives all the action with energy, while Christopher McQuarrie directs with full intensity. Rebecca Ferguson is a worthy inclusion in the cast. She excels in the action sequences, making her one of the top action heroines in today's times. The entire cast acts with the same energy and intensity. Action sequences elevate the film to a higher level. The chase sequences are so breakneck that you'd have to be an ignorant viewer not to like them. There are good twists as well, and the scale is huge as always. The MI franchise has always improved on the next film, and this one proves me right."
" Almost perfect.
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,8,"I really liked this installment. It is almost perfect. The action is spot on, the actors are ok. I was not impressed by Alex. Why is he playing a nudge again? Also, Jeremy Renner never impressed me. 2 major irks. 1. The actor who plays Lane. EXTREMELY ANNOYING VOICE. 2. Bing should have been in the movie from the start. Benjiy is great."
" A great spy adventure
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,9,"A great spy adventure with lots of thrilling stunts and set pieces, novel gadgets and an interesting plot full of misdirection. Entertaining throughout thanks to its top stunts, well placed comical moments, strong characters and throw backs to the source material. Some parts are too cliché and it does slow down too much when there isn't excitement on screen, but it's still a lot of fun."
" Seminar me of an old James Bond
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,7,For some reason brings back memories of the old James Bond movies with better stunts of course but the tone and the predictability is similar. Including the usual defusing of the nuclear bombs in the last second.
" From the scribe of The Usual Suspects comes one of Mission Impossible's finest.
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,9,"Rogue Nation is an endlessly amusing spy-fi flick from America's equivalent to the James Bond franchise. Mission Impossible has always managed to show entertaining international capers that defy real-world logic but not to the detriment of the final product. Tom Cruise reprises his iconic Super-Spy in Ethan Hunt and he's still an all-American master of espionage and saving the world from anarchy: which this guy basically eats for breakfast.Ethan Hunt has to save the world once again, this time from former MI6-agent-turned-terrorist, Solomon Lane. This time Ethan will need the help of a part-time hero and part-time villainess in Ilsa Faust: a spiritual Bond-girl who leaves many of the real and recently seen Bind-girls to shame. This film delivers the seamless action-thriller experience and story that James Bond's Spectre failed to deliver (at least in comparison to that series' masterful predecessor Skyfall), and I reckon it's great that there are two great franchises in the spy-fi field that have basically become equals in the entertainment industry: Mission Impossible and James Bond. Rogue Nation shows that the Mission Impossible series still has many action-packed stories to tell through Ethan Hunt.Rogue Nation shows that the franchise still has boat-loads of cinematic fun left to have and it's only going to get bigger and bigger. Thankfully that proved to be the case with this film's sequel: Mission Impossible: Fallout. However, Rogue Nation is perfectly self-contained entertainment in and of itself anyway. Give this one a shot: it's action-adventure ecstasy in its purest form. Rogue Nation gets a rock-solid 4.5/5 stars."
" Mission imterrible.
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,1,"The pacing was too fast in this movie. Weak story told.1. Pointless beginning, it seemed as though it was just there to show Ethan hanging on the plan.2. Lane character is so trash, we see him do nothing in the film.3. We see the syndicate do nothing4. Nevermind."
" Finally a good story for a new Misson Impossible
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,9,"It's fair to say some of the previous Misson Impossibles have had thin to very weak stories in the past. We can all be forgiven for thinking the franchise is about cutting edge stunts and impossible feets. Well as of rogue nation, the franchise has upped its game. This film finally brings a detailed believable antagonist in and a great back story with it. The opening scenes are incredible to watch and the plot thickens with intrigue rather than confusion (rabbits foot nonsense of the past). This film seems to be less about Ethan Hunt and more about the team against a common enemy. Funny in places and with a real sense of adversarial toughness. If you like action, you like a good well explained story and twists and turns along the way, you will not be disappointed. One of the best films I have seen in a while and certainly the best Mission Impossible since the first."
" Lacks an identity
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,5,"One of the aspects of the Mission: Impossible franchise that really helps separate it from the conveyor belt of action/spy/thriller movies that hit our cinema screens and streaming services every year is the idea of introducing a new director for each new entry. Such an approach helps prevent fatigue from Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt and whatever team he assembles, and gives each film its own feel without disrupting the flow of the series. Brian De Palma riddled his movie with unbearable moments of tension, while John Woo favoured slow-motion gunplay. J.J. Abrams introduced a darker tone to the proceedings, only for Brad Bird to lighten the tone while packing more of a physical punch. They aren't all great, but you can at least recognise a style. Christopher McQuarrie was the choice to envision part five, and with him he brings a bland, by-the-numbers style that infected his previous movie, the Tom Cruise vehicle Jack Reacher.What also has helped this series to survive over the years are set-pieces built around real stunts and genuine danger. In this regard, Rogue Nation doesn't disappoint, although it clearly blows its load far too early. If you've seen the trailer, you'll know the film's signature jaw-dropping moment involves Tom Cruise clinging to the side of a plane as it takes off, the ground behind him shrinking rapidly with each passing second. Simon Pegg's Benji Dunn frantically bashes an iPad while Jeremy Renner's returning William Brandt barks panicked directions over loud-speaker, and it's all edited to guarantee maximum thrills. In fact, the entire first half of the film manages to maintain this exciting pace, delivering a high speed motorcycle chase and a stealthy mission in the Vienna Opera House. Plot has never been the strong suit of this franchise, and things grind to a halt when McQuarrie decides to slow things down for the finale. A plot involving the kidnapping of 'the British Prime Minister' (played by Tom Hollander) and a shadowy organisation called The Syndicate are plot devices straight out of James Bond, and it often feels like Rogue Nation is simply trying to be America's version of Britain's most popular fictional spy.McQuarrie does have some aces hidden up his sleeve however, and the biggest of these is Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, a fellow spy working within the Syndicate for her own dubious reasons. While her character shares no chemistry with her lead co-star, she makes a fantastic impression in the action stakes as she repeatedly crosses paths with Hunt, and hordes of bad guys, in the field. Cruise does share great chemistry with Simon Pegg however, and although the Shaun of the Dead star is little more than comic relief and the guy who can push a few buttons on his laptop and open any door in the world, his screen time with Cruise helps to humanise Hunt, which is important in a universe looking to turn its hero into an unstoppable super agent. It's a perfectly passable two hours, but will likely fade from memory mere seconds after the credits have rolled. Unlike the lit fuse during the opening credits, Rogue Nation fails to explode into life, fizzling out when the film starts to think that this series can be anything more than a bunch of people chasing a McGuffin and having to retrieve a few things in spectacular fashion along the way. Woo's effort remains the worst in the series, but Rogue Nation lacks an identity. While the first hour is certainly fun, it often feels like McQuarrie is auditioning for a different franchise altogether."
" This series gets better as it progresses.
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,8,"Since Christopher McQuarrie has become the director,Mission Impossible has got cooler. Mission Impossible I And II are not spy movies. J.J Abrams' and Christopher McQuarrie's are spy movies. I'm looking forward to watching Fall Out."
" Moments of deeper intrigue complement the expectedly amazing action
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,8,"A ridiculous, fantastic opening sequence with Cruise's all-in-all-the-time Hunt (""I'm not in the plane, I'm ON the plane!"") sets the stage for another wonderful batch of thrilling action that is just so insane and entertaining and well-made that you often forget what the plot is in the midst of it-and this time around the plot has its moments of deeper intrigue and character nuance (Ilsa's a nice addition here, sans those gratuitous bod shots) like M:I 1, so it's not like that's not saying much.

" Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,8,"Fairly silly but charming. Though, to be honest, Tom Cruise seemed off of his game."
" Compelling sequel
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,8,"The MIF team once again have to go rogue because the CIA threaten to shut them down. But it's down to Ethan Hunt and his team to bring down the shady terrorist organisation known as the Syndicate who have caused death and destruction in the past. Tom Cruise returns for the 5th entry in the series along with actors Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Jeremy Renner. Rebecca Ferguson makes her debut in the franchise and she has some great scenes from her well choreographed fight scenes to her mysterious demeanour. Jeremy Renner is underused here but he is nevertheless great in the film. Simon Pegg gets some good scenes, his story arc is one of best as he gets put in some sticky situations. He's been a true asset to the team in recent years and it shows a more dramatic side to him. Not to say he doesn't have some funny scenes because he does but they are more subtle and well suited to his character. Simon Pegg needs to be in more serious roles in the future because he's sort of type cast as a comedy actor. Sean Harris is the cold hearted villain pulling the strings. He doesn't get much screen time however he's the best villain since Phillip Seymour Hoffman.Directed by Christopher McQuarrie who does an impressive job taking the franchise to more serious levels. It's a film adults will enjoy more so than the kids. It's more darker than the previous film, a lot smarter with no annoying comedic characters, has a lot less CGI and just feels like a genuine Mission Impossible film. The franchise has been going for 20 years and they have somehow managed to make each film progressively better. It's on the same level as the underrated Mission Impossible III which was a very grounded film with realistic characters and great acting but at the same time keeps the elements what made the 1996 original so great. Much like the very first film it's focused on a compelling story and has some gripping scenes. The only problem is it runs at a slow pace sometimes because the plot isn't always engaging. Even though there are plenty of action scenes to feast on they are very minimal. It's biggest action scene is used in the opening where Tom Cruise clings onto a plane taking off (which of course he actually performed this stunt himself). The cinematography is a bit dark but there are so many memorable shots.There are a lot of dramatic scenes throughout from an opera assassination attempt to an underwater vault heist. It has an exciting chase sequence throughout the streets of Morocco but it does a fine job mixing the action, drama and suspense which is a refreshing approach to the genre. Nowadays film studios take the easy way out with their action/comedy plots which lack drama. 
With Rogue Nation it's very clear that they put the plot before the action. It's intriguing and full of interesting unpredictable characters. The ending is so well done, it's clever with a lot of surprises and doesn't just throw in the standard action packed ending we usually see in these films."
" Rating: A-
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,8,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Christopher McQuarrie is able to create a film with the best qualities of its predecessors. The high levels of tension and suspense of M:I-1 and the non-stop action of M:I-3 are very well-balanced in Rogue Nation, which makes it another success inside an already fantastic saga. The action continues to be the highlight since Tom Cruise's mission apparently is to try and perform as many death-or-life situations as he can.The plane sequence is riveting, the underwater set piece is (literally) breathtaking and the chasing scenes, whether on foot or by car or by a motorcycle, are incredibly exciting. McQuarrie directs the hell out of those scenes with an unique camera work, some beautiful cinematography, and seamless editing. The score is once again brilliant and it helps giving me some goosebumps.The screenplay is captivating and it finally has another decent villain to rival with Philip Seymour Hoffman of the third installment. Sean Harris portrays Solomon Lane and, even though Lane isn't exactly an extremely well-written antagonist, at least he has clear motivations and a lot more screentime than other villains throughout the series. Still, he could have been better explored.The new additions to the cast are sensational. Rebecca Ferguson brilliantly interprets Ilsa Faust, who has some great development along the runtime. Alec Baldwin (Alan Hunley) is also a great addition to the saga. I love that they decided to use Ving Rhames' character, Luther, more in this movie. He only had a tiny bit at the end of Ghost Protocol, so I am delighted to see him back on screen with his fantastic humor. Simon Pegg (Benji) is also becoming one of my favorite characters and Pegg proves that he can also accomplish some great dramatic scenes besides the frequent comic relief moments.Finally, Jeremy Renner (William Brandt) continues to be an awesome actor by portraying a possible substitute of Ethan Hunt in the future of the franchise (even if I doubt that Renner would do all the crazy stuff Cruise does). Obviously, Tom Cruise is the standout with all of his jaw-dropping real stunts that most people don't even believe they are actually true. I bet that at least 7 out of 10 people that watched this movie at the time of its release, didn't believe for a single moment that the airplane scene was real ... This is saying a lot about the quality of the stunt team and the unbelievable courage of Cruise. Please, never stop doing this!My only big issue with the movie is its pacing. Even though it gives more time for the audience to rest between action sequences, it becomes too much espionage exposition and it slightly becomes a bit boring. The tone is well-balanced, but the pacing really does not help at all the overall flow of the film. This aspect plus the not-that-great villain bring the movie a bit down for me but it is still right among the best in the franchise.All in all, Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation provides the entertainment that the audience expects from it. Tom Cruise proves once again why he is an icon in action movie history with mind-blowing stunts and McQuarrie is able to elevate the levels of tension and suspense in the already fantastic action set pieces. Beautiful-looking and with a perfect score, a captivating story and a brilliant cast, filled with compelling characters. Definitely, one of the best of the saga."
" Can't decide if ""Ghost Protocol"" or this is the best
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,8,"""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is everything you would expect from a ""Mission: Impossible"" film. Great action set pieces and locations. And Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) running. Boom bow! Mission: Go watch it!"
" Fallout
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,9,"Just came out of the cinema watching Mission Impossible Fallout. From beginning to end, enjoyed it, very satisfying and entertaining to watch. I would never think I would say this, but Fallout is my new favorite when it comes to Mission Impossible. It's clever, realistic, cool and a great synergy to the entire series. I've watched all Mission Impossible movies in my time. In order to get more understanding at what's playing in the story it's good to watch part 5, Rogue Nation if you haven't done already. You'll get to enjoy it a bit more that way, I think.Let's talk content.Things I liked about Mission Impossible Fallout, including small references:Vhing Rames is back as Luther, that feels good. Has been in every Mission Impossible movie part of the team, except for part 4, Ghost Protocol, you only see him at the end of the movie there.Benjii gets more action, in the beginning and end. It's good to see he's knows his way around gun while still being the clever cool nerd of the team.Ethan climbs a small surface up on a mountain at the end of the movie. I couldn't help think about the first scene in Mission Impossible 2, where he also does it without climbing gear for the cool opening intro there.The action overall in Fallout is realistic. I really love how they shot the angles for certain scenes, Ethan on the motor in Paris, it gets you more drawn into it all. The way Luther explains how Ethan really only cared about two woman in his entire life to Ilsa felt and looked really good, I think it added a good layer to the story. I've never seen Henry Cavill play a bad guy. He does a surprising good job on that! I've seen him play angry superman in Justice League for a scene there, but that doesn't really count for me. Julia makes a surprising appearance at the end of the movie and even plays a small part in helping the team. The acting felt natural and good around Julia and Ethan. Ethans look when he sees Julia in the camp is really surprised, that looked real good! Besides that it's kind of nice to see that Ethan has a love interest in Ilsa.I think I'm going to watch to this for a second time in the cinema, that's how much I enjoyed it.I give Fallout a 9 out of 10."
" Not as good as MI Ghost Protocol
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,5,I found this movie to be boring compared to Ghost Protocol which I watched on FX right before this. The action scenes were boring too. I plan on seeing MI Fallout in a theater soon and hopefully that's better than this is.
" Raises the bar in terms of stunt-work and palpable action-sequences.
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,9,"'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015)' introduces a new level of palpability and is responsible for the whole series' retroactive, but slightly unwarranted, reputation for tangible, essentially 'real' stunt-work, thanks to its many fantastic set-pieces built solely around the slightly insane idea of Tom Cruise being as close to death as possible every moment he's on screen. This is really the reason why the film works so well and is as purely exciting as it is, as it always feels absolutely authentic and manages to keep the audience as engaged as possible with both its action and the characters caught up in it. It's interesting that each film in the series has significantly raised the bar in terms of action, and this is no exception. Thus far, the sequences in this picture are possibly the best in the series: fast, frenetic and fantastically composed. They're all very well conceived, crafted to be as exciting as possible. There's an ever-so-slightly darker tone this time, though things aren't dour and moments of levity are used to great effect. This vibe is bolstered by a smaller but seemingly more personal plot, which sticks closely to the roots of the franchise but does avoid many of its predictabilities. It's certainly an ensemble piece, as much as its direct predecessor. It has possibly the best cast in the entire series, and the most focus on them. All the core players are given several moments to shine, which means that you understand and care about them all. The momentum of the piece is kept thoroughly forward-moving without ever compromising on the character moments that make the narrative so impactful. The movie really is just incredibly entertaining when it gets going. 9/10"
" Strictly formulaic but plenty of surprise and thrills
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,7,"An American action spy fantasy thriller. A story about a team of American secret agents who face being shut down when the head of the CIA convinces the US Senate that they are too dangerous. The operatives defy orders and plot to bring down a shadowy society of assassins.
This fifth installment opens to one of the most thrilling pre-credit sequences of not just the film series but the action genre entire. There is no substitute for live action groundbreaking stuntwork and Cruise's determination to make the film do what it says on the tin - the impossible - is laudable. Simon Pegg is back in a larger supporting role as chatterbox analyst. He provides much of the humour, gluing Cruise's death defying escapes and scrapes together so things don't become too serious. Dressed-to-Kill British agent Rebecca Ferguson provides the athleticism and beauty and steals not only Cruise's gizmos but also some of his scenes. Sean H's villain is suitably quirky and menacing and guides the tension in climactic scenes.
There are a few false notes e.g. that an Austrian Chancellor isseems less important than the British PM, and the sequence at a Viennese opera resembles Quantum of Solace's right down to the detail. All in all, a good action-adventure with thrilling motorcycle sequences and death defying aerial stunts, and on those elements its hard to say which is the better, Rogue Nation or its sequel."
" Midly entertaining but also irritating.
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,5,"The best thing about the movie were the European locations. The movie is almost non-stop action and yet there was very little suspense. No doubt the direction was poor, but also the characters are invulnerable, there is never any doubt they will prevail.
Pegg was the comic relief but he always seems a bit forced to me. Like the bloke who played the Hobbit.
I never could buy the scientologist weirdo Cruise as an action guy, he's a pint pot mid-life crisis pretty boy. I was wondering how much this movie would be improved without him, he just seems to be on an ego trip.
Then there is the typical hollywood mythological woman who can kill assassins at will just by wrapping her legs around their necks. Yeah right. You might knock a gun out their hands, but they will have another gun, and you would be dead. And even if a knife fight - no chance.
Plus the plot holes and discontinuities are everywhere. The plans these guys have rely on million-to-one coincidences to work! The things these guys do really are impossible.
And of course, you're dealing with a world where there is zero security, the heroes can access and wonder around anywhere with impunity.
All this means that you're just watching set-pieces that you've seen before, only done better.
I was not expecting better, I just watch daft movies from time to time to see what modern block-buster making looks like.
And the fake positive reviews on this site - oh my!"
" The consolidation of the greatest action franchise in movie history
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,10,"You may have a different franchise as your all time favorite action one, but you have to admit, no other as come this far, with this quality (hi, Die Hard). This is the FIFTH film of the saga, and it might be the best one.I just love, the way they have reinvented the franchise, and turned into a pure episodic, fun, and engaging adventure (aside from the CRAZINESS that is the technical aspect here). I could easily watch a new Mission Impossible movie ever 3 years for the next 20 years. The sad thing is, that Tom Cruise is mortal, so, he probably won't be doing this stuff 20 years from now. But man, what a franchise, and what a movie.It's amazing how this movie is able to mix the tense ""vibe"" from the first one (something that MI3 and 4 weren't able to do), with the frenect and gorgeous action scenes from its two predecessors.The movie starts by just knocking out of the park, with an incredible airplane sequence, that is also extremely funny (another hit, that started with Ghost Protocol).The main cast is probably the best assemble on the franchise. Even though Paula Patton is great in MI4, Rebecca Ferguson simply DESTROYS in this movie. She is sexy as hell, but also a f#cking badass character, you can in the same scene fall in love with her, but also be frecking scared. She is just fantastic. Jeremy Renner is a win too, he was great in Ghost Protocol, and I was glad they brought him back. Bring Ving Rhames back was another thing they got it right, the guy has so much chemistry with the whole cast (mainly with Cruise). And, well, do I really need to talk about Simon Pegg and Tom Cruise? Pegg is such a talent actor, he is charismatic, funny, and every other compliment you can think of, he is just amazing.And Tom Cruise... man, I don't even know what else I can say about him, the guy is a monster, a movie legend. Not only he is a great actor (like, with actual acting skills), but man, his commitment with this franchise is something unique, and is so great to see scenes that are performed by the actor (not an stuntman) and also shot in a real location. The same thing Keanu Reeves or Jack Chan do with their fight scenes, Cruise does here with those big action sequence. It's fantastic. Again, say what you have to say about the guy, but you have to admit that this is frecking awesome.And, for me what makes this one competes with MI3 for the spot of the best one of the five, is that even the biggest problem that this franchise has had for the last 20 years doesn't show up here. The villain is actually pretty decent. He has enough back story, a great performance by Sean Harris, and you know, is decent overall, not a great villain, but a good one, that doesn't holds the movie back.The story is engaging, an almost ""classic"" rogue organization story, that you saw before in other movies (a couple of Bond ones, for example), but this is fine. A movie not always need to reinvent the genre (in a storytelling perspective), if are into the characters, it's enough (and hell yeah, this is definitely the case here). The end is really clever though, a finale without a ""huge action outcome"", cause we already had that throught the movie, so is fun to be surprised by it (also, it's another caracteristic that was brought back from the first movie. Really cool).To conclude, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation is a fantastic movie, not only for those casual moviegoers but also for all the hardcore movie fans, that want to analyse it deeply. Definitely a must-see one for any action fans out there.Updated on July 19th, 2020: At first I had given the movie a 9/10, but I just can't not give it a 10/10. I love this movie, and I feel the urge to re watch it every single year since it came out. It's funny, is thrilling, is gorgeous, and it's one of my favorite action films of all time."
" Confident in Time and Space
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,10,"The movie Mission Impossible :Rogue Nation is the culmination of several resources like the capacity to achieve, cinematography, directorial and casting members because not to mention the absent members is truthful in it's lingering effect. 
The movie sold tickets and the news papers were awaiting Rogue Nation eagerly but the results of a well made made movie did not surprise the underachievers in us and the film won budget rather than awards. The mission has an objective like a gun with a trigger; point and shoot for safety like at a trial area. 
Safety about our lives are the approach that cinema has taken towards the turn of the century with countries far behind in the third and fourth world who are yet to access or not access the footage according to their whereabouts in the entire globe. 
Awards are yet to be had over popularity of this franchise whose tunes are downloaded from i Tunes and can be heard online. The tunes are from this series can be identified to our senses but it remains your choice whether to act upon the music or not. 
Talked about Feature Film starring Tom Cruise."
" Domestication, Mass Production and Marketing of the Tobacco Plant
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,1,"Nicotine is a mild diverse psychoactive drug. Scientific, technological, and commercial ingenuity and innovation resulted in production of sufficient quantities of nicotine to satisfy public demand. The demand was so great because psychotropic drugs assuage fear(aka tension, stress, anxiety)and prop up ego. ALSO THE SHORT TERM SIDE EFFECTS WERE NEGLIGIBLE. Do you wonder what might be discovered if a few hundred mil develop a 2 pack a day THC habit? But the question here is why do people give a damn about cgi and comic book characters literal or virtual? No relevance to their lives. Just pretty colors and bright shiny objects? It assuages fear and supports ego. Thinly disguised mild paganism with negligible short term side effects."
" Mission Impossible Rogue Nation Review
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,9,"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is a film co-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. After the exciting 4th instalment, I was pumped up for this one. And it again just delivers spot-on.Plot: Ethan Hunt and his IMF team are against a rogue organisation, termed as the Syndicate who would wipe anyone out of their way to achieve their objective.Story and direction: Chris McQuarrie and Drew Pearce (co-writer) infuse their new and vibrant energy into this franchise because of which it never feels old or run out of fuel. The story is very impressive and I liked the way the film covered the previous 4 installments. I would not be wrong saying that this film was teased during the last moments of the last part. I think the makers were going in for an arc spanning 2-3 films. But that doesn't mean the film doesn't stand on its own. It does and very beautifully. There are certain characters that are stretched and explored more which I liked. Even the new characters don't seem disposable and bring a lot to the film. The action scenes are just great and never feel over the top (especially the car and bike chase set in Morocco). The VFX of the film also does wonders and adds to the beauty of the film. The music by Joe Kraemer impresses on various levels. The cinematography and editing are top-notch. The film faltered only on one aspect: the climax. Normally, I do expect the M;I finale to be a big blast and full of tension creating adrenaline moments. But here I felt the film was going the expected way and I wasn't surprised. It felt very ordinary. Maybe FALLOUT will explain those events.Performances: Tom Cruise is as usual in his best and gives a great performance. His dedication to his work and especially towards the action scenes is always felt. Jeremy Renner contributes to the film in his own special way. I liked Simon Pegg's character being more dramatic than of a comic relief. Rebecca Ferguson brings in new energy to the films and I can't wait to see her in FALLOUT. So does Alec Baldwin. Sean Harris's portrayal of Solomon Lane was kind of different and I liked the way he was characterized.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Benji confronts Ethan about Ethan sending him back to DC and Benji saying that he should be with Ethan since they are a team. This has an effect on me as it showed a different side of Benji which I never expected. Also, shown so beautifully is Ethan's concern for others.Verdict: ROGUE NATION has added another fun-filled, action-thriller ride to the M: I Series. I had a fun time with the entire series. Just waiting for FALLOUT to come. Can't wait for it.I am going with a 9/10."
" It really is you
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,10,"Ethan (Tom Cruise) is up against the Syndicate (Sean Harris) and fights to take them down. He is aided by Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, and Ving Rhames. Rebecca Ferguson is the femme fatale whose loyalty changes with every scene. In this installment the entire world is after Ethan as he tries to save it.While I rated this film 5 stars, on the Mission Impossible franchise scale, I consider this to be the least entertaining of the series, like Hobbit as compared to Lord of the Rings. It is more entertaining than what is out there, but not as entertaining as when compared to itself. The action wasn't as adrenaline filled as previous films. Ethan escapes mundane death maybe seven-eight times in this film and on a paltry three continents. While I love Ving Rhames in ""B"" films one has to ask where was Morgan Freeman?Another criticism I have, as previous films, was the limited use of the adrenaline pumping Mission Impossible theme song. Instead they would take a rift and incorporate into some sort of spy/Bond music. It was as if they were letting me taste it, and then they rip it out of my mouth.Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Rebecca Ferguson naked back. Killings and explosions, nothing graphic. Heck, most of the bullets that land are knock out darts."
" So many blatant plugs for companies, hilarious
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,1,"Take a notepad and start accounting for every company and brand name you see. The amount of ads in this movie are mind-blowing. They even plugged a military cargo jet by Airbus, that's how shameless this film was.This really is the Mission Impossible that showed they have run out of ideas. It's probably time to reboot with a new lead . It's for the best. This was hard to get through, it really was."
" Pulls off the Impossible by being better than all the rest that came before it!
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,10,"Christopher Macquarie has written and directed the most tightly-plotted and incredible in this successful franchise. It's no surprise that he is the only director that has been invited back to script and direct the next one as well. Mission Impossible pits Ethan Hunt against an enemy that is cold, calculative and brilliant. And to watch the cat and mouse game played out between the two makes for a tense and thrilling time at the movies. The ending is better than the previous installments because it is not over-the-top, but rather it comes down to a clever examination of what makes Ethan Hunt fundamentally different from his enemy at the core of their values. What is perceived as Ethan's weakness (of caring too much about his team) actually becomes the master-stroke in how he manages to defeat his most cunning enemy. Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation gives us one of the best villains in the spy thriller genre, not to mention one of the best female characters who is complex and keeps us guessing to the end. Highly recommended!"
" Exceeding Expectations
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,10,"Jam packed with action, comedy, and tables turned around every corner. Exciting to watch and an outstanding score of 5 stars deserved. Absolutely recommended to watch. This franchise has hit its peak and now is set sail for the sky.
-TE (8.5.15)"
" This series is consistently awesome!
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,9,"Ok, that's not entirely true. I wasn't a huge fan of the first one, so all of these movies are better than the first. The last 2 in particular have stepped up the action and comedy quite a bit! A must see, and I'm excited for the new one in the theatre. This one has some particularly tense moments, especially the underwater portion."
" A masterpiece of mission impossible franchise
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,10,"Having followed them all through these years and liked each and every one of them, this one in my opinion is the best of them all for small simple reasons.
It showcases the use of technology briefly and efficiently without emphasizing much on them, it is action packed true to the core of the franchise in all the missions and fighting sequences but most importantly it perfectly shows how truly smart Ethan is with the backup plans the wit and his value as the mission impossible agent. Plus the writing and the flow of the movie was so enjoyable."
" Of Thinly Disguised Identities.
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,2,"These fracnhises have replaced the weejkkly adventure series on televvision. It doesn't matter who the stars are or what the plot is. Everything and everyone are replaceable. Okay, Connery and Stallone are out, but Damon and Cruise are now in. No more SMERSH but then we have ""The Syndicate."" If there are any consistent themes, they are advanced technology and the superior combat skills of the protagonist. Well, I suppose there are other iterated shots at a more molecular level -- an armed man is fighting an unarmed man and there is a shot of the weapon skidding across the floor; one combatant slams his forehead against that of the other and disables him, and to hell with Newton; a shoe stomps on the accelerator cut to a tire burning rubber and raising a cloud of dust. This film as at least one example of each cliché. It's just added evidence that the fall of civilization is at hand.Here's another I'll throw in for the cognocenti among us. An assassination attempt -- mostly out of Hitchcock's ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" -- takes place during an opera. It's ""Madam Butterfly."" Now guess which aria you're going to hear. At least no one will sleep during the bullets and acrobatics. The villainous organization here has no particular plan in mind. It's not an underground nest of rich Nazis or rabid drug dealers. It's only purpose, we're told, is to ""destroy the system that created it."" Right. You can watch it if you like. Personally, these sequels drain me of energy in the way that Hollywood has been drained of imagination."
" Another fun M:I movie
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,8,"I'm really glad the franchise is still going. This was yet another action-packed movie from the series.There are some fantastic, creative scenes shot inside the Vienna Opera House, and an awesome underwater scene later on in the movie. Great to see some returning cast members as well."
" THANKS TOM!
",2018-02-16 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the best 'thrillers' of all time in the true sense of the word, and the best written story in the series. Thanks Tom and company for showing that teamwork can work wonders!"
" Time for a Rethnk?
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,6,"""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is the fifth instalment in the long-running ""Mission: Impossible"" series. It shows the obvious influence of the even-longer-running Bond series. All the films in these two franchises involve Our Hero, named either James Bond or Ethan Hunt, travelling around the world with a glamorous female sidekick to various exotic foreign locations, performing various feats of improbable (not to say impossible) derring-do in an attempt to thwart the evil schemes of some dastardly individual or organisation. ""Rogue Nation"" fits this template more or less exactly. Hunt, accompanied by his glamorous female sidekick Ilsa Faust, travels to Minsk, Vienna, Havana, Morocco and London, performing various feats of derring-do along the way, in an attempt to thwart the evil schemes of the Syndicate, a mysterious terrorist group. Those schemes include the assassination of various world leaders, including the Austrian Chancellor and the British Prime Minister. As the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise is an American one, London counts as an exotic foreign location in a way in which it does not in the Bond series. In some respects ""Rogue Nation"" parallels recent developments in the Bond cycle. In early Bonds it was generally easy to tell who was on what side- Bond, his MI6 colleagues and the lovely Bond Girl were all on the side of right and justice whereas the villains (Dr No, Blofeld, Goldfinger, etc.) and their henchmen were first into bat for Satan's kingdom. Occasionally, as with Pussy Galore in ""Goldfinger"", the Bond Girl started off working for the baddies, but inevitably changed sides (aided by Bond's powers of seduction) when she realised just what a bastard her employer really was. In more recent episodes, however, Bond has had to cope with inter-service rivalry between MI5 and MI6, former British agents going over to the dark side and colleagues who prove untrustworthy. So it proves in ""Rogue Nation"". Hunt has to do battle not only against the Syndicate but also against the CIA, who want to shut down the IMF whose agents are regarded as unreliable. (In this context ""IMF"" stands not for ""International Monetary Fund"" but ""Impossible Mission Force""). The head of the Syndicate, Solomon Lane, turns out to be a rogue British agent (just like the characters played by Sean Bean in ""Goldeneye"" and Javier Bardem in ""Skyfall""). And Hunt never knows whom he can trust- not even the lovely Ilsa and his friend colleague Benji Dunn. (Ilsa, despite her German-sounding name, is also an MI6 agent). One difference between the ""Mission: Impossible"" series and the Bonds is that, although the series has been going for over twenty years, the main character has been played by the same actor throughout. Tom Cruise was 53 when ""Rogue Nation"" was made and I understand that he will return in a sixth instalment later this year, making him, at 56, older than either Sean Connery or Roger Moore when they made their final Bonds. In 2015, however, Cruise still looked youthful enough to be plausible as the hero of an action thriller, and I doubt if the intervening three years will have made much difference in this respect when ""Mission: Impossible"" emerges. Rebecca Ferguson makes a lovely heroine and there is a good cameo from Alec Baldwin as the CIA boss, although Sean Harris as Lane never seems very threatening, more like a provincial bank manager than a rogue spy or international terrorist.As a thriller, in fact, ""Rogue Nation"" is quite a decent one with some good special effects and well-handled action scenes. It does, however, have two problems, which it shares with a number of recent spy films involving betrayal or double-dealing. The first is that the plot at times becomes so complex it can be difficult to understand. The second is that plots of this nature are starting to become over-familiar; increasing complexity seems to increase, rather than decrease, the feeling of ""seen-it-all=before"". Perhaps it is time for a rethink of the modern spy genre. 6/10A goof. The Austrian Chancellor is referred to as a ""European head of state"". In fact, the Austrian Chancellor, like the British Prime Minister, is Head of Government but not Head of State. The Head of Sate of Austria is the President."
" An ActionFest Flick - Shame The Story Wasn't As Good As The Stunts...
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,8,"This is an all-out actionfest. Right from the opening you've got Cruise (Ethan Hunt) holding onto the side of an aeroplane as it takes off - Bloody Nutter! This in most films would be the top stunt; this, of course, is MI so it's just your opening salvo of insaneness.It's the story which kinda lets it down. These have now become secondary to the stunts, which I have to say are superb - and not too much CGI (except for the tech stuff, that is). Here you have a secret organisation called The Syndicate (nope they don't rig the lottery). But as ""syndicate"" describes a group working towards an aim, then the name is wrong as it turns out to be one man controlling his own mercenary army. I think there would have been great scope had it actually been a syndicate with many heads like the hydra.There are a couple of holes in the story though they are minor... except for the ending... just how did the bad guy NOT think the scenario would turn out this way. Bit of a let down as he'd been ahead of Hunt and his team all through the film. In fact, the way Lane (Sean Harris) manipulates people is pretty awesome and is a good plot builder and twist creator. It's this element that keeps the story interesting. But in the end, Hunt has to overcome... it's just a shame that the ending wasn't as twist orientated as the rest of the story.I cannot fault the direction or the pace of the film, as McQuarrie, gives the audience an atmospheric and excitement filled rollercoaster ride of a movie. He is great at filming the fight scenes and chases as well as the drama set-up acting scenes. For example the car and bike chase between Hunt and Ilsa Faust (Ferguson). When Hunt's car crashes he slows down the action to build tension... and then to build to a comical end to that scene, before revving up the torque to near maximum for the rest of the chase.In fact, it's Rebecca Ferguson (Faust) that adds Kudos to the cast. She gives a fantastic performance as a strong-minded and deadly woman who happens to be beautiful and sexy to boot. She even has an air of secrecy and mystery to her. You are never too sure about her or her motives. This in some way is told by the story but a lot of it comes from Ferguson's portrayal of Faust. This is one actress to watch. She and her character really made this film for me. It's nice to have a new strong character as we've gotten used to the others. And to be honest when I see Cruise, Penn, Rhames, Renner and Baldwin I actually see them and not their characters as throughout the years they've become partially stereotyped. Which is a shame as it's this that lets the film down slightly. At least in MI III, the writers tried to give Ethan Hunt a deeper character, one with issues and problems - shame they didn't progress down that line.I would happily recommend this to all lovers of Mission Impossible and action films alike. There's not much you have to do as a viewer except sit back and enjoy... hopefully you'll make it to the edge of your seat a couple of times."
" Ringing the same old mission bells...
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,6,"I don't watch the MI franchise anymore to make a connection with what was one of my favourite TV programmes growing up. I still like it though when a subtle or sometimes not so subtle reference comes into view but let's face it, I might as well be watching the latest Bourne or Bond for all the difference between these big spy-thriller franchises.Like Bond or Bourne, it will start with some jaw-droppingly stunning rescue or escape sequence to act as a prelude to the main film which then reveals itself as usually some fiendishly cunning plan by some mad scientist / megalomaniac which sees the team end up in interesting or exotic locations to resolve even if at times it seems impossible, before the big fake-out at the end puts the world back to normal.Things I liked about this entry; the fast-segment sequence over the still great theme music with scenes you never remember having seen when they eventually arrive in the actual film, the way the age-old ""Your mission, should you decide to accept it"" introduction sequence was turned on its head, the tried and tested use of masks for masquerade purposes plus some of the stunts were exciting, including the plane-hitching scene-setter, and Ethan's underwater raiding of a security vault. I also liked Jeremy Renner's character in the film and the neat trap sprung on Mr Big which saved the day.Things I liked less, Simon Pegg's Benjy is starting to grate on me, there was yet another high-speed car chase, this time pitting two wheels against four which had a seen-it-all-before air to it plus of course Tom Cruise as ever runs fit to burst his Fitbit.Don't get me wrong it was fine to disengage my brain for a couple of hours but I still think the great great TV show of my youth would have been better served by a cogent TV rather than cinematic reboot."
" Laughable and unapologetic
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"Was this film laughable? Oh, yes. But while every recent comic book and spy movie desperately wants to be dark/serious (Hi, DC comics!) or meta (Hello, Deadpool!), the MI movies are a rare franchise: they are unapologetic. They are silly and ridiculous and excessive. No apologies. While Bond gets gritty, MI gets - well - fun. And suddenly we all remember that predictably comic thrill rides are worth the price of admission. Eventually, the Tom Cruise run will become the Jeremy Renner run. But the franchise will live. It just needs to remember that masks and twists are not a bad formula."
" Great Fun
",2017-11-06 00:00:00,8,"Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation Plot In A Paragraph: Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team must track and bring down the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF.I really enjoyed this movie. Some great action set pieces with Cruise clearly doing his own stunts again. Although in great shape, his face is (finally) showing signs of ageing!! Once again Simon Pegg is a great and brings the laughs at just the right times. Jeremy Renner is solid as always, Ving Rhames pops up in a small supporting role and Alex Baldwin looks like being a permanent part of the franchise (well until his recent twitter rants) Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation grossed $195 million at the domestic Box Office to end 2015 the 11th highest grossing movie of the year. It's worth noting that it becoming the second highest-grossing film in the series (Behind Ghost Protocol) as well as the 8th highest grossing movie of the year worldwide."
" Great action scenes
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,9,"I would say this movie probably has the best action scenes in the series. The action is all well done and none of it feels so over the top that you can't be able to comprehend the fact that it is happening. It is a nice combination of fun and silly. The story line has a few good twists here and there and the character of Baldwin was a nice twist and I wonder how he will be in future installments. I also like the fact that the cast from the last movie, aside from the girl, were all in this movie. Which was a nice change instead of a cast that all dies off by the end of the movie or just leaves. And to cap it all off, Luthor continues his streak of being in every movie even if it is just for a quick ten second cameo"
" Cruise cheats death and defies age yet again
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)This is your high end, glossy, mega summer action flic. The plot is the bland baked potato to add on the glitzly thrills and action scenes. Thus as the plot fades from memory, when I saw it a couple weeks ago, what remains is that government is trying to close down Ethan and his team as they are too high risk. Of course they prove their worth through many wiz-bang scenes, special effects and some really good chase scenes. Of course Cruise finds his way, once again, onto a crotch rocket. A very fun and thrilling popcorn movie that will help Cruise shovel cash into his bank account."
" Fifth and continues to be interesting...
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,7,"""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is the fifth movie of the Mission Impossible franchise and it continues getting better. The movie starts where the fourth movie finished following the hints about Syndicate and how Ethan could reveal it.I liked the movie and I enjoyed it more than I expected. The fourth movie of this franchise was equally good with this and I believe that they both followed the same pattern. Once more the interpretation of Tom Cruise was very good, another good interpretation in my opinion was Rebecca's Ferguson and Jeremy's Renner.To sum up I would like to say that ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" is really a worth watching movie and I recommended to everyone. This movie kept me in tense and it was very interesting. In addition to this it has to be considered as a successful blockbuster movie."
" The best action movie ever made
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,10,"""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" is the best action movie I have ever seen! From the truly spectacular Airbus opening, through penetrating SKIFF facility in Casablanca and beautiful chase sequences, to the gripping end where Benji is sitting in a bomb vest, the movie offers really thrilling ride. Christopher McQuarrie, his team and all the actors did an amazing job! If there is some movie that deserves 10/10, this is it!"
" Good film
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,6,"There are big action sequences here, each lasting around ten minutes more or less, and they are all high-octane thrill-rides that never let up and make this such an entertaining film.Tom Cruise proves once again that he's a blockbuster star like no other, giving his all in the action here, whether it's attaching himself to a plane, jumping in a chasm of water or riding a superbike through the desert (in what was, in my opinion, the greatest, most exhilarating car chase ever).On that note, actually, the incredible bike chase is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the great action, but credit has to go to director Christopher McQuarrie for excellently turning this into a good-looking and intense action thriller, using great camera work (avoiding shaky cam) to make it so brilliantly entertaining.Away from the stunts, this film has still got a very good plot to it. There are few blockbusters that couple great action and intelligent storytelling nowadays, but this really bucks that trend, because it's absolutely enthralling to follow from start to finish.There are betrayals and deceptions galore in this spy thriller, as well as a genuinely exciting climax, which is so unpredictable that it makes you forget about the generic plots of the less successful films and be properly engrossed in the current story.Finally, this is also a very nice film to look at, thanks both to McQuarrie's direction, as well as the beautiful sets and landscapes that this is set in all over the world. From the mesmerising desert of Morocco to the foggy alleys of London, this is a global journey that goes even further than the previous films, and comes out with a stunning result, the best of the series in my opinion!"
" Mission: Impossible Rouge Nation Review
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,7,"2015 was a prolific year for spy films, we had The Man From Uncle, Spy, Spectre, and of course Mission: Impossible - Rouge Nation which is the best of the bunch. Rouge Nation is Tom Cruise's fifth outing as IMF super spy Ethan Hunt. Mission: Impossible is a franchise that has constantly changed and evolved with every incarnation. This is mostly down to the franchise having different directors that have their own take on the story.I watched this film upon its initial release in the cinema, and whilst I liked the film then, I didn't think it was particularly memorable. Whilst I still find that true to some degree, upon my re-watch it's definitely a whole lot more fun and engaging then I initially gave it credit for.The opening scene is the obvious go to argument for the best set piece of the film. It's a fantastic sequence, which is perpetuated by the fact that Tom Cruise is literally hanging off the side of a plane as it's taking off. It's a piece of film-making that solidifies Tom Cruise's position as one of the most dedicated actors of his generation. The film is worth watching just for the opening five minutes. Thankfully though the film doesn't rest on its laurels as it could quite easily of done.The best sequence of the film, in this humble reviewers opinion is the Opera scene. As Ethan Hunt and partner Benji(played with fantastic comedic enthusiasm by Simon Pegg.) race against time as they try to prevent the assassination of the Austrian chancellor, by a shadowy criminal organisation only known as the Syndicate. The Syndicate is lead by an ex British secret agent called Solomon Lane. Sean Harris tries his best to be a menacing figure as Lane, but fails to convince as a legitimate omnipresent villain in the film. His character is poorly thought out and given very little depth. He becomes yet another throwaway villain in the Mission: Impossible canon.Whilst on the other hand newcomer to the series, and the female lead of the film Rebecca Ferguson feels like a breath of fresh air for the franchise. She plays a British double agent Ilsa Faust. She does a fantastic job of portraying a complete bad-ass that can beat up anyone in her way, or through her alluring sensuality. She's given the most depth and made the most sympathetic character as a turncoat agent whose loyalties are never trusted, at-least until she no longer requires certain characters expertise.Christopher McQuarie does a terrific job directing the film. The editing, and action scenes are top notch. They are well put together and the action flows seamlessly, they are coherent unlike a-lot of big budget action films. The film does have issues in the script department, especially with the main villain. It's also fairly predictable in some areas. Whilst this does slightly detract from the film, it's made up for by a fantastic female lead, and a great supporting cast. Overall Rouge Nation is a lot of fun, and one of the better action films from 2015."
" I loved it.
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,9,"Cruise was great as well as the entire cast, except for Alec Baldwin who is a bore and totally unconvincing as a serious actor. He belongs on sketch TV where potheads think he funny. Simon Pegg is funny and does his part with perfection. Rebecca Ferguson is suited well as an intriguing sexy spy, and the stunts are fabulous. As much as I have enjoyed Ving Rhames in past roles, he did not shine this time around. The entire movie was done extraordinarily well, and is Oscar worthy to me."
" One must see mission
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,9,"Found the first three films ones that had a lot to like (namely the action, the visuals, good casting on the whole and Philip Seymour Hoffmann's superb villain in the third) but also their faults (plot convolution in the first and third and the characters could have been written better in the second and third).'Ghost Protocool' to me was a great film and the best of the series since the original, and actually better than it, mainly because the story even though somewhat familiar seemed more focused and far less convoluted. The latest instalment 'Rogue Nation' is on 'Ghost Protocool's' very high level. Sure, there is a little bit of familiarity and the basic structure is somewhat formulaic, but 'Rogue Nation' has enough freshness and so much fast and furious excitement and thrills it doesn't feel like an issue.Visually, 'Rogue Nation' is even slicker and even more stylish than 'Ghost Protocool', perhaps the most audacious of all five films put together. The locations, from sinister drabness to stunningly colourful, are a feast for the eye and the effect dazzle. The music doesn't overbear the action and such at all while making a pulsating impact thanks to the thrillingly authentic sound.With the exception of a few choppy combat scenes, big emphasis on the few, the action is bigger, bolder and more dynamic than any other action scenes seen before in the previous four instalments. Many are breath-taking in their excitement and also nuances. Christopher McQuarrie's directing is some of the best he's ever done, with a great sense of visual style and a real grasp of the storytelling.'Rogue Nation's' script is sharp, knowingly sophisticated with the humour (not cheesy or out of place) and intrigue superbly balanced. The story is told at a breakneck pace without being rushed and grips one right in and never lets go. There is an appealing light-heartedness, tongue-in-cheek and suspense of superior tension and elegance (as far as the 'Mission Impossible' films go) worthy of Alfred Hitchcock, a big claim and to some hyperbolic but it felt that way to me and it is grand praise indeed.Tom Cruise is very impressive, handling the stunts with effortless and enviable ease and acting with steely charisma. Rebecca Ferguson shows a knack for scene-stealing, with her in ersatz breath-of-fresh-air form. Sean Harris is an intimidatingly menacing villain, one of the best written villains of the series, while Simon Pegg's comic relief in no way jars and is actually very funny and Jeremy Renner's presence is more than welcome. It is a shame however that Ving Rhames, though charismatic, is underused.Overall, a sheer delight and one mission that is a must see. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
" An impressive addition to the franchise
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,8,"This, the fifth instalment in the Mission Impossible franchise, sees Ethan Hunt and the IMF working to bring down an organisation known as 'The Syndicate' and its leader Solomon Lane. This is apparently made up of agents from a variety of countries who have either been disavowed or believed dead it is also so shadowy that many people believe it is a figment of the IMF's imagination. The director of the CIA is one such doubter and he has successfully called to IMF to be shut down leaving Hunt officially unsupported. A lead takes him to Vienna where, with the help of Benji, he attempts to prevent the assassination of the Austrian Chancellor. Here he bumps into Ilsa Faust, a woman who previously helped him escape from The Syndicate. Later he will have to work with her but it isn't obvious whether she is also working to bring down The Syndicate or whether she is working for them to get Hunt to help them with a particular problem.This is a fine addition to the Mission Impossible films. It gets off to an impressive start with an opening that sees Hunt clinging to the outside of a plane as it takes off that contains stolen nerve gas. Once the main story gets underway it is quickly explained what the latest mission is and that IMF have been officially shut down. The story is relatively simple but there is plenty of tension as we don't know where the loyalties of some key characters really are. Inevitable there lots of exciting moments, as well as the opening we get several impressive chases, a raid on a computer facility that requires Hunt to stay under water without breathing apparatus for a dangerously long time and a fight high above the stage of an opera house while a performance is underway. The pace of action means the viewer doesn't have time to think about how far-fetched it all is if it wasn't far-fetched it wouldn't be Mission Impossible! The cast does an impressive job, Tom Cruise continues to do a great job as Ethan Hunt as he makes the most unlikely things seem believable. He is ably supported by Simon Pegg, who brings some light relief as Benji; Rebecca Ferguson, as the ambiguous Isla and Sean Harris who is suitably menacing as the villainous Lane. The rest of the cast are pretty solid too. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the franchise; it provides two hours of solid action that isn't too violent for younger viewers to watch."
" The best one out of the Mission Impossible series.
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,7,"The first movie is okay, the second, third and fourth are boring, Rogue Nation is better than all of them combined, Rogue Nation has more action, more thrills and is altogether more lively.The film score is catchy, although it does sound like it could also fit in with a comedy movie.Great acting, great directing, and well-written.A decent action flick."
" Ethan Hunt keeps plugging away
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,7,"Though not as visually dazzling as Ghost Patrol, Mission Impossible 5 still passes with flying colours. It does exactly what you expect it to do, which makes it as good to watch as it is forgettable after ward.There are some sexy action pieces in this entry, complemented by Robert Elswit's crisp photography. A long sequence involves Ethan Hunt and his team have to crack a digitally advanced security system, with lots of digital projection. The cyber-tech in the movie is a little too extraordinary because it leans too close to science fiction. In terms of the cast, the highlight is Simon Pegg. He bring a good dose of intelligent whimsy to a picture that is a little hard to take seriously. Tom Cruise does what he does best, although probably not doing as many of his own stunts as he used to. The baddies are all one- dimensional, but that isn't unusual in this franchise. Mission Impossible may be coming of age but it's not a dead franchise yet."
" A good addition to the series
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,8,"Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and team take on another seemingly impossible mission, tracking down the Syndicate - a highly skilled international rogue organisation, committed to destroying the IMF. This is the fifth entry in a franchise that began almost twenty years ago and all the MI films have offered memorable action and 'Rogue Nation' doesn't disappoint, from its opening plane stunt, a fight scene played out in the Vienna Opera House, a frantic car/bike chase within the narrow streets of Morocco (which are all brilliantly tense and exciting), however the one scene that failed to impress as much was the underwater vault scene. But it feels like we've been here before.... face masks, double agents, a weak villain and the 'disavowed' team proving their worth. I seriously thought this film was going to beat Ghost Protocol, judging by all the reviews, but it didn't. Ghost Protocol still remains as the best Mission Impossible film in the series in my opinion. The Bottom Line..action-packed, adventurous and entertaining, if slightly longer than it needed to be. 'Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation' is a good addition to the series."
" Which number is this in the franchise?
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,7,"I've just watched 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.' I notice that for a film in an ongoing franchise, it doesn't actually have a number attached to the title. I'm guessing this is generally because it doesn't matter which one it is. If you've seen any of the previous instalments (excluding the original which requires some sort of post doctorate in nuclear physics to understand the numerous double-crossing plot threads) then you'll know what you're getting. The 'MI' franchise has certainly settled into a formula and, try as I might to hate it for basically doing the same thing over and over again, I have to confess that I thoroughly enjoyed it (after all, if Marvel can do it, why can't Tom?!).Tom Cruise plays oh, does it matter? He basically plays Tom Cruise playing a sort of James Bond role where his team of secret agents has to stop (yet another) super villainous organisation from overthrowing Britain. As a Brit, I could probably take offense at us needing saving, but my fellow countryman Simon 'Shaun of the Dead' Pegg is helping him out, so I guess I'll let that one slide. He accomplishes this through numerous high-octane car chases, gun fights and stunts – none of which leaving so much as a scratch on our hero.Oh, dear – three paragraphs in and I'm already running out of things to say about 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.' I'm guessing that's because there's not much that can be said about it that you haven't already seen written about the others. In all the film franchises of recent times (including the reliably similar Marvel movies) this is just about as identical in structure as those that have come before it. In a nutshell: if you like Tom Cruise then you'll probably like this. If you've liked any of the previous instalments (2-4) then you'll also like this. Of course if you haven't seen any of them and you're just a fan of action movies with a pinch of spy/doublecross involved, again you'll get something out of it. You don't really need to know what's come before. You can join the franchise here or at any point after the first film. Just put your brain in 'neutral' and enjoy the nicely-choreographed action scenes and Tom Cruise fighting wave after wave of useless henchmen. Sheer popcorn fun.Oh, and I've just checked online. It appears that yet another 'Mission Impossible' film is pencilled in for 2018. Gee, I wonder what that one will be like?! It's fair to say that I'll be watching it either way. The only downside will be that when I come to review it I'll probably have even less original observations to make about it than I did here!"
" Clichéd, by the book, lazy - you get the message
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,2,"A quid in a charity shop - having enjoyed most of the others, and with this one being the most recent, I couldn't believe my luck! But now I know why someone donated it, and I feel short changed...The Tom Cruise action series rumbles on and does so in a text book tick- the-box fashion - car chases (tick), chases on foot with gun and fights and stuff (tick), chases in the dark (tick), world wide locations (tick), Cruise being the only one with the 'vision' (tick), Cruise going on the run (tick), subterfuge and deception as standard (tick), the authorities not appreciating Cruise and his IMF chums (tick), Cruise having to do something death defying (tick) several times (tick), Cruise on a motorbike (tick), Cruise going against the advice of his IMF colleagues (tick), guns, lots of guns and gadgets and technology (tick), Cruise saving the girl (tick), the day (tick), the world (tick), etc (tick). The writers appear to have either fallen asleep or just grown lazy when coming up with this one: the CIA (boo, hiss) want to close down Cruise (hurrah!) and his playmates for not being reliable with saving the world, citing the plots of previous films (breaking into CIA headquarters, destruction of the Kremlin, the missile that didn't wipe out Seattle, etc) to which Jeremy Renner (as Brandt) has to appear before a board of bigwigs and the CIA boss (Alec Baldwin) to argue his case for them not to be closed down (wasn't Renner a field agent in the previous movies? Where was their boss anyway?), which the CIA want, purely so that they can control an out of control Ethan Hawk (Cruise). But when the IMF (Cruise's boys) subsequently gets closed down, and absorbed into the CIA, Cruise goes underground to carry on his investigation into a group that everyone except Cruise (obviously!) believes does not exist. Baldwin decides that Cruise has gone renegade and pursues him like there isn't a bigger problem in the world to occupy his time (incidentally, it is unfortunate that the world moves on and Baldwin now plays the orange US president on SNL, because that was all I could think of in every one of his scenes), even to the point of making it a shoot to kill mission, seemingly because Cruise made a fool of him. There was a beautiful British enemy agent (actually working for the British secret service - or was she?) in a bikini, there was an unemotionally evil criminal boss with a weird voice, there was an evil British government minister with ugly glasses and a dull voice, there were a few evil henchmen who looked as though central casting had been asked to just send some mean-looking east European-looking hombres (own hair not important) along, there was blundering Benji and dependable Luther to do the technical stuff, warn Cruise not to give the secret 'gadget thing' to the opposition and look scared, confused and knowing as required. Like I said earlier, straight out of a text book; sometimes the end result of a scenario was practically telegraphed, it was so predictable. The mystery came from trying to figure out whether the girl would die before the end of the film, and how the baddie would die (spoiler - he doesn't).On the DVD there was an additional special feature, a short called Cruise Control, about (surprise surprise) Tom Cruise, a little propaganda piece in favour of Cruise, with his colleagues (from both in front of and behind the camera) telling us that he was a dream to work with, that he was on the side of the movie goer, that he was dedicated to bringing the best film possible to the viewer, etc. My eyes glazed over and as a result I missed the end, but it is safe to assume that Cruise overcame the baddies, got the girl, and saved the world as usual. I have been of the opinion that M:I2 was the worst of the bunch; it might still be if I can't convince myself that lazy and predictable equals bad."
" It's wonderful movie full of impossible Things !! Wooow
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,10,"Ethan Hunt, it is really Tom Cruise who makes his entrance clambering over a hill and exhorting his lovable tech guy Benji (Simon Pegg) to use his hacking skill to open the door of a cargo transport plane that's about to take off with a belly full of nukes stolen by Chechen separatists or something, I don't know who they are, it doesn't matter, Tom Cruise is running, arms and legs pumping, hair flying, and holy mother he's climbing onto the top of the plane and hanging to its underbelly as it takes off, with his bare hands!"
" Exciting to watch, from start until the end.
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie should not be compared with both its' predecessors. MI:5 Rogue Nation is something else. Thrills and excites you from start to the end. The scenario is solid and leaving no loose ends. I can watch this movie again and again.It contains everything you love about the movies. Suspense, mystery, drama, intelligent action & plot."
" Has Now Surpassed Bond In Terms Of Rollicking Action Fun
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"I'm not usually the type that gets all too excited about action/adventure romp, but for the past, oh, 20 years of my life I've always been excited for the next James Bond movie to come out. My one indulgence in the genre. In recent years, however, that franchise has gone a bit stale, allowing the Mission Impossible franchise, including this ""Rogue Nation"" installment, to take the crown of best action movie.For a basic plot summary, ""Rogue Nation"" sees the IMF being shut down by the CIA Director (Alec Baldwin) right as they are on the verge of taking down the shadowy Syndicate, a network of crime baddies run by the mysterious Lane (Sean Harris). Now more off the books than ever before, the IMF team of Hunt (Tom Cruise), Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Luther (Ving Rhames) must track down Lane before they are out of time and resources. Lending a helping hand (or is it?) is British double-agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who seems to be playing all sides at once.Obviously, any ""Mission Impossible"" movie (especially those still under the helm of JJ Abrams' Bad Robot productions) is going to be judged on how riveting and pulse-pounding the action scenes are. ""Rogue Nation"" doesn't fail in that category one bit! From the opening scene of the film, which sees Tom Cruise perform one of the craziest stunts I've ever seen in a movie, the action scenes will blow you to the back of your chair. They are slick, have a great backing soundtrack, but also don't go on forever and ever. It never feels like the film is just a few extended action scenes cobbled together. Each action montage has a purpose.Along those lines, ""Rogue Nation"" manages to good from ""okay action romp"" to ""really entertaining flick"" due to the fact that it's able to weave an actual story into the proceedings. Not only that, but it's a story that will legitimately have you intrigued and guessing as to how everything will turn out. This is where the franchise really separates itself from the recent Bond efforts. Those films haven't had a great story since ""Casino Royale"", and before that it was ""Goldeneye"". That's two in about 20 years. Every since Bad Robot took the helm of the MI series, the three films have gotten progressively better.One final quick note about the MI/Bond comparison: These movies are far better at using female protagonists as well. Whereas the concept of ""Bond Girls"" is now at odds with the culture at large (unlike the franchise's heyday in the 60s and 70s), the MI films are able to utilize a sexy female lead who, at the same time, isn't just eye candy waiting to be bedded by the hero.So, despite the fact that Bond movies might still have more name recognition and gravitas behind them, the MI flicks have slowly crept up and taken their place as kind of the action/adventure romp. ""Rogue Nation"" is slick, smart, funny, a spectacle to watch, and even has a story that will keep you engaged. Hey, isn't that what the Bond franchise used to be able to do?"
" An Excellent Addition To The Mission: Impossible franchise
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Tom Cruise returns to the role of IMF agent Ethan Hunt in this exciting, wonderful new installment. There are plenty of intense set pieces, including the opening plane scene and the wonderfully choreographed opera scene. The characters in this movie are okay, and Rebecca Ferguson delivers plenty of excitement and anticipation as Ilsa Faust, the mysterious new femme fatale whose motivations are never clear to the audience. The movie's main antagonist, however, is horrible and underdeveloped, and his motivations are never exactly clear. Why does he want to destroy the IMF? Is it because of the money? However, don't let this bloke spoil your enjoyment of the movie. My personal favourite set piece is the opera scene, which is ruined considerably by a twist at the end of the same scene. Nevertheless, this film is a wonderful addition to an already wonderful franchise."
" The Exact Amount of Action, Suspense and Intrigue Necessary for a Movie of this Type
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"Without a secretary for the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) the Operations Director named ""William Brandt"" (Jeremy Renner) is unable to defend its continued existence by a Senate committee in the face of accusations by the Director of the C.I.A. ""Alan Hunley"" (Alec Baldwin). As a result, ""Agent Ethan Hunt"" (Tom Cruise) is declared a rogue operative and is forced to continue his investigation against a criminal organization known as the Syndicate all by himself. Unfortunately, when his investigation leads him to the exact location where the Chancellor of Austria is assassinated the orders from the C.I.A. now become focused on eliminating him--permanently. If that wasn't bad enough, his only lead is a former agent for MI6 named ""Ilsa Faust"" (Rebecca Ferguson) whose allegiance is questionable at best and for the moment happens to be the only person he can trust. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought this was an excellent spy film which contained the exact amount of action, suspense and intrigue necessary for a movie of this type. Likewise, I also enjoyed the performances of both Tom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson who seemed to work real well together. Again, I thought that this was an excellent movie and I have rated it accordingly."
" Must watch
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"OK, guys, something's wrong with me. I am amazed by the MI movie. Me, who hates action movies and Tom Cruise... I could watch it again straight away. Cruise is a bit older and much less irritating than usual, the rest of the crew is awesome, action scenes are adrenaline feast but the movie itself is not an action movie anymore. It's more of a spy thriller, and a good one too. The movie starts fast and rushes faster and faster until the perfect ending. I could not find any weak spots in this sequel and it definitely is the best one so far. I gave it 9/10 only because 10/10 is reserved for the best movies of all times, classics of cinematography that will never grow old, and I could not go that far to put MI in the same box with them. Although, if they continue to make every new MI better than previous I am afraid it might reach perfect 10 soon enough.9/10"
" Can Only Go Up From Here
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,4,"Not all Mission Impossibles are created equal and this one is definitely at or towards the bottom. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is in a desperate pursuit of a super villain and his goons known as The Syndicate (I know, how clever). He is aided (for reasons unknown initially) by a woman named Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) in his attempts to bring down The Syndicate.Allow me to digress for a minute. When did it become the preferred fighting style and the go to move for women to elaborately, acrobatically and lithely jump while simultaneously wrapping their legs around an assailants arm, or preferably neck, in order to then either A.) break his neck, B.) strike him in a vulnerable area or C.) use a sharp object to kill him? I've seen plenty of MMA and if this was a viable and effective move as the movies would have me believe then surely ONE of the many mixed martial artists would have employed this coda. I've never seen Rhonda Rousey use the jump- scissor-kick submission move once. Aaah, but with the aid of film editing and jump cuts we see countless men helpless to defend themselves against this awesome finishing move. It is the great equalizer for the 120 pound female and Ms. Faust had three opportunities to use it.OK, back to my review. Where was I? Oh, yes... Ethan does all this badass stuff, gets help from a superbad chick and you know the rest. The story was simply stale and after a while you get a little bored with the one-up death defying stunt. Just to show how lame this episode was the CIA director, played by Alec Baldwin, said that he would have to activate the Special Activities Division. As I do with all government organizations I quickly reduced it to its acronym and had to laugh. I think that summed up this entire movie: SAD."
" Twists & turns galore
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,9,"The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is that the overall emotional concept is a bit scattered. It's such a big team that the central character's personal stakes are not all that riveting. It's sort of a romantic tease for things to possibly come for Ethan though, so the fun factor overrides any lack of emotional angst.The theme is very interesting & very clear, though words are seldom used to convey it: loyalty can be fickle.Such a theme lends to great twists & turns. EVERY single character (except one minor bad guy) flipflops at least once in their loyalties (or seems to). It's a very complex roller-coaster that provides a really fun, knucklebiting ride as betrayals are followed by victories which are then undone by more betrayals, etc. After several viewing it never gets boring.This is how an action film should be. Well done. Definitely my favorite in an ever improving series, which is rare. The biggest dud in the series is the first film, which in its time was a wonderful breakthrough & still very watchable despite a very slower pacing.The trademark alternative realities given in flashforwards & flashbacks continue to stand out as a fun element that keeps the mind engaged.Not sure how they'll top this one without getting formulaic."
" Its about time actions went back to being action films
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,9,"I could write a ten page report on this movie so keeping under a 1,000 words is super difficult for me. Thank you for getting back to what action movies are suppose to be. Car chase, fine women, violence, guns, and moves that make you go ""wow that was original"". This film set its own expectations for fight scenes. And it took Tom Cruise to do it. This man has been acting for well over 30 years. And still brings it in films.As I've said in other movie reviews I updated my blu ray collection and picked the 5 set of movies in a box set. I had to watch this one first. I've seen all the other ones except mission impossible one. And I was a huge fan of mission impossible two. I know some people might view this never have seen any mission impossibles wondering if this good. Don't ask your friends, just watch the movie. You also have to like action movies. If you like what everybody else likes and non original ideas based around comics you already have heard about or simply cartoons that you knew were coming out, this movie is not for you.If you are thinking you are going to see top gun or risky business (which by the way are my favorite, i own both on blu ray as well) then this isn't for you. Tom Cruise is a great actor and his sarcasm is easily a throw back to the james bond days. All characters in this movie were great actors.What more can I say about alec bladwin. Hes authority character he has done is so underrated in the filming industry its really sad. He played an authority character in The Departed and that was a 5 star movie. He just has a knack for drama and acting. Which he was the only person who added drama to this movie. And it was needed for making the plot come together. You can't really teach that. That was all alec baldwin. As original as some things were, they were not original on the idea. Seriously this is your typical spy movie, james bond and jason bourne have made a killing on that. Have a target you are looking for, bring back all the people who help the spy out as the same characters you know and love, throw in a woman you can't tell at first if she is working with the enemy but turns out to double cross the bad guy. And yes I have seen the whole working for the other good guys think plenty of times too. Its nothing new.The car scenes as well were nothing new. You can tell BMW was part of this film, every car made you wish you had it. And yes some of the engine sounds were made up by a voice over of some kind. But if you have the 5.1 surround that comes with the disc you wont complain. And unlike those first bond movies, I can hear bullets whizzing by at 5.1 surround sound. I'm not expert of bullets whizzing around so Ill just except that as a good quality sound.And unlike other action movies. They lose you in the movie. Right to where you get to climax you just fall off. Like a date that just isn't going well anymore. You just want to get dropped off and go home or drop the person off and go home. To many of these female characters don't play the part. I don't know if its the director telling them stick to their script or what. But they sound so stiff and simply predictable. This woman did not. She sounds sexy, gorgeous and she knows how to handle herself. Exactly how I expect a female agent to act. I think katie holmes was in the 3rd one. I almost passed out from boredom of her character. I was going to list everything I liked about this movie in this review cause their were a lot but one of my favorite things was that it was set in a foreign place. Not sure how a lot of movies got away from that. It just has a certain feel to it. I enjoy the spy's who have a damn visa or create themselves one even if they are rogue. How the heck are you going to convince me you are trained killer or simply a covert specialist when you can't even get across your own border?And the end of the day this was a great movie. There was some things to take away from the movie. The bad guy didn't bring the film down. But I could have put john travolta in their and got much better results with a lot better lines. The girl was was definitely great. The part where she is in her bikini bottom was wonderful. Reminded you of the old bond movies where you were waiting for that character to show up like that. Its a must watch movie and honestly probably the best action movie I've seen in a while."
