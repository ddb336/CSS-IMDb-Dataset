" It's art.
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,"Horror worked. Nice thriller movie. Acting, storyline is üëåüëåüèª"
" Glaring shortcomings, but Kudos to the one man effort.
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,6,"Saw this movie after hunting for ages the combo of Original language and subtitles. Had to refuse the Sunnxt version as it was a truncated version. Found a proper one with some effort. Now for the review.
The movie has been drafted nicely, but the execution shows the immaturity and shortcomings. Lack of character development, immaturely inserted sound bits, unnecessary humour, and the lack in creating the stage that was required for marquee scenes. Unnatural human reactions are scattered throughout, making the scenes cringe-worthy. There is predictability in there as well as the villain was apparent quite early into the film.The project could have been better, but the slack in the making made the movie dip in quality. But, as I read about the trivia and other details, it was understandable that this was an out and out Mr Bhandari's project and I think he will only get better with time. From what is mentioned about his contributions, for a single person to chip in with this much the chances of quality taking a hit increases. I wish him all the best and will be keeping an eye out for his future projects. He has shown a penchant to be taking the onus and that must be lauded. This is no mean feat for a single person."
" O V E R R A T E D
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,6,"I would say nothing more than it deserves a maximum of 6 stars as an average-rated movie. Being on the top list, having more than 6 ratings does not go with this movie. The performance was a very bad, cheap and unnecessary comedy. Nonsense scenes. Which are the elements of a commercial cum bad movie. Watch it with low expectations can save you time."
" Simply overrated. Forced Hype!
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,3,Oddly boring movie. Nothing special here. Acting is also average. The scenes which are supposed to be scary are not scary at all. Law budget overrated flick. Too Many plot holes throughout the movie.
" Worst movie I have ever seen
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,1,This movie has nothing good it's simply a waste of time. I was very excited to watch this movie because this movie ratings were very good. My review is actually a warning for you so please do not waste your precious time and go for other choices.
" Over dose of suspence thriller. Mind blowing
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,10,The movie is fantabulous and made of with briliant concept . This made me confused till the end
" Just wow...
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,Just watch it... superb kannada movie..... great story.....
" Slight dissapointment
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,4,"The starting part of the movie is good where it is successful to keep the audience hooked. As the movie progresses, it becomes obvious that the Director or Story-writer became confused or atleast failed to potray the idea on the screen. I won't go into the details as it may reveal suspense but in the later part, most of the facts seems out of place and are simply put to fill the gaps. There was lack of common sense and logic. The actors were horrible except the main antagonist. The good part is nice location, special audio-visual effects."
" Unnecessary complications!!
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,5,"Unnecessary complications!! It seemed as though the plots of a simple straightforward story were jumbled up to give the movie an intelligent look, but unfortunately it failed miserably."
" Most overrated film
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,1,I watched this film due to its high rating but was highly disappointed after finishing.Its like an immature have made this film.It seems scary but at the same time its funny.i will never approve watching it to non kannada audience.
" Short and quick
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,8,Point to point direction and easy to understand....good work RangiTaranga team
" After such an entrhralling first half, the second half was a real let down
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,7,"RangiTaranga is a suspence thriller, but has elements of Psychological thriller, horror and inverstigation thriller as well. And that exactly is the problem I have with the film. The narrative is not consistent. The haunting feels at the start were totally unnecessary . After having a few moments, it was never a proper horror film.The male lead was not any good. He did not display any shades of character during throughout the film. And the girl who played Sandhya was not any good as well. The policeman was the wierdest character among all. This attitude, behaviour was so pathetic, seriously what kind of character they have written for him. Principal and Kalinga(played by Sai kumar) were the only characters that were played well, rest all actors were novice.Coming to the ending, it was good but left some questions unanswered. All the supernatural things that were happening in the start, what was the reason behind?The storyline was good enough to make it a masterpiece. It would have been a lot better with proper handling and better actors."
" Average !
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,6,"First portion of this movie was fine. But after a sudden of time Hero felt in some problems. He lost his wife. Everything was just like a thrilling point or ghost created. But to continue this movie it changed the fact , it was totally foggy ! Story line up mixed just like hotchpotch ! And end of the portion we can see , who was the gentleman of this movie a postmaster was a serial killer .Its the main fact. Not exceptional."
" Brilliancy on the peak
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,10,"I was the one who used to criticize Sandalwood movies, but this movie actually changed my perception on that. And i am so glad it did!"
" An excellent story ruined by mediocre set pieces and poor editing and direction
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,6,"Rangitaranga was a lukewarm experience. The movie's script soo strong you can't get away without watching the whole but The editing and Direction soo weak that you can't stop yourself from rolling your eyes of. I understand the budget constraints of the regional cinema but we've seen so much well made films which are technically and materialistically brilliant on low budgets but this one simply can't be one of them. There were moments it frightened me and there were moments I was intrigued but the screenplay made it a bit predictable or rather the choppiness of the film did that. I wasn't sure what was the factor. The underline of this review is that , it's a one time watch but don't keep any high expectations"
" Disastrous movie !!
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,1,"I don't understand why is this movie so hyped.1. Lame story
2. Very bad ending
3. Very poor acting"
" Not at all great
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,2,"Hyped as one of the best thrillers in sandalwood, I saw rangitharanga. Plus points are it's first half which showed some promise and saikumar who is the only actor in this film giving a matured performance. But all problems start in second half where director messed up everything with unnecessary subplots and unconvincing twists. Director tried to make a supernatural, psychological and investigation thriller in one film but fails. But the worse thing of the film is the lead actor who does not show any expressions on his face especially when his character gets to know many shocking things. The wife character gives a very immature performance. Journalist character was better. And the police character acts like 70s villains with those laughs. On the whole rangi tharanga is just a run off the mill thriller. Kannada audience found it great because they are inferior towards thriller films."
" Good screenplay with some logic holes
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,7,Entire movie is good and thriller upto last scene u cant find the suspense but same time lot of logic holes in that.some of scenes not explained properly and pscyco thriller movie lot of horrific happens without logic
" Awesome movie
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,9,"Must watch, because it doesn't over do the horror genre and keeps it simple"
" One of the best movies I ever seen
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,10,I don't find words to explain the movie because it's such amazing movie ..i haven't expected such kind of good movies in Kannada industry but Rangitaranga rocks!!
" Thriller
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,10,"The movie has a good plot for different characters, all events are linked to each other. A must watch for some brain work."
" Must Watch Film
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely fantastic movie. I have never watched a movie 5 times in my 28 years.
Non stop entertainment. Everytime you see it, you will notice new things to be solved in the movie. 
Like it or not. This is one of the best Kannada and Indian film ever made"
" A Mysterious Ride!!!
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,7,"Journalist Sandhya is on a mission to find out an anonymous novelist named Anashku. Meanwhile, Gautam who writes under the name Anashku takes his wife Indu to visit Kamarottu. The journey gets complicated when they start to experience some unnatural occurrences. Anup's storytelling style was really impressive and he has brought back some art forms like Bhootaradhane and Yakshagana into play which was kind of haunting too. The story is enough to keep you occupied throughout the movie and the background score, cinematography also plays vital roles in the movie. Overall, It's an engaging, mysterious thriller movie and a must watch."
