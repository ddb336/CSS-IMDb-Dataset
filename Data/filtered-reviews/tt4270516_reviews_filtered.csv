" Hills Like White Elephants
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,10,"Great Feminist Movie! Surprised it was done by a man. Reminded me of Hemingway's 'Hills Like White Elephants'. I especially loved Tomlin's line about a decision that she may think about everyday for the rest of her life.
You can get the details from one of the other reviews. I just loved this movie."
" Just horrible
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,1,"Basic premise: shaking down other people for abortion money. Fun, right?"
" One for the ladies
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,3,"Short, quirky film from the indie mould. Strong performances, nicely shot, good pace... terrible script. The base storyline isn't bad but has one tired clique after another tied to it - strong women, weak men etc. This is a 'progressive' film women made for women. If you like that sort of thing you'll love this - hence the high score."
" It was painful
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,1,"I expected humor. Instead, it was just Grandma throwing one tantrum after another throughout the film. Not good."
" NOT really funny, NOT really dramatic either. What's left? Mediocre acting without chemistry between the actors.
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,5,"A miss. Good actors for sure, but there is no chemistry between them. The dialogues feel strained and unnatural. And the story is nothing out of the ordinary.The bad: it's lacking chemistry. From the get go, the first scenes, things dont gel well between the actors. Dialogues are strained and dont sound natural.Any good? Perhaps suited for those who are interested in the simple story of a grandchild temporarily being raised by a grandmother. It's not a bad movie, simply lacking spark and punch."
" Charming, somewhat authentic
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,7,"Takes a hot button issue and deals with it in a genuine manner. A thoughtful approach that sends a message that it's not something to play around with, but it is a necessary step that needs to be taken.The grandma constantly reminding the audience that she's an asshole is unnecessary. I'm tired of the trope of ""a jerk with a low-key heart of gold."" I feel like her being so aware took away from the naunce of the role. Plus it's hard to imagine and doesn't make sense for the grandma to have been any other way given the relationship with her daughter prior to Violet's death. Also, Elle had no chemistry with her love interest.Sage's mom felt like the most authentic character. Well written, behavior made sense.Sage herself was kinda annoying. She behaved immaturely for the most part but had such maturity about her pregnancy? Also the several scenes of her dry heaving? They've could've left out.Overall, it was an entertaining, interesting film. Despite it's problems, I felt glad that I watched it and would recommend it to others. May start some conversations."
" Mistaking aggression for assertiveness
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,1,"Consider the following situations and if you can distinguish between aggressive behaviour and assertive dignity.Situation 1: you go to your favorite cafe, to enjoy a well deserved latte. You want to enjoy some stress-free time, either alone or in company, but there is an elderly, loud woman discussing private matters with her companion at the top of her lungs. You don't care about her life story and are relieved when an employee asks the woman to leave. However, she makes a scene and drip her coffee all over the floor before exiting.Would you consider that woman well-adjusted, assertive and polite or angry, peevish, maladjusted, annoyingly rude and possibly a bully?Situation 2: you get into serious trouble and need $500. You ask many people for a loan, without success. Finally somebody lends you the money. You get your issue fixed, then meet your friend and the first thing you say is ""You'd be a nice person if you weren't such an ass***"".Whatever happened to being grateful? Should't you apologise for being as stupid as ending up in serious trouble, without any way out, except the money you borrowed?In this pathetic movie we're supposed to root for the two above mentioned characters: an elderly, angry, arrogant, pushy woman who in normal circumstances would be considered a bully and her silly, undignified, equally arrogant granddaughter. Together they own nothing and can resort only to begging to get some cash. Yet, they show no humility or gratitude and parade around as if in possession of the ultimate truth: spitting to the face of the whole world at large.Despicable characters and silly movie that glorify them."
" Funny little story...
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,9,"A funny little story about a grandmother who helps her granddaughter abort or (kill depending on what side of the aisle your on) her great grandchild. It's so funny, no one seems to want this baby. The father doesn't want anything to with it, the pregnant mother's concern is that she might go to hell for the abortion and her mother a high powered executive doesn't want it either and of course ""Grandma"" (Tomlin) well, she says no too - but ""I'll help you get the cash.""There is a hilarious part in the movie where Tomlin who has recently paid off all her debts and has no cash to pay for the abortion decides to go to an old boyfriend and lie to him about why she needs money. Eventually she comes clean and for some reason the guy won't loan her the money to abort her great grandchild. Weird huh?The film has a happy and timely ending. The mother ends up going to an ATM and hands over the cash to have her grandchild aborted. The big surprise is when the girl's mother shows up at the clinic and the it becomes a family event.Intertwined with all this mischief is a side story about Tomlin's lesbian lover.You'll laugh, you'll cry you'll wonder why and how a movie about people who are completely self centered can be this funny! A grate movie!"
" Interesting
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,7,"This is a movie about a young girl who got pregnant by a dead beat that wants an abortion. She doesn't have the money, doesn't want to go to her mom, so she goes to her grandma. Her grandma doesn't have money but takes her around trying to get the money for it. That's the whole premise and their interactions and how negative the grandma is all the time. In general I like it but at times she became a bit much. The young girl who plays Ruth in Ozark is excellent though as well."
" One to watch
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,8,Loved this movie so much. Characters are amazing and such a good feel movie.
" Tomlin at her best
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,9,"In an unnamed U.S. city (probably somewhere in California), the viewer spends a day in the life of Elle Reid (Lily Tomlin) and her teenage granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) as they try to raise money to terminate Sage's unwanted pregnancy.At times, Elle describes herself as ""an asshole"" and proves this declaration to be true. This is evident in how she treats her younger female lover in the opening scene. Prior to this relationship, her beloved long-time partner (also a woman) of nearly forty years had died. As a writer/poet, she is fascinating as well as cantankerous. As brilliantly portrayed by Tomlin, Elle is someone we would not want to encounter in life but are willing to enjoy watching from a safe distance.The film's structure is like a road-movie even if it takes place within the same city, visiting various people in the lives of the two women. Most visits are to people of Elle's past. Through her encounters with them, the viewer is like Sage in that we all learn more about Elle through these visits.Some scenes are broad comedy (like Elle's grand exit from a coffee shop) but Tomlin keeps it engaging. The best scene of the film is when Elle visits Karl (Sam Elliott). Elliott meets Tomlin head-on as they both reach the heights of great acting in this brilliant scene. They are well served by a fine script by director/writer Paul Weitz. Like other scenes, this one reveals just barely enough information about the past without being blunt. The writing trusts the viewers' intelligence to put the pieces together and it pays off..The screenplay works well in other ways such as irreverent humour. Some casual and inappropriate comments are made about the touchy subject of abortion. This would fail in most other stories but here, they seem to get away with it. There's also humour from the woman between Elle and Sage in the family tree: a type-A personality who seems to live off caffeine. As played by Marcia Gay Harden, she's a true (but thankfully rare) character that is very recognizable. Her humanity also shows in later scenes.Yet further praise can be given for how the story's vibe seems to include a strong presence of an invisible character: Elle's deceased partner who helped raise her daughter. The lingering grief is moving whenever the loved one is recalled.Here's yet another reason to praise ""Grandma"": we often hear of big-budget Hollywood films that boast an ""all-star cast"" in which only one woman is listed among the six or seven men. In those cases, the lone female must resemble a supermodel and act like a sex object in order to justify her presence in the movie. Compare this to ""Grandma"": the two leads are both female and one is a septuagenarian (and a highly energetic one at that) and most of the supporting roles are also female. They also resemble regular people. The presence of such characters is so welcome as it is so rare.I know I'd still love this movie even if I wasn't biased so here's the bias: ever since I saw Lily Tomlin's oddball characters on TV, I've believed (and still believe) that she is the greatest all-time entertainer. To see her at her very best in nearly every scene, ""Grandma"" was a gift from heaven.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Acting by Lily Tomlin"
" Grandkids
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,8,This movie just shows how much a grandmother would do for their grandchildren. Lily Thomas play is an awesome row is Grandma and I don't know the granddaughter's name but she also plays an awesome role .
" Mediocre and a waste of time
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,1,"Tamplin's is just dialing this in , her acting was hammy at times. The script was light and missed the opportunity of an interesting premise."
" OK: But just a few more points
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,6,"Enjoyable and interesting enough (for free on TV). Another user review mentioned a number of small bits that took them out of it - not funny enough, and not realistic enough for a movie that is to be taken essentially as realistic, not a SNL skit - like the hockey stick incident and the face punch one. I agree. The whole film was a bit shoddy that way and a bit random.The ex-boyfriend was later described as a creep etc. by Sage's mother. His worthlessness was way overdone in about 100 ways to the point where it detracted from Sage's character to have had him as a sort-of boyfriend (the kind you have sex with when you are maybe a junior in high school, and lots of times. Any non-idiot teen age girl would have known better. He didn't seem to have a single redeeming characteristic, like being really cute or funny or charming or intelligent. He was the opposite. A lot of the plot contrivances were a little forced in order to keep them going to the end to get the money. And why this particular clinic for $600? Grandma takes Sage to what turns out to be a free clinic that isn't there any more. Did no one think of calling that big famous nationwide organization with 15 clinics in Los Angeles?And one more gripe - one I also had about Hidden Figures. If a plot point is car problems, how about talking to a mechanic so they actually make sense? Why did the car have a low battery to start with, and then after what is later diagnosed as a bad crankshaft did it suddenly make the low battery starter sound and not restart after driving far enough on the freeway to keep it charged, and why was the engine also smoking? If it was actually low enough on oil to cause that problem as the mechanic later referred to it would have been making a whole lot more racket first. And she agrees to have him put in a new crankshaft. That would mean really rebuilding the whole engine or finding a new one, which would cost a couple thousand dollars and she doesn't have any money. And he mentioned something about keeping oil in it and it seems like she didn't. Why make her so careless with Violet's baby? By the way, I'm no mechanic but just have a basic knowledge of how cars work and what old ones are like. All this is similar to other shoddiness in this film, although maybe more expected in a little knocked out indie than in Hidden Figures. Grandma's car was the now deceased Violet's and you could see why Grandma might want to hold onto it - although no mention of where her car went. It's LA. She must have had one. Typically for this film there was no explanation of why she would have had a 1955 Dodge in 2013. This could have been an interesting thing about her and fill in her pretty much nonexistent character description but was skipped, like a lot of things. The actual reason the 1956 Dodge was in the film is that it is Lily Tomlin's car. You would think that with her money she might get the cracked side window and bent hood corner fixed on this otherwise nice collector car. Anyway, it's still OK and has its good points. See it if you like this sort of film."
" Came In Strong Towards the End
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,7,"In the opening scenes of this financially challenged flick ""Grandma"" under the direction of Paul Weitz, I swore I was going to show my disdain for it. But after a while, I started to progressively get into it as the characters kind of became easy to relate with as their stories drew its attention to its audiences making it all the more easier to watch. It's a rare finding to see a film where the film is sinking in expectations in the beginning only to emerge later on the film, but ""Grandma"" is one of those exceptions. Lily Tomlin is the leading performer as Elle Reid, a cynical smarmy, foul-mouthed lesbian poet, who before the film starts has just broken up with her girlfriend (Judy Greer) after courting for four months. In an attempt to vent out her frustration, she regards her lover as nothing more than a footnote. Shortly after this messy breakup, she gets a visit from Sage (Julia Garner), her granddaughter who needs some much needed cash to go with her abortion but is too afraid to ask her intimidating mother Judy (the always incredible and fearful Marcia Gay Harden). Elle is also low on dough, but still takes Sage along for a rough and wild ride to get some old allies to see if they could conjure up a few bucks that they owe her.The opening scenes were quite eye-catching, but the early scenes were placed as just an excuse to have Tomlin's Elle to churn out the laughs by embarrassing Sage in one situation after the next. They visit a coffee shop that was once a clinic for women facing similar problems as Sage's and sure enough Elle causes a scene by loudly exploiting the high costs of abortions which leads Elle get into a verbal sparring match with an unfortunate worker named Chau (John Cho). They visit the diner where her ex Olivia works, which results in a myriad of childish verbal abuse and condescending insults. They come to a tattoo parlour and the tattoo artist (Laverne Cox) isn't strong in her finances, but offers Elle a new tattoo. Tomlin is truly a great legend in comedy that traces back to the 1960's, but sadly here she seems reduced to just playing the type-cast sassy grandma.It's just that we've seen this way too many times in movies where old-timers get involved in awkward situations and are doing it just to get a laugh from their audience. And to make it more appalling they force the comedy down our throats with that awful pizzicato scores in the background.By the time Elle gets to visit one of her rare relationships with her ex-husband Karl (Sam Elliott), whom she was estranged with for 30 years before discovering that her true affection is with women, this movie starts to pick up. To see her go so far as to visit the man she kept herself apart for so long clearly points out she's low on options to get money while reminiscing awful memories about their troubled past.Even though his role is very brief, Elliott truly brings out the best in his performance and truly shows that less could mean more Elliott brings a lot of depth, emotional pain and nuance to his role he is the character that garners the most sympathy from. After all the superficial and forceful humour depicted here, Elliott turns the table with a more real and raw turn that has a dramatic edge to the film. Elle starts to change on me as we see her transform from a sitcom like geriatric to a more humane character we could all relate to. Even when the film returns to the madcap silliness, I have become more invested in her character. Sure abortion is a subject matter that is very sensitive to grasp at, it will surely spark divinity in how this situation is handled. One thing for sure, Sage is not going to change her mind about going through this difficult procedure. What makes this film so unique is that every character has a differing opinion of this heavy-handed subject matter, but it's handled in a mature perspective, even if the comical elements tell you otherwise.There are no villains in how one feels about abortion which is refreshing in itself. The other trait that makes this film unique is that it goes along with Sage's decision without being judgmental even though the baggage she carries with her is something she'll have to deal with.The midway comeback in this movie isn't strong on unpredictability. The closing scenes are cliched with sentimental vibes and moral lessons we would expect from a standard comedy-drama. However, the emotions will surely tug at your heartstrings and hope that all ends well for the characters in the film once it ends. It's truly a film one could treasure and feel good about after watching it."
" Short but wonderful
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,8,"Lily Tomlin is ""Grandma"" in this 2015 film, written and directed by Paul Weitz. Let's start with some trivia. For those who remember ""Imitation of Life"" from 1959, Paul Weitz is the son of Susan Kohner, who played the young woman who passed for white in the film. His grandfather was a famous theatrical agent, Paul Kohner, and his grandmother was actress Lupita Tovar.Tomlin plays Elle, a lesbian with a checkered past which includes a one-night stand that produced a daughter (Marcia Gay Harden), an ex- husband (Sam Elliott), a deceased lover who helped raise her daughter, and a young lover (Judy Greer) whom she's in the process of breaking up with when the film starts.Elle's granddaughter Sage (Julia Garner) visits her seeking $600 for an abortion. Elle doesn't have it. She's paid off all her debt and then cut up her credit cards. So the two go on a search for the money, hitting up the baby daddy, a friend (Laverne Cox), and another friend (Elizabeth Pena) with a cafe who offered to buy some first editions. In the end, Elle comes up short. Then it's time to hit up the ex- husband. This is where we find out Elle hasn't told her granddaughter everything about her life.The next stop is a confrontation with Sage's very busy mother who is on the outs with Elle.Entertaining and fun film, well written, well directed, and well acted. Lily Tomlin is delightful as a no-nonsense, dry-witted woman still grieving over the loss of someone so special in her life. Really a wonderful role for her.The rest of the cast is marvelous, with Marcia Gay Harden proving again that she's uber-talented. Weitz's quirky casting truly elevates this film.Highly recommended."
" Sam Elliot's best performance ever!!
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,10,"Sam Elliott was just amazing in this! I have loved the depth and the humility in the warmth and the humor that he brought through with his character. I really feel like it was an Oscar worthy performance and a movie that probably won't be seen by as many people as it could be. I hope we see this performance in another movie with Mr. Elliott because it would be super nice to see him win an Oscar for this caliber of performance. Overall this movie was a little bit hard for me to watch because I am pro-life and pro choice, politically. I think ideally we have to respect that it's a woman's choice and yet offer so many fabulous options that they would not feel like they ever had to do that. I am looking back and wondering if this even got any mentions for awards?"
" Disappointing
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,2,"I gave it a 2 only because the acting was so good. However - yes a big however. I am a feminist,I am a radical feminist in fact. But I find a movie that treats abortion with such disregard as disturbing, disappointing and inhumane. Having worked in an abortion clinic - it is the most difficult decision any woman has to make. And to make it so unimportant as an issue with so much talent around it, it is really unfortunate. Not just the issue of abortion, but the issue of how women treat each other with so much anger and baggage and a man writes and directs it. Typical in a way. Sorry for Lily such a huge talent to be a part of this is disturbing. She is bigger and better than the flippant way many woman issues are addressed. The film never goes into any depth with any one character. It is a good idea as a script, how one life touches many and many touches one - but all in all, deeply disappointing. I don't want to go into too many specifics because then, if you haven't seen the film, the story line will be given away. And I don't like doing that or having that done to me.When will women write real films about real women and touch upon such sensitive issues with the sensitivity integrity and honesty that it deserves without depending upon the male point of view that in fact almost belittles everything that makes women women and lesbians lesbians and human dynamics, more human."
" A touching experience
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,7,"This movie is about a teenager facing an unplanned pregnancy which leads her to go to her grandmother for help(due to the fear of the reaction her mother might give about the situation). The movie is divided into chapters, which in starting I didn't know. Lily Tomlin just did a great job acting as a grandmother with a difference. In all the movie just touches your heart and I hope more movies of the same kind come soon."
" Not a comedy, only a mild drama, boring but good acting
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,3,"This was a sad use of good acting. Although Lily Tomlin delivers brilliant acting with excellent character development, there's nothing else to this film. It's rather boring, over all with not much to the story line, there's minimal plot, at best. What's really disappointing is that IMDb listed this ad a comedy first. I'm not sure why it's listed as a comedy at all, it's in no way humorous."
