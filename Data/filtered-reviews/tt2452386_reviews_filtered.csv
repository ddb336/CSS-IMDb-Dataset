" Bad scenario
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,3,"Nothing interesting latterly, lazy writers. The story was too boring and expanded."
" I don't understand the low critical score
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,10,"This was an incredibly good movie. It's the sort of film I don't normally watch, but the trailer on Netflix hooked me and I decided to give it a chance. Craig Roberts and Paul Rudd were amazing. Selena Gomez surprised me. I came to truly love those three characters and really care how it turned out. And that last line at the end was priceless.The performances weren't super dramatic or wildly intense overall. Which is certainly more like real life. But that wasn't what hooked me (I'm not usually into ""real life"" movies). It was more that the characters were so believable and relatable. And the story was just so engaging and you were rooting for everyone to have a happy ending (or at least a satisfying one).I was so caught up in the characters and the story that I truly kind of lost myself in the watching. That's when I know I'm seeing something really good.Watch it! You'll like it!"
" Gets you in the first 10 minutes
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,9,Craig Roberts is an absolute gem in this loved the tricks he plays and the chemistry is Stella.
" Perfect mix of comedy, sadness and a hint of romance!
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"Beautiful but hilarious movie. I hadn't read much on this before reading but was pleasantly surprised. Without being biased, amazing acting from both Robert's and Rudd. It had me belly laughing, and also shedding tears. Very uplifting movie with a deep kind of storyline to it too. Would definitely recommend to most."
" Simple, funny and emotional
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,9,"A movie packed with just as many smiles as tears. Perfectly balanced, not over done. Didn't realize I'll love this movie this much, before watching it.Highly recommended."
" Great movie! What more can I say, accept ALOHA.
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,10,"I simply loved this movie. It hit all the buttons; It was a funny, nail biter that brought tears to my eyes. Great characters, all were lovable in their own way. I strongly recommend that you watch this movie. You won't be disappointed!"
" Feelgood road trip movie
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,8,"It is a film you've seen before, but the details are what matters and in this they create a pleasant feelgood road trip. Paul Rudd actually played his role really well, with a depth that you only realize after the film is over. So what is it about? This kid has muscular dystrophy and needs care, so Rudd's character takes the job and then convinces the otherwise recluse kid to go on a drive to see some random sightseeing landmarks he was fantasizing about. On the road they meet some people that they take along and live life fuller, finding themselves.What probably differentiates this film from so many others in the category is that there is no artificial drama somewhere in the third act, some threat or some unexpected catastrophe that makes it all tense. It just progresses naturally and makes the characters shine. There is no big moral at the end, nothing gets solved, it's just a story of personal growth. Probably the weakest link was Peaches, who had the potential to be a more complex character, but in the end had just a few scenes. Hopefully the book does her justice.In the end, good job for a movie in a genre I usually care (heh!) nothing about."
" Really, a non-disabled actor?
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,4,"Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts did great performances.
However, I was immediately off out by the fact that they didn't cast a disabled actor. There are so few opportunities for physically disabled actors and the perfect one comes along and the casting director passes?I also found the dialog to be narrow minded and Selena Gomez'a acting to be just awful. More people felt sorry for Craig Robert's character than not and quickly made comments like ""What's wrong with him?"". He also just decided to not use a medical device at a given moment which I thought was a weird way to communicate his confidence.I agree with those that say this is a feel-good movie but there were major negatives. The writers had so many opportunities to better represent a minority community and missed the mark with the social components."
" Wow.... I wasn't expecting that.
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,8,"Great movie! I was really impressed with the cast. Well acted movie with a great story. I wasn't expecting much from Selena Gomez, but she did a great job. One of the best roles I've seen Paul Rudd in! Craig Roberts did an amazing job as well. The chemistry with all of the characters was there and it made you care about them. Great drama/comedy."
" U shud watch this movie
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,9,"This beautiful movie is directed by Rob Burnett and written by Rob Burnett. it's a drama and comedy film based on the novel: The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving that was written by Jonathan Evison. The movie was released 27 June in 2016 on the streaming site Netflix. The movie has been nominated 3 times: Edinburgh International Film Festival and in Georgia Film Critics Association. for Audience Award, Best International Feature Film and Oglethorpe Award for Excellence in Georgia CinemaThe story is about a caregiver who was a writer named Ben Benjamin (acted by Paul Rudd) who took the job to help a teenager named Trevor(acted by Craig Roberts) who has a disease named: Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The disease makes him unable to walk and use all his fingers. It also can be dangerous if he doesn't get his treatment. Trevor has very dark humor and often pranks people around him that he's dead. But still, he hasn't gotten out of his house on more than one flight from the UK to the USA and that was because He and his mum needed to move. The plot of the movie is that Ben is trying to run away from his wife who tries to divorce him. So Ben comes up white id√©n that they are going on a road trip to the world's deepest pit and Trevor's dad who works as a gardener. Elsa Trevor's mum who works at a bank is very proactive and doesn't like the idea of letting her son go. But Ben persuades her. The next day Ben and Trevor get in the van and start driving. On the way, they met Dot and Peaches.Dot (acted by Selina Gomez) is a girl who wants to go to Denver to start her new life and Ben asks if she wants to go white theme. She says yes and the next day they met Peaches who got stock by the highway. Peaches is a pregnant woman who wants to visit her mum in Nebraska. on the way, they learn the importance of friendship and hope. One thing to is that you need to take chances or life will be boring and meaningless. One of Trevor's dreams is that he wants to pee while he's standing and that reminds us that something that is ovarian to some of us is a dream and unavailable for others.I think the movie is for an older audience like those over 13 years old and older. because it has some mature jokes in it that younger people wouldn't understand and the jokes bring much to the movie. In the movie, you have many different characters making it easy to relate to and that's one of the things that makes it a fantastic movie. And also I don't think anybody dislikes the movie, so I definitely should recommend this movie.I love this movie because it has a lovely message and pretty good acting, it sometimes overplays but it's barely noticeable. The humor in the movie is high class and the jokes always hit in a funny way. The second mistake I spot is that they don't follow the rodde sometimes like they can teleport. One sen tay are in oregon and in sen thay are in montana, then they are in oregon again. But besides that it's almost a perfect movie and just how easy to relate to.I would give the movie 9/10. I did not think it was a masterpiece because it's my favorite genre and in fact it is bassett on a book takes away the creativity. I highly recommend watching this movie if you haven't watched it yet."
" I loved this movie!!
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,10,"I was not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. This is a heartfelt movie that has it all-good writing, storyline, and acting. It is a touching story that you should not miss."
" Phenomenal film
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,10,"I cannot believe I had never heard of this movie before. Paul Rudd outdid himself. Incredible film. All amazing performances, so funny. Full of heart. Selena Gomez was amazing too. Great great movie. All must see. Spread the word so everyone can see this amazing movie."
" This film deserves a better release
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"Such a diamond of a film.
Paul Rudd is great, the storyline is great. Should have the same success that a "" little miss sunshine"" had. Worth a watch or two!"
" Lighthearted funny movie
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"The movie is very funny and the actor's performances were so good and felt real. The storyline was good and the pacing of the movie felt good, it doesn't feel long at all and it's easy to absorb. My only problem with the movie is that Katy perry exists but Selena Gomez doesn't? Not actually I just got distracted by her being there and her acting/character wasn't strong enough to keep me from getting annoyed. Also all the royalty-free music was awful, so I'm glad they didn't use it all the time. Watch if you wanna have a good laugh along with going out with a good message :D"
" Do it Just do it.
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,10,My first review ever. I love movies have always loved movies. As a 5 year old give me a black and white over a cartoon. Almost 50 years in disability work and never have I ever seen a film portray more honestly the realities of being a caregiver. Watch it. Just watch it
" Must watch
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,10,Amazing film and so funny. The relationship between thr guys is amazing so heart warming
" My first review.
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,10,"I've never felt the need to review a movie as much as I have after watching The Fundamentals of Caring and seeing the metacritic reviews.
I've never been on such an emotional ride like I have with this movie. The characters are extremely engaging and you feel attached to their stories, even the shorter characters in the film. The film is filled with belly aching laughs but the real heart of the story is the sadness the characters feel that they help each other overcome.
There are moments in the film where even the most hardened emotionally viewers will find a lump in their throat.I loved every second of it and was sad and happy to see it end."
" Sooo positive movie
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,10,"Watch it and thank me later.This movie is not about light and the gear they used it. It's about life, accepting, loving and carrying all people in a world."
" Brilliant heartfelt film
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,9,"Paul Rudd has been well known for his comedy roles and even in Ant Man it has lot of humour. In ways this can be funny too but its strength is the relationship between his character Ben and Trevor (Craig Roberts) as they travel across country together and making so memories. It hits a few emotional strings in a very uplifting way, I highly recommend watching"
" Great movie
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,This movie was a pleasant surprise to me. Paul Rudd was very good in this one and all the supporting cast.
" amazing film
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Not only did i enjoy this film so much, the acting of the main character is immaculate and the perfect fit for his role. This film definitely brought me to tears with the most heartwarming ending. Despite the main characters situation in life he makes the best out of it with his sense of humor, and you get very attached as you see the raw emotions he ends up showing later on in the film. This movie is definitely on my top 10!"
" Wonderful Movie
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,Absolutely loved this. Everything just seemed so right. Encourage everyone to try the movie
" One of the best movies I have ever seen
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,10,I LOVE this movie. I have watched it at least 10 times in the past few years and it never gets old. The acting is brilliant. The story is brilliant. I laugh and cry every time I see it.
" Best friendship movie in years
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,8,"There is so little to not like about this movie. The relationships aren't forced, they progress over time and mature as they go.Rudd is characteristically appealing. But everyone around him manages to keep their own distinctiveness throughout. It's not Rudd with supporting actors. It's a cast of people you just start to like equally as they participate in the story.It's a movie I've watched a few times and enjoyed with each viewing."
" I Watched the Entire Movie Without Moving a Muscle'
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,The story and acting were awesome. I wish there were more like this one. I'd never heard of it and just wandered on to it by accident. First time I've ever seen Selena in a movie and was she ever good. Thank you Netflix. You scored a thousand per cent with this one. I'm ready for a road trip to see the deepest hole in the earth.
" Definitely on my list of favorite movies
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,10,I was looking for a movie to watch one night on Netflix and came across this one. I expected it to be an average movie but it was actually really funny. The plot wasn't too cheesy and it was full surprises. I really enjoyed it.
" fun and emotional
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,7,Nice story of a reluctant carer learning the ropes with a disabled teenager. Good fun and keeps you interested.
" I wanted to like it but
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,5,"I've inadvertently seen this exact inspiration porn -type of movie so many times, it couldn't offer anything I didn't see coming a mile away. The actors did a great job for the most part with what they had (except for Trevor's fathers scene, what in the world was that even supposed to be? ) but the script didn't really give them very much to work with. The direction and sound are very cutesy too, adding to the extremely saccharine feeling thats only cut by a couple crude jokes (that really weren't that funny or shocking to begin with) being repeated over and over again.It might be a good movie for a teenager or an option for someone who is emotionally in turmoil or unable to invest into an actual story and thus needs something familiar and comforting, but for someone looking for any meaningful content I urge to look elsewhere."
" OK-ish version of Will Hunting + Untouchable
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,5,A movie to watch for leisure for daily fun. Not to be watched seriously.Not particularly original or touching or any kind. OK Warming.Passable.Father/parent-children as the central theme. Personally quite like this genre.
" An Entertaining Comedy-Drama
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,10,"An Entertaining Comedy-Drama
When I read Netflix's synopsis about The Fundamentals of Caring, I did not expect much from the movie. Given the somber premise, I thought it to be an incredibly mushy, overly emotional film. I have to say the movie exceeded my expectations greatly.First of all, The Fundamentals of Caring does well to avoid the tropes that one normally associates with the genre of the buddy comedy. It also pokes fun at the clich√©d movie ""disabled"" person, one who is either larger than life or depressed with his life. What we get are two very original characters, Ben (played by Paul Rudd) and Trevor (played by Craig Roberts), who are just ordinary human beings.As original and well-written Ben and Trevor's characters may be, Dot (played by Selena Gomez) is not at all well-developed throughout the movie's run. More than Ben, Dot is the character that inspires Trevor to push past his limits and jump over his self-imposed hurdles. Although this is a crucial part of the story, the character herself does not contribute much other than blank expressions and explicit dialogues. This is both a fault of Gomez and of the movie's writers, as the character could either have developed so much more throughout the movie, or she could have had a smaller role in the scope of the movie.While the movie gets off to a strong start, it does not maintain this momentum as it progresses forward. It would have been beneficial for the writers to have stretched the movie's run-time in order to develop the climax more, as it felt incredibly rushed. While increasing the movie's run-time runs the risk of making the movie ""too long,"" I find that a movie that is too short in length sabotages its chance of leaving a lasting impact on its audience.Despite the flaws in the writing of the movie, I found that Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts were phenomenal as Ben and Trevor. Paul Rudd is normally known for his comic roles in movies like Anchorman and Antman. However, he manages to deliver a natural, sincere performance as Ben, a grief stricken caregiver. It is in the quiet, subtle moments of the movie that Rudd manages to convey Ben's suffering and what he's going through. It is these moments that demonstrate that Rudd has a great deal of acting range if it's channeled by his directors.While I have been familiar with Rudd's work, I was not at all familiar with Craig Roberts' work. I recognized him from his small roles in 22 Jump Street and Neighbors (And I had no idea he was British!), but not much else. This movie definitely shows what he's capable of as an actor, and I hope it serves as a suitable launch pad for future roles in his career. His portrayal of Trevor definitely surpassed my expectations, as he gave the character a sense of humanity and avoided going for the clich√©s.Overall, I would recommend The Fundamentals of Caring to anyone who appreciates a good comedy-drama. While the movie is not perfect, it features two leading actors who are at the top of their game."
" Good Sense Of Humour, Epic Comedy ever
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,10,"Very rarely do I get attached to characters like I did in this film
First of all, I'd like to say that I am a fan of character development. Many good movies aren't great because their characters lack a real sense of attachment. The fundamentals of caring nails it on the head. Paul Rudd is a work of art in this film and quite frankly that surprised me. Selena Gomez pleasantly perfected her role as well which surprised me even more. I am not placing any spoilers but I will tell you that it shouldn't matter what type of movies you typically enjoy, you SHOULD enjoy this one. I am a 23 year old female, and an Army Vet so you would expect a guy like me to be into more manly macho movies. Well you'd be right. But as a fan of art and emotion, I respect movies like this. You will feel a way with the story that brings you everything from joy, laughter, pain, guilt and even fear. Its an emotional roller-coaster ride and I'll be riding it again in the front seat every time. Must watch movie hands down. I'll even say you should subscribe to Netflix even if it's only for one month just to see this movie. This definitely makes its way on my top 10, easily."
" Loved it, dark humour at its finest
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,9,"Genuinely enjoyed this movie, the twists, punks and emotion all hits you when it needs to, you love all characters in this, the chemistry is off the charts, I see and understand Selena could've toned down the language a bit but think the rough street smart was the mix needed with these characters. I'd say the only thing that held it down was maybe not doing quite enough to explain the disease, it did say lifespan etc just felt a bit more could've been done.Awesome watch though and genuinely hilarious. Perfect casting"
" Perfection!
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,10,"I have never ever wrote a review on a movie so making this my first is an achievement!!I gotta say the movie is well constructed! I loved how they saved the part on Ben's story for the last part it made me want to know what happened so bad and the part where Ben pranked Trevor at the hotel got me so anxious and relieved when he said he was joking haha! Mixed emotions in this movie really grabs you in it and see from the characters perspective and I gotta say Trevor's behavior made the character really sophisticating but i'm glad that Ben as his friend and caregiver chose to stand by him and not give up is really wholesome. And by the ending when they got home I really wished that i got to see more of their bond and how Trevor's mom would appreciate Ben for really standing his ground on helping Trevor fulfill his dreams hence the situation he's in and I also really wanted to see what happened in his 21st Birthday haha!! But overall this movie made me laugh and right in the feels this movie is just mind-blowing and made me realize how lucky I am that I am able and also thankful for the people like Ben in my life who hasn't given up on me yet even if I myself can say, it is totally in for a sequel!!"
" Goes to show that simple can be very enjoyable
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,8,"A damaged middle aged man is employed to look after a disabled, acid tongued young man.
As there inevitable friendship blooms they take a road trip where they encounter a bunch of waif and strays.Sound familiar?
It should.
But that doesn't stop this from being a funny, entertaining, heart-warming movie.Paul Rudd is right at home (basically playing Paul Rudd) and everyone else is very well cast and give great performances.There is nothing new here but, despite the theme, it is the kind of film that washes away the troubles of the day for an hour or so and makes you feel grateful, rather than guilty, for what you have.The story is simple and the comedy is not particularly clever but it all just works.
I think it is great that sometimes a new film can accept that the worn trails are there for a reason and build on them rather than charging off in to the wilderness."
" Fundamentals of boo-yah!
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,8,"Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend.I like a good ""road trip"" trope, and crossing it with a disability trope doesn't take anything out of it. Instead of the handicap being something that prevents the story (despite them actively saying so, repeatedly), it accents it. Yeah, he can't climb stairs, but that doesn't actually prevents him from getting to a 2nd floor, it's just the way they go about it is different, and this style of writing is throughout the movie. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is another good example if you're trying to think of something.Paul Rudd does a lot of the work in this movie, playing well with Craig Robets from his chair, but each character is necessary and specific in their design, they each add something special to the mix to create this refined story of dark death and dick jokes.While I'm sure some fine the humor juvenile, the story is a juvenile story: it's about letting a (disabled) juvenile do something that a (non-disabled) juvenile would do."
" has it all
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,10,Usually im not a fan of anything that has drama in it but this movie takes you on a trip filled with feelings from the dark humor that i love to awkward interactions between characters to building up their relationships and setting the story direction takes a great pace
" Wow!!
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,10,Well. I only put this movie on as something to have on in the background whilst hubby dozed on the sofa. Needless to say. He didn't doze. It was funny. Heart warming. 3 dimensional we both loved it. All the actors did an amazing job but there was a real connection between the 2 leads. Paul Rudd as usual nailed the role. And what a fantastic future the young actor has.
" Much more than just a ¬¥road trip¬¥
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,8,"I hadn¬¥t heard of that film, maybe had I not paid attention or was it eclypsed by higher budget ones who benefited from a great promotion.
Anyway, it was an extremely pleasant surprise to me. I had seen Paul Rudd in a couple of films but that¬¥s it. Mainly in comedies. I knew he was talented but I had never seen him in a serious role. He appeared to me to be really good.
I had only seen Jennifer Ehle in Pride and Prejudice so it was nice to see her again in the role of the fragile mother who has to keep strong to take care of her son. I wished she had had more scenes but it makes sense that she wouldn¬¥t as the film is not really about the mother.
Then comes Craig (sorry I forgot his last name) who plays the role of the teenager who has DMD, a disability that prevents him from walking. I was afraid during his first scene that it would be about showing the misery of being disabled and that this film would be about making us cry but no. His role is a very realistic one. He appears to be like many teenagers, sarcacstic, playful, sensitive, and we simply end up wanting to take care of him.
The role held by Selena Gomez is also very interesting. She plays a slightly rough yet touching rebel and, as I read in another critic, she simply owns the character.
The only part that I think we could have ¬¥lived without¬¥ was the one of the pregnant woman. The reason for her presence was not obvious to me at first, even far-fetched, but I understood it in one of the last scenes, which I actually did not like that much as it was a bit too made in¬¥Hollywood¬¥ for me.
This is for the actors and the characters.
Now, the story is quite simple: Paul Rudd decides to become a carer as his marriage is ending and he lost his son. He is therefore trying to find something to keep his mind busy. He is hired to take care of a disabled teenager who is constantly challenging his abilities to take care of him, until the day that he decides to challenge him to go on a road trip so he can learn to change his habits and grow.
As said it the title, it then becomes more than just a road trip, it is a journey through life with a disability, love, going through redemption, and caring for one another.
Touching."

" A great film

" Wow.

" a movie about a boy has DMD that worth watch it.
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,7,"These days I usually movies about people with disability.
The fundamentals of caring is one if them I've seen, by the way I have a disease same Trevor in the movie but with a little different.
Anyway I think the movie worse to watch it, It consider well about a person with disability who can have a unique sense of humor!, some times can be rude, shy in making a friend and ...
In my opinion the movie can't show very well a boy has DMD, because they have harder situation in this age.
But I recommend to watch it and after that google about Muscular Dystrophy and get some information about it! .p.s. Paul Rudd is one of my favorite actor, Phoebe's husband!"
" Grrrrrrrrreat Movie.

I really enjoyed and look forward to seeing it again."
" Solid
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,7,Great character development ... solid life takeaways and you felt entertained the whole time . I was engaged and wanting to know where it was taking the plot .The dynamic between the two main characters was believable and powerful. Bromance is such a great theme for any movie . I actually loved Selena Gomez in this . You left feeling good .A bit too much crude humor but besides that a solid film .
" The Fundamentals of Caring by Wayne J. Keeley
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,9,"Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all. -Helen KellerThis is a difficult review for me to write. Scratch that. This is probably one of the hardest reviews for me to write. The film The Fundamentals of Caring (FOC) is about a young man with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The disease is insidious in that is a progressive, muscle-wasting disease that affects approximately one in 3,500 male children. The prognosis is never good. Most children don't make it out of their teens alive. There is no cure. There is no treatment other than perhaps steroids which only serve to possibly prolong muscle life.My oldest son, Wyatt, has DMD.So it is with a heavy heart and a critical eye that I came to this film. Rob Burnett, probably best known in the industry for being the executive producer of the Late Show with David Letterman, wrote and directed the film. It was based on a novel The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving by Jonathan Evison. The film stars Paul Rudd, Craig Roberts, Selena Gomez, and Bobby Cannavale.Obviously, I have a love/hate relationship with the film and it is one that has been haunting me since I watched it. While somewhat predictable in plot, it is extremely powerful. Of course, thematically it goes well beyond the plight of just DMD sufferers and their caregivers and resonates with anyone facing a serious, debilitating illness. But this film is not only personal to those affected, but to their caregivers as well. Interestingly, caregiving is one of the jobs that novelist Evison lists in his bio.Fundamentals of CaringWith respect to DMD, the film is quite accurate. Almost all children affected by the disease are in a wheelchair by their pre-teens. There is a montage of shots showing the plethora of medicines and supplements that kids with the disease often take including deflazacort (a steroid comparable to prednisone given in the UK and Europe). The film also depicts sleeping with a BiPAP machine, a device used by the vast majority of the kids to facilitate breathing and sleeping. The only inaccuracy that I found were in the character Trevor's ability to move and raise his arms. Generally speaking, DMD sufferers who reach Trevor's age (twenty) cannot lift their arms. Additionally, his fingers would not be stiff and intractable. Indeed, for some inexplicable reason the disease does not affect small muscles in the eyes and fingers. Finally, if Trevor was on deflazacort, he would be significantly heavier. Even though deflazacort generally is known to have fewer side effects than prednisone, there would still be some weight gain.But these are knit-picky things and as a director and writer, I am cognizant that complete accuracy to real life with anything, much less the depiction of a deadly disease, is virtually impossible. The film works. That is the most important thing. If for no other reason, it works as a vessel for awareness for DMD. But, I am happy to say, it works on deeper levels as well. It represents a healing journey for all of the characters involved. Caregivers, like the people they care for, often are afflicted with their own demons and maladies. In fact, we all are journeymen and have our crosses to bear and frankly, life isn't fair. The film is both cathartic and inspirational.Without giving away too much, the story involves a writer, Ben, who, tortured by his own private demons, ends up taking a job as a caregiver to the snarky, disrespectful Trevor, a twenty-year-old afflicted with DMD. Trevor's dad left when he was diagnosed at three (a sadly common occurrence in DMD families) leaving his mother to pick up the pieces and carry on. Needless to say Trevor is bitter, sarcastic and, at times, irreverent. Who wouldn't be in his position? The number one item on his wish list is to pee standing up (yes, it's the little things in life). And speaking of pee, he manages to pee piss off every caregiver he has. It's initially a rocky road for Ben, but despite being warned not to, he develops a bond with Trevor. He plans a road trip with Trevor to visit the largest sink hole in the U.S. Along the way they pick up two female travelers: one a hitchhiker and the other a pregnant damsel in distress. Needless to say, the road trip is a metaphor for one's trip on the roller coaster known as life.Paul Rudd is an intense, insightful actor in every part he plays, whether it is the reluctant superhero in Ant-Man (see our review) or as the tortured soul in this film. He brings such a mix of vulnerability and strength to the role of Ben. Craig Roberts plays the DMD-afflicted Trevor to perfection. He captures and conveys the bitterness of his plight with the underlying quest for redemption and salvation. Selena Gomez was a wonderful surprise as Dot. She brought her formidable acting chops to the role and proved she has more than just a pretty face and a beautiful singing voice.Rob Burnett did a great job directing. There are no special effects, green screens, action sequences, etc. Just a story with real people in real situations with real flaws. All in all, it was a beautiful, haunting and engaging film. Please pay it forward."
" Superb
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,10,"This film is superb, I am fussy critic and I usually need dark gritty uncomfortable scenes for great reviews. But this really hit the spot, very dry humour, fantastic acting and a incredible humility and warmth to this film. Really superb. 10/10"
" Road trip
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,10,"I can't believe that this film has been on my to watch list for so long! Watch it, you won't be disappointed."
" Just what I needed
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,9,"This was recommended by my gal (who should consider investing in Kleenex). The story and actors we're great, and I laughed a lot, which doesn't hurt a bit. Don't miss it! Better than most"
" A passable comedy-drama anchored by the talented Paul Rudd
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,5,"This is a passable comedy-drama buddy-road trip picture. Paul Rudd plays Ben Benjamin, a ""retired writer,"" who is grieving from a personal tragedy. He becomes a caretaker for Trevor, a sassy, emotionally wounded teen with Duschene Muscular Dystrophy played by Craig Roberts. Robert's character can't move anything besides his hands and head, so he is in large part dependent on his caregiver Rudd, but that doesn't stop the incessent pranks Trevor pulls on Ben. It was tough for me to stick with the film because of the commercial and formulaic production style. The likeability, talent, and humanity of Paul Rudd as an actor is what kept me watching. In brief, Trevor leads a sheltered, regimented, limited life: a steady diet of crap TV; waffles and sausages for all three meals; handfuls of medications and supplements; a CPAP breathing mask over his face to sleep; a growing stack of unopened, unwanted letters from his father who abandoned him; and one three-hour visit to a park weekly. Sad stuff. What begins as a prank ends up materializing into a road trip in the Caretaker's van through the midwest to see cheesy natural wonder roadside attractions. Along the way they pick up Dot, a female teen runaway, (love interest for Trevor), played adequately by a fun Selena Gomez, and Peaches, a very pregnant, quirky woman played sweetly by Megan Ferguson. In the middle of struggling through this film, one of my favorite Leonard Cohen song played as part of the soundtrack; that song and the presence of Paul Rudd were the best parts of the film for me. If you like this type of ""feel good"" Hollywood fare or are a Paul Rudd fan, you'll probably enjoy this."
" Understated Perfection!
",2019-09-16 00:00:00,10,"Watching this movie is one and a half hours of complete relaxation and entertainment. It doesn't require a suspension of disbelief nor does it strain your expectations of reality. It is believable, funny, and slightly tragic. However, it is an enjoyable and uplifting movie.After watching this I have to see some other films that have Craig Roberts in them. This young man's acting is quite amazing.Without giving anything away...I would love to see some bloopers from this film, they must be hilarious!"
" In love with these people
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,9,Had no idea what to expect but this movie felt like a wonderful hug. I want to know all of these people. They can't just invite me in like this and then leave me stranded. Wonderful time with this film and will watch it again.
" not true to life!
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,5,"This movie is not true to life of a disabled person! Its happy all the time a barely shows the struggle. the disabled guy is always happy and never complains. I would have liked it if they showed that the disabled person was not just comedy relief. I would have liked it if they used a disabled person,they did not portray the condition right."
" My ""Ah Ha"" Moment from Fundamentals of Caring
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,10,"I read a lot of reviews about this movie written by some professional critics, some wannabe professional critics and some everyday people like myself. There were some big words used to describe simple things that I had to look up in the dictionary to figure out what the hell the reviewer was going on about. I read catch phrases such as ""a coming of age movie"" and ""road trip cliches"". None of that matters because this movie is not the kind you smack a label on, acronym to death or dismiss because you don't like Selena Gomez's comedic timing.This movie...this story... is several stories within one big story that anyone from any walk of life can find a piece of themselves in. Divorce, death of child, disabilities, low self esteem, lack of self worth, abuse, neglect, shame, absentee father, loss of parent, trying to find oneself, overcoming obstacles in life, stereotypes, war, soliders, forgiveness and on and on.You don't watch this kind of movie because Paul Rudd has great drama/comedy talent. You watch, listen, learn and takeaway from the story... your story, a friend's story, a stranger's story, anyone and everyone's story. Then when you least expect it you have your ""ah ha"" moment. For me...my ""ah ha"" moment? It's ok to be stuck for a moment like Ben, afraid of change and to leave my comfort zone like Trevor, determined to get to my Denver like Dot, to boast about my solider like Peaches and shake in my boots like Elsa at the thought of my ""baby"" going out into the world to experience life without me. For my daughter...just because your absentee father wasn't there for you in life it doesn't mean you didn't deserve better...hes the butthole...your still worth your weight in Gold and deserving of the love and support you received from your adoptive father.Give it an hour and a half, find your ""ah ha"" moment and share it with someone else. They'll be glad you did and you'll be better the person for it."
" Movie that makes you caring!
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,7,I really loved the way it told the story of a tow or three storyline altogether. I can't deny it's been an enjoyable watching for me though there I felt some miss connections...
" A beautiful movie about the fundamental of live
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,9,"Caring is sharing, and they did it each other.
They shared their lives, their pain, to become best friends. And if even no solutions have come so far, they improved and grew together within the rhythm of a funny sarcasm.
Life is out of the comfort zone and it must be lived not behind a window, but on the road where the best success can be to pee standing up. And you will discover how to care for someone makes you better, a free man, because what we give, is what we get.
Then sharing becomes caring.
A beautiful movie, with beautiful characters."
" Terrific Film with a Terrible Soundtrack
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,9,"Easily the most fantastic movie Paul Rudd has ever made! The characters are heartfelt and real, in spite of their flaws. The story is quirky, touching, and at times amusing - while the plot is a simple one, it was very cleverly developed so that the pace didn't drag. A triumph from start to finish, in spite of the music...which could have been so much better. It's rare for me to find myself living a movie if I hated the soundtrack. I'm happy to say this is a unique exception!"
" Engaging, Endearing, Quirky, Moving.
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,9,"Rarely does a movie snag me hook line and sinker like this one did. I was ready for something shallower and much less impressive, and found myself engrossed, in love with the characters and rooting for them as they navigate their shared journeys of self discovery. The story is surprisingly layered, and the performances natural and nuanced, to the point where I found myself quite emotionally involved. Heatwarming and refreshing - a great feel-good road movie with surprising depth."
" Surprised over how this one took me on an emotional level
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,8,"I've always loved paul Rudd, but ot a little tired of some of the movies he was in during the last years.This one saved it - it made me laugh, and even cry (very little), which was a surprise considering that i mostly watch these ""not blockbuster"" movies while doing chores at home. This one made me sit down until the end. Pleasant."
" Watchable.
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,4,"The Fundamentals of Caring has likable characters, it just doesn't deliver as a comedy and is unconvincing.Jennifer Ehle stood out in the limited appearance for me, as Trevor's mother. Because Trevor needs constant care and has no time to himself, I like how he has the poster on the living room wall and is watching some female television host as the norm. People seem to hate on Selena Gomez. Didn't mind her, the character's rather convenient for Trevor though."
" Just great
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,9,"It's funny, moving and sad with a few cliches thrown in, but a great watch."
" Very nice
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,7,"What a lovely movie.. funny, no drama, few emotions, that kind of movie for those chilling evenings when u just wanna eat some nice food with glass of wine and some nice relaxing movie ."
" The Fundamentals of a Story
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,9,"This film caught my soft spots in all the right places.
i didn't want to watch this movie for a long time, just saw it as a suggestion on my netflix page.oh boy was i wrong. please do yourself a favor and just watch it.a lovely and beautiful film with such realistic dialogue and character motives.Amazing delivery by the actors with a solid story and pacing.I don't usually fall for these types of movies but this one just hit me.
Maybe it will do the same for you."
" Just keep skiping until Selena Gomez gets into the scene XD
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,10,"The beginning was so boring but everything got more exciting with Selena's appearance :D and dont worry about the parts that you skipped, you will catch up, they retell the main parts after"
" Really really enjoyed this
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,9,"I am not usually into drama/comedy films i'm more of a horror girl but i love selena gomez so i have this a try, and boy i'm glad i did. this is such a heartfelt hilarious brilliant film and every cast member makes the film even better. i'm so happy i watched it and would 100% recommend it"
" I watched this on Netflix by Netflix
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,10,"How cool is that? lol, is Netflix making movies or are they like buying them, I don't get it but supporting art is way a nice thing to do so we can enjoy it. I know it is a Netflix film because on their site the tab to hit on a movie is way way more imposing in size compared to the other ""NON"" Netflix movies lol. But that saying they are really great, I loved this one because it was very sweet and cute and nice and adorable , tons of syrup please netflix? lol, but anyway, if you want to feel good and feel better about your day or life then watch this one, it will take you away for a little while so you can be OK, its like a drug but not as expensive and dangerous lol...."
" Surprisingly happy
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,10,"Life has a way of putting people in each other's lives, who help us in unexpected ways. This movie also helps us remember how thankful we should be & how much we can inspire others."
" Okay but forgettable
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,4,"Watchable dramedy. The actors did their part. The problems are...
script full of clich√©smediocre direction and editinggodawful, horribly composed music that calls attention to itself.The above situation is very common these days. The actors work their asses off but the powers that be don't do their part intelligently.You won't die if you watch this, it's okay for a Netflix movie. You also won't remember it the following day."
" Netflix Originals are gonna get better if they keep doing this.
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,7,"The Fundamentals of Caring is a good film. I've never seen Paul Rudd in a drama before, but he surely did nail this role. His character is a caretaker for children, and he starts caring for a handicapped boy who shares his thoughts about family. I've never seen a Netflix Original movie, excluding Calibre, that I can actually call: ""worth your time"". Selena Gomez is also in the movie. Although her character is a little aggravating and hard to like, she does fulfill her character arcs and grows from a broken and traumatized person, to a fixed and light-hearted person in the end. This goes for all the characters In the film as well. I also admire how this film is based on a novel, and has no narrator. Films like Ready Player One and The Kissing Booth, have unnecessary narration. The Fundamentals of Caring does not have this though, which makes it more subtle and easier to love. This film is definitely worth the watch and I'm giving it a 7/10."
" A feel good movie!
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,8,"Scrolling through some of the Netflix Originals you begin to wonder why on earth some of them are actually made! But this one caught my eye because I liked the cast and the trailer made you feel a sort of joy, I didn't expect to love this film as much as I did! 
I am a very emotional person and would cry at anything so if you are like me you might shed some happy tears. Paul Rudd puts on a fantastic performance as well as the rest of the cast, I think having such a small cast made it all that more heart warming and kept your focus on the plot.
Would recommend this to anyone who wants to sit and watch a good movie with a feel good story!"
" A pale imitation of other glories
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,2,Lots of talent (bar the ludicrous Selena Gomez in a career-killing performance) but absolutely no inspiration. A clueless drama that trots out every awful clich√© imaginable and is utterly predictable at every dreadful turn.
" Hilarious and heartwarming and never leans to heavily to either side.
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,10,"Ben Benjamin (Paul Rudd) plays a caretaker of Trevor (Craig Roberts) a teenager with Duschene Muscular Dystrophy (he can't move anything besides his hands and head) as they go on a road trip to see the world's largest pit, despite single mother Elsa's (Jennifer Ehle) warnings, picking up a quirky cast of characters including a rebellious girl who ran away from home named Dot (Selena Gomez) and Peaches (Megan Ferguson), a pregnant woman who's car broke down. The brilliantly comedic and dramatic banter between Rudd and Roberts is amazing and the supporting cast does a great job especially, and surprisingly, Selena Gomez. It's probably the best buddy road trip comedy since Dumb and Dumber though not as stupid and more realistic. 9.5/10 watch it on Netflix now."
" Very good indeed
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,10,"Stumbled across this title on Netflix after watching the series ""Atypical"". I don't normally take the time to write reviews but this is a great movie with some real heartwarming moments intertwined with moments of great sadness and genuine comedy. I find Paul Rudd either very good or terrible in his acting but in this he was a joy to watch. Some great supporting acting. You will not be disappointed if you watch this movie."
" The best Netflix original movie to date
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,9,"There are very few movies I feel as if I could watch repeatedly and actually enjoy every single time. This is one of them. It never fails to make me laugh out loud multiple times, and to feel as if I've experienced something special when the credits roll. The cast is simple but expertly and brilliantly but together. The chemistry between them is lovely, and the story they paint is something everyone deserves to see. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
" Proof Paul Rudd Completes Every Movie
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,10,"Paul Rudd is easily the most successful comedy star in the last 10 years. His films prove not only that he's hilarious to watch, but that he handles serious issues with the utmost passion. The Fundemantals of Caring seemed to fly under the Netflix radar for awhile, but is a must watch. There's not a disappointing scene in the entire movie."
" Average drama-comedy
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,3,"Paul Rudd is Ben, a depressed ex-writer with a tragic secret who decides to start a new career as a caregiver. His first job is with obnoxious Trevor, a British boy suffering from muscular dystrophy. What follows is a ""meet cute""/""take no prisoners"" kind of relationship, so popular in contemporary ""family movies"".Trevor is not a likeable guy, although suffering from a terrible and incurable illness, I found it impossible to sympathise with him. Ben is supposed ""not to get emotionally involved"" with Trevor, which looks like not requiring too much of an effort... but of course, he does get all fatherly.A Ben/Trevor road trip ensues peppered by several sub-plots, one of them about Dot, a foul-mouthed runaway who thinks she's the wisest girl on earth and - again, obviously - has a fling with Trevor.With the entrance of Dot I lost interest. She is - as described in ""Gone Girl"" - a ""cool"" girl, the type of stereotyped female that infests most contemporary movies. She is also a convenient plot device, ready to give Trevor his much needed sexual experience and to prove that ""cool"" girls have no prejudice - no matter how bad their language may be. A very ""indie' movie, from the look & feel to the straight to Netflix distribution"
" Healthcare professionals enjoy
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,10,"Me and my wife are both healthcare professionals taking care of all ends of the spectrum and this movie just makes us happy. In its own irregular way it takes someone with one of the least positive afflictions and makes them a triumphant story of the human spirit without being sappy crap. This movie crosses some boundaries that people are typically afraid to cross like, how can we call that person out if they're a mean person with a disease and shows us how to laugh with not at others. Tearing down walls of politically correctness, I love this movie"
" Second Chances!!
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,7,"What would you do if you get a second chance? This movie is basically about that. Not in the way you expect to compensate, but in a way that will make you feel good. Its a simple story of a disabled kid and a caregiver and expeditions along the way. Selena gomez was little predictable and pregnant woman was just there to extend the narrative. Movie is powered by very good performances but underplayed by two main leads, Paul rudd and the kid. There are no over the top melodramatic moments which is a savior. All in all a decent entertainer."
" An emotional roller coaster
",2018-07-17 00:00:00,10,This is a amazing movie. It's full of emotion of all sorts and this movie puts you in a good mood and leaves you balling your eyes out. I suggest watching this movie 110%.
" My heart feels so warm.
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,10,"I am full of pure love and believe that there is food in this world and all is well. Paul Rudd is such a good guy, makes you feel so welcomed into his cinematic performance, as if you're his buddy. Great movie, great feels."
" Hilarious and Heartfelt
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,8,"Movies like this do not come along every day. A movie that can send you through a myriad of emotions and make you think about the world while at the same time make you laugh your head off. I have never seen tragedy and humor blended together so well. I am a huge Paul Rudd fan and I really feel that this is his best role so far. Many people know him as a comedian but his serious acting is also amazing. You will see a blend of both in this movie. The chemistry between Ben, Trevor and Dot was amazing, I loved every second of it and I didn't want it to end. The addition of Peaches, the pregnant woman was a little confusing to me and I questioned her relevance until the scene where she is giving birth and we finally see the full flashback of the tragedy that befell Ben's son. We simultaneously see his son's life coming to an end while this new life is beginning. I felt that the movie lost its momentum once Peaches arrived and when they confronted Trevor's father. The actor they chose for him was an odd choice, was he supposed to appear mentally challenged or was he just a jerk? And Trevor's mom did not appear to be the coddling type, I thought it was strange that she would have written him those letters.I was sorry to see Dot go off with her father but I was glad that Trevor got to experience a normal life and romance, however brief it was. I like to decide that he sees her again and that they perhaps ultimately end up together somehow. I did not really like that Ben resigned as his caregiver two weeks after their epic ordeal, but I guess what Trevor said about Ben trying to find redemption through him was true. I guess the point is that they stay in each other's lives. It is beautiful that he lost his son and essentially gains Trevor to replace that connection. I did not like that Ben told Peaches that having children is literally the only reason we are all here. I do not feel that is true and I feel that the movie even realizes that in the end. The point of us all being here is clearly human connection, not just between parents and children, connections of love and understanding between ANYONE. I would have personally liked to have seen more backstory between Ben and his seemingly heartless wife after the accident and more clarity on the accident itself. Ben seemed to blame himself for what happened but it seemed to be a freak accident. Was it really his fault, or was something wrong with that car? It looked like the gear shift was shaky and that he had put the emergency brake on too. So I don't really understand how that ended up happening.It was beautiful how all of them had suffered in some way on their own and how together they filled in ""the deepest pit"" that was in each of their hearts. I think the point was to show how beautiful life can still be even amidst all the unexpected sorrow."
" A great mix of fun and drama
",2018-05-10 00:00:00,8,"This film has Paul Rudd in the lead so I was interested in watching it, and I have now seen The Fundamentals of Caring and I actually really enjoyed watching this film. The premise of the film sees a man after suffering a personal tragedy becomes a carer for a disabled teenager and try and find himself again. As mentioned Paul Rudd is the lead in this film and he is fantastic in the role. he brings the humour to the role that you would expect but I was particularly impressed with his dramatic work in this film. In the last few years he has improved immensely as an actor and this film is one of his best overall performances. Craig Roberts plays Trevor the teenager Rudd is caring for and he is great in this film, the chemistry and relationship between him and Rudd really drives this film forward and is easily the best part of this film. Selena Gomez is in this film as sort of a romance for Trevor and she does a decent job in this film with a fun attitude bought to this film. However, there are a few characters in this film that were completely unnecessary and just poorly acted that took me out of the film. The story as mentioned before is at its strongest when it focuses on the relationship between Rudd and Roberts and it really develops really well and it is really well handled. Though as mentioned before this film has some elements in it that feels forced and unnecessary to detract from the overall quality of the film. The script is really good, the humour is obviously pretty funny having me laughing quite a lot of times. The drama though was also really well handled and saw me buying into the majority of the dramatic moments in the film. The style of the film could have been mishandled very easily but it is very well done, the mix of humour and drama really works and the pacing makes this film an easy watch. Overall this is a great journey to watch that will have you entertained for the majority and is definitely worth watching."
" Very well done
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,8,We just watched this on Netflix. It was so well done. We laughed and cried. The acting is superb. Watch this one!
" This movie gets to you. Great balance between humor and drama.
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,8,Paul Rudd plays for him a common role as the unsuccessful person who grows in to new circumstances in his life. He has done it great before in his comic movies and does it in this one as well. This is a heartwarming story about a boy with a disability who uses his sarcastic humor to deal with his situation. Paul Rudd becomes his caretaker with no goal to take it seriously. A special friendship bounds them together circling their special sarcasm and saves them both from the tragic in their lives. It grasps your interest from the start and continues to build it up trough the whole movie. Warmly recommended!
" Actual caring is better
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,5,"A writer (Paul Rudd) retires after a great personal tragedy and becomes a disabled teen's (Craig Roberts) caregiver. When the two embark on an road trip, both of their abilities to cope with the real world is put under a test. Also appearing: Julia Denton, Jennifer Ehle, Selena Gomez et al. There's something enduringly endearing about Paul Rudd. He's only an OK actor, and he does way too many bland and generic comedies¬Ö but I still find him cool and want to see most everything he shows up in. This is actually one the better ones. It's not really good, per se... but at least one of the less bland and generic ones. Based on a novel by Jonathan Evison, written and directed by Rob Burnett, produced as a Netflix original, it's a bittersweet comedy about not being a pussy and trying to live every once in a while. It has a heart in right place but looking back, I'd like to criticize more than applaud the result. Writer-director Burnett has tried definitely too hard creating an authentic and hip story to really get away with it. it would probably help if two of the three main female characters were more realistic or at least more compatible with the general tone, not as exaggerated and shallow as they are now. Also, Burnett seems to be much better at adding the story lines than working with them, so most of the stuff brought in gets carelessly thrown overboard at some point without proper development or closure. Well, at least the central story of taking a road trip gets enough attention. Rudd is charming as usual, but he doesn't quite have all the range needed for playing this character. He's fine most of the time because he speaks little and acting grumpy is easy, but all in all, it's easy to notice a certain lack of depth to his acting. Wish they used somebody more diverse actor for that role. The best thing here is Craig Roberts giving a quirky, deadpan performane as foul-mouthed disabled teen. Roberts is probably still best known for his breakthrough role in 2010's ¬ÑSubmarine"", but this is certainly a good follow-up. I kind of felt him channeling young Edward Norton and young Joseph Gordon- Levitt, which is a good company to hang out in. ""Fundamentals"" is quite OK but it doesn't really hold together well, if you begin to think about it. But... there's still Rudd!"
" Fun movie
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,8,We were not sure what to expect when we started watching. We mostly enjoyed the human side. What we did not like was the fact that the movie was not shot in any of the states they were supposed to be in. Also a TPMS light on the dash can not be turned off by replacing a fuse. Repairing a flat tire or airing up a tire is the only way to turn off the light.
" A heart-warming comedy.
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,9,"I picked this movie mostly at random on Netflix and was very pleasantly surprised to see a sweet comedy like this one. It was vulgar, cringe- worthy, and provoked more than a few eyerolls. However overall, it was a very funny movie that made the journey worthwhile.Paul Rudd was clearly the driving force behind the drama, but both Craig Roberts and Selena Gomez (?!) did a fine job as the love-struck couple travelling through the American West. It didn't transcend its medium, but it was a very earnest film that made me laugh and (almost, but not really) cry.(I saw this on March 1, 2017.)"
" Subtly Acted and Heartwarming,
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,8,"The Fundamentals of Caring is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It deals with a lot of heavy issues, but manages to handle it in a way that is very tame and is never too much for its audience, such as disabilities and the main character having lost his child. It balances out comedy and drama incredibly well, it has moments that had me snickering, as well as moments that brought a tear to my eye, and I never felt like either was overbearing. I was not, however, very fond of Dot and her contribution to the plot i have absolutely no problem with Selena Gomez' performance, I just did not care for the character, she felt like an unnecessary love interest in a movie that really would have been more powerful without one. I preferred the portion of the road trip that was just Ben and Trevor, and probably would have given it a nine, rather than an eight, had it remained that way. The highlight of the movie had to be the undeniable chemistry between Paul Rudd and Craig Roberts, their characters relationship is a pleasure to watch and see develop. It is sweet and pure, some of the best acting I have ever seen from Rudd, certainly the most subtle and realistic, while Roberts has terrific characterisation in his part, as well as some stellar comedic dialogue that he delivers immensely well. It is a heartwarming 90 minutes that brought a smile to my face. Dramatic, but never too much to handle, and very funny, The Fundamentals of Caring is worth the watch for anyone looking for a good comedy drama. A carer is put up to the tasked of taking after a boy with a special illness. When he finds out how long it has been since he has been out of the house, he decides to take him on a road trip. Best Performance: Paul Rudd"
" good film with original characters
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,7,"funny and quirkyFlawed but essentially good characters (i like those positive films, they always seem more true to life)Not the sort of film which you think ""wow what an amazing film!"" and rave on about to all your friends, which is why i didn't give it higher, but as far as feel good happy films it hit the right spots."
" If the movie Untouchable (2011) had been awful, it would have been this movie
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"This movie starts off with our special-needs-bad-attitude kid asking the question ""how would you wipe my ***."" And it ends me saying ""well, I would take this movie's cover picture, wipe your *** with it and then put it in your mouth. So my question to you is, 'did the sh*t ever leave the ***hole?'"" The philosophical / life questions this movie raises are all sh*t. I don't mean this as an insult. I mean literally every time the characters say something ""smart"" it is always somehow tied to sh*t, *** or ***holes. Few times to pen**. It goes down your throat in such extend that at some point you start to wish you were watching South Park episode about ""The Poo That Took a Pee"" just to how less genital / urea related content in your TV. I already early on, after the first ***-related comparison - decided I would not like this movie. As the story advanced, I only came to once again realize that movies can -indeed- be judged in the first minutes. The story felt like a try- hard version of Untouchable without delivering anything except bitterness and bad attitude. More suitable name for this title is The Fukk-a-mentality of Swearing, just because they swear and talk sh*t so much that you find yourself doing the same. I have been temporarily corrupted by this.... sh*t. All in all I can't recommend this movie to anyone else except to those who think swearing is cool or have illogical obsession about ***holes. I mean, who needs thought-provoking, witty or sarcasm when you can just use the worlds ***, f*** and sh*t in so many different orders that it would surprise you. Insert few pen**es so the jokes won't fall SHORT. Nope, still not funny.** I had to censor down a lot of the words because IMDb won't allow me to use the same swear words this movie is filled with. How sad is that. **"
" The perfect balance of drama and comedy
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,8,"The Fundementals of Caring is a hilarious and heart warming film that shows insight into the fact that you cannot provide proper care for some one with out in turn loving them, as well as the idea that the best way to help yourself is through helping others. I truly enjoyed the mystery of what happened to his son carried through out the film, leaving us to feel the whole gravity of his death hangover is while another child was being born. The parallels of life and death making the moment all the more intense. Altogether this films delicate balance of comedy and drama kept you on your toes, you'd be rolling on the floor one minute and on the brink of tears and just before you'd start to cry you'd be laughing again."
" Selena actually funny
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,6,"Ben Benjamin (Paul Rudd) is withdrawn and struggling after a tragedy. He is avoiding his wife Janet who is desperate for him to sign their divorce papers. Elsa (Jennifer Ehle) hires him to care for her bitter, rude, sarcastic son Trevor (Craig Roberts) who has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Ben and Trevor go on a roadtrip to see American roadside attractions and Trevor's absent father. Along the way, they pick up foul-mouthed hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez) and pregnant Peaches.Paul Rudd is playing sad in this one. He still retains some irreverent aspects but his sad core suppresses the humor in the early going. Selena Gomez turns out to be the funniest one in the bunch. It has a group of broken characters played by appealing actors. It's aiming for quirky depressed heart-warming and it's mostly fine."
" Not funny, not caring, not worth watching
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,2,"Where to start? The stars are for Craig who did his best with poor material, but not sure what a Welsh lad was playing at with an accent that seemed all over the place. Mother - accent and attitude grated from the first line she spoke - why not get an English actor or just let her be American by changing the plot a little, doubt it would have made any difference. I gave up 22 minutes before the end, when the second ""road trip"" character made an awkward appearance and the dialogue between her and Rudd was so stiff and unconvincing I just couldn't bear to continue watching. The ""caring"" by Rudd was totally unprofessional, and downright abusive at times, always deciding what Trev was going to do, never seemed caring. Manhandling a patient in this day and age?? Apparently it's supposed to be a comedy - had a little chuckle at the cheesy start in the classroom with the acronym. From then on all downhill, NOT funny just dropping in a naughty word now and again and joking about ass wiping. I think they missed an opportunity to have a fart scene with cigar-smoking Selena letting rip... (oh how hilarious, what a character that girl is) Maybe they did, after I switched off... I expect the pregnant woman didn't get through the whole journey with baby inside. I don't care what happened with Trev's dad. Waste of time."
" Good script, but not a good movie
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,7,"From the beginning of the movie I got confused thinking weather this is a good movie or not, because I founded that the script is really good but the directing wasn't, compared to the script, it was creative, entertaining and sarcastic.I didn't watch the trailer or read anything about the movie before I watched it, therefore I didn't know that it was based on a novel, and that's the reason of the fact that the script is well written.A thing that I didn't enjoy in the movie was the soundtrack, it was nice music but it didn't fit the scenes, although the songs were written for especially for the movie."
" wonderful offering from netflix
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,8,"i have never felt the need to review a movie on IMDb up until now, but it would be a shame if others miss out on this gem. /guy* evidently my review is too short for IMDb. it might be awhile before i review another one with that sort of inane requirement. there is a great quote, wait, i need filler so i'll go get it ......... ""My Letters were not wont to come so close one in the neck of another, nor yet to be so large. The short time I have had hath been the cause of both. I had not made this longer than the rest, but that I had not the leisure to make it shorter then it is."" ~Blaise Pascal.is that enough for you IMDb? take the hint--it's harder to write a short review that's good than a meandering longer one. /guy* geeeesh! now IMDb is telling me i didn't spell netflix right. i'm pretty sure that the characters are all in the right places and they just have some moronic requirements for capital letters.this will definitely be my first and last IMDb review. you guys can soldier on without my opinions, i'm sure. /guy"
" A heartwarming and awkward road trip of a movie.
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,9,"Big Network TV producer Rob Burnett directs his first feature length film since 2007's comedy, We Made This Movie. The bulk of his entertainment career has been as executive producer behind The Late Show with David Letterman and CEO of network televisions programs such as Everyone Loves Raymond and The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn. Based on Jonathan Evison's book, The Revised Fundamentals of care giving. Burnett Netflix original about a Teenager boy, Trevor, who suffers from Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy embarks on a road trip of discovery with his new, inexperienced carer Ben Benjamin who appears to have his own underlying, personal issues himself. Trevor is played by Craig Roberts and I'm finding it hard to judge his acting, because I have little experience of knowing people who suffer with that disease and I don't want to offend anyone by saying it he was amazing. I can, however, comment on his character, who is sarcastic to the highest degree, pessimistic yet humorous will it and quite the challenging person to care for. Paul Rudd is an absolute treat to watch as the struggling carer Ben Benjamin who's lack of experience doesn't match his perseverance of getting the job done. The chemistry between the two is touching and balanced, especially when Benjamin manages to convince Trevor's overprotective mother to allow them to take a road trip and strike off a lot of places off of Trevor's bucket list leading onto quite the adventure. It's a joy to watch their relationship grow and having a few other characters jumping on the band wagon along the way, such as Selena Gomez who plays a rather foul-mouthed free spirit young lady who's not afraid to voice her opinions. It's brutally honest which is refreshing and highly entertaining as egos and morals clash in the van. Impressively shot in only 26 days, it actually feels a lot longer than the 97minute running which is actually a good thing. It's doesn't drag at all as there's plenty going on. It's an often humorous, yet touching and thought-provoking story where all the characters get an education in life, changing their perspectives. It's a heartwarming, joyful journey with it's expected bumps along the way but coming to a lovely conclusion, certainly one of Netflix's must sees. Running Time: 9 The Cast: 8 Performance: 9 Direction: 8 Story: 9 Script: 9 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for such a refreshing and slightly awkward road trip Blu-ray: Yes, would go next to films like 50/50 and Edge of Seventeen. 85% 9/10"
" Underwhelming and Predictable
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,1,"This review contains spoilers...but there is literally nothing interesting that could possibly be spoiled. If this was the first movie I ever watched, maybe I might have enjoyed it. However, seeing as every plot element was pretty much cut and pasted from every sentimental drama ever, it was just painful to watch. I wanted to cry at the funny scenes and laugh at the sad scenes. I have no idea why Paul Rudd agreed to a role he obviously didn't have any feelings for. There was little to no character development. He started out sad and boring and ended up less sad, but still boring. Craig is my favorite character, but that's not saying much. His acting was actually pretty decent, considering the terrible dialogue he had to work with. Of course, the second you see Selena Gomez, you already know they're going to have a fun, uncomplicated fling, because c'mon, he's dying! He deserves to have a hot, spunky, no-nonsense girl! And of course, instead of trying for interesting, humorous dialogue, she just swears a lot. How funny. But here's where I give it one star instead of two: After already being bored to tears with the most predictable movie I've ever seen, they introduce a pregnant character whose only contribution to the whole movie is to give birth at an unexpected location, just so Paul Rudd gets to be the hero and help her and have some sort of nearly-emotional moment.Pathetic, lazy writing."
" You can't help cracking a smile and having fun.
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"The Fault In Our Stars and The Trip come together in a hot, steamy mess to produce this simple movie, full of simple pleasures. Once again, Paul Rudd combines heart and feeling with humour as effortlessly and brilliantly as waffles and a sausage. Without doubt, the best part of the movie (much like Rudd and Segel's 'I Love You Man') is the well crafted bickering and banter between the two main characters, Ben and Trevor; Rudd and Roberts make you feel as if you are back hanging out with your best mate after school again. Gomez is (surprisingly) strong in support, delivering a great balance of sass and humour for the others to bounce off.Yes, like many American buddy-style film, there a are a few corny bits in there, but, if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favour! Treat yourself to a bloody good laugh, and revel, once again, in the ease of Rudd's humour and evident improvisation - ""Bite of the James, shall we?"". 'The Fundamentals of Caring' left me vacantly appreciating the credits with my head, filled ear to ear with a smile, nodding in content and appreciation (you know the one!), and I'm sure it will do the same for you."
