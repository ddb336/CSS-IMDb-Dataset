" Horribly disappointing!
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,1,"This was an awful movie! I was so excited because of the cast, but the casting and acting was all wrong. I love LaPaglia, but he was not the right choice for this character. There were so many plot holes and choppy scene cuts, I literally thought I was missing parts of the movie. The script and acting were just plain bad. The subtle nods to other Stephen King works as well as The Dead Zone were nice, but they could have done so much more with this, as the story itself was pretty interesting."
" Nasty but good
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,7,"Soon after their 25th wedding anniversary, Darcy discovers something which leads her to believe that her husband Bob may be a serial killer. But, if she is right, who would believe that she never knew?This is a fairly accurate retelling of a novella from Stephen King's collection Full Dark, No stars. The four stories in this book were among King's very darkest, and A Good Marriage is probably the least dark.Joan Allen is a perfect Darcy - appalled, unbelieving, struggling to find a way to deal with the discovery and its ramifications. Anthony Lapaglia is Bob , not the easiest of roles given the conflicting nuances he is required to convey. He too is good in what is essentially a two-hander."
" Awful. Just awful
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,2,"The acting is dreadful, script is ridiculously slow moving and no real character development. Terrible acting all around."
" Not my definition of
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,7,"Then again, this is from the mind of Stephen King, so what do I know, right? That's a good question actually. Let's establish that while I know it is based on a short story by King, I have not read said short story. So can't compare or rate based on that.That aside, the movie is quite good. Not just the actors (really well chosen), but how it was made. To get inside the mind of someone is not an easy thing - to visualize that and to keep the viewer interested. Because not all that is seen, actually is real. Well duh, I know this is a movie, so actually and literally nothing of what you see is true. But you know what I mean or rather will when you watch this. Well made and tension filled ... even if I have issues with characters and choices ... but that is just the way it is"
" Fabulous
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,8,I've seen a lot of negativity about this piece and I picked it up on Amazon by a fluke over the weekend. I absolutely adored it. Yes it is not really like Stephen King to write something of this nature. But it was a very good tale of how this would probably go down. Intriguing and I absolutely adore the ending. Touche
" Too slow and boring but worth it after an hour
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,7,"It's too slow and but worth it after an hour.
The acting is barely good.
It is worth it after an hour.
Watch it on Netflix/Amazon Prime Video."
" Predictable, boring, unoriginal
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,3,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in the past few years. Poor suspense, unoriginal twists, silly scenes (especially with the old sick detective). This movie was confused, bland and had no real direction.In reality there's may be as many awful movies based on Stephen King writings as there are great ones."
" Pointless movie
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,1,Waste of time the ending is disappointing could of been better ðŸ˜ž
" A little understated but very good
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,10,"I have watched most of King's movie adaptations. I am honestly often disappointed in them, compared to the novels. I had not read this novella, so I am reviewing without that comparative aspect.
I found it a bit understated for King, but that was actually refreshing and unexpected. Without the distraction of the gore, it was a skillful character study and the pacing I thought was just right. I would highly recommend A Good Marriage, unless someone is such a rigid King fan that they can't value a little different treatment of such material."
" not a good movie
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,1,"This is my first ever review on a movie. the movie start on a good note but then there is NOTHING in the movie . very dull very boring . nothing is happening and no action from the serial killer who is the main character of the movie.
nothing really in the end. disappointed . they miss a big hit."
" An interesting idea becomes a rather cliched domestic thriller
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,4,"A couple have enjoyed a close and loving marriage for 25 years and celebrate their anniversary with their family. While the husband (Anthony La Paglia) is away on business, Darcy (Joan Allen) begins to suspect and discovers that her husband is a notorious serial killer. As well as keeping up the pretence, she is unsure of her next move.Scripted by Stephen King from his own short story, an interesting idea gives way to some rather hackneyed execution with some typical over the top cat and mouse violence so typical of the genre."
" Promising start, then it flatlines
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,5,"Darcy Anderson has it all - her husband Bob is an accountant, they in live in a nice house, their kids are successful and she has maintained her great figure. One night when Bob is away on a business trip she makes a shocking discovery in the garage - it looks like he is a sadistic serial killer known as BD. Does she do the right thing and call the cops? NO. Instead she stays home alone, but has Bob returned early or is her imagination playing horrifying tricks on her?
As my header reads I thought this one started off quite well, I got into the characters and then the discovery, it was very well done. The remainder of the film however, save for the odd moment, does descend into what looks like a typical made for TV movie. Joan Allen does a great job playing Darcy, she was the best thing on offer here and a looks stunning for a 58 year old (at the time of release). A Good Marriage is a dark and suspenseful thriller, borderline horror but those reviews suggesting that it is one of the best Stephen King adaptations are laughable. I watched it for free on TV and it proved a satisfactory watch, however I would not pay to see it."
" If you're after a gory horror type Stephen King film, this is not for you, but if you're after a film which really gets you to think, this is Stephen King doing what he does!
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,7,"There are a lot of reviews here which compare this film with the likes of Christine and Carrie, but, despite being from the same author, this is a different genre of film and cannot really be compared to these out and out horrors. A Good Marriage is far more subtle, realistic and, because of this, kind of unnerving.We follow the story from Darcy's POV, as she discovers her husband's secret ""hobby"" and then has to decide what to do about it. It may seem like a no brainer to a casual observer, but Darcy realises that she needs to consider the effect her actions would on her children. Occassionally she sees the possible outcomes and so the viewer can better understand why she chooses to do what she does whilst also adding a hint of fantasy which makes you begin to question exactly what is real and what is in Darcy's mind; a feeling which is surely shared with the protagonist. Her decisions throughout are entirely believable and it does make you question, what would you do in her place. Do you know what your other half is capable of? What would you be capable of if you were in her place?By no means is this the best Stephen King movie you'll ever see, but it certainly shouldn't be underrated simply due to the fact that it is not the kind of film that we immediately associate with that name.Overall a good little film to get the grey matter working."
" Not bad at all but ....
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,6,"This little movie is not unusual at all, but suffers from too lengths, it is sometimes boring and you may wish to use the fast forward button. The overall story is interesting though. With a good ending. I did not read the Stephen King's novel, so I can't compare nor analyse the adaptation."
" Very entertaining thriller by the master!!
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,9,"Not his best but still another great story by the master STORYTELLER!! Hes not a horror writer, hes not a writer you can pigeon hole into. He is by far the BEST storyteller of all time!!! This is another example of his brilliant stories that always has a great ending!!.....happy or not!!"
" Not a Typical Thriller
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,7,"A modest Stephen King adaptation. Seems almost like some Lifetime movie about the BTK Killer, but with better actors. It never really fulfills the viewer, it's not a typical thriller, but it is worth watching. Maybe a few twists you aren't expecting. Joan Allen carries this thing on her back, she's great, as always."
" More a drama than a thriller or horror flick
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,6,"This is a good story but the way it plays out is weak. It's mostly a family drama with an underlying thread involving a dark and diabolical secret. There's a perfect suburban family. The horrible secret is revealed. Things are seemingly accepted and, for the most part, we all go back to our coin collections and white picket fences. What should have been the big surprise of the film really wasn't. It was enjoyable, but would have been more so had the story focused more on the evil side of things."
" Long and Slow
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,1,A Drama that is slow and confusing. Was waiting for a plot twist that never came.
" Entertaining in many ways!
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,8,"This movie has suspense, creepiness, dark comedy, and a good story. Well worth watching."
" Kinda weak.......
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,3,"If you never watched this movie, you wouldn't miss much. The storyline was very tepid. No build up at all, just jumping from scene to scene, and you just have to accept what happens. No character build-up, so you never get invested in anyone. The biggest lapse was the missing fear and anticipation you typically expect from a Stephen King style story. You keep waiting for the twist that never comes. I gave it three stars because the main actors did act well with the shallow script given to them. In summary, I'd say move on to the next one."
" REDICULOUS UNREAL...GARBAGE MOVIE!
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,2,"STEPHEN KING LOST HIS MIND ON THIS ONE. GARBAGE. DO NOT WATCH! This movie makes woman and wives out to be sorry losers, ashamed of themselves and scared to to do what they should do. IT'S A VERY DIS HONORABLE MOVIE. In the beginning when the wife finds her husband's ""serial killer"" evidence, she acts all crazy scared.... NO.... any normal person would have called the police immediately! Ok...its a movie, we have to play along.....God bless this woman for playing along with her serial killer husband. ....who finds out that she knows....OMFG!!!! How do you live in that household! Crazy scary! Very well acted out,
throughout the movie. The ending is priceless. ...watch to see! No secrets given here. It's an ok 3 star movie to watch."
" Interesting Moral Dilemma of Not Truly Knowing Someone
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,7,"This was a film that I picked up on DVD a couple years after it came out as I remember reading the short story from King and really liking it. The first time I've watched it though was on Prime when my girlfriend Jaime as she thought it sounded good and I never pass up a chance to see a movie she's interested in. The synopsis here is after 25 years of a good marriage, what will Darcy (Joan Allen) do once she discovers her husband's sinister secret?We start this movie at a party where Bob Anderson (Anthony LaPaglia) is given an award. He does taxes and he's one of the best that works for Bill Gaines (Mike O'Malley). Also at this party is his wife Darcy, their daughter Petra (Kristen Connolly), her fiancÃ© Vince Dorne (Will Rogers) and their son Donnie (Theo Stockman). Betty Pike (Cara Buono) who is best friends with Darcy is also in attendance. She's pretty drunk and is upset about a serial killer that is stalking the New England area.The married couple goes home to celebrate some more. We get to see what feels like a routine for the two when they make love. Bob does have a bit of a wandering eye as he sees Betty from his window kissing someone in her garage. He's called back by his wife and as they get intimate.They seem like a normal happy family, but there's a man who much later we learn is named Holt Ramsey (Stephen Lang). He was at the party in the beginning, watching them and is also been staking out the house.Bob is into collecting rare antique coins and does a lot of traveling to try to find more as well as for work. Darcy is watching television and a graphic horror movie is on. She's freaked out, but the remote won't work. She goes out to the garage to try to find a new battery. She knocks over a magazine to find some she's been looking for. She also discovers that her husband has a fetish she didn't know about. There's something much more sinister hiding behind the boxes. There's a nook with a little box that contains an ID of the recently found murdered woman along with a couple other cards with her name on it.Is her husband is this notorious serial killer named Beadie. Darcy has to decide what she will do next. He calls her and notices that she's been crying. There's not a lot of time and a lot has to be considered and makes you think, what would you do if you were in her position?I knew coming in that I had read this King short story as I believe at the time of writing this is the last book of his shorts that has come out. This one intrigued me that King based this off of the BTK Killer, who also lived a double life where his family and church had no idea what he was doing. Now that one plays out differently than the real life story. What I like is the moral dilemma this poses which that sparked conversation between Jaime and I afterwards. I don't recall the story playing out like the film does as from what I remember, it ends pretty soon after Darcy finds the secret. I could be wrong there though.Now I really want to delve into what you'd do if you discovered your significant other is a murderer. There's the moral obligation to turn them in, because if you don't, they could continue to kill and that would be on you as an accomplice. On the other side, like in the case here, Darcy and Bob have been married for 25 years. They have two successful children that have lives of their own. This could set a domino of effects that could ruin them, even though they had nothing to do with it. When I asked Jaime, she straight away said she'd turn me in. I played devil's advocate, but I probably would to.There's another layer to this in that Bob has gotten away with what's he has been doing for so long that he has to be a master manipulator. The lines that he feeds to his wife, make her wonder if she can trust him to do what he promises he will. There's also that fear in the back of her mind that you can't fully trust them after the betrayal of being kept in the dark for so long.Shifting this over to the pacing, it runs 102 minutes long. I never got bored with it, so I didn't really have any issues there. I do think that there probably was a bit that could have been cut from it to get it down to 90 minutes to be honest. I'm going by the old adage here that the first 90 are free and you need to convince me for anything over that. There's a bit of filler in my eyes to trim from it. I do like where it ends up and how this ordeal changes Darcy.Speaking of which, the acting of this movie I thought was good. This is really a vehicle for Allen as our lead with LaPaglia there as a secondary, but important driver to the story. Allen's performance as Darcy was good. I feel horrible for her with what she discovers and coming to terms with what she has to do in order to survive. She also has to keep in mind her children as she's a really good mother. I do see shade of my mother in her to be honest. LaPaglia I thought was good as well. He establishes the norm for his character and then we get to see the darkside of it. That works very well for me. Lang, Buono, Connolly and the rest of the cast do round this out for what was needed as well in shaping these two stars.That will take me to the effects of the movie which there really aren't a lot actually. The only time I can think is at the climax of the movie where Darcy comes to terms with what she has to do. There are pictures of the victims from Beadie, which they did a really good job with making them look realistic. We do get Darcy having to deal with things in her mind that we see play out. That did work for me and I'd say that the cinematography was solid as well.Now with that said, this is a movie that poses an interesting question of what you'd do in this person's position. It also shows us something that really did happen and that we truly don't know someone like we think we do. The movie does run a bit long, but not enough to ruin what we got or get boring. I thought he acting was good. We don't get a lot in the way of effects, but we also don't necessarily need them. The soundtrack didn't really stand out to me and it also didn't hurt the movie either. They do use a lot of older songs that fit more to our main characters when they younger. Overall though I'd say this is an above average movie in my opinion. I'd recommend this for horror and non-horror fans alike as well."
" Worst movie I've seen
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,1,"And that's saying something. Seriously, I waited 1.5 hours for the plot to get going and then it was over. Story line was weak, no real drama or suspense, random wedding that really had nothing to do with the story. Just a complete waste of time."
" Horrible
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,3,"This was a complete of time. I kept waiting for a big twist or SOMETING interesting to happen, but nope."
" a story of betrayed love and trust
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,7,"To begin with the good, ""A Good Marriage"" is a suspenseful and ingenious thriller/horror story, about a middle-aged woman who discovers that her much-beloved husband has been hiding secrets of exceptional vileness. As a result, she also discovers that much of her own existence - so placid, so blameless, so safe - has been built on a foundation of treacherously shifting sand. It's a demanding role but Joan Allen (Darcy Anderson) does very well here.On the minus side : I've never read the Stephen King story the movie is based on, but I'm willing to bet good money that it is a relatively short story rather than a full-grown book. I'm saying this because the movie, sometimes, feels stretched too thin. It could easily lose a quarter of an hour or even half an hour. Moreover, the movie descends in quality near the end, after our heroine has become the target of an old investigator pursuing some leads ; there's something about their relationship that does not ring true.Still, a commendable effort, and well worth a watch during a rainy afternoon."
" Did I Miss Something
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,5,"Everything from the beginning of the movie leads you in the direction that Bob is the bad guy nobody knew about for 25 years. When Darcy starts to imagine things happening that really don't happen, it's hard to tell if it was part of the story or her imagination. Left me thinking she was the one who killed all the women and not Bob but she blocks it out and believes the reality to be that he did and decides she must kill him before she is the next victim. It was just very odd how she seemed so afraid after ""discovering "" what he did yet decides to act like nothing ever happened as long as he promises not to do it again. Overall confusing, not convinced Bob was the serial killer like most other reviewers do."
" I didn't know King did Lifetime Movies
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,1,I thought I was watching LMN. Unconvincing switches. Brutal!!!!
" Horrible!
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,1,Went through a lot of trouble making an account for my first review. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE!
" Mask of Deception!
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"Holt Ramsey, played by Stephen Lang, who is holding Bob Anderson's coin in his hand says: ""It's blurred, like it's two pennies."" Darcy Anderson (Bob's wife) replies: ""Yeah, some people are that way too.""You never know what goes on behind closed doors or on spooky roads in the dark of night. I thought the movie was different but a bit subdued. Stephen King is a deranged genius in my opinion, and I mean that as a compliment. There was no blood or gore per se but this flick was more of a psychological thriller. I like most everything Stephen King has written, so I didn't want to pass this up.I thought the acting was great! Joan Allen and Anthony Paglia are stellar actors and are naturals. There was no pomp or circumstance--no whistles and bells. I think it was planned that way.Darcy's reaction to her husband's secret was riveting. Darcy felt trapped like a rat in her own home! But she was an intelligent woman--desperate and frightened, yes, but she was a rational woman and dealing with a man who wasn't playing with a full deck! Darcy played along with him though. Had I been the wife, I would have told Bob, look I'm visiting my sister. I'll be back in oh, say, two years and would have gathered all the evidence beforehand and reported  to the authorities. Bye, bye psycho hubby! But Darcy had other ideas in mind. No spoiler here!Joan Allen and Anthony LaPaglia are stellar actors and they handled their parts with professionalism and ingenuity. I give them a 10 star rating for that. However, I'm rating the movie an 8 because it was slow in some areas. Though I didn't read the book, I felt some key points were missing in the movie. I noticed, too, there wasn't a whole lot of music in the background to fill all the empty spaces in the movie but I got so engrossed in the story, I quickly got over it.Bob Anderson, LaPaglia's character, was the devil incarnate for sure, and he had me wondering what he was going to do next. Joan Allen's character, Darcy Anderson, appeared to be living in denial and I was worried about her outcome; but as fortune would have it, it turned out the way I hoped it would.The entire cast ensemble was great! Stephen Lang rocks! This was a good flick to pass the time away. The right cast was chosen for this movie. Bravo!"
" Underwhelmed!
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,4,Really not scary at all. Watched to the end but wished I had not wasted my time. Really feel blah about the whole film. I was expecting a twist at the end . That never happened and thats the only reason I watched the whole film. I'd hoped because it was based on a very realistic plot to be more frightened but it fell flat.
" Just dull
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,3,"This film commits the one unpardonable sin that no ""thriller"" should ever make. It's simply boring. There's no atmosphere, the characterization is ridiculous, the tension is weak, the performances are pedestrian, and the thrills, such as they are, are very few and far between.Stephen King should be much better than this."
" Entertaining
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,8,"This is an entertaining movie with a good cast. It held my interest and lived up to my expectations. I generally disregard the ratings when they're all over the place, as then I figure I have a fair chance. Sometimes I win and sometimes not. This time was good, and I did enjoy it right up to the end. Give it a try, you can always turn it off."
" A Good Marriage = A Bad Movie
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,3,"I loved the short story, but it did not translate to a quality movie. Stretching it out to movie length resulted in good actors acting out bad tropes. And then the same tropes got used over and over again. Do yourself a favor. Turn off the movie, and pick up ""Full Dark, No Stars"", the book that contains the far superior short story."
" Meh
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,5,I had high hopes for this that didn't pan out. It had potential but sputtered out
" HO HUM
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,2,"As I have gotten used to with Stephen King's later novels and adapted movies, this is pretty weak. After watching this, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. You keep thinking the twist is coming, but it doesn't. You think maybe everything that's happening is all in Darcy's mind, but it isn't. You think Stephen Lang's character may be a figment of someone's imagination, or some ominous bad guy, but he isn't. This movie just ""isn't""."
" It Just Kind of Was
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,6,"To me this movie just kind of existed. It wasn't terrible by any means but I kept waiting for some twist or shock (other than the obvious) and one never came. The acting was good, the dialogue was fine, but a lack of suspense is what kept me from giving this movie a higher rating. It's still worth a watch though."
" Another Steven King's stories on the big screen *5
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,7,As a fan of King's work : A Good Marriage brought to life was no disappointment. Characteractors Darcy & Bob Anderson played by: (Darcy) Joan Allen (Bob ) Anthony LaPaglia perfect for the roles.
" Don't bothrer
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,1,"Typical Stephen King pap: trite, hackneyed, shallow, weird contrived plot if there's a plot at all. Joan Allen deserves better. Boring, dragged-out story that makes no sense."
" Terrible casting ruined a great story
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,2,Anthony LaPagila delivers a boring drab forgettable performance as Bob Anderson.This could have been an absolute classic thriller if it wasn't for the poor casting.A waste of a good story!
" Stephen King delivered..
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,8,I have learned to not go by the reviews of naysayers solely. Weigh the reviews and you can usually tell within the first half hour which way it's going to go. That's what happened and this made for such a good movie. Plot twist was amazing and definitely a Stephen King plot. Enjoyed it. It's not average by a longshot.
" THE BLURRED PENNY
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,6,"Bob Anderson (Anthony LaPaglia) and his wife Darcy (Joan Allen) have an excellent life with great kids. Meanwhile there is a serial killer on the loose who calls himself ""Beadie."" He tortures, rapes, and kills women. The plots come together rather fast then you wonder where Steven King is going to go with this...and it is a bit anti-climatic considering his other efforts.The movie was way too short. After it had established the characters, it seems to have been on a downhill slide as it solves the mystery for us rather early. The film was like sex without foreplay. It went through the motions, but it could have been better.Thanks for the coin symbolism, but it needed more. It was as if Steven King didn't write the script, but just added his name to it for some coin.Parental Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity."
" Average (Highly)
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,5,"This is a typical 4 or 5 star movie as far as my taste goes. Pros.....
1. Good acting I feel. I liked the characters. Bob was definitely an odd duck. I picture a serial killer to act similiar to that of his character.
2. Cool story.
Cons....
1. Kind of anemic.
2. Flakey ending"
" Sleep inducing
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,2,"A GOOD MARRIAGE is another recent horror/thriller based on a story by Stephen King, and again it's one of the worst adaptations of his work. The story is drab and drawn out, dragging on forever, essentially a two-hander between Joan Allen's suspicious housewife and Anthony LaPaglia as her mysterious husband. What plays out is anything but interesting; a dragged out story of serial killing and cover-up, one that attempts to shock with twists and the like but is forever boring. Allen is unrecognisable underneath tons of plastic surgery that makes it hard to show any kind of expression whatsoever, and Stephen Lang is wasted in an underwritten supporting role. The only thing this extremely poor film induces is sleep."
" I don't understand why so many low reviews
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,8,"I read the story before I saw the movie and although there were some changes to the script that I thought were not improvements, I was still surprised to see the film was enjoyable and was a great psychological exploration of what a woman in that horrible dilemma might go through. The story is not about the horrors of serial killers or the supernatural horrors one might expect from King but its about the emotional horror of choosing to live with a secret of unimaginable bearing. I think that the reason many people think this is boring is because that idea went right over their heads. Watch the film amd read the story. Both are great!"
" Hands down the worst movie I've ever seen
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,1,"It may sound like an exaggeration to call it the worst movie for all time but this, for me, is it. There is nothing to like about this movie. The dialogue is just odd, nothing anybody says at any point sounds like something a real person would say, the acting is god-awful, Anthony LaPaglia's American accent is laughable at best, the plot is nonexistent and there are absolutely no twists or turns at any point. Don't waste your time, this is as bad as film making can possibly get"
" Even when played faster on VLC it still drags, this film has no redeeming features.
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,1,"Life is too short for bad films and this is particularly bad. I think older ladies might enjoy this film, probably more those who don't much like men, it feels like a TV movie and is easy to watch though incredibly boring. It is both unbelievable and quite unpredictable yet intensely dull at the same time. There are moments of tension which are overly long and repeated and always disappoint. At no time was I immersed, the acting is shallow and forgettable. The plot is such utter nonsense that it isn't even worth getting in to. Around halfway through this film I set VLC to play it at a speed of 1.4 just to get to the end, hoping for a while that it still might do something worthwhile - it didn't, it only gets worse, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Avoid."
" I loved it
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,9,"I watched this today and I was on the edge of my chair, I thought it was very good and I highly recommend this movie. I thought this was one of the best of Stephen Kings stories. It was suspenseful and I wonder what I would do if I was in Mrs. Anderson's shoes."
" Disappointing
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,4,"I haven't read Stephen King's novel of the same title which this movie is based on, but can only assume it's the primary material that is responsible for this movie being such a huge dull dud. It starts with a lot of promise and I was very engaged, watching this picture perfect couple with their 'good marriage' and wondering what was going to happen to shatter their world. Unfortunately, it just didn't really seem to go anywhere and I found myself questioning every single decision that was being made and wondering what logical person would react this way. Upon Darcy's discovery that her husband is in fact a serial killer, she reacts like anyone would in the same position - with confusion, shock, disbelief, reversion and panic. However, from that point onwards I couldn't understand any of the bizarre decisions Darcy made. Why would you stay in the house? Even if her husband was away, I'd be out of that house and as far away as I could get. When her husband asked if they could forget what had happened and move on (which is perhaps one of the most disturbing and shocking scenes, I've witnesses, and a strong point of the movie), why didn't she lull him into a false sense of security and when he was out of not paying attention leave and go straight to the police? Instead, she continued to play house with a man that was clearly psychotic and had violently raped and killed multiple women, and then randomly attacked him days (or maybe weeks later). I can't understand how or why she came to the decision that killing her husband was the best resolution and I can't imagine that any sane person would immediately jump to that conclusion. At first, I wondered if we were supposed to question Darcy's morality and that King was playing with us, and actually, she was the evil one, but as the movie progressed that clearly wasn't true. Darcy was painted as being an innocent victim of her husband's crimes that did what she did because she wanted to protect her children from being tarnished by her father's crimes. It's a poor excuse and does little to justify her actions, in my opinion. Of course finding out the truth about their father's crimes would harm them for a short while, but eventually the world would forget and they'd all be able to return to normal. Resorting to murder seems too extreme and I can't wrap my mind around that. Unfortunately, the fact that I can't understand or justify Darcy's actions, means the whole movie fell flat for me. It felt unrealistic and as though it was overreaching. Having said this, the strongest part of the movie was definitely Joan Allen's performance as Darcy, which I can't fault. She carried the movie and if it wasn't for her engaging performance, I probably wouldn't have managed to watch until the end.Other than that, I'm afraid this movie did fall flat for me. I was constantly waiting for something more to happen, for a reasonable explanation as to what was happening and why, but it was never delivered. We don't even get a proper explanation as to why her husband has killed people (except for his explanation of it being a friend inside his head that takes over) and there's little insight into Darcy's thought processes. When she suddenly attacks her husband I was shocked because it felt like it came out of nowhere. It also seemed uncharacteristically sinister and evil for a woman that was supposedly 'normal'. And the one final question that plagued me is how did the police not discover that her husband's death wasn't an accident? How would he have managed to fall over the banister the way he did? They'd tell just from his position and the way he landed that he was pushed, because it would be impossible to fall that way. Furthermore, they would surely be able to tell that the cause of death was suffocation which wouldn't make sense based on the injuries he received from that fall. Overall, this movie lacks logic or reasoning. I think it had the potential to be really good, but more thought needed to be put into it, and I'm not sure if the lack of consideration is due to the directors/producers or from the original material by King. Regardless, this is a sub-par movie that I certainly wouldn't recommend to friends."

" OK Thriller
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,6,A Good Marriage: Based on a Stephen King story with a screenplay by King. A thriller rather than Horror but not too many thrills so best to concentrate on the Serial Killer angle. Joan Allen is married to Anthony LaPaglia for 25 years and suddenly finds evidence which suggests that he's a Serial Killer and a really brutal one at that. He admits to it and they enter a pact where she will remain silent and he promises to quit his nefarious activities. After all their daughter is getting married the next week and the scandal would ruin the reception.Will he hold to his promise? Is Allen at risk? Who is the mysterious character keeping watch on their house? On Netflix. 6/10.
" Joan Allen?
",2017-12-09 00:00:00,4,"I had to check, this is the same Joan Allen as was in Bourne movies ? Goes to show: early beauty is no guarantee of later life attractiveness. Most of cast is uninspiring, movie plods like most formula movies, no one stands out as in the 'now' ClichÃ© lines and droll setting; don't waste more than 30mins, clicker is your salvation."
" **1/2
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,6,"Interesting drama with the flaw being that one reaches a point when you can't explain whether there is fantasy or reality going on.All seems well as a couple are celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary only for the wife to discover that her husband is the serial killer that has been terrorizing New England.The confusion comes in when we don't realize if she is imagining what he is doing to her, especially when she wakes up after a dream sequence. Eventually, Joan Allen, who is excellent in the part takes matters into her own hands and pushes her murderous husband down a flight of stairs and then proceeds to suffocate him when the fall didn't do him in.At the funeral, a detective shows up who is pursuing the case only to collapse and on his death bed, he tells Allen that she did the right thing by doing her evil husband in.The background music is eerie and quite appropriate for what we are viewing. Naturally, her discovery is made during a thunderstorm to keep the tension going."
" TV Movie
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,3,"This really comes across as a TV movie. There is nothing special about it. The styling is very much 'stepford wives' in that it portrays a perfect American family, a perfect marriage that others are envious of. No hair out of place, a couple who have been married 25 years yet still have sex, still love each other and take pride in how they look.That all comes to a screeching halt when Darcy stumbles across the fact that her husband is a serial killer.My thoughts are that this film is watchable but I wouldn't rate it as particularly good. It's passable at best."
" A Good Marriage? (Warning: Possible spoilers ahead)
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,7,"I'll start off by saying I'm a huge Stephen King fan - always have been; always will be. But I haven't rushed to see ""A Good Marriage"" because the reviews haven't been great. But it was the sheer ordinariness of this movie that sent chills up my spine. It made me think of Hannah Arendt's coverage of the Eichmann trials and musings on the banality of evil. Most of us aren't shocked when a criminal is rounded up who looks like Charles Manson and has a troubled past. But what do we make of the criminal who has no criminal past, looks like the classic ""boy/girl next door"", and was class valedictorian? The Ted Bundys of the world? Okay, so the beginning was a bit of a snooze fest. I kept thinking to myself, ""Normal, hard-working people, happy family, solid marriage - I get it already."" I honestly wasn't expecting a lot from this movie. I love Stephen King, but I had heard that A ""Good Marriage"" lacked the requisite Stephen King signature staples, like rotting, talking corpses, telepathic powers, killer cars, etc. And though the main theme was an interesting idea, it didn't break any new ground. I mean, a woman discovers her husband isn't what she thought he was...been there, done that. Story of my life. At best, a sure contender for the Lifetime Channel. But it was the sheer mundane-ness of this movie that made it so intriguing and ultimately disturbing.I could emotionally relate to Darcy as she discovered that her husband was the infamous Beadie, but what intrigued me even more was her response.Darcy's final conversation with a guy obsessed with tracking down Beadie was poignant. Here, he's spent a huge chunk of his life chasing down a serial killer only to be forced to reexamine his own life and learn that things aren't always so cut-and-dried or black-and-white as they initially seem.In the final analysis, ""A Good Marriage"" may have been too real and down-to-earth for Stephen King loyalists and people accustomed to high drama, but if you can appreciate an intimate, subtle, slow burning character study I think you will be pleasantly surprised."
" To be forgotten
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,6,"""A good marriage"" is a movie that goes with the flow. It tells its story without the big heights or downs. In short is settles around a loving wife which has to discover, that her beloved husband is responsible for the murder of several women, leaving her with the choice how to continue.Unfortunately, the film isn't really thrilling. Once the basic story is revealed, there is actually not much happening anymore, neither in a form of plot twists, nor in a form of a closer psychological depiction of the main character. Therefore, it appears quite unlikely many times because the woman just seems to accept what she finds out while her husband isn't really showing any regret at all. It is puzzling how she more or less just continues her life with him. That is until all of a sudden she goes berserk and kills him, quite out of the blue. But even then there's not really much tension.I've surely seen worse. You can give this film a watch and probably won't heavily regret it but I have to say that it isn't special. If that fits what you're looking for, ""A good marriage"" will serve you well."
