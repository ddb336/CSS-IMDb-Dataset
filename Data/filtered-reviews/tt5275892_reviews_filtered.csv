" Masterclass of documentary film
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,10,"Sure you can say its too long. But its this long because it NEEDS to be this long. Other films, such as The Irishman and Motherless Brooklyn are too long. They could have been cut down. This film, this 8+ hour long film, figured out how to appropriately represent all it needed to say in this length of time. I constantly think of this film in the highest standard and I could care less about football!"
" A Solid Documentary
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,8,"Reliving someone's life, success and hideous actions is a dedicated work. Edelman pulls it off to this viewer's delight. Nearly 8 hours is tough because not too many people will actually watch it in one sitting (one weekend can be tough for some) but it is worth the effort. My only complaint is WHY are these things put together with worthless, LOUD piano music being played when people are talking? It makes a lot of dialogue hard to hear."
" GOLD STANDARD!!!!!
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,10,"Seriously, this should be mandatory viewing in schools....it covers everything....If you haven't watched it, I immediately lose respect for you.....I'm 49 years old....I'm incredibly lazy, and have watched way more than my share of the idiot box....that said, this is the best thing to ever have been filmed. I could ramble on for days to back up my argument, but, again, I'm extremely lazy. You'll just have to take my word for it....Even the music, the score, is perfection.....Just watch it....if you have a working brain in your head, you'll agree with me.....It's the best ever."
" A masterful documentary that earns its epic length
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,9,"There are many documentaries out there- particularly on Netflix- that are just far too long. I can understand why, because owing to the way streaming services work, it's surely tempting to extend a documentary beyond the standard two-ish hours into a multi-part 6-10 hour miniseries, because that keeps viewers hooked into whatever service they're subscribed to. In all honesty, I'm personally a little tired of this approach, particularly because I think most subjects can be thoroughly explored within the length of a movie, if the director and editor and everyone else involved know what they're doing.This naturally made me very cautious to watch OJ: Made In America, despite how critically acclaimed it was. While it was released in a very limited theatrical release- and won an Oscar for Best Documentary before the Academy changed their rules to disqualify lengthy works broken into parts- it did look to me like it would be another true crime miniseries that would draw itself out longer than necessary. Furthermore, I was worried it would be tacky and disrespectful the way many documentary miniseries are; if you're teasing and using real life tragic events as cliffhangers or hooks for viewers, for example, I think that's pretty twisted.Thankfully, OJ: Made In America managed to transcend all of its similar contemporaries. This is miles better than something like Making A Murderer or any other show trying to chase its success; it goes in depth and uses its incredibly long runtime to tell a huge story and cover many, many topics in gripping and compelling detail. It's much more than a story about the double murder that OJ Simpson was accused of committing, and it's even more than just a documentary about OJ Simpson. The hint's in the title: it uses the story of Simpson to tell a huge, almost epic story about crime, race relations, and societal conflict throughout the last few decades of history.It's hard to unpack everything, but you will find something interesting and intensely thought provoking within this documentary. It's not so much about trying to prove whether Simpson committed the crime or not, and moreso just giving as many points of view, opinions, and insights as possible. It's superbly edited, and flows in a way where despite all the information, you never get lost or confused. And furthermore, despite the risk of information overload, you never really get bored either. Despite watching this in chunks, I could have happily digested the entire seven and a half hours in one sitting, and if I ever rewatch it one day maybe I will view it in that way.It's hard to come up with too many flaws. I'm conflicted over the use of graphic crime scene and autopsy photos in Part 4 of the documentary- some viewers may not understand the intensity and viciousness of the murder with verbal descriptions alone, but I feel like some people are appropriately disturbed with just picturing the aftermath in their head, and for those people, seeing the images themselves may feel like overkill. As such, I understand why those photos were included, but personally don't feel like I needed to be exposed to them. And I mean, could it have been six and a half hours instead of seven and a half? It's almost silly to think about that as a flaw, so I'm not sure it is, but at the same time... maybe it could've got more or less the same thing across?I guess I'm struggling to think of flaws, or justify why I got this to 4.5/5 but not 5/5. On a rewatch, I may realise that this is about as good as documentaries can get, and raise the rating. For now, I can say that it's truly excellent and among the best documentaries I've ever seen, regardless of whether you choose to watch it as a miniseries or an extremely long feature.Regardless of your thoughts on OJ Simpson and the infamous court case he was involved in, you will find things to appreciate, fixate on, and ponder throughout this incredibly impressive and borderline 'epic' documentary."

" WOW
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,9,"Maybe the best documentary I've ever seen. I wasn't that familiar with O.J.'s fame or with the whole case, I only knew he killed his wife before this. The documentary really gave me all the informations I needed to know. We live in a society..."
" Good Documentary
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,5,This shows it all. If one wants to be informed on this scenario through visual form.....this is the documentary to go to.Great work by the crew to put this together in a perfect filmmaking fashion.
" Brilliant!
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,"As someone from the Middle East who knows a little about the history of the United States in the 20th century, I must say that this documentary showed me a lot of interesting facts about the lives of African-American people."
" Incredible
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,10,The #1 best documentary I have ever watched! From beginning too end the way they portrayed the case in relation too America was nearly perfect
" I'm not black, I'm O.J... OKAY.
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,9,"One of The Best Documentaries Ever Made, A deep look at race, culture, and media interaction of an icon's rise and fall."
" Long and exhausting but amongst the best documentaries ever made
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Seven and a half hours is a long time to be sat watching something that has been documented, in both factual and fictional programming, extensively before. First of all, yes, it is a very long watch and it is emotionally and mentally exhausting to watch but it is simply amongst the greatest documentaries of all time.As I said, much has been said about the OJ Simpson trials before, but this is so much more than that. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the real theme and story of the documentary isn't about OJ Simpson at all, but instead it is about Race, as both a snapshot of specific periods in history and in contemporary America.The documentary is split into 5 parts, each an hour and a half in length. Part one focuses on OJ as an athlete and how Race in America was dealt with as a subject within the 60's and early 70's period. Part two begins to move on with Race up through the 80's and 90's, showing how African Americans were being treated by police and viewed as a community by white society, whilst explaining how OJ distances himself from these Black struggles and viewpoints.Part three talks about the lead-up to the murders, Part four the court trial and Part five the aftermath.But throughout we are reminded constantly how Race was such an important issue to play through this narrative. By the end we are left feeling that the gap between white and black is so far stretched we wonder where it can be pulled back together.Some people may very well come to this documentary looking for a comprehensive examination of the murder trials. There is lots of details in this documentary (some extremely hard - and graphic - to watch and listen to) and it as good as comprehensively explains everything that should and needs to be explained regarding OJ Simpson himself, but the trial isn't fully comprehensive examined. Lots of detail, yes, but NOT FULLY EXAMINED. If you want that, look elsewhere.This documentary is arguably in the top ten of the best documentaries ever made. Not because it examines a controversial and morbidly fascinating subject, but because it examines the reasons and history behind it.I know that OJ Simpson was guilty of those murders and never could understand how that jury let him go. But this documentary offers answers as to why the jury did what they did. Lots of questions are raised along the way, most certainly, but for the very first time I understand why history played out as it did.Stunning watch and should be viewed by everyone, just be aware that some scenes are not for the faint-hearted or squeamish."
" Very Nearly A Perfect Documentary
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,10,"I have long been a fan of the ""ESPN 30 For 30"" series of documentaries as, I believe, they peel back the stories behind the athletes, the sport, and tap into a more human element. And the standout of this series of films has to be ""O.J.: Made In America.""I came along in late 1983, ten years after Simpson hit 2000 yards in a season, so I didn't understand him as the great sports icon he was, even as I was (and still am) a fan of the team he did it with, the Buffalo Bills. I knew him mostly as the sideline guy on NFL broadcasts, and I had seen a few of the Hertz Rent-A-Car commercials he had done. As I wasn't even ten years old at the time of the murders of Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman, I remember thinking ""how can this guy be at the center of this drama?"" I certainly didn't understand anything about race relations, why Los Angeles was on the verge of tearing itself apart, or any of those other soul-searching issues that you know you have to try to do something about, but you never know what exactly you can do.Even when I began to get a better, but far from a complete, understanding of the world as it is (well after the 'not guilty' verdict had been given), I remember watching ""The Naked Gun"" series of movies and thinking ""how could O.J. go from being so likeable to this monster?"" because he was genuinely funny and charming in those movies.For me, this documentary comes about the closest I believe to answering the why and the how. Without coming right out and saying it, I believe Ezra Edelman shows that even at the height of Simpson's popularity and charisma, there was a sense of ""it's all about me"" that, perhaps, he initially tried to fight against when he refused to do a post-game interview without having his teammates with him, but then eventually gave in to as his playing career was coming to a close. And it only grew stronger culminating in the S.W.A.T. team negotiator seeing that he needed to appeal to O.J.'s ego in order to talk him out of the Bronco without creating more of an incident, a conclusion he came to after seeing how his home was decorated with no pictures of his family present.For as brilliant a documentary as this is though, and for as comprehensive as it is looking into the background of what made O.J. what he was, if there is one thing I would knock it for it's that it doesn't explore how domestic violence and athletic entertainment can go hand in hand. I think it could be argued that the focus of this documentary was on O.J., his own struggle with racial identity and how it's juxtaposed against the national struggle with it, and that's why domestic violence, while certainly not forgotten, wasn't highlighted. If I could make a suggestion though, maybe as a followup to this documentary, it would be to explore how domestic and sexual abuse play into the lives of athletes, former athletes, and coaches. Certainly looking at O.J. and even the Penn State program under Joe Paterno would make for compelling viewing. But maybe, just maybe, we wouldn't like what such a documentary reveals."
" Interrogator: ""It's not like you want to murder people"". Answer cop: "" Sure we do. We'd love to""
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,8,"Before O.J. Simpson went to trial for his alleged killing of his WHITE ex-girlfriend, Rodney King was violently beaten by LAPD officers during his arrest, while he wasnt resisting in any way. The incident was covered by news media around the world and dominated headlines for weeks on end.The four officers were tried on charges of use of excessive force, but were all acquitted. Within hours of the acquittals, the 1992 Los Angeles riots started, sparked by outrage among African Americans over the verdicts. The rioting lasted six days, during which 63 people were killed and 2,373 were injured; it ended only after the California Army National Guard, the United States Army, and the United States Marine Corps provided reinforcements to re-establish control.After all these racism fuelled riots, the O.J trial happened in which ANOTHER white cop was suspected of racism against African-Americans.
The of racism suspected cop Mark Fuhrman was interrogated. Question by the Interrogator: ""It's not like you want to murder people"". Answer of the cop: "" Sure we do. We'd love to"".The above quote was a literal excerpt from a tape on which LAPD cop Mark Fuhrman literally mentioned that he liked to kill people. He even wanted to resign from the police force because he himself noticed his racist mindset was troubling, mentioning that he liked ""to break the arms and legs of n8gg88*s and mexicans"".Read the above line again and still have NO reasonable doubts that the LAPD cop Mark Fuhrman could have framed O.J. Simpson.Did O.J commit a crime? Who cares. Racism was on trial. Not O.J. Simpson.Definitely highly recommended for anyone wanting to understand the racial sensitivities in American society or American society in general.It is a 5 part documentary. The juicy part of the trial is in part 3 and 4 and the beginning of part 5. That would suffice. Although I watched everything in the end, because it was such a fascinating portrait of American society and it's heroes and villains..."
" Absolutely spellbinding
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,9,"As someone who knew nothing of O.J. Simpson and his life, and as someone with little to no interest in American politics, sports and history, this was one of the most captivating and thought-provoking docu-series out there."
" I am surprized I could connect to it being an Indian
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Before watching this documentary I never knew about such racism in US or about OJ simpson. But this was one hell of a ride I could completely relate to it. The documentary made me feel for the plight of the black community, it felt as if Nicole was a dear friend. Despite of the fact that OJ got the maximum screentime the director made sure it becomes extremely difficult to empathise with OJ.One thing which was kind of disturbing was that the American judicial system is completely flawed and hardly takes facts and evidences into consideration."
" In detail view of an American tragedy
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,10,A detailed view of the life of the infamous O.J. Simpson starting with his NFL carrier and his rise to an American icon to his downfall caused by one night in 1994. An excellent documentary series executed to perfection.
" Reluctant to Watch. Glad I Did!
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,9,"For over a year, OJ was all America talked about. Every tiny detail or gossip was a headline. I had no interest in reliving it all by watching this movie. Then, credible sources were saying this miniseries was really quite good. It is!I had forgotten so many of the crazy and insane twists and turns of this trial. Learning more about the motivations, interactions and histories of the people involved was an eye opener. Even the jurors point of view is well done. Everyone who was in that courtroom - except OJ - desperately wanted to be there. It wasn't long before they all regretted it."
" You have to put up with SJW nonsense to find out the OJ story
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,4,"Im 23 so outside of chappelle's show and Family guy I knew nothing of OJ, except he was a murderer.This documentary is of high quality, but alot of the content is frustrating as a person with intelligence. The second episode in particular, where it tries to make you feel sorry for a thief; no."
" Re-think history (and what documentaries can be)
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,9,"Initially, I was like, ""The OJ documentary is how long?!?!"" But I never realized that this story could be a prism through which to understand race, class, privilege and celebrity in this country. And watching it while a jury debates over whether Walter Scott's killer was guilty of anything? It reminded me that many things have changed...and many things haven't. I experienced OJ's trial as a college freshman, but I didn't understand it till now."
" A little tired of OJ
",2017-12-05 00:00:00,7,"Clearly this was a very cool in depth look but I think America was a little tired of the story. Between the other doc done and the A&E show being put out just before this, the story had been told over and over. That being said, this was definitely the most in depth and will probably live on in history. Kudos to the team - must have been quite the undertaking."
" One of The Best Documentaries Ever Made
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""O.J.: Made in America"" (2016) was without a doubt one of the very best documentaries I've ever seen, maybe even actually the best one - and i saw a few to say the least. Although i do not live in America, i knew about some of these events before seen ""O.J.: Made in America"" (2016). It did not surprise me that at the end of this amazing documentary i end up almost seemingly seen a chapter from America's history, because it took for this series almost 8 hours to do it. What i was surprised about is that i couldn't imagine at the beginning that it was going to be done so convincingly great and crystal clear. ""O.J.: Made in America"" features 5 episodes that all runs for almost 8 hours. But let this not scare you if kinda thinking to see it - i can't remember when the last time i was so absorb when watching a documentary. ""O.J"" himself is shown here at center of events. Basically it is a biopic about his life, but at the same time if features events in Los Angeles that were surrounding him before and at the time of his (in)famous case. And all of this was shown in a very crystal clear fashion - i literally couldn't put this series down until its final frame.Overall, ""O.J.: Made in America"" is magnificent look at the America's history. At the center of the event is ""O.J."" himself and its a fascinating look at the true American tragedy as one person puts it. Definitely one of the very, very best documentaries ever made."
" So he is not black enough?
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,1,"A documentary should be like a silent objective observer, that wants to let the bigger picture paint itself, by including a balanced amount of relevant sources. That is definitely not the case here.This ""documentary"" doesn't do it's job. It argues O.J. Simpson isn't black enough for there to be any possibility of racist motives about the trial and investigation around him.White old ""expert"" men tell the story to us viewers, of what the situation of black people in the US were prior to the case with O.J. Simpson. And how we viewers should interpret O.J. in particular. Many of the things these white old men say, are so out there, it's shocking this could even be considered for an Academy Award.It seems the only black people who get to speak, are ones who knew O.J. from his school days, and they barely comment on the case itself.This documentary is quite sloppy constructed from the start, by leaving out so much. We practically learn nothing about O.J.'s life prior to his breakthrough as an American football player. The footage used is very blurred, constantly repeated, and you almost get dizzy trying to keep up as they move back and forth in time. It seems like they had barely no access to footage about O.J., and no intention of telling a story. They rather paint their own story, which has no direct relevance to neither O.J. nor the trial.An agenda would had been perfectly fine though, if it didn't appear to have such obvious preconceived motives. Why didn't they describe Nicole more and her background? Why didn't they tell this story from a woman's perspective, who was beaten by her husband? It takes a long time before they even mention her at all.This entire ""documentary"" is highly embarrassing. It fails in editing, and even in building up sympathies for the agendas it has. It's rather a political statement that doesn't care for a second what O.J. did and did not do. Rather whether he is black enough to justify calling anyone a racist."
" An ambitious, ground-breaking production that pays off marvellously
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,10,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning O.J. Simpson had it all: fame, fortune and adoration by millions of fans, a sporting icon on a par with Muhammed Ali or Joe Frazier. He had travelled from the ghetto to the open arms of Los Angeles, where his prowess on the football field amazed everyone, playing a big part in winning the UCLA 1967 football tournament. He broke through the racial divide of the time, and was accepted into the predominantly white society, taking him away from the troubles and upheavals that the majority of African Americans were caught up in in America at the time. Whilst Ali took a stand by refusing to fight in Vietnam, and two black American athletes were sent home for making a black power gesture, he soaked up the celebrity lifestyle, detaching himself completely. As his football career drew to a close, he began a relationship with white waitress Nicole Brown, after his first marriage had collapsed, which got everyone talking, but masked a volatile and destructive home life, which would result in a double homicide.And so began the 'trial of the century', with a massive sports icon on trial. But the very thing that O.J. had ignored on his way up, would be the very thing that saved him on his way down. In the late 80s and early 90s, L.A. was once again in the grip of a massive race war, with the African American community getting caught up in various episodes of excessive force from the police and instances of individual injustice, culminating in the acquittal of several white police officers in the heavy beating of Rodney King. With a heavy blow, the predominantly black jury swung their revenge, and O.J. was set free. But afterwards, his life descended into a tawdry, degrading mess, where he ended up finding himself caught up in a robbery at gunpoint in a Las Vegas hotel room that did result in his incarceration.I still feel too young to be having distant memories, but the trial of O.J. Simpson is one thing I do remember from far back during the summer of 1995, while I was on holiday in Florida as an eleven year old kid, to his earth shattering acquittal when I was back on these shores. Even at such a young age, I, like many others, was astonished at his getting freed when all the evidence quite clearly pointed to his guilt, but this served to highlight the mind blowing power of money and celebrity, and the incredulous fortunes it can afford you. With such a dark cloud hanging over his head, Simpson has never been allowed to fade into the background, popping up here and there as a point of interest. Filmmaker Ezra Edelman has produced this ultra thorough, in-depth dissection of the man, through his calculated rise to the top as a member of an oppressed community, through to the false image of a devoted husband despite the turbulent home life, and his worrying lack of emotion after Nicole's death.Even in the days when epic, large scale productions were the norm, seven and a half hours would have been a massive ask for anyone, so it's best if you prepare yourself in advance and strap yourself in for the course, but luckily it's all broken into three parts, and the payoff is an absorbing, thoroughly engrossing production, that leaves absolutely no stone unturned and leaves you feeling as though you've been on a journey in film like absolutely nothing else you've seen before. *****"
" A mesmerising telling of OJ Simpson's story, before, during and after the 1995 trial
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,8,"I couldn't wait to watch this acclaimed documentary since I had only a superficial understanding of what happened during the 1995 trial. At the time of the resounding 'Not guilty' verdict I remember thinking that in America money could buy you out of prison even with overwhelming evidence against you.Ezra Edelman's documentary brilliantly adds maximum perspective to the original verdict. That OJ Simpson was, at heart, a man from the ghetto who would talk himself out of most situations (even if that meant leaving his buddies behind to save his neck) and as a man who reneged on his roots to enjoy the high life as the equal to other affluent (white) people. This last point is essential since this makes playing the 'race card' during the criminal trial even more outrageous (if that is indeed possible), but it also explains that the man was so obsessed with his image that he became just a big psychotic narcissist: an affable successful man in public and an extremely insecure (jealous and paranoid towards others but in denial about himself) thus prone to bursts of violent rage in his private life.The documentary also does a great job of describing the history of LAPD abuses against minorities. Simpson's defence posse eventually tried to connect this ugly context with the criminal case. Actually it was enough for the jury (already prejudiced in favour of Simpson) to think there was at least a reasonable doubt that all the evidence pointing at OJ's unmistakable guilt was not reliable. Which is silly because the defence strategy was about describing a litany of hypothetical doubts, not proving any actual weaknesses in the prosecutor's case, and wrap it under the argument that the LAPD has a history of gross misconduct against black people.As good as the documentary is presenting the facts, giving us a fascinating insight into the so-called ""Trial of the Century"", I felt I lacked something. I mean the 'Non-Guilty' verdict is even more disturbing after this comprehensive review. You just cannot believe that the ""race card"" just won the case. So I went on the read Vincent Bugliosi analysis of the trial (Outrage, the 5 reasons why OJ Simpson got away with murder) and I was thus able to link the dots: the prosecution fumbled his way through a truckload of sound evidence (plus another mountain of circumstantial evidence). You actually have a hint of this in Made in America: Christopher Darden is presented giving in to the defence tease to have Simpson try the gloves on. But for the most part direct testimony from Marcia Clark weights in on the overall 'Fatality thesis': this case was doomed from the start for the DA's office. It's like bad things happened for the poor prosecuting team (there were 2 dozens attorneys working the case !) but they had no way of preventing it or making up for the lost ground...I understand it is difficult to line up witnesses to sit in front of the camera and kind of stab them in the back by pointing the finger at them. I understand the focus of the documentary cannot be lost on a deep analysis of the trial yet there lacks one essential commentary at some point between the 5th and 7th hour of the storytelling. More precisely it seems strange that Mark Fuhrman is left alone defending himself for what happened when the prosecutors dumped him like a pestiferous witness in 1995, and with Marcia Clark continuing to blame him 20 years after (despite her dismal work in court she earned millions to write her whining account)."

",2017-07-04 00:00:00,10,"As a child of the early 90's, growing up I was aware of OJ Simpson and the trial of the century, in as much as you learn to vividly recall seeing images of a glove that doesn't fit but what I most surely wasn't aware of was the backstory behind what made Orenthal James ""Juice"" Simpson the figure he was and the landscape in America that was surrounding him at the time of his trial for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown and unfortunate bystander Ron Goldman.An exhaustive 7 hour documentary commissioned by ESPN films and the winner of this year's Best Documentary Feature at the Academy Awards, Ezra Edelman's layered and insightful examination of OJ Simpson from his rise to a football god to a washed up party animal that is now still serving time for armed robbery and kidnapping, is all anyone would ever need to get a fully-fledged rundown of the history behind one of America's greatest icon's spectacular fall from grace.While the story of OJ from a sporting star and a culture crossing media sensation right through to his days suited up in court would be enough to cover countless hours of fascinating viewing, one of the most impressive feats of Edelman's documentary is the way in which he incorporates various other components into his film to give context to what was laying behind the scenes of OJ's superstardom and the time when he was under the watchful eye of America and the world, as his trial made its way into people's lounge rooms across the globe.Its truly fascinating getting glimpses into OJ's early life as he transcended race to become a favourite of American's, both white and black and Edelman's carefully constructed examination of the racial tension and history behind animosity between the police force in the USA (within Los Angeles in particular) and the black community ended up influencing and increasing the publics fierce following of the OJ trial.It's likely there will never be a sporting star like Simpson or a celebrity that had such universal pulling power over a huge collection of fans and races and it's surely safe to say that there would never be a case like the Simpson case, which makes looking back on it all these years on as intense as it ever was. These facts make Edelman's documentary (really a mini-series) a must watch for those both new to the case like me or for those that remember not only the Juice as an on field deity, but a man brought down from the highest highs to the lowest of lows.Final Say – O.J: Made in America is an absolute must watch. You need not be either a sports fan or an OJ acolyte to be pulled in and captivated by Edelman's extensively researched and carefully put together product, that acts as not only an essential look at OJ's life and trial but also a heartbreaking look at how the mighty can fall from great heights with a resounding crash.5 Heisman Trophy's out of 5"
" Deserves an Oscar
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,8,"I give this a 4 out of 5 Netflix stars which translates into an 8 here. The very first scene had me hooked seeing OJ looking like a despondent old man sitting in front of a Nevada parole board It actually made me feel sorry for him. After finishing the 8 hours I felt numb -- the ending neither happy nor sad -- just tragic. This entire saga was tragedy at so many different layers and so convoluted and twisted even Shakespeare himself couldn't write such a story.They had a good mix of interviewees that provided insight they must have been culling these past 20 years. Carl Douglas, former Dream Team lawyer who significantly contributed to this documentary, brings it home at the end with his 5th quarter metaphor. Nicely done.The trial sections relied heavily on the prosecutors Marcia Clark and Gil Garcetti. They never were asked why this trial took 8 months and not a couple of weeks. They didn't have to present every single piece of evidence. One juror briefly mentions how she was basically imprisoned for the entire trial. Didn't anyone think this could be a problem and perhaps cut to the chase? They lay all the blame on the glove incident on Darden. Wasn't Marcia Clark or Gil Garcetti his boss?Since Clark and Garcetti were such big contributors to this documentary I felt the producers didn't want to put them in a bad light. Even Fuhrman gets to do some mea culpa. The reason this trial turned into a circus is because everyone liked the stage. Everyone wanted the limelight to last forever -- even Judge Ito, who isn't interviewed. The ring leader controls the circus and in this trial that was the late Johnny Cochran."

" Juiced
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,8,"This Oscar winning documentary is a gargantuan effort to watch clocking in at nearly 8 hours in length. I am not sure it should had been eligible for an Oscar given it really is a television documentary series albeit a comprehensive one.OJ Simpson was a black man in a poor neighbourhood who grew up to become a prominent footballer. He left behind his black roots to live a comfortable life in LA. Once his career finished he became a sports commentator and an actor. He also became wealthy. He then achieved notoriety when his ex wife and her boyfriend were found murdered and he stood trial for their murders and later acquitted.This documentary has footage of family, friends, foes to examine every facet of his life. OJ would get into trouble at high school but as his friends mentioned, he would always get away with it because of his prowess as an athlete.The most revealing think I learned about OJ as a youngster was that his father was bisexual/gay.The trial bit was the least interesting thing about it even though it attempts to juxtapose US race relations of that era such as the Rodney King beatings from a few years earlier. It is just that I have seen dramas and documentaries about this before as well the real life trial scenes being covered by television networks at the time.My own personal view of the trial was that the prosecution and the police forensics team did an inept job. Mark Fuhrman might be a racist but it seems he might had been the only competent cop on that crime scene. OJs defence team raised doubts on the forensic evidence, made the prosecution witnesses including police officers look bad and then there was the glove that was too tight to fit on Simpson. Just makes you think, if this was how poor the police and prosecution were for a high profile case, what are they like for everyday crimes?After the trial and we get to hear from Fred Goldman himself, the father of Ron Goldman. Now it is like a cat and mouse thriller. Fred angry with the travesty of the criminal verdict launches a civil suit against Simpson and wins damages. As Fred said, all he had was a piece of paper, the court order in itself was nothing.Fred Goldman relentlessly goes on to enforce the court order and doggedly goes after Simpson's assets to satisfy the claim for damages. It took some years but it led to Simpson being hit by a sucker punch as he broke into a Las Vegas casino hotel room to retrieve his memorabilia which landed him in jail for a very long time.A lot has been said of the OJ story being a Shakespearean tragedy. I just think he was a vain, shallow man, not too bright but cunning who did not realise what a good life he managed to achieve. Upon the time of his arrest for the murders, he had become a worldwide name because of The Naked Gun films. Now he is just a stupid crook in jail."
" Payback for Rodney King and prosecution's failure to challenge ludicrous defense police conspiracy theory highlight brilliant 7 1/2 hour documentary
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Seven and a half hours in length and in five parts, OJ: Made in America can best be described as ""Everything you wanted to know about OJ (and race in America) but were afraid to ask."" OJ: Made in America is like a giant jig-saw puzzle, and it's up to you to figure out the lessons learned (if any) among the participants in the sordid spectacle known as ""The Trial of the Century."" Ezra Edelman produced and directed OJ: Made in America (""OJ:MIA"") and was determined from the outset to show the connection between the OJ Trial and the history of resentment built up in the African-American community as a result of years (if not centuries) of discrimination, racism and outright violence perpetrated against it. Hence at the very time OJ came onto the scene as a star football player for the University of Southern California (USC), the Watts riots were happening right next door to the campus, depicted as a bastion of white privilege.Ironically, the most popular man on campus at that time was OJ himself, who was determined to ingratiate himself with an all-white student body, oblivious to what was going on in the larger community right outside his doorstep. OJ was so determined to shed any connection to his black roots that you can hear him saying on the archival footage, ""I'm not black, I'm OJ!"" It was no accident years later that OJ's defense team changed all the pictures in his house featuring his associations with a myriad of white friends and replaced them with pictures of his black relatives in order to give the majority black jury the impression that maybe he wasn't an Uncle Tom, as some militants had accused him of being during his years as a professional NFL player and Hertz rent-a-car pitchman.By the time his playing days were over, OJ had basically given up most of his connections to the lower middle- class black community where he grew up, married Nicole Brown, a white woman, and moved to the gated ""white"" Brentwood suburb of Los Angeles. As he later admitted, he didn't pay much attention to the concerns of his fellow blacks as he was more determined to make it as a man of wealth and privilege in a white world.Edelman spends a good deal of time chronicling the Rodney King beating incident and its aftermath in order to remind us of the injustice of the first trial and the resentment it caused in the black community not only in the Los Angeles area but across the entire country. It is within this atmosphere that the OJ jury was seated. Interviews with various community ""activists"" make it clear that most people in the black community saw OJ as a symbol (or cause célèbre if you will), with the verdict already pre-determined, as payback for the Rodney King trial.This is borne out by one of two interviews with two actual jurors from the trial. Juror #9, a feisty older black woman, who asserted that 90% of the people on the jury had made up their minds from the beginning, not only as payback for Rodney King but as s he put it, ""to protect our own."" Juror #9 comes off in OJ:MIA as one of the most fascinating characters in the documentary. On one hand, she had little sympathy for Nicole Brown, unable to understand why domestic violence victims are unable to leave their husbands despite enduring horrendous physical abuse and constant psychological humiliation. On the other hand, Juror #9 is one of the few African Americans initially sympathetic to OJ who was willing to concede later on that he was probably guilty!In contrast, Juror #2, a middle-aged black woman, is much more circumspect. She maintained that, because of their mistakes, the prosecution team failed to make their case. Unlike Juror #9, Juror #2 isn't willing to concede that the prosecution team was dealing with an inherently biased jury. But even barring that, the defense team still had to get around the problem of all of the victims' blood mixed in with OJ's DNA found at the scene. Juror #2's solution is to dismiss all police testimony by basically blaming Mark Fuhrman as unreliable since she was personally offended by his use of N-word and lying about it on the stand. But the defense team argued that ALL the police (including Vanatter, the chief detective) were involved in a grand conspiracy to mix OJ's blood with the victims.By that logic, any future defense attorney could argue that police testimony is tainted since you can't trust any of them due to inherent racism. The argument of a grand police conspiracy sounds even more ludicrous considering the victim involved. OJ was a friend of the police and even though a few had knowledge of OJ's abuse of Nicole, the police never stopped coming over to his house in friendship before the murders. Juror #2 was probably right about the prosecution bungling the case but not for the ""mistakes"" she cites. Instead, it appears more obvious that the prosecution failed to challenge the ludicrousness of the defense's notion of a vast police conspiracy, accepted uncritically by an already biased jury. OJ:MIA documents the shock many in the white community felt at what they regarded was an unjust verdict. Somehow they expected many in the African-American community to take the ""high road"" and look at the case objectively—instead, it was purely an ""emotional"" verdict based on years of resentment—the ""taste of victory"" was more important than really analyzing the defense's flimsy case which was principally based on massive generalizations and crude innuendo.In the end OJ did get his just desserts. He thought he was going to return to his regular routine only to discover that he was now a pariah and eventually an inmate to boot. For O.J.: what goes around, comes around!"
" Engrossing Recreation of a Terrible Moment in American Culture
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,9,"A blistering and engrossing documentary about the O.J. Simpson murder trial that explores how the sensational event became a symbol for the racial tension that was just waiting to boil over in Los Angeles in particular and the United States in general.I was in college when the O.J. story happened, and I only half paid attention to it at the time, so it was fascinating for me to watch this film that seemed like a new version of an old story. The film makes no attempt to hide the filmmakers' opinion that the innocent verdict in the case was a gross miscarriage of justice, but I have to admit that, though I've always believed O.J. was guilty too, I would probably have acquitted him myself as a juror based on the dismal way the prosecution handled the case.But the grossest outrage about the whole event -- I felt it at the time and I felt it again watching the movie -- is that the murders that made the whole trial necessary in the first place were forgotten amid the racial baiting and the defense's willingness to capitalize on the emotions of an angry and disenfranchised black community. A seven-hour documentary may sound daunting at the beginning, but I challenge you not to binge watch it.Winner of the 2016 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature, a complete no brainer of a win.Grade: A"
" As detailed, powerful and gripping as documentary film-making gets
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,9,"On June 12th, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson, the ex-wife of lauded American football player and all-round superstar O.J. Simpson, was murdered, along with her friend Ron Goldman. Both were stabbed multiple times, with Nicole's injuries so severe that her head was almost completely severed from her body. The crime scene was appalling and was clearly the aftermath of a frenzied attack, with all evidence pointing to O.J.. What followed was truly the biggest media sensation of our time; a circus in the ugliest sense of the word which divided America between blacks and whites. The case continues to fascinate, and despite the many documentaries covering the trial, Ezra Edelman's O.J.: Made in America finds new ground to cover, interviewing practically anyone caught up in the trial and juxtaposing O.J.'s story with that of the horror of growing up black in Los Angeles.Released as a five-part mini-series on ESPN for their 30 to 30 series, Made in America also made a limited appearance on cinema screen, and received its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. Controversially, this qualified it as a feature and for the Best Documentary Academy Award (which it won), and watched as a whole the film runs at a whopping 7 hours plus. But anyone who states it was undeserved needs to watch the film again, as this is about as detailed, powerful and utterly gripping as documentary film-making gets. It seems to cover just about every angle, bringing in anybody who was anybody in the events leading up to the murder and the aftermath for revealing interviews, as well as boasting a stunning collection of archive footage. It's meticulously researched stuff, and even if you know the long-studied case back to front, you will still find something new. Starting way back, we are taken through O.J.'s rise as a star college football player, leaping over or barging through anybody who stood in his way. He was worshipped almost like a God, and took this success to an unhappy period as a professional playing in Buffalo, where he was away from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. We move through his tearful retirement to his move into acting, where he appeared in the likes of Capricorn One (1977) and The Naked Gun (1988), and his successful run as the face of Hertz. There's also his initially sweeping love affair with a beautiful young blonde named Nicole Brown, before the reports of domestic violence began. We witness a black man becoming a superstar in a white world that falsely preached equality, and he sat comfortably in that world while his fellow African- Americans were suffering terrible abuse at the hands of the law. Time and time again we witness a black man, woman or child murdered, beaten or treated like a dog by the police, only for them to be acquitted of the crime. Payback, it would seem, was on the cards, as the trial of O.J. Simpson began.We are left in no question as to whether or not O.J. did it. He comes across as a master manipulator, ready to throw anybody under the bus - and have them be grateful at the same time - if it will give him a foot forward. A controlling, egotistical bully who would leave visible prints of his boot on Nicole's face, he is truly the worst kind of scumbag. The outcome of the trial certainly isn't excused (the prosecutor reminds the court late on that nobody seems to remember than Nicole and Ron were the actual victims), but it goes some way to explain it. You can feel the anger brewing as the film goes on, and through some truly disturbing footage of the Rodney King beating and the murder of Latasha Harlin, makes you angry with them. It portrays an entire country divided, with the trial playing out as an obvious metaphor for a nation in complete disarray, while the disgusting flaws in the American Justice System are exposed to a bleary-eyed prosecution. It's a work of true scholarship and unyielding ambition, and a frightening indictment of just how little has changed."
" Excellent documentary which shows how celebrity and reality TV drive the US
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,10,"I wanted to watch Made in America not because of what the show said about OJ, but for what it revealed about American society and how it's changed- or hasn't changed- since the early 1990s. Made in America tells several stories, beginning with the story of how OJ rose from his upbringing in public housing in San Francisco to become a sports star. I wasn't convinced by the show's portrayal of OJ as a legend beloved by the whole country. I was in primary school when he was making his name in football, and I wasn't a sports fan. I heard about the Juice from my older brother. In the early 70s though the big event for us was the Perfect Season Miami Dolphins. I spotted the name Mercury Morris in one of the newspaper articles shown on camera, and I hit pause so I could read it. While I grew up in Miami in the 70s and 80s the city had several riots sparked off by police officers being acquitted for shooting and killing African Americans. My parents lived in an affluent suburb and they didn't pay much attention to the race problems, except to advise me not to drive downtown when the problems were happening. I recognised the feelings of anger and frustration expressed by the African American community and the people interviewed for the film. I don't know if it was possible for OJ to have a fair trial. I sensed that LAPD and Los Angeles city officials were terrified that a guilty verdict would result in more riots and city wide destruction. While I was watching the footage in the episode about the verdict, I was struck that as the crowds in the streets shouted in joy when they heard OJ had been found not guilty the police horses whinnied in fright and the officers riding them struggled to keep them from bolting. I was shocked to learn that one of the jurors, who raised his hand in a Black Power salute, had been a member of the Black Panthers. Why didn't the prosecution ask for a mistrial? At any rate, OJ's expensive lawyers decided to play the race card from the start. I thought it was despicable, and Made in America's revealing that Simpson had distanced himself from the Civil Rights struggles made me feel it was even more despicable.Most of all OJ Made in America revealed the fascination that riveted the media in the US to the Simpson trial, and the fascination that the world media had as well. They weren't concerned so much about race-- the trial took place in Los Angeles, and discussed the racism of the LAPD, in the Rodney King case and many others, but above all it was all about Brentwood and Hollywood, celebrity, fame, and money. The People vs OJ Simpson showed that from the very beginning witnesses and people who claimed they they knew the truth were selling their stories to tabloid newspapers and trash TV shows. I wonder if Simpson would have had as much support from the public if he were rich- rich enough to hire big name attorneys- but not a celebrity.It was the slow chase down the LA freeways that grabbed everybody's attention- here was a celebrity who might blow his brains out on live TV, because he had killed two people - or maybe he was being set up by LAPD because he was black and the victims were white. It was a great show. I don't understand why the prosecution didn't ban cameras from the courtroom like the civil trial did, or why, if they wanted to use cameras, they didn't make them unobtrusive so the people in the courtroom couldn't see them. The trial became the media circus of the century. The last episode, with clips from Simpson's bizarre reality TV show, shows how celebrity and notoriety drive the consciousness of American life. It's significant that Simpson's ultimate downfall took place after an armed robbery to gain control over his memorabilia, which not only has great personal meaning to him, but is worth millions of dollars.I had to ask myself, why did I watch Made in America? I felt sorry for Nicole - she must have found it difficult to make a life for herself apart from OJ, who not only gave her fame and money, he supported most of her family. I felt sorry for Ron Goldman for being caught up in OJ's rage because he was seen a rival for Nicole's affections, and sorry for Ron's family who saw OJ walk free from a double homicide. I felt empathy for people who felt they had been denied the justice that was given to other Americans (I felt however that the film could have included how other people of other races have been treated by the white majority- there was nothing said about how the Hispanic community felt about how they were treated by the LAPD and the US government) Mostly I was appalled by how Simpson went back to a luxurious life after the trial, selling his autographs for 3 million dollars while in jail, and was still schmoozed by people who wanted a piece of his fame. It's telling that the Goldmans struck back with court orders grabbing Simpson's money, yet Simpson managed to make more sliding into sleaziness in South Miami Beach with coke addict blonde girlfriends. People wanted to keep watching him, keep collecting his signed footballs and t shirts, and keep trying to be associated with him. Made in America holds up a mirror and finds disturbing portraits: not just of OJ, and OJ's actions, but American society's obsession with wealth and fame."
" Portrait of a nation
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,9,"O.J. Simpson was born in unpromising circumstances, but blessed with good looks, charm, and an athletic talent, grew to become one of the most famous men in America: a genius footballer, and an African American who became popular amongst all races, though the latter in part was due to his own willingness to abandon his original racial identity. But his second marriage turned bad, his suave public image increasingly at odds with his brutal treatment of his wife; and eventually, she (and her friend, and probable lover) were murdered. O.J. was on the record as having threatened them, had no alibi, and forensic evidence pointed strongly to his guilt; when the police called him in, he went on the run in a near-suicidal state, and the police followed on the freeway, trying to talk him out of doing himself in. They succeeded in this, only for O.J. to mount an extraordinary defence, in which his lawyers effectively put the Los Angeles Police Department on trial for its long and despicable history of racism. After a trial of months, a mainly black jury took just a few hours to acquit.But ostracised by the white community in which he'd made his home, O.J. soon lost a civil suit (in a different court, with a lower standard of proof), and motivated (it seems) by his desire for adulation, he fell in with a bad crowd. The new gangsta-style O.J. was perhaps no more the real man than the all-round nice guy or the evil killer; eventually, he threatened (with menaces, and armed friends in tow) someone whom he suspected of stealing his stuff and was finally sentenced to a gaol sentence that was both excessive (in the context of his latest crime) and overdue. He remain in gaol today.The strength of 'O.J.: Made in America', a marathon documentary that retells this extraordinary story, is that it brings out every facet: his remarkable sporting talent, his plastic personality, the horror of the murders, the grim reality of being poor and black in L.A., the theatre of his arrest and trial, and the sordid nature of his eventual downfall. It's long - possibly overlong - but the title is apt: this is a story that could only have happened in the U.S.A., and it says more about the country than the lurid headlines might have suggested at the time. There's no happy ending for anyone here - but what once seemed like soap opera, now feels strangely like a portrait of a nation, and yes, a dark reflection on the American dream."
" Powerful journal that many Americans should watch
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,10,"If you think this will only be about the death of two white people by the hands of rich and successful black man, you will be in for a rude surprise. You are taken on a epic voyage back in time, through the great black southern migration, to the civil rights movement, how people view these epic times. How a person can come from an isolated community and be propelled into a new environment they have no prior exposure. While the documentary gives you deep exposure to the O.J. Simpson case, some people will say that this documentary will convince you that he committed the horrid murders of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman - I still have two questions - how did a person kill two people this violently and only have traces of blood on them and no bloody clothes; how in the hell was he able to pull this off within 45 minutes and catch a plane? I have more questions than ever. But, the best thing to do before you watch this documentary. Sit down, relax, open you eyes, let your curiosity take hold and go where the filmmakers take you."
" One of the best documentaries that I've ever seen
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,10,"O.J.: Made in America is the Oscar winner for best documentary in 2016 and its well deserved. What a documentary. There is so much detail in this and so many questions answered that we didn't know would or could be answered about the infamous O.J Simpson case.I'm normally not a documentary type-guy but this had me floored. It's such an amazing piece of artistry, and being a young European I hadn't actually heard of this case before which meant that I was amazed all the way through.I first watched the dramatization of the story in The People v. O.J Simpson: American Crime story and honestly it just made this documentary even better as they're not acting. These events has ACTUALLY happened.Some may argue that it's very long for a documentary (7hr 47 min), but honestly the backstory which we get in the first couple of episodes is time well spent. It makes the impact of the final chapters of this story so much larger and makes for a more emotional ending.What made me love this story and documentary so much is that it has made me think so much about this case. I've finished the documentary a week ago and I'm STILL thinking about this documentary. That's how good it is.Wow, what a story and what an ending. Incredible. I would definitely recommend this documentary to anyone who loves film and who loves definitive stories. However, I think the documentary will have the biggest impact on you if you haven't heard much about the story and aren't fully aware of everything that happened to O.J Simpson. That being said you will still have an amazing time watching this documentary regardless if you know about the origins of this case or not."
" Well worth watching
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,9,"The first part of the three part documentary looks at the rise of a successful black African American in a world of predominately white orientation. It is aptly named ""made in America"" on account of it being a rags to riches to rags story. In the second part the public reaction to the high profile trial is documented which according to the narrative shows the justice sought by the black community in Los Angeles at the time had less to do with evidence given in court than it did with a historic sense of grievance. The narrative then presents the trial as an opportunity for the black community to redress this historic issue of racial iniquity by supporting the defendant. The notion that the issue of racism is more significant than justice for the two victims is one supported by the juror's themselves which effectively negates the possibility of a fair trial. Its all about race.In the third instalment following OJ's acquittal there is a peculiar moment where a female radio host begrudgingly admits OJ's charm and beguiling manner are affable qualities as though it is some kind of guilty pleasure to do so. There seems to be a tangible dualism that is encapsulated, on one hand a fragile sense of fraternity and on the other maintaining reservations about his innocence and past. The uneasy dichotomy between respectability and criminality remains until the trajectory towards further criminal behaviour develops in Nevada. There are parallels with the darkly humorous TV series Eastbound and Down that in this case culminate in an armed robbery that proves to be the final straw in OJ's relationship with the general public."
" Is this the final chapter?
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,9,"Well is it the final chapter? I seriously doubt it. We all must have seen numerous documentaries about OJ and what happened or didn't happen and we all have our own version of what we think happened. Some older people (like me) may remember watching this as it happened and some may have caught up after the fact but it's still a fascinating watch.This is as comprehensive as it gets, and at seven and a half hours does cover it very comprehensively. I did it in three instalments and never got bored on any occasion. It was factual, with actual footage of the trail, and is updated with commentary provided by many who were involved.I'm not gonna take sides and slam or praise anyone but be assured, you will. No matter how you think things went down you will have a good guy and bad guy scenario and like me you will become a little louder than normal.Well worth a watch even though it takes a while."
" Simply put: this is the ultimate documentary (and not just about the O.J. case)
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,10,"Watching a 7.5-hour long documentary about a case we all think we know may seem a daunting task at first, but trust me: you'll have a very hard time to resist the urge to binge watch the whole mini series once you've started. This documentary (which to me felt like a seven-and-a-half-hour feature film) is - in my humble opinion - one of the greatest achievements in American filmmaking and utterly captivating from the beginning to the end.Where the equally brilliant but fictional series 'The Wire' took the topic of crime as a means to cast a look at all aspects and social layers of a whole city (Baltimore), 'O.J.: Made in America' examines the life and crimes of a single man (albeit one leading a very public life) to cast a very close look at American society as a whole, and the result is the most complete, in-depth analysis of the divided nation's collective psyche I have ever seen.The portrait that emerges is so fascinating and so revealing and educational (and I hate to admit: thrillingly entertaining) that I believe this should be recommended viewing in schools and colleges across the country. And if you think: ""Meh, I know that story, it's been all over the news - not interested"", think again. Trust me, you do not know this story (or better: these stories). And there's a big chance you'll understand a great deal more about America once you've finished watching this masterpiece.I know I'm dishing out superlatives here, but it's like director Ezra Edelman made the ultimate documentary - perhaps even the ultimate film. 'O.J.: Made in America' functions on so many levels; it's like watching a whole collection of films where the same protagonist inexplicably lives through a wide array of very different stories (which somehow STILL manage to end up as ONE cohesive tale). Just to give you an impression how rich this documentary is, I tried to count the stories and most dominant themes and found at least 10 (although you could probably find more): 1. There's the fascinating story of a poor kid from the ghetto rising through sheer will and enormous talent to become an American icon and superstar.2. There's a great - and uplifting - sport story (especially for Football fans) that is usually the material of Hollywood films.3. There's the very human drama of a genuine love story turning into an abusive relationship plagued by domestic violence.4.

" Loved the broad scope
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,9,"Nearly 8hours is a big time investment, but absolutely worth! The thoroughness of this work to me was both a big positive as a little negative. Positive in the way you get to know so much about the issue through such a big scope and negative mainly because of the repetitiveness of interview-scene-interview-scene etc. Depending on how much you know and how much more you would like to know about O.J. Simpson you might find this both interesting and tiring at times. The whole thing is packed with very interesting and personal background information and interviews to me all seemed relevant. I watched the whole thing over the course of 2-3 weeks and found it works out pretty well.Three overlapping themes are combined 1. The character OJ Simpson 2. History of race gap & role of the LAPD 3. reactions and influence of the public. Throughout the course of Made in America they combined in a way that showed the complexity of it all from different angles. The events are displayed chronologically and the three themes mentioned above neatly work together with the passing of events where focus on different themes change from time to time. Overall definitely glad I checked this out, if you are still considering your time investment in this one I would say go for it – but make sure you really want to because you are in for a long one. It is really unique and outstanding, I don't think you'll regret it."
" Quite possibly the best 30 for 30 documentary that ESPN has made.
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,10,"Clocking in at around 7 hours without commercials, this documentary traces the life of OJ Simpson from his days with USC to his time in prison and beyond. Released a few months after the critically acclaimed and award winning FX miniseries American Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson, this Oscar nominated documentary uses tons of archival footage and blends them with interviews and graphic photos to tell a story of a man whose fame was rottened by scandal and corruption. The music is well done and the pacing is quite good. When it was shown on ESPN, they had to edit the language and graphic material so that general audiences could enjoy it with their kids. I suggest you record this in its entirety whenever Viceland or one of the ESPN channels shows it, or buy it online to see it uncut."
" WOW One of the Best Movies (Not Just Docs) of the Year
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie, first seen on ESPN, is absolutely riveting. Told in 5 parts, which let me absorb each one (seeing all 7-1/2 hours at once would be tough) it's the story of what made OJ Simpson so great, how he changed our understanding of race and celebrity, the background of racial relations in Los Angeles and the US, his relationship with Nicole, the murder of Nicole and Ron Goldman, domestic violence, the pertinent parts of the Simpson trial, and the verdict and its aftermath. It gets better with each episode. I wish my young son could watch the whole thing, but Episode 4 is very graphic (homicide photos never before seen) and yet is the best-told episode. Fascinating storytelling. There is absolutely no doubt that this man committed two horrendous murders (if you don't think so, you're just not aware of the evidence) and this explains why against a very big picture of race, celebrity, and justice. Outstanding film. Really important film to understand our culture today."
" Great American Crime Saga
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,10,"This documentary explores the murder trial of O.J. Simpson - but it focuses not only on the lives of the people involved - but also the socio-political backdrop of Los Angeles. A city where the police acted as a militarized force against the black communities at a disparaging rate - and the courts seemed to protect the police and persecute the blacks. At the same time - to be rich in Los Angeles - was to be able to literally - get away with cold blooded murder. From out of this landscape - came the crime of the century. Where the beloved and wealthy O.J Simpson - a college football star, professional player, move star, and celebrity, was accused of a horrific homicide - taking a knife and butchering his wife and her friend. He would then lead the police on bizarre chase that was watched by millions of Americans. He was even cheered on by thousands of people who waited on the road to watch him pass by.After his arrest came the trial of the century - a tale that not even Shakespeare could have written. The trial would be broadcast live and watched by millions of people around the world. It was one of the biggest events in history. The defense was made up of a team of specialists who were paid fifty thousand dollars a day to poke holes in the prosecutors case - and boy did they ever! Racist cops. Allegedly planted evidence. Murder gloves that do not fit.But what makes this more interesting - is that despite the defense theories - the evidence against O.J Simpson was overwhelming. He was home at the time of the murders. He had a history of severe domestic abuse. Stalking. He had cuts on his hands from a knife that he could not explain. There was simply no one else with the means, motive, and opportunity to murder these people. Yet - the jury acquitted him after only three hours of deliberation! The jurors were made up of nine black women. The DA had decided to keep the trial in downtown Los Angeles so it would seem to be a more balanced prosecution. But the jury would later admit that O.J Simpson was acquitted because they wanted revenge on the city of Los Angeles for the mistreatment of the black community at the hands of the police department. After the footage the documentary shows - it is difficult not to sympathize with the jurors plight. Their community was under siege. They retaliated. Even more astonishing - was that OJ Simpson had never been a defender of the black community. In fact, he had distanced himself from the black community almost all of his life. Yet they protected him - and to the black community it was a sign of progress for a black person who be acquitted in a court of law - even if they were guilty. Perhaps that is a racial quagmire that I - and all other white people - should fathom - before we pass judgment? OJ Simpson would be found not guilty, but his crimes would haunt him for the rest of his days. His friends distanced themselves. He lost much of his fortune. He was even found liable in a civil trial of the murders. His life imploded into drugs, alcohol, and buffoonery. He ran with a crew of misfits and losers and scumbags and con artists. Finally - he would commit a stupid armed robbery to get some of his old memorabilia back and he would at last be sentenced to decades in prison. One cannot help but notice that all of America is on trial in this documentary - and that in a sense - justice was indeed done. The city of Los Angeles was punished for their crimes. O.J. Simpson was finally punished for his crimes. Perhaps there is no way to make sense out of all of this - except to learn from this story - and try not to repeat history? I should ad - this documentary is simply far more complex than any written review can explain. It had tremendous interviews with the colorful cast of characters involved. Footage of heartbreaking loss. Intense struggle. And even the heroic actions of the family of the murder victims - whose pursuit of justice would not go unanswered."
