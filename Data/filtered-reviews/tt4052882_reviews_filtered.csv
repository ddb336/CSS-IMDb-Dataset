" Utter rubbish
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,2,"This started ok, became far fetched towards the middle and turned into absolute nonsense in the end. She did what to the shark!? Yeah, right."
" If there's anything unrealistic is some viewers with their expectations...
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,7,"I think some of those 'critics' should take a good check of themselves... You are watching a 'pretend shark attack' thriller that is supposed to just give you some scare for some of those 90 minutes... It's not a bloody masterpiece, it's entertainment. Just drop your ratonal side and high expectation and enjoy the ride (or tide raher)! For me, proper thrill most of the time with beautiful Blake who steals the show."
" It works
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,"The shallows works for what it is, a survival/shark thriller. Great acting from Lively and a surprisingly well developed storyline. There are a few lulls but not too long and easily over looked. Keep expectations low and enjoy the heart pounding ride."
" Meh
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,5,"It has its moments, and it's certainly watchable, however The Shallows is mostly a forgettable and bland little Shark thriller with nothing very newor out of the box to deliver along the way. Perhaps one of the films greatest flaws was the first 20 minutes. Obviously it was needed for the sole purpose of making the film a needed length for theaters, but it's just shlock full of filler, unnecessary backstory, and a weird amount of commercial like shots. There are legit moments that I wondered how much these companies paid to get their advertising in this film, and so many slow-mo shots towards the beginning it began to be nauseating. As for the standard shark action portion of the plot, it has its intense moments, but I felt the most intense moments oddly didn't really involve the shark at all. Moments where she is doing stitches, and jellyfish and, other side events feel a lot more frightening than the CGI shark- and I'm sure that's not the point it was trying to make- but the film certainly would feel better as a lost at sea movie rather than a shark movie. Lively is fine in her role, her dialogue is written horribly, but she gives her emotional scenes with such strength you will forgive her by the end. Sully Seagull is also an animal actor as the seagull in the film, and honestly, my favorite part, ause that bird is adorable. In conclusion, I will not remember The Shallows in the long run. In terms of shark films, it's not as bad as 47 Meters Down but nowhere near as good as Jaws . Is it bad per say, no, but it's not anything remarkable either.
My Rating: 5/10"
" Stupid unrealistic
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,2,"A shark that turns into a stalker and just kills for the fun of it. Even if he just made a kill and could be feasting for hours he would rather immediately go for another kill., come on... like no lessons learned at all since Jaws."
" Good survival movie..!!
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,8,"A girl go for surfing to a see shore and when she started surffing suddenly his surf pad broken by shark..then she was stand on rock which is situated in sea but at evening the sea covers that rock soo she tries to escape from that deadly shark..
Good survival thriller movie..
There is no boring and same visuval..
Must watch movie..!!"
" good survival in nature thriller
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,8,"I remember watching this in 2016 in low resolution, so decided to re watch on higher one. And it is just as good. About survival, being scared, skills, faith, hope, courage, fear, compassion. There are not too much people or things, but enough. The shark looks real, the probability looks bit unreal or too lucky, the shark's long presence in one spot in water and attack on large objects for so long time looks unreal to me. I expected I will see presence of more people in the end. Bit too lucky, too little things, and bit unrealistic. But looks real, detailed, nicely recorded. Just not enough content to be regarded as best movie. Looks like this is more about empathy and compassion and faith rather than survival. It motivates us to not be ignorant of others needing our help, and to have faith and not give up. Good motivation for medical students. Similar to many survival water movies like ones about sharks and pool accidents, none of which I currently remember unfortunately."
" One of the better shark films out there.
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,6,"Me and my wife have watched this film for the second time and it is a solid film, it is really a 6.5 overall. There are a few ""ok then"" scenes , but with shark genre you have to accept that true facts of their behaviour has to be bent some to make a good film. Would recommend if your running low on solids films"
" Loved her
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,10,She is beautiful a great actress.Special effects fabulous and the area and ocean beautiful.Thought where there were Dolphins sharks didn't go?
" In the realm of shark movies, this is closer to the top
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,8,"This film is shot extremely well, and gorgeous to watch. Lively acts very well, and the other ""bit"" players do a fairly average job. Overall, the idea is nothing new, but the ways that the main character navigates her situation are original and suspenseful. The thrills are good, it looks good. But for 2 major deviations in animal behavior, this film was very good. So with those 2 blips in the plot that we must accept to keep the movie going, this film scores an 8.
Compare this to other shark-attack movies and it's a 10. This was not a low-budget production. I would watch it again."
" Good Shark Movie!
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,"So this is a good shark movie, Blake Lively is basically the only main character with just a few others popping in here and there until they got eaten.Unlike a lot of shark movies with genetically altered, crazy ass vengeful sharks. This features a normal shark that does seem to get a bit Aggro on poor Blake. The story goes that while surfing she ends up getting to close to the big dead/alive whale and therefore invaded the sharks feeding grounds and causes it to chomp up a mexican drunkard as well as two fellow Mexican surfers. She survives it all thou and the movie does a good job of making us feel for Blake. All in all I gave it a 8 for being a more normal yet still entertaining shark movie with none of the usual craziness. I do wish thou that the shark fight at the end was a little longer maybe? It that we saw a bit more of the shark besides the fin or when it decided to hop out the water for a snack xD."
" Amazing underwater graphics and detail!! Great movie!
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,"Ok I am not sure how this movie got such low ratings. I am usually not amazed by shark movies at all but I decided to give this one a shot because my husband and I had a group of over 10 people who wanted to watch it at movie night. The underwater graphics and sound effects are AMAZZZING! You really feel the main character's (Blake Lively) emotion and hurt under water. The graphics and also very beautiful and detailed. Not to mention the shark in the film, even though not a real shark, the real-like graphics were beyond out of this world. This movie gave me a sort of relaxing feeling, which sounds weird but the scenery was just to die for, but still gave me an off-my seat action packed thriller,. I mean the way the shark comes after her so furiously is intense! Loved this film. Don't listen to the lame reviews. Give it a shot its worth it!"
" The Shallows could have been so much better
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,5,"The Shallows is a movie with a good premise and suspenseful action. As a movie, it is worth a watch. But be prepared to leave realism behind after a while.A woman named Nancy, played by Black Lively, finds herself stranded on a rock after being bitten by a shark. The shark, like the movie's realism, is over the top. It is not a small shark. And it wants what it came for even though you would think it would be full. But whatever, I could at least understand the shark having elements to it that were over the top. The plot line is a different story.At first Nancy devises completely realistic and intelligent ways to stay away from the shark long enough to try and survive. But then the movie thinks it needs that spectacular action finish where the split second ideas are so fantastic as to be completely unbelievable. Nancy can see things really well too.This movie had a great opportunity to be more realistic and yet still suspenseful. But it chose shallow Hollywood action over great story and because of that, whatever story was left at the end I did not care about. The Shallows is a one time watch movie."
" Very well done
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,7,"Great suspense, lovable actors and good plot and the way it was set up.
And no, this is not a discovery channel documentary about sharks.
Just sit back, relax and enjoy a good popcorn movie..."
" Tense, taut and lots of fun. A real summer surprise!
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,7,"Let's not kid ourselves, Blake Lively is not a great actress. She will NEVER be a great actress. But if you need a young, blonde, all-American, physically fit actress, Blake Lively will fit the bill. She exudes health and vitality. It's easy to believe that she would be up to tough physical tasks. She's friendly and expressive.So she has found perhaps the perfect role for her talents with the gripping THE SHALLOWS. She's called upon to play an American surfer who has come to an obscure beach in Mexico do enjoy the very waters her mother remembered so fondly. She chats amiably with her driver, then arrives at beach. She is filmed somewhat lingeringly getting changed into her surfing gear, and then she has some fun with a couple of local surfers. The scenery is gorgeous. The people are gorgeous. It's all wonderfully tranquil. Until, suddenly, it isn't. Lively, late in the day and now all alone, is attacked by a huge shark. The movie is now one of survival, man-against-nature.The film clocks in at a crisp 87 minutes. It tells just enough story, for the most part, and nothing more. Lively's adventures, while certainly quite unlikely, have just enough credibility to draw the viewer in. There are brief moments of humor (the film features a wonderful seagull!), and plenty of moments of terror. If the ending is a bit of stretch (and the coda that follows it a bit ham-fisted), my feeling upon leaving the theater was of having been well and professionally entertained. It's not quite a horror film, nor is it an existential crisis film (like ALL IS LOST, Robert Redford's excellent film). It follows a competent, determined but fearful character that we like as she tries to figure out a way past her deadly dilemma.There are a few flaws, of course. These vary from unavoidable (a few of the CGI effects are not great, no doubt due to the film's tiny budget) to unneeded (sorry, but I just don't buy Lively as doctor-in-training...and the script didn't have to make her one). A few times the shark perhaps acts with more intelligence than it should (despite what JAWS: THE REVENGE suggested 30 years ago...sharks don't carry grudges). And the ending feels a bit tacked-on and unneeded. We've spent nearly the entire film alone with Lively. We should have been able to end it that way too.But these are minor annoyances. If you want some heart-pounding fun, set in a gorgeous location (with some beautiful views from above) and prefer to get your frights without supernatural elements, THE SHALLOWS is highly recommended. This film came somewhat out of nowhere...but it is well worth discovering."
" Nature wants to eat you
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,8,"I didn't expect to like this movie - just occupying time during Covid-19. But I really did. This goes beyond Jaws, with real art. It surprises me to see all the very bad reviews. Yes, you have to suspend some disbelief, like the pathological behaviour of the shark. A few improbable fortuitous things like the flare gun. I'm okay with that. Movies do that. But what hooked me, aside from Blake Lively's undeniable attractiveness - no spoiler there! - was the basic premise. Stuck on a rock tantalizingly close to shore, surrounded by death. Man against nature, and nature simply wants to eat you. Literally everything around her is dangerous: the shark, of course. The sun and cold. The jellyfish and coral. The rocks and the sea. To say nothing of her very serious injury. I guess the steady source of fresh blood explains the unrelenting attraction of the shark. In this hopeless setting, with hardly more than her bikini, Blake Lively fights back. And what a fight! Far-fetched at times, to be sure, but they made it believable.There were some really notable moments. Great beach and great surfing. The GoPro. The weird luminescence of the jellyfish. Most shocking, of course, was the ""sutures"", a truly memorable scene! Not far behind that is the whale carcass. Picture the dismay of suddenly realizing you are in the water with that. You want nothing more than to be far from it, yet moments later you are clinging to it for dear life.So it was a fun watch and a memorable movie. Raw, beautiful, shocking, and intense. I respect a director who can make something so watchable when so much of the movie is one character on a rock.I definitely recommend The Shallows."
" Another log-like performance from a talentless actress
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,5,Rarely has an actor had a more misleading name than Blake Lively. She should change her name to Blake Wood. I hope the shark wins
" Unrealistic, but Entertaining. Blake Lively Rocks her Role
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,8,"The only reason this movie is great, Blake Lively. There are very little lines in the film, not a ton of action or things for Blake to do, but somehow with her facial expressions of fear and terror along with her strength and will to live brings the movie to life. I loved the filming of the beach and water and that most of the movie was not CGI making it feel more real. Some of the shark scenes were bad CGI, but only a few. Most of the movie does not make logical sense. Such as the sharks bite being more deadly for some people and not for others. Or how the shark seems to keep getting bigger. Or how the shark can jump and do crazy things, but other times cant. There aren't very many good shark movies out there, its hard to be picky when watching one, even though The Shallows is flawed I enjoyed the film a lot."
" If anyone deserved to be eaten by a shark.
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,2,"I actually had to cover my eyes during parts of this movie. It was so cheesy I couldn't stand it. They go through extreme lengths to make you feel like she's just the nicest person there could possibly be and she's the last beautiful soaking wet white woman in a bikini you would ever want to be eaten by a shark. It was layed on so heavy that I wanted her to be eaten by a shark before she even hit the water, but the scene with the sea gull sealed the deal for me. It was a bad movie and not the good kind of bad movie."
" So Much Em-Ocean!
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,"The Shallows is a cinematic masterpiece that will have you on the edge of your seat. Blake Lively plays a girl named Nancy, who is stranded on a rock in the middle of the ocean in this human vs. shark thriller. Lively's acting is quite admirable, I could feel her despair and loneliness through the screen. Not only is the acting fantastic, but the amount of stress is addicting. I enjoyed the feeling of not knowing, and the need to survive. This film presented an adventure that one can only enjoy by watching this motion picture."
" Blake, bikini, shark... Enough said
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,7,"It seems that everyone who has watched six minutes of shark week is a qualified arm-chair expert on shark behavior when it comes to crying down this gem of a movie... The main complaint seems to be that sharks don't ""stalk"" people, followed by a suggestion that Jaws is a far more realistic and an immeasurably better movie (in which the shark indeed stalked people... who were even in a boat... albeit much too SMALL a boat...) Perhaps these folks also think Sharknado is a more realistic movie too...
Now I'm no expert (even living on a Caribbean island and spending half my life in their back-yard), but I have learned a few things about wild animals, not the least of which is that now matter how much we learn about their behavioral patterns... They always have a surprise or two in their repertoire.
Oh Ryan old chum, you certainly landed yourself a beautiful and talented wife and mother to your three kids (though the bikini strongly suggests you guys adopted all of 'em...)
Blake Lively had a Herculean task here, and carried it through with the prowess and credibility of a far more seasoned actor. It can't be easy to flex one's thespian chops whilst sitting on a rock in the blazing sun in nothing but essentially underpants, facing seemingly insurmountable odds, and with no-one to talk to who can actually talk back... Just ask Tom Hanks.
I would have enjoyed this movie if Blake had just sat on the rock in her bikini reading the phonebook the whole time...
The Scenery is breathtaking, and the way they trained that shark to do all those tricks and stunts is awe inspiring... Mad props also to Steven Seagull and the whale for their quietly supportive roles... The animal wranglers had their work cut out...
All-in-all, anyone who says this movie is a waste of time obviously works as an international person-of-mystery or a Starfleet captain and has much more interesting things to do than I...
Oh, and for all the experts out there, if you pause some of the drone shots and use your slide rule to compare Blake ( at 5' 10"" of feminine perfection) and the shark, you will find, as I did, that at scale the shark is somewhere between 22-25 feet nose-to-tail, making a solid argument that it is female also... Proving that it is possible to make a very engaging and exciting action movie with not one but TWO female lead characters, without shoving a feminist agenda down everyone's throats... It's called acting."
" The best movie!
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,10,This movie is one of my favorites :) Exciting and I wasn't bored for a minute! I LOVE so much!
" Sully Seagull WOW
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,6,Animal actor Sully Seagull really stole the show!! Should have got best supporting actor Oscar nomination at the very least!!
" Gripping most of the way.
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,7,"Minimalist storytelling gets a workout here, as we follow one character in a spooky life-or-death situation. Blake Lively is Nancy, a surfer who ventures to a secluded beach once favoured by her (deceased) mom. It isn't long before she realizes that the waters are the feeding ground of a particularly relentless great white shark. For much of the running time, Nancy is stranded on a rock outcropping roughly 200 yards from shore. She will have to save her own butt since help will prove to be a very hard thing to come by.Written by Anthony Jaswinski, and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (the director of ""Orphan"" and the ""House of Wax"" remake), this is generally entertaining stuff. Lively is good enough an actress to have us rooting for her throughout, and wincing when she has to tend to her wounds. (Conveniently, the character has medical training, and the means to do an impromptu job of sewing.) Lively is the main reason to watch, as she fights and fights mightily to survive. Although Collet-Serra is able to deliver some tension and thrills, it's Lively that helps the movie through its sillier and more unbelievable moments (such as the ultimate means of dispatching the beast).The minimum of locations used creates a very intimate feel, there's a rather endearing (and obviously well-trained) seagull that hangs around and becomes something of a companion for Nancy, the music is appropriate, and the picture is very well shot in widescreen by Flavio Martinez Labiano. The pacing is fine, resulting in a movie a few minutes shy of an hour and a half. The mostly digital effects are tolerable.While a far cry from the masterwork that was ""Jaws"", the high water mark for the entire shark film genre, this has certainly got to rank as better than some of the ultra-cheesy finned predator cinema that is out there.Seven out of 10."
" Fairly enjoyable
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,6,I find this film fairly enjoyable even the slow start. The plot can get a bit iffy with the holes like the fact she surfing with a dead whale near by. Even so it did keep my interest overall.
" Not bad after all, but size does matter..
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,7,"You might find it as a cliche to all other shark survival movies, but it carries well on the audience.
Of course the habit of making the size of the shark vastly exaggerated to woe the audience continues to be the center of such movies. A 14-footer would do same damage and is equally terrifying."
" Fair enough !
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,6,Beautiful shots of the ocean with the beautiful Blake in a survival story ! She fits the role perfectly and did everything she could . it's not the best survival movie but it's good enough !
" Not Bad
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,7,"I liked this movie a lot actually. It was basically only in one location. I love survival movies like this. Taken place at one location, a bit claustrophobic. It's pretty good. Eerie and you really feel for it. Sharks are scary.Worth a watch7 stars"
" Shark is realistic & plenty of jump scares. Good shark movie.
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,8,"Is this movie perfect? No. Is it cringey at times? Perhaps. But as far as shark movies go, it's one of the better ones.Would a shark rather eat a human over a full bodied whale carcass? No. Thats a flaw. But the hook in the sharks mouth eludes to its hatred of humans. Hence it stalks her!"
" Suspensful shark movie
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,8,"The Shallows is light on story, but more than makes up for this with great suspensful set pieces, and a good lead acting role by Blake Lively, ably supported by Steven Seagal 😉.
Lively's character is stranded on a small island with an injured seagull,after being attacked by a killer shark, and has to make it to the shore line before the tide comes in.
The movie has some great shark attacks, jump scares, and just enough blood to make this one of the better shark movies out there.
But it still ain't no Jaws!"
" Shark kills
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,6,Blake lively was good in this and the shark was realistic looking.It's not the best shark movie and it's not the worst but you will find it entertaining
" Dumb slasher film that kind of works in a strange way
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,6,"I think one of the struggles that modern shark movies have is that we know so much more about this breed of fish at this point. There is an entire week on one cable network every year that is entirely devoted to the exploration of sharks. Jaws was the progenitor of this genre so it gets a pass. It seems that Jaws lit a fire under the entire world to know more about sharks, but now that we do, it's hard to buy into a movie where a shark is behaving like an insane serial killer. The Shallows attempts to throw an explanation at the audience in the laziest way possible, and I think it's actually worse for even trying. But if you abandon all reason, and just accept that in a movie it can make sense for an angry shark to hover around one spot in order to hopefully murder a young surfer who has been stranded in the water, then perhaps you can enjoy this film. I'd say, even though The Shallows has the tone of a more serious film, you need to approach it like a slasher horror movie, and see Blake Lively as your prototypical ""final girl.""I was surprised how much tension I actually felt for Blake Lively in this film. They do a nice job of putting her in a no-win scenario, and placing her at the mercy of the serial-killer shark. I thought the effects were surprisingly good, and she was excellent at portraying the pain from her wounds. However, I did feel that later they glossed over a lot of the pain and suffering for the sake of convenience. I recognize that adrenaline can empower people to do unbelievable things, but it seems utterly ridiculous that this character is able to swim with her normal efficiency despite starving, heat exhaustion, traumatic injuries, and severe loss of blood. Thankfully, I found a way to connect with the character, which allowed my brain to ignore some of the red lights that were coming up when the movie defied logic. There's something compelling about one woman's battle against an evil force that is trying to kill her, and it makes The Shallows more entertaining than it would be otherwise. There were actually moments that I held my breath in fear while watching it, which I think is a great sign."
" The shallows
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,8,"The movie is very particular in setting up perimeters and rules. And making it as believable as possible, that in a modern time like this, someone would not be able to call for help (apart from the usual ""no service"" kind of cheat other movies do when it comes to Cell Phones). And if you buy into it, it works.There's also the question why Livelys character goes there in the first place. Well even that is explained, so there is no doubt about motive too. What never is explained though, is not where the Shark came from or why it got there, but how it's possible that it's so bloodthirsty! We're talking Jason Vorhees or any other Slasher movie kind of mad. Maybe even more mad than that.And while you could easily go, well it's a movie, it kind of breaks it's own rules there. Because everything seems logical (explaining mentioned), even the character and her ability to deal with (graphic) wounds ... but not the shark, who is really a monster if you come to think of it. But if you don't care about internal logic, like the view (no pun intended) and the thrill of it, you will have a good (scary) time watching this!"
" The Shallows - Cinematography

The lady struggles a lot to cross the sea water from shark fish,

Budget $17-25M; box office $119M.Sharks in real life never behave the way they do in the movies - this is the lesson I just suddenly realized.I have always been fascinated by great white sharks and have always liked Hollywood movies about them. However, after watching this movie and doing research about real shark behavior, I came to the sudden realization that maybe I should not watch shark movies any longer since sharks in real life NEVER behave the way they behave ALL the shark movies.""6 Shark Attack Myths from 'The Shallows'"". I just read that article about this movie on National Geographic; it is a good read. Everything I thought I knew about sharks has been dispelled by that article.Incessant stalking and ""terminator""-like haunting behavior - this is pretty much seen in ALL shark movies including this one, Jaws 1-3, Deep Blue Sea 1 & 2, 47 Meters Down 2017 & 2019, The Reef, Una Noche (2012), which are all movies I have seen and can attest to this. This is in ALL shark movies and yet turns out this is a myth. Even the smelling of blood from a long distance is also a myth.This film did not take into account REAL shark behavior just like all the other science-fiction shark films and even threw out the window the diving decompression science.The outcome of the shark in this film was also very science-fiction.
The plot's introduction was very poorly written. Later we find out why she is at the beach, but that should have been mentioned at the introduction.And yes, the ""big dead fish"" was also not smart for the plot.On a positive note, I did like the camera angles. I also really liked the slow-motion approach to some of the scenes.""Bird set free"" by Sia - this was a nice ending song.However, despite the film's total abandonment for REALITY and SCIENCE, overall it was a cool movie. it had nice beach clips, nice cinematography, and the CGI was fine. Blake Lively did well to carry the film with her acting single-handedly. The ending was good. And I loved that seagull <3"
" Entertaining
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,7,Normal story with good screen presence if you are bored you can watch this movie
" The only shark film since Jaws
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,10,Honestly this story holds up to jaws quite well by introducing a new take. their will always be some amount of unrealism to these stories because honestly in real life it either happens quick or not at all. With that in mind enjoy one of the only 2 must see shark films.
" Unnecessary yet Entertaining
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,6,The Shallows is not at all a necessary film nor is it a piece of work that adds anything to the shark attack genre. There is little characterization and plot in the 1 hr and 26 minute run time but then again there is something refreshing about a no-strings attached minimalistic thriller with summer vibes that makes this film passable.
" Deeper than just average shark movie
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,9,"While other shark movie focus on it's horror. The shallow focused on the human will to survive, to fight till as much as we can.Nancy has just lost her mother, might be because of cancer as if her hair fall of in the scene. This loss made her wonder about her life as medical student and she decided to take a break and went to the beach her mother once visited when she was pregnant. As far as we go to the character, seems that Nancy would give up her career in medical faculty as she says to her father ""Why try so hard if the results are the same?"". Might be because of the pain and suffering from the chemotherapy worsens her quality of life. Nancy might thought that if her mother would die anyway, why don't just take the palliative care, more fight means more suffering.Things change when the shark hit her. She know she wants to life, she wants to meet her family again. Suddenly fighting is not just for yourselt, but for the people you loved.Blaked Lively acted well and we can feel her determinated will to survive, not just in this shark attack but in her live afterhat."
" Has issues, but not too bad.
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,6,"Right, this film was hit and miss. But overall it's not too bad.The suspense was there pretty quickly and it really does keep you on the edge of your seat, so for that I have to give huge credit. Acting from Blake Lively as well you can't knock in my opinion either.My issues: SPOILERS includedSo my biggest issue was the ending. She attaches herself to a chain and shoots down towards some spikes, shark goes after, she dodged and shark dies. So throughout the film it's shot really well and realistic. But the ending felt so unserious, bit like a b movie rather than a serious film. And it really put me off.I didn't understand why the shark was circling her for days, especially when there was a huge dead whale about 100ft away. It even hits the whale to get her off. I dunno, it was just something that bothered me, because surely this would never happen.If the ending changed though I don't think the above would have really bothered me. At the end of the day, there's only so much you can do about a woman being stuck on a rock in the sea. So I give props for what they made, but the above annoyed me and took it from a 7/10 to a 6/10. Overall, it's not a bad watch. Few annoyances, but I enjoyed my time."
" If you can excuse Jaws for being unrealistic, why not The Shallows?
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,8,"The Shallows is a REALLY well constructed thriller. Blake Lively gives a good performance and the film does a great job of maintaining a sense of dread throughout.With all of that said, I keep seeing people say ""It's not realistic"" but then praising Jaws. Jaws is no doubt an amazing movie, but it is not at all realistic. A shark sticking around one beach and then continually stalking a single boat for multiple days?? How is that acceptable but a shark stalking a continuously bleeding woman stuck on a rock for around a day is too much? Some of you are serious hypocrites."
" Will of living...
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,4,"""The Shallows"" is a Drama - Horror movie in which we watch a surfer who is attacked by a white shark trying her best to survive with everything she has.I believe that every shark movie is very difficult to overcome the barrier of the movie ""Jaws"" and what it started. Nevertheless ""The Shallows"" is an average Horror movie that presents very well what a person has to go through in order to survive not only physically but mentally as well. The interpretation of Blake Lively who played as Nancy was good but not the best in order to save this movie. Finally, I have to say that ""The Shallows"" is another average but entertaining horror movie to spend your time."
" Speechless Really
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,2,"Really didn't expect that the whole film would be a girl siting on a rock, watching people getting eaten around her, whilst she got off with a bitten legPure unadulterated rubbish. God knows who commissions this stuff"
" A pretty enjoyable shark movie with some tone and plot issues
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,7,"Jaws was one of the most popular shark movies ever made and no movies after that have quite captured the feel of that movie. A lot of directors try to add their spin to it but it never quite worked like Jaws, not even the sequels to Jaws. The Shallows was a movie that I feel ""almost"" captures it.The movie has a simple premise in that a medical student, Nancy Adams (Blake Lively), who is suffering from the loss of her mother is attacked by a great white shark while surfing and left stranded on a small land of rock. Left injured and stranded 200 yards from shore, Nancy must fight for her life as the deadly predator circles her in its feeding ground.The thing to note is that this movie is a one-woman show. Blake Lively shines as the main lead Nancy and she has to considering the movie is mostly 80 minutes of her fighting a CGI shark. She gives such a powerful and believable performance that shows the struggle her character is going through. Every scream, cries and gasp for the air of Nancy feels very real and this was only successful due to the amazing performance of Blake Lively. There is some supporting cast but they are either shark bait or really just there to give exposition or some backstory to Nancy. One standout supporting cast has got to be the seagull that Nancy befriends named Steven Seagull. A lot of disaster movies has a dog that the audience doesn't want to die and in this case, it's Steven Seagull.I also really enjoy the movie when Nancy was stuck on that rock. It was incredibly tense and very suspenseful. Every time the character has to step off the rock it is honestly some of the most nail gripping and high tension-building moments ever. These moments are slow burners and not high octane intense moments where she is getting attack every couple of minutes but it feels way more entertaining that way. However, during the third act, the movie does become a high octane shark attack movie that becomes borderline ridiculous and kind of silly albeit slightly entertaining.I also really appreciate the one location this movie is set in which is visually stunning and beautiful but made for the film as hell for our character and the audience.While I do like the movie when she is finally on the rock, the build-up from before is such a drag especially considering this movie is only 87 minutes long. The beginning also tries to set up some sort of plot point with Nancy not being sure if she wants to be a doctor anymore due to her mother's death. She asks a lot other supporting characters concerning this but then it is dropped when the shark attack happens and is never referred to again. It just feels like pointless padding and it didn't make me more invested in her character in any way.There are also some weird choices such as the music/score and editing. The beginning and last part of the movie has some really strange music choice with pop songs that honestly made me question if I was watching a 90's music video or something. It ruins the serious nature and creates a conflict of tone within the movie. The score during the shark attacks becomes more of what I expected but not exactly memorable either. There is also a lot of slow-mo in the movie that just feels really out of place and unnecessary. It feels like parts of this movie is a modern take and some feel like it is in the 90s.The CGI shark is generally all right and feels real for the most part. However, during the third act, it becomes notably worse and some non-CGI Sharks are also quite bad to look at and kind of took me out of the film sometimes. There is literally a slow-mo scene where a CGI object is flying towards the screen and it was laughably bad.Overall, despite this movie never really reaching the level of Jaws, it does feel like a relatively competent and entertaining movie. It has a lot of good in it that on first viewing you will definitely come out having a thoroughly enjoyable time with it."
" My second favourite shark movie of all time!
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Aside from the original Jaws which will always remain the greatest shark movie in history, the shallows easily comes in second, it's better than all the others, the jaws sequels, 47 meters down, the Reef all of them! A great movie with some real tense scenes!!"
" shark wanted to eat the girl....
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,3,Why would a shark come after you when literally there is a beautiful fresh whale to eat???
" It's great
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,8,"One of the best shark movies I have ever seen, considering they are all bad. This one is actually good, probably because Blake Lively is a great actress"
" This movie can compete with Sharknado in stupidity
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,2,"Since jaws manny shark movies has been made and only a few were worth watching , like deep blue sea. This sure isn't one of them.Maybe if you like arty flashy camerawork and loads of unnecessary bikini shots , then you will give this movie a few stars. The story is just ridiculous. And the acting of the main actress was so bad that the star of the movie is a bird."
" Woof!
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,1,This movie is an insult to sharks all over the world.I want my 86 minutes back.
" Great movie
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,Very underrated I'm huge fan of shark movies and this is one the best I've seen by far dont judge it till you see it
" This movie is so good
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,Good movie. I dont understand why a lot of bad comments. Just watch and you will like it
" Actually pretty good!
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,9,It was pretty solid script and a lovable bird. The shark looked a bit weird but all in all it was an enjoyable movie with a realistic enough story. Would watch again without problem.
" A gem of a movie which shows really how to make a good exciting movie
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,10,"I respect all reviews here and of course everyone has their own opinion which is what reviews are all about. I won't decry anyone's review but I will post my own opinion. I loved this movie, I did not want it to end. One review said it's the best shark movie since jaws and I think that is a fair comment. I am planning to watch it for a second time this week even though I know what happens. With all the cheap horror genre movies being thrown out almost on a weekly basis it's nice to see a good movie well acted, well shot and your never looking at your watch. Well done to all involved in THE SHALLOWS excellent work."
" A DECENT SHARK THRILLER
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this suspenseful Shark Thriller but i love the killer Shark Genre anyway but this is a well made & well crafted survival Thriller with a good solid lead performance from Blake lively.
Blake plays Nancy, a troubled by grief, girl who has travelled to a remote & secluded beach for some alone time while surfing but gets hunted by a huge Great white shark & begins a game of survival to get back to shore as she's stranded on a big rock about 200 yards from the shore.
This is a well made & good looking movie & a terrifying looking Shark, even though it's a computer effect it still looks Amazing. I love the suspense of this film & the beautiful summertime beach scenery & i liked how Nancy has to keep out smarting the ultimately predator & things get very intense with scary scenes like Nancy climbing on top of a dead floating whale while the shark bangs into it trying to knock her off & some really beautiful scenes like the Jelly fish bit & many edge of the seat scenes with close calls with that terrifying creature.
All in all this is a good time popcorn flick, a summertime evening survival Thriller with a big scary Shark, good fun."
" A true horror movie, but some major flaws of logic
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,6,"Despite the numerous plot holes, I found The Shallows to be one of the more frightening movies I've seen in recent years. Some scenes are brilliantly done and I was very impressed with the CGI and makeup. Blake Lively is a decent choice in the lead role and, although she can be a bit corny at times, I felt she gave a very believable performance.The setting is beautiful and the film is wonderfully shot. I wasn't much of a fan of the inserted modern tech graphics however; it just seems like they cheapen the production value and will cause the film to become dated quicker. I also didn't care for the backstory; it was unnecessary and highly unoriginal. There is enough substance here to do away with backstory altogether. The final downside was the over-the-top ending, which was also unnecessary and corny. It would have been fine to just have her rescued after a few days of battling to stay alive.I felt like this was close to being a masterpiece but was let down by some errors in the writing. It would have worked perfectly as minimalist realism but was injected with superfluous distractions that heavily detracted from the authenticity of the movie. Still a highly entertaining watch though, just as long as you're not planning to go in the ocean anytime soon."
" Very entertained fight to the end
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,8,"Was a good film a bad situation to be in and be pushed to the brink of death, well written film watch if you like tense films ... enjoy 🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈"
" Very tense, gets ridiculous towards the end
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,7,"Very tense movie, keeps my on the edge of my seat though the final 20mins went from kind of realistic to just really over the top cheese. Still fun n worth the watch at like 1hr20mins or less total time."
" It's not a nature film...
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,8,...it's a beautiful surfer girl versus a fake shark. Blake Lively makes it work because she's totally committed to the preposterous premise. It's a fun movie!
" I liked it but..
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,6,"I liked this movie cause in general i love survival stories
I just have one objection :(
They made this shark an evil creature
It wants to revenge, it's evil kill people even when it's not hungry even if people don't hurt it which isn't true sharks don't do that
It's just stereotypical villain that has no real motivation"
" Surfer gal versus shark
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Surfer and medical school dropout Nancy (a strong and sympathetic portrayal by Blake Lively) finds herself stranded in the ocean with a hungry and relentless great white shark. She's 200 yards from the shore of a secluded beach and has no one but herself to rely on.Director Jaume Collet-Serra relates the tight and gripping story at a constant pace, stages the harrowing shark attack scenes with ferocious flair, and generates a tremendous amount of nerve-ratting tension. More importantly, Collet-Serra, screenwriter Anthony Jaswinski, and Lively all do an ace job of making Nancy a character who the viewer truly cares about as she uses a mixture of wits, strength, and courage to figure out a way to surmount her seemingly impossible situation. Flavio Martinez Labiano's sumptuous widescreen cinematography not only astutely captures the awesome beauty and danger of nature (the aerial shots of the beach are especially breathtaking), but also vividly depicts the sheer raw and brutal desperation of Nancy's terrifying predicament. Extras kudos are in order for the adorable seagull that becomes Nancy's fellow companion in peril. Granted, things get more than a tad absurd towards the end and the CGI shark looks a bit hokey at times, but overall it's an extremely intense and effective little nail-biter."
" Enter the Shallows If You Dare...
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,8,"The Shallows arrives just in time to erase the disappointing and underwhelming memory of Open Water, The Reef, and other shark pretender films. What those attempts lacked, The Shallows wields and flaunts... The missing link, or so to speak. There is a deep sense of isolation Blake Lively's Nancy experiences, which effortlessly transfers to the audience.The film places Lively, two surfers, and a tequila-affixed slob pitted against a massive, monstrous, bloodthirsty Carcharodon carcharias on a hidden gem island in Mexico. Surfing isn't as safe as some may actually believe. You see, the miscalculation is on the plate (ahem) of the Homo sapiens, for the white pointer is merely being a territorial predator protecting the immediate realm of her kill. ""Beneath this glassy surface, a world of gliding monsters"" as Dr. Higgins states in Deep Blue Sea.The ever-expanding and impending dread of the great white's prowling (torment even) of Lively, and the slight sprinkle of exaggeration while maintaining some realistic paradigm shifts, is where the successful breadth of this script and direction lies. The result is a rematch of human tenacity, will, and innovation versus the White's power, speed, and ferociousness.It's a bloody, grande 'ole 87 minutes, so strap in and enjoy the red waves."
" Lots of hate out there, not here.
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,7,"So many consider it necessary for movies to reflect reality. Not me, I like to escape and immerse in the movies. This movie does that. I was surprisingly drawn in, Ms. Lively held my attention the entire time. Beautiful scenery, decent character portrayal. A bit Jaws 4 ""this time it's personal"" towards the end, it's only a movie, after all. Solid movie."
" It's different from others shark movie
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,10,It's like jaws and cast away combined together. Great plot and scenery
" For God's sake don't waste your time.
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,2,Do these people know what a shark is? Ok let's overlook her going surfing by herself. The shark has a whole whale to eat! He's not going to go chasing her. Or anyone else. This is just a step up from Sharknado. At least that one wasn't taking itself seriously. This movie has no excuse.
" Meh...
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,4,"I'm one to typically like survival type movies. Kill or be killed.
I did, however find it a little ridiculous that this one shark had it out for her the whole movie and that it could bite through a steel buoy is kinda ridiculous.
Visuals were great but I wasn't expecting another ""JAWS"" type movie."
" It would have been great if it was more believable
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,5,"Overall a watchable movie but flawed in so many ways. Many others have already pointed out the numerous and overwhelming flaws so I won't embellish them much.
Obviously sex sells which is why the heroine is wearing a tiny bikini. In a secluded, unnamed beach. In Mexico. All alone. And no one in her family knew where she was. Makes sense to me if you realize this is a voyeur movie showcasing the surfer's attribute with a shark thrown in for excitement.
When the driver delivering her to the beach asked how she was going to leave at the end of the day, she said ""Uber""! Yeah, right! Uber in a secluded beach which name you do not know.
Anyway, a typical Hollywood movie which makes no sense, so just enjoy it for what it is."
" Oh no they didn't
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,6,"As far as it goes this is a good way to waste a couple of hours. Some good action, some very tense moments, lots of blood. Most of the blood is Ms Lively's but hey, it's her show. Not a horror in any real sense, too much of the horrific stuff was hinted at and not shown. This was a movie that engaged me right up until the end when the shark was killed. Looked like something out of SharkTales or Looney Toons, completely blew the whole suspension of disbelief and reminded me that this was just another movie. Lost its whole score at that point and only gained a 6 because the rest just about made up for it. The sharks death was where this movie ""jumped the shark""."
" Blake Lively gives a powerful performance in edge of your seat thrilling survival ride.
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,8,"Very underrated movie not just a ""Shark Movie"". It's another hit from a great director in Jaume Collet-Serra. A simple enough idea to work, yet too simple enough to be entirely memorable, The Shallows still made for a pretty good watch in it's own unique experience."
" Better than expected
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,7,"I thought Blake Lively was just another pretty face but she played a very credibly role as Nancy Adams in this movie. Was a bit apprehensive about how this movie would play out. How much of a movie can a director make of a surfer trying to escape a shark while stuck on a 4 by 5 inch island? The outcome is surprisingly good. As said good acting, great camera-work and solid scenario. Definitely recommend this movie. Two thumbs up!"

",2019-09-15 00:00:00,8,Finally I had guts to watch this shark movie. Nancy was such a great survivor. So proud of her. Felt bad for what happened to the shark in the end. He wasn't that smart. And you should've been more focus by not letting your anger got you.
" O-oh, digital shark attack!
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,5,"Without over-engineering things, let's roughly assume there exist four categories of shark movies. Steven Spielberg's 1975 hit ""Jaws"" forms a league of its own; - there's hardly any discussion there. The second category, admittedly a guilty-pleasure group of mine, contains all those delightful knock-offs of the late '70s and 80s, like ""Great White"", ""Mako: The Jaws of Death"", ""Tintorera!"", ""Cyclone"" and even the official ""Jaws"" sequels. I'll skip the third category for a moment and simply state clear - for the record - that the fourth and final category exclusively contains the numerous dim-witted and infuriatingly horrendous OTT shark-comedies (like ""Sharknado"", ""2-Headed Shark Attack"", ""Avalanche Sharks"", ""Sand Sharks"", ...)Coming back to the third category, this one contains, in my humble opinion the ""Yeah... but no"" efforts. I'm convinced these shark movies were made with the best of intentions, and most of them even are even enjoyable to watch, but none of them hold any potential to ever became great genre classics. There are plenty of titles here as well, like ""Shark Night"", ""The Reef"", ""The Meg"", ""Open Water"", ""Bait"", ""Dark Tide"", ""Red Water"", and I'm even willing to include ""Deep Blue See"" and ""Shark Attack"". Even though it received several good reviews and a relatively high score here on IMDb, ""The Shallows"" pretty much also sits in this category.""The Shallows"" is a so-called minimalist thriller, meaning it has a very small number of characters and a straightforward plot that can be summarized in one sentence. Nancy, a medicine student struggling with the choices for her future, has finally found the secluded Mexican beach where her beloved late mother went to surf. When night falls, she accidentally disturbs a great white shark during his whale carcass buffet and the massive animal promptly attacks her. With a severe leg injury, Nancy is trapped on a rock, barely 200 yards removed from a safe beach she cannot reach. Blake Lively's performance is forceful and director Jaume Collet-Serra (""Orphan"") establishes a handful of notably intense and atmospheric moments. Unfortunately, the entire production is rather, well, shallow itself. Nobody would ever doubt if Nancy survives the ordeal, whereas the Mexican surfer machos are guaranteed to become shark snacks. The predictability of the plot is still acceptable, but it's most regretful that every special effect (the shark, the whale, the jellyfish, ...) is computer engineered again."
" This movie was DOPE. Ignore the bad reviews!
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,10,"I was honestly surprised to come on here to see that the reviews for this movie were actually really not that good. I thought this movie was hands down dope as hell. This is probably the best shark movie to date that I've ever seen. (And I feel like I've pretty much seen all of them.) It's the perfect mix of thriller and shark horror and it definitely had me on the edge of my seat pretty much the whole time. Another good thing about it was it was perfectly timed. Not too short, not too long, with the perfect amount of content. Trust me, you'll be rooting for Blake Lively's character like your OWN life was on the line. Ten stars. Give it a watch and ignore the bad reviews :)"
" Suspense in its Purest Form
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,7,"While surfing from a remote Mexican beach a young woman named Nancy Adams is attacked by a shark. She manages to swim to an isolated rock about 200 yards offshore, but cannot make it back to the beach. To make matters worse, the rock is regularly submerged at high tide.And that, in a nutshell, is the plot of ""The Shallows"". This is essentially suspense film making in its purest, most simplified form. No subplots. No detailed character analysis or development. Little dialogue. One sole location (apart from the final scene). An adversary who has no complicated psychological motives, only blind killer instincts. This being a suspense thriller there have to be a few false hopes of rescue first raised and then dashed, otherwise the film would have been over in about half an hour.The nearest the plot comes to complexity is when it explains something of Nancy's back-story. We learn that she was a medical student but dropped out of medical school after being traumatised by the recent death of her mother. (Her medical training has some relevance to the plot as it explains how she is able to treat her own injuries). The reason why Nancy chose this particular beach is because her mother visited it while pregnant with her. We also learn that Nancy has a father and a younger sister, Chloe, back in Galveston, Texas.This is, of course, a one-woman film. Blake Lively who plays Nancy is on screen virtually the whole time; no other character plays anything like a major role. Well, no other human character. The second most important character is the shark itself and the third most important a seagull whom Nancy names ""Steven"". Steven Seagull (geddit?) is also injured by the shark and is the nearest thing Nancy has to a companion during her ordeal. I would agree with the critic who described Lively's performance as being ""as much an athletic feat as an aesthetic one"", as this is a film which depends upon its action sequences for its effect. Some people have described the efforts to provide Nancy with a back-story as unnecessary, on the grounds that in a battle between girl and shark the audience are always going to root for the girl even if she is an escaped convict rather than an aspiring doctor. I think, however, that the film-makers were right to provide their heroine with an identity and a life and thus establish her as an individual with whom we can identify rather than a mere plot device.In a sense the title of ""The Shallows"" is an apt one; there is little that is deep or significant about it, but then the film-makers never set out to make a deeply significant meaning-of-life movie. They set out to make a gripping thriller which would hold our attention for an hour-and-a-half, and in this we can say that they succeeded. 7/10A goof. The film is supposedly set in Mexico, but Steven Seagull is a silver gull, a species native to Australia and not found in Mexico. The reason is that, despite its ostensible setting, the film was shot on location in Australia."
" Sharks are moving closer to shores to find food
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,10,"Though these terrifying events are not specifically based on a true story it still feels all too real. Like a blend between #127Hours (based on a true story) and #Jaws (based on a book and real events). While preparing for her role, Blake Lively read and learned a lot about #Sharks and their/our environment. The director of the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History, George H. Burgess, linked increased shark attacks to the fact that rising temperatures force sharks to move closer to shores in an attempt to find comfortable water and food. Resulting in more attacks in shallow waters than in the deep ocean. Simple, realistic, terrifying and based on true events 'The Shallows' is the Best 'Shark Movie' since 'Jaws' (1975).9.5"
" Blake is Great
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,3,"Most of the time when people tell me that the acting is great but the movie is bad, I can't understand the difference. Check this movie out and it will all become crystal clear. There just isn't enough going on here to justify the runtime. None the less, Blake Lively does what she can with must have been just a blank page for the most part. If you're a fan of hers then you should check this movie out."
" Redeeming factor: Blake Lively is hot.
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,5,"What did I think of this movie? Hmmmm. The fact that some shark seems to have incredible intelligence and waits around for hours to consume one human, cleverly thinking up new ways to try and eat her was a bit to far fetched for me. Also, Blake Lively has a very MacGyver way of using her necklace to literally do everything. Also, how did the shark catch fire? I was also very confused by the method that Blake Lively used to kill said shark. How did she know that there was sharp rebar at the ocean surface, and that somehow being dragged to the bottom of the ocean by a heavy chain would result in her not drowning/getting eaten, but instead result in the shark impaling itself? I have SO MANY questions, and the movie was way too far fetched to be good..... yet I still somewhat enjoyed it. I think that can be totally attributed to the fact that I Blake Lively was in a skimpy bikini the entire movie and it was suspenseful. Good job Hollywood. You know what sells. Now take my money."

" I don't know why but loved it
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,10,"Not much to say actually, just a boring Sunday afternoon nothing to do and who knows why I choose this move to watch. It was perfect on a rainy day though. I never liked ""shark movies"" before but this one is pretty good.
Don't think it's an academy award film and expect more than a movie to watch once and forget it, but I wanted to give it 10."
" A waste of time
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,1,Honestly I can't add much more than the other reviewers. The sharks behaviour makes absolutely zero sense. There's no reason for it to remain in such shallow waters stalking the main character. He's quite literally there for the sake of plot. Honestly the premise of the movie just ruined it for me.
" Jawsbreaker
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,7,"There are more bad shark movies than I can possibly count, and I can count all the way to about 7 or 8. Jaws is obviously the gold standard of shark movies, but even that series, after the first (very underrated sequel) became a laughing stock. Since then we've had the ""just about passable"" fare of Deep Blue Sea and 47 Meters Down to the simply awful Meg and Sharknado. The Shallows quietly usurps all of these and manages to cut out a respectable corner in a horribly crowded sub-genre.Blake Lively is an adventure-seeking surfer taking a break from her med school studies to discover the secret Mexican (actually Australian) beach her late mother surfed at when pregnant with her. She's given a lift to this secret beach by a guy I was dead certain was Justin Long but it turns out that it's just a Spanish actor who looks exactly like him. Once in the water she immediately feels uncomfortable and is attacked by a Great White Haddock. The shore is only 200 yards away, and the water is only a few feet deep, but it's an impossible distance with an angry Great White circling in ever-diminishing diameters. Stranded on a tiny rock island, there is nowt to do but wait, scream for help, or take a million-to-one chance.Jaume Collet-Serra, who has carved a name for himself by directing half of Liam Neeson's recent filmography, wisely understands that less is more and that underplaying the suspense makes for a far more effective film that anything that indulges in overblown nonsense. He fills The Shallows with his usual visual trickery but it never feels out of place or overly stylish. There are some truly gorgeous shots here and some moments of tangible atmosphere, which is more than I can say about the majority of latter day studio features. Though the ""deep fake"" of the stunt double catching a tube, which Blake Lively was clearly unable to do, is a jarringly obvious effects-failure.For sure the winner of shark movies this decade. The Shallows is suspenseful and exciting, and, for someone who enjoys prolonged spells in tropical waters, quite nerve-wracking. Though, with a title like this, you'd think it was about modern-day females. It's 86 minutes of thrills and it's better than most movies twice that length."
" Beautiful beach, rediculous plot
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,3,Starts off promising but quickly becomes just another cheap and unrealistic and shark movie.
" Irresponsible, unbelievable, and pointless
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,3,"This ridiculous film ended up with me rooting for the shark, given that its habitat appeared to have been invaded by beings that don't belong there. An absolutely stupid denouement summed up the fact that after all the nonsense there was really nowhere for it (the film/the shark) to go. I'm not saying we shouldn't have thriller shark movies. But if we are going to misrepresent this wonderful species, then at least make good ones."
" I think in 2016 and onwards we should stop making movies like these
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,1,"A lone shark is the villain of this movie. As usual, the director apparently knows enough about sharks to see that they don't eat people but not enough to know that they also don't stalk humans, because they can smell/taste that the blood is different. Moreover - great whites don't beach themselves or swim in the waters as shallow as shown in this movie - they don't have the muscle power to extricate themselves if anything goes wrong nor the brainpower to predict the safest moment of venturing into DANGEROUS shallow waters - only mammals - like dolphins or orcas ( and of course human with its tendency to go everywhere it doesn't belong) do that.With 400000 - that is four hundred thousands sharks killed annually, to make pet food or whatever's the latest craze in environment-destroying cosmetics , the equivalent mass murder of human would look like 30 000 000 that is thirty million people killed annually by strange aliens who would follow them everywhere, dynamite cities willy-nilly to make structures of their own and be a general real-life horror.Not to mention that some European supermarkets offer shark as ""novelty meat"".The monsters are human. Leave the freaking sharks alone and stop making the movies about wolves, bears and other animals as villains.The sole villain, the sole monster in our biosphere room is HUMAN."
" It's A Sexy Jaws!
",2019-07-31 00:00:00,10,This movie was amazing! Blake was sooooo sexy and the shark was really freaky! I hope they keep making movies like this... keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time! Loved everything about it!
" A Great, very underrated Movie
",2019-07-31 00:00:00,10,"I just saw this recently on Netflix, and it has got to be one of the most underrated movies I have ever seen. First of all, the Cinematography combined with great Camera Work makes for one beautiful and visually stunning movie. The drone and underwater shots are simply gorgeous.Second, the story is actually pretty good, with nice background on the motivation of Blake Lively's character to go that place and the dynamics between her and her family members. Next is that the thrills and twists are really pretty good, and there's quite a number of them.Blake Lively herself gave a fantastic performance of a Medical Student trying to survive a Shark Attack. All these factors result in a great, highly entertaining movie. I know it did quite well in the Box Office, but I felt that it should've done much better owing to the quality the movie. A Must See for me."
" I watched this.......and then jaws1""and then was all better.
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,4,As this movie as lots of plot holes in it. that bloody sea gull. that bird had no meaning gulls dont do that they are stupid that would of swam of and got eaten. And the end when she held the chain and sank to the bottom she went deep water I'm surprised she didn't get the bends and die lol.
" Finish her!
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,1,Atrocious from start to finish - the character wasn't someone many could connect with nor feel any sympathy for. The acting was non-existent and the shark could apparently tear through solid metal...I found myself cheering on the shark so it would put both the woman and the audience out of our misery.
" Solid B Shark movie...
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,7,"To all the people saying, ""Why is the shark ignoring the whale and going for the girl?"". Well have you heard of a thing called 'territoriality'? Often an animal will defend its meal and chase off a potential rival that it thinks is trying to steal its food. Now i will admit it is a bit extreme here but that just to make the movie more dramatic and suspenseful. The ending is a bit goofy i will admit but it was an enjoyable movie."
" A Very Good, Heartwarming Cyborg Story
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,9,"In 2563, while looking for Cyborg parts Dr. Ido (Christoph Waltz) finds a damaged Cyborg body and rebuilds it and names it Alita (Rosa Salazar) to become a functioning Cyborg, but with no memory of who she is, but she's working on it. Alita meets a young man Hugo (Keean Johnson), but soon learns her new world is a dangerous one. She discovers clues to her past fighting the corruption of those who run the City, Iron City. Above iron City is Zalem a city in the sky. Hugo tells Alita that is where he wants to go. You might say it's like a Heaven where life for everyone is good. That's what we are told. Nova (Edward Norton) who says he sees everything runs Zalem. Hmmm................
.
You have to give this a chance as it is a very good, heartwarming story as well as many Cyborg battles, which show excellent CGI and spot on editing. Remember this is more than 300 years in the future and things have changed from what we knew back in 2019. See? Yes, I did say ""heartwarming. "" You'll see. Dr Ido is very protective of Alita and tries to convince Alita that she has been given a second chance at life and to just enjoy it for now. Of course, Alita cannot buy into this and wants to fight when necessary; and Alita finds a kind of love with Hugo. See?Alita discovers that she is a warrior and doesn't shy away from hand to hand combat. Guns are not allowed In Iron City. And Alita has a fondness for the game of RollerBall where many Cyborgs compete. Am glad this did not turn into a Rollerball movie. Alita joins the Hunter Warrior Society. Hunter Warriors are basically Bounty Hunters and only go after their Marks for money.Notables: Jennifer Connelly as Dr. Chiren, Dr. Ido's ex wife and who is a partner in the Rollerball games run by Vector (Mahershala Ali), and who also promises people to send them to Zalem for money or to do a job and both Dr. Chiren and Vector work for Nova, who for the purposes of this story, may be considered a god and we only see him at the end and has given Dr. Chiren and Vector orders to kill Alita; Jackie Earle Haley as Grewiska, a tremendously large Cyborg who meets Alita early on and has orders from Vector to kill Alita; Ed Skrein as Zapan, a Hunter Warrior, who is constantly a nemesis to Alita, and Hugo later on.Note: James Cameron was a producer on this and had screenplay writing input.This is very enjoyable and fast paced too. Rosa Salazar is perfect in the role of Alita and we really enjoyed Christoph Waltz as the very protective Dr. Ido. This story is similar to Japanese Anime where we see colorful graphics and characters with big eyes. Alita has big eyes. See? (9/10)Violence: Yes.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: Briefly at times.
Language: 2 F-bombs.

" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,6,Entertaining and intense movie. was rooting for her throughout. i wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again but i enjoyed the experience. and there wasn't anything dumb or questionable decisions like you would expect with these kinds of movies (1 viewing)
" A good story with a gorgeous main character
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,8,"I have watched this movie a few days ago and I felt that I need to write a short review.
A woman traveling alone in Mexico is going to explore a beach where her mother used to surf when she was young.
Unfortunately, the trip to the secret place ends with a nightmare in which the main character has to face the deadly threat from the sea.
Not to reveal the plot I just want to say that the storyline is really terrifying, however not only because of the script but mostly thanks to the main character perfectly played by Blake Lively.
She is gorgeous in this movie, real and touching in her fight for surviving. Blake is a value-added, without her the movie would not be that good.
I strongly recommend the movie as worth seeing. If you like Blake Lively it is a must-see option.
Additionally the song by Sia - Bird Set Free is just a masterpiece, shame they didn't explore it more during the movie.See the movie you will not regret!"
" My GF insisted we watch it until the end
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,2,"Where to start, besides incredibly stupid, which is probably enough. This is a steel-eating shark with an appetite and stomach to eat two people and keep on hunting. It always knows where she is, and it ignores the giant dead whale in order to hunt the brave smart actress. She sets the ocean on fire with a flare that couldn't light a cigarette, and the ocean buoy cooperates with the director by obediently laying on its side so that she can impale the vengeful shark on its anchor.
Do yourself a favor and write your own movie. I guarantee it will be better than this."
" Alt ending
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,5,"At the end, she should have entered into the water glad to be over her PTSD and physically healed. Then, a shark should have burst up in a fountain of water and eaten her. The End."
" Always surf with a buddy!
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,4,"Nancy misses her late, free-spirit mother, and conjures her memory while taking a break from medical school to visit a Mexican beach that her mom had loved.Played by Blake Lively, Nancy has outer beauty -- the camera never stops reminding us that she has a surf-perfect body -- and emotional conflict. She chooses unreliable friends and turns down the kindness of strangers. Thus, she lies in a text to her travel companion that she'll be staying out late with a ""cute guy"" she'd just met, and she impulsively rejects an offer for a ride back to town after her water fun. Suspense builds as we realize that no one will miss Nancy if she runs into trouble -- and that she does, in the form of a relentlessly prowling shark.Ms. Lively does OK in a role that involves being alone most of the time.
Some of her only speaking is to an injured sea gull -- scenes that come off as trite -- and hoarse but futile shouts toward shore when fellow hapless humans venture into the water.I think this movie does a decent job of conjuring the indifference of nature.
However, its channeling of ""Jaws"" is derivative and cartoonish. In the end, ""The Shallows"" is a weak entry in the genre of nature-horror flicks including the far-stronger ""Blair Witch Project,"" ""Backcountry,"" and ""Open Water"" series."
" Bad one
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,2,"C'mon
Stop making animals serial killers, even if i want to think this was make to entertain its start to be a bad Entertainment just for the fun fact that the effects were bad enough"
" I friggin love this film!
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,9,"The shallows is a great shark-survival- Horror movie. Blake lively is absolutely amazing in this role as she plays a woman who has been attacked by a shark and is now stuck on a rock far from shore as it circles around her. The shark look is amazing, it looks like a real shark and you can tell that they really cared it looked real. They have a perfect setting, which is a remote island on the edge of Australia that looks so beautiful I plan to go myself. The music in this film is good as it really carries the scenes where you get to see the beautiful scenery. It seems that I am a rare audience member that really enjoys all the slo-mo shots in this film, like yeah there is a lot of them but to me that just creates an atmosphere that is tense and anything can happen as we look a the sea looking for the shark, just like the main character. I would watch this film but don't go into thinking about jaws, it's it's own film."
" It's only a movie guys
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,7,"I appreciate and understand the frustration with plot holes, but this is only a movie, not a documentary.
The acting was pretty good, the CGI as good as any and it had tension.
I ignored all the silly plot holes as I do with most movies of this type.
Even the much lauded 'Jaws' has silly plot holes and awful special effects, so in my opinion this movie deserves more credit than some are giving it."
" The seagull was the best character
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,4,"The only animal that behaved as it should in this movie was the seagull. That shark seemed to be unrealistically obsessed with killing people and not just feeding. Surely, once it had had its fill of the huge whale carcass it would have happily swam away, but no! Should have turned this film off after 30 mins."
" Good entertainment
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,9,Loved this well crafted movie and the 57 million made at the box office speaks volumes!
" Entertaining
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,5,"Does not deserve the 1 or 2 star reviews on here. It's not Oscar winning admittedly but it's stunningly shot and entertaining. I am not a fan of cgi so some of the shots were too unrealistic for me but all in all, it's an ok watch."
" The Shallows is a thrilling survival ride.
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,6,The Shallows is a solid B-movie that doesn't pretend to be anything other than a B-movie. That goes a long way in a summer movie season in which several big budget blockbusters have overreached and failed.
" Beyond Horrible
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,1,"Where to begin? Having to stare at an anorexic/bulimic looking Blake Lively for 90 minutes, is draining considering she's one of Hollywood's worst actresses. Amazingly, that's not even the worst part of this movie.
The plot holes and logical fallacies are overwhelming. For starters, we are told the film takes place in Mexico, but its obvious takes place somewhere in the South Pacific. The opening scene is a jeep driving through a Eucalyptus grove. Then we see a beach with a large coral reef and a Silver Gull. None of these things occur in Mexico. Why? Why not just say it all happened in Australia, the actual filming location? It does nothing to serve the storyline.
How does Blake Lively survive for over 24 hours without water, in the middle of the ocean under a tropical sun? After losing a ton of blood? Not only does she survive, she's able to out swim/dive a Great White Shark.This is yet another mindless Hollywood action flick. Its more ""you go girl"" propaganda. Ultimately, Its really an insult to anyone with any intelligence. I was rooting hard for the shark, or the gull to eat up her scraps."
" Not Too Shallow.
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,10,"Blake lively at her best. I can't say I'm familiar with a lot of her movies but what I've seen here is great enough for me to say this film was really good, I enjoyed it. I like films that feature a small cast and not to mention a female heroine & Lively really carries the movie from start to finish. If your a lover of those typical shark movies (Jaws, Deep Blue Sea) then you'll really like this, especially for the tropical location.
As for tense moments, definitely a third way through of the film you see many long shots of how far she is from shore and it leave you with that tense feeling of thinking, ""Could she make it if she swam to shore.?"", she really looked so close to the beach.
All in all a good film, especially if you're a Blake Lively fan."
" Just rubbish
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,3,"The acting and filming isn't too bad, but the entire concept, story, execution and climax was preposterously stupid."
" Not a good movie.
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,2,"These kinds of movies are the reason a beautiful species of animal is being hunted and killed. It's bringing about fear for an animal that we have no reason to fear. Look at the scientific data on the number of people killed by sharks as opposed to other threats in our everyday lives. It's next to zero. These movies do nothing by inflict uneducated fear into humans for a beautiful animal we are fortunate enough to share this planet with!Now. I love a good shark film, the more unrealistic, the better. As sharks don't ever behave as what is depicted in this movie. ""Deep Blue Sea"" is an exceptional shark movie! They have an outlandish story of how they scientifically made the sharks smarter. So the sharks actions & behavior in that movie are justified by the story line.This movie tries to feel real & fails spectacularly! From the behavior of the shark to the injuries she sustained. She had a couple of little cuts...from a shark that was literally chomping people in half, she had a pretty severe onset of gangrene, but didn't lose her foot or leg? I could go on, but I can't be bothered to waste my energy on such a bad movie.Don't bother with this one. Just trust me on that."
" Awful. Just awful.
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,2,"Stupid. More dumb things happening than you can shake a 10 meter cattle prod at. The setup is fine but the shark is mentally handicapped. I can set aside reality for an hour and a half for movies but give me a break. Typical Hollywood garbage for less intellectual folks. The shark death scene has to be one of the dumbest movie moments ever. Also, the cgi was created with a rotten potato. Blake Lively, Oscar Jaenada and Brett Cullen in a B... nah, C-movie. Avoid at all costs.Edit: Blake Lively in a bikini + the seagull are the reason I didn't give it a 1-sar."
" the victory lies in the compact rhythm and not excessive sensationalism.
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,"Although there are not many surprises in the whole plot, the victory lies in the compact rhythm and not excessive sensationalism. Of course, the amount of bleeding and physical strength are still excessive. Beautiful beach ~The actress's acting skills have passed the mark."
" Doesnt make sense.
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,2,Why is the shark so focuses on killing her. I never seen a movie were a shark is so dead set on killing one person. It would make more sense if she did something to the shark. And the only people around doesnt speak her language and there are on 8 people in the whole movie.
" Simple thriller and very practical
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,8,Omg simply superb. Nice and secluded beach. Perfect location for the shark thriller. The beach of no man's land. Simply superb. Oh damn sorry. Superbly simple thriller.
" Really worth watching...
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,7,The movie is really good and worth watching. The story is short and gripping. The movie keeps you on edge of seat from start to end. Some things may feel like illlogical but rest of the movie is brilliant. A good watch.
" Animal lover
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,The story of a young lady who goes to extreme lengths to save an injured seagul from certain death as the tide threatens to submerge the rock it sought refuge on.
" That dumb shark could have saved us all so much of our precious time
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,2,"This was being shown on a long bus journey, and fortunately for us as a captive audience that environment made it very hard to hear the soundtrack.Like many others, I think the seagull was the star performer, and for that alone I have raised my rating from 1 star to 2. As for that dumb shark, well if it had taken a bigger bite at the very first attempt, it could have saved us all so much of our precious time."
" Why? Just why? Was this so .........good!
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,10,"Omg! Bravo. Amazing. Incredible. Best movie I have ever seen. Better than Jaws. I said it. Better than Jaws. Why am I awkwardly distributing periods? Anywho, it was good.
Film critic, Joe"
" Ridiculous, but still scary and enjoyable
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,8,"I know that real sharks don't actually behave like the one in The Shallows, but the shark in this movie acts exactly like my mind imagines a shark would act - it's hungry, it's vindictive and it's persistent. And despite her obviously animated menace, Blake Lively's performance is surprisingly realistic. The ending is somewhat ridiculous, but overall this anxiety-inducing horror movie is fairly enjoyable."
" Technically Difficult to Make, Cartoonish Conclusion
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,6,"After losing her mother, the medical student Nancy (Blake Lively) dumps the medical school in Galveston and travels to Mexico, hitchhiking to a hidden beach that her mother loved when was young. She brings a backpack and a surf board to surf and she meets two surfers that warn about the low and high tides schedule. They leave the sea, but Nancy decides to stay a little more. When she sees a dead whale floating on the water, she swims close to the animal and is surprised by a white shark. She is bitten on the leg and uses her medical knowledge to survive on a rock. But the high tide is coming and she is under siege of the ferocious shark.""The Shallows"" is a reasonable dramatic thriller with ups and downs. It is certainly a film difficult to be made in an environment where everything is under movement and it might be difficult to synchronize the vessel, crane, cast and animals in such environment. Blake Lively might convince as a surfer provided she let only the stunts swim since her arms and legs movements are not from a swimmer with the practice to face those tides. The unrealistic cartoonish conclusion is disappointing with the shark crashing on the buoy mooring debris subsea, remembering the Looney Tunes characters The Road Runner playing tricks to Wile E. Coyote. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Águas Rasas"" (""Shallow Waters"")"
" Boring and predictable
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,1,"Not scary at all, knowing what's going to happen all time in the movie made it a total waste of time."
" Not really worth it.
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,4,"This movie is just mindless and it is neither a thriller nor a comedy. It's good, not the best but good. The ending is really unexcpeted. It would have been better if at the end everything that happened had been a dream. If you've got nothing else to do, you can watch this movie."
" Okay...but what about the bird?
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,4,"The cinematography was great. The acting was great- Blake Lively is pretty awesome, I'm quite a fan of her. But of all the drama and suspense, by the end of the film I was more concerned with whether the bird made it or not. So, quite underwhelming. And let's not even talk about the disbelief of a great white shark on a revenge rampage against a tiny blonde Texan."
" I wish the shark had eaten the writer.
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,5,"Hehe. There's been some funny reviews on this film. I read them while watching the film. If you disengage your brain and take it for what it is (pretty dumb!), then it's an ok film. It's watchable cheese as I like to say. 5/10 is about right. P.S. the CGI was awful!"
" T & A

" Sharks Are Back
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,7,"The Shallows is one little surprisingly good horror flick with a great performance by Blake Lively and - a shark. Lots of suspense and thrill, everything on the point without fillers. Great cinematography too. And this movie just proofs - you don't need a super budget and great setting and stuff to make a great piece of horror. This Shallows just needs a beach, a good actress, a good camera and some FX.If you like movies like Spielberg's Jaws, Open Water (2003), The Reef (2010), Bait (2012), this one will be right up your alley."
" Excellent acting, unrealistically ineffective shark, good story, fun film.
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,6,"When I decided to watch this, I hadn't expected a Horror film (not that The Shallows really fits the genre, but it's close enough). In this regard, I was in for a pleasant surprise, kind of. The protagonist's desperation is very efficiently portrayed, as well as her genuine (and completely justified) fear for her life. The fact that the antagonist is not an evil murderer or a supernatural being of sorts but a terrifying predator did not, in my opinion, make the ordeal less authentic Horror-wise. I believe this film could be enjoyable for anyone who's a fan of similar titles like Anaconda or the classic Jaws.I chose to start off with these statements because most reviews I've seen so far really let The Shallows have it, trashing it like it was a complete waste of time. While I can't help but fully understand their attitude, I don't support it... I personally has a good (if far from great) time watching it and honestly believe anyone not specifically looking for reasons to be completely disappointed - in fact won't be. Why? Here are a few of my personal reasons:1) When I first laid eyes on Blake Lively (protagonist Nancy) I thought ""great, another good for nothing Hollywood eye candy"". I am not too proud to admit it's been long since I've been so wrong. I found her acting is authentic, compelling and absolutely exquisite, taking the entire film to higher levels. You could criticize almost every aspect of The Shallows and I would find it perfectly legitimate (if not always relatable), but not Lively's acting.2) The ocean shots are beautiful. Feels a bit like a cheap cheat meant to distract us from plot holes and other such mistakes, but wow.3) I personally liked the story. All parts seem to connect and it does keep you on edge, even during the less action-packed scenes.Okay, now that I've paid my proper respects, let's talk about the less flattering bits, starting with the shark. Now, I am not a marine biologist or even a devout fan of nature documentaries, but I know enough to know when a predator is ""nerfed"". Quite early in the film Nancy suffers a crippling injury due to a shark bite to her leg, but the wound looks a little more troubling than a paper cut. That's it. This is not a baby piranha, this is a white shark. It doesn't ""miss"" and it doesn't deal flesh wounds. On the off chance that its bite doesn't immediately kill - it dismembers limbs as easily as a knife cuts through jelly. Maintaining suspense of disbelief after such a mockery of trivial knowledge is possible, but extremely challenging, and who would want to make an effort in order to enjoy a movie??? The shark continues to be ridiculously ineffective throughout the rest of the story, to a point of stupidity. While the story is compelling and suspenseful enough to distract you of this fact, there was never, not once, a time when Nancy was out of its range or in any way safe, and yet it doesn't attack. Why? Because we have a movie to shoot, so let's ignore everything we know about sharks...Second, of course, is the almost grotesque bit with a wounded seagull keeping Nancy company (again, let's forget what we know, this time about birds). Without giving away any spolers, I'm not sure if the writers were attempting a wink at Castaway's ""Wilson"", but that's all it felt like... ""She's wounded and stranded, let's add a strange bedfellow"". Nothing short of comic, really not what you want in a movie meant to cause suspense and discomfort.All in all, like I've said, there is a fair amount of good bits making The Shallows a fun and rewarding viewing experience, but only if you're able to ignore the annoyingly unrealistic parts. While I was pleasantly surprised and happy to see the relatively high rating, I can't in good conscience give it more than a 6, most of which is due to Lively's acting and the fact that I did enjoy myself. Lower your expectations - and I believe you'll enjoy yourselves too."
" Tense
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,7,"A young American woman goes surfing alone at a secluded beach in Mexico but finds herself stranded on a rock with a hungry great white shark circling. And a seagull called Steve for company!
This makes a great change from the glut of ridiculous shark movies ""inspired"" by the likes of 'Sharknado"". No roaring shark (I didn't hear any anyway) and no CGI that looks like they were done by a 5 year old. Sure, there are goofs and gaffs, and I felt that the final showdown was pretty silly. However it is nicely filmed, has decent effects, plenty of tension and Blake Lively does a good job as the heroine. She also looks mighty fine in a bikini!"

Well played, well made and a super cute seagull that is with the protagonist on the rock almost all the time :)"
" There are better and worse shark movies
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,5,"Solid angry shark movie, about a woman stuck on a rock 100 yards out to sea with a shark circling her. A woman on a rock for 90 minutes might get boring, and they cover this with some OK plot devices and some silly ones (she makes friends with the seagull from Little Mermaid. Oh dear. Also the sub plot about her dropping out of medical school was a time filler that didn't land very well for me. There are better ones: eg the much cheaper 47 Metres Down, and (obviously) Jaws. The ending was a bit silly too.Acting: not bad. She was a good actor, but not particularly likeable, which is an issue with a one person cast.Cinematography/effects: absolutely awesome. Everything looked great."

I was excited for this as it was one of the first shark movies to come out at the theatres for a while.I am not a big fan of Blake Lively but I thought she played the role of stranded victim brilliantly. I wanted her to survive through out the movie and was cheering her on.You do have to suspend belief in a couple of scenes but other then that, the movie was great. You really feel the tension, suspense and the isolation she feels being stuck in the middle of nowhere.The special effects for the shark were top pnotch. I can only think of two scenes where the CGI wasn't great, but 99% of the time the shark did indeed look real.So don't let some of the negative reviews away you, check it out for yourself"
" What a shame, what a disappointment. Feel sorry for Blake.
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,3,"What a shame, I was looking forward to this movie, mainly thanks to Blake, I really like her, I think she has got a talent, havent expected anything special from the movie though, just to enjoy and relax watching nice set and great white shark. But boy, I am sorry but what a bunch of ignorants is behind this? I really thought that the days people are presenting this amazing animal as a killing, ruthless beast behaving like psychopath are far over. Attacking from down below? Chasing the girl straight down? Like seriously? Are you even grown ups?Every 5yr old kid knows these are the moves sharks never do, never behaving like idiotic drug eddict. Where is the respect to this animal?Omg.And thats what really pi..ed me off. I understand that you cant make a nerve wracking movie with real great white, as it would be boring and impossible to create a drama, so thats only one solution to this. Stop making the movies with great white at last! It wont work! World doesnt need that! Not everybody in this world must be making movies! And Blake should be really carefull who she teams up with, it is a very thin line between being respected or being forever connected with films beyond rediculousness, this is one of them. Also at the end I wondered what happened to her friend who stayed in the hotel, not missing her friend at all for almost two days :)))). Guys, you give changing your career a really strong thought."
" OMG
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,3,"I started with such high hopes for this movie. At first I thought I was going to be a serious drama. But after it pulls you in, it slowly strips you away of any suspension of disbelief you have left until you're shaking head at the end wondering you just wast an hour and a half on this rubbish. Blake was fine. Too bad the writer and director didn't take the movie as serious."
" Kept me seated through the whole minutes run time
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,8,"I really did enjoy this movie. If you're the type that pays attention to very unrelated things in the movie, like what color is what, or you just try looking for flaws in the movie, then this movie is not for you. If you would rather shift your attention to the focus of the movie plot which is how a lady with all odd against her tries her possible best to survive a shark attack and still go back to what she loves, This is a movie you would definitely enjoy"
" You REALLY Have To Suspend Your Disbelief With This One.
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,5,"I realize now why it's rated PG-13. If you're over that age you're bound to find so many plot holes you'd think it was written by a 10 year old. No sense in pointing out some of the non-believable scenes here - quite a few critics have already done that on IMDb. What I'd like to talk about is scenery.It wasn't until reading the credits at the end of the movie when I found out that it wasn't filmed in Mexico but Australia. That sure was one mighty fine beach. I liked the added colours they swept in to make the blues, yellows and reds of the pristine water shimmer. I think that was worth some of the price of admission. The story? Not so much. See this flick if you like travelogues. Skip if you want a story that makes sense."
" Great shark movie
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,10,My only issue is that the shark try's to attack a woman sitting on top of a eaten 90ton whale other than that this movie and 47 meters down were all great movies
" Medicore But fun
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,7,"I liked the suspense you could feel when the shark was around, but at the same time, the shark seemed too dedicated to hunt and kill this specific lady. Especially when there is a giant whale lying dead a few yards away from the rock. It gets to a point where the shark is ready to do anything to eat this lady, I get a Jaws 3 feeling where the shark traveled to the Bahamas just to try to kill these people. The end really threw me off, It was such an unrealistic ending, she knew that the sharpy thing was there and that the shark was going to follow her all the way down to the bottom and die. Not taking into consideration that if the shark didn't follow her or if it attacked in another angle she would have been shark food.All and all I would not recommend this movie if you want to see a human vs animal thriller. But if you want to see some fun, fast-paced, shark attack scenes, sure."
" Do not waste your time
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,1,This is quite possibly the worst ever film I have seen. Second only to the Blair witch project.
" Simple but compelling story...
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,8,"I liked this film very much. The cinematography is amazing. The pace is perfect. This is the first time that I have seen Blake in any film and she is a very talented actress in this. And having her spend most of the time in a bikini, is very easy on the eyes. This type of film is very hard to pull off, well ""any"" film is hard to pull off in actuality and have it ""work"", because most of the film you are alone with one character. 
The only two flaws that I have were; 1. the overuse of slow-motion 2. The gimic of using real time Cut To slow mo Cut To real time which is as cliche' as using a pop-up window and... 3. the last 2 minutes of her ""confrontation"" which was Hollywood B-S compared the entire rest of the film which was totally believable. As far as a ""film"" plot is concerned. Overall well worth watching."
" The bird was the most interesting character
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,2,"I watched this because my flatmate had it on and I became intrigued as to how this woman was going to get away from the shark, because it was blatantly obvious she wasn't going to die, so I sat there and watched it all. Turns out I shouldn't have bothered. What tosh!
A woman goes surfing and gets attacked by a shark, she then ends up on a rock and with high tide approaching she has to figure out a way to get off her little rock and back to safety.
The biggest thing that annoyed me was continuity, or lack of. One minute she looks severely dehydrated but then in the next shot she looks absolutely fine... oh, wait... she's dehydrated again! This happens continuously throughout. Another annoyance, which other reviewers have mentioned, is her super human strength! She has a huge gash on her leg and was losing a lot of blood, she had multiple cuts and grazes, gangrene on the gashed leg, several smacks in the arms, legs, face, no water, no food, and no sun lotion!! Yet somehow none of this seemed to affect her and she could still swim (faster than a shark I might add) climb, kick, and flail her arms about at anyone she saw on the shore. Now if that were any normal human being we'd be passed out from blood loss and exhausted from having had no food, water and too much sun!
Overall I really bad movie that wasn't scary, suspended disbelief and continuity errors throughout.
The only redeeming feature was the bird who kept her company."
" This plot has more holes in it than Swiss cheese
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,4,"I wanted to like this movie, but it's just so stupid I can't.I love the beautiful bay and the long shots showing how pretty it is. But problem 1: where are the waves? There aren't any! It's clear that the actual surfing shots were filmed elsewhere. Come on... you don't surf on a beach with no waves. Sigh.Other problems:
2. A shark that size bites you, and all you have is a tiny nick in your leg?
3. There's a juicy fat whale carcass right there, but the shark is only interested in bony human beings?
4. That whale carcass appeared out of nowhere? She's been surfing there all day, and suddenly turns her head and it's magically 60 feet away? 
5. Why would you try to eat a crab after just a few hours? Just nonsensical.
6. The CGI dolphins were quite bad. But not as bad as the fake wound on her leg. I've seen 1980 horror movies with better blood... and they had a $500 budget.
7. The water is clearly shallow, as you can see in the aerial shots. Yet at the end when she sinks to the bottom, it's suddenly 60+ feet deep?!
8. Holding on to that chain would've ruptured her eardrums in seconds because she wasn't equalizing.
9. That shark is dumb enough to swim full force into the bottom of the ocean? 
10. Why is there a buoy there, of all places? 
11. Am I supposed to believe a beach this nice is right next to Tijuana, within walking distance of drunks, yet there's nobody there, no garbage, nothing? 
12. Something tells me you wouldn't have a 4G connection on that beach to stream video on your phone.Sigh. It's a shot, and it's a miss! Wasted opportunity. Watch a re-run of Jaws instead."
" I was excited for this movie
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,1,How the hell do surfers not see a HUGE whale being devoured by sharks? Brie Larson is going to play Captain Marvel in the Marvel cinematic universe. Get out of here
" Stellar and highly enjoyable killer shark film
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,9,"Taking a trip to a secluded beach, a woman intending to surf in the area where her and her mother surfed years earlier is attacked by a shark prowling the area and tries to survive the encounter long enough to get help as her limited supplies and slowly slipping conscious derail her chances.This one was quite the enjoyable and somewhat thrilling effort. Most of what works here with this one is the fact that it takes quite a bit of suspense from the situation that comes naturally in such a situation. This type of setup is one of the more realistic and believable type of situations for a shark attack where it occurs in a secluded area involving a lone shark in an area targeting other factors around the environment and only just turning the attention to the surfer only by proxy. The behavior of the creature, seemingly more interested in the free meal around it than spending it dealing with her and only turning its attention to her once she gets into the water because of the cuts she has, comes off as incredibly realistic and seemingly in tune with how such creatures behave in real life. This in turns gives the suspense of the few attack scenes quite a bit of power as they carry themselves out. The initial attack out on the middle of her surf into shore is quite nice due to the obvious shots of it stalking her from the beginning and it strikes at a truly unexpected time leaving this with quite a nice surprise. The series of attacks in the water as she tries to survive are incredibly thrilling, using the shrinking location and the continuous onslaught of the creatures' appearances to stellar effect as her worsening physical condition makes for a fantastic counter to the rest of the situation. The finale on the buoy is stellar as well, giving this a nice action quotient and a rousing finale that's perfect for this kind of effort, and alongside the great prop shark that's involved here really holds this one up over its minor flaws. About the only real factor involved in knocking this one down is the utterly severe amount of injuries inflicted here that don't really make any kind of sense as to why she's still able to fight back. It's quite obvious that the initial wound is quite striking and severe, but to then feature the bruising across the body from the rock sanctuary, the multitude of cuts and scrapes trying to get to safety or the series of crashes and cuts while fighting the shark off at the buoy that cause her plenty of additional bloodless alongside what she's already gone through. This just doesn't look logical at all and is the real negative force holding this one back which isn't really all that detrimental at all.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language."
" Yeah, not that deep (but not that bad, either)
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,6,"Woman versus flippin' massive shark? Who's going to win? Well, 'The Shallows' goes some way to answer that question (and Blake Lively as the women in question is really going to need a 'bigger boat'). She plays a young woman who goes on a personal pilgrimage to an isolated beach where her (now deceased) mother went to just before she fell pregnant. Blake indulges in a spot of surfing before finding herself trapped on a rock a few hundred yards away from the shore with a 'fin' swimming round and round her position.And that's basically that. What follows is an entire hour and a half of her trying to find a way off a rock. Yeah, it's a pretty simple premise and, although it does drag in some places, it's actually a perfectly watchable way of killing time. Being the only human on screen for much of the run-time Blake has to carry the film and she does that well enough. There are a few other characters who pop up here and there, but I don't think you'll be too surprised to find what happens to them!The location is great and the film could almost be used as a tourist video for the area (assuming you weren't bothered about being eating by a huge, angry fish), plus there's plenty of epic surfing shots. I'm sure I could find out on the internet whether Blake actually did all of them herself, or whether there was CGI trickery involved somewhere. Either way, they're really cool and totally convincing. And, while we're on the subject of special effects, I should mention the shark. We don't see much of it (besides the obligatory fin) for much of the movie, leaving its 'reveal' to the final act. And, I was a little disappointed. We're many decades away from 'Jaws' and yet creating a convincing shark hasn't really moved on that much.I can see a lot of the other reviews have marked 'The Shallows' a lot higher than I have. I can see how it might be enjoyed more than I did. I didn't hate it. I just felt that a story about a woman on a rock could have been trimmed down to a more 'TV episode' length rather than an entire movie. But, I don't regret watching it, however I doubt I'll bother watching it again, simply because it's simple story means you can quite clearly remember all you need to for quite some time without feeling the need for a re-watch."
" It's not total shark poop.
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,6,"When it comes to the work of Sully ""Steven"" Seagull I would have to say this is his best work.He is dynamic, hits all lines and he works well with co-star Blake Lively. She is decent, but her performance doesn't quiet have the depth of Seagulls. Over all it's an ok suspense/horror/cast away movie. I'm hoping Sully gets more out of his co-stars next time."
" Beyond stupid
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,1,"The ""meat"" of this drama, if you will, starts with a 30(?) foot shark choosing the kicking, bony non-natural food item Blake Lively over a lifeless whale carcass that'd be much safer and nutritional to eat. It only goes downhill from there.The shark inexplicably circles an outcropping of rock inexhaustibly, trapping Lively and eschewing its natural inclination to roam the sea in search of prey. Maybe it's the vengeful, near-human obsession with eating this surfer. But for an ocean-going creature, it's oddly clumsy, bumping into nearly everything it comes near. It does manage to nip her on the leg but all's well - not only does the gash nearly instantaneously coagulate and close on its own, she manages to stitch it with a necklace she's been wearing.Meanwhile, Lively manages to stave off her life-threatening hunger after ONE DAY by munching on live crabs and makes a friend of a seagull who - after she fixes its dislocated wing - stays by her side in a show of seeming solidarity. Think Little Mermaid. Several people come to her aid, all to be eaten in gruesome ways because she belongs to the shark, damn it.Inexplicably, Lively decides her salvation lies in reaching the buoy 30 yards further out to sea and makes it by swimming through a neon forest of jellyfish, which she instinctively knows the shark will dislike. Once on the buoy, she unlocks the flare gun box (c'mon, we all know ancient buoys have flare gun boxes) but fails to flag down a passing ship.But all is not lost. Because there's apparently no current in the Pacific ocean, the oil slick leading from the buoy to the dead whale (which the shark has ignored for two days running) is intact and immediately catches fire when a flare is fired into it. This burns the shark but succeeds only in making it angrier. It follows Lively as she sinks impossibly fast to a trench in the ocean ell ahead of the shark, who nonetheless is on her heels. But alas, our clumsy aggressor impales itself on the remnants of the metal buoy it only moments before ripped apart. Lively is washed ashore and rescued by a boy and his father only live to surf another day.Seriously."
" So Fake
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,1,This movie is unrealistic. The water in Galveston is not that clear.
" Lucky You! Blake Lively is Here..
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,4,"This movie is very very very boring and freaking weird! Like in this movie the shark really has mind to targeting just one person for days.
The only reason you stay watching this movie is just because Blake Lively looked so hot there nothing's more."
" The Shallows - TENSE!
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,6,"Tense and gripping, Jaws this is not. But despite that I found I couldn't take my eyes off it. Pretty darned good stuff."
" Compelling
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,7,"""The Shallows"" is a surprisingly well-made and intense movie. Some plot points are very far-fetched, there is an overuse of slow motion and the ending gets quite ridiculous BUT Blake Lively is perfect in the role, the scenery is stunning and it is exquisitely filmed with great visual effects. Sound & music worked well! All in all, it is a compelling survival thriller. I didn't expect it to be this good."
" Lost 2 hours of my life
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,2,"The beginning wasn't so bad, but then... the drunken guy gets in the water to steal the board, the shark jumps on rocks, the CGI, the medecine class, the seagull..."
" Another shark movie
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,6,"Just another shark movie. A great white shark bites a young and emotionally hurt surfer's leg and she tries to get out of the water. Decent movie with some good scenes and more than needed bikini shots. The shark behaved unrealistic in most of the movie but the gull was a true star. And after all, how was this beach called?"
" One of the best shark movies.
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,8,"Absolutely bloody fantastic! The photography is amazing, the location is breathtaking, Blake Lively's performance is incredible and the entire production is fantastic! Nerve-wreckingly suspenseful and brilliant! The scenery is great and wonderfully photographed, so its best viewed on Blu Ray."
" Exciting jaws-type movie
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,8,Very good exciting film - kept the tension on a high level throughout.
" A weak lead; but the rest's pretty good
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,6,"THE SHALLOWS is yet another survival flick in which a young, bikini-clad woman is menaced by an impossibly menacing killer shark. This one was shot on the glorious Queensland coast in Australia, and features Blake Lively (doing what her husband Ryan Reynolds did in BURIED) as a woman attacked and stranded by an improbably hungry shark. The film takes a minimalist approach but fails to entertain on the same level as similar mini-classics such as THE REEF and ROGUE, although it's still an enjoyable watch. The cinematography is very nice indeed, and the shark itself, although barely seen, utilises some effective CGI to create the menace. I was less impressed with the lead character, although her survivalist skills and instincts are fun, and I suppose that's what stopped me from being totally immersed in the experience as I was hoping to be. Still, this is a cut above all of the shark movies put out by The Asylum and SyFy Channel."
" Someone gave this 10 out of 10?
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,1,This movie was horrible! I have never wrote a review before and I wish I could specifically comment on someone else's review because that's basically why I'm doing this. Somebody gave this a 10 out of 10! They even went as far as to saying the shark wasn't portrayed as some kind of man eating Beast. But yet it killed everybody it came into contact with. The acting was crappy the storyline was be on predictable and really did they need to throw in her dead mother at the end? Ouch my brain hurts from watching this movie! Do not I repeat do not waste one moment of your life watching this movie. Watch thankskilling instead.
" A Decent Shark Movie
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,7,"The opening few minutes of this film give us a bit of a back story about Nancy (Blake Lively) - who's come on a trip to a beach she used to come to with her late mother in an attempt apparently to pull herself together after her mother's death. That wasn't too long (too much examination of a character's backstory can be tedious) and so it served its purpose. After that, once Nancy gets to the beach we have some really good surfing footage as Nancy and a couple of locals are out on the waves enjoying themselves. Then comes the problem - her two surfing buddies leave while Nancy goes back out to catch one last wave as she says. Instead of a wave, she encounters a shark. Bitten and bleeding, she finds ""safety"" safety on an island that's not much more than a rock and that will likely disappear when the tide comes in - and there's no one around to rescue her.I will say that Lively was pretty good. I haven't really seen much of her and nothing she's done stands out for me. But she managed to carry this pretty well. Nancy was, for the most part, the only character in the movie, and Lively was able to make her plight interesting and realistic. I was impressed with her. Having said that, with so much of the movie set on Nancy's plight on the rock, this does get a bit tiresome after a while, because there's only so much that can be done in that setting. But still, you do sympathize with Nancy. Obviously, the movie leads up to the ultimate confrontation between Nancy and the shark, which turns out to be somewhat implausible.As shark movies go - and there seem to have been a lot of them lately, including the approximately 84 Sharknado movies that seem to have appeared in recent years - this one was pretty good. It's short, so even the somewhat draggy middle goes by fairly quickly, it's graphic in places and every now and then frightening. The CGI shark was pretty good - although pretty much all of these shark movies leave me wondering about the sharks. From everything I've read, sharks basically don't like the taste of we humans. Apparently we don't have enough fat on us for their taste buds - and Blake Lively certainly doesn't. So this shark's obsession with her is kind of a mystery. I can understand its initial curiosity, but once it got a bite it really should have lost interest. But then we wouldn't have had a movie, I suppose. And this does turn out to be a pretty decent movie. (7/10)"
" A great film
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,9,"I do not agree with the negative reviews of this film. Yes, you can debate the technical aspects of high and low tide together with ocean currents and depths and shark behaviour all day but this is a movie and not a science documentary. I hadn't heard of this film and so I was not sure what to expect. I was however hooked from the very beginning and found it very enjoyable. There have been films that are similar to the classic 'Jaws"" over the years but this film brought back memories of watching Jaws as a child. The camerawork, pace and characters are superb and I found myself constantly trying to work out the characters next move. As I say, it is easy to pick faults in the technical aspects of a film and it might not be to everyone's taste but I very much enjoyed watching this and would certainly recommend it."
" Straight to the point shark thriller
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,7,"The Shallows is a relatively simply shark stranded thriller with the trailers showing exactly the type of film it is. This is a film which showcases Blake Lively as a strong leading actress and the film made a profit within its box office. Most criticism comes from the fact that it may seem unrealistic at times but overall the film does a decent job at keeping those on the edge of the seat, while maintaining and engaging and entertaining plot. The cgi is well done and keeps it simply throughout the film. The Shallows has a relatively slow start but within minutes has a quick build up to the point where we see Blake stranded by the rock. What was difficult in reasoning is how long she was on the rock with no food but yet seemed to have enough energy in swimming back and forth. Also as of note she meets a small seagull which steals the show in the end.Overall, the Shallows is a small simple film with a simple intention at entertaining and in does the job. Recommend to those whom enjoy this sort of films. Nothing to take too serious but relax."
" Very enjoyable horror thriller with a shark, not quite great but definitely a worthwhile watch!
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,7,"This joined the extremely limited number of what I'd consider to be good shark movies that I've ever seen, I thought it had a great solid setup and a pretty immersive atmosphere that let you imagine a little of how scary such a situation would be. I found it overall to be a good movie because to me, for the most part it used the shark in an effective way that played up to its natural strengths as a terrifying predator of the sea, you constantly feel the threat of it lurking somewhere beneath the waves, and while we all know what a Great White looks like, when they really started showing it in all its vicious toothy glory it looked awesome, and was to me some fantastic cgi. I thought the beautiful Blake Lively gave a strong performance that very well conveyed her fear and as well as her will to survive against a very determined beast as the few options available to her gradually disappeared along with her ever-shrinking point of safety. I can see why they gave her the precious seagull to play off though, I don't think any actor could spend practically a whole movie's length standing on a rock completely alone and make it work.(James Franco? Hm..) Even Tom Hanks had Wilson! I think that in the closing scene when she's surfing again it should have revealed that she'd lost her leg instead of just having a little scar, it would have been more fitting and given a little more weight to her ordeal. There are certainly times when the shark action does start to feel noticeably Farfetched, like the jellyfish thing and when she sets it on fire with the whale oil, and especially how she gets it to impale itself on the buoy rebars...but I don't know it was a somewhat glossy thriller, it felt like it earned those moments and I think the final confrontation did call for something with a touch more oomph anyway.. Probably the biggest hole in the movie is why exactly a fairly mindless shark would bother tirelessly stalking one stranded human that it couldn't even really get to when it had a whole dead whale right there, or after it devoured those two and a half people! Sharks aren't really capable of becoming enraged or even territorial, last I checked, but it did work well for the plot, and I had fun with the flick, we already got a one hundred percent realistic shark movie that was called Open Water and it was a boring pile of crap. The most appealing thing about the move for me would have to be the visuals, all the beautiful bright open shots of the beach and the crashing blue sparkling waters were uplifting to look at and it had to be one of the most prettiest movies I've ever seen. It was cool too to have a semi-horror movie that was set in broad vivid daylight instead of the usual drabness. So while some might find it slow I was consistently engaged by this movie and I found it to be a tense and entertaining flick that I thought made great use of the shark as a classic menace and that to me made up for its flaws, and I'm glad that there are still the odd bright spots to be found in an often brutally abused horror sub-genre yet!"
" Shallow shark movie
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,4,"As someone who is extremely fearful of sharks, this movie did not scare me one bit. Jaws on the other hand, even though it is 40 years older has physicality.. you feel there is something in the water not just some cgi fish. The music in Jaws also helps a great deal to sell the illusion whereas the music in this movie is completely unmemorable The one thing that did look really good was the bite wound and although the way she was dealing with it was a bit ridiculous, the blood spurts did make me feel queasy. But in terms of shark attacks the audience sees nothing basically Overall there are too many unintentionally funny moments.. the seagull, the psychedelic jellyfish sequence, and the way the shark attacks the bouy and dies at the endThe acting is also not the best, especially the bit where she records a short video for her family in case she dies.. so bad I can't recommend this movie except as mindless entertainment"
" A So-So Movie
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,5,"Former police officer Danny Gallagher (Karl Urban) gets out of prison for serving his time for killing an undercover police officer during a failed drug bust. As a private citizen he gets involved in another case where a woman is blown up in a car, but is also wants to kill Driscoll (John Finn) who betrayed him and his partner during that failed bust. The word Bent is meant to mean a dirty cop and it is used a lot during the movie. Danny Gallagher was never Bent. See? This was the first time I ever heard ""Bent"" from any movie. Most of the movie is taken up with solving Jennifer's (Cherish Gaines) murder who was blown up in the car in the beginning of the movie. Danny is helping her brother find out what exactly happened. We learn that all this has to do with a money laundering scheme and a government conspiracy that the FBI is keeping tabs on via Agent Rebecca (Sofia Vergara).Now do we care about any of this? Of course not. We have seen this story a million times. Was it good? No, mostly because we didn't care about anything in the movie. Sofia Vergara needs to stick to comedy because she was quite wooden in here. What we could have cared about was that Danny would find a way to clear himself of accidently killing that undercover police officer and getting back into the good graces of the police department. This never happened. Danny claims he was framed for that killing. So Danny is focused on killing Driscoll who killed Danny's partner, and who gets out of prison soon. Notables: Andy Garcia as Jimmy, Danny's mentor; Grace Byers as Kate, Danny's love interest; Tonya Cornelisse as Helen, Danny's one night stand; Bill Pacheco as Pierce, husband of Jennifer and he watched her being blown up in that car. This is a so-so movie where there is no actual pull to keep watching. (But you did anyway). The story could have been better told. (5/10)Violence: Yes.
Sex: No.
Nudity: Yes.
Lesbian Kiss: Brief.
Language: Yes, near the end.
Humor: No. Could have used some in here.

" Good on many levels
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,7,"I didn't have high expectations for The Shallows. I simply hoped it would be as tense as Open Water. It didn't quite live up to the latter, but don't dismiss this film as just a run-of-the-mill thriller. It's actually quite a lot better than that.Blake Lively plays our strong, brave, and resourceful heroine, Nancy, an excellent surfer. If I were rating her rather than the film, she'd get a 9.0. Her performance was really admirable, especially when one considers that, just like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, she has to carry 95% of the movie (but more about that later...)The plot is straightforward: while at a beach whose very name is vigorously protected by the locals (to discourage hoards of tourists finding and despoiling their little sandy paradise), Nancy is attacked by a great white shark while surfing.She is more or less trapped on a small rock that will be covered in water by high tide. Now we've got our ticking clock. Not only does she have to stay alive by attending to her shark bite and the elements, but she has to figure a way off the rock before it's too late.Providing more plot details won't enhance your enjoyment of the movie, so that's all I'll mention on the subject.The last scenes of Nancy vs. the shark strain credulity, but we don't care. This is a movie where we simply root for Nancy to survive. I won't say if she does or not. However, despite the overboard girl versus shark climax, I actually came away with a high regard for the film because it did something jaded movie goers don't expect: it impressed me.How did it impress me? The action scenes are so well done that we are drawn into them, rather than passively watching and checking the time on my watch. Once the movie concluded, a few thoughts passed through my mind: how did they film such amazing shark sequences? It has to be a mechanical shark, but it sure looks real. Yeah, they go overboard with it being a super-shark (but still... it's name is the GREAT White Shark!), but that must have been visually stunning in an actual movie theatre (regrettably I saw this as a Netflix movie, on a television screen).I started wondering how they could make the movie look so flawless. They take good advantage of the scenery, the shark, and they keep us totally invested in Nancy's outcome. That's tough to do when she's stuck on a rock for long stretches, but they pull it off nicely.They say a movie is a collaborative effort, and this certainly proves it. Good acting, an amazing director: Jaume Collet-Serra, enviable cinematography, and smart editing keeps us interested.So is this a movie for the ages that you'll be raving about in 20 years. Nope, but it's also doubtful that you'll be bored watching it, which is somewhat of a rarity nowadays, unless your watching some $250 million Marvel comics movie.If you want a pleasant (gripping!) one hour and twenty-six minutes, and liked Open Water, then this is the movie for you."
" At times the film asks for too much to be taken at face value, but it's still a pretty tense and entertaining ride
",2018-06-06 00:00:00,6,"Keen surfer and aspiring doctor Nancy Adams (Blake Lively) heads to a secluded beach in Mexico for a spot of surfing. However, she ends up in difficulties when she is attacked by a shark. Nancy soon finds herself pitting her wits against the fearsome creature in order to get the better of it before the tide comes in...When watching any film involving a battle of wits with a shark then it's inevitable that comparisons are going to be made to Jaws which is clearly the yardstick that all of these films are going to be measured against. In this respect, The Shallows doesn't actually do a bad job and is better than I expected it to be, but it is still lacking in one or two areas...For a start I did find that the film asked me to ignore or accept too many things at face value that are either illogical or just simply contrived; a half eaten man is lay somewhere on the beach, but 2 surfers return back the next day and fail to notice said corpse on the beach before entering the water - you could argue that the half eaten man could have got swept back out to sea before the break of dawn, but at this point I believe that it was long before the tide was coming in so if this did happen it would totally go against the narrative. They also fail to notice Nancy stranded on the rock until they're halfway into the sea and don't seem to be able to hear her warnings about the shark (even though earlier a practically comatosed drunkard could hear what she was saying from twice the distance.)The film also asks you to accept some rather ridiculous contrivances; an army of jellyfish happen to congregate in the very path of the place that Nancy needs to get to (for seemingly no real reason) and she ascertains that she'll be safe passing through the jellyfish as the shark won't chase her as it won't want to get stung?? Seriously? Are we expected to buy this? Quite how she would know this is in anyone's guess? Is she a marine biologist or does she drink with David Attenborough? She also apparently manages to navigate through several jellyfish whilst badly injured and only gets stung once (and yet she just yells 'Ow' and carries on). Really? I would have thought that any human that was stung by a jellyfish that size would be in pain for hours, but seemingly not here.OK.OK. Enough is enough. I think I've made my point that this film has more holes in it than Swiss cheese, but in fairness it does work fairly well as a survival film; Nancy's medical skills do serve some purpose in the film and are what keeps her going and keeps her alive (this side of the story is probably the only believable aspect). She spends a great chunk of her time with a wounded bird which was actually quite a sweet angle to the story. Despite occasional moments of stupidity and some ridiculous contrivances I have to admit that this film did entertain me and had just about enough tension to make it worthwhile (sure it isn't Jaws, but despite the multitude of flaws it isn't actually a bad film when all is said and done.)"
" Good, with an element of dumb
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"Nancy, struggling with life choices following her mother's death, drops out of medical school and goes surfing, finding by chance the idyllic and undiscovered Mexican beach her mother so loved when she was carrying Nancy. The surfing is great. Unfortunately an enormous shark hangs out in the bay and, having killed a humpback whale, it has a go at Nancy who, despite being badly bitten on the leg, manages to heave herself onto a rock. However, the rock will disappear at high tide. Can she make it to the nearby buoy before the shark catches her?This simple, and fairly short, story of survival is lovely to look at (not least because Blake Lively, especially in swimwear, is easy on the eye). Given the claustrophobic and limited setting - a rock, a buoy, a beach, a shark - it manages to remain suspenseful for well over an hour, and you are never sure whether Nancy will make it or not: the ""giveaway"" at the start is, you come to realise, no such thing.The shark is digital and makes you wonder what Spielberg would have given for CGI when he was making Jaws - none of that messing around with Bruce breaking down!Conversely, the filmmakers here have pretty much ignored the trouble Spielberg took to make sure of consistency with sea and weather conditions - the sea varies from huge waves to pancake smooth in consecutive shots.
In fact, the biggest problem I had with the film was that sort of lack of attention to detail. The timetable of the tides is quite crucial, for instance, and given to the audience quite specifically so that they understand Nancy's jeopardy as the tide rises, yet the exposure of the rock is often completely inconsistent with the state of the tide.And - I'm terribly sorry - sharks don't behave like that. This one is worse than the one in Jaws for bearing grudges. And why it is hanging around for a bit of sweet Lively thigh when there is an enormous whale carcass floating 100 yards away, I don't know. OK, I'd go for Blake Lively's thigh in preference to a rotting whale any day of the week, but I'm not a shark. Plus why is there a buoy in the middle of a bay where no-one goes, apparently marking nothing in particular. I accept it's handy to have one there when the rock you're perched on is about to disappear under the waves, but still..."
" B-Movie with a budget.
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,5,"There's some nice stuff in this and some bits that really don't work. The set up with the GoPro footage is very effective, tantalising, a great intro. But then the next scene has some overlayed graphics of the main character flipping through photos on her phone. It's a nice device for a corporate video (in fact I might pinch it), but it's really not cinematic and breaks the tension already built. This is a problem in general, overthought style, slomo surf shots with trance music blasting over the top. It feels like a promo for the beach. The phone overlay stuff is used time and again trying to fill in some back story, but it's incredibly jarring. There's lots of underwater Jaws type shots that thankfully by the 20 minute mark helps build some tension and from here on it does get better. Essentially though it's a B movie with a budget and for all it's plus points, it ruins the good things it has going. A much grittier treatment would've worked wonders. It's a simple story, not particularly original, but a good creative director could've done so much more."
" What Can I say
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,6,"Although there are many many flaws in this movie, I still enjoyed watching it. It was entertaining and Blake was stunning. After all this is an entertainment movie and not a documantary. Watching the body of Blake from all possible angles all over again isn't quite a horror. The bird deserves an Oscar."
" Lively didn't have a chance
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,3,"Since I don't think even Tom Hanks could carry ""Castaway""; This poor girl never had a chance. The idea seemed good going into it, but very few people can act by themselves (if any). I feel sorry for this actor, she did the best she could with a loser situation.
The other ""actors"" in this garbage were totally worthless. A complete waste of time."
" Rubbish
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,3,"Don't wast your time with this one, it's a film about nothing.The first 25 minutes of the film are squandered with mobile chats, car rides, stripping into swimwear, paddling out, chatting and surfing. You already know you're in trouble when the filler drags out this long.And then the plot holes and implausibilities start kicking in like the recent Alien films. Her watch tells her the tide will be low in 'x' amount of hours, but the tide never goes out; and she stitches her wounds with pieces of jewellery; and getting a couple of well-timed kicks onto the shark's nose; and befriending a seabird that's also a survivor of shark attacks (no doubt); and scrambling up onto the back of a floating whale as if that's even possible.... and more and more parts of an implausible film that was 75% boring tripe. The only person of note in this film is Blake Lively, and she survived her rendezvous with the shark thingy on the rocks, and managed to get back to her normal life in Texas, that's it..So many rigged reviews on this site, it's quite unacceptable really, with comments like 'best shark film EVA' like that's a compliment or something, considering that shark films are pretty dreadful anyway, and 'a really good summer blockbuster', like that makes it OK then because it's the holidays and no-one really cares in a dizzy sort of way.Lame film with a seriously zero plot, and suspect positive reviews. Horrible, but 3 stars for the nice bottom shots, decent lead-acting, and for the beautiful cinematography in places."
" Sea, Gull and Gal.
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,6,"A large part of me really and truly does resent that this movie got me to care about a seagull, a freakin' seagull! Then, to add insult to injury, that damn seagull was actually in the credits, and its nickname actually is Steven. It was part of the cast! It got a paycheck and everything!!! I mean, when it was trying to wake her up when those two surfers returned, and when it bit Nancy's finger... I swear, Steven won me over.And then that shark, what the hell was its problem? No, it was not the hook in its mouth. That shark had a grudge. Had it not died, I would've preferred this film issue a warrant of a arrest, for 3 counts of premeditated homicide, grievous bodily harm, attempted murder and hell, conspiracy to commit, between it and its maker.The Shallows was thoroughly enjoyable, and Blake's gracefulesque kind of sexiness made it that much easier to experience. The D.O.P was pretty stunning, the tension buildup was on beat and Blake's performance was good, but not her best. The whole shark constantly attacking plot line needed more meat to sink its teeth into however. This film turned a seagull into a dog and a shark into an irrational, deranged human with a loaded gun trying to rob a bank without an exit plan. Also, the manner in which that shark met its end felt a little too, kind of, a tad bit leaning towards, iffy. 6/10.P.S. Anna is a terrible friend though, apparently and evidently, who hopefully got crabs since poor Nancy had to chew on one."
" The Shallows is Pretty Visual
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,5,"Blake Lively is super pretty visual. I love Blake Lively. This movie has beautiful scenery. I love the shots of the rainforest with the sun shining through the canopy in the beginning and the shots of the ocean with the birds flying on the beach. Is this girl single? Forget about those rainforest and ocean shots, look at those Blake Lively in a bikini shots! I love those shots way better. This girl can not be single she's like the coolest chick ever. I don't know how smart she is, but still. Blake has the best smile man. I love Blake Lively. Did I say that already? Yeah, I did. The surfing scenes are great and really the best part of this dragging movie, outside of Blake Lively being in a bikini the whole way through. Did I say that already? Yeah, yeah I did. I love The Shallows. This girl needs a boyfriend, bad."
" Why
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,2,I've seen people erroneously compare this movie to Jaws. Oh the humanity.
" Decent enough.
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,6,"Since I am a person that is not a very big shark movies fan, it is understandable why I am not so impressed with this movie, but I also understand why other people are, that are shark movie fans. The movie is simple, intense, scary, emotional and it goes straight forward into the main thing. The shark looked extremely original and alive, especially when it was moving and opening her mouth with all those teeth. The only thing I am not very fond of is the pace, the scenery is pretty blank because you are seeing the same thing, same scene for an hour, but in the end it gets more interesting."
" Growling Shark
",2018-03-01 00:00:00,3,"Another dumb creature movie and a shark that growls, good thing it did not start barking !!"
" blake lively vs. the shark
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,9,"If you are in for a good movie and can stand a film with good suspense and where a person pretty much has to carry the bulk of the film, you will love this movie. It makes the most of a very limited cast and setting. It's a bit of a combination of Cujo and Jaws. Blake Lively goes for a surfing trip and gets trapped by a circling great white shark. First on a whale carcass, then on a rock, and then on a buoy. She also has to deal with a gash on her leg, high tide, and jellyfish. The movie manages to keep your suspense up as the shark circles. I like the final showdown, and her bird companion is very cute. *** out of ****"
" Arguably one of the best shark movies I've seen
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,6,"Despite not being a fan of shark movies (with the exception being 'Jaws', because come on, that's just a classic), I decided to give 'The Shallows' a try. Due to the disaster that most shark movies are, I didn't have very high expectations, but this movie took me by surprise. First of all, kudos to Blake Lively for her fantastic performance as Nancy. It's not easy to give a strong performance when you're stranded on a rock for 3/4 of the movie and it's also not easy when you're holding down an entire movie practically on your own, but Blake pulled it off. Although I've enjoyed her in 'The Age of Adaline' and 'Gossip Girl' in the past, I was pleasantly surprised at how well she did and think she deserves a lot of credit for what she achieved with this movie. The main issue with shark movies is that from the very beginning they're utterly predictable. You see the trailer, the title or the summary and you immediately know that it's going to involve a shark attack, what more is there to it? However, Nancy's resourceful and resilient personality is really what takes this movie to another level. Despite the hopelessness of the situation she was in she fought tooth and nail (excuse the pun) to survive. Every decision she made was practical and logical which made it very easy to root for her and want her to survive. Suspense was built up and the first half of the movie managed to keep my attention, but towards the end it drags unnecessarily and becomes frustrating. As a viewer it's obvious that she's going to survive so I don't see the point in dragging out the impending death of the shark. Despite the slow pace towards the end, the general pace throughout is good. My main issue with the movie is how unrealistic it is. Nancy is stranded on a rock in the middle of the ocean for what appears to be days, with multiple injuries, no food and no water. Being in the burning hot conditions during the day and freezing cold conditions at night, particularly with the blood loss she'd suffered, means it's doubtful she would've made it to the second day. Furthermore, the fact that she had enough energy and strength to repeatedly get into the water and swim and even take on the shark is ridiculous. With no food or water in her system she'd barely be able to stand let alone swim. Despite this, for a shark movie, 'The Shallows' is good. With any shark movie there's very little creative freedom or opportunity to create an intriguing and gripping story, so in that aspect, 'The Shallows' did the best it could with what it had. Blake's performance is definitely what takes this from a 4 star rating up to a 6 as I strongly believe she made this movie what it is."
" Cool premise but stupid
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,6,"Much like the ""da vinci code"" this movie could've been really good but... its stupid, and i feel like the director is trying to find an audience that is really stupid.
I dont mind inconsistencies if it is humorous but this movie takes itself serious.Big plus on the visuals though, nice butt, cool shark and fine waves;)"
" adventurous, thriller, and drama
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,9,"Shortly after the death of her mother, medical student Nancy Adams travels to a secluded beach in Mexico to surf, which is also the same beach her mother surfed at after finding out she was pregnant with Nancy many years before. Despite the danger of surfing alone, Nancy decides to soak up the sun and hit the waves. Suddenly, a great white shark attack, forcing her to swim to a giant rock for safety. Left injured and stranded 200 yards from shore, the frightened young woman must fight for her life as the deadly predator circles her in its feeding ground. I really like this movie because this movie has a good plot, actions, lighting, angles etc. I like the part when Nancy retrieves the GoPro camera helmet from one of the men when he tries to swim to the rock, and after another close attack from the shark records a message for her father and sister, and then throws the helmet toward the shore. The GoPro camera is found floating near the shore by Carlos' son, who brings his father to the beach. Carlos then finds Nancy floating in the shallows as his son runs for help. Overall this movie is very good the actors did a very good job with their roles and contribution. Also, the director was successful to help the actors act their roles better. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy thriller and action."
" Best seagull in a supporting role
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,7,"Less Jaws, more Gravity, with Blake Lively thinking her way out of a tight spot.I don't think the bikini bits are gratuitous. Watch any surfer film with women. It's just what they wear. Passes the Bechdel test.A shade under 90 minutes, which is remarkable these days."

While doing so she becomes the victim of a shark nuisance, injured and ""island hopping"" becoming a fighter and using her first aide training.Yup. That is it. The ending was WTF unrealistic, but clearly the highlight of the film, and don't do that it home because I doubt if it will work.Guide: No sex or nudity."
" horrible movie
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,1,"I won't say too much, but this movie was a joke. I m a huge fan of shark movies and this was a massive disappointment. Anyone who compares this to Jaws either worked in making this movie or have just posted fake reviews. First of all, the biggest flaw in this movie, why would the shark be interested in Blake Lively when there is a huge whale carcass around? And what boggles my mind, how does this girl survive days without any water or food, without even taking into account her multiple wounds from the jellyfish and the shark. Horrible film, leave this alone and watch Jaws again or even The Reef."
" An exceptional movie involving a hungry shark
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,7,"Plot is simple yet so catchy and interesting. After a few minutes you will start to care about the main protagonist, so much that you will cross your fingers hoping for the best. Everything (or almost everything) is going to feel realistic, and there is not anything wrong with the main antagonist ... it is totally well made. Great performance by Blake Lively (Nancy Adams) too. I will also mention the impressive landscapes because they literally left me speechless. I would have appreciated a more detailed background story but I will not complain as this movie was a really great experience. Watch it, especially if you are into suspense and sharks!"
" The Blonde Surfer Girl and the Shark
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,5,"Nancy Adams (Blake Lively), an athletic, likable, and lively blonde girl from Galveston, Texas, travels on a solo surfing vacation to Mexico to escape her studies, even though she only has one year left in medical school. Nancy wants some quiet time to think about whether or not she should quit her studies altogether. Her destination is a remote secret beach that was special to her late mother, who surfed there in her early pregnancy. She later died a cancer victim. While on the water, Nancy makes several acquaintances with two local Mexican surfers, of which one wears a GoPro camera on his helmet. Otherwise the beautiful beach is deserted. While Nancy paddles into shallow water waves, a great white shark (à la ""Jaws"") emerges without warning. It kills a whale, turns on her, and severely gashes her left thigh. Nancy finds a jagged rock, some 200 yards off shore, to escape the shark, and stops the bleeding by using parts of her bikini and surfing shirt. But that rock gets covered at high tide. While awaiting help, Nancy gives medical treatment to a white seagull with a dislocated wing; he keeps her company on the rock. She is hoping someone will come to the beach and calls for help. Instead one drunken dolt robs her backpack and cell phone on the beach and begins to walk off. Then he decides to paddle out to sea, but he is finished off by the shark. Later the two surfers return and try to rescue her, but being unaware of the man-eater, they too are victimized. In the denouement the movie takes a ridiculous turn as our heroine faces the shark in water with dangerous Portuguese Men-of-War and a buoy as her main defense. Hopefully the shark will not try to eat the metal parts of the flotation rigging. Did the embedded object in the shark make it so mean-spirited? Anyway, Nancy will need human help in the end.Jaume Collet-Serra directs a well-photographed and nicely crafted inspirational film about human survival. Nancy has courage and the mental smarts to persevere; she is plucky all right! While Ms. Lively's beauty is impressive, her acting skills are well-developed: she can certainly believably project her pain and anguish. Australian Isabella Nichols acts as Ms. Lively's surf double. But for some, the film may not be enough of a story to get folks excited."
" crap
",2017-10-12 00:00:00,2,"............Spoiler ALERT .............i don't know about what part should i talk about, her awful acting and the seagull better acting then her,about the Mexican drunk guy who is cut to the half by the shark and the next day morning he disappeared without trace,and nobody saw his body, about she almost killed her self to get the gopro for no reason , about her mother trash story . Well after 45 minutes i had to leave this suck movie because i cant stand ANY MORE.i wonder how this movie get over 6 rating and there is a really good movies didn't get the 5.5"
" not bad
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,7,"yer that was okay ,and yes from what i surmised the tide times were correct IE 5pm in evening =6-7 hours roughly to bottom of tide =1hr at bottom then 6-7 hrs to top again as her watch said 6am in morning ,so its near as dammit ,being a boat fisherman.besides the usual nit picks the film was OK i enjoyed it ,even the lighting at night was done OK so you could still see the film.it had a decent atmosphere ,and not to many soppy flashbacks of her mum ,being the reason she was there.its a tension builder and blake lively was great .its no jaws but well worthy of a look ,graphics were OK and film quality was spot on .factually probably a bit over the top ,and the end leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion ,but overall ,yep a decent film,not to deep just entertaining."
" visual high & sexy definition but rather simple ""story""
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,6,"Undoubtedly very appealing due the beautiful scenery, the nice camera shots, the awesome beach and of course the very sexy lead actress..Not only sexy, her acting was convincing enough to keep it suspenseful until the end. Really great performance, the movie could've failed if wrong casted.It's not a really original movie, the story is extremely simple but it works. It's entertaining, suspenseful, at times quite unrealistic but hey i don't expect it to be a documentary :)"
" Strong movie until the end
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,6,"Extremely strong build up to a depressing and disappointing ending is probably the best way to describe The Shallows. Most of you know, I don't give away the ending, so you won't be seeing me say what exactly happens, but just know that it fell extremely flat. Allow me to explain.The movie starts out with the happy setting of a young woman who recently lost her mother decides to go to her mother's favorite spot she had ever visited; that being a secluded beach in Mexico. Everything seems to be going well. She surfs with a couple of locals she meets there, has a heartwarming talk with her sister, not so heartwarming with her father, and does some more surfing.The problem comes when she paddles out to far to find a dead whale with bite in it that could fit a smart car. Once she realizes something is wrong it's already too late. The shark awaiting more prey comes in to attack.Now, don't get too far ahead of the story. It's not a shark movie. It is a movie about isolation and survival. Blake Lively gets stranded from shore a mere two hundred meters away from shore. That may not sound like much, but when you have a creature circling you that can swim thirty-five miles-per-hour it's a great distance.The movie really does give off the feeling of isolation in the sense that she talks to an injured seagull stranded on the rock with her. Then seeing what she has to go through by what she has to eat and the lack of water gives off the survival aspect.The ending, as I have said, is the worse part. Just that they completely changed the type of movie it was with the movie was enough, but there is more. Physical, she wouldn't have been able to do what she did in the end. She didn't have hardly anything to eat or drink and she lost quite a bit of blood. It would have been almost impossible for her to do what she did.The movie up to the last fifteen minutes (not including the credits of course) was good. Not great, but good enough to enjoy on a higher level. Giving us a survival movie with a shark as the reason to survive was the right move. It was just the end. Nothing more than that.Rating: 6 out of 10That's it for me folks."
" Complete crap
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,3,"This is a comedy - a fantasy comedy, with virtually no anchor in reality. I laughed from the discontinuity of the waves and vistas (islands one minute, open ocean the next) to a whale carcass resembling a pool toy (that didn't float with the tide) to a critter that didn't find free food in abundance preferable to molesting a skinny (really skinny) human at night, right down to a deeeep dive with no ear equalizing...a waste of time. Rent ""Open Water"" instead and be truly horrified."
" Very stupid
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,2,"The concept is a great white shark prefers the taste of a human than a dead whale... OK once you get your head around that, and the fact the great white can completely knock a whale carcass out of the water - then you must contend with who in their right mind would paddle their board out to a half eaten whale carcass in the middle of a shark infested bay..... Sorry, but these B grade movies that rely on absolute stupidity are not a story at all. They are simply darwinism"

" Fake looking CGI shark ruins potentially good shark thriller
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,5,"Okay shark thriller would have been better without the fake looking CGI shark. Blake Lively plays a lone vacationer in Mexico on a surfing trip and finds herself stalked by a shark after surfing alone one day. After the first bite chomps her board, she has to scramble onto whatever she can to keep away from the shark, which ranges from a dead whale carcass, to buoys, to rock outcroppings. The film is beautifully photographed, with some especially nice surf footage, and Lively manages to carry the film in what is essentially a one-woman show. However, it's the Sharknado-like overuse of CGI that ruins what might have been a more suspenseful of film. SPOILER ALERT! Seeing a flaming shark fly through the air really takes you out of any sort of realism and places this squarely in SyFy Channel movie levels of ridiculousness. I may have been harder on this film after having recently re-watched Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws,"" which famously showed very little of the shark, and as fake as the Jaws shark was, it was absolutely terrifying. Not as bad as I'd expected and is a respectable enough of little survival film, but it's nothing brilliant."
" THE SHALLOWS was a very interesting film to watch
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,8,"PROS: The best part of the movie was the tension. It was electric! You were set up in very basic, very improbable location (with very little recourses) and you were tasked with thinking creatively. That was the fun part. And even though there was so little that could actually take place because of the location, it didn't stop from building up the tension that was inevitably there. Another thing that critics disliked, but I really enjoyed, was the acting. BLAKE LIVELY took a difficult role and made it her own. There was so little room for creative character development, emotionally wise, but she did the best she could which I saw.CONS: The biggest problem I had with this movie was the faults with the conclusion of the film. The end was super abrupt, and it wasn't able to connect with the way the characters were set up before. Overall, the movie was great but the ending fell flat.www.chorror.com"
" Nancy on the rocks
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,3,"Mixes ""Jaws"" with ""127 Hours"". Nancy is going to surf to a deserted beach. After half an hour of some maneuvers of surf in slow motion she is attacked by a shark. Somehow she manages to climb a rock where she's joined by a seagull that has also suffered a blow from the shark. The rest of the film is Nancy on the rocks making improvised band aids and several attempts to call out for help that, very predictably, all turn out fruitless. Towards the end of the film she can swim to a signaling float with the increasingly furious shark acquiring super powers that it can even eat the steel from which the float is made. Nancy is able to escape in such a miraculous and unrealistic way that it can only be seen to be believed - or not! On a scale of 1 to 10, 3 points. 1 point I only give movies that I really hate; as it is not quite the case, 2 points; and an extra point for the seagull that has an excellent performance ;)"
" Unrealistic
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,2,"First, what's a while herd of dolphins doing in 'the shallows' in a cove next to a beach? Second, they're so animated it's a joke; they don't look real at all. Third,--are you kidding me??? The shark's killed a humpback whale that's unrealistically still floating and it's not even interested in eating it. It's apparently more interested in surfers. It even gets impatient with Blake Lively sitting on it for awhile and takes the effort to ram into it to knock her off. I mean, if I were a shark: the whale I've just made a rotting carcass out of (the humongous mass of sea flesh) that I can apparently have to myself since there aren't any other sharks around or more work and stalking for humans I shouldn't be interested in the taste of, one of whom is obviously really hard to catch anyway? Wild animals don't kill just to kill. And what's with it having gotten stuck on the left side of its jaw? Nothing came off that, so it didn't have any relevance."
" Why only 6.7/10 on IMDb?
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,10,"I managed to watch The Shallows on a flight, and it's a most impressive movie. I can't believe that it has only 6.7/10 on IMDb! Anyway, this is a taut thriller (filmed on Lord Howe Island in Australia) and it never lets you go. Sully the Seagull is amazing, and so of course is Blake Lively big time. There was so much suspense and the ending was so moving. The Shallows is an unforgettable movie, and kudos to the director and the production team."
" Rating: B-
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,6,"Is it the best shark movie since Jaws? Yes ... and no. The Shallows is, in my opinion, the best ""shark-movie"" that I've seen since the one directed by the great Steven Spielberg! However, that's not saying much since there aren't any decent movies involving sharks since then. It has some great exciting details, but some other big issues that I'm going to discuss below.I need to begin with Blake Lively. She has one of her best (if not the best) performances in this film and she needed to be at the top of her game since she was basically the only human character that mattered. She was able to transmit all of the emotions that one would feel in a situation like that (fear, pain, vulnerability) and, most importantly, she made me care for her. In a contained movie like this, with only one character to worry about, if the audience member doesn't feel like the protagonist is human enough, then the whole thing crumbles. Not in this case, she's the main reason why I actually enjoyed this movie.The CGI shark is amazing, really well defined, as well as the rest of the environment. Jaume Collet-Serra could have done a better job. He tries to elevate the excitement of this film to a certain level that he's never able to reach due to a series of issues, but it's still exciting enough for me to be entertained. Just not as much as I was expecting.There are some minor issues that bothered me a little, like the constant advertising to go-pros or even the slow first act (in a movie like this, we just want it to get to the shark attack instantly), but never at an annoying level. The thing that really messed up the movie and brought its excitement way down was the conflicting tones throughout it. The background music that was chosen to support certain scenes were incredibly off. There are some really serious, tense and emotional scenes with more intense music, but the director was never able to maintain that level of thrill and intensity. That's, by far, my major problem with this film.There's one other issue that, if I have to describe it in one word, it has to be ""stupid"". Without spoiling anything, there's this question that keeps being asked throughout the whole film, again and again, in order to create something that can draw us more close to the story and be more captivated ... And then, it just forgets it. It literally drops it and the movie ends without answering that question, leaving me frustrated instead of relieved or ... ""complete"". I think you know what I'm talking about.Still, The Shallows is an entertaining movie ... to watch at home. It's one of those movies to watch on holidays with some friends and family when there's nothing decent on TV. Blake Lively is amazing and there are some great exciting scenes, even if they're brought down by some not-that-good directing.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" I feel dumber now
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,3,"Weeeeell... 1) Apparently there is a great cell coverage at the unknown beach in Mexico. 2) A lot, I mean A LOT, unnecessary shots of waves, sea, surfers, protagonist butt and boobs. 3) A shark, who has a mentality of vengeful human, ignoring huge whale carcass nearby and wasting its energy on trying to CRAWL on the rock to hunt a human. No, predators, sharks, do not do that. 4) Huge great white jaws, which can demolish a metal buoy later, leave just a minor flesh wound on woman's leg. 5) Experienced surfers ignore shark warning from a wounded protagonist on a rock. 6) A drunk puts a cell phone in his pants and... immediately goes swimming in those pants. 7) Tides come several times during 24 hours. Yeap, who needs science. 8) Protagonist is some kind of superhuman being. Blood loss for two days? Shark bite? Coral wounds? Jellyfish sting? Dehydration? Heatstroke? She can still beat great white shark in swimming."
" Captivating
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,7,"At first i thought it going to be a boring movie after reading all the negative reviews. After watching, i was pleasantly surprised. I love the special effects especially of the big white shark , the crystal clear water , the jelly fish and etc. The movie was well paced, i wasn't bored even for a single second even though 80% of screen time is only with blake lively and the bird. And it ended well with an unexpected climax albeit a little far fetched.i will probably watch it again.7/10.Definitely watchable if you don't get your expectations too high."
" Decently good movie with lots of flaws!
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,6,"I gave this 6 stars because the acting was good, the story was good, the cinematography was excellent, the waves were pristine, the flaws were easily overlooked, etc. The story was exaggerated of course for the horror aspect. The unreal part of this is the only part that gives it the horror aspect (the psycho shark, lol). Otherwise, it's more like a 'thriller/suspense' movie, IMHO. This movie, in a way, reminded me a small bit of the 'Soul Surfer' movie without the relentless shark coming back for more like in the movie 'Jaws'. 'Soul Surfer' was a one-time shark bite, but it was based on a real story and a fight to return to surfing. It had way more of a plot and it wasn't horror. Still, this movie had a decent premise for a horror genre. It's a B- rated flick, done somewhat well. Geez, don't be so hard on it. If you want to watch something to put you on the edge of your seat a bit or some nail-biting anticipations, then give this a shot. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Formulate your own opinions. I don't embellish, I just give you what I believe is my honest take."
" Ha Ha Ha Ha
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,3,"That's pretty much all I can say. I'm very glad the bird lived butHA HA HA HAWhat a movie. Blake Lively did as good of a job as anyone could do in this role so my criticism does not lie with her. The story was really, really bad. I laughed a lot. My friend, however, really liked the movie so I bumped my rating from a 2 to a 3."
" Beautiful location, fun implausibilities 'let's all drink' (water!) shark genre
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,5,"Just had to add in this review because of 'tenuous' associations with surfing: So: first, this should get high (tide?!) marks just for the location and stupendous scenery scouted and scooped - (secluded, world heritage national park Lord Howe island = kudos to location manager Duncan Jones as it's ""the heart and soul of the film'"") - and truly, it's gorgeous: especially so in the aerial end credits; plus with some nice, cool surfing shots (sorta like much earlier 'Crystal Voyager'). Pity then that the stunt-woman(women?) - Isabella Nicols as 'Nancy' (Blake Lively's character) as credited, but also a Kelly Richardson as her 'stunt double' - so whomever did all the surfing shots is not more highlighted e.g. in DVD issue, no extra considered worthy on her/them from the makers, in this rather germane aspect to the movie.And so indeed, it is nicely filmed: but otherwise, oh, those scriptwriters (just A. Jaswinski?)! Either testing our credulity (the suspension of disbelief!) to the max or just never taken any study course on plot holes, implausibilities or whatever? They infest this film more than critters would do the huge hulk of the supposedly stranded deceased whale that sets the conceit of this 'tale' all off ..So, IN PLOT SPOILERS WARNING HERE of the suspensions of disbelief you shall need to enjoy this offering, here we go: to that whale then; so such huge creature would be just beyond the surf and not noticed at all? Neither smell, nor blood, nor seagulls gathered around, let lone enormous (female!) shark about it? OK: With such a huge feast available to it, this (female!) killer instinct shark would still prefer to suddenly hunt humans (it's already ominously hinted at in the swell of one wave crest BL surfs - but somehow still never breaches that wave ) OK: That said (female - against female, note= geddit? e.g. á la Aliens?) shark would still be driven to instead prefer feed (prey) upon so surfing fit, lithe (=damn skinny!) prey: OK: Shark so huge (it's female, right = so even huger) that it can not only chomp in half a wading guy, entirely consume two (male) surfers, it's teeth ('jaws') chew away at a metal buoy, BUT, leaves merely a flesh wound, no more than almost scratch on the heroine: OK: A cove that has surfing high waves, but that to the (handy convenient) rock, on which on the whole, the water merely laps at and over: OK: that the tide, a constantly referred to plot device to the film, seems to not rise consistently (believably) - indeed, actually, if almost at all: OK: self first aid stitching with an ostensibly pretty UNsharp 'earring' (or was it necklace) would not put you in some form of bleed out shock: OK: That your wet-suit material is so flimsy, can be ripped (accurately, too) by your very own pearly white teeth - BUT then still have enough tension to make a form of tourniquet, as having previously been your arm piece, but can now 'stretch' over your thigh: OK: Said type of injury would still not impede your determined swim capabilities over several yards (just incidentally constantly trailing blood, whilst the shark blithely circles ...): OK: That in the time stranded on rock - at least two days? - first under cloudless day scorching sun, then associated drop in temperature cold night, still no hint of hypothermia nor dehydration, to that having been in the (salty?) sea, could so survive so feistily with not a drop of fresh water ... OK: That jellyfish not only suddenly turn up in a surfing cove, but in any case localised to (just?) between a rock and a (hard!) buoy place, but that in swimming through, only ONE would sting, and that in any case, is bearable enough to forget about afterwards (I've read that jellyfish stings are so excruciating that even after painkillers those affected can still plead to have the stung area cut off!), and - yes, in any case - when stung, causing you to scream underwater, still does not cause inrush of water to drowning proportions ... OK: that a buoy is in a cove for some reason (yes, I know: it warns of the rocks: right!), so that it has a distress flare gun on it (it's in a cove - within sight of the shore !): OK: that said flares, once wetted, will still function: OK: that in your cleverly arranged despatch of predator shark depends on that you could not only out-swim but out-dive such a streamlined sea creature .. (yes, I know: it involves a momentum weight chain - so darned easy to hang onto !)OK: and .. well, I could go on, but please, go enjoy to spot ya own, as note, no mention of seagull veterinarian skills that would not either kill or cause flight of  (ya just gotta 'see' that one.) All to which make this a super 'drinking' film: have a sip of unsalinated water for every implausibility you spot :-) coz, on the whole, I still found this quite enjoyable - nowhere near trash - although totally unfair on the true nature of sharks, but come on, it's a movie 'tale' ain't it? e.g. initial surfing scenes with great sound design and effects, too. Although, perhaps that's because I'm NOT a surfer, but know someone who is, and could be a dead ringer for gorgeous BL."
" Just a good shark movie
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,7,"If you start this movie and expect to be blown away and horrified you will be disappointed. This movie is in my opinion by far not a bad movie, the effects are great, the acting is good and the story is simple, yet kind of horrifying.The main actress Blake Lively who plays the surfer Nancy plays 90 procent of this movie alone and does a very great job, you really believe the desperate situation she is going through.The overall story and especially the ending is in my opinion very disappointing but for a 86 minutes movie you can watch it and not get annoyed with it.I recommend this movie if you like sharks, a little bit of horror and really cool special effects.7/10"
" Unbelievable Horsecrap
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,2,"I'm willing to suspend belief while watching a B-Movie with an absurd and implausible screenplay, but this one went so far beyond what a movie can get away with while still taking itself seriously, that I'm stunned it wasn't universally panned.Blake lively cops a shark bite and spends the movie stranded on a rock. The main problem? That same shark, which for some reason was portrayed as being maybe 12 feet long when it gave her the equivalent of a nip, suddenly turns into a giant megalodon capable of flipping a large whale carcass, tearing 3 other people in half like they were bite-sized nibbles, literally sawing through and shredding the metal framework of a buoy as if it were butter before the laugh-out-loud moment at the climax where it swims with the momentum of a steam train into the ocean floor.There are a myriad of other problems, such as when they try to posit that the shark has an aversion to jellyfish, which sharks don't. Unless they got stinging tendrils directly in their eye, which would be easily avoided thanks to the membranes that cover and protect their eyes, the shark wouldn't even feel a jellyfish nor be phased by some stinging coral. And that's the least of the scientifically inaccurate liberties the movie took.It's taken decades for the general public to overcome the misconceptions about sharks created by films like Jaws, then this absolute turd of a movie comes along and tries to portray one as a vengeful monster that's been wronged by humans (a hook hanging out of it's mouth) and is now on a single-minded vendetta to stalk and kill people for the sport of it.The script is a dud, with some cringey 'mom died so daughter goes in search of the spirit of adventure at some beach the mom loved to pay homage while making a life decision about whether or not to be a doctor' unnecessarily crammed in there to try to lend emotional gravity where there is none. The only redeeming feature is Steven Seagull. He's the only character the audience could be reasonably expected to invest and care in. From the constant idiocy of the protagonist, to the idiocy of the shark's victims, to the CPR-ignorant savior; the movie is easily one of the worst films I've seen in years. At least Sharknado had the decency to not take itself seriously. This movie tries it's best to be a suspenseful thriller but ends up falling into the category of ""so bad it's not good or bad, just a waste of a budget and the audience's time"".Avoid this steamer like you would a rotting whale carcass."
" Another middle finger to the audience from the CGI industry
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,6,"I'll start with the good points on this ""not bad but not great"" shark flick. The choice of the gorgeous Lord Howe Island as the idyllic film location was inspired. And Blake Lively puts in a decent performance as medical student / surfer dude Nancy Adams, leaving her studies behind for some ill-fated thrill-seeking.The movie also features several decent early scenes, and camera-work which can at times be very creative, with lots of clever shots of breaking waves, and mobile phone conversations etc etc.It's only fair to say however that that same camera-work frequently lingers voyeuristically over Lively's bikini-clad ass and boobs, making me realise that at 45 years of age, I am probably 2 or 3 times older than this film's main target audience.And after several too many arty slow-mo music scenes at the beach, I found myself googling the director to see if his background was in making popular music videos (it was).But a shark film will ultimately live and die on it's beastie, and although this one SOMETIMES looks good, sadly it's creators just can't resist going over the top in key moments. For you see, our critter is able to barge entire whales out the way and send them flying! Furthermore it has 1000 scars on it's body, (cos, you know, normal great whites just aren't scary enough are they?) And without giving too much away, the climax of the film features insultingly poor underwater physics and CGI, and it undoes a lot of the goodwill that the film built up earlier.The main frustration then, is that horror movie makers have been told ad infinitum that something evil, glimpsed fleetingly in murky darkness, is always more terrifyingly believable than an entire CGI beast pasted slap-bang in the middle of the screen on a clear Summer's day. Yet they seem completely unwilling to listen or care. For this reason I can only take this film as yet another extended middle finger to the audience from the special effects industry.So then, in conclusion; rank this movie below ""Jaws"" (obviously), and also some way below the pleasing and underrated 2010 shark flick ""The Reef"" (note: real shark footage was nearly always used!). But definitely rank it ABOVE the ludicrously dumb CGI-fest that was ""Deep Blue Sea""."
" An exciting shark thriller!
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,9,"This is an entertaining and exciting thriller starring Blake Lively as surfer Nancy, who gets injured by a Great White Shark and temporary seek refuge on a small island. From there, her test of survival becomes her biggest challenge.There's plenty of thrills in the movie that will keep you at the edge-of-your-seat from start to finish. You could feel Nancy's pain as she deals with her injury and her determination as she makes all kind of enduring attempts to survive. The lingering shark circling in the waters around her gives the dramatic mood added suspense, and the injured seagull marooned with Nancy on the island gives the film some added lightheartedness.The visual effects were great as it paints a picture of a beach out in the middle of nowhere and isolation, and the CGI-shark was actually realistic-looking.Though the shark is only on screen for a few minutes, its presence is felt throughout the film, while Nancy's riveting quest for survival is the highlight of the film. Overall, an exciting movie! Grade A"
" Pretty bad
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,3,"A film that is centric around displaying Blake Lively as an object to be admired. She doesn't even zip up her wetsuit all the way(making it obsolete) so she can show her cleavage. This film portrays women in a very poor light. One big question: How does she get a ride to this beach from a man who she doesn't know, and she doesn't even know the name of the beach? The music score is gratuitous and attempts to transform paddling out past a break into climbing up the face of a ravine. The writing is godawful mix of weak surf slang (tubes and gnarly) and Spanish, to which she has an extremely tenuous grasp (making the Spanish pointless. The worst part has to be the on-screen cell phone images of facetimes, texts, and pictures. This seems to be some new trendy way of filmmaking which I find repugnant. Even the initial driver has to remind her to put her phone down and enjoy the view which she has traveled to see. Want a good shark movie? I recommend The Reef."
" Simple shark movie but a good way to kill some time
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,7,"The concept of this movie is incredibly simple: a surfer on a secluded beach gets attacked by a shark and has to survive stranded on a small rock poking out of the water. With a simple concept like that you can't really expect much in terms of dialog, characters or deeper meanings, it's meant to be a way to kill some time and for what it is I think it's well made. By limiting the setting to that one small rock island, just a few hundred meters from the safety of the beach; coupled with plenty of areal shots to show off exactly how small that rock is, hammers home the isolation and exposed position of the main character. Add a shark set on taking revenge on humans and the fact that the main character has been seriously wounded serves to build up tension towards the action sequences. Pacing is good too with some calmer moments to let the audience breathe between action scenes. Sure, some elements of the movie are rather unrealistic but that's fine because they get a reasonable explanation within the movie universe. After seeing various shark related B-movies like Sand Shark or Sharktopus, it's nice to see one where the movie makers have actually put a bit of thought and effort into it. If you have a bit of time on your hands, definitely check this out, it's a good thrill ride."
" Decent shark film
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,7,"A US surfer gets stuck in the shallows hunted by a great white shark. There is only so much you can do with a shark movie but this still manages to entertain despite the relative predictability of it. It's well filmed and makes the most of a beautiful setting. There is some decent tension built up and some predictably bloody deaths. There are some nice touches done with the local wildlife of jellyfish,dolphins and gulls which all helps you keep your interest and makes you forget you've seen this all before. This is an entertaining and decent entry into the shark movie genre and worth watching with a couple of beers on a Saturday night."
" Not my favorite but i've seen worse
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,6,"It was an OK movie. There were some parts of the movie I really liked, but there were also some parts that I didn't understand and that I didn't like. Some things that I really liked about this movie is how good the acting was, also how real everything looked. The shark and the bird look like real animals. Sometimes in movies it's very obvious that there is a green screen, but the technology here was just amazing. I was pretty entertained throughout the whole movie because of the shark. It was so ridiculous you just kept wondering what insane things it was going to do next. I'm no shark expert, but i'm pretty sure sharks don't jump onto little rock islands, jump out of the water to bite the top of a buoy to get the girl into the water, or run into a dying whale a couple of times to knock the girl off into the water so it could eat her. Why would a shark spend so much time stalking a girl to eat when there was a fresh whale carcass just a couple of yards away they it could eat with no effort. Another thing I didn't like about the movie is how predictable it was for me. Every time I saw a new person on the beach, I knew they were going to get into the water and die. I also knew that the main character, Nancy, wasn't going to die. I knew this because there really weren't any other main characters in the movie so how would they finish the movie if she was dead? I think one of the biggest things I took from this movie, is don't go places alone. Bad things always happen when you go out on big adventures alone. If you ever get into trouble like Nancy did and you have someone with you, you can get help faster. So always travel with a buddy."
" Insufferable
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,1,"I admit, I have not seen the entire film. I stopped when that fat guy swam out of the water, revealing he only had half his body, while the rest apparently fell off while he was crawling on the beach. Of course, we can only guess what happened to him, because the editor or director thought the focal point of that scene was the woman's reaction. How misguided. And how silly to expect a guy who is missing everything below his lungs to be crawling around? This scene was too much for me to swallow, even with all the expectations seriously lowered. It was just painful to watch, like someone constantly hitting you in the face. Don't watch this crap, because the screenplay, the direction, and the editing are abysmally bad. The result is that suspense is minimal, the audience ends up being bored, and ultimately the viewer becomes alienated due to the sheer amount of nonsense one is expected to go along with."
" Time and tide.....
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,1,"I only joined IMDb to I could review this complete turkey (OK, wrong animal!) of a movie.I'm from the coast, I know how the tide works, obviously the director doesn't.The tide comes in, the tide goes out on a rather regular basis, it doesn't stay at low tide for a day and a half before suddenly becoming high tide again.God, this movie was awful, truly, truly awful. I'd never heard of the lead ""actress"" before, Look Lively or what-ever her name was but when you get out-acted by a seagull, perhaps movies aren't for you, even the dead whale was better.Did I say it was awful.Did say the director didn't understand how tides work. And don't even get me started on how one minute it would be flat calm, the next crashing rolling surf.This movie sucked - big time!"
" Surf babe vs big fish.
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,6,"Nancy (Blake Lively) hitches a lift to a remote beach paradise in Mexico to surf the gnarly waves, unaware that the waters are the feeding ground for a bloody big and very hungry shark. As she is waiting to catch one last ride, the shark knocks her into the water and has a little nibble on her leg (given the size of the shark, I'd say that she is lucky she wasn't swallowed whole). Bleeding, Nancy is able to climb to safety, first on the carcass of a dead whale, and then onto some rocks, but trapped 200 metres from the shore, can she make it back to dry land without becoming fish food?The best shark film since Jaws? No, not by a long chalk. There's too much pointless surfing at beginning, too much cell phone messaging (great connection considering the remoteness of Nancy's location), too much of very little happening on the rock, too many plot contrivances (necklace, jellyfish, shark tooth, flare gun) and an ending that really stretches plausibility. The film does, however, benefit from a strong central performance from Lively, some lovely cinematography (of both the beach and the star's body), and one or two well-handled moments of tension by director Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax and Orphan). As for the shark, it looks convincing when it's in the water, but the CGI isn't quite up to par once the fish decides to leap out of the water to chew on a metal buoy (don't ask).Jaws is still the best shark film ever made, and there are plenty better than The Shallows, but, hey, I didn't hate it. Which is something, I suppose.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb."
" I'm not going in the water again!!
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"As someone who has a huge fear of open water I always watch this kind of film with a sunken feeling, the rest for me is always how realistic the film is, the more silly and ridiculous the more I unwind and watch more easily. This had me on edge for the full duration, a true sense of terror as soon as the action got going. At no point did the film feel predictable, nor could you possibly know what was coming next.Not much in terms of a cast, indeed Nancy has pretty much the entire screen time, apart from a very tame seagull. Blake Lively is excellent throughout.The scenery of this film is breathtaking, such an exquisite place, you cannot help but be blown away by the visuals, fabulous camera work, and really good special effects, it is a visual treat.I hated the music, way too heavy for the film, and I didn't like the way the way the conversations popped up on screen either, minor faults though.If you're like me and your heart sinks at the thought of being abandoned in open water then I can assure you this film will leave you with one hell of an uncomfortable feeling. This is very, very good 8/10"
" Not just another shark film
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,10,"Just watched The Shallows and I'm in love. This was a creative survival film, I highly recommend watching it. The thriller aspect was well done, the attacks and ""gore"" was tasteful, the make up team was magnificent as well as the amount of research done on the film. The CGI shark is BEAUTIFUL its hard to believe she's not real. Blake Lively deserves an award for her performance, her acting was was natural, compassionate and realistic and made me want to see her character triumph. Not only was the film well written it was cinematically gorgeous. Full of creativity, beauty and thrill this film as become one of my new favorites. It's not ""just another Shark movie."""
" Just as ridiculous as everyone else says! Don't waste your time.
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,4,"Gorgeous beach, good acting. But I've watched Shark Week DVDs a gazillion times. I wrote down the survivors' names and read their real accounts. I've read Rodney Fox's story many times. I've watched real documentaries. The behavior of the fictional shark is ridiculous in the face of current knowledge. When Jaws came out, we didn't know any better. But now we do.And anyhow, it's not real smart to go swimming/snorkeling/diving/surfing by yourself, so i didn't have much sympathy for the main character. If you want to hear some scary, true stories, read Peter Benchley's non fictional Shark Trouble or the book called Surfing's Greatest Misadventures. Or read survivor testimony of the USS Indianapolis. Or Ray Boundy, Rodney Fox, etc."
" I enjoyed it........
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,8,"Reading IMDb reviews a lot, it seems a lot of people complain about the movie being ""unrealistic."" To me, because it's a movie, I don't see how it matters. Movies require unrealistic things that would probably not happen in real life in order to be entertaining. The shark attack in the beginning where it bit her leg and we saw a plethora of blood was not realistic because no one could survive such a attack like that. However, if the shark had eaten here there and then, there would be no movie. I enjoyed this movie, Black Lively's performance was great. Best shark movie I have seen, yes, I think Jaws was highly overrated. 8.5/10"
" Fabulous
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"One of the best, most riveting movies I've ever seen. You will be hanging onto the edge of your seat the entire time. The acting is amazing, the music is great, and the scenery and camera work are right on target. I have watched this several times now, and will no doubt watch it again. If you don't like intense movies, don't watch this! (="
" Gripping and visually stunning
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,8,"I almost didn't watch this movie due to the negative comments on here. So glad I did. I now realise the majority of negative reviews are completely dull, nit picking and also so snobby. Are you really watching a shark movie imagining a groundbreaking, life affirming film that also manages to show shark attacks as accurate reality? Most negatives are about the unrealistic nature of the shark, and poor use of CGI. Perhaps in the final part of the film, this is true. However the tension was so well developed by then it doesn't matter, you see the actual shark fleetingly and in very fast paced scenes so whoever really has time to pause the movie, get your magnifying glass out for a close inspection and dwell on this has to much time on their hands. The shots of the ocean, beach and surfing are utterly stunning, combined with a great soundtrack. Blake Is surprisingly good and more than able to command your attention, being on screen for 95% of the movie, for the duration. The tension is well portrayed as you will be going through various scenarios/outcomes/plans yourself in your own head, and her actions are all cleverly thought out- seeing as she has more then enough time on your hands, being stranded on a rock, is more than plausible. The review under this slated the movie for showing her resorting to eating a crab! Oh my, shock horror! Well actually- she spat the crab out to feed the seagull. And YES, you would be more than hungry, lying in full beam of the sun, injured, already having surfed all day and swam for your life, so to criticise this is ridiculous. Give it a try, Im glad I did."
" bad movie but terrible ending
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,2,"just utter garbage ending. Maybe asking anyone with more than basic knowledge about sharks would have resulted in more realism I get why people like this it is tense but the utter dis-regard of realism in a movie based in the real world really put me off especially in the end. Jaws made the shark believable but this film didn't really get there for me so when the climax came and the shark seemed to plan ahead it felt very strange and then the very end was so anti-climactic I just felt like making an IMDb account just to tell people that this is a steaming pile of garbage. on the plus side Blake lively made it bearable... barely, I hope to see her in better movies in the future."
" Open Jaws
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,5,"Blake Lively plays Nancy, a medical student taking time off from her studies and plans to go to a secluded beach in Mexico with a pal for some surfing. Let down by her friend she heads alone hoping for a period of self reflection as this was the beach her now deceased mother once visited when she was young.While she is surfing alone she is attacked by a large shark. Injured, bleeding she is stranded on a rock. She looks for help but no one is about, her medical skills are used to patch herself up the best she can and she realises that she is only safe on the rock as it is low tide. As the tide rises, she needs to get to safety, but the shark is circling round. Nancy needs to somehow outwit the shark.This is really a low budget B movie. The CGI is ordinary and the story is preposterous. Nancy is in a remote location but she gets excellent wifi and a mobile phone signal.The shark is of course demented, hell bent in gobbling up Nancy when their are other food sources about (maybe he saw her performance in Savages!)"
" The Shallows is a masterpiece in the genre after a long time and a must watch with nail biting screenplay,stunning visuals and powerful Lively.
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,9,"The Shallows (2016): In the time where even 2 headed and 3 headed sharks are introduced in films,who would expect a masterpiece in killer shark genre.But The Shallows proved us wrong and remains as a cult classic in the genre after Jaws.While every B budget maker is making sharks attack using tornadoes,Jaume Collet-Serra cleverly made a laughable genre into a thrilling ride with medium budget and best output.Plot:A medical student, Nancy (Blake Lively), takes some time off from her studies and heads to a secluded beach in Mexico to surf. While surfing she is attacked by a large shark, leaving her injured and stranded on a rock not too far out to sea. What follows is a battle of wits and wills between her and the shark.Plus Points:1)Screenplay and Direction: The Shallows starts as an ordinary shark film beginning where a girl goes to a beach and starts surfing.Nothing happens at that time except stunning VFX and cinematography but once Nancy finds carcass of whale,things take a surprise turn and then begins a thrilling ride which last for another 70 mins.Jaume Collet Serra wrote a taut screenplay with nail biting scenes.After a long time ,we are finally afraid of sharks instead of laughing at them.The film takes Olympic-level pleasure in watching her swimming, leaping, fighting, scrambling, enduring – ensure every attack and counterattack convulses and grips.Climax is awesome and really deserves applause for the scene with jellyfish.2)Cinematography: Flavio Labiano-I don't know this guy but now I am a huge fan of him.Entire shots of ocean and surfing are beautifully shot and I have ever seen an ocean so lovely and deadly at the same time.Even the little coral reef where Nancy gets stranded is amazingly shot by clearly showing the suffocating area.Underwater shots are plausible.3)VFX: At first the VFX of tides looked average but once the action began,entire VFX rose up to high level.There is a shot where Nancy surfs over a big wave and a sharks lurks behind the wave.That shot is one of the best scariest idea of all time.Shark looked real and the cuttings,blood look is shocking.Climax scene with jellyfishes is awesome and visually stunning.4)Sound design: Sound design is spine-bucklingly vivid,especially when Lively suddenly gets ragged into water her breathing sound is captured splendidly well.5)Blake Lively: Last but not least,Blake Lively carries and keeps the horror survival thriller afloat and captivating by vigorously selling just how dire and terrifying her situation is, while still remaining strong, composed and compassionate.Her perfect body in bikini may be a eye feast at beginning but once the shark attacks,we can only see her struggle.So,The Shallows is a masterpiece in the genre after a long time and a must watch with nail biting screenplay,stunning visuals and powerful Lively.My rating 8.5/10"
" Gripping, intriguing survival drama
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,7,"A medical student, Nancy, takes some time off from her studies and heads to a secluded beach in Mexico to surf. While surfing she is attacked by a large shark, leaving her injured and stranded on a rock not too far out to sea. What follows is a battle of wits and wills between her and the shark.Quite a basic plot line, yet filled with much intrigue and tension. Initially reminded me of Open Water, but follows a different course, from a point. While both have a survival vs sharks central plot, Open Water had much more character depth, adding another dimension to the movie. The Shallows is purely about survival, and what that entails."
" The shallows will trill u but not in Real Mex...
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,10,This movie is sexy and beautiful film great to rent an Owen in 4K it has emotion and horror action this will be a modern version of Jaws per say this will keep you interested from begging to end and on the verge of your seat; the negative thing abut the movie is the false advertisement that they give this was sadly not filmed in Mexico 🇲🇽 but despite that the movie is good. Juggalos.
" What a waste of time
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,2,"I only gave it 2 stars because of the Steven Seagull and some of the pictures. The biggest shallow of the movie is in its plot. It is boring, predictable and unbelievably kitsch. The amount of nonsense is just overwhelming to the point where it unintentionally becomes a comedy."
" Great shark movie
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,10,"Exactly what it was supposed to be.A bit formulaic, but really what can one do with a shark?Blake Lively was amazing. If nothing else, you should watch this for her Riply-esque performance and strength in the face of complete torment and almost certain death.If you don't know what that means, you should not be reading movie reviews.I'd recommend this movie to any adult who likes the suspense/horror genre. Good watch."
" Ultimately an Empty Film From Start to Finish
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,4,"""The Shallows"" is not trying to be an Academy Award nominee in any way, shape or form. It's basically a popcorn film with no real plot, little dialogue and no true reward for the viewer. It is generally entertaining but offers nothing more than passing time for about 70 minutes until we have something better to do. Blake Lively is the star along side a CGI shark and sea gull. She performs admirably with material that does not provide much with which to work. The viewer truly has to suspend disbelief in this film, as the antics of the shark far surpass what we've seen in other shark movies other than those on SyFy. This shark has a vendetta against Ms. Lively like we've never seen. Maybe he's trying to get back at her for that ""Gossip Girl"" deal. The shark's behavior becomes so ridiculous that the movie takes on the feeling of a glorified cartoon after a while. In the end, the film is not boring, especially if one enjoys a scantily clad Blake Lively, but it's also not very good at all. When the final credits roll, we're left to wonder what happened here."
" A good flick about survival
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,7,"Firstly, the movie star by the journey of 1 American girl travel to the tropical island which have a fantastic view and great landscape ( filmed mostly in Australia ). That is the first success of the film by enchant the audience with beautiful beach, awesome waves challenge the 3 skilled suffers, our main female character-Blake Lively also has a nice blonde hair and charming body The story goes on, memories about Nancy's mother made her to go further to catch the final wave of the day. The first victim of the great white shark was a old whale and then Nancy became the moving target by gone into the hunting territory of it. The shark attacked, Nancy got hurt and stranded on a small rock. Wounded, hopeless by every attempt to get- off the rock, trying for help or warning is useless , one by one: the drunk man, the 2 suffers became the bait of the shark. Night to day, from the low tide to high tide there are only her, the seagull and the shark waiting out there. Desperately, she record all her final words to her younger sister and father by a GoPro camera and then thrown it awayThe cat & mouse game finally end with the well- done script which reminds me how the Rogue (2007) end and I assumed that it definitely pleased the audience . Last but not least, the song Bird set free by Sia is a perfect way for the ending, I really like it! Nancy got recovered; once again came to the beach but this time with her sister & papa. Nancy's mother might passed away but Nancy always gave her the most strongest love."
" No Surprises, But Decent Enough
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"There is nothing about ""The Shallows"" that makes it a poor film. It has wonderful visuals, a decent plot, and a lot of excitement all-around. However, it also just happens to be one of those films where there are no surprises, and it helps to have a certain life-experience background to really ""get into it"".For a basic plot summary, ""The Shallows"" sees Nancy (Blake Lively) visiting an exotic, super- secret beach that her now-deceased mother once frequented. Stood up by a hungover gal pal, Nancy decides to go it alone for a day of surfing and self-reflection. On the last tide of the day, however, Nancy is visited by a surprise visitor from the deep, trapping her out at sea.As I said, this film has enough things going for it that it never is really boring. Lively is perfect for this leading role, and the visuals are inventive/exciting. There is even a plot that makes sense and is semi-realistic (i.e. not so far-fetched to have you rolling your eyes).The problem with ""The Shallows"" (keeping it from being a really good movie) is two-fold:1. There are absolutely no surprises in the film. If you've seen the trailer, you know pretty much exactly what will happen. It falls into a pretty defined genre, and plays out just like one would expected it too.2. Because of point #1, you really need to take your own experiences into this film to ""get into it"" (as the film itself won't create them for you). More to the point, if you can really relate to surfing and other oceanic pursuits you'll be sucked in much more than others, as the film doesn't quite do a good enough job of putting in other character drama (a side plot of Nancy having dropped out of medical school falls almost completely flat).Someday, Blake Lively will be fortunate enough to star in a great film under great direction. Neither of those things happen here. Blake is stunningly beautiful with great acting skills/personality, but her performance isn't enough to make ""The Shallows"" a great movie. A similar thing happened in her previous role in ""The Age of Adaline"".So, if you are a surfer who can viscerally, emotionally connect to the events in ""The Shallows"", you will likely enjoy the whole experience more than I. If you are looking for some surprises and less predictable storytelling, however, this one will probably be ""just okay"" for you."
" a grab-the-gut thriller
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,"I must be the only person on the planet who didn't see Jaws, so this genre is new to me... and The Shallows terrified me.. Everything up until the climax was credible, and totally involving. But did she really push that buoy into the shark's mouth and it didn't swerve to avoid it? and why did her rescuer leave her lying face up on the beach when she needed to expel the water in her lungs? Nonetheless, my heart and my stomach had a roller-coaster ride along with Blake Lively's 'Nancy'."
" Solid piece of work, and pretty atmospheric
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"Those of us who love the sea and admire it also fear it. The two emotions are entirely inseparable, because only human beings with too much temerity really claim to feel completely at home in the water, and none of us really and fully does.Here Blake Lively's character Nancy is certainly at the competent end of the scale, as clearly an experienced and resourceful, meticulous and careful surfer come down to Mexico to recall and somehow relive time spent on a secluded and exquisite beach with her late mother. Her awareness and good sense is further boosted by her status as a medical student (albeit apparently a lapsed/disillusioned one).Nancy therefore knows better than most what somehow we all know - even from a few minutes spent paddling, that water is wet and often cold (even in Mexico, at least at night), while most inanimate things that we make contact with as we flail about in our moments of aquatic clumsiness tend to be sharp, pointy, abrasive, hard, sticking out where we would prefer them not to, and so on. And that's just the rocks, bits of glass, flotsam and jetsom and metal items. Let's not even start with the array of prickly, spiny, bitey, stingy, well-toothed and just downright venomous forms of life that are likely to be present! So we've been warned. This is not our place, and - as the great ""Open Water"" and the separate ""Open Water 2"" made clear, it's easy to get stuck in it, ""out of our depth"" in every sense, too clumsy and inept even to do anything to right an overturned boat.Naturally, there's more than a hint of both of these films in ""The Shallows"", which certainly does not surpass those predecessors, but does start as it means to go on with a clever name, given that there is far less fear in this title than in its opposite - Peter Benchley's ""The Deep"" (successor to the immortal ""Jaws""). Everybody fears the abyss, but what could possibly go wrong in a few feet of clear, calmish, sunlit water just yards off a comforting-looking sunkissed shore? In fact, plenty can and does go wrong, but to further set up the contrast, the makers of ""The Shallows"" toy with the audience in the first part of the film, teasing us ever-so-slightly erotically (though not exploitatively) with the first moments of entry into the warm, sunlit, blue waters and sparkling white surf by our beautiful and seductively bikini- and wetsuit-clad star. For seconds, we might actually be persuaded that Nancy is some kind of ""mermaid"" who can truly be at home here...Given also the techniques used to display Nancy's text messages on the big screen, as well as her first contacts with two lads whose boards are already out there among the waves, we at times look perilously close to a teens-on-the-beach kind of movie, and doubtless that is just the effect Director Jaume Collet-Serra intends. But, while there is the odd later moment of cliché, the rest of the film stands in total contrast to this start, and that's clever enough.Since Lively is on her own for virtually the whole film, certain (reasonable-enough) devices like her talking to herself and to an injured gull are deployed - on the whole to good effect. One can fully empathise with a stranded person's desire to chat (occasionally even joke) with an equally immobilised seabird! It's essentially human.The rest of the local wildlife is obviously far less friendly, hence the need for an injured Nancy to ponder endlessly how she might get back across the short distance separating her from the beach. While ""Jaws"" has its (often strained) camaraderie between the shark-trackers, here it's Nancy and her gull, and that's quite a bit of responsibility for Blake Lively to take on. But mostly she does it well. Rightly, one believes (given the storyline) her character is old and wise beyond its years, but also gutsy, innovative and determined. The fact that this is still not enough to make the water safe or friendly is a worthwhile message made well, with Nancy's discomfiture portrayed adequately enough for most of us out here in audience-land to go ""ouch"" on many occasions. Bravely and maturely, the star also allows some shots of her tired, strained, careworn, parched-yet-wet face that are the total antithesis of publicity shots. I admired this, I must say, and if Lively seeks to be an actress of stature, well in my view she's on her way.As was intended, ""The Shallows"" comes over as a pared-down-to-the-basics but mostly well (occasionally beautifully) portrayed tale of human fear and terror in ostensibly rich and welcoming surroundings. It reminds us at the same time of human resourcefulness and courage, if firmly and rightly based on the aforementioned acknowledgment that - barring those few precious seconds of riding the waves - we can never be more than inefficient interlopers in the marine environment."
" Staying in the Shallow End.
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,7,"If you ever wondered what would happen if Asylum gave someone talented the $8.60 to make a SyFy movie. And that person actually hired other people who were talented, and sticking with the stringent parameters of the Syfy channel (must have a girl in a bikini and a shark preferably a giant flying one) made a movie. Well, wonder no more. The Shallows is an Asylum movie with good CGI, effective direction, gorgeous cinematography, talented acting and a serviceable script.The lack of campiness in the movie is actually a smidge of a drawback as one takes very seriously what is essentially a shark attack movie. And since we take the movie seriously its third act flaws are only more apparent. If the movie was staying true to its tone it certainly should have opted for a darker more realistic ending. Instead, it goes off the rails with a shark that turns into Jason Voorhees and a heroine that might as well be holding a chainsaw.I liked the seagull and I have never found Blake Lively more appealing and I find her ability to wear a bikini bottom the entire movie somewhat brave. The wife was convinced it was Chris Cooper as the father but it turns out it is Brett Cullen who is a by appearances a discount Chris Cooper. He needs to ask for more money.I am pretty sure abandoned surf beaches in Mexico lack both Uber service let alone such good cell phone service. I am also positive that most sharks would ignore you with such a big easy meal floating 50 yards away. All that said the film is very well done and acted and while the story doesn't include a flying giant octopus or comic relief I think it would make a good Syfy movie. A very good one indeed."
" Horrifying... how much time I wasted getting to the end
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,2,"Probably the most amazingly boring film I've seen in years. Long, long periods with no tension, scripting, or anticipation of any new plot elements. 2 stars only for good acting from Blake- not anywhere enough to save the film though. Cannot believe they got away with comparing this to Jaws."
" Could have been a good movie...
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,4,"...but instead, it's mediocre.First the positive things: Blake Lively does a decent job on this one, just as Steven ""Sully"" Seagull, who's the secret star in this movie. The cinematography is very good, at some points really impressive.On the other hand, there is a (especially in the second half of the movie) bad script, and with bad I mean really bad. The final sequences with the poorly looking CGI-shark are just ridiculous and gives you some face-palming WTF moments.But all in all, you can watch the movie for it's beautiful scenery and imagery. And for the Seagull."
" strong starter with a disappointing finale
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,6,"The Shallows Since the dawn of 'Jaws', any shark fanatic has swum through years of terrible attempts to recreate the unique horror and suspense a young Spielberg gifted us with. The trailers of this film looked so promising, offering what seemed to be all the right elements needed to at least confidently nod towards the great 'Jaws' in a worthy manner. Does it earn this yet unearned title?. Simply put, no. But it's not all gloom and doom. This film still floats way above all the others of its genre by an nautical mile. It has the most beautiful scenery I've seen shot on film for years, and Blake Livey does a pretty convincing job of holding 90% of the screen time herself whilst playing a stranded swimmer fighting for her life against this Great White killer. The cinematography is so impressive and really keeps this film afloat, whilst lending it a much needed expensive feel. Something lacking from every other overly CGI predecessor. With some of the most beautifully shot surfing scenes seen since the 'Endless Summer' that's where the positive stuff comes to a disappointing end. The problem with this film is the content. It just doesn't generate the type of aquatic horror you want when watching. It has some individual scenes that are good but the overall tone is not enough to compete. It's almost like the writers got so far and thought 'lets just get this out ASAP' and end with some predictable scenes and some dodgy CGI, as they attempt to over expose the shark to a sad end. Instead simply giving us a few cringey shots that undo everything the film almost delivered. This film starts really strong and makes you almost believe that you're finally watching that shark film you always dreamed of. As it gives with one hand during the first half. It takes it back with the other during the last half. Still worth the watch as long as you don't expect to be treated with the new wave of fishy horror. Slick starter with stunning scenery, beautifully captured. A good performance by the leading lady. Just empty content with not enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Followed by a disappointing second half."
" Scary and Well Adapted
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,7,All gamers would certainly know how scary this Shark looks like in FarCry 4. Well rendered and adapted movie scene depicting the certainty of encountering a shark just next to the beach after a 30 min swim.All shots were in close range giving you a nice view of the scene in detail. The Shark was absolutely amazing as well as crazily scary! All scenes of this Shark beats 'Jaws' and 'Deep Blue Sea' by 5 points..lol!! It's cunning sense and agility to maneuver itself around the reef rock was amazing.Totally worth watching!!
" Presemptuous on certain aspects...
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,4,"I really had a hard time rating this movie. Intrinsically I would not call it bad because the landscape pretty wonderful, as a would expect for surfing places that are uncommon to mass tourism; the directing, shooting, camera angles [...] are all pretty cool and coherent although I did find the action a little bit long to start.With such a simple plot, I was really curious to see how exactly they were going to drive this out and make some sense out of it. I guess, it was a mix between a C-version of ""In the heart of the sea"" and an underpowered ""Jaws"". No doubts that they really went a little bit too far attributing superhuman power to the poor baby shark who really was not asking to be that good.Ain't it? That's the problem of the movie to me. Under the angle I felt under which is was shot, under a realistic perspective, they tried to extend the shark beyond its capabilities and it just could not corroborate anymore with reality. This movie was clearly navigating between three or four different genres due to the extreme simplicity of the plot and the desire to make a ""serious"" story out of the whole thing.Sharks tend to not like the taste of the human flesh/skin and attack surfers by the purest virtue of accident. They attack them because they tend to mistake them for squeals or anyways some sort of animal swimming at the surface but have no interest in having human beings for their regular meal. On that basis alone, unfortunately, the moment the shark started parking around the poor Blake Lively looking for a meal, the whole premise of the movie came to fail.The whole Lively acting was not Oscar worthy, obviously, I'm not sure how I felt about her driving the emotions of a movie like this except probably the parts where she was feeling nostalgia remembering the good things she had left behind for her singular personal quest of riding a surfboard in the middle of nowhere. Even interpretation of physical pain weren't entirely convincing and felt more like somebody having sexual fun than one that would be really struggling from a shark attack.Additionally, Some scenes are obviously a little bit pushed, for instance, her inability to quickly process the fact that she is in risky area and escape herself instead of waiting like an elderly for someone to grab her out from there, or, the fact that a bunch of dudes leave without even watching one last time to the horizon...Finally, I have to admit, the unexpected relationship between Lively and a bird was actually kind of cute to say the least."
" Anyone giving a good review of this is on crack
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,3,"No more needs to be said really. All the bad reviews are spot on. I've never been so disappointed in my life for deciding to waste 90 minutes of my own life. The three stars are for the scenery and the seagull. Not even close to unrealistic. In fact, it's so far past it, it's like it's stuck on a buoy out to sea. Makes Jaws look like an incredibly great and realistic movie. There was one thing I guess I cared a little about in this movie, whether or not she survived. Problem was the movie was so bad that I really didn't want to know how she did/didn't survive, I just wanted to know the result. I beg of you to watch something else, anything."
" A Sports Illustrated surfing screen saver with a JAWS
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,1,"I went in to this movie with lowwww, lowwwwwwww expectations, badgered into it by gf and pvr'd it thank god. I was shocked at how high my expectations were...For the first half hour of his movie we are treated to slow mo scenes of hot blonde surfer girl walking to water, riding board, flicking hair around, watching cut scenes of monster waves from monster wave surf beaches that cannot possibly exist where she is approaching her, watch her surf these monster waves that appear out of nowhere in this tranquil Mexican bay, slow mo, hair flik, cute guys watch approvingly, etc.Then a whale carcass pops in from out of nowhere. it appears a gigantic megalodon sized shark has bitten the top of this whale's head off...girl get's thrown off board (while riding impossibly gigantic wave, by impossibly gigantic great white) and ends up surfing the whale. The shark is apparently NOT FULL. Girl must make it to a rock, where she spends most of the movie, with a comic relief seagull that should have been animated and have a jaunty name.This great white is ridiculously large (JAWS II and worse size) and ridiculously HUNGRY. She's (no male could ever reach this size) already eaten HALF A WHALE... but no, she must now chow down on a succession of DUMB MEN who try to rescue our blonde in distress. At one point this hate filled sea monster tries to climb up on the rock. It also dismantles a bouy when she swims to that.She manages to nurse having her leg almost bitten off, somehow she just keeps making more blood to gush out of her....The final kill scene against the shark is truly cringe inspiring, with the clearly big rubber shark doll diving head first into the bottom of the ocean like a crashing jet fighter. And my respect for this garbage movie."
" Super overrated vacuous plot .
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,4,"If you haven't seen any good Shark movie yet , then i reckon you may going to enjoy this film , but if you've watched plenty movies like this genre before, then you will not see any new impressive ideas ,and absolutely , it's a waste of time ,there were scenes that make no sense at all like the foolishness of 'nancy' character ,'blake lovely' i'd like to ask the scenarist , Is it really meant to be like this? .I believe the movie's earnings were much more than it deserved , maybe because the people expected a neoteric shark film ideas ,and frankly 'Anthony Jaswinski' hasn't done any previous work that deserves any critic's compliment , therefore i guess all these high rates was because of 'Blake Lively' fans , and to tell the truth she did astonishing job in this film when she played the dramatic role as Nancy . The four stars i gave to this film were for the music guy who made the exciting atmosphere more than the story itself ,and for the two listens i benefited from it, the first one is knowledge utility appears when you fall in trouble , the second is what you say might come true and it doesn't have to be Christmas ,lol 'Karma' . finally if you're a Mexican you might find it somewhat offensive because of some of Mexican characters who meant to be imbecile. Thank you ."
" Great movie but not a horror movie!
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,9,"I thought it was a great movie but as for a horror movie, it wasn't. It was an inspirational movie because she over came the problem, recovered from her injuring, finished med school and reconnected and got closer to her family. I would say it would have been a horror movie if there at the end she almost killed the shark but instead got eaten. I told people about this and they asked if anyone died and yes there were some that died but they were idiots. The drunkard deserved because of the theft and the other two were just unaware of their surroundings. I am a big believer of everyone being armed so she should have had a Glock 20 (10mm) with her and could have eliminated the problem right away and saved her self a lot of pain."
" 'The Shallows' is shallow.
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,3,"Note to filmmakers: When you make a movie, DON'T use slow motion for over 80% of your film, especially in the horror/thriller genre. It takes the audience out of the moment, as is the horrid case with the new killer shark movie 'The Shallows'. After sleeping on it for a night, this film might be one of the worst and silliest films to come out this year. It's terrible filmmaking on just about every level. It's poorly written, poorly shot, and doesn't make a lick of sense. Blake Lively, who plays a young woman named Nancy, does a decent enough job with the material she's given, but after reading the screenplay, I would have walked far away from this film and never looked back, even if I got to go to Australia for a few weeks and film.There's just so much wrong with this movie, it's hard to decipher where to begin, but as a charming nun/babysitter said, ""Let's start at the very beginning."" We first meet Nancy (Lively) as she is being driven to a remote beach to surf while she is on vacation. It is implied that she dropped out of med school after her mother died of cancer (a horrible side story full of cheese). She's being driven through a beautiful part of the forest to get to this amazing paradise view, but you wouldn't know it, because the director has Nancy texting her friend the whole time, while the screen captions are displayed largely on the screen at all times in real time.The stupid thing about this is that the camera even shows the actual phone screen in frame as well through all of this. We just miss out on all the supposed beautiful shots and cinematography. After a few minutes of this, Nancy is in the water by herself, surfing the big waves, which is when everything become slow motion for the duration of the film. Her hair flings back with water, the waves crash down, and some average surfing maneuvers are all shown in slow motion. I'm convinced that the writer and director here only had enough material for about twenty minutes of film, but made it in slow-motion to drag it out to just over 80-minutes. I'm not kidding.Soon enough, a big killer shark chomps Nancy on the leg, the blood starts flowing, and she swims over to a nearby small rock for safety, which is about 200 yards from the beach. This is where Nancy stays basically for the duration of the film by herself. Well not really by herself, there is a seagull she names Stephen on the rock with her, who was also injured in the shark attack. No, I'm not making this up. A few people walk by on the beach, but are attacked and killed by the shark, leaving poor Nancy stranded on the rock. Nothing seems to go her way either as she talks to herself or really us, the audience in everything that she does. It's quite annoying and everything just gets sillier and dumber all the way up to the final credits of the movie.Do I have anything good to say about this movie? Minor things, I guess, including some good use of practical blood effects and a few minor suspenseful scenes with the shark, but that's about it. From Nancy's phone getting internet access on the remote beach in the middle of nowhere, to the seagull that always seems to have the answer, to the 'JAWS' wink where Nancy tells the shark to go screw itself as she shoots a gun - it all just falls insanely flat and makes you roll your eyes and wish you hadn't spend 80 minutes watching this movie."
" The Shallows runs aground
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,5,"Considering how entertaining Serra's last three movies were, The Shallows came off as disappointing. I had a hunch that it would be a little cheesy, but what unfolds on the screen could almost be mistaken for a comedy.A nicely shot (although noticeable colour-toned) film, The Shallows renders Blake Lively helpless on a reef, just a hundred feet from shore, after a bite to the leg from a territorial great white. It is a remote and obscure beach, where the only soul who wanders in after the first act is a potbellied drunk who is too full of tequila to hear our heroine scream for help. While stuck on the reef, she also has the company of an injured seagull, who I kept wishing was Wilson the Volleyball. Blake Lively is not a bad actress but she is not a good one either. She goes through all the motions of a damsel in distress who ends up having to save herself, but the role could have been played by a porn star. There are too many moments prompting unintentional laughter for The Shallows to work as a thriller. It gives us a great white shark that is credibly animated, yet unscary. Perhaps part of the problem is that the animal is just too real. In Jaws, we saw the great white not as a shark but as a monster. Jaws also worked because it made us not merely afraid of the shark, but of the water. In a movie like the Shallows however, the ocean is a beautiful place,and beneath the waves, you have a hundred foot visibility.Blake beats the shark through a brainy, dare devilish manoeuvre but by the time we get there, we are too far detached to care. This is not an unwatchable movie, but it is best enjoyed merely as Blake Lively beach porn. If you want to see a better movie of this type, try The Reef."
" Shallow, indeed...
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,5,"Due to technical difficulties, the shark in JAWS wasn't really seen until relatively late in the going; it was only glimpsed briefly here and there before the Big Reveal. Chalk one up for the problems with Practical Effects: the suspenseful ""build-up"" worked to the movie's advantage. In THE SHALLOWS, we never once get the feeling that the shark is anything more than cgi gone wild: it's never really threatening, even when it's within arm's reach. (I saw a shark from 40 feet away, and it STILL scared the s--- out of me; the sheer size was overwhelming, not to mention the idea that it's sole objective in life was to FEED...) Another problem I noticed: the Tide doesn't come in the first night our heroine is stranded on the rock. And what DID happen to the body on the beach...? The absurd dues ex machine miracle ending was the worst breach of trust of all. Still, I give it a 5 for the star's performance."
" I was with you until the shark turned into a stalker
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,3,"This movie started out well. A very attractive woman surfing on a beautiful, secluded beach. There was some great cinematography and shots of the area. Blake Lively even seems to be a decent actress.Then the shark stuff starts, and from the very beginning, we have to forget about everything we know about sharks and play pretend. First of all, she really ticks off the shark somehow by disturbing its ""feeding grounds."" She approaches a dead whale that the shark was feeding on and seems to have offended the shark somehow. So the shark ignores the thousands of pounds of floating, dead meat in the water for the rest of the movie, and pursues the 100 pound surfer girl exclusively.The surfer seeks refuge on the carcass of the whale, then the shark drags a dead whale many times its size further out into the ocean, and seems hell bent on knocking her off. In her escape from the floating whale to a small rock outcropping, she's bitten by the shark, and has some serious wounds from both the bite and coral. The shark is circling her, she's bleeding heavily, and there's no one around who can help.At this point, I'm still willing to forgive the whole shark ignoring the dead whale to pursue a person who isn't even in the water any more. It still felt suspenseful. I wanted her to find a way out and survive. The movie still had my interest and I still cared what happened to her.Then things got real, real stupid. The shark continued to circle, and killed a drunk on the beach who was trying to reach her. Then it killed two other surfers that she'd met the day before. It tried jumping up on the coral to reach her, and pretty much completely stopped acting like a shark. She managed to escape to a buoy as the tide came in, and the shark proceeded to rip the giant, steel buoy to pieces. She shoots the shark with a flare gun then lights whale oil in the water on fire with it, also lighting the shark on fire. I had already written off the movie at this point, but kept watching as I was already close to the end.She then ties herself to the anchor that was holding the buoy in place, and as the shark breaks the chains away she is pulled hundreds of feet under water in the matter of a couple of seconds, and the shark chases her at full speed with reckless abandon to kill her. It ends up impaling itself on the jagged spikes which were apparently part of the anchor.And yea, that was it. A stranded, wounded surfer with nothing kills an over 20 foot long shark by making it chase her into spikes. Dumb.You know what would have been good? A wounded surfer on a small rock outcropping tries to keep her sanity and get help to survive a shark attack. Leave out the dead whale because that kind of made the rest of the movie not make sense. Don't make a wounded, half dead surfer kill a 20+ foot shark, that's not the victory that the movie needed. It would have been sufficient to have her survive. You don't have to schlock it up with the typical Hollywood type ending.Sharks are scary enough, you don't have to make it cartoonish shark with a vendetta against a surfer. Every time the shark did something stupid that a shark would never do, it became less suspenseful. I don't know why they went down that road, but they turned a movie that started out pretty suspenseful into a SciFi Channel made for TV special with a dumb ending."
" Very boring and disappointing
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,2,"disappointing and Boring... One girl for 97% of the movie , which it basically all takes place on a rock. Unrealistic , boring, silly ... I would hardly call it a thrill. The trailer didn't show much, because there wasn't much to show. I wanted to like it but I was so bored I was angry for even paying to see it. My kids wanted to see it even more and even they were falling asleep . It had a moment or two but over all it was a big waste of time. I hope one day they can come out with another good shark movie . We actually almost left during the the drive in but I admit we wanted to see the end ... we kept thinking maybe .. just maybe it would get better ..it just didn't happen. If it's free on TV I may watch it for a few if nothing is on. Even that is doubtful"

" Enjoyable disaster movie! 5/10
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"Review: Although this movie isn't in the same league as Jaws, it's still full of intensity and it does make you think, ""What would I do in the situation"". It's based around Nancy (Blake Lively), who goes to Mexico, after losing her mum, to surf in a secluded beach after her friend ditches her at the last minute. After bumping into 2 other surfers, who are filming there experience, she prepares to take her last waves for the day, while the other surfers leave the beach. She then sees a dead whale, which has obviously been there for some time, and while she investigates the carcass, she is bitten on the leg by a white shark, so she climbs on the whale for safety. With the shark circling her location, and her leg causing her a lot of pain, Nancy stays on the whale for a while and then she is forced to swim to a rock, because the whale starts to float away. Whilst on the Rock, her only company is a small seagull, who has damaged it's wing so it can't fly away. After spending the night on the rock, and using her imagination to attend to her wounds, the surfers return to do some more filming, and when they see Nancy on the Rock, they attempt to save her life, which ends up to be a complete disaster. With high tide coming up, Nancy has to think of a way to survive, so she records a message to her family, using the surfers video camera and throwing it towards the shore. She then works out a way to swim to a nearby buoy, which is much higher than the rock she is currently on. Once on the buoy, she finds a flare gun, which doesn't really help her situation, and she soon comes face to face with the white shark, which has made her Mexican experience a complete nightmare. Although this movie is mostly based on one character, there is enough material to keep the movie interesting throughout, and Blake Lively put in a convincing performance, even though the cameraman seemed to like close-ups of her body a bit too much. The shark looked pretty scary, especially when it was attacking the buoy but it's not the type of film that you can watch time and time again. Once you know the outcome of the film, it takes away the intensity of the plot but it's still a decent watch the first time round. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Blake Lively isn't actually a household name yet but she did play the lead in the Age of Adaline and the love interest in Savages. She also starred in Hick, Green Lantern, the Town, the Private Live of Pippa Lee and New York, I Love You, and after the popularity of this movie, the only way is up for the 29 year old star. This film was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, 42, who also brought you House of Wax, Goal II, Orphan, Unknown, Non- Stop and Run All Night. After working with Liam Neeson in his last 3 projects, he is due to release another movie starring Neeson, called the Commuter, which will also stars Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga and Sam Neill, so he's obviously built a trusting relationship with the star, who has said goodbye to the Taken franchise. As for this movie, I have to commend the director for his camera work in the sea, because it's definitely not the easiest task for any director, and I was quite impressed with the cinematography. I personally think that this is a well put together movie which was a surprising hit at the box office, and it proves that we are still entertained by disaster movies, involving unpredictable forces of nature.Budget: $17million Worldwide Gross: $119millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/thriller/dramas, starring Blake Lively, Oscar Jaenada, Brett Cullen, Angelo Josue Lozano Corzo and Sedona Legge. 5/10"
" It is the best movie in 2016 and so underrated
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,8,"I have to say this movie is so underrated, it is way better than many movies which rated above 7 marks here. Why? It is because it has a really completed script, it is simple and meaningful. The relationships between the main character and her families, her friends, her life and the nature, are so beautifully combined together. Yes it is a survival movie, however it has more meaning behind those struggles and the ways to solve them. Although parts of the film you might find that were similar to JAWS, according to the story telling method, but you will see there are new elements and creative details as well. 2016 was not a good year of movie (just on my personal opinion), this movie is the one that you should never miss!"
" Great movie!
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,10,"Loved this movie! It was such a cool moment to spot our earrings on Blake's character. We now know that jewelry can double as a survival kit! It's not your typical shark film and it is filled with a lot of anxiety-inducing scenes. Really intense movie with a stellar performance by Blake Lively. Every character served their purpose in piecing together the story, including the bird! It's a good movie to watch with the family or with your significant other. Blake is one of my favorite actresses so this movie comes highly recommended! She is able to carry the movie even though there are some scenes with a few different characters. Love, JLANI Jewels"
" Conventional and yet watchable B movie
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,6,"I thought this movie was pretty good for a B movie. On the surface it's like a generic shark attack movie that takes on a serious approach. And when it comes down to it, it's a simple survival movie where the protagonist has to use all her wits, resources and ingenuity in order to survive. But the parts about the lead's will to survive and her transition as a character is what makes this one stand out for a B movie. At the start she is a very pessimistic character that doesn't believe in the point of trying if the odds are against her. Mainly because of her mother's death. But as the protagonist is face with death at the shallows it brings about her survival instincts. Overall this is conventional movie that is watchable.6.4/10"
" Blake Lively does a good job
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I think that the authors of the most negative reviews may have missed the movie's point. The movie's director states this is a movie that is about a survivor. Director Jaume Collet-Serra notes ""This isn't a creature movie"". Don't look for the ""monster"" buildup you saw in ""Jaws"" (a shark) or ""The Edge"" (a grizzly bear). This movie's focus is the main character's (Blake Lively) struggle to survive the worst possible odds and circumstances. Miss Lively acts the part wonderfully even though there is minimal dialogue in this movie. Her interaction with the seagull is the best I've seen in recent movies.The sets (a real beach mixed with a tank with blue-screens) are very effective and the tank (instead of a compromised effort always using an actual beach location) makes the movie more watchable. The lighting in the tank is superb and reminds me of the great aquarium effects in the movie ""Life of Pi."" If you are willing to suspend some disbelief and accept the movie for what it is (a survival tale with some embellishments to make the story interesting), you will enjoy this movie. The acting is excellent with a good screenplay; and the cinematography, lighting, and sound effects are well above average."
" Awful plot line, decent CGI sequences
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,3,"The stupidly unrealistic things in this movie significantly distracted from my being able to enjoy it.The overarching problem for me was the bizarre dichotomy of the main (and pretty much only) character who is supposed to be very intelligent but keeps making bad decisions that any normal person would not. We're told she made it quite a ways through med school before taking break for a while. Med school is incredibly difficult and if someone gets in and makes it most of the way through and takes a break voluntarily, they are most certainly are not stupid.First stupid thing...the movie opens with her driving in a remote area of Mexico on a desolate road in an old truck alone with middle aged Mexican man she just met. How many intelligent mid 20's attractive American women are going to hop in a truck, by themselves, to reach a remote hidden beach that a strange man in a beat up truck who claims to know where it is? Any women with a half a brain isn't going to do that, let alone one smart enough to be in med school.It just goes on from there with bad decision after bad decision. How about this one, you see a huge dead floating whale, what do you do? We'll our character, a very experienced surfer, decides to swim up to it. No one with a reasonable amount of experience in the ocean is going to swim up to a dead whale carcass. Bad, bad, idea.It just goes on from there.The CGI action sequences were reasonably well done, yes you could tell it was CGI, but it was okay at least. Some of things the CGI whale did however were ridiculous.I only paid $0.99 to watch and still wondered if I paid too much."
