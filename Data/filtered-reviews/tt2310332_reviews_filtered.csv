" Should not of been a trilogy!
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,5,Why would you risk tarnishing your incredible record as a oscar winning director? For a new swimming pool! One hobbit film wouldve been perfect. A nice sweet gift to all the mega fans that delivers a 4 star film and noone could complain. But turning a small book into 3 hour movies is just a big no and that came to fruition in this one as the rating shows. My advice? Watch the first hobbit and leave the rest.
" Three is always the unlucky number in trilogies
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,5,"The hobbit battle of the five armies is unfortunate not as much of an epic conclusion to the hobbit trilogy as one might hope. this movie does not live up to what is promising and the overall conflict and struggle that is going on majority of the movie is taken between the dwarves and the people of lake town and the elf's. movie does not go any where and I mean that in a literal sense majority of the movie is ""focused on the dwarves remaining in the mountain for the whole movie until the final battle whether it's the theatrical or extended edition this movie was much longer than it needed to be as if it was just stretched out just to see the three hour maximum runtime that return of the king had apart from the army of orcs the motive for majority of the fighting is not justified or investing. In the end the last film you see Smaug getting ready to destroy lake town and as so this film begins it literally after like 10minutes smaug is killed and that's the end of it but we spend the rest of the movie seeing Thorin succumb to the madness. Gandalf and the other wizards essentially find out that the whole audience knew right away who is the one who is the cause of all this who the orcs work for and what is driving them. The Final battle biilbo doesn't even really do anything directly it makes you question why he accepted Thorin giving him the mithril vest."
" Loved the first film, enjoyed the second but this third installment - while passable - leaves me with a feeling of wanting something else from it
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,7,"Exactly what it says on the tin - to a fault.Don't get me wrong, I like it. However, towards the end 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' definitely begins to drag quite heavily - the impact of what eventually happens did not, to be honest, hit as strongly as it could've/should've. The pure action is good, but there's not much to remember about everything else.None of the characters, with the exception of Richard Armitage (Thorin) and Luke Evans (Bard) I guess, stand out amidst the wall-to-wall battle. Martin Freeman (Bilb), Ian McKellen (Gandalf) & Co. are are of little importance really, which is a shame.'The Hobbit' series, unfortunately, gets inferior as it goes by. Loved the first film, enjoyed the second but this third installment - while passable - leaves me with a feeling of wanting something else from it. Happy to have watched them though, I'd still recommend them for sure."
" When everything falls apart
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,2,"Peter Jackson knew these movies wouldn't be good, he had to have.I'm not dissin' you Peter! hey, I really love you man, but the money you and that company made off those movies can't buy back disappointment."
" Extended Edition (3D)
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,9,"The extended version is definitely better than the theatrical cut and contains more action.
The battle itself is longer and bloodier, and the fight scenes are
somewhat more brutal than they are in the theatrical version.
The cinematography is great, as are the 3D effects.
The film was shot mostly in 3D and that's how it should be viewed.
When you look at it in 3D, it's a totally different experience, and
the film itself seems better because you get another dimension
that you haven't seen before.
The film is not without its flaws, but it is still fun and
interesting, and the 3D is amazing.
A great visual experience that should definitely be viewed in 3D."
" Love this
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,10,I love all Lord of the rings movies and the hobbit. But this movie is so great and i love the ending of the hobbit :)
" It's the humane and generous nature that keeps relationships last longer
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,8,"What worked:
What made the movie still an interesting and enjoyable watch is the presence of the essence that makes it a Peter Jackson movie. The music steals the show, along with the good cinematography and editing. The movie is also saved by some of the good performances by the founding actors of the movie, making us relate even more to the story being told.
What did not work:
I think the biggest weakness of the movie has got to do with the screenplay and the writing, which in itself is not bad but it's obvious for the viewers to compare with the legendary trilogy. In that regard, the movie failed critically as we as financially. LOTR had a better mission, universal appeal, beautifully woven narrative that combined the three books together. The finale of Hobbit was still grandiose in terms of budget, production as well as execution. What we did not have was the strong narrative that glued the three chapters altogether in the fashion that was expected from the team
Final verdict: recommended"
" Least iconic of the three movies but still amazing
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,"This movie is the least iconic one in the trilogy but it makes up for it with a really cool battle.Also, personally I love Azog. He's pretty epic."
" Good luck Amazon beating these masterpieces
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,10,Peter Jackson is unstoppable when it comes to fantasy epics. All three are a masterpiece like LOTR. Find the extended versions and R cut of Battle of the Five Armies. It's 10 times better with over 17 minutes of additional battle scenes. Perfection Peter Jackson
" The irregularity in the narrative rhythm is clear in the three films of The Hobbit, with the script extending into unnecessary scenes
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Peter Jackson included in the scripts some unfinished stories written by Tolkien himself and situations to interconnect the two trilogies, reusing characters like Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom), the available material did not need three films to be presented to the public. It is a nonsense even in relation to The Lord of the Rings, whose three books were wiped so that they each yielded a feature film of around three hours in length. Faced with this decision of economic background (as well as the use of 3D), the new trilogy was previously prejudiced. The irregularity in the narrative rhythm is clear in the three films, with the script extending into unnecessary scenes or giving too much prominence to characters that are not so important.Deciding to change the plot written by Tolkien over 70 years ago is not the problem. Different media deserve different and necessary treatments. Jackson's first trilogy is proof of that. The problem with the last part of this new crack is that there was not enough skill to tell a story well that it was primarily about discovering a new world and being enchanted with any and all novelties. The Hobbit is not about massive war. The Hobbit is not The Lord of the Rings. The primary relationship of the whole plot is in Bilbo and Thorin. If the first one ends up succumbing to the Mountain disease - something that has long been announced and little taken seriously until then - the second will be the voice of reason for the peoples in conflict, showing themselves once and for all how even the smallest of those involved can be the one with the most strength and responsibilities. Armitage and Freeman reiterate with a singular effect the partnership seen in The Lord of the Rings in Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) and Elijah Wood (Frodo), dividing the protagonism of the story without ever letting the attention be diverted, both responding for the most electrifying moments of this saga. The duo's performance is impeccable, the dialogues flow and even Peter Jackson's narrative exaggerations (slow cameras and close-ups) serve as impact tools. By neglecting the importance of the two and including uninteresting cores in the plot, The Battle of the Five Armies becomes the most boring chapter of the journey through Middle-earth. Legolas, who is almost a protagonist, distills embarrassing speeches alongside Tauriel; a pair as uninteresting as Alfrid, the comedian played by Ryan Gage, who is not just a coward, but the caricature of one (and the fact that Bard gives him several tasks leads us to question the subject's intelligence), whereas Thorin's transformation, in addition to being abrupt, is accompanied by digital changes in the tone of his voice as his face begins to be plunged into shadows.From a structural point of view, this final chapter of the trilogy is nothing more than an immense third act, consisting of a climax whose endless duration, but chills to anyone who knows the least about dramaturgy, since, as an independent narrative, The Battle of the Five Armies is an obvious failure. In this respect, it is enough to compare The Hobbit to The Lord of the Rings to see how the structure was cohesive there, since each film, even telling only part of the main story, brought its own three well-defined and antagonistic acts and conflicts that conferred a sense of outcome for each chapter. In contrast, in this new trilogy Jackson and his companions invested in long, disposable passages that clearly aimed to justify the existence of three films - and thus we were forced to accompany dinners showered with endless music, the procedure of resurrecting a hedgehog, an extensive plan to steal weapons that were useless and, of course, the fight between a dwarf and a pig for some medicinal herbs.The initial fears surfaced and materialized in the first twenty minutes of the projection. Peter Jackson simply destroys what many consider to be the climax of the book, fitting that moment into the first twenty minutes of his third film. The feeling that we are watching the closing of the previous film is evident - The Desolation of Smaug was stolen from its most dramatic moment simply so that Peter could create a gigantic cliffhanger, certainly fearing that audiences would not see the third film after such a fateful event. The fact of leaving Smaug's attack for this last episode not only deprived the previous film of an appropriate outcome but also sabotaged the urgency of the Esgaroth massacre, since, when opening the projection, it surprises the viewer who is still ""cold"": there is tension in the presented situation, but not in the narrative. Yes, the sequence is intense and grandiose, but it would have been more impactful and urgent if it had benefited from the continuity of the story instead of being hampered by an arbitrary interruption for financial purposes.
The Battle of the Five Armies simply does not allow anyone, regardless of which side of the screen one is on, to breathe easily. The action is almost uninterrupted and very well linked, with each event making full sense and leading to another one even more apotheotic. If you witness Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), the elven queen, going into the fight with full powers for the first time is already intoxicating, understanding why Saruman (Christopher Lee) is the White - that is, the most powerful of his order - is a pleasure simple. The romantic drama involving Legolas (Orlando Bloom, elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner) is expendable, but here comes at the right times - and its conclusion is thrilling in the right measure, without stealing the light from others. situations or even to the point of being disposable.The end result of The Battle of the Five Armies is a film that we cannot identify with. There is little progression of characters - and when it appears it is artificial. With so many patches, the Battle of the Five Armies remains a great clip of uninterrupted action. From the confrontation with Smaug to the war in Erebor, Jackson displays his entire repertoire of choreographies of individual fights and group combat. Success is punctual. It works in the union of elves and dwarves, but fails in the eternal dispute between Legolas and Bolg. This last chapter also lacks an unforgettable sequence comparable to the scenes in Minas de Moria (The Fellowship of the Ring), Helm's Abyss (The Two Towers), the goblins' cave (An Unexpected Journey) or the brook of the Dark Forest ( The Desolation of Smaug).It is not that the work of the writing quartet no longer has other serious problems, such as the excess of expository dialogues: ""We need water! "","" We will not survive three days! ""Shout the citizens of Esgaroth off the field as Bard passes by the screen, in a moment only rivaled by another in which a certain character says"" The battle for the Mountain is about to begin! "". And the one who brings Tauriel (Lilly) exclaiming ""Gundabad!"" upon arriving at the destination to which he had headed with Legolas (Bloom). And if Peter Jackson keeps in the habit of including countless aerial planes and keeping his camera always moving, taking out any impact that these features could bring, the Howard Shore trail follows his example by practically avoiding any second of silence, striving to comment on each action pass. The composer is certainly not up to his composition in the trilogy The Lord of the Rings and does not even bring a striking melody. We are left with a distressing feeling of emptiness when we see truly epic sequences being deconstructed by the absence of music. This feature, which already comes from the previous film, extends to the rest of the feature film and the track only regains our attention in the final credits through ""The Last Goodbye"", created and recorded by none other than Billy Boyd, also known as Pippin.Which brings us to what is perhaps the biggest problem in The Hobbit: the fact that, in addition to transforming the title character into a supporting role throughout the three films, we end up betting on a gallery of creatures that never clearly define themselves even with almost nine hours of projection. It is unbelievable that the dwarves remain as a mass of non-individualized figures and that - as if that were not enough - the main one is such an unsympathetic subject most of the time. In fact, dislike shared with Thranduil - and, if we consider that the humans seen here are a people without any charisma, it remains to be seen that the battle that serves as the climax of the trilogy is disputed by a bunch of characters whose fates do not really matter, since we only hope that Bilbo escapes alive (which we already know will happen).Impressive as usual in its production design (the frozen waterfall that serves as the backdrop for one of the final clashes is overwhelming) and the visual effects (although Legolas and Elrond's digital makeup is terrifying), The Battle of the Five Armies does work thanks to the intensity of the title clash, which offers Jackson the opportunity to create fabulous images like the one that brings dwarves to form a barrier with their shields while elven soldiers jump over this towards the orcs.In the end, the Hobbit trilogy is marked much more by the technical side of production and the reunion with Tolkien's magical world in cinema. All of the films are fun and technically impressive, but also irregular. Still, the new trilogy leaves for posterity two great characters, Thorin and Smaug, who deserve to be remembered alongside Gandalf, Frodo, Legolas, Gimli, Sam, Aragorn, Saruman and many others from The Lord of the Rings. Unlike the first trilogy, The Hobbit does not stand on its own. Much of the strength of his characters and the benefit of the story as a whole comes precisely from what was shown before, skillfully conducted by Peter Jackson in order to explore, also, the feeling of nostalgia with the viewer."
" An underrated finale to the Hobbit Trilogy
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,8,"As someone who grew up as a big fan of the book, as well as the LOTR films, I was sceptical when it was announced the 300ish page book would be stretched into three (very long) films. However, I feel like I'm in the minority here as I really enjoy this trilogy and by extension, this film.While I agree that the third film is overly dependant on mediocre CGI and some of the characters (*cough* Tauriel) aren't especially well written, I still really like this film.In contrast to An Unexpected Journey, it seems to drag less and have a more mature and darker atmosphere, with the exception of the scenes with Alfrid and The Master.Another unpopular opinion: I really think the character development in this film is quite good. Thorin's slow descent into madness and his subsequent redemption is well handled and Bilbo's moral dilemma of whether or not to let Thorin have the Arkenstone is certainly interesting.Also, I cannot stress enough how much I love some of the action in this film. From the stunning opening scenes of Smaug's destruction to the huge central battle. Also, why the hell did they delete the Gandalf rescue scene from the original cut, it is dare I say, one of my all time favourite scenes from the franchise and fills in several plot holes in the original release.Overall, while nowhere near to the heights of the original LOTR trilogy, in my opinion, this is still a very solid film. While it's generally thought to be the weakest film in the series (although I probably prefer it to An Unexpected Journey), this is by no means a bad film, which is really a testament to the franchise as a whole.(That was a lot of writing... I'm sorry)"
" Disappointing trilogy.
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,3,"The Battle of the Five Armies is more of the same with no charm, but worse.Silliness reigns in this one, with empty Evangeline Lilly romance, CGI Billy Connolly head ramming and Legolas who's just too ridiculous. He makes Rambo, the Terminator and even Chuck Norris look pretty pedestrian here. Lee Pace is woeful and Martin Freeman doesn't resemble Ian Holm in the slightest, so it doesn't flow. Smaug was what the film had going for it, but killed early and without merit."
" The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,6,"The death of Smaug in the first ten minutes destroyed the film for me, and I did not care much about the events because in the previous part they showed Smaug as an invincible being, but he died in one blow, and in the first ten minutes of the film the fighting scenes in the film were great. The romance in the film was not good. Sauron with Gandalf was hugely awesome"
" Amazing movie
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,A great movie as usual from Peter Jackson you just need to see the extended version 🙂
" Abomination of Tolkien's Work
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,3,"Where do Peter Jackson go wrong? He took all the great things in the LOTR trilogy and then canned them. Far too much emphasis on plot devices and set pieces and little on narrative. The Hobbit is one of the great literature pieces of the 20th Century and to see it disassembled and regurgitated in this manner is shameless. The retelling of the story is disrespectful to the original with a bit of added on arrogance - Jackson obviously sees himself as a better storyteller than Tolkien regardless of the medium. Overlong, poorly scripted and some terrible casting, this really is a bad movie and don't let the LOTR/Jackson fanboys tell you otherwise."
" The weakest link in the chain, but still worth-watching
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,7,"This is the part of the trilogy least faithful to the book, focusing way too much in the battles and the violence, rather than its themes.It is still fun to watch, but some parts from it feel a bit rushed (Notice how the CGI effects seem rather unpolished in comparison with the other two movies)The final scene was still a neat farewell to Middle Earth. I honestly don't expect anything good from the Amazon upcoming Lord of the Ring series."
" Ends the trilogy reasonably satisfactorily despite ""more quantity than quality""
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,7,"Positive:
impressive visuals and spectacular action scenesEmotional reference to charactersNegative:
narratively and dramaturgically underdeveloped, what is tried to compensate by a big battle"
" Fun to watch if you just have a laugh at it
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,6,"LOTR are my favourite movies ever. Nothing will likely ever top them.The Hobbit trilogy was fun, makes me laugh every time, often at the films more than with them. I do love the sheer awkwardness of basically every scene, I wonder if it was intentional or by accident, or both?The acting is amazing, but you can definitely see how stressed the production process was. I feel bad for Peter Jackson and the tough situation he was forced into by the studios. Either he makes three films himself in New Zealand, or the studios move the production to Europe without him. Kind of checkmate really. Couldn't have been a nice work environment atall, and it really shows in the scrappy final production, with extreme reliance on CGI and exposition that keeps going forever.Often the makeup continuity is all over the place. In some scenes, Kili and Thorin look like Klingons out of Star Trek, and the next minute they look completely different, not like dwarves but like attractive pop/rock stars.Unlike the LOTR films which are seamless right through, never once breaking immersion, the Hobbit trilogy has a hard time even creating immersion in the first place, as it's really difficult to watch these movies and not see the production process and flaws everywhere. There are scenes that are amazingly good at creating immersion however.For me, LOTR feels like a commitment to sit down and watch, in a good way. The Hobbit trilogy is more of a fun romp that you can relax and laugh with.The worst thing about the Hobbit trilogy is how none of the plotlines have any payoff by the end. It's really quite disappointing and sad. We journey with the dwarves and all the amazing cast of characters for 3 long movies, and by the end it all kind of just fizzles out and then it's over. What happened with Bard? Why did Thorin have to die that stupidly? It's all so sad...Oh well, there's always hoping for Jackson to make a Silmarillion movie ;)"
" Intensely Boring
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,1,"If you like watching paint dry but wish it had really bad cgi, this movie is for you."
" No move has ever made me so mad
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,2,"From start to finish - awful. I don't even know where to begin. CGI is terrible. Storyline is terrible and makes no sense. Writing is horrible. Love story is cringe beyond belief. The thought process that went into putting more and more Alfred scenes in this movie in sacrifice of resolving plot holes and giving us more Bilbo, Gandalf, Beorn, and character development is baffling. I have never seen something so strange in film as someone creating something as masterful as LOTR trilogy to as sorry as TBOTFA."
" I hate it.. one of few worst things I've seen in cinema
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,3,"I still remember how I hated this movie, clichee mix of many battle sequences, too long too boring, idiotic fight scenes. Totally ruined smaug battle too plus more of elven dwarves romance... Absolute nonsense."
" The Battle of Studio Execs
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,3,"The original Hobbit book was a cute little 200-page kids story about being brave. It had songs and poems and talking bears.The studio wanted another Lord of the Rings cash cow, so they produced this 3-movie, 7.5-hour monstrosity. They simply didn't have enough story for more than a single 2-hour movie.The original Lord of the Rings was famous for it's use of New Zealand's scenery and real world artisan crafting for costumes. This movie just uses a ton of CG.There are numerous, boring, terrible add-on scenes meant only to bloat the run time and try to make ""Lord of the Rings 2: Now with More Dwarves""."
" This movie is a disgrace to the works of J.R.R. Tolkien
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,1,"Dear Peter Jackson,If you make a movie with ""The Hobbit"" in the title you may read the book with the very same title before doing so!"
" Epic
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,10,I love the final confrontation between Azog and Thorin because they had been enemies since the first film. It was sad to see Tauriel when she was laying beside the body of her lover Kili because she took care of him when he was shot by a orc in the second installment and he was beheaded by Azog and his son Bolg
" Dumb and Disappointing
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,4,"There's just so much wrong with this film it makes me kind of mad. There is way too much green screen and CGI making some of it look pretty bad. There's a lot of weird and bad lighting. There's so much stuff that makes no sense at all and is really unintentionally funny. The dialogue's pretty bad for a Middle Earth movie. Way too much unnecessary stuff that drags the movie down so much and really ruins the pacing. Not to mention the pacing is pretty bad also, I found the last 20 - 30 minutes to just be boring. It's really just a disappointing movie that really falls flat. Even the battle isn't great and it's definitely the weakest one in any of these movies. Anyway, it's not terrible as it still has stuff to like about it, obviously, but just bad and not much else."
" Should have stuck to the book.
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,9,Didn't like how they tried to make it too much like the Lord of the Rings in the complexity of the story and all the different things going on. The book is not like the other Lord of the Rings books. Its short. Its simple. Its fun and exciting. Much more lighthearted. They tried to make it dark and crazy with the weird evil mist guy and the white orc storyline. Not on the book at all. Made it unnecessarily complicated just so he could sttetch it into 3 movies the way he did LOTR. Also the she-elf captain. Unnecessary love interest added just for a tug at the heart string in movie 3. She wasnt in the book at all. Just odd. Should have stuck to the book on this one. Made it strange.
" The most entertaining.
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,7,"The battle sequences, though obviously cgi, are still epic. The best out of the three."
" Grand Finale!!!
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,10,"The hobbit trilogy comea to an end with this part.all characters did justice with their roles.
The Graphics is amazing..All living beings of the middle earth..men orc dwarf elf..gollum and hobbits all are there in the major battle.
Must watch for middle earth fans.."
" The worst aspects of modern blockbuster filmmaking
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,5,"If you ever wondered what a Lord of the Rings film would be looked like if directed by Michael Bay then The Battle of the Five Armies is the closest we are ever going to get. The Battle of the Five Armies was when the The Hobbit Trilogy fell apart. It was a last minute decision by the studio to turn The Hobbit from a two-parter into a trilogy and make turn five pages into a two and a half long film. Like any battle films, i.e. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2, Battle of the Five Armies was just relentless action.The film started off well enough with Smaug attacking Lake Town but it fell into fan-fiction territory. The film brought in Elrond, Saurman, and Galadriel to save Gandalf, have fan-service moments involving Legolas, and the reference to Aragon at the end.Whilst Lord of the Rings was high fantasy, there was a certain level of realism with the battle scenes. The original trilogy used a mixture of effects. The final The Hobbit film was too dependent on CGI effects and many things were over-designed like the Trolls with artificial limbs, Trolls with catapults, and dwarves riding on mountain goats. Billy Connolly looked like he was from a video game.One of the worst features of the film to me was the role of Legolas. Because of his role in LotR there was no fear of peril for the character and he seemed to do more superhuman feats in this film than in any of the previous ones."
" Fantastic conclusion to the trilogy
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,9,"This is my favorite of the hobbit movies with epic action scenes, good visuals, great acting, interesting characters, well written script, and the pacing is better than the other two while still having the nice moments with the characters. The only flaw is that some of the dwarfs when they die don't work cause they don't develop them well so they kinda fall flat. Still a great conclusion and is one of my favorite of the middle earth movies."
" Emotionally satisfying ending to the series!Its Epic and incredible!
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,10,"It was full of awesome wars and fight with nail-biting situations,the music,visuals and action's it was literally incredible,the Dragon destruction was intense with amazing slay,the Blindness by Gold and the realization of Dwarf's king and the Bilbo's sweet and simple life terms changing everything at last it was great,the whole last act was edge-of-seat emotionally intense war sequence it was awesome as hell in between it the politics was amazingly showcased.the ending was little heart-breaking although it was satisfyingly amazing with Bilbo' s completed arc!It's the Incredibly Epic and satisfying conclusion to the prequels trilogy it was better than 1st movie and its literally worth experiencing it's a great movie!"
" What?
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,2,"Horrible. Absolutely horrible. Terrible plot, major alterations to the book, too much bad CGI. No need to say any more on this. Do not waste your time on this garbage."
" A phenomenal movie 8/10
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,8,"""The Battle of The Five Armies"" is the final chapter of ""the Hobbit"" trilogy, though people will prefer the LOTR trilogy, I enjoyed both of them and think they give a rich story to the world Tolkien has wrote. This movie was a blast, so many great intense moments and remarkable dialogue and chemistry between the characters. The main event of the movie was of course the battle of the five armies. One spectacular sequence that continues till the very end of the movie. One thing that bothered me with the beginning of the film was the quick death of Smaug the dragon. I think it would have been smarter to Keep him for the battle. So I feel the writers wasted some potential with this character. Martin Freeman gives a good performance, ian Mckellen is great as always, Richard Armitage does a great job as Thorin. The rest of the casting is fantastic and we got a nice closure to the trilogy that summons up to the timeline of the LOTR. Which is amazing cause we get a nice clear ending to the whole story. Both trilogys. A fabulous movie that is most recommended and delivers a tearful experience."
" A trilogy that shouldn't have been
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,5,"Since Peter Jackson's highly anticipated, yet underwhelming, return to Middle-Earth in 2012 with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, many devout fans have given Peter Jackson the benefit of a very substantial doubt that he could still churn out an outstanding Tolkien film, myself included. But with Bilbo's swan song here, that hope is sadly extinguished, like the glory and splendor of the town of Dale.The Battle of the Five Armies suffers from that which plagued The Hobbit trilogy since the beginning: bloated excess and a complete lack of focus. How Jackson and Warner Bros. justified stretching Tolkien's breeziest, most accessible text into three movies will forever escape me.The film opens where The Desolation of Smaug should have closed, had Jackson shown just a hint of economy with this trilogy, as that silver-tongued dragon lays waste to Laketown and subsequently falls to the arrow of Bard the Bowman. Bilbo, our supposedly titular hero, is yet again sidelined in favor of Thorin and his merry band. This is surely Jackson's biggest folly throughout this trilogy. Too often it has felt that we are watching The Dwarf instead of The Hobbit. Martin Freeman was never given the chance to truly come into his own as Bilbo Baggins, though he hardly be faulted for that. He gave the character everything that he could, and in the few instances where he has been allowed to shine, Freeman knocks it out of the park.The eponymous battle also disappoints. It does not nearly match the action, bravura, or emotional stakes raised by, say, the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in Return of the King or Balin's Tomb in Fellowship of the Ring. Instead we are presented with something that looks more appropriate as a video game cutscene as thousands of faceless Elves, Dwarves, Men, and Orcs slam into each other. Yet Jackson eschews much of the climactic battle in favor of one-on-one fisticuffs between Thorin and his CG Orc nemesis, Azog, as well as the inexplicably shoehorned Legolas in an overwrought, physics-defying deathmatch that spawns more eye-rolling. We never get the impression that there is much at stake, nor the understanding that Elf, Dwarf, and Man put aside petty squabbles and greed to unite against a greater enemy, a point that Tolkien so beautifully delivered.In the end, I just did not care about what happened to these characters. I wanted to love these films, as I loved The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Gone are the days, it seems, in which Peter Jackson was wholly invested in bringing Middle-Earth to vivid life. Here he has fallen prey to the George Lucas effect. I longed for the gorgeous aerial shots and locations in New Zealand as opposed to endless over-polished glistening greenscreen cinematography. I miss the outstanding prosthetics and make-up that have been forsaken for CGI. For my part, there is no soul in this Hobbit, and the end result begs the question: If Guillermo del Toro had stayed in the director's chair, what would he have done differently?"
" THE HOBBIT
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,7,"Relative to 1 and 2, Part 3 is slightly longer and doggerelier, and Thorin's awakening is a bit stream-of-consciousness and simply brutal. The home is behind, the world is ahead, and it's hard not to get excited.
The film's original character, Tauriel, has been criticized from the beginning, but it is only now that PJ's intentions are understood, and not only does Tauriel play the role of Legolas's sensibility, infatuation, and athleticism, but also, at the end of the film, the camera switches back and forth between Tauriel/Kili and Bilbo/Thorin, making it clear that PJ's intentions are clear.
Unfortunately, aside from a few minor laughs, the Battle of the Five Armies doesn't do much to impress. There are few scenes that go straight to the heart of the audience."
" Rehashed, drawn out, and lack of story
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,5,"Peter Jackson should have stopped while he was ahead and not attempted The Hobbit films at all. This was no where near the caliber The Lord of the Rings trilogy was (still is). This trilogy is easily forgettable with it's drawn out, rehashed battle scenes, same old formula of what they used in the Return of the King battle scenes. More than the battle scenes, there was a severe lack of a strong story by the start of the third film.
The scenes with finding the Necromancer/Sauron from both the second and third films should've been cut. It didn't help in any sort of way to look for the origins of a villain we already knew about."
" Impressive
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,8,"What an adventure, what a battle!
Excellent choice to shoot it in New Zealand"
" Best of 3!
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,9,"I did not bother seeing this movie when it came out because I was mildly disappointed with the first and more disappointed with the second.
After rewatching the first two I decided to finish the series and WOW am I glad I did. This one is so much better. It moves along smoother and the characters become more real. Enjoy!"
" Stellar Stuff
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,10,"The Tolkien books did not move me at age 10 like Sherlock and Nero Wolfe and PG Wodehouse , but 55 years later the 6 recent Tolkien films are fabulous , although fast forwarding is necessary at times . The music, scenery, costumes, actors, monsters, and all kinds of cinema magic is more than enough for a lifetime or two. The added relationships are very welcome and are wonderfully emotional in the films . Loving the films is easy , the books not much. Thanks to Peter Jackson and all involved.
PS the gollum thing gets old real fast (much fast forwarding ), as well
the spider scenes in the final LOTR film ,but Renee Fleming ,the eagles , and escaping morder was awesome . I would welcome a film about the life of Beorn ,and a film about aKili and Tauriel secret affair ,and their offspring ,or a later in life Legolas and Aragorn adventure with..."
" Absolutely Amazing!
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,10,"Whenever I'm watching Lord of the Rings I always find myself skipping bits but not with this movie. The Hobbit is by far a better movie series with better acting, better film quality, better CGI, better story. There is one scene in particular that I often find myself going back to because it is simply amazing!"
" Basically a video game walkthrough
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,7,"There should be an asterisk in the credits after it says ""Based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkien"" that says *loosely. The only parts that were in the book was the first 5 minutes. After that it went in an entirely different direction and did its own thing. The whole movie is essentially a 3-hour battle sequence and it looks like you're watching somebody play a video game, and it gets tedious very quickly. That being said, I'm kind of sad that the world of Middle Earth is finished. After ""Hunger Games"" ends next year, what other book franchises will there be left to adapt other than ""Maze Runner""? Nothing. It will force Hollywood to think of original ideas for once. Which I guess is a good thing, but at the same time I'm going to miss anticipating these movies and seeing them in a theater with like-minded fans. It's an emotional end to The Hobbit and the world of Middle-Earth and I'm sad to let it go.
Grade: C 7/10 3/5 stars"
" Overcooked CGI, undercooked story
",2020-03-21 00:00:00,7,"Let's see how many fantasy CGI characters and scenes we can get into one shot and forget about any kind of realistic story!

" One chapter to ruin them all.
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,1,"I'm gonna say it, I think that line there it better than the whole movie. One chapter to ruin them all. This is the trashiest culmination of flashy, gaudy, ostentatious garbage I've ever seen. They invented a gigantic albino character to just add screen time, then make up a fictitious 45 minute battle that was just ridiculous. A book that was about dwarves reclaiming a lost heirloom and ancestral home, turned into as many over the top battled as could be squeezed in between poorly written uneducated jokes.
What makes this whole ordeal worse, and I cant explain it to save my life, is how people are giving these movies a rating of 9 and 10. Compared to the original Lord of the Rings trilogy, these arent even coming to close to a 3. And only in a world where those first 3 movies didnt exist, MAYBE! we could say these arent absolute garbage. Tolkien loved untamed wild nature, and Mckellen wept bc he didn't even get to see his companions most of the time while filming. The use of green screens is appalling."
" CGI CGI CGI......................AND YET MORE CGI....
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,1,"I Sincerely Hope that The 7.4 Imdb Rating Is for The Cgi Not the Film as A Whole... Because That's Just What It Was a Messy Little Hole of A Film, Full of Holes and Wholly Unremarkable in Plot Characterisation ...Though the Actors Did Try to Rescue as Much as They Could but Were Hampered by There Being Nothing to Do Other than Dutifully and Seamlessly as Professionals Do, Being in The Right Place to Fit Into the Cgi Concept...As you can plainly see, the paragraph I now write is a lot friendlier, with more character, (sorrry about the pun!), than continuous in your face Capitalisation/CGI!!!! LOTR and Hobbit 1 show that you can do it!... so, more plot and reference to Tolkien in future please for even the least discerning children... let's feed them with something more substantial rather than dumbing down with endless candies even if you only get money from one or two films instead of 3..... it's about quality not quantity people..."
" The Hobbit
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,9,Good but it was dragged on a lot. A lot of people didnt like this movie but nothing can ever come close to LOTR and it will always be in its shadow. If LOTR hadnt been made yet this would have been a great movie but unfortunately it wasn't up to the same standard and should have been but you have to remember Peter Jackson will always be one of the best directors ever.Overall I think that this was a good movie but wasn't up to the standard that it should have been
" Bittersweet Ending
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,10,"The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies is as entertaining and mystifying as the first two movies in the series.I have seen these movies dozens of times and never get sick of it.As usual,the sets ,the acting,the bittersweet ending...all culminate into a classic.Forget those who didnt like the ending.Forget those who say its boring, or not as good as LOTR. I like The Hobbit series better!I love the dwarves,i loved the romance between Tauriel and Kili...the Elves ,Bilbo,and Bard! Bard plays the hero in this movie,the exact opposite he played in Beauty and the Beast...where he played an arrogant villain.Yes i cringed at the poor decisions Thorin made , and yes the ending isn't what we all wanted. But Bilbo(Martin Freeman) really makes the movie.You can nit pick all you want but Martin Freeman is a fantastic actor.They all were fantastic.Even Alfred the weaselly coward acts amazing.I cannot stress enough that this movie is excellent...the acting is how its supposed to be done! I felt what they felt...and grieved when they grieved.Honorable mention to Buffar, the kindly dwarve who sings,dances, privately helps Bilbo,and is a lovable but talented warrior! Don't pick this movie apart.Its fun and finishes the Hobbit series well.I personally love battle scenes,and there was plenty of it.I have to conclude this review with Legolas and his Elven King father.Their story moved me,and i wish they would make a movie that concentrates on the Elves. A+ MOVIE!"
" Unfortunately one of the worst movies I've seen
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,8,"In exact opposition of one of the reviews here, I enjoyed the first of the three hobbit movies the most and then desolation of Smaug next. I'm actually watching that one again now! So, I enjoyed the first two - whereas this other reviewer said they were underwhelmed by the first two but loved this one...Anyway, once I got to Five Armies, I was bored most of the way through, it felt like a bunch of zoomed out, CG fight scenes with no real emotion - just a money grab and an easy way to wrap up the story.I love LOTR, Peter Jackson, all that - this could have been as good as Return of the King but it was so far from it. I like most movies I watch and I was really disappointed. When I think back on the hobbit trilogy, I remember the first 2/3 but can't really remember how it ended...a shame"
" This is The Hobbit?
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,3,"OK this (actually all 3) movie(s) have very little resemblance to the book. If you have not read the book, then you may like these interpretations but if you've read the book, the half the time you will be wondering where THAT came from.
The Rankin and Bass animation actually was more true to the author's vision than these 3 monstrosities of movies are."
" Good movie...
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,6,"...should have been better.I haven't read the book, binge-watched the whole trilogy, I have seen and read LOTR. I'm flabbergasted.I did enjoy the trilogy as a whole quite a lot. It was an entertaining action fest set in LOTR-like scenery. I was even treated with quite a few characters which I recognized from LOTR. Story was easy to follow, and not too much shakycam or fast cuts were used. Several of the actors performed well enough, nothing really drew me out of story, untill last installment started unfolding right in front of my eyes. That's when it all came tumbling down.Now I'm sitting here wondering what went wrong? Was it the tone of the movie? Death and mayhem were treated quite humorously through the whole trilogy, important character deaths were dealt swiftly and efficiently. Movie was as violent as the trilogy as a whole, yet general tone felt almost comedic. Wasn't The Hobbit written for children?Characters representing good were god-like creatures, able to shrug off any injury except when plot required someone to die. Legolas and his love intrest were an unstoppable force of nature which put Matrix and its ilk to shame. I had to try to come up any excuse why any other characters were even fighting, just hunker down and let immortal terror-twins save the day? Dwarwes were faring just as well, kicking and head-butting armored orcs to death from left and right. I couldn't help wondering why they bothered to carry weapons at all. Rest of the elves, their superficial, greedy and vain king included were mere cannon fodder, as were the village folk. Maybe 10 years old Superman fan had created the script?Worst offender however for me was the last part of the trilogy. It felt like it was completely cgi. It felt like I was watching the last part of LOTR through a filter that switched the original characters with those taken from The Hobbit-trilogy. So, was this 10 years old Superman fan also some sort of computer geek, and told Jackson he could do all the work for the last part of the trilogy?Six stars for the reasons mentioned at the beginning of this review. Four stars missing because of the reasons mentioned at the latter part."

While, the other half of me really enjoyed it for what it is. It was the latter half that won out and bought the DVD Box Set. Sure, the movie strayed Extremely Far from the book. Oh well - this is what film makers do: They take great art and then ruin it by quickly whitewashing over the canvas with a really stiff brush. I've grown accustomed to this because it's been occurring my entire life, and such is never going to change. Therefore, one may as well accept what is and try to make the most of it! As movies go, this one was Incredible. Other than that, the script should be burned and rewritten in order to make the movie identical to the book. Fat chance!"
" The perfect ending to the Hobbit trilogy
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,8,"Well, we all know that the hobbit are not the lord of the rings, but its a wonderful and very fun ride trough the middle earth and this ending is perfect. I think that the extended edition is the difinitive cut of this movie, the theatrical realeased was very rushed and they cut wonderful scenes that they stand in this movie. And well this movie is thrilling and not stops, the battle of the five armies is awesome and all the characters have a good arc in this movie especialy thorin and bilbo, peter Jackson directs a battle scene like no one, even a prefer the battle of helms deep, but this one is diferent and enourmous. The bad parts are that sometimes thats have a lot os cgi and i know that is because of warner escheule and stuff but... man sometimes is just kind of bad, other things is some characters are forgotten and others that are not so important like alfrid have a lot of standard so... at the end its a very great movie i love the whole trilogy and im totally okay with this not being the lord.of the rings... because its the hobbit!"
" Action packed visual extravaganza
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,8,Rating8/10Fine conclusion to The Hobbit is long but action packed visual extravaganza. Top notch visual effects. Action scenes go on too long and occasionally become cartoonish.Entertaining spectacle is recommended
" Unecessary epilogue haphazardly slapped together. Only 10 minutes could be salvaged.
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,6,"Over-bloated, disappointing finale to Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth. I expected Desolation of Smaug to be the finale, no, they just decided to make 5 pages of the book a 3 hour movie with extreme liberties from the book, absolutely disappointing to say that this movie would be a bit better if you're drunk."
" I never cared
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,3,"Watching Lord of the Rings I cared about the hobbits and the companions. Here I never cared about the dozen guys in Halloween costumes or the dwarf who looked like a human leading man but lacked the charisma of Aragorn or the hobbit who looked like a human and lacked the charisma of Frodo.The movie was actually better than I remembered though I did fast forward through some of the worst of the CGI. Bard was almost interesting and the first hour felt like a movie generally. At some point it became a montage of video game cuts scenes until say the last 20 minutes. When compared to Lord of the Rings, it is amazing to think that the same creative team was behind it. I get the sense that much like Lucas, Jackson got lucky once and never will be able to come close to his masterwork."
" A Great and Satisfying Conclusion to a well-done Fantasy Trilogy!
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,9,"(This is a review for the Extended Cut)I don't know why some people don't like this film. Saw it in theaters, and I loved it. Watched the extended cut, loved it even more. I do have to mention that I think that the studio taking the film away from Peter Jackson and 'beefed it up' was unfair, especially since he is such a great director. However, I actually enjoyed the Kili-Tauriel romance and I think it works for the story.Having read the book (The Hobbit) several times before watching this film (and seeing the animated film several times as well), I knew what would happen at the end in regards to certain characters, especially Thorin. Yet the way the film was shot and scripted, it gave me the (albeit brief) idea that Thorin and his nephews would survive, adding extra emotion to the film for me. I thought that Smaug was also killed off too soon, especially after his spectacular iconic performance in the previous film. But his performance is still pretty brilliant.While Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen are great, as usual, in their swan songs as Bilbo and Gandalf, Richard Armitage is fantastic as the tormented and troubled Thorin Oakenshield. I felt bad for Balin, though, since if you have read the books or seen The Lord of the Rings trilogy, you know what his fate is. But he kind of wraps his role up with a blaze of glory in the Extended Cut. Orlando Bloom gives his character of Legolas much needed depth in this film with his performance as well, while Lee Pace is thoroughly detestable as the arrogant Thranduil. Evangeline Lily is great and kicks butt as Tauriel, and the story-arc with her and Kili is a nicely-done tragic love story. Luke Evans is enjoyable as Bard the Bowman, who gets a few great action scenes. Billy Connolly is, like Smaug, woefully underused in his performance...especially since he looks so freaking awesome as Dain Ironfoot.The titular battle of the film is incredible. As other reviewers mention, it is a little similar to the Battle of the Pelannor Fields/Siege of Minas Tirith sequences in Return of the King, but it fortunately is able to stand on its own as well. After a couple of times watching, I think the Extended Cut's R-Rating is justified with the iconic battle. There is a lot of gruesome blood splatters and arterial sprays. Especially when those goat chariots come out.Besides the battle itself, the other action scenes are breathtaking, most prominently the Rescue Mission to save Gandalf at Dol Goldur. The Nazgul are quite terrifying and demonic in appearance with their awesome-looking armor and it is a great choreographed battle. I enjoyed the climatic clash between Azog and Thorin, as well, despite knowing how it would end. I kind of wished Bilbo would have had more action scenes in the film, though...At any rate, this film is a great conclusion to the Hobbit Trilogy. I hope that the upcoming Amazon Middle-Earth series will live up to what Peter Jackson has accomplished, also, since there are so many other stories in the History of Middle-Earth to be told either in a streaming format or a cinematic format."
" Witness the defining chapter of the Middle-Earth saga.
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,9,"Rousing, muscular, and theme-rich, Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is a triumphant final chapter to his second Middle-earth trilogy. An action oriented spectacle replete with heart and soul, Jackson's film soars and easily finds a place in the canon of fantasy greats.Adapting and expanding on the final chapters of J.R.R Tolkien's ""The Hobbit,"" Jackson's film tells the story of dwarves, elves, hobbits, orcs, and men as they collide in an epic battle over homeland, riches, and, eventually, freedom. While Jackson and company's script takes liberties with the source material, adding characters, subplots, and adventures that go unseen in the literature, these liberties are reverent. The screenwriters steward Tolkien's world and words, fleshing them out in exhilarating and meaningful ways.The story, here, is lean and packed with up-tempo action beats. Underlying it all, however, are the themes of Tolkien's core narrative. Through dialogue and deed, Jackson weaves a tale of individuals wracked by destructive greed yet emboldened by legacy and the promise of reclaiming lost homelands. He tells a story of the importance of allegiance and the utmost need for friendship. As with the five films before, this is a story that promises even the smallest person can make a difference and that love and friendship are life's imperative driving factors.Jackson, once again, creates a world that is immersive. His Middle-earth is dangerous, cold, and murky; but it is also vibrant, robust, and alive. The film is a symphony of fantastic designs and beautifully rendered landscapes, sets, props, and costumes. Every artist and technician working on the film has a hand in molding something memorable. Jackson's camera swoops and stalks, capturing a world that is brilliantly rendered.Jackson's cast build characters that are just as well rendered. They are fantastic beings of all shapes and sizes, yet they are recognizably human. From Martin Freeman's put-upon Bilbo and Richard Armitage's glowering Thorin, to Ian McKellen's wizened Gandalf and Evangeline Lilly's powerful Tauriel, these are characters ideally communicated by their actors. They breathe life into Tolkien and Jackson's now-iconic creations.The film is swift and never sags. It moves from bold heights of heroism to moving moments of quiet sacrifice. It is whimsical, moving, and inspiring. Though its plot beats cover only a handful of pages from Tolkien's tome, the beats never feel over-stuffed or unnecessary. Jackson, guided by the essence of Tolkien's work, creates something thrilling, entertaining, and meaningful.It is with a heavy heart but tone of good cheer that Peter Jackson ends his excellent second Middle-earth trilogy. Though the events of these films may be trite compared to those of Jackson's first venture into Tolkien's realm, they are just as stunningly realized. ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" is a fully engrossing, fully enchanting, and fully spectacular experience. It is an ideal and bitter-sweet send off for Tolkien's beloved characters and a stellar end-note for Jackson's six-film magnum opus, narratively dovetailing with effortlessness back into Jackson first cinematic journey to Middle-earth and creating an amazing fantasy saga."
" Meh
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,5,"Unexpected journey was decent but doesn't age as well.
Desolation's 2nd half made it pretty damn good.
This one's easily the weakest. Cgi, acting, character logistics, etc. all feel pretty lackluster."
" The Least Appetising Film Title of 2014
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,7,"If your idea of fun is over two hours of orcs, dwarves, elves & sundry other hirsute warriors scampering about, engaging in long, portentous speeches and generally squaring up against each other then this is the movie for you.I actually read 'The Hobbit' as a kid and loved it. Turning Tolkien's charming little book into yet another sprawling trilogy in the wake of 'The Lord of the Rings' was obviously only ever a commercial decision (which was why the interminable 'The Desolation of Smaug' was so excruciatingly drawn-out). But at least the threatened massed battle is actually over fairly quickly and - although it as usual takes an awfully long time getting there - being the third part of a trilogy you know that things will, eventually, come to a proper conclusion this time round."
" A good movie, but stretched too thin
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,8,"The Hobbit trilogy of movies had the opposite problem of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In LOTR, the problem was condensing what could easily have been 20 hours of film into 9, so much was skipped or altered. In this trilogy, what should have been 4 hours of film got stretched into 9, and it left me feeling like the studio was milking the cow as much as they could. Nevertheless, if you loved LOTR, you'll want to see these too."
" Let your senses enjoy
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,8,"One of the best trilogy I have ever seen, in sum it's a masterpiece, composed of a blending action and humor - and even a bit of romance - to create a well-paced tale that ends up being almost as satisfying. ""The Hobbit"" is visually stunning in all its three-parts, beside the Oscar-worthy performance by Freeman as a Bilbo (Freeman was born to be a hobbit), also I couldn't ignore the great performance of all cast, the amazing music by Howard Shore that reprised from the previous trilogy and the genius director Peter Jackson who gave us this masterpiece trilogy.The disadvantage of ""The Hobbit"" is the ending of part 1&2, where the film ends with ellipses rather than a period, we know the story will be continued, but with a little effort and some clever writing, Jackson could make each chapter feel like its own complete story. The result is probably the most dissatisfying element of the film.""The hobbit"" is surely worth to watch, just let your senses enjoy, even If ""The Hobbit"" doesn't equal the achievement of Jackson's earlier Middle-earth movies."
" my notes
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,6,Awesome movie. action throughout. beastly scenes. didn't care much for the story (1 viewing)
" The best of Hobbit series.
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,9,"As for me, this film is the best one in the entire Hobbit series. It's not because it's the last film, just because it has some exciting fight scenes. The Hobbit series gives me a different taste. Mostly because the main character and his peoplr are shorter than normal people and so, they are cute. Just kidding. 😁 The main reason is it has a lot of awesome things.As the title says, the five armies. The elf army is the best. I can't believe that Legolas' father is such a coward. I can't even distinguish whether he wants to protect his people, he doesn't want to be part of the other people's businesses for no reason or he's just simply afraid. No matter what it is, he seems to be a coward, so, I don't like him that much.What I love is those awesome scenes where Legolas fight with the Orc. The scene he walks up by stepping onto the bricks when he's falling down is the best in the entire film. I totally can't take eyes from the screen when I saw it.To summarize, this film has a lot of fighting scenes and it's so cool. I can say that it's one of the best films I've ever watched."
" Awesome movie
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,8,"If you loved the Lord of the Rings, you will love The Hobbit! It will no doubt be a timeless classic that people will watch for generations to come! It is action packed, fantasy filled and thoroughly exciting. A must see for any fantasy fan."
" A deserving ending to a wonderful trilogy.
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,9,"A deserving ending to a wonderful trilogy. The Hobbit movies are not as dark as the LOTR, they are a little more charming and easy to follow. This does not take away from the grand scale of this movies world or the beauty of its tale. The Battle of the Five Armies started as it intended to end, the action sequences were again excellent and creative. There were many memorable moments which were both intelligent and spectacular. I never found it slow and the battles were indeed dramatic however it seems Peter Jacksons ideas have become a little more predictable when you constantly know whats coming at big moments. I love the home grown talent within this trilogy and it tied in beautifully with the LOTR. One of my favourite trilogies of all time"
" It's an adaption.
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,7,"I've always been too harsh on this film, though it doesn't follow the books as accurately as ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy followed their films and that I would have liked them too, I now think of this film as an adaptation, not an accurate depiction of the book, it makes me like a film that I would otherwise criticise for making things up that were not in the book.
The story lines are questionable in many places but the acting is constantly superb and the casting is spot on."

" Still hurts after all these years
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,1,"Clearly one of the (if not THE) worst big budget movie of this century. I went to the bathroom and for some food at points, like i missed 30minutes and when i came back i've just didn't miss a thing,because there was nothing to miss at all. Even when i watched i've just prayed for the end. This is just some chaotic sensless storyless fighing for 3 hours,and it's kinda easy to wow an audience with these scenes usually,but this one here is also unimaginably BAD. I'm not that type of guy who gives 1 star rating for something i don't like,but for me this is the movie that truly deserves, it's a shame on Hollywood and all the filmmaking industry. Just UNWATCHABLE!"
" Too many coincidences and lazy writing
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,6,"After watching the first two parts in the extended versions the time has come for the third one to close up and it disappointed greatly. By the end of the movie I realized that the authors just wanted to bring their story as close to the Lord of the Rings as possible (taking in consideration movies are prequels) but they executed it very poorly. The most powerful and strongest villain gets killed within the first fifteen minutes with a spear. The bravest and most selfless dwarf suddenly turns selfish and greedy only after a small talk to realize he got confused and turns good again. The elves who wanted to start a war because of the necklace only to end up helping everyone else and not getting the necklace after all. The armies that come to the battlefield at just the right time. The stones that pile up so perfectly while falling that the hero can jump on them and save his life. The immortal that falls in love apparently for the first time in god knows how many years she lived already and feels its pain. And the snowball goes on and on. In a word, the whole Hobbit trilogy is absolutely unnecessary to watch because a) its story is NOT interesting one bit, b) the authors simply parasitize on the legacy of the superior movies and c) three movies can be easily turned into one three hour movie without the loss of quality but it still won't be a good movie. The Hobbit is just another cash-grabber like any other sequel/prequel/reboot that's coming out nowadays and doesn't bring anything knew or meaningful to the cinema world whatsoever."
" A boring disappointment.
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,3,"The movie is a bizarre and incoherent slaughterfest riddled with errors. It sometimes feels like every scene lives in a separate universe, none of which adhere to basic physics.Losely based on the book at best."
" Arkenstone...Lonely Mountain..Dwarf King...
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,6,"So... if you go back 9 hours before the utterly disappointing ending to this trilogy, it all started with a quest to find the Arkenstone to allow the dwarf king to unite the dwarves and reclaim their mountain. Bilbo was 1 of 14 members of this group. Now.. before you all jump on the title..Hobbit...I can't help but with the ending I've just seen, feeling a bit robbed. Like seeing the prequels to Star Wars... they didn't tell us the whole story. We already knew that Bilbo found the ""precious"" ring in a cave with Golem. That was shown in an odd 15 minute still confusing game of riddles. Yet after 9 hours of catastrophe and trials to get to the mountain, we lose the king, the Arkenstone was never mentioned again after they offered it in trade, and Bilbo says bye in 15 seconds and walked home. I feel seriously cheated out of an ending that should have been different. Also... the Five Armies? Dwarves, Elves, Orcs, Humans.... and??? A Hobbit? Just not what I expected to a few years wait to see the trilogy."
" , the two big scenes of shooting dragons and decisive battles are disappointing
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,5,"Generally speaking, the two big scenes of shooting dragons and decisive battles are disappointing. Fifth Army War, Orcs, Dwarfs, Elves, Humans, who is the fifth? Are those mob refugees also ranked first? The magicians in Western magic settings use wands to pull people up?"
" A fitting if not messy conclusion to a fitting if not messy franchise.
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,7,"This is probably the most action packed Middle-Earth film to date which is a shame because it is also the weakest. Now to say it is bad would be a disservice to the effects team and the actors but there is a lot this film leaves to be desired. Let me just get right into it by saying Thorin is at his best in this movie, I felt in the first two instalments he was a little too broody and whiny and although he still is it works a lot better in this film. His struggle with power and living up to the expectations of his family and friends is fascinating here due to no small part Richard Armitage's performance. Once again Martin Freeman is excellent but is most underused in this one. The opening sequence with Smaug decimating Lake town is thrilling, beautiful and as good as the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings gets but it is the height of the film in my opinion and the rest feels a little underwhelming in comparison. Azog vs Thorin was satisfying as we've been waiting for the rematch since the first film even if it's conclusion is bitter sweet. A little side note is the extended R-rated version of this film has a lot of gory extras which are a nice change of pace for the series and if you're old enough I recommend this version. The last thing I'd like to talk about is fittingly the end, this film does the goodbyes a lot better than Return of the King did, my biggest critique of that film was always its overly long endings and this film is very to the point and I like that, it also perfectly links up with the Fellowship of the Ring for all the marathon men and women out there. This film is all over the place in almost every aspect, tone, writing, pacing, ect. but I think the things I mentioned earlier in my review stop it from being a complete disaster. For now I'm going to give The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies a (very) generous score of 7.2. See you in my Lord of the Rings reviews!"
" Loved it!
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,10,Was long and drawn out but enjoyed every second. Doesn't keep to the original but is adventurous in its variations.

",2019-01-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie was awesome, i love it. Peoples are saying that this was so ""bad and disappointment"" I think they are not even true LOTR fans. Everything in this movie was good, plot, effects, fights... ONE OF MY FAVORITES MOVIES!!!
THE LAST BATTLE WAS GOOD, SO MANY ARMIES AND SO MANY GOOD ALLIANCES!! And when dwarves came out mountain, it was SO SICK"
" For illiterates only
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,1,"Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptations are all among the worst literary adaptations ever. For Tolkien fans they are a torment.

" A masterpiece
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,10,"This film was my favorite of ""the Hobbit"" sequel and just as favorite as ""the Fellowship of the Ring"". I don't get the critical reviews I read. The actors were unbelievably good and well cast - I couldn't think of a better Thorin than Richard Armitage or Thranduil than Lee Pace, or really anyone else who they cast. The picture truly makes you hold your breath and ask for more. I wish J.R.R. Tolkien has written more novels so Peter Jackson can make more movies .."
" The Hobbit Has Ruined Middle-Earth
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,7,"The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies was totally inaccurate to the much loved, already created fantasy story. Thorin dying was the only thing they got correct in this film. At the beginning, they were still raiding Smaug's Mountain but they weren't there for that long in the books. I don't have anything else to say."

" Really Good.
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,10,"I understand the bad reviews to an extent. Only to the extent that subplots not in the books were introduced, while other parts (in the books) were left out. But that was a fault of all three movies, so why is this film rated the worst!? I found this film to be perfect; by far the best of the three. The action was marvelously detailed, and the filmography and acting was superb. It ended very nicely, and started excitingly straight-off. I see no reason for criticism on this film other than on the page-to-screen flaws."
" Will Leave You Wanting More
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,3,"There's a lot wrong with the Hobbit trilogy, but my main gripe with it is all the CGI. If I wanted to see all these computer generated things fighting each other I would just play an xbox game. I came here to see a story told well and the Hobbit does not accomplish that.The fact that the death of Smaug is so rushed at the start is very anti climatic. It sets a strange pace for the rest of the running time. This did not need to be three films but Peter Jackson clearly just wanted the cash grab. It's just so dissapointing after the flawless Lord of the Rings movies he made and it just leaves you with an empty feeling, wanting more.The actors are great but you cant expect them to save a dumpster fire like this movie. Complete let down."
" A bloated conclusion
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,7,"This review contains spoilers.The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the conclusion to the Hobbit trilogy. This movie is the sequel to The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. The movie follows the group of Dwarves as they enter the Lonely Mountain and prepare to fight a battle. The Battle of the Five Armies is directed by Peter Jackson.The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is still as bloated as the previous movie, The Desolation of Smaug. This is a massive problem pas it makes the movie narratively vapid. Much of this causes the movie to be fun to look at, but the scenes do not have much natural weight behind it. Even the massive battle in this movie that is built up across the series had nothing going for the narrative. There is much going on in this movie but it did not feel fulfilling.The entire plot with Thorin telt superfluous like the previous movie felt with its story-lines. The movie should have focused on this story and tried to hint at it more in the previous movies. The plot should have focused on what the book focused on instead of the new characters the movie features.Once again the movie is impressive visually in both the standard frame rate and 48 frames per second. Anyone that really watches this move for the visual eye-candy will enjoy it. There are many sequences in this movie that are pretty to look at. The Laketown and battle sequences are the highlights here.The love plot with Tauriel and Kili reaches its conclusion here. As expected the plot lead nowhere. This plot like the rest of the movie was not fulfilling for the narrative as this event just happens. I believe that if the re-shoots did not happen this would make the movie better.Overall, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is a bloated mess. I would still recommend watching it for the conclusion to the Hobbit Trilogy.Grade: C"
" Quite lovely
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,8,"There's a lesson for filmmakers in the fact that Peter Jackson's best foray into Middle Earth was also his smallest.The Fellowship of the Ring introduced filmgoers to hobbits and the shire, elves and Rivendell, wizards and balrogs. But it did so on a smaller scale than that of later films, focusing on the journey of a few protagonists. Ironically, restricting the characters and locales magnified the sense of drama, and heightened the tension. We actually cared about what happened to the fellowship.As the films grew in scope and grandeur, as makeup and models were replaced by pixels, that sense of precariousness (preciousness?) was lost. The climactic battles in Return of the King involved, first, a computer-generated horde of ghosts swarming a computer-generated horde of orcs, and then a computer-generated horde of orcs being swallowed by a computer-generated earthquake.Jackson has ignored the lessons he should have learned from making The Lord of the Rings. His Hobbit flicks are comically overstuffed, a seven-hour epic drawn from the shortest of Tolkien's Middle Earth books and filled with plotlines that appeared nowhere in the original text. With Battle of the Five Armies, the series culminates in a multi-hour depiction of violence that in the novel takes up just a few pages.Many have likened the action of this battle to a video game cut scene-the portions of a game in which there is no actual gameplay, just animation revealing a piece of the plot or a bit of adventure taking place elsewhere. This is both accurate and overly generous. At least most cut scenes are a minute or two in length."
" The weakest of all Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptations
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,5,"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies is the weakest of all Peter Jackson's Tolkien adaptations. Even though this is the shortest of the Middle-earth movies, the story drags on as if it were the longest. But I guess that's what you get when you stretch out one book into three movies. In addition, the battle scenes are so computer generated that they look like in-game cinematics. It's a shame that this film series had to end on this note."
" Worthless ending to an unnecessary trilogy.
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,1,"Garbage. Overlong and an insult to the book. This proves that the screenwriters might have read the book and said, oh screw this. We can do better. Well guess what? You couldn't. You blew it by making it a trilogy. You blew it by ruining the entire Bard vs Smaug scene. You blew it with the stupid love triangle. You blew it in every way possible. Just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. I will never watch any of these ever again."
" Weak trilogy only saved by aesthetics of battle
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,6,"I was kind of disappointed when i saw the first 2, even Smaug didn't impress me, the only movie I enjoyed was the last one due to the massive battle, it excited me and was intense made, nice shots and camera moves."
" Not good as expected
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,5,I read the novel before watching the movie. I didn't expect it will be that bad. Watching this movie was a waste for time and money.
" Amazing..... ly awful
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,1,"I had no idea that IMDB users were this stupid. If this movie got a 7.4, no rating on this site can be trusted. This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, if you can even say I've seen it considering I walked out after half an hour if that, no 2 more hours of screen time can save any movie this bad"
" Why so long
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,3,"I m fanatical with Tolkien, i would never consider even the first trilogy faithful to the books or good enough, except the depiction of the evil characters, but on the Hobbit i think Jackson really messed up everything, i agree completely with all the low star reviewers, there is no connection with the book at all, the book compared to Lord of the Rings is short (not even a trilogy), and Tolkien wrote it for his children. But let me tell you why all this ovestretching had happened, it happened because the producers know that the general public does not have a clue of the book, they never read it, or even cared about its existence, so they thought, who cares if the movies are not faithfull, just make three out of it, they re going to watch it anyway, thats the simple truth."
" How to kill a good book making a bad movie.
",2018-09-06 00:00:00,5,I like Peter Jackson but he screwed up a good story.
" TEA IS AT FOUR
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,8,"Warning: May contain plot spoilers for people unfamiliar with the story.The version I watched was only 2 hours and 10 minutes, a reprieve from the 3 hour marathons of bladder hell and missed scenes. The film picks up right where the other one leaves off, although it would have been nice to have included the last couple of minutes of the second one. After the defeat of the dragon, the film goes into about 40 minutes of badly scripted drama, which included lines used in previous films, making it a bit trite. I was looking forward to the battle which unfortunately consumed most of the remainder of the film. I reached a point I was wishing the battle scene to end, although the title of the film hints at what to expect.The use of characters not in the book creates some plot continuity issues as well as creating those that weren't. Peter Jackson creates personal drama in the film which was not in the books. His fight scenes which consume much of the film series are typically one line or paragraph in a four volume series. Clearly some aspects of the books have to go like a chapter dedicated to the care and feeding of Shadowfax. Personally in the middle of battle, I don't think that ring would have left my finger.As far as purchasing, I am a true fan and will patiently wait for all the series to be out on a special edition extended Blu-ray at an outrageous price I won't think about twice."
" Some good fun but too much new stuff and too many loose ends.
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,3,"I realize these films are several years old, but maybe this review will help someone who is considering spending a little money on PPV or DVD's. My advice: buy them on sale or watch for them on TV and use your DVR to speed thru all the commercials. I have read the entire LOTR saga, The Hobbit plus the trilogy, at least six times, and The Silmarillion once. I loved the original LOTR trilogy by Peter Jackson. My reaction to the three Hobbit movies? Meh. The first part of my headline above could really apply to all three Hobbit films, not just this extremely disappointing finale. There is way too much extraneous material that was invented by Jackson and his team, obviously in order to bloat a simple, 300-page story into almost nine hours of film. The story could and should have been told in one film, and had Jackson stuck as closely to the book as he tried to do with the LOTR, it probably would have been just as good as those films were. But instead we're ""treated"" to many unnecessary and often annoying embellishments, chief among them the idiotic ""romance"" between elf and dwarf. All that does is diminish the significance of the friendship between Legolas and Gimli in the LOTR, in my view. Battle scenes are overdone and repetitious, Legolas must really be Superman in disguise, trolls and giants can't really be such powder puffs in combat, and please, not the eagles again. Moreover, despite the bloated size of this trilogy, it manages to leave out some really important parts of the story, such as Beorn's role in the Battle of the Five Armies. Finally, for anyone who hasn't read the book, the last 30 minutes of BOTFA leaves them scratching their heads wondering what happened to all those people like Thurandil and Beorn and Bard, and what about the Necromancer and Elrond and Galadriel and Saruman? All these loose ends left dangling in the breeze after all that screen time is just inexcusable. If you want to spend some time with the Hobbit, you're much better off just reading the novel. Then go watch the original LOTR trilogy again."
" Should be cut into 10 minutes and added to second Hobbit movie
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,5,What i remember of reading the Book 20 years ago the main story is basically over after the first 10 minutes of this movie. After that they just tie up some loose ends and return home because this was actually the main event. The finale! This one feels like its just made to make a lot of money. Nothing more. Of course this movie is still entertaining but if i every watch the Hobbit Triology again i will stop watching after about 10 minutes into this movie because the remaining 2 hours are not worth watching a second time.
" It's no Return of the King, but it served its purpose
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,8,"I'm a little surprised by all the negative reviews here on IMDB. Sure, it's not as good as Return of the King but it did conclude the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and the dwarves in their quest to free the dwarves' ancestral home. There was action and thrills plus battle scenes that could make everything else look tame. The Hobbit trilogy may not be as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but it's still better than the Star Wars prequel trilogy. If you don't care for the Hobbit trilogy's theatrical cuts, at least give the extended editions a chance. You can find a boxed set of the extended cuts at any movie store. I watched them and enjoyed all of them, especially the third one. They're a little long but they're worth it. Anyway, I'm getting off-topic here. There are some creative liberties taken, but don't let that throw you off. It's a decent conclusion and don't be too judgmental or expect a lot. Just expect to be entertained, all right?"
" The best of three
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,8,"The best of three, I managed to watch it in one breath, but I'm still not thrilled. The whole trilogy leaves the impression of a pale copy of the ""Lord of the Rings"".8/10"
" LOTR vs The Hobbit
",2018-04-25 00:00:00,9,"I feel many user reviews have been unfair to Jackson as they seem to summarily dismiss the Hobbit series altogether as one monumental redundancy. I've watched both the LOTR trilogy and The Hobbit series with equal delight, but I loved the latter more. I found the premise of LOTR too abstract and surreal giving a hint to the over imaginative mind of Tolkien. I felt the same with Rowling after the sixth part of Harry Potter was out. 
It seems painfully fantastic. What with the sinistrously powerful ring which is hell bent on reaching its benevolent master, the hideous eye constantly guarding Mordor, and poor Frodo constantly overwhelmed and under prepared for the herculean task he has undertaken, his life tottering on the brink of his grave- the film gets altogether depressing as it progresses and ends with a rather predictable climax. The final part is a whopping four hour long of ass numbing misery. I just wanted it to end. Even the Orcs in LOTR are predictable and stupid. Like petty toy soldiers they are prolific in numbers but lacking in wit, fighting other people's battle unlike in Hobbit where they appear sinistrously ghastly and macabre. They also had a leader with brains. Hobbit is beautifully directed in three parts. First is a nail biting adventure which keeps you hooked throughout. In the second, we've the inimitable Benedict Cumberbatch playing Smaug, the most fearsome dragon, who is nothing short of being brilliant, and in the final part we get to see the Dwarf King Thorin Oakenshield played by the versatile Richard Armitage in his full element. The scene where the dwarves decide to join in on the battle is a classic. It pumps my adrenaline everytime I see it. ""Will you follow me for the one last time?""Since I watched the Hobbit first, I missed terribly the presence of dwarves in LOTR although Gimli was brilliant. Battle of the five armies is a pure nail biter. It moves with a swift thrilling pace, and is definitely not clichéd. Technically, it precedes LOTR, and however much Jackson may have experimented with the adaptation, it all unfolds wonderfully making it an instant classic."
" Short Hobbit Trilogy Review
",2018-04-11 00:00:00,7,"Unfortunately, The Hobbit did not know what it wanted to be. It jumped between being the fun adventure that the book is to being a dark brooding setup for the LOTR trilogy. Far too many extraneous side stories found their way into this overly long and bloated children's story. The film should have been cut down to one 3 hour or, at the most, two 2 hour movies. Filling up some extra minutes with some Middle Earth backround information was ok, but a lot of extra junk that was unnecessary was thrown into this trilogy and especially into the Desolation of Snaug. In all honestly the best parts of these films were the stuff that was taken directly out of the book."
" The Legendarium who could have been better
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,7,"The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five armies was a movie I both longed to see but also dreaded to see. For knowing that it was the last of the Hobbit movies I felt sad that the adventure in Middle-Earth was about to come to an end but at the same time I felt excited to see how the ending would turn out. Having read The Hobbit book before the movie came out I already knew which characters would die, and what would happen in the main parts of the story but still I looked forward to see it all on the big screen. I liked both of the two other movies and have always looked at the movies and books in separate ways as I believe the two mediums are simply too different to compare with each other. However for me this movie sadly failed on many levels, and the only thing keeping it together was the continuing excellence of the actors. The overuse of CGI really killed a lot of magic in this movie and I've heard it did so for many others as well. CGI was of course used in both Desolation of Smaug & An Unexpected Journey but not as much and in the same way as it was used here. It felt as if the production was very rushed and sadly this caused many things to simply be replaced by CGI and pointless scenes of action. And the many scenes with Legolas also annoyed me as even though I like the character and the performance of Orlando Bloom, it simply felt that it was far too much and that focusing so much time on a character who are not even mentioned in the book just felt wrong and misplaced. It is really a shame that the production company did not give Peter Jackson and crew more time to give this legendarium the ending it deserved, as it felt that much could have been improved. The scenes that are good in the movie are however very good, as once again the amazing actors/actress delivers great performances. However all in this movie ends a very unique trilogy and even though it is the weakest of the three it is still a movie that all lovers of fantasy should see (If you have watched the other two). 7/10 Good!"

" Great
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,10,"The best of the trilogy, the most amazing and breathtaking one"
" Too much going on, but an adequate resolution to this trilogy
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"The third - and final - Hobbit film is a valiant attempt to recapture the 'Lord of the Rings' magic of Middle Earth, but too often feels tired and repetitive, especially in the sixth film in the franchise. It's by no means bad, it's just - as with the first two Hobbit films - unnecessarily padded, with lots of flashbacks and scenes of staring into the distance. I'm still not convinced the three Hobbit films couldn't have worked as one cohesive 3 & a bit hour film...Even though the second film featured his name in the title, Smaug (Cumberbatch) is quickly dealt with and the plot hastily progresses to be about the humans - led by Bard (Evans) - tying to move into the Mountain with the Dwarves - led by Thorin (Armitage) & a mostly redundant cameo from Dain (Connolly). To complicate things, the Elves - led by Legolas (Bloom)'s dad - show up too and then the Orcs arrive. By my count, that's four armies. The fifth army never really eventuates... Gandalf (McKellen) & Bilbo (Freeman) are left stuck in the middle of all this.There's some quick appearances from Elrond (Weaving), Galadriel (Blanchett) & Saruman (Lee), which are unnecessary and don't add to the plot. There's some good battle scenes, but nothing to top 'The Two Towers' or 'The Return of the King'. Some mild humour thrown in, but a lot of the film feels bogged down and aware it's ""the defining chapter"" or ""the final farewell"" as it's been billed.Plenty of frustrating moments - Tauriel (Lilly)'s ""romance"" with Kili (Turner), Thorin's ""dragon sickness"", the get-out-of-jail-card that the Eagles pose. Despite these, the score is still great, with the use of the familiar motifs still effective and the cinematography beautiful."
" A clumsy ending
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,6,"The Battle of the Five Armies title is a great exaggeration of what an army entails. The movie is about more or less a skirmish with some rather imaginative weaponry. The plot goes sideways and after two three hours long previous films we get a two hours and a half mess that is half completely over the top battle scenes and the other half people talking out of their asses. It is pure chaos, where orcs are either mighty unbeatable beasts bred for war or cardboard armor wearing morons easily defeated by fishermen's wives and children, as the action demands. Things start to remind of Pirates of the Caribbean, and not only because it's the same actor doing kind of the same stuff. There is even a prolonged ending with Bilbo Baggings returning to the Shire, almost as if wanting to undo the good idea in the Lord of the Rings movies in which they removed the boring book ending with Saruman taking refuge in the Shire, and that portrays hobbits as petty bureaucratic creatures, rather than kind and resilient and courageous as declared everywhere else in the films. If I enjoyed the first two movies and wanted to see how it will all end, the third was a ridiculous failure, trying to do too much with too little: making a country brawl look like an epic battle, keeping the lighter more children oriented tone while killing characters and trying to express deeper heroic emotions, trying to somehow raise on the same level three organized military groups and a bunch of fishermen and animals and tying up lose ends that were there only to make this a trilogy rather than a pair of decent movies. It is now when all the jokes about the eagles made in good fun in the first two movies (and in Lord of the Rings as well) turn smirky, when the only logic to the plot and action seems to be the panic of production companies trying to achieve their financial goals rather than tell a good story. It is here where the disappointment that everyone talks about when referring to The Hobbit movies raises its ugly head and grows on the small mistakes of the previous two movies. So in order to enjoy the trilogy, one must somehow detach themselves from the ending and see it as an imperfect finish to an otherwise fun movie, maybe imagine their own."
" The Hobbit The Battle of the Five Armies: Despite being the most poorly received it stands as my favorite
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,9,"I was distinctly underwhelmed by the first two Hobbit movies, I thought they were good but just that ""Good"". They live in the shadow of the Lord Of The Rings movies and simply paled in comparison and so going into The Battle Of The Five Armies I expected more of the same.According to both IMDb and the profit margin this was the most poorly received of the franchise, clearly people did not like the film by comparison. But as usual, I have to be different.I consider this to not only be the best of the Hobbit franchise but also hot on the heels in quality as the LOTR trilogy.The story culminates beautifully and if you can get past the many changes that were made you'll see the finale of a wondrous tale and a battle on screen that blew me away.Once again the fantastic cast, stunning score, mind blowing effects and sheer beauty envelope you into the world of Middle Earth and I was gripped.Yes its not flawless, but it is pretty damn close.The Good:Amazing openingAction scenes are brutalJames NesbittEvangeline LillyThe Bad:Still a lot of changesFili's death was poorly done"
" Ruined a great series
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,2,"What I liked1. The last fifteen minutes were actually touchingWhat I didn't like1. Smaug dying in the first five minutes2. The action is generally very boring3. The deaths are just not that close to the book4. Nothing justifies any of the events of the filmOverall this film would probably closer to being a five out of ten or something in reality, but I don't really like this film without thinking about the book and that is why I can over give it a two and in good sense."
" As with Hobbit 2, I watched this with family who chose it, not me; it is, nevertheless, entertaining, scary and more
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,7,"Picking up after Hobbit 2, the dragon has been tricked into giving up his gold and he is very angry. Therefore, he decides to punish Laketown again and burn it to the ground, killing all. However, Bard (Luke Evans) has a magic arrow and one chance to fell the fire- breathing beast. He does so, hooray! But, some have been killed and part of the town lost. Now, however, there is a new threat. Thorin (Richard Armitage), the leader of the dwarfs, does NOT want to honor his promise to share the treasure. This leads to a great battle of five armies, including the cretin-like Orcs, dimwitted but strong. Gandolf cannot immediately help, as he has been captured by a powerful necromancer. Yet, the eagles free him and the armies begin fighting. Which army will prevail? Who knows, but Bilbo just wants to go home. This exciting ""last chapter"" has some strong scenes of violence, which may not be suitable for the youngest viewers. Especially impressive is a battle on an icy, mountainous terrain. In general, good defeats evil and it is a joy to watch Bilbo (Martin Freeman) return to his meadow home, only to find he must stop the auctioning of his possessions, as the town gave him up as lost forever. Having seen the world, Bilbo rests peacefully in his rocking chair, with a special memento from his journey, a memento which will be important later. Again, actors, scenery, costumes, story, and direction are entertaining. No, these fantasies are most likely not the ""cup of tea"" for all but don't miss out if you get the chance to view it."
" An action packed conclusion to The Hobbit trilogy
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,7,"After the events portrayed in 'The Desolation of Smaug' the dwarfs, under Thorin Oakenshield, have taken control of the mine under the Lonely Mountain and searching for the 'Arkenstone', not knowing that Bilbo Baggins has already found it. Meanwhile the dragon Smaug has attacked and destroyed Lake Town before being slain by Bard the Bowman. After this Bard becomes the leader of the survivors as they head to the Lonely Mountain expecting the dwarfs to help them. Thorin, affected by Dragon sickness, refuses and barricades the entrance. Soon a force of Elves turns up hoping to retrieve their own treasure from the mountain; they ally with the human forces and prepare to attack. Just as they are about to strike a large army of dwarfs arrives to help those in the mountain. That is the least of their worries; Orcish forces are also attacking and soon men, dwarfs and elves are fighting side by side.This is a solid enough conclusion to the Hobbit trilogy which goes some way to link this trilogy to the 'Lord of the Rings'. The story is pretty simple and there are few real surprises just lots and lots of action. This action is pretty good for the most part although occasionally the CGI is a little obvious. The characters are mostly 'more of the same' with familiar characters battling the evil orcs. Alfrid Lickspittle, a character who lives up to his name, was a fun addition as the cowardly sidekick to the late ruler of Lake Town although why Bard trusted him for most of the film is a mystery as he shows his true colours at every possible opportunity. The cast does a solid job bringing the characters to life and the various CGI creatures look believable. Overall this film provided plenty of action although I'm not sure it was really necessary to turn a short book like The Hobbit into three films with lots of new material."
" Not that great...and it doesn't age well
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,6,"The conclusion of the book is pretty satisfying. The movie, not so much. One of the things I hate about ""modern"" movies is the way that game scenes are built into the movie. It's obvious which ones will be part of games and it detracts from the film.The invented characters and scenes do not add to the story in this movie. In fact, they take away from the main plot: absolute wealth corrupts as much as absolute power does.In the book the battle is well-written. The ""armies"" are actually more like large companies and the battle takes place in front of the mountain. In the movie, the armies are vast (especially the Orcs, who somehow have tens of thousands of soldiers and move them across vast tracts easily...during daylight no less) and spread out into the ruined town of Dale and the surrounding mountains.The result is a haphazard mess that Jackson admits he just ""winged"". He should have spent more time making two well-written movies instead of three rushed ones.One of the most unfortunate outcomes is that it's highly unlikely that the estate will green light a series of movies based on the Silmarillion. Well, at least not with Jackson."
" A Great Story done to death by sequels
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,3,"Am I the only one who grew up with the Hobbit and LOTR, and loved the first films, but now hates the series with a passion? I mean, I can still watch these movies, but the sequel explosion is just getting ridiculous. I find myself numbed to the CGI panorama of wacky stuff going on. Every one of these movies now looks the same, and they have done so many creatures, battles, and scenes with CGI on a monster scale, with unrealistic physics, that I am no longer intrigued by them. It is like watching one long video game sequence, trying to outdo the last Transformers or latest Fast and Furious or Michael Bay disaster movie.The story-telling component and acting have been replaced by a homogenous visual tapestry of confusing(yet spectacular) effects. Don't get me wrong, Jackson makes great films, but this whole series is getting redundant, and every new release of the Hobbit movies looks and feels the same to me. It is like a fairy tale video world on acid, lacking in emotional or plot-driven depth or character development and real-world charisma. I find myself bored with this overdone pile of visual antics.Also, Sam and Frodo in the first 3 films were practically dying to french kiss or something. Are they secretly lovers? I liked the stories and read some of them as a kid, but the movies with Photo Saggins and Sam hamming it up really killed an otherwise great story, while we are on the subject of goofy LOTR junk. Overall, I like LOTR, but these sequels and prequels are getting as bad as Disney taking the helm for Star Wars and doing it to death."
" Something is missing
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,5,"When I see these movies I feel something is missing that where present in the Lord of the Rings movies which made those movies, even though they also had their faults, so much better. The films feel very stressed, like they are rushing through without any pause. There are very few scenes whore the character just sit and talk or walk and talk without anything really happening, where you can learn more about the character and the world. Lord of the rings had a lot of those scenes which I liked. There are instead a lot of extra action scenes thrown in which could work, but I feel it is a bit to much. The atmospheric slower scenes are removed for more action. Then some scenes which could have been really good are just cut short. Like when they are with Beorg or lost in the forest.I think its OK to trow in more characters an focus on Legolas more. I think the best character in the whole movie is the Elf king. I love him so much. But one thing that I strongly dislike is that many of the Dwarfs have very few lines and you don't really get to know them during all 3 movies. I remember the scene towards the end where you say goodbye to all the remaining 10 Dawrfs and I remember thinking: ""who are some of these characters?"" I hardly remember who some of them look like or who they where. In that sense I think its to much focus on other aspects around the Dwarfs quest that the quest itself which makes the story feel like its all around the place. But I think there are some really good and strong scenes in this movie, but the movies all and all is missing something."
" The third time did not leave a charmed life.
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,3,"Less is more, and there was plenty of that in the tightly made first two Hobbit movies, as good as any of the well planned Lord of the rings series. I realized within the first half hour that the series should have concluded with the end of Smaug, moving this third series into outlandish and convoluted messiness after the second film's fist wrenching cliff hanger was resolved within 20 minutes of this film. Suddenly, there's a bunch of new threats to keep Thorin from taking back his mountain as humans, elves, dwarfs and Smaug's evil ogres fight. In the meantime, I began fighting a huge headache, and I blame the over ambition for this entry for giving it to me.Certainly, the idea of the end of one battle leading to others is promising drama, having been evidenced in real history. But none of what transpires here is in ""The Hobbit"" in my memory of having read it at least three times. This shows as much desperation in the desire to continue the franchise that has turned ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" series into an abysmal joke.Characters that you rooted for in the first two films are pretty much destroyed here, and the voice of Smaug continues to pop up, not only to haunt Bilbo Baggins but to voice villainous characters as well. The lack of loyalty to the original novel is very apparent, turning this into an obnoxious cliché of different levels of magic represented for both good and evil. Films like this take away my confidence in the modern Hollywood method of making movies, and reminds me why I avoid movie theaters now for the most part. They say that too much of a good thing can damage a final product, and this is evidence of how true that is."
" good but over long...
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,4,"...and if I had known I was going to watch an animated movie I might have enjoyed it more.This was at least a half hour longer than was needed. Personally I found the over use (and IMO over dependence) on CGJ made the parts were you could actually see the actors look strange...as if they had been cut into an animated movie.I enjoyed the film, but would have enjoyed it a lot more if it had been shorter."
" Entertaining Despite A Mediocre Script
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,7,"Part 3 of ""The Hobbit"" trilogy shows the fate of the dragon Smaug, Bilbo Baggins (played by Martin Freeman), dwarf king Thorin and his band of dwarf followers, the ""lonely mountain"" and the enormous treasure hidden within it, and the five armies that will do battle for the mountain fortress and its riches. But more things are unexplained. Perhaps in the extended cuts more will be revealed; but it's still inexcusable for a theatrical cut to omit so many answers to so many questions.Multiple story lines play out in rapid fire sequence — this movie has probably the shortest running time of all six ""Hobbit"" and ""LOTR"" movies — resulting in a very fast paced movie that sometimes feel a bit rushed. Of course, the usual shenanigans are here: characters that defy the laws of physics — or maybe physics are different in Middle Earth — and able to take a great amount of battle damage without being truly harmed. Hey, if a character is fairly invincible, it kind of takes away the element of suspense that he or she may be killed. Granted, a few of the characters get killed after killing millions of the enemy, but at this point it becomes a bit silly and the impact of those deaths are greeted with a shrug and another bite of the hotdog.Now, my most memorable movie moment of ""The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies"": the scene when Thorin (played by Richard Armitage, who looks a lot like Mel Gibson's Braveheart in his dwarf look) has an internal struggle, realizing what his greed has done to him and the choice he has to make if he doesn't want to follow the dreadful path his ancestors took.Although full of problems that would be deserving of a much lesser grade, ""The Five Armies"" was still an enjoyable, entertaining feast for my eyes. Although I wonder if my forgiving nature is the result of having watched this movie for free (thanks, Library!).Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" Just ignore the damn reviews.
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,10,An amazing end . I litrelly started crying at the end. If you are a tolkin fan you will love this series. I don't know why there is so much hate. Maybe thats because some fans cant see another movie or they just want to compare things. I think peter jackson did a great job . This guy is genius. I m not saying its better than LOTR(No movie/TV series can be better than LOTR including GoT). Just watch it . And don't compare it to LOTR . And thank you peter jackson for one more awesome trilogy.hope you will make sillmarions too.
" had to write something to get Richard Head's negative review off the top
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,9,"I am of the opinion that if Peter Jackson and a quarter billion dollars couldn't satisfy a viewer, you are probably insatiable. Rather like complaining about living in the best country on the planet, during the greatest age of mankind, and doing nothing to improve it. Guess what? asking for the insurmountable and vindicating your self fulfilling prophecies went out with the millennium. The one where they had to start counting digits. This movie made contrived source material and undeveloped technology as close to modern mythology as one can. Fairy tales are not famed for character development. The nature of fine story telling is working with what you have at hand to pay for your dinner, and being asked back instead of driven out."
" Ravishing and yet frustrating
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,7,"Version I saw: UK cinema release (HFR 3D IMAX)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10I was a defender of Peter Jackson as the Hobbit films released to disappointed audiences, but it now seems clear that he didn't know what he was doing with the story. The Dol Guldur/Necromancer plot line really was tacked on for no good reason, adding almost nothing except opportunities to foreshadow the events of Lord of the Rings. The over-abundance of characters is a nightmare to manage, and yet they still get corralled into one place at the climax for the battle of the title. Smaug gets killed off before the opening credits. It's all a bit messy.And yet, the film remains very enjoyable, and I think, very good. The absolute orgy of scenery porn photographed by Andy Serkis' second unit combines with the master craftsmanship of Weta Workshop in both CGI and physical props/costumes/set dressing to make a sumptuous feast for the eyes. I honestly believe that if a viewer spent the whole movie focusing exclusively on the backgrounds, they would come away satisfied.And the acting is not bad either. Admittedly, none of it (and nothing else in the movie either) has a shred of subtlety, but the cast do a good job of portraying those big, blunt emotional arcs. Thorin's (Richard Armitage) operatic descent into madness and then redemption, Bilbo's (Martin Freeman) fear, suspicion and ultimate bravery, Tauriel's (Evangeline Lilly) pointless romantic sub-plot, all are implemented with gusto, and come across about as well as you could reasonably hope.As a die-hard Tolkien fan, I am happy to spend as long as I can in this Middle-Earth that Jackson has created. If the films had been 9 hours each, I would be fine with that. With more rigour at the screen writing stage, all three films could have been considerably better, but I am very happy with what we have."
" Hey, gang. Let's make a movie and see how much money we can make.
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,4,"Let's have some great fight scenes and string them together with the old familiar actors, and see if we can fool everyone into thinking its a good movie.What do you mean ""stay true to the story?"" We have to stretch one novel onto three really long movies. We've got all these great sets and great costumes and props and what not. We gotta use 'em. We'll tell them it's good, they gotta believe us.We'll reuse all of the old special effects. If they worked before they should work again. These fans will buy anything. They are so easy to fool.When we are done, what movie do you want to make next?"
" Far far far far worse than I'd feared
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,1,"The LOTR Trilogy was spectacular but somehow I'd missed the Hobbit so I decided to binge watch all three movies over the course of 3 nights. Having read the book a number of times in my youth I was somewhat surprised that they had made a 9 hour trilogy of this work and I set my hopes fairly low that this series would deliver. An Unexpected Journey came nowhere near my low expectation and I considered not watching The Desolation of Smaug but I did and I wasn't surprised that,if anything this film was worse than the first. My masochism must have kicked in at this point as I forced myself to watch the third and final instalment - The Battle of the Five Armies that set a new standard in awful. What the hell was this slash fest all about? I had to wind back the sequence when Thorin dies three times before I could make any sense of it I still failed. He's stabbed in an area of his chest as close to his heart as you could get yet still manages to kill his adversary and then gets up to have a walk round with no sign of a wound!! he then collapses and dies.# What was all that about? Dreadful series of films. I'm annoyed with myself that i wasted 9 hours of my life watching it."
" It was the best fantasy movie.
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie starts from the ending of the second movie. The elves and the lake town people decide to have a war. The dwarfs were outnumbered, so they take support of Thorin's cousin from the Iron mountain. Wow!!! This is the best movie in 'The Hobbit' trilogy. It was the best fantasy movie. Overall nobody should miss this amazing movie."
" Disgustingly Bad!!!!
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,1,"Oh my God,what happened? The first two Hobbit movies were just about watchable but this one takes a nosedive into a sheer and utter stupidity. Everything about this movie is just crap..crap..crap. Trying to catch lightning in a bottle one more time,Jackson instead destroyed the legacy of Tolkien and LOTR,not to mention his reputation as a filmmaker. All aspects of this turkey are horrible..the script,the acting with a very few exceptions,the CGI,the score,the whole shebang. This is about as lazy and uninspired as movie-making gets and it is absolutely incomprehensible that we are seeing the work of the same people who were doing wonders with LOTR. This is the worst example of money- grabbing and cynical Hollywood filmmaking out for a payday.Jackson is now the other member of the George Lucas Club,filmmakers whose reputation is forever lost."
" A Rather Middling Ending To Middle Earth On The Big Screen
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,5,"As a fan of all things Middle Earth, I was pumped up to see the conclusion of the film forays into Tolkien's universe. I absolutely loved the LOTR trilogy, as well as the first two Hobbit installments. Though I did not like the decision to split the small-ish book into three long films, a selfish part of me was kind of glad that I would have three more opportunities to see this franchise in theaters. Unfortunately, ""Battle of the Five Armies"" ran out of really good material to cover, and it showed.In this film, we see the dragon Smaug descending upon Lake-town in a fury, having discovered that his hoard of gold has been infiltrated by Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman). Bard (Luke Evans), the protector of Lake-town, discovers the ""chink in Smaug's armor"" and puts an end to the dragon's reign. With a pile of treasure now ripe for the taking, the Battle of the Five Armies begins, primarily egged on by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), who has a sort of ""dragon treasure fever"" take hold of him.The main problem with this movie is that Tolkien's ""Battle of the Five Armies"" isn't enough to make an entire movie out of. Going by the text itself, I believe it only constitutes about 50 or so pages! It seems as if director Peter Jackson got a little battle-happy, as posturing for battles and the battles themselves constitute a great portion of the film. Perhaps, however, that was almost required because of the trilogy of films (what else could you have the characters do?).I think what really got exposed here is that ""The Hobbit"" isn't (and never was meant to be) a story about battles. The LOTR book trilogy is an epic, to be sure, but ""Hobbit"" is much more of a children's tale, full of fun and frivolity. It has its serious, canon moments to be sure, but it is a very simple tale compared to LOTR. The first two Hobbit films actually do a really good job of re- creating that levity while still maintain an LOTR-esque sense of gravitas. In ""Five Armies"", though, the subject material left over is all about posturing, speeches, and battles. What was meant (and rightly so) as a somewhat speedy (yet logical) completion of the book cannot sustain a two and a half hour film.There are subplots involving Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Tauriel (Evangeline Lily), and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), but I found that material to be quite lackluster as well. It tries to set up the events of ""Fellowship of the Ring"" in a prequel-esque sort of way, but I never really felt that sense of ""oh, that's cool!"" at all. Again, probably because such scenes are not in the Hobbit novel and thus don't feel quite right.All that being said, this isn't a terrible movie. Jackson still has his directing touch, the battles are visually impressive, and the music/atmosphere is always so distinctly Middle Earth that one cannot help but be transported into that universe, if you will. Howard Shore's incredible music helps too.Overall, though, after about 20 minutes into the film when Smaug breathes his last, it becomes unnecessarily (though necessary to sustain an entire third part) bloated and overplayed. It's too bad that one of the greatest book-to-film translations of all-time has to go out on just an ""okay"" note."
" Get on with it
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,6,"The one overriding feeling I have whilst watching this movie is ""Get on with it!"" The dragon is killed in the first ten minutes. And then you're left wondering what's next? Lots of talking and the odd skirmish. Galadriel's scenes are excellent. But once she leaves you're left wondering what's next? You begin to stare at your watch. At 50mins in you realise there's almost two hours to go. Cue more talking. Discussions that are unnecessary. Scenes that could be omitted. It could've been fast paced. It could've raced and heightened the drama. The story is there but it's given too much space to breathe."
" Review from someone who didn't read the book
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"An Unexpected Journey was decent but during the Desolation of Smaug, I could notice a sharp decline in quality and things began to really drag out. The Battle of Five Armies continues that trend. The CGI that is used in the battle scenes are absolutely terrible, which I'm sure you noticed in the first two films. However, there is a battle scene that is absurdly long. There is no sense of danger whatsoever. It's almost like they are fighting on the moon, weightless. The orcs pose no threat at all! And that Azog character, what a joke! Not only does he look like a cartoon character, his role is so stupid! There's also so many new devices that the orcs use in battle that we don't see in the LOTR Trilogy... they really catered to the kids in this trilogy.The only good thing about this trilogy is that it pretty much forces you to go and watch the LOTR Trilogy again just to make up for this."
" So very very annoying
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,3,"So, not only did Jackson somehow find the way to dilute what basically amounts to 30-40 pages at most in the original book into a 2.5-hour film filled with confused fights, ninja-elves and inconsistent acting: in the end, after more than 8 hours of trilogy, he realized he needed to actually have an ending, so he cooked up a quick one and left a troll-load of unanswered questions behind. Who will rule the dwarven city now that the king is dead? What will happen to the fine folks of Laketown? Who exactly beat the orc army near the town when the king was elsewhere fighting Azog? What happened to that oily character Alfrid - did he manage to escape? On what terms did dwarfs, men and elves leave each other? Beorn came to the rescue with the eagles, kicked some serious orc butt and then.... what? Plus a dozen more subplots left dangling.If the first movie had left me disappointed and the second one had left me bored, this third and final piece of the puzzle left me just deeply annoyed. A complete waste of resources and beautiful source material. Whatever goodwill Peter Jackson had rightfully gained with the first wonderful trilogy is now forever squandered. And please, let us never see another installment of Legolas again: the elves are immortal, but Orlando Bloom is not, and no CGI in the world can remove the years his face has accumulated."
