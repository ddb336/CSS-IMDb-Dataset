" A dreadful, dismal, depressing movie - a definite miss.
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,2,"This film is a miserable trip down an inexplicable rabbit hole with no explanations or resolutions and thus constitutes a distressing waste of talent and resources. The story is full of holes, featuring a near saintly-dispositioned hero with the patience of Job - but without any rewards for his suffering; how, exactly, his beautiful, smart, stuttering daughter transforms from adoring and adored darling to a spoiled and disrespectful brat who morphs into a terrorist who is then in turn terrorised into a state of trauma from which there is no return, makes no sense within the story presented to the audience suckered into it by beautiful photography, cast and an upbeat beginning. How this film was greenlit by any studio anywhere, remains a mystery. Furthermore, it's a liability to put entertainment out there like this: I wish I'd spent my precious 1.5 hours leisure time watching something more interesting and uplifting. If I'd watched it in a cinema, you can be certain I'd demand my money back!"
" Outstanding
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,"I remember that time period and it totally rings true, not only a generation of youth that were spoiled , who had so much and also where many were killed or destroyed mentally by the insane Vietnam war The war between parents and their children that harmed so many families and the love and anguish."
" I love anything with Jennifer Connelly in it!
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,8,"I'm simply one of her biggest fans since the beginning of her career when she played the daughter of a wealthy man from small town America who plays with the bad kid from the other side of the tracks, all to get back at her father. So, this movie is rather ironic as the story of a well to do family from eastern suburbia. With parents who doted their daughter with everything she could ever want. But, who stutters apparently because of being ashamed of who she was. A story about the dilemma of well-meaning parents who don't know what to do with a troubled child. A child who grows up in the turbulent 1960s who thinks she change force the change that is needed with violent protest. It's amazing that the very same messed up society then is still very much in existence today. The only thing that has changed in the 60 years is that the government has learned how to suppress descent. In ways that avoid the violent anti-white picket fence Americana that still exists.A protest movie, a family angst play, parental grief and offspring despair. This is a rather good story of middle class life in the 1960s."
" Family scapegoating by narcissist beauty Queen mom devastated empathetic dad
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,10,"Yes I would like to have seen the mother daughter relationship explored. The mom perhaps covertly toxic, cold, aloof, passive aggressive and an ice Queen family fracturing, parental alienation soul destroying toxic feminine. mom was a beauty Queen , a covert charming narcissist ,!who married rich , but was bored. Her sadistic pleasure was to destroy kind hearted, hard working, empathetic husband,destroying fathers relationships , isolated him, even with his child the family scapegoat and The identified patient - also called the ""symptom-bearer"" or ""presenting problem"" - may display unexplainable emotional or physical symptoms, and is often the first person to seek help, perhaps at the request of the family. The tragedy the damage caused by narcissistic mom and incongruent incompatible marriage. and sad how much the dad loved his daughter. Sometimes incompatible marriage and narcissistic moms that have children create horrific relationships abuse and pathology ðŸ’”"
" Dakota fanning sucks.
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,1,"Dakota fanning sucks.1:48 and good actors wasted on a movie that could be titled ""Dakota Fanning sucks"". Good talent terrible script that just makes you feel bad at the end. Absolutely garbage."
" One of the Saddest, Most Tragic movies I think I've ever seen
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,9,"By the end, I was sobbing. How did they get there? What happens to tear an entire family apart at the seams? So many regrets. I felt Swede's pain. His love was a father's unconditional love for a daughter. And he never gave up on her."
" How to discredit the strives of whole era
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,1,"I've never read the book and I never will.The acting was quite bad, and one should be quite under the veil of the ideological and institutional brainwashing that this movie represents not to see it right away. I'm sure most of the people here who watch it as a confession of a ""sick times"", the ""end of idealism"" and so forth, felt quite sorry for the situation the father left with, for his whole struggle to get his daughter ""back"", whatever that means, and all that crap.From the very beginning, we get acquainted with the girl's daddy issue. Little by little, we enter the confusing world for which her therapist prepared us, reciting the reason for her stuttering in the first few minutes. The whole construction of her image is based on the belief that radical politics and the (in that case way too radical) actions it sometimes implies presuppose some confusion, some deviation from the normalcy, some alienation from everyday life.On the contrary, it is based on the dismantling of the confusion, on undressing of normality and revealing it as what it is, on being present within the lived life, its conditions and the unacceptable limitations that it imposes on human potential.I don't know how someone will put this into the ""Most Popular Leftist Radical Movies and TV Shows"" list. This movie belongs in the ""Most Popular Reactionist Movies and TV Shows"". It's a textbook on how to discredit the hopes and dreams for a better world here and now of a whole generation, a whole era."
" A decent drama
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,6,"It has a simple plot but it turns out to be deep, and it has good actors."
" Critics in blinkers
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,10,"I don't know whether to laugh or cry at some of the negative criticism this movie has received from certain serious mainstream critics. Ewan McGregor is a Scott therefore he shouldn't have had anything to to do with Roth's Jewish stuff. And the BBC should never have done a zillion iterations of Anna Karenina because they're not Russians. And Kurosawa should never have done Ran cos he made King Lear feel Japanese. And Marion Cotillard should not have played Lady Macbeth, French accent and all...Just what a blinkered literal cinematic, artistic and cultural universe do such critical authorities inhabit?
The muscle of Roth's prose, just like that of Capote, Hemingway and so much else of 20th century American lit cannot, perhaps, be totally accurately represented in the medium of film. But the sense, the spirit, the themes of any lit can be adapted to film with a great deal of success. And that's what this film is, an adaptation. And a pretty good one at that. The ethnicity of the participants is just so much irrelevant critical obfuscation. I was actually surprised how close to the spirit and the atmosphere of the book this adaptation was, in particular the depiction of gender themes and the ambiguity of the central father-daughter relationship, with themes of Jewishness being peripheral, just like they are peripheral in Roth's work. He used to get mad at being designated a Jewish writer, he saw himself as an American one, and the title IS American Pastoral. And both the central and secondary themes are placed smack in the middle of post-WWII America...no need to enumerate them, they're pretty obvious to anyone who either reads the book or watches the movie with some attention. I find Connolly and Fanning incredibly irritating most of the time, but here they do a good enough job of the alienation they feel from each other and, in the case of Fanning's character, alienation from everything and everyone. It was the 60s, people, remember? I for one am glad McGregor had the guts to give it a go, both as director and actor. His rendering of the Swede is pretty authentic of the book character. A difficult multilayered novel adapted to another medium with its soul and integrity intact. Perhaps the critics wanted an ethnic bias cos that would be much easier to praise. More in line with today's cheap identity politics. Or a misogynistic reading, an accusation levelled at Roth repeatedly. Except that both in the book and the film, the Swede takes full responsibility for his daughter's failings, blaming his own vision and the way he raised her. Which is possibly the thematic pivot in the novel. You'd have to be a blind identarian to see misogyny in that. Respect to Mr McGregor for resisting cheapening Roth's book in such ways. A difficult, complex often depressing and ambiguous film. Exactly like the book. Critics caught paying more attention to their preconceptions than the alleged object of their criticism."
" Institutional Memory
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,7,"Fifty years after the sixties America is beginning to wonder whether the unrest and social confusion that were the 60ies were born of the gilded straitjacket and tunnel-vision that were the 50ies and a utopia that was never real. This movie is an allegory of the narrative of that question.Zuckerman, the narrator, discovers all these decades later that nothing was what it seemed and tells us the story of the Swede, the High School star athlete who represents the 50ies, his beauty queen wife who represents America and their daughter who represents a paradise that was not so much ""lost"" as one that never really was. Their daughter stutters, suffocated by her parents' ""50ies"", but as a young girl she does not stutter when she sings, as a young adult she does not stutter when she wears a vail over her mouth and she is both in love and repulsed by her father, eventually giving up on him and becoming free of him as she had earlier cut free from her mother.It's all allegorical, maybe metaphorical, and it could probably have been done better, but the movie and the actors do their very best to tell us a story that is not far from true."
" Guess what? Life is disappointing
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,4,"""Swede"" Levov is a rich Jewish sport hero who marries Dawn, a beauty queen. Apart from biographical reasons, the Jewishness is an irrelevant side note (one of many) in this narrative.Some 40 years after the happy marriage, writer Zuckerman goes to a high school reunion and is brought back to memory lane by photos of his acquaintance, the Swede. Zuckerman thinks about the perfect life the Swede must have had, only to have his thoughts destroyed by the impact with reality, narrated by the Swede's brother, also present to the reunion.Turns out that Dawn and Swede offspring was a creepy, stuttering child, nicknamed Merry, who grew up in the 60s and became a terrorist, in protest against ... well, everything.Dakota Fanning as Merry is incredibly annoying and her stuttering distracting. The plot starts as a tragic tale of social upheavals and turns into a weird, flaccid search for a missing daughter who went bonkers on the field. The whole political and social part, introduced at length, is dropped suddenly when Dawn starts to go bonkers herself.Lots of scenes are cringeworthy disconnected, like the long riot scene around the Swede factory, and the attempted seduction of the Swede by yet another bonkers female character.Long, disjointed, disappointing movie whose only point seems to prove that even those who start as winners may end up disillusioned and disappointed by life... not exactly ground breaking news."
" AMERICAN SNOOZEFEST
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,5,A seemingly pointless and drawn out story about a broken family. No reasons or rationale. Just a slow train to nowhere.Watch if you must
" Very Disappointing
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,2,"With such a great cast and interesting subject matter this movie showed great potential but it gradually deteriorated into gratuitous rubbish.
Stopped watching it once it started sinking into the mire."
" Full of angst
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,2,"Full of angst, portent and gravitas.Well, certainly full of angst.The book was probably better but if it was, it didn't translate particularly well to the screen.Lots of good story points and concise scenes in the beginning but it later started to drag and many things weren't explained, not that it particularly marred the movie - you're just glad it was over.I haven't read the book so can't say if it was well adapted. Some books just don't translate well to the screen. This may have been one."
" Hard to Watch at Times..but For the Right Reasons
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,8,I found this film to be quite compelling with solid performances all the way through. It was hard for me to watch the tearful moments we see between Father and Daughter... To see the hurt in a parent's eyes when they realize how far their child has fallen. Being close to my family- this film had me in tears and I can honestly recommmend it strongly but be prepared for some disturbing material that really took me awhile to shake.
" Outstanding view of our parents at that time.
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,9,"I was born in '69 to hippies, educated for free by the state of California. They taught the following generations and earned a place in the middle-class.But the American Dream is a fantasy in reality for most Americans when you look at our demographic data. And this film takes place just after the Dream was defined as 'a successful career'.But in reality, reality is very persuasive and for most, overwhelming. What if, instead of McNamara, you or your child witnessed the man who self-immolated? And what would your childhood be like when the facade of the American Dream is shown on TV every night by Cronkite? What would you have done? Accept being a redneck or leave for the city/university to influence positive change? It's one thing to be taught our Constitution and it's a completely different thing to learn our history and our reality.The film perfectly navigates racial and economic revolutions through the lens of a family. The actors are fantastic. The whole film feels real. Some of the characters could have been my relatives. And the role of daughter is so well thought out and supported with dialogue that the film can amaze.The characters are full and the plot is as well. This film has a place on our history shelf's. It can be impactful if you let it. I am thankful for this work."
" Maybe book adaptations are the only hope for an experimental cinema
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,10,"My immediate reaction was, that was bad and then I said wait a minute, that was good. It explores the 70s via surrounding generations and how mysticism through hippiedom was the inevitable psychological escalation to the political insanity abound. Especially this was all pre-irony, before irony answered inevitably, meaning this strange detour into occultism was a kind of societal escape valve. The film even had the psychologist lecturing how the daughter is unlike the mother, aka, the 70s would reveal the 50s. Jennifer Connoly seemed quite vicious and eager to abandon her, choosing selfish expression and free love. McGregor, the father left an the odd man out not heeding his gloomy father's shadow. This was the wrong daughter for these people. Their punishment was her humanity. The conscience as both a weakness and a burden. It can not go unexpressed as with self-immolation. She states the cloak hides her from the disease of speech, since it was so often used to distort morality. The stutter, and mouth, the kissing, the friend with the taste; it was all oral. You got the emergence of pop psychology then, red pills and insights how words can hypnotize the masses. The bombings and such... the story is completely and utterly preposterous. And the film's tone for its absurdity is odd being oscar bait. McGregor, having come up with Danny Boyle I hoped for more 'vision'. As the other review said it's almost a great film; that is because novel adaptations are a refuge for what is a dying breed, an excuse for, and a means for the smuggling of a kind of abstract or conceptual cinema; so even seeing a bulletpoint treatise on a great novel, I see a chunk of experimental cinema, it can't not be good."
" Why do I watch these movies?
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,7,"Don't get me wrong this is a great effort and I give kudos to Ewan MacGregor for his first foray into directing. He tells a tale, although flawed, and it's a good tale that could've been told in many ways. He did it his way for better or worse and it landed in the middle.
It's one of the saddest stories I've ever seen on film. I did not read the Philip Roth novel but I intend toThe ending gave something up in the guise of bittersweetness but it wasn't really bittersweet, it was just cery sad. One of the saddest movies ever made."
" A dull and tame adaptation
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,3,"Based on late author Philip Roth's 1997 Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name, American Pastoral see's the seemingly never ceasing to work Ewan McGregor step behind the camera for the first time to adapt Roth's supposedly unadaptable book for the big screen.Only recently finding its way to the Australian marketplace after premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival way back in September of 2016, Pastoral see's McGregor trying valiantly to bring Roth's revered work to life for the big screen treatment but it's to little avail as McGregor's well-intentioned work behind and in front of the camera as lead character Swede Levov amount to little in an adaptation that loses sight of what made Roth's work a member Time magazine's list of 100 best novels.Famous for its dealings around the social and political unrests of the 1960's and 1970's American landscape, Roth's family drama centring around Swede and Jennifer Connelly's wife Dawn idealistic world being shattered by their stuttering daughter Merry (played well by Dakota Fanning) being implicated in a violent act of political terrorism, Pastoral's finer nuances and themes have been lost by Mcgregor and screenwriter John Romano as this unbalanced feature becomes more of a tale of a father looking for his missing daughter.Many naysayers to a cinematic adaptation of Roth's work felt for year's that the novels layered and complicated foundation would struggle to be brought to life on the big screen and there's little doubt as to why so many various behind the scenes players and actors have come and gone on this project before McGregor decided to take matters into his own hands.While the film itself is a notable failure and fans of Roth's work are likely to be left cold by this experience, there are brief glimpses on show here that would suggest McGregor should try his hand once more at the directing game, with the period detail and atmosphere created by the well-liked actor a highlight of the film that otherwise leaves much to be desired, especially in its cinematic treatment of much of Roth's dialogue that comes across here as both stale and stilted rather than full of life.Final Say - Some books are unfortunately better left untouched for the big screen treatment, with American Pastoral one of these. Despite good intentions from all involved, including a trying very hard McGregor, this is an adaptation you're best off avoiding.1 Â½ high school reunions out of 5"
" Bad !
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,1,Very depressing movie !!! Didnt really see the meaning
" Thunderously Unconvincing, Riotously Miscast
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,2,"There's not one authentic moment in this entire film. Nobody captures the richness of Jewish speech, humor, or warmth. The Sixties are never convincingly brought to life, and the characters are all misrepresented. In Roth's novel the Swede is strong, handsome, athletic and charismatic -- more John Wayne than Woody Allen. He's a man of stature. In the movie he's a doormat (what we used to call a schlemiel) and everyone walks all over him. In the book daughter Merry is an ugly duckling and even her own father finds her repulsive. In the movie she's played by Dakota Fanning, a genuinely arresting screen presence who looks smart and chic even when she's lounging around in cast-off military jackets. Neither the book nor the movie creates characters you can like or care about, but at least in the book there's a certain amount of barbed humor and acid social commentary. The movie is never funny, except when it's trying to be tragic and profound. Watch the scene where the Swede ""apologizes"" to the family of the man killed in his crackpot daughter's bomb blast. Watch the way McGregor just sits there staring at the widow and her little boy. Watch the way the little boy just sits there, staring at the man whose daughter just killed his daddy. Watch the kid's eyes. They are blank, totally blank, and the scene goes on for about five minutes. Nothing happens, just a little boy sits there and looks empty-eyed. For five minutes. While Swede hems and haws and says nothing much at all. It's painfully clear that this director never directed a film before, but the irony is that there was material here for a real classic. The themes and underlying atmosphere of American Pastoral are not so different from Legends of the Fall. A well-meaning patriarch tries to shelter his child from the evil of the world, only to find his world destroyed by the choices his child makes. The problem is that a putz like Swede Levov just doesn't hold the audience's attention. And his wife looks stupid walking around with a cow!"
" Worth the time to watch....
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,8,"Brilliantly filmed and acting superb American Pastoral shows how lives can be turned upside down even for those whose beginnings are so charmed and envied. It's a sad movie but not false in the story of family, parental love and how, given the circumstances, that love can't save or fix what shatters their existence. Yes, we don't truly know what motivates Merry. But, in real life there are times, we never have the answers.
Ewan McGregor captures this brilliantly."
" Stereotypical white privilege
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,7,"The story is fairly stereotypical. Elements include a rebellious teenager , an overworking father, and mentally unbalanced mother, who was a beauty queen in college! The acting is very good, but the story is contrived."
" Stiffly acted and written garbage
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,1,"The daughter looks to be about age 7 in 1963 when she sees the Buddhist monk burning on TV. At most 5 years pass when she is watching Lyndon Johnson on TV
and she looks like she's aged 30 years. (She could only have aged 15 years since Dakota Fanning playing her was 22.) And an old and ugly 30 years at that. Such carelessness shows in the rest of this horribly written and acted excuse for a film."
" ambition exceeds execution
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,5,"At a New Jersey school reunion, Nathan Zuckerman (David Strathairn) recalls class football hero Swede Levov (Ewan McGregor) but Jerry tells the writer Zuckerman the full story. Nathan is jewish and marries beautiful catholic Dawn Dwyer (Jennifer Connelly) despite his father (Peter Riegert)'s religious objections. He manages his father's glove factory and moves out into the country. They live a decent life and they send their stuttering daughter Merry (Hannah Nordberg) to psychiatrist Sheila Smith (Molly Parker). A teenage Merry (Dakota Fanning) turns radical over the Vietnam war.This is Ewan McGregor's directorial debut. It's probably too ambitious. His lack of experience leaves the movie missing a direction and intensity. It's an epic that is beyond his capabilities. First, I would abandon the wrap-around present day story. The stuttering is problematic. I'm sure that it's part of the novel but it stalls the conversational flow. Aside from the stuttering, some of the dialogue is clunky. This wants so badly to be shocking and emotionally sprawling. It would help to give Dawn more screen time especially after Merry's departure. The hotel scene with Rita is almost comical and Dawn should be there. Dawn's deterioration is too abrupt because the movie doesn't follow her down. Nathan is stuck in a frustrating way. By falling short, this fails through setting the bar too high."
" Devastatingly honest telling of a story familiar to more than a few
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,9,"Ewan McGregor directs himself in ""American Pastoral"", in which he stars alongside Jennifer Connelly as his wife, and Dakota Fanning as daughter Merry. It's at times stagey, melodramatic and with occasional lapses of dialogue in a cumbersome direction, but it treads courageously where very few films have ever trod before, and that's got to be what film is for ... what Philip Roth's original book was for. The world needs to know, these subjects cannot just be ignored.You think you're normal parents in a normal family, doing your best to raise a kid, but somehow at some late-childhood/early-teenage moment - as McGregor's character Swede Levov notes - something just grows inside them, and they rebel, kick away all the traces. Perhaps the first sign is some slightly inappropriate behaviour, as when a still-young Merry asks her father to ""kiss her properly"" (film parts company from book here - comments here naturally apply to the movie). Or maybe an excessive reaction to something on TV?At first, those around you tell you to step back and allow space, and it will be OK. Just maybe they are right, as long as the kid doesn't go too far off the rails (in the case of this story, Merry does go off into areas beyond redemption or recovery). But anyway, sooner or later, neighbours and family and medicos and authority figures may be more than a little inclined to blame you for your incorrect upbringing of the child, even though it's nothing you've obviously done. Equally, there may be some who suffer at the child's hands, but end up pitying you, rather than condemning, and it's then hard to know which is worse - as in an electric scene played out here between Merry's parents and the wife and kid of her first, entirely innocent, victim.You don't give them that space, they rebel; you do allow them to do their own thing and ... guess what? They still rebel.The asymmetry is the most shocking thing. They hate you, and you love them back. They run off and do who knows what, and you still sit there and worry yourself witless. They urge you to give up on them, and you just can't. These truths in the film are writ large, as are the ultimate parental responses. Merry's mother hits a crisis, and feels a change of image - up to and including infidelity - is the way out. She also regrets marrying Swede. And guess what? She survives. Father can't abandon causes, so he pines and withers away, and dies before his time - (apparently) a (lost) hero of parenting, just as he had been a hero on the school sports-field and in the US Marines, and even a hero for employing black workers in his New Jersey glove factory, as had his father before him (a nice part for Peter Riegert, by the way).How real is all that? For some out here agonisingly real - people who want their story to be told, their heartache known, want the world not just to go on and take no notice at all.Presumably rather few will watch, as ""American Pastoral"" is hard to deal with. It throws in a second message about the ""American dream"" turning sour. And that is clearly an oversimplification, as the film itself acknowledges, since the War was the war (hardly a picnic), while the 50s were only innocent and a time of plenty where the Klan and others were not doing evil things, and where the White Anglos (and here also Jewish people) were able to get on with and in their lives, without having to come before House Committees. But the 60s and 70s hardly brought anything better with them, with 'Nam giving people a chance to hate a disillusioned hate that they were as willing to turn on their families as they were on national authority and Uncle Sam. Dirty and sad responses to a dirty and sad government business, and two parents caught in the crossfire and having their lives ruined without doing much to deserve it.Overwhelmingly, we are challenged to find a period - however short - in which the American dream really did exist, and the answer is compellingly clear...Would Merry have gone of the rails even had there been no Vietnam? Would she have grown less hateful at least? These are questions the film has no chance to pose, given that that War and all the associated ""Reds under the Beds"" stuff did happen, and there's no going back on that.And there is no going back for Merry either, and a father's love just cannot get around that.""American Pastoral"" also tells a story about a campaign of bombing terrorism at home in America that history seems to have done a very efficient job of sweeping under the carpet. The truth of this is made clear by a ""Time"" article of September 2016 entitled ""The Bombings of America that we Forgot"" - well worth reading as background to a watch of this film which, maybe you don't want to, but maybe you should...There are a couple of quite strongly erotic moments, and several things that are disturbing in a psychological sense, leaving this film firmly in the realm of the challenging. Ultimately, ""American Pastoral"" should perhaps have stayed as a book, given that even the acting and staging in the movie version are a little imperfect. But had there been no film, I would doubtless never have encountered the story - and that would have been a great, great shame. So thank you, Ewan McCregor and co., for having the dignity and courage and determination and imagination to bring this to the screen."
" About a father who never gave up on his daughter!
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,6,"The book was from the 90s and the story is about the 60s. Narrated from the father's perspective, that's what I think did not work in this film. This is where a film and the book does not synch. Because books are always very detail when it describes a person. In the films, they are just a simple visual where viewers have to focus on those details to have a perfect impression like the book. So I totally point out to the writer who did not quite transformed the point of the storytelling.It is not the parents to decide what their kids want to be. The film opened with a couple ready to get married, arguing with their elders about something. Soon it forwards to a few years where their relationship with their daughter seems not good. Further, they become more distant and completely lose her for the unrest in the society and the nation. But father never gives up. His love and care for her leads the way and what comes later is even more disturbing before it all ends.It was Ewan McGregor's directional debut. I don't think he would try it again, not any time soon. But I would appreciate his quality of filmmaking. He only needs a better writer and the screenplay. I also think, he should not direct himself. I never considered him a best actor. I yet to see his performance. The film was not strong enough, if you are from outside the United States. Because what they call this 60s revolution was more a misunderstood by the young people. Particularly that religious thing, they were misled and spoiled their lives. So, instead of focusing that, the film centred on a father-daughter relationship. That is why it was a decent film. Otherwise I would have rated even wrose.5.5/10"
" It gets a little scarce
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,4,"In every way the film tastes a little. If he did not have the actors he has, it could be a movie for television. It is too long and flat Ewan would be very busy with other things, I imagine, because his interpretation is tremendously flat. I do not think any parent who cares what worries this, this so quiet. Jennifer is not bad, but her role is minor.He has a photograph that is neither good nor bad. Does not stand out for anything.Directing the truth I did not like it. It is slow, repetitive, does not put you in the story, you should get a lot and also do not know to have the camera.If it were not for the actors that it is, I do not think anyone would see it"
" A bleak interpretation of the 60's peace movement
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,5,"First off, I have to admit that Ewan McGregor did a decent job for a first-time director, however, that doesn't excuse the flaws in its development and implementation. The first half of the story seems right on the nose, with its criticism of the perfect marriage of a beauty queen and football star, like a dramatic interpretation of the Married with Children TV series. It all seems to go downhill as the daughter, slowly becomes every conservative parent's worst nightmare. This character dynamic would have been a perfect opportunity to make a social/political statement about the core problem with the myth of the America dream, but instead it takes us down a darker road, where liberalism, under the guise of the daughter, is used as an equivalent to terrorism. Completely missing from this story, which takes place in the 60's around the anti-war movement, is any notion of the peaceful hippy or yippie protester. The overall theme of the second half of the film comes across as a story written by a CIA operative posing as a writer. I haven't read the book, so I can't tell if this is a misinterpretation by the film adaptation. Beyond the extreme right wing overtones of thematic elements, there are also many holes in the narrative, which require suspension of disbelief in large supply. Most of these disappointing elements could have been remedied by turning the antagonistic roles away from the daughter and mother, and onto the father, who didn't seem deserving of the sympathy awarded to the protagonist."
" Great acting performances, unrewarding story
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,6,"After watching about 30 minutes of this film, I wondered if I should plan on watching it again. Sometimes I have some difficulty with plot lines that have no clear direction. As I watched it to the end, I realized that once would be enough. Was it a historical piece? Was it another Ordinary People exercise? The daughter's problems were never adequately explained, even with a psychiatrist character with multiple scenes. It left me hanging, not understanding and with a very quiet ending..."
" Mad Men on Acid
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,5,"What a strange one this is. The movie strays pretty far from the book, and plays like the weirdest episode of Mad Men never filmed. The tone is unrelentingly dour, and the point is... what? Stuttering leads to radicalization? Don't have a mixed marriage? The 60s were a bitch? It's well done, and the filmmakers' hearts were in the right place but David Strathairn as the Philip Roth character and Ewan McGregor as a Jewish guy? Nope."
" Compelling, dramatic and sentimental
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,8,"I never was a fan of Philip Roth, but in this film his story has convinced meAnother good surprise is the direction of Ewan Mcgredor, supported for the whole films actors, maybe because he's himself an actor.A dissection of the American dream head over heels, begins in the innocents 50's and develops thru the 60's showing the breech produced in the 70's.This drama of a man that loves his daughter and never stop fight until his dead. It's compelling, dramatic and excessively sentimental and too long.I'm not a great fan of dramas but this piece it's extraordinary, I couldn't forget the feelings the film provoked while all the way home and long after supper.Extraordinary piece of drama."
" Are they all insane?
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,5,"They appear to be the ideal American family. That is so not the case. First of all why would any parent let a 16 year old go alone into New York City to meet ""friends"" that the parents have never met? Let alone in a time period of civil unrest, and second when they act the part of a bratty fool as the character Merry. Great job by all the actors and Ewan McGregor pulling double duty acting and directing. The story screws with your mind and in the end, ew. Good psychological thriller, not sure who I'd recommend it to though."
" Honest review
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,2,"Really! Talented people choose to be in this Show? I watched it all the way through because of the actors. I assumed at some point their would be a story worth watching. I would be wrong. And in the end, someone phoned in the ending because they didn't care either. I would like anyone from this movie to contact me and either explain why they did it or apologize to me personally."
" That wasn't the best movie ever, that's for sure.
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,5,"When I saw the cast I really thought this was going to be a good movie but in the end it just a disappointment. It deserves an average five star rating just because of the cast. Their acting is good, so nothing wrong with that, but the story is just not interesting enough to make it a good movie. I though the character played by Dakota Fanning was extremely annoying and therefor I lost interest in the story itself. She's playing a confused young brat that I would not give one second of my time. When she was younger and still stuttering it was okay to watch. I thought the story would go somewhere but when she grows up it's just about a father searching for his daughter. It's just too slow and too boring to be good. Well at least that's my opinion."
" Idle/ideal life
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,7,"This movie has strong characters in it. And I love the fact that Jennifer Connely plays a strong character. Or at least it seems that way (early on she has a great confrontation where she lets her acting muscles play), but unfortunately she has to take a back seat to Ewans character taking center stage later on. Him and Dakota Fannings relationship (also other actress playing his daughter) is elemental for this movie.A movie that is about growing up, about responsibilities and also about choices. And getting to the point of accepting certain things. There's a powerful scene late in the movie with Ewan and Jennifer and another parent that strikes more than a chord. And while these are the best moments, sometimes the movie does seem muddled, trying to hard to make a point/statement. Overall it does succeed though, which comes down to the actors in the main roles. Not an easy watch at all ..."
" About traps on way to be good father and husband
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,10,"I have seen in many ways better films. But this story has surprised me in shocking way. I feel like naked, because this could happen to me and before seeing this movie I did not know this. How unbelievably easy is to be blind and not to be aware of it in time. How difficult is to see thinks which are so different from what we are use to see."
" Clearly shows how anti-society through ignorance is a very dangerous ideology
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,9,"This movie is great at showing us how anti-society thinking is a dangerous ideology to take upon especially when done in an ignorant way. The character in the film is anti-war, police and societal structure but doesn't offer and scientific approach to combat the situation. They are behaving in a rebellious way and do not feel the need to help make a better society, even though the society offers her safety and health and the same for her potential dependents.Instead she takes on a new ideology and existence in where she strives to not have any influence on society, by sharing her ideas. She even takes a biological approach to this influence, not wanting to poison the environment with her breath and refuses to wash so as not to pollute the water.Knowledge is power and this movie clearly illustrates that, leading the ignorant achiever to complete self-destruction through their own determination.Great movie!"
" Impressed with McGregor's work!
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,10,"Had no idea McGregor is directing movies! Definitely, the subject of the movie isn't an easy one to direct, but I think he did a great job in portraying the atmosphere of those times... Was extremely surprised by the end of the movie... as i believed too that he was wrong hoping... Thumbs up! Id' like to see more works by McGregor!"
" Welcome to the dark side.. whatever that means..
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,7,"The reasons I decided to watch this.Ewan McGregor's debut as a director. - Jennifer Connelly.I gotta admit, I'm not familiar with Philip Roth or his work. At all. My understanding of his status in American literature of the 20th century is superficial at best. Having said that, I'm convinced (without ever having read the book) that the movie leaves a lot of stuff out from the book. That is why I can only rate this slightly above average. The actors are doing their job, but there's a lot missing here. Many questions unanswered. Many highly improbable outcomes in relation to the daughter and her upbringing, emotional state, actions etc. Starting with not overcoming her stutter, voluntarily or not. Most of the story defies logic in every way. That girl had everything growing up, but instead of wanting to create, she decided to destroy which to me is inconceivable. And no, that scene where the father rejects her in the car and the one where she witnesses a Tibetan set himself on fire on television aren't enough to fundamentally change her and turn happiness into bitterness at a young age. Just doesn't cut it. All in all a nice effort for a first feature. 6.6/10"
" 'I was never more wrong about anyone in my life.'
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,8,"'I was never more wrong about anyone in my life.'Philip Roth's superb book has passages of language that crystallizes our thinking, our memories, our association with life. In this cinematic transformation the words are placed in the utterances by Nathan Zuckerman, sort of an Everyman as he states in the opening of the film â€“ 'Let's remember the energy. America had won the war. The depression was over. Sacrifice was over. The upsurge of life was contagious. We celebrated a moment of collective inebriation that we would never know again. Nothing like it in all the years that followed from our childhood until tonight, the 45th reunion of our high school classÂ…30 or 40, a gathering of my old classmates would have been exactly the kind of thing I'd have kept my nose out of. But at 62, I found myself drawn to it as if in the crowd of half-remembered faces I'd be closer to the mystery at the heart of things, a magic trick that turned time past into time present'. John Romano adapted Roth's novel American PASTORAL for the screen. Ethan McGregor directs. We all reflect on a time that somehow, though placed in the 1960's resistance against the Vietnam War, is terrifyingly familiar with the mood of the nation at present, again at resistance rallies â€“ and that is the reason it works so well.Seymour 'Swede' Levov (Ewan McGregor) was from the Jewish community and is an All- American sports star in high school. He had everything an American idol can dream of - a the tall muscular young man and high school star athlete but he married a Catholic beauty queen named Dawn (Jennifer Connelly) against his father's (Peter Riegert) advice. Swede later became the successful manager of the glove factory his father had founded, which allowed him to live with his wife in a beautiful house in the New Jersey countryside. Well-mannered, always bright, smiling and positive, conservative but with a liberal edge, what bad could ever happen to him? The couple's stuttering daughter Merry (Hannah Nordberg then Dakota Fanning) is their pride and joy until she steps into the 1960s and becomes an antiwar activist, responsible for bombing a little station, killing the owner in what is a senseless and horrifying change in life direction. Merry leaves home and the rest of the film is a father's search for peace with his distraught wife and community while he ceaselessly searches for his renegade daughter. A difficult film to watch, just as the book was challenging to read. But somehow the mirror it holds up to society as we are currently living it makes the disturbing experience all the more poignant."
" This was good.
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,6,A great movie by Ewan McGregor starting Ewan McGregor. Ewan McGregor takes on on a very dramatic turn as he plays An All- American college star with as beauty queen wife raising an all American daughter who gets caught up in the revolution of the 60s.The daughter is played by Dakota fanning in the type of roles she gravitates towards even when she was underage. Jennifer Connelly does an outstanding Job as the shield wife. In fact McGreogor creates the type of film all actors want to be have a role in.It creates a vast spin of emotion as you start to go through what main character is going through as his life spirals downward out of control.Well done direction by Ewan McGregor.http://cinemagardens.com
" Very dark, very real, very tragic, very powerful story
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"I guess I liked this movie more than most, based on the ratings. I think it may have been a bit too real, too tragic, too literal for most. Very well written, of course, being based on such a classic novel. Really great performances. Mcgregor, Connelly, Riegert, Fanning, and the always great Strathairn. Great direction, gorgeous production, editing, and sound. This was a very tight production. It was completely believable, in it's Shakespearean level of tragedy. The story follows Seymour ""Swede"" Levov (Ewan McGregor), the pride of the Jewish-American community in Newark (which nicknamed him ""Swede"" because of his Nordic good looks). By the looks of it the Swede seemed to have it all! He was a star high school athlete (really, a hero and a legend in his hometown), he married the catholic Dawn (Jennifer Connelly), a beauty queen, he took over his father's thriving glove business), he had a house with a nice spread, he and his wife had a loving, beautiful daughter to care for. What could go wrong? Everything. At the 45th high school reunion of Swede's younger brother, Jerry retells Swede's story to an old classmate, Nathan Zuckerman (David Strathairn), a journalist who was overseas during the 1960s. He tells him how Swede's life became difficult after high school - and went downhill from there. Swede had to struggle to get his very traditional father (Peter Riegert) to accept the Catholicism of his wife, Dawn, he struggled to keep his business viable in the face of declining customer demand (and being at the epicenter of the 1967 Newark race riots), and he struggled mightily with his daughter, Merry, who dealt with a bad stutter, which clearly affected her confidence and self-esteem (besides the ""problem"" of having such a beautiful mother, as pointed out by Merry's psychologist, Sheila (Molly Parker). But Merry's problems (and her parents' problems with Merry) had just begun. As she grew up, Merry became disillusioned with the world which she saw on TV as seemingly coming apart. She strongly sympathized with the Civil Rights Movement (especially its more radical elements) and the Vietnam anti-war movement (especially its more radical elements as well). She went from spewing hatred at President Johnson's image on the family's TV set to regularly taking the train into New York to commiserate with like-minded radicals. She rudely rebelled against all authority figures (including her own loving parents) and started talking openly about the need for a revolution in the U.S. One day, a local post office exploded, killing one man, and Merry disappeared. Her anguished parents insisted that Merry couldn't have done such a thing unless she was brainwashed and forced by others. The first half of the film is exceptionally well done and captures the essence of why the second half feels like a total loss of everything Swede thought he had. It is refreshing to see the film explore the relationship between father and daughter. The Rita Cohen (Valorie Curry) character, was a bit bizarre, as a shrink. Swede's determination and unconditional love for his daughter was true to life, and it was quite depressing to see what those admirable qualities did to his previously promising life. As a director McGregor captures the era, the times, the setting, and the difficulties of raising a child. This is a very somber film. It could have been better. But, it made some good points. It made me very grateful that I decided not to have children. Most just assume peaches and cream. Not so this time around!"
" Some truly radical politics
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,7,American Pastoral a fine flashback look at the 60s and how the events of the day affected one upper middle class family. The father is Ewan MacGregor the star athlete who married teen beauty queen Jennifer Connelly and looked like they were heading for the golden future. They're from Newark and MacGregor now manages the family business which is a leather goods factory in Newark. But they move out to the suburbs of Morris County. First off it's a mixed marriage with Jewish MacGregory marrying a Shiksa in Connelly. They have one child a daughter Dakota Fanning who growing up in the 60s sees what's going on around her and gets into some truly radical politics. Her parents are traditional liberal Democrats.Something she does makes her a fugitive. The rest of the film is MacGregor and Connelly's agonized family traditions are blown apart. They want to understand their child and want her back. But that can never be. This film is adapted from a Philip Roth novel and Roth drew his characters well as this was an era he and I both grew up in.Besides the main characters I would single out Peter Riegert's performance as MacGregor's father and Valerie Curry who has embraced totally Weatherman style radicalism. Her scenes with MacGregor who is trying to find his fugitive daughter just crackle with intensity.A real portrait of an era in America we're still trying to understand.
" The movie is dark, very allegorical and deserves a bigger audience than it will get.
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,7,"""Why does everyone say she did it when she couldn't have done it? She's been tricked and abducted."" Seymour (McGregor) was an All-American sports star that was the most popular kid in college. He married a beauty queen and has the perfect life. They are ecstatic when their daughter Merry (Fanning) is born. Little by little Merry becomes more and more radical and passionate about the polarizing politics of the 60's. After the local post office is blown up and someone winds up dead Merry is the lone suspect. Now, Seymour puts his life on hold to find Merry and discover the truth. This is a very very good move, but it is not for everyone. The pacing is just in that awkward spot where if you are interested in the movie you will stick with it and enjoy the events. If you are on the fence the pacing will be just slow enough that many may bail on this. As for the movie itself, its very artsy and deep and important. This is a great character study and features the best acting of McGregor's career. The movie is dark, very allegorical and deserves a bigger audience than it will get. Overall, a very deep and thought provoking movie that will either be liked or shut off before its finished, depending on the person. I give this a high B."
" A Boring Tale of A Sick and Boring ""All-American"" Family
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,2,"I watched this after reading only 1 review (""Brutal biased rewrite...""); as a pacifist and anarchist very much into the whole 60s trip, I was curious to see what would be shown.Not even halfway in, I was disappointed and bored. The tale is more about what a family appearing to be ""white picket fence"" on the outside really looks like in actuality than it is any kind of statement about the war or activism in the 60s. Watching this repulsive ""all-American"" family invokes no compassion or even interest; the movie captures nothing much 60s-related and is so dull it makes one want to watch something (anything) else."
" American Pastoral (2016)
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,6,"I really like the Fanning sisters so I'll basically watch anything with them. I was also curious about this film because its the directional debut of Ewan McGregor. I went in blind not knowing what the film would bring but it seemed to have a strong cast, and for the little buzz it generated it remained something that I really wanted to check out. I think its a solid debut for McGregor as a filmmaker but can't escape being too dull at times.The film is based on a novel about a family with a daughter with a speech impediment. She witnesses a traumatic scene of the infamous monk setting himself on fire in television. After this childhood incident Merry (Fanning's character) becomes a radical opponent of war. She starts out vehemently opposing Lyndon Johnson and the war efforts but eventually becomes the culprit in a murder after a bomb goes off. Swede (Ewan McGregor) spends most of the film trying to find his estranged daughter and find out why she is the way she is.I think the film has strong performances as you would expect from the cast of this caliber. You immediately see the disenchantment of youth in Fanning's character and understand how radical she is in her anti-war stance. Her pained relationship with her mother is stated quite well, and the uncomfortably in it drives her mother mad. I had no problems with the character interactions, however the film cannot escape feeling dull and prolonged. You don't care enough to follow Swede as he tries to find his daughter, and when you finally find her, its just very underwhelming.Its hard to care for Fanning's character as she's unlikable from the get go. The film doesn't offer much else outside of a quest for a character you'd rather remain lost. The method of storytelling does not always prosper as it goes through periods of stalling and the payoff isn't really entertaining. It gets very lost in an antiwar shuffle and remains shallow despite trying to go deep. I'd say its exciting to see McGregor get behind the camera but his first adaptation does not have enough life.6/10"
" Too much bla bla!
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,6,"About an hour in to this movie, a question struck me. 'When will this end?' I know the book is long and 'deep'(I read it several years back) and I know that bringing it to the screen would mean either producing a 4 hour 'epic' or cutting a lot out. Well, a lot WAS cut out. And it's still too long.As a debut director, we can accept that Ewan McGregor is feeling his way here as he steps both in front of and behind the camera. His acting skills are not under scrutiny or doubt here as it's clear he gives this 100% of his undeniable talent. His direction, however, is on shaky ground. There is just too much (what they used to call) 'speechifying' in this movie. Some characters have no dialogue at all which does not have within it some intention to make some profound comment upon the way of the world or its imminent demise. Now, this may be because of trying to squeeze all the book contains into a 1 hour and 50 minute film. Or, more likely, it is misplaced intentions. Nobody is this intense all the time. And it wears pretty thin on the viewer after about 45 minutes. This is why I was asking, 'When will it end?' I'd like to add that the supporting cast did what they could to carry the film forward but, as other reviewers have posted here, this is Ewan McGregor's vehicle. It rests on him - both as an actor and as a director. And, for all his skill and experience as a very fine actor, it's the direction which lets this film down.I will finish by saying, this is far from being a bad movie. Not at all. The challenge to turn the book into a movie is an enormous one. And Mr. McGregor did it. Bravo! Because it is stylish, generally well-acted and has its merits. But, if Ewan McGregor ever steps behind the camera again, I hope he will make that his only task in a future production. So that he can dedicate his talent exclusively to that.6 stars."
" A radically ordinary story of American Dream's shadow side
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,9,"American Dream that has gone wrong. Picture perfect couple (Ewan McGregor, Jennifer Connelly) has a troubled child. At first the girl has a stuttering problem but growing up and reaching puberty, there is no denying that she wants to be nothing like them. And then it gets much worse...Don't worry, it's not a horror movie or thriller although the summary may hint at that. To put it really shortly, it's a family drama.Also starring Dakota Fanning (the daughter as adult), Molly Parker (as her psychotherapist), Uzo Aduba (Crazy Eyes from ""Orange Is the New Black""!), Valorie Curry, Peter Riegert, David Strathairn. There are a lot of good actors movie although McGregor's character is firmly in the center of it all.This is gonna be the kindest review of ""American Pastoral"" you will probably read. Critics seem to hate it and viewers will likely stay indifferent, or not praise it highly. But me â€“ I'm loving it! To really understand what Ewan McGregor's directorial debut* is all about, you must be interested in watching and deciphering it as a parable, or simple story which includes a hidden moral or spiritual lesson.On more superficial level, ""American Pastoral"" can be watched just as a family drama set in 1950-60's USA. This way, it's a functional if uneasy viewing which makes you fathom something bigger lurking somewhere around the corner but not quite appreciate it fully.On deeper level it's about how difficult it really is to be flexible to the world and life around us. It's very human to long for freedom and try to place everything in boxes at the same time.The deeper meaning here can unfold by relying on several different frameworks â€“ psychoanalytical, just intellectual or spiritual / symbolic. The viewer's personal approach will, of course, be highly dependent on one's general world view, be it esoteric or rational (all things are ultimately explainable by science and reason), or somewhere in between. I say ""American Pastoral"" is most enjoyable from spiritual viewpoint. Actions and the behaviour of the characters make the most sense and seems most understandable and human, if one concentrates on WHY we do things we do. If one only view causal relationships â€“ he/she did it because of the past event x or y â€“ the whole story loses a lot of its colours and shades.The real magic here is how Ewan McGregor, with the help of all his cast and crew, has managed to make the movie work on every level you choose to see it. One may not particularly enjoy approaching ""American Pastoral"" just rationally as many critics have done. But the movie still has a strong sure sense of style, both in visuals and storytelling. This also works on two levels. Some see the movie as comical and theatrical, and characters as caricatures. At the same time, all this can convey so much emotion and sharp little observations about everyday life and relationships, that one can't help but be delighted during at least some moments. Just like reading a good spiritual book. I liked all the actors and Ewan McGregor is my long-time favorite. But especially powerful are Dakota Fanning and Valorie Curry, both evil and innocent at the same time.It's not often that movie manages to talk to me so directly and arouse emotions so strong as ""American Pastoral"" did. This is one of my big favorites from 2016 so far. It may surprise that McGregor has such a sure hand as a first-time director of a complex movie. But he has always been versatile and has starred in similarly dark and complex movie already, 2003's forgotten little gem ""Young Adam"".What DOES surprise is the fact that McGregor was not the original director and the man behind all this. As a director, he stepped in at the last minute after Philip Noyce left the production!I have planned on reading the works of Philip Roth for over ten years or so. Still haven't done it somehow. After seeing ""Pastoral"", I want to do it even more.* I know, McGregor has also co-directed 1999's ""Tube Tales"" but he only had a segment in anthology movie. ""American Pastoral"" can be still called his real debut as a movie director."
" The loss of innocence
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"America lost its innocence in the sixties. The post-war dream of a wealthy, successful society which could be an example to the world, was shattered by Vietnam, race riots and political murders. Instead of a shining example, America turned out to be a ruthless, violent and unequal society.The country has never really recovered. The innocence and the optimism of the fifties and the first half of the sixties have never come back. Watergate, Columbine, Sandy Hook, Iraq, 9/11, Waco, you name it.'American Pastoral' documents this loss of innocence. The lead character, Swede Levov, is the archetype of the successful American. Handsome, rich, intelligent, successful, considerate: he is the ideal man, just as America was the ideal society. Or rather: he tries to be the ideal man, just as America tried to be the ideal society.But his life is shattered when his only daughter disappears. Slowly, Swede Levov has to come to grips with the notion that his lovely girl has killed several innocent people in a bombing campaign by a radical counter-culture movement. He starts an obsessional search for his daughter, while his wife develops mental problems, and his company is threatened by rioting, changing consumption patterns and competition from low-cost countries.It's not easy to get all this into a movie. That's probably why it took so long to get this project realized. Director Ewan McGregor does a decent job with this adaptation of Philip Roth's novel (which I haven't read). But it was all a bit too polished to my taste. That's surprising for someone who has risen to fame with Trainspotting, which is the complete opposite of a polished film. What I missed was something surprising, out of the ordinary, something with a sharp edge. A lot of it has to do with how the film looks: even the roughest scenes don't look really rough. The film lacked just a little bit of the roughness, the madness and the craziness that made Trainspotting such a great movie."
