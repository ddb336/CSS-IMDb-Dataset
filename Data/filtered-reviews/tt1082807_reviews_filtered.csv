" It's a cheap rip-off of the Saw franchise without a twisted ending, a charismatic antagonist and the eerie atmosphere
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,2,"Right off the batch, you know who the protagonist is and he manages to be the sole survivor amazingly till the end because it's a cheap movie so it's got to be predictable even for a 10-year-old. They tried to look smart at the end by babbling some scientific and sociological nonsense and it looked ridiculous. Then the guy put the explosives taken out the dead bodies and exploded them all like a super hero which made me cringe a lot. It's a horrible rip-off of the Saw franchise without the intelligent script, a very charismatic antagonist, good actors and the atmosphere. If you want to watch some random people's blowing heads, go for it."
" Truly disturbing
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,6,"Lots of actors you will recognize, but not great acting. What makes it scary is the fact that it is completely plausible in this messed up world that we live in today. Truly disturbing."
" Well made but could have done more
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,7,"It's a really well put together movie with some top notch actors, but I kind of wish they had done more to make the end result less expected. The fact is, if you're genre savvy at any level you can figure out who's going to come out alive in the end. If they'd had the confidence to introduce a few more characters as fully rounded people and then surprised us it would have felt more real, rather than pandering to the power fantasy."
" A waste of time
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,3,"First of all, I'm so sick and tired of how these movies portray black people. It was a total of three black people in the movie.
1st black person was a male security guard. Very stereotypical. He was asleep at his desk (lazy). He was Overweight, dumb, couldn't speak without using foul language, and a coward. Someone even took his gun from him.
2nd was a female. And she was also another stereotypical character. Loud, angry, and spoke in slang (foul language).
3rd was a guy who had no lines. He was killed.
The movie was awful. I don't know how anyone could have let Barry Norris (Their C.O.O) lead them. The entire movie I was waiting on someone to rise up and kill him. Made absolutely no sense. The movie was only half way decent because of all the killing which eventually got old and boring. Do better people!"
" Meh. A Poor Man's 'Mayhem'
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,5,"I mean it was ok, but it basically boils down to 'The Hunger Games' meets 'Cabin in the Woods' except it's set in an office & the tributes are bored suitsThe whole 'normal people thrown into a kill or be killed scenario by an evil 'Wizard of Oz' all seeing big bad' thing has been absolutely done to death, so this is just another in a long line of samey fare.I wondered at one point if it was going down the 'Circle' route.When the voice from above commands 30 deaths, the company boss starts categorising people into folk with kids (deemed worthy of life) & the near-retired folk (deemed easy prey as they're in the autumn phase of life anyway).When he realises there's not enough easy 'socially acceptable' kills, he starts scanning the room, spotting a Muslim lady, a camp gay man, an obese lady & a lady in a wheelchair.I figured 'ahh, so it's 'Circle 2' then' where game players have to start revealing their inner darkness & prejudices to justify kills - I was technically right, as both the Muslim lady & obese lady were murdered not long after this scene, when small gang of middle aged sociopaths desperately starts gunning anyone & everyone down to hit 30 deathsBut yeah - it's just a poor man's 'Mayhem' which has way more fun, way more creative use of office supplies as weapons, etc.One bit that really annoyed me was the sudden WTF moment when the plucky young employee on her first day at Belko looks set to be the final girl - until she isn'tIt would have been so much better if she had won, but they did her (and us viewers) dirty by setting up a 'ooh she's so brave & resourceful & she's doing everything right!' narrative, before we're startled by what I can only describe as a huge 'eff you' to viewers courtesy of the director. I'm assuming the intention was dark humour, but I certainly didn't interpret it that wayEven the ending is the same as 'Circle' /'Hunger Games' franchise- where it's revealed that this whole affair was merely stage one & lone Belko survivors across the globe look set to be in another setting as victors vs victors.Decent way to pass the time, but all in all it was just pretty lazy film-making really"
" Sick
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,1,I am surprised of how sick the human mind can be ... watching movies like this one I can understand why we live in such a dark and negative society.
" I liked it
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,7,"Was it original, nope.but it's still a lot of fun.my only complaint,is that Micheal Rucker was not in it long enough"
" great idea, got ruined in execution
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,6,"When i heard that this was going to be a movie about a bunch of people stuck in an office building who have to kill eachother to survive i thought that would be awesome, but unfortunately more than half of the kills are via firearms, which is something that should not be in an office building, i get that this was all a government experiment and the armory was put there on purpose, but it would have been a lot cooler if we got to see everyone be forced to create their own makeshift weapons with whatever office equipment they could find, but instead the writers went the cheap route instead of being creative. all the non firearm kills were pretty cool, like when that one guy used homemade molotovs, or when people had to fight eachother in melee combat with kitchen knives, that was cool. if you want to make a movie about testing human intelligence then do it, dont just make it a game of who can shoot the most. also the movie was straight up boring for the first 10 minutes, literally nothing happened in that time and it felt like the filmmakers were just trying to stretch out the runtime as much as they could. i also really would have liked it if they werent in a situation with such airtight measures in place to make sure they all followed the rules like bombs imbedded in their heads and indestructable steel walls on the windows, it would have been cool if part of the movie was about some of the characters trying to get out of the building, and maybe possibly succeeding, i know that they tried to some of do that, but every method they used got shot down instantly and they kinda gave up on it in the first half of the movie. overall it was just kinda a watered down, disappointing experience. nothing original to offer, just a generic premise that plays everything by the books"
" Under-rated
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,9,"I have a theory that unless a movie winds up with a nice Hollywood feel-good happy ending, most people don't like it. The viewer needs to see exactly where things are going or they are unsatisfied. For those of us who enjoy something a bit different, a bit twisted, a dark tale, maybe a little sick, this is an immensely enjoyable film. I've seen it a few times because It's like watching really bad news happen to someone else. It's well acted, well put together, with a genuinely interesting story and It's loaded with great actors who usually just get small roles in larger films. It's also a horror film where , for the most part , characters act as people do in real life. On top of it all, this movie is a blood bath. Just showed it to a friend who also loved it. Ignore the lower reviews, this is a well done horror thriller."
" Didn't fulfill its potential, but entertaining nonetheless.
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,7,One thing I'll say is that I was never bored. Some of the writing felt forced and some humour didn't land. It's got plenty of gory moments if that's what you're in to.
" Familiar, but well executed thriller
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,8,"An interesting, engaging little thriller- The Belko Experiment isn't nearly as smart nor serious as it thinks it is- but there is no doubt it is a bloody good time. The film is directed by Greg McLean and written by Guardians of the Galaxy writer and director James Gunn. Although the film is entertaining and surprisingly easy to follow, given the many storylines on the screen, its direction falls a bit flat, with its overly grim nature, that just makes it feel more dull than interesting and more formulaic than unique. The script can certainly be rather average at times as well, but it does do a good job of executing its premise to entertaining levels and providing for some interesting characters to follow. Although I wasn't as big of a fan of the lead actors as I feel I should have been, Tony Goldwyn, John C. McGinley, and Melonie Diaz all provide for some excellent performances as well as Adria Arjona- who gives her part her all, despite its somewhat lacking depth. In the end, The Belko Experiment is a fun and enjoyable little horror flick. It isn't great by any means, it has its weaker moments in terms of direction and script writing, but you certainly won't be bored throughout, and you will be anxious to see how it all finally ends.
My Rating: 8/10"
" Fun ride ruined by cheesy ending
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,6,"Everyone has seen a cool trailer with an interesting concept behind it. It seems fresh and exciting. When you sit down to watch it, the originality of the idea carries it for a while, but at the end you're just sitting their like.., meh. Enter the Belko Experiment. Sit this next to the Purge series on that shelf. Definitely watch, but don't expect to love the ending."
" Action packed kill spree
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,8,Awesome movie! Gore and action packed. Definitely worth the watch. You'll be entertained the whole way through
" A bit pointless and not enjoyable really
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,4,"Another psychological experiment movie, with a whole office of co-workers.The colours were off and too much post processing 'darkness' added everywhere. The director made no real use of the office space, roof, or underbelly of the building as done in other movies.What I'm saying is that they had more room to work with than say the movie 'Circle' which was pretty much a tiny box with 50 people in it. Because of this, the movie was pretty boring and pales compared to the other psychological films I have watched recently.Now the acting was bland, and the characters were a little overtly played right from the beginning. And of the love of Pete the protagonist was an annoying little man who had plot armour and avoided near death about 5 times. This sort of thing is a massive no-no in this kind of movie, because it destroyed any tension at all. After the second case of plot armour I was bored, and then predicted the entire rest of the movie.In this film they had 80 people on the chopping block, more than all of the other films in this genre. And with it the 'game' that was played from the voice in the speakers was very simple. The seoncd example was kill 30 coworkers or 60 of you will die. Could this be any more lazy and bland?As others have said it is similar to Battle Royal, but in my view it doesn't even copy the interesting plot of that film; not even close. It is just a test happening to office buildings across the world. Big deal, any explanation as to why at all?4/10 needs more work in the writing department to make something like this really work."
" Meh...
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,6,"Not much to say about this movie, it has a wafer thin plot just to have a carnage movie. If you like that kind of stuff then watch it just don't expect much meaning behind it."
" Great killing, fun to watch
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,7,"People who are hating on this film were probably expecting something else. It has less than an hour and a half, good killing action, gore, blood, it's straight to the point and it also comments about the dynamics of a work environment, the competition and the fact the people will do anything to be on top, or to be associated with those who detain power."
" Hit or miss, but mostly a miss.
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,5,"This movie is best for people who like gore. I mean, I know the whole movie is based on *a lot* of people being killed but it was over the top in a way that wasn't fun for me. The story, though, I didn't follow it. Why were they in Colombia? It was presented as if that was somehow relevant to the story but it isn't, not as far as I can recall. The end was just... Why? That's all?So there isn't a lot of story to be had anyway. There's a forced office romance, the group of psychopath executive types, then just everyone else. We aren't given a reason to cheer for one or the other since there is no background info on any of them. If we'd been given a reason to care about just one character and their fate, I think the film would improve slightly. Otherwise we are just watching people die in over the top manners.The film is at least somewhat ""fun"". It does have suspense and it never really slows down. The acting is so-so. John C McGinley as an on demand murder side kick was pretty great and he was probably the only character you care to see if they die or not. Tony Wendell as the CEO was well done for what it was. Adria Arjona was not so great. Her performance felt flat.Ultimately, it's a background movie for me. I like horror and this checks a few boxes but not enough to hold my full attention. Like so many others have said, Battle Royale did it better."
" Talk about a rough day at the office
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,8,"A motley assortment of employees who all work in an office building for a mysterious corporation are forced to participate in a brutal kill or be killed blood sport after they find themselves locked inside said building.Director Greg McLean keeps the enjoyably twisted story zipping along at a brisk pace, maintains a deliciously dark tone throughout, generates a good deal of tension, delivers a handy helping of gory violence, and further spices things up with a wickedly amusing sense of pitch-black humor. The clever script by James Gunn not only pokes savagely satirical fun at the merciless cutthroat competitive nature of the white collar corporate work environment, but also makes a grim central point at the vicious extremes people will resort to for the sake of survival.Moreover, it's acted with zest by an enthusiastic cast: John Gallagher Jr. as the likeable Mike Milch, Tony Goldwyn as ruthless top executive Barry Norris, Adria Arjona as the spunky Leandra Florez, John C. McGinley as the weaselly Wendell Dukes, Josh Brener as the nerdy Keith McClure, Melonie Diaz as the eager Dany Wilkins, Owain Yeoman as the levelheaded Terry Winter, Sean Gunn as zonked-out stoner Marty Espenscheid, and Michael Rooker as grizzled maintenance man Bud Melks. Gregg Henry does the voice of the evil mastermind behind it all with spot-on sinister aplomb. Good sick fun."
" By the book social breakdown, blah, blah, blah
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,2,"A white collar retred of George Orwell's ""Animal Farm"" that dances past ""The Purge"" and fails to land any kind of significant commentary.See ""Cube"" or ""La Plateforme"" or even the cartoon of ""Animal Farm"" to get the real message."
" I guess I'm one of few that loves this movie
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,10,"I've only seen a few times cause I had a rough year in 2017 and happy to watch again! Lots of people disliked The Belko Experiment because of lack of originality and other reasons to which I disagree very original brilliant horror. I love the concept, the characters, the dialogue is pretty good, and the voice is great! Unfortunate the movie wasn't appreciated more."
" Quite Good
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,6,Reasonably good film and difficult to criticise it too much for unrealistic behaviour as I don't think that anybody knows how it would occur in their office.The ending was good.
" B-movie, but not so bad
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,4,"The story reminded me a bit of SAW.
The plot was typical of B-movies, somewhat cheap."
" Decent movie with good effects... but prefered Mayhem
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,6,"It was a decent movie dont get me wrong, its worth a watch. but watching Mayhem before this made Mayhem seem very superior. the effects were really good but it was rather frustrating to watch and its been done better."
" Just another day at the office
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,5,Nothing that hasn't been done before in variations of a theme. Most office jobs make you lose the will to live anyway.
" Office Space meets Battle Royal
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,6,"The tagline says it all ""Office Space meets Battle Royal"" Truth is both those movies are better then this one. This is a solid horror movie worth checking out."
" Story at the end could have been good.
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,4,Initially it's fun at the end it's waste of time. Because it doesn't make any sense at last ending could have been more informative
" If you have plot Armor, Then the rules dont apply to you.
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,7,"I really like the concept and setup of this movie.The start is just excellent, A very cozy, Modern, organised office with happy workers doing their daily jobs and socializing together very cozy.
And we know how things will turn out, so that is just a good picture to start with.My issue with the movie is that the main character, Mike, Has plot armor.
In the first case He tries to remove the tracker, Is CLEARLY WARNED, and at this point the overtakers have already shown that they are not bluffing, Yet he keeps trying to remove his tracker. And he gets a 10 Second Countdown ?
Really ? There is 78 people in the building and 1 guy is totally not responding or listening to the rule or warning they just announced. Instead they give him a 10 second countdown...Well okay later in the movie they state some rules and say that they won't give another countdown, So I can let the first case slide, But the same guy gets warned on the roof for putting up SOS signs, but When they are CLEARLY warned to stop, or face the consequences, they still don't blow his tracker when he just continues.
That't just unacceptable script writing.Anything else this movie executes just fine...Although At one point things go a bit too fast and for the viewer it becomes nearly impossible to track who died and who didn't and how many people are still alive and if targets are me or not. The overtakers could use a bit more activity on the megaphone imo.The girl spares the guy when the overtakers just announced they are on 29/30 and only have 2 minutes to make the final kill or 30 more people will die, She knows that they are not bluffing but doesnt kill him anyway. I know the movie needs to get rid of 30 people fast to reach the endgame in time but...Come on....The final objective/ the battle royale the movie really goes into fast pace... Too fast imo. There are people with 11 or 8 kills and people with 0 or 1 kill. With 15 or less people left in the competition at that time, its nearly impossible for the people with 0/1 kills to win, unless they'd take out the kill leaders, which would cause an very aggressive gameplay, which is already the case. But this strategy never really comes to subject.
Now i also want to state a plus, the ending. I thought this was very much going to be an (Spoiler inc) The Cube 2 (Hypercube) ending.
1 person survives, gets into a room with the game creators, they ask some questions and then shoot the survivalist in the head.
So this ending surprised me and I totally didn't see it coming, liked it very much.Its a lot of complaints, but I really like the movie, Its because i like it so much that these shortcommings annoy me so much haha"
" Faithful to the promo, fantastic pace, smart and builds to a fitting finale
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,9,"I loved the slayings in The Belko Experiment. It was pure entertainment. Great soundtrack too, of Latin version rock, tremendous. The actors faithfully gave their all. You'll see a lot of familiar faces from other movies. The build-up was no nonsense, and once things are up and running you go from gasp to gasp. Some great tense moments. It was easy to root for the two leads. Some unexpected moments. Intelligently constructed story, with a chilling hint at the close. It's Friday night and I'm very happy with tonight's movie."
" Gore, gallons of fake blood, some credibility issues ... I expected something else.
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,2,"In Bogota, Colombia, is the headquarters of Belko Industries, surrounded by strong security measures and giving its employees above-average working conditions. Working there seems to be very good for most office workers, as the company promotes competitiveness, individual growth and good salaries. It turns out that in the midst of a normal working day, and after all local workers are evacuated, eighty US employees are arrested on the premises and are invited, by a voice over the office sound system, to massacre themselves or to be mercilessly killed in a distorted social experience.Well, this kind of movie is not quite my thing and I confess I was expecting something different. The massive bet on gore and a bloodbath works for those who like it, but for those who prefer more action, more suspense and psychological horror, the movie won't work so well. It is not a movie for all audiences. And then there are some credibility issues that totally fail: As a company employee, I would never allow anything to be implanted in my body, so that bomb-firing at employees is unreasonable and sounds unbelievable. The rest is just blood. The script does not exist, being only a premise to prepare and conclude the carnage. The same goes for the cast. They are pigs for the slaughter, we don't even care about them. There are some well-known actors in this movie, like John Gallagher Jr., but I don't think they have received decent material to work with. The problem here is bad script and conscious betting on gore and gallons of fake blood."
" Ultra violence
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,6,"80 workers, mainly Americans, are trapped inside an office block in Colombia. A voice from the speakers tells them that they must all die but one, a deadly game of kill or be killed ensues. This is Battle Royale crossed with TV's The Office (a show that I can't stand!). There is a great deal of graphic violence, often accompanied by music (opera, classical or a Spanish language version of California Dreaming), it certainly delivers the gory goods. And for me that was the best thing about it. There is also some humour too, in one scene somebody is bloodily butchered in a toilet, the door is then closed and a sign asking users to keep it clean seen. It is very obvious which characters are going to be left to battle it out at the end, and the plot about this all being part of a social experiment is pretty much irrelevant.
At the end of the day this is a great movie if you want to see people getting graphically killed left, right and centre. And I enjoyed it for that, but nothing more."
" Ripoff schmipoff
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,9,"Written By James Gunn and directed by Greg McLean, the film stars John Gallagher Jr, Adria Arjona, and Tony Goldwyn and centers around countless office workers who find themselves in a fatal crisis which forces them to end the lives of several fellow co-workers or else their own lives will be ended automatically.First of all, we can all agree that the film's premise is nothing new. I've read numerous comments across the internet to films such as Battle Royal and The Purge. To which, I respond by saying ""I'd like to see all of YOU come up with new ideas!"" The concept of the film may not be original, but it is the execution that matters the most. Sure, the actors played it almost completely straight, but I believe that that was the point; it is a survival horror film with comedic elements thrown in.Another thing that is most important is the acting. The acting might not be great, but it is certainly on point for the majority of the film; I should also mention that the character development is surprisingly spot on.Last but certainly not least is the direction, which many reviews have apparently chosen to ignore. The first thing I should say about it is that it's not without it's flaws. The set designs are pretty neat and the gore effects are, there I say, incredible. Now if there's one gripe that I had, it's one scene during the third act. As soon as the bloodbath finally increases, some of the shots look mildly choppy; it was kinda hard to tell who died and which order.All that being said, this is an underrated gem that (much to everyone's dismay) is not meant to be taken seriously. I'm certain that it will gain a cult following in the future and I'm rating it 8.9/10."
" Not too bad
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,7,"Ok, may not have been the most innovative of scripts, but a fun watch. Some rather hilarious effects such as the janitor with a dent in his head after being hit by a spanner - almost worthy of Tom & Jerry. High body count, but my favourite is someone being killed with a tape dispenser. Made me reconsider that this is a film that does not take itself too seriously with some subtle humour whilst, at the same time, showung the flaws of human nature and how people coukd react in such extreme circumstances."
" Horror At It's Best
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,8,"Now I am a little nervous to give out 8s, especially for a movie like this. But I have to admit, it really had me in it's grips all the way until the end. And this is second time I've seen it in two years.Belko Experiment is about a company that has hired American workers in its offices in a Latin American country. One day, only the American workers are allowed in the office. Once inside, all the doors are sealed shut, and it is announced that the last person standing, with most murders, will come out alive.It's a very tense movie. You are involved in the game, because it is also a mystery to you. You're not sure what the employers will do, and the chaos that ensues is pretty wild. You have all your usual suspects as with an office movie. Little do you realize, even the ones you identify with will be eliminated. In the end, only one survives. And though it's mentioned in the beginning you still don't believe. You hope your favorites will make it out alive because they've been built up so well that killing them wouldn't do any justice. They've been cheated.Anyways, it's a wonderful movie. I would recommend watching it today if you are a horror fan. Don't listen to critics.8 stars"
" A satire about the modern corporate world
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,7,"If you're on the fence about watching this movie, absolutely do watch it. The movie is hour and a half long and it just goes with a great pace.Spoilers ahead!Before I mention what made me write this review I would like to get the thing I didn't like out of the way - the ending. After all the craziness of the movie, the movie serve us some exposition, one more payoff and a try to paint the movie into a bigger picture. It felt as they were leaving an open door for a sequel. I thought that the ""second"" ending was unnecessary, even more so after my favorite scene of the movie - the real payoff, the one that our main protagonist has his revenge against the main antagonist.The Belko Experiment and the Modern Corporate World""You didn't change a damn thing.""
""Neither did you.""A bit cheese, a bit on the nose but for me the scene of the fight between the protagonist and the antagonist does a great job of encapsulating the way I feel as a small ant in the anthill (another small wink from the creators) and the struggle to leave a mark or find some meaning in the daily work. I didn't care much about the background of the plot so I would have been very happy if the movie ended under the lights of the corporate recruitment video."
" It Gets Better Each Time You Watch It
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,8,"The first time I watched TBE, I enjoyed it for the pure mayhem, gore and savagery. The next time I enjoyed it for the subtle, but piercing social commentary. The 3rd time I was moved by the story of the characters and felt for some of their fates. This has slowly become one of my favorite movies ever.Greg McLean and James Gunn created a brutal masterpiece that deserved to be explicit, bloody and unsettling. It is well written, well shot and the acting is fantastic. It has great subtle humor. This is far from torture porn as some might have you believe. Not everyone can fully enjoy it, but those who find it appealing might grow to love it. Definitely not a boring movie, and definitely worth watching multiple times."
" Minor version if battle royale and the purge
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,6,"Maybe if you havent seen the 2 movies mentioned above , the script might shock you. Its always interesting to see how different characters reactie different to extreme situations and how groups are formed. The story is Fast ans keeps you going and the achting is fine. However on the end i was not excited are intrigued. Its an OK Movie but on the end iT leaves me with the feeling iT could have been more. More surprising , more distinguished , more cathing. But on a lonely night with a few beers and a bag of chips ....its OK"
" Psychological Horror/Action
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,7,"The Belko Experiment is a twisted little number that satisfies those thoughts and questions from the lizard brain. The ending lends itself to a potential sequel if they really cared to. While the film is enjoyable, I don't think anything about it screamed that it really needs a sequel. I foresee a direct-to-video sequel or two down the road but I'm unconvinced that it'll be a project that James Gunn will be involved with. It stands great as a movie of its own but as most studios tend to do, they overextend their reach out of greed and end up ruining anything that was enjoyable from the first film. So, the real question, would I recommend watching? Absolutely! Despite its predictability and lack of creativity in some departments, the film pulls through very well on its main characters and overall atmosphere. Most people know exactly what they're getting with this movie, so enjoy the ride!"
" my notes
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,4,"A really interesting and intriguing premise but poorly executed. bad acting all around. an unlikable main character. and so many predictable moments. the story did not go in any interesting or surprising directions. so many irrelevant story points. really nothing special in this movie other than a cool idea.and it wasn't funny when it tried to be. this could have been better if it had a funnier tone to all the killing, but this movie tries to be very serious, so when it tries to be funny it just feels like clashing tones (1 viewing)"
" Good movie, unoriginal idea
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,8,"I'm a sucker for gory movies so i got more than enough with this one.
The acting the script ect was good so i had fun with what it was.But the idea was not very original...and we saw it again with Escape Room recently. Same story but with puzzle rooms."
" Belko
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Very good horror film, fantastic actor in a survival story"
" Could have been a masterpiece but it isn't.
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,7,"I'd say more of a thriller than a horror. I can imagine 12 year old me just falling in love with the ethical conundrums and philosophy that this movie throws at you.It's not really much in the way of a conundrum though, I know how I feel about what to do in this situation which would be fine if the movie itself wasn't so fixated on putting its own opinions in the script.I like that there is no obvious protagonist right away. It's just a whole bunch of people on a seemingly ordinary work day. Then things get brutal. They think of everything just about and one can really appreciate the nightmare situation.Despite not really being horror it could have been quite terrifying. But like I said, it gets rather sanctimonious with its obvious attitude that the person I guess is supposed to be our ""hero"" is so in the right and our reluctant bad guy is obviously in the wrong.It's very...Kantian. No, buddy, circumstances DO change everything. No, nothing gives him the ""right"" to take charge and decide who dies but he's just doing what he must to...you know...not die. He's not a great guy but that just makes it feel more like propaganda. Hate the game don't hate the player.It's still an explosive, thrilling ride and even though I don't want to root for the main character it is all pretty satisfying overall with the comedic touches seasoning it nicely.Could have been so much better but I will say it was positive viewing if you can stand moral objectivism."
" Kind of boring
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,7,"This movie was boring. It had a few twists, some good scenes, and a decent storyline. But the execution wasn't good. None of the characters were particularly likeable, the viewer doesn't know who to root for. The ending was pretty good but that hardly makes it worth the watch."
" Office Space meets Battle Royale
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,6,"That's essentially what you're getting with The Belko Experiment (2016), a horror-thriller film written by Guardians of the Galaxy Director James Gunn! Cliche-riddled as it may be, it was interesting to see how the film represented human nature through the story (i.e. groupthink, morality tests etc.). Overall, a fun thrill-ride that is as bloody as it is ridiculous. 👍"
" What's the Point!
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,4,"Okay so let me begin by acknowledging that it is the sort of movie that drew me in. I love this sort of genre. Movies like the exam and circle did it best for me so far.
The performances were great, very believable. It's entirely possible that in that situation, all that would happen.
But here'a my thing though, why do this?
We know that humans are always going to go into survival mode. It's like doing an experiment to find out if 1 +1 will equal 2. That's literally the only problem I have with it. And I fixate so that one reason was enough to just make it a meh for me.
Anyway, that being said it's all blood and shoot shoot shoot and there's a stoner in there to relieve the tension so ...go for it."
" Succeeds at what it's intend to
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,7,"The Belko Experiment is quite a simple plot of a film. Relatively nothing completely new but the film does what it's supposed to do.Employees are trapped inside an office at a typical day of work when they get informed that employees will die via an intercom from a strange voice above. Of course at first the employees assume it's a joke until they found out it's real.We get a sense from the beginning which characters will survive to the end with showing the main protagonist, the love interest and the antagonist villain. Along with a few other key characters.The film has a slow introduction but was needed than about half way through the real intensity begins and things go haywire as expected. Although the film is predictable, the entertainment comes from the gore and violence of some of the deaths.The Belko Experiment is short enough in run time that it never really becomes a bore. Most definitely a film for a certain audience."
" Not Bad But Could Have Been Better
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,6,"Well, The Belko Experiment got a very interesting premise but the execution got its up and downs, so, all in all, I would say the movie is an okay one-timer - if you are interested in such movies about ""psychological warfare"" and survival (of the fittest) and some gore here and there etc.Last note: The Belko Experiment is of course no copy-cat of Battle Royal, reviewers that claim such must be of rather young age, I guess: e.g. Stephen King aka Richard Bachman wrote about such deadly gladiator games or experiments a lot earlier (The Long Walk, 1979, The Running Man, 1982). So Battle Royal (first published in 1999) is just a copy-cat too, and I am pretty sure that there are some pulpy sci-fi novels of the 50s around with such a premise or a similar one ;)"
" It's a bloodbath.
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,6,"The one thing you can say, is it promises to be gritty, and it is, it is quite literally a bloodbath, watching people put under immense pressure, turning from reasonable individuals, into crazed killers when pushed to extremes.I loved the beginning, I thought it was so imaginative, and offering so much scope for different directions. That scope was perhaps the downfall, it could have gone anywhere, and just descends into something a little stupid. I loved the tribal instinct, seeing people split and turn, that was well played out, but ultimately it just went a bit stupid.I would actually recommend it, as on the whole it is worth seeing. 6/10"
" Gory twisted fun
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,8,How did I not even know about this movie? Stumbled on it and sooo glad I did. Gory yes. Some imperfections (I think you have to take a couple of big leaps in suspending disbelief) but soooo much fun. It's saw meets office space.
" Too gross, but had potential
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,4,"This had a lot of blood and guts, I don't care for those too much. I liked the story, just wish it was a little more tasteful. Also there was a scene that reminded me of a school shooting, didn't care for that. But if you like gore, this is it. (Spoiler: Didn't care for the twist, unreal)"
" Ehh
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,3,So pretty much watched it because the cast has a handful of people that I have seen in something that I enjoyed them in. But this movie had to be one of the worst movies I have watched in a long time.
" Fun but gets weird at the end
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,6,"Similar to ""The Mist"", the movie tries to show how humans start making groups against each other in a closed situation. Gory scenes and nice cinematography. But in the end the ""Milch"" guy somehow plants ""bombs"" on all the soldiers and already knows which buttons detonate these bombs although he's half passed out. Weird! And that new latina girl was being shown again and again like she was going to be some kind of saviour but ""boom"" she goes coming down the elevator. Nice popcorn movie anyway!"
" The Belko Experiment: A bit of a let down
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,6,"I'd been looking forward to The Belko Experiment since the moment I saw the trailer, it looked like it was going to tap into a sub-genre I love and the addition of the always excellent John C. McGinley really appealed.The time came around to watch it and as the credits rolled I was left more than a little disappointed. But why?It tells the story of an office block that goes on a lockdown, a mysterious booming voice barks orders at them that they must kill each other off in a sick social experiment. As you can imagine people react differently, and a blood bath ensues.Also starring career villain Tony ""Ghost"" Goldwyn, Josh Brener, Michael Rooker and Gregg Henry this James ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" Gunn written movie is a bloody battle royale type but just doesn't seem to accomplish in its goals.It has little character development, the lack of flow becomes very noticeable around the halfway mark and at no point did I find myself really able to care about these peoples plight.I went into The Belko Experiment with high expectations, maybe that damaged the film for me? Regardless it's a watchable effort but certainly feels like a missed opportunity at something greater. For some reason I was left feeling that the film would have made for a better black comedy, but I'll guess we'll never know.The Good:Great conceptStrong social commentaryQuite a good finaleThe Bad:Doesn't flow all to wellSimply doesn't meet its potential"
" Wow that was disturbing
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,4,"I'm not at all squeamish when it comes to violence and gore, but this is a film that did make me think about whether it can make a film less enjoyable and distract from its overall message (if there even was one here). I'll compare The Belko Experiment to 'Circle', a psychological suspense film I saw on Netflix which is executed hugely differently, but is fundamentally the same essential premise in the end. Both films focus on a group of several dozen people in a constrained space who face the moral dilemma of whether to participate in killing others to possibly save themselves. Circle contained no real on-screen violence at all, but gains its impact on the viewer through the dialogues between characters as they confront their own personal prejudices and decide which of them are capable of killing other humans to serve their own interests. The Belko Experiment, on the other hand, while it does dwell on the ethical dilemma of the situation the characters find themselves in, opts instead for long periods of gratuitous, nihilistic violence, and this is what takes up most of the film's running time. It's one of the most violent films I've ever seen, far more so than exaggerated, unrealistic ones like The Fly 2, because it concentrates entirely on violence between humans, but that doesn't necessarily mean it has any more of a coherent message (if any at all) than these sorts of other films. The basic principle of both films may be extremely similar, but Circle is far better executed by exploring the consciences of characters through words, rather than action. I much preferred the first half of the Belko Experiment, which focuses on the characters' confusion and coming to terms with their situation before drawing the lines between morally good and bad, as opposed to the second half, which was an all-out bloodbath featuring crying people being lined up against a wall and shot, and a man being brutally crushed by an elevator by accident. Was there even a point to all of it in the end? The ongoing romance between Michael and Leandra was perhaps meant to show that there is something deeper to strive for amongst all the violence, but even that proved futile in the end as she was shot and killed (by the way Michael responding to Leandra's contributions by stroking her cheek, saying 'hey hey hey' and trying to shut her up was cringeworthy and pretty lame). The violence was completely meaningless most of the time e.g. Dany being set up as the saviour of the story and spending ages surviving the elevator only to be gunned down literally the very second she emerges by Norris, and it makes you wonder whether there really is anything left for the viewer to reflect on, or did the filmmakers just decide to occupy an hour and a half by having 80 random people stab and shoot each other to death for entertainment. Whilst Circle's (almost) final twist makes you dwell on the nature of human beings for hours afterwards, the Belko Experiment just made me want to forget its brutality and move on. They say offending an audience is better than making them feel nothing at all, which I can understand, so I'll give this film credit for being something a bit more interesting than your standard Marvel film or anything else that's just churned out for money, but I really think there could have been something more here than just an all-out massacre. Near the end of the film, as we change setting away from the tower, Michael was shown literally being carried out of the darkness into the light, but that's really not the kind of message I got from this film and it's definitely not how I felt as a viewer. I rewatched Circle 3 or 4 times afterwards because repeat viewings do let you see the bigger picture better, but I won't be watching this one again as I don't see much to enjoy about it."
" Corporate America
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,5,"Yes I know, it takes place in Bogota. But it is run by Americans. I'm guessing this film was an attempt to visualize and emphasize the everyday challenges that people working for the corporate beast face. It's a funny metaphor, but not altogether well designed. If their intent was to show the struggle between the grunts vs the CEO's, they needed more backstory. Funny concept, but could have been better executed."
" Holy God was this terrible.
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,1,"The music alone turned this into a terrible film. Add in bad acting, following characters who don't mean much and don't last and what do you get? The Belko Experiment. Nothing could save this project, don't make a sequel please."
" A Messy, But Entertaining, Copycat
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,6,"Skip this movie and watch Cabin in the Woods, or Martyrs, or both, since this movie is basically a lovechild of the two, albeit without their greatest assets. ""The Belko Experiment"", while entertaining enough to enjoy while eating takeout in bed, is not something I'd recommend if you're looking for a full-circle psychological thriller. The premise is interesting, but not entirely sensical; the C.O.O. happens to have a background in the Special Forces? They're concerned about workers being kidnapped in Colombia, but can't hire a security guard that seems to know how to defend himself? The stereotypes are also disappointingly cliche; we're given a borderline-psychopath for a boss, a cringeworthily flamboyant gay coworker, a black security guard who's nearly the first one to die, a stoner(?) preaching about chemicals in the water; all of whom contribute very little to the plot aside from their gory deaths and tragically unfunny humor. This film is good for a night-in when you can't seem to find anything else to watch; it has a promising plot but fails to elicit any sort of sympathy from the viewer for the uninteresting characters as they all, gory death after gory death, are eliminated."
" Weak storytelling results in a mess
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,4,"Ah so much potential lost in a sea of mindless blood and gore. Like films such as ""The Cube"" before it, this movie focuses on people trapped in an amoral social experiment to see how they behave.The biggest problem is that most of the major plot lines that are fundamental to the story are half baked and unexplained. Like what the purpose of the experiment was? The other tragedy is that the acting skills of most of the cast (including John McGinley) are grossly and tragically under utilised.If they were less focused on flying blood and guts then maybe they would've thought to take another look at the script."
" Brutally violent.
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,3,"I've always said that brutal gory violence does not a horror film make. Who knew that there was a film industry in Bogota, Columbia? Also, this is written by James Gunn, who also wrote ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". I guess every career starts somewhere."

" Great Premise, Average Film
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,5,"Despite the wacky poster, no one kills anyone with a scotch tape dispenser, which is representative of the missed opportunities for humor and creativity in this film."
" Great movie
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,10,"This is a really great movie I love to watch. The director really put effort into this. It is extremly graphic though with many people's heads being blown off and people being stabbed, burnt or shot its suitable for people over the age of 12."
" An Experiment in Name Recognition
",2018-12-11 00:00:00,2,"Eighty white-collar workers find themselves sealed inside their office building and are instructed via the public address system to murder each other.You might think this sort of outlandish premise would lend itself well to some dark satire or perhaps a morbid horror B-movie appeal. The Belko Experiment proves such assumptions wrong. Directed by Greg McLean, the film comes from a screenplay by James Gunn (Slither, Super, Guardians of the Galaxy) that seems surprisingly unrefined. The story doesn't extend much beyond what I've already described -- there are people in an office, a voice tells them to kill each other, they hesitate, heads begin to explode (literally), people kill each other.The backgrounds and motivations of the characters aren't really provided and everyone can be described as a simple archetype. There's the stoner, the gay, the creep, the nerd, the new girl, and so on. John Gallagher Jr. is our protagonist, depicted as a ""nice guy"" who deplores violence and is pitted against Tony Goldwyn's ""hardass boss"" antagonist who is imploring violence. Gunn regular Michael Rooker is also present, playing a maintenance worker whose only role in the film is to fruitlessly attempt to cut a hole in the metal plating trapping everyone inside. The acting is competent but ultimately all for naught as the colourful characterizations of Gunn's other films are all but absent here.From a visual standpoint, the film isn't terribly interesting either. When we're not looking at a static wide shot or generally shaky action, we get plenty of extreme closeups of somebody's emotionally vacant face, which only conveys that they are as dumbfounded as the audience feels. The special effects being used to present the bloody carnage is effective enough, even sickeningly so, but it's hard to imagine it being anything but off-putting to most viewers. Gore hounds aren't going to find anything satisfyingly shocking here and most other viewers will probably be disturbed by the film's callous depiction of death. Exploding heads notwithstanding, the film's effects are shoddy; the exterior shots of the plated-up office building are laughable, looking dated by about 25 years.What is perhaps the only visually and conceptually satisfying moment comes near the end, wherein one character bludgeons his boss to death with a tape dispenser in a scene cleverly lit by an abandoned PowerPoint presentation. Sadly, this is essentially the only time where the office setting and characters are at all relevant to the on-screen action. I would have thought that a violent battle royale set in an office would be fought with staplers, pencils and paper guillotines, but apparently the filmmakers didn't want to exercise that level of visual creativity. Perplexingly, most of the fighting is done instead with a convenient supply of guns.The conclusion of the story is about as interesting as everything preceding it. It turns out that the Belko company was behind the entire incident. The characters in the film seem reluctant to accept this possibility. ""What if the only reason that we've been here all along is because of this? I dunno, some kind of human experiment...""one ponders. ""Impossible!"" replies the other. Perhaps the audience too could have been surprised by this outcome if it weren't already given away by the title. What exactly the company is seeking to prove with this elaborate and expensive experiment eludes me. Locking people in a building together and forcing them to kill each other or else they'll be killed anyway ... the eventual result seems like a no-brainer.I suspect the film's script is a first draft, forgotten about until recently and now produced solely to put Gunn's name on the poster and piggyback off the successes of his recent blockbusters. The only other possible purpose of The Belko Experiment is to test the audience's patience."
" Predictable mainstream fare
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,1,"I knew the moment I saw John C. McGinley's scrunched up little slit of a mouth and flattened face that this was going to be just another mainstream vanilla attempt at ""horror."" While there is plenty of blood, the entire thing is telegraphed from frame one, right down to the moronic ""doesn't this blow your mind?!"" of an ending.It may be violent and gory but it has all the oomph of a deflated balloon. I can almost hardly even call it horror."
" Battle Royal Hits Colombia
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,5,"Your first day at work is always supposed to be strenuous but having to murder your colleagues in a battle royal style game, was more than Dany Wilkins bargained for. Set in a secluded cooperate office in Bogota, Colombia, 80 Americans are about to start their day, unaware that they are about to play a sadistic game that can only have one winner. The company has placed tracking devices in each employees skull due to the high risk of kidnapping fears. Whilst colleagues are trying to avoid being killed by some of their psychotic workmates, they are trying to avoid the ticking time bombs in their heads that can explode any minutes.
There is something quite delightfully barbaric about switching from a peaceful Mamas & Papas song to the execution-style murders of innocent people. Belko is basically Battle Royal but instead of Japanese teenagers on an island with exploding neck devices attached, it is American officer colleagues with bomb chips in their skulls. However, unlike Battle royal, it lacks the pointless amount of gore and other elements that made it a cult classic. The Belko Experiment is worthy of a sit through but can become easily forgettable."
" some issues but good enough
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,6,"It's Bogotá, Columbia. Belko Industries has a secured remote office building. Eighty American workers find themselves locked inside the building after the local workforce had evacuated. They are told by the intercom to kill their fellow workmates in a twisted experiment.The premise is intriguing even if it's not executed quite right. The moment somebody says that they're not letting any witnesses to leave alive. It becomes the most truthful words spoken in the movie. Everything after that is a bit artificial. I don't mind Barry Norris going military dictator. It's an obvious path for the movie to take but there are other obvious paths not taken. The security guard is unlikely to leave the locked armory with Barry and friends. Even without the keys, they would have tried to pick the lock or bust open the door. It's more logical for the guard to open the door and take out all the ammo. As for the signs, they were never going to work. It seems more logical to start a signal fire on the roof. The smartest thing somebody does is taking out the bombs from the dead bodies. First of all, I can't believe anybody would allow a company to inject something into their heads. Second, it would be the highest priority task to get the bombs out of their own heads. I appreciate the bathroom scene with Mike Milch but that can't be the last attempt. While I have many issues, I still find many of the characters played by solid veteran actors to be compelling enough and they make the thriller compelling. There is one aspect that gets undone by the final reveal. I like the idea of the Columbians killing Gringos for a perverted blood sport. The international reveal takes that away."
" Horrible

" Worth a watcg
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,6,"Finished watching the new movie The Belko Experiments. It is kinda a mix between Battle Royal and Office Space. The movie kept me entertained with its extreme gore and high body count. The plot was pretty simple, and the characters one dimensional though. Worth a watch for fans of gory films. Overall a 6 out of 10."
" Nicely done
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,8,"Despite it's not an original movie, it's still worth your time. Why?The acting is not bad for new comers. The interaction between characters is quite logical, NOT cheesy, NOT exaggerated, and NOT boring. You'll notice that they each behave or react differently to different circumstances. So for sure there's personality in every one of it.The story line is for sure not unique. Although you might think this kind of movie will progress and conclude in this way or that way, well think again. You'll be shocked!As for the environment, there's no flaw. It's what you'll expect from this kind of movie. There are no conveniently placed objects for the protagonist to rise as a hero nor are there people showing up somewhere at the right time and the right place. It's basically random. So you'll notice how natural things are."
" Worth the time
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,9,"It is a very intriguing film with make you think what would you do in a situation like this, well executed and entertaining I recommended it. I do hope they make a sequel I would like to know what is stage 2"
" Nope. Interesting Premise with a Very Poor Execution.
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,2,"Decent concept. But wow, did this fall short.. WAY short.. This film is less interesting by the minute. Just read the synopsis, picture how you think the film pans out.. Automatically, that's better than anything you watch here.. What an unfortunate waste."

" Full of blood chuckling all throughout
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,10,"I loved this film, for one reason and one reason only the bloodshed, the cast were good, and amazingly we did get a backstory to the important characters, the emotion was realistic, the debate in the cafeteria, is very realistic, it poses a very strong political question, who should have the right to decide on who lives or dies, and i think it answers that question gratefully, we see the answers in Barry and michael, who is the answer which is that no one should have the right to choose who shall live and who shall die, there was good suspense sometimes, the plot was very basic i admit, there wasn't as much depth as with other films like it follows, but in the end i didn't care because there was so much bloodshed and brutality, my favourite kills were:
the elevator kill
wendell's death with an axe to the face.
and Barry's death.
and i loved the ending that perfect twist, just as you thought all was over you realise it was just the beginning, i would recommend it to any gore fans, note if your looking for plot development and a strong story this isn't the film to watch, you'll only really like this if you love sheer bloodshed"
" schlocky, funny, b-movie entertainment
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,7,"It's been a minute since I've seen Battle Royale, but from what I remember, what really makes it work is the authenticity with which the kids react to their extreme circumstance. Belko Experiment, while not as thematically strong, largely works in the same way. Most of the Belko employees have fairly believable & varied reactions to their sudden death match, making the escalating intensity all the more effective. Sometimes the violence is a bit much, but mostly this is just schlocky, funny, b-movie entertainment."
" Craziness
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,7,"I admit I like the concept of the battle royal stories. This is definitely one. It has some decent small role charaters Michael Rooker, John McGinley and quite a few more. Not the best acted show. And very little time for character development. It is a blood and guts film but all in all not bad. I enjoyed it for the most part. I think an extra half hour of character work would have made the deaths more meaningful."
" Listen to me...
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,1,"Im all for the gore. I don't care. I like it. BUT. If you are going to present yourself as more than that, then you can't expect us (me) to praise the dumbest parts of the movie at face value like that was the intent.This movie tried to be smart. They tried to ""show how humans really are"", like Jigsaw showing who ""really wants to be alive"", in the context of a bigger experiment done to us, normal people (ala ""The Experiment""). And they failed miserably.Since the moment the movie present the characters you know exactly who they are: The good guy; The awful boss; The pretty and smart lady; The beautiful but not sympathetic/smart lady; Etc.Then the experiment starts and their are put in position to kill or be killed to survive the day, with the controllers saying that only one person would survive. This is the thing though. Usually, there is hope that you can beat them, so the tension is super high when people turn into each other, instead of trying to work together to ""beat the system"". In this atrocity, it is never clear how that could happen. Every little intent from the start is clearly shut down and after a few minutes, you figure (even if some characters in the movie don't) that's just not an option and people have to fight each to survive. So that tension si gone.Then, you have so many cliche characters that you figure exactly what is going to happen at the start of every freaking scene (there might be three or four that are original in some form or another, in the entire movie).Then the ending has a twist that you can see, again, from basically the start of the third act.Also, the acting wasn't the problem, but the insulting and lazy writing, and probably the director not knowing exactly how to elevate a lazy script and fighting for inducing any kind of suspense.I really don't understand how people can give this movie more than a 5 (mediocre), because there isn't even one thing above average here."
" Different in its own way
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,7,This movie is a new fresh story and something i havent seen before. People that likes violence and gore this is your movie to watch. It has its slow moments but necessary slow momentsand it had some humor to it. I thought it would be more violent. The rate of violence and gore from 1-10 i would give it a 7. The heartbreaking about thus movie is theres some good funny charactees and most of the characters are very innoce t going about there daily lives and when you lest expect it bam all of a sudden dead your like no i really liked that character.
" It had good potential but it sucked
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,6,"The pace of story was weak at first, the concept of the idea had great potential, but the outcome of the whole thing ended poorly.

" Under-appreciated Blumhouse horror/thriller is highly derivative, but highly entertaining
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,8,"Crackerjack horror/thriller is highly derivative, but highly entertaining for fans of these sorts of films. A group of Americans office workers find themselves unexpectedly locked inside a high-rise office building and ordered by a mysterious voice over the intercom that they need to murder two of their co-workers within two hours or there will be ""consequences."" Everyone thinks it's some kind of prank until four of their co-workers' heads explode (everyone has been implanted with a tracker/explosive device). That's when the mysterious voice comes on again to announce ""By 2:47 pm, in two hours, we want 30 of you dead through whatever means necessary. If 30 of you are not dead, we will end 60 of your lives through our own methods."" That's when this office space turns into Lord of the Flies. Such a set up could easily have become a predictable routine slog of violence, but ""The Belko Experiment"" was directed by Greg McLean, who memorably directed the highly effective Australian horror film ""Wolf Creek"" (and to a lesser degree the fun giant alligator film ""Rogue""). McClean does an excellent job of building suspense leading up to the explosive episodes of violence. The film was written by James Gunn, who wrote the the surprisingly good ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake along with writing and directing the underrated ""Slither"" and the very popular and somewhat subversive ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films. Gunn also wrote the underrated comedy ""The Specials,"" which is the film that ""The Mystery Men"" should have been. What I'm trying to say about Gunn is that he's someone who has solid horror and genre chops, but he's also someone who brings a fair amount of subversive and dark humor to his films, which elevates ""The Belko Experiment"" from being a simple ripoff of ""Battle Royale"" to being a dark satire on office politics. And on a straight horror level, I need to give McClean and Gunn credit for some of the deaths coming as genuine surprises, which is not something you get see often in most horror films. However, the situations and the characters are highly derivative and something you've seen many times before. People argue about what to do. Everyone realizes there's no escape. Co-workers find themselves breaking off into factions. Character-wise, there's the jerk boss (an excellent Tony Goldwyn), the nice pretty girl (Adria Arjona), the boss' toadie (the great John C. McGinley), the creepy janitor (Michael Rooker), the comic relief stoner (Sean Gunn), and there's, of course, the relatable normal-guy hero (John Gallagher Jr.). These character stereotypes are elevated by a stronger cast than you'd expect from low-budget thriller, but seeing that ""The Belko Experiement"" is from Blumhouse Productions (Get Out, Insidious, The Purge, Split, Upgrade), and is best horror film production company since Hammer, you should expect a quality film and that's exactly what you get. Although ""The Belko Experiment"" is not for all tastes, if you're into these sorts of extreme horror/thrillers, it's is a must see!"
" Not entertaining at all
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,1,"This movie was simply disturbing. I took a date to see it, surprised that she wanted to see it more than I did. She and I just looked at each other as the credits rolled, wishing we had seen something else. Such violence for the fun of it? I don't know, it was an awful movie."
" Just Violence
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,1,"The thinly veiled premise of this movie is how do people behave towards each other when it is a fight to survive. Does humanity or beastiality prevail. However, the reality is the idea is just an excuse for the depiction of people committing extreme violence."
" Nothing new
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,4,"A poor version of Battle Royale, nothing really original, as there have been numerous movies over the years sharing the same plot. There are lots of employees in this company, so the directors try to interest us in only a handful of them, which sadly does not go that well either, since we do not know any background information on any of these characters. The vast majority of this film is extremely blatant and predictable, you feel as if you have watched this movie a hundred times, because this movie has no fresh ideas, they just recycle the old gory scenes from older cult classics of the genre. When you make a movie of this sort involving a large amount of people, you need a way to kill them off and quickly, which takes a huge amount of suspense and fun out of it, since more than half of the characters are utterly useless, running and screaming providing next to no entertainment. If a situation like this occured in reality more than 6 out of 80 would be ready to fight until death just to survive and return to their families. Instead of that the complete opposite happens in this film, people die for absolutely no reason without giving any effort to survive. All in all, a movie you can easily pass on, nothing new, same old genre shticks overused into a compilation of really bloody and unoriginal scenes. The ending of this movie implies an obvious sequel, which could be a potential possibility to make things right, since the premise of this sequel seems to be much more interesting.  If you love this survival horror genre, there are far better movies to watch, for example, ''Battle Royale'', ''Nine Dead'', ''Circle'' and ''Exam'' just to name a few."

" Cynical waste of time.
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,1,"There's something vaguely 80's about this movie - a time when you could still get a fair bit of money to make a film with no purpose, and stand a decent chance of it making it in front of a few people. The violence, of which there is a staggering, ugly amount, is very of the moment, but not in any considerate or thoughtful way. This is a profoundly thoughtless movie, with a few good actors struggling to find something to cling onto - but in a movie with no point, and no message, nothing but brutality and a camera that lingers over pain, they never find it. This film made me feel really bad. I'm sad that I watched it. The trailer was cut like it was a dark comedy, and there's just...nothing even vaguely amusing about this. It's not even imaginative horrible violence and cruelty, you've seen it all before, and the direction flops between explicit, Raimi-esque fountains of blood and people dying because they got bopped in the head. It's miserable, and you can find something better to watch."
" Saw meets Battle Royale.
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,8,"The Belko Experiment, Saw meets Battle Royale. Not a patch on either of those films, but the slightly lo-fi production really gives this an edge and it's very effective. Kill or be killed. Good guys, bad guys, really bad guys. It's a moral bloodbath!"
" Why this is bad.
",2018-05-15 00:00:00,1,"Well, starting us off, this isn't a horror movie at all, sure it has blood in it and violence but... there is no really sense of urgency or suspense in this movie. And because of that this gory effects just seem silly and laughable.
Second of all, most acting is really bad and the character's actions/reactions to what's happening around them just seem so unfitting to their poorly developed characters.
Also... there was a reasonable amount of times that this movie attempted at comedy and I didn't found none of the jokes funny or even fitting to what was happening at the moment, and it was really weird.
Cinematography is acceptable, but oh god some of the special effects are really bad, I laughed when they left the building in the end and that green screen just looked so fake. And also, what the heck is up with that ending when they pull that philosophical crap, expecting us to take the movie seriously? Like this was a really well done thought provoking movie? Well...no. 1/10"
" The premise doesn't stand up to scrutiny but there's some silly fun to be had if you can stand the gore.
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,6,"'The Belko Experiment (2017)' has an interesting central premise that unfortunately doesn't stand up to much scrutiny and isn't helped by an unambiguous ending that simultaneously reveals too much without explaining anything. The core concept, mostly in terms of the villains' motivations and the validity of their experiment, falls flat when you think about it for more than a few seconds, but it could be trying to 'satirise' the way they justify their actions as opposed to presenting their justification as legitimise. Still, the wider 'satire' isn't quite as successful as it perhaps should have been, or was intended. Some silly moments punch through the generally realistic tone and the tangible violence - which is helped by wonderfully splattery and gruesome practical effects - offers plenty of brutal enjoyment, though. It's just that the story and characters are somewhat lacking. 6/10"
" Six out of ten seems about right.
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,6,"John Gallagher, Jr. ('The Newsroom', ""10 Cloverfield Lane"") stars in this attempted satire / bloodbath, referred to in one quote as ""Office Space"" meets ""Battle Royale"". He plays Mike Milch, just one of 80 employees working in an American corporate office in Bogota, Colombia. (Just what it it that this company actually does, nobody knows.) One day, the regular security detail is gone, and a disembodied voice (Gregg Henry) informs the people in this heavily isolated building that they have now been placed in a genuine do or die situation. The building is sealed off, and now these office drones are ordered to either start killing each other, or get the ""tag"" implanted in each persons' head to be detonated.This is nothing we haven't seen before, to be honest. Written and co-produced by James Gunn (""Slither"", ""Guardians of the Galaxy""), who was originally set to direct, it's yet another examination of human behaviour. More to the point, it's the portrayal of human beings under extreme stress. Who has what it takes to survive? Who's willing to murder other people non-stop in order to ensure their own survival? As Gunns' story plays out, some people naturally consider their lives more important, and panic is pretty much the order of the day. Mike is one of the few individuals who tries to keep a level head.Directed by Greg McLean of ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Rogue"" fame, ""The Belko Experiment"" may be patently unpleasant and ridiculous, but it's never, ever boring. One problem is that with so few characters for whom one can actually root, the viewer is likely to end up wanting to see EVERYBODY meet a glorious, hideous demise. But who, knows, that may have been the point. The movie is certainly good for some non-think, over the top, visceral mayhem with tons of digital splatter. It wastes little time, beginning the story proper with just a bare few introductions to characters.Say what you will about the characters involved: this viewer had to develop a grudging respect for the head honcho played by Tony Goldwyn (""Ghost""), who adopts an utterly ruthless attitude and racks up an impressive kill count.Other familiar faces include the always reliable John C. McGinley ('Stan Against Evil') and Michael Rooker (the latter a Gunn regular, as is Henry), as well as Rusty Schwimmer (""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"") and Abraham Benrubi ('E.R.').Punctuated by some amusing black humour, ""The Belko Experiment"" managed to keep this viewer interested despite the familiar scenario.Six out of 10."
" Last Man (or woman) Standing...
",2018-04-10 00:00:00,7,"Somewhere outside Bogota, someone built an office block where 80 people work as a kind of international staff agency. Or so they think. Which means they are surprised when impenetrable steel shutters seal the building, and a voice tells them that they must kill two of their number within the next 30 minutes or there will be repercussions. Yeah, like it will stop there, right?Spoiler - the intention was always for only one to survive, and our job as audience is to guess which one it will be - or will there be others?I guessed wrong - no surprise there.This simple - and, it must be admitted, not unfamiliar - scenario is executed (pun not intended) professionally, involving sympathetic people, unsympathetic people, and a large number of completely anonymous people who are there simply to fill out the ranks.The reason for this carnage, when revealed - social experiment to see how people react when put in a situation where they have to kill each other for no reason - makes no sense. Why? And if that is the reason, why don't the hidden masters of the game take out the ones who are clearly ready to kill during one of the culls, thus increasing the pressure on the others.The strength of this films is that it sustains interest throughout its running time, but ultimately it is ridiculous nonsense, pandering to those who simply like wholesale slaughter. Writer James Gunn can do - and has done - much better."

No household names here for the most part, but still some noticeable players and overall a nice job of casting and acting. Tony Goldwyn is surprisingly good as the lead villain and I always enjoy John C. McGinley and his ability to get under your skin.Directing/Production: Average - 55
Nothing groundbreaking or special in this category, but the story has a good flow to it and the movie moves along well without any meaningless scenes. One could argue the movie moves along a little too fast toward the latter part of the film. The production value is solid and the movie has no indication that it wasn't produced for the level of the film.Story: Average - 55
The story really isn't anything new and the idea that only the strong (smart) survives has been done many times over. The concept is very much in line with the Saw series where individuals are pitted against one another testing their own will to survive.Entertainment Value: Above Average - 60
As mentioned above the movie has a good flow and you don't get a chance to get bored with it. It is extremely violent, gory, and even a little troubling to watch as the content is not for the weak at heart. If those things don't bother you, check it out.Power Rating: 57.5"
" Garbage
",2018-04-03 00:00:00,1,"Absolutely trash. Predictable start to finish. Poor character development. Couldn't care less about the protagonists survival, in fact spent most of the movie hoping he would be next on the chopping board. Unsurprisingly he survived the entire ordeal and also managed to sneakily plant explosives on all his captors at the end of the film, detonate them, and survive again wow! What a twist! 
That being said I would love to see what the premise for the sequel would be, as it is left open ended for a second film, perhaps all the survivors of each experiment will apply for a job with Celko industries, a shady overseas company with an unknown job description.. Commence phase two!!"
" *spoilers*
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,3,Always love this idea but this was poorly executed. So what is this super alloy the torch couldn't get thru? No explanation of this. No character development and my biggest pet peave. So if 30 people were killed not 29 how would of stage 3 worked? Exactly the same way only one person would leave. I could write a novel about this movie being bad but I will spare you. Good gore effects is all.
" Asks a lot of good questions, lacks in answers
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,4,"I've been looking forward to this movie, I wasn't so disappointed by the overall concept, but the execution left a lot to be desired. This movie aims to tackle morality, what is good and what is bad and whose life is worth more. It reminds me of the Stanford Prison Experiment which we briefly covered in psychology - what do people do and how do they change if they're put in a position of power. Unpacking that psychology was interesting in the movie but I feel like we never get close enough to any of the characters to really care & there is a lot of 'convenient' killing for the sake of not having to do that deep dive that the topic asks for. It's a pretty gorey and blunt film that begs the question but fails to answer. Acting was decent enough, would I recommend it? Probably not, it shows us things we already know and expect but fails to provide any logic or reasoning, or offer any alternative perspective."

This film feels like an overplayed improvisation game that the actors played in order to warm up for the real performance - not realising it was the actual film. As I started watching this film I thought to myself, ""I think I'd rather watch the effects of starving rats in a cage. Least the drama would be authentic."" So bored of this voyeuristic snuff pulp. Only possible reason that someone would enjoy watching this trash is because they secretly wish to kill a colleague at work, and perhaps need to seek professional help instead."
" A ""Battle Royale"" - ""The Hunger Games"" copy...
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,5,"""The Belko Experiment"" is a thriller horror movie in which we watch a social experiment taking place in an American corporate office in Bogota of Colombia. This social experiment is very simple, you have to kill and not be killed by someone else. The winner would be the last survivor. I have to admit that I expected more from this movie and that's why I was disappointed by it. It's a bad copy of ""Battle Royale"" and ""The Hunger Games"" due to its low budget and an average cast. Of course, the main difference is that it takes place in an office and on an island. Despite that, I liked the interpretations of John C. McGinley who played Wendell Dukes and John Gallagher Jr. who played Mike Milch. The direction which was made by Greg McLean was average due to the lack of twists and a good plot. To sum up, I believe that ""The Belko Experiment"" is an average movie with a poor plot and not many good scenes. If you have high expectations from this movie it would be good to reconsider watching it if you want to watch a movie just to spend your time then this is your movie."
" High expectations. What a waste of a good cast.
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,4,"SPOILERS! When I heard the concept, I was excited. It was marketed as ""Office Space meets Battle Royale."" It was not. The first thirty minutes are promising but it's all downhill from there. You have a horror film that has John C. McGinley and Michael Rooker and they aren't even the main antagonist? McGinley is more like a side character. He could've been a great main baddie. Like an evil Bob. Instead he's just playing creeper, and not even a likable creeper. Haha. Rooker is totally wasted as well. Tony Goldwyn, while a competent slimeball in Ghost does not seem like he should be the main baddie, a special ops guy who easily gets bludgeoned at the end? That's one of many nitpick things (killing off Dany in a lame way, not even a struggle; lame payoff). The movie doesn't know whether it wants to be funny or serious. It should've been played for laughs (a la Cabin in the Woods), instead it's just kind of depressing. Most of the people who get mowed down don't deserve it. If anything, the cast is good, to their credit...most notably James Gunn. But yeah, disappointed."
" Nothing more than to pass time

The Belko Experminent actually wasn't as bad as expected after reading several reviews; but it also wasn't that great either. Ill try to keep this as short and sweet as possible:Positives:Fun - didn't find myself bored at any point
Gory - Rather creative with the effects and methods of death
Cast - poor dialogue for what seems a rushed film, although the acting wasn't all that badNegatives:Plot - washed up idea used several times with many many many plot holes
Romance - pathetic and unnecessary loved up part of the movie which plays no relevant part in the film at all
Ending - clearly rushed with not much thought put into it, closing scene is expected.Conclusion:Enjoyable, gory film that looks promising to begin with, but after an hour you find yourself looking at the time hoping the ending comes soon; and when it does, you guessed it anyway."

" Vaguely watchable trash
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,3,"A film that exists as an 'idea', where the whole thing is summed up by the premise (sort of like an average Saw film in that respect). It simply doesn't deliver on the premise. Whatever you imagine will happen based on the concept, is probably a bit more interesting than what does actually happen. I spent most of the film distracted by what I'd have preferred to have seen, and how much more engaging it could have been. Its like the writer had an idea, rushed out a vague first draft, then thought ""that'll do"" rather than think ""but actually, I'll try and make this a good film and build something worthwhile on the idea"". Its typical Netflix trash unfortunately."
" An unoriginal waste of time
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,4,"Greg McLean's ""The Belko Experiment"" is a movie that probably could be improved by almost anybody watching it. I don't think you go into a movie as familiar and empty as this without having some idea of something you'd like to see that the movie doesn't deliver. You want something - anything - different or surprising. You leave disappointed.Let's start with the casting. ""The Belko Experiment"" has four veteran character actors in it who all do exactly what you expect them to do because you've seen them do it in almost every other movie you've ever seen them in. It would have been so easy to surprise the audience just by giving these guys something to do that we haven't seen them do before! How hard is that? They didn't even have to change the script. All they needed to do was make John C. McGinley or Tony Goldwyn a good guy for once!(or Michael Rooker or Gregg Henry).The set-up is nothing anyone who has seen a horror movie in the last twenty years hasn't seen, but that's not the problem. The problem is that it does nothing - NOTHING - you haven't seen before. Even the violence is nothing new. The ""Saw"" movies and any of the recent iterations of ""Texas Chainsaw"" or even ""Final Destination"" or ""The Human Centipede"" pushed the envelope as far as it can go in regards to creativity in regards to death on screen, or what horror movie fans call ""kills"". ""The Belko Experiment"" provides nothing new in that regard.Or any other.It's basic premise - average people pitted against each other in a game of survival - has perhaps never really been a novel idea. ""The Most Dangerous Game"" came out in the 1930s. The best example of this story, ""Lord of the Flies"", came out soon after. Since then - especially in recent years - we've had a bunch of reheated examples of the same idea: ""Battle Royale"", ""The Hunger Games"", ""The Purge"", ""You're Next"".All I can say that struck me as different with this movie is the fact that it is set in Bogota, Colombia. The movie does absolutely nothing with this detail; the movie could be set anywhere, and in fact, would probably work better if it was set in a big city in the US or Japan, places where we imagine a lot of people toil away in office spaces. So why set it in Colombia, especially if you're not going to do anything with it? Since the opening scenes are completely superfluous to the film, it seems likely that some deal was struck with the Colombian government that they would get funding to make this movie if they set it there, and showed parts of the country at least once.The plot is about a group of office workers who are locked in their skyscraper and told over loudspeaker that they will be killed if they don't kill each other first. How will they be killed? There are trackers implanted in their skulls that each have a kill switch embedded. This last detail is pure science fiction and seems completely out of nowhere and jarring when it is introduced, no matter how slyly the movie tries to slip it in like it's nothing out of the ordinary. The movie seems at pains to make you believe that this is your average, run-of-the-mill office space. They even include John C. McGinley in the cast, who was, you know, in a movie called ""Office Space""! That being the case, why did they add this weird science fiction detail, which only further undercuts their own movie - already undermined by it's weird, unacknowledged setting in Colombia, of all places?Don't tell me, I know: it's because the movie hinges on the idea that the bad guys controlling the ""experiment"" need to be able to kill the workers easily. Without that, they might not have any way of making the workers start killing each other, which is the movie's whole and entire reason for existing. A decent screenwriter could have come up with something halfway believable as a catalyst for bloodshed. ""The Belko Experiment"" was not written by a decent screenwriter.""The Purge"" got around problems like this by being set in the near future. ""Belko Experiment"" could have done the same thing.""Spoiler warnings"" don't apply to movies like ""The Belko Experiment"". Once you know the set-up, you know what's going to happen. There's nothing in it to surprise or challenge or confront or disturb you. It's a lame non-experience, not even really a good time waster. You can waste your time in more entertaining ways than this.Greg McLean, who made the above average ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Rogue"", looked at one time to at least be an original voice in horror movies. However ""Wolf Creek 2"" and ""The Belko Experiment"" just reveal him to just be a hack who's out of ideas."
" Really?
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,3,"What could have been a dark horror-comedy turned out to be an unfocused, unfunny and uninteresting exploitative pulp-horror"
" Fine little action/horror movie
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,8,"THE BELKO EXPERIMENT is a really exciting little B-movie action/horror film with a premise that shamelessly copies that of BATTLE ROYALE and sets it in an office building instead of an island. A bunch of ordinary workers are tasked with killing each other by a bland and faceless corporation as part of a social experiment. There's little originality here, but a ton of endlessly violent scenes which are well-shot by Greg McLean, the director of WOLF CREEK, and written by James Gunn, the man behind SLITHER and GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. There's a huge tableau of mixed characters to get to know and watching their characters react to the violence in different ways is interesting, but this is mainly about suspense, shocks, and a whole variety of murderous mayhem. Tony Goldwyn, John C. McGinley and Michael Rooker are perfect as the older cast members but the younger actors are just as good here and the whole thing is thoroughly entertaining, if derivative."
" An Experiment in Depravity
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,6,"An office building in Bogota, Colombia, full of workers from western countries (namely America), is sealed shut and the employees are told they have to kill 30 employees or else 60 of them would be killed. To prove it wasn't a joke a few were killed at random. From there you had the people divide into two distinct groups: those that did not want to take a life and those that would take a life if it meant saving their own.I'd seen a similar movie in Hunger (2009), Kill Theory (2009) and (to a lesser degree) Vile (2011). All of these movies are essentially about the depravity of certain people. I don't mean those people that would resort to killing to save their own hide, that is more-or-less a natural thing to do. I mean the depravity of those people forcing others to kill. It takes a special type of mental derangement to think of an elaborate setup whereby you can force people to kill one another.Even though I'm perturbed by the thought of such an experiment it still interests me. What would I do? What would my coworkers do? It wouldn't surprise me if some relished in the license to kill while others shied away from it. It's unfortunate that in these situations the savages are rewarded. They're rewarded with life though they may be haunted for the rest of their days (one would think).The Belko Experiment gave us that glimpse into (hopefully) an impossible twisted situation in which you can't watch without identifying with one character or another. Am I the killer that will do whatever it takes to remain alive? Am I the hider that stays clear of everyone to avoid it all? Or am I the altruist that tries to save everybody while knowing deep down that I can't? Some interesting food for thought."
" Great idea, fairly good execution.
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,8,"The Belko Experiment starts off very interestingly, although the idea of a forced battle royale has been used in the film industry many times, the setting,an office building, brings about high expectations for the viewer. James Gunn's script is mediocre, as it has an unnecassary romantic relationship and mostly characters the viewer does not care for. Yet, it has some characters I have found interesting to watch. The film also offers twists you wouldn't expect from it and such surprises make the film more fun to watch. The acting is generally mediocre and combined with poor characters, it validates my decision of not giving this film a ""9"". The cinematography was exceptionally good for a film of this calibre. The gore was just the right amount as well. Overall, I have found the film very enjoyable, and would love to see a possible sequel in the upcoming years, hopefully with an execution that the idea deserves."
" Solid and enjoyable if somewhat flawed
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,7,"Working in an office high-rise, the workers of a multinational corporation in Colombia finds themselves forced to participate in a social experiment by their employers forcing them to kill a number of the other employees and sets off on a crazed series of encounters to follow the instructions.This here was quite the enjoyable and exciting effort. Most of what makes this one such a fun film is tied into the initial concept of what's happening and how this one goes about letting that idea get played out. Having set up the whole process of the experiment to be carried out through the employees in a forced method of mass-chaos comes off rather nicely as the main plotline, and the idea is quite novelly attempted here with the use of tactics that are set in place by the company turned around on everyone else. The manner in which it turns around and everyone brings their own biases into the equation following the freakout is where this one scores nicely by being able to form the different groups for their individual course of action causes this one to be rather fun and enjoyable with the manner in which it descends into that form of chaos. With this one spouting off commentary about humanity and the human condition in the situation, it develops some really enjoyable elements with how they tackle their orders, which gives this one some of it's finest action scenes here. The initial sequence of forcing people to line up and get shot execution-style before the release of the group as a mad dash of swarming patrons in a hail of gunshots in the panic of everybody running for safety is quite impressive, as well as the later showings of the people running wild throughout the building forced to partake in the secondary part of the experiment regarding all-out warfare between those left alive. These here really force this one along in terms of selling itself on its main premise nicely which ups the craziness and the action considerably and making for a rousing final half here of this one engaging in plenty of brutal methodologies to give this one some solid gory kills. These here are the film's better qualities as there are a few flaws to be found here. The main issue to be had here is the complete and total lack of purpose behind what the game is actually supposed to entail or prove. Not only is the answer taken away from us at the right moment to find out, but there's little point in setting this one up which makes this one seem a little at a loss as for what's supposed to happen. As well, there's also the fact that this one just takes way too long to get going as the film's constant spouting off about the human condition and what the groups are trying to accomplish to get everyone out that it takes about an hour to get going with its central premise about people taking each other out in the office building, and that goes through such a small part of the film that it can be a disappointment. Alongside the overuse of gun-play in a horror film, these here are what hold it down.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language."
" What would you do in this situation
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,5,"Nice plot, but have seen many films like this. Its an experiment to read human emotions and reactions at different instances. This cant be termed as horror, it can be said as thriller. But at several instances, it asks us a question ""What would you do in this situation"""
" A ""Pass Time"" Movie
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,8,"In this movie there are workers who are being tested in a locked workplace. There is only one way out which is to be the last one standing. There is a mysterious voice who watches them and detonates them if needed. This is an experiment called ""The Belki Experiment"" which watches how people react to certain challenges. I think it is a good movie and a good time passer, but I don't really recommend it."
" Who Says Hard Work Never Killed Anyone?
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,5,"This 2016 thriller focuses on a bunch of employees who become trapped in their office building somewhere in Colombia where they become part of a deadly, survival game. Tony Goldwyn (Ghost), John C. McGinley (Point Break) and Michael Rooker (Guardians of the Galaxy) are featured. This isn't bad, it has a lot of tense and gory moments and the cast is decent. I'd give this a try at least once."
" A bit too long
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,6,"Honestly, this movie was just about ten seconds too long. The ending with him killing the supposed facilitators and leaving the shed would have been cathartic enough. But the pan out to reveal the multiple screens and voice over beginning the next phase of the experiment just seems like lazy sequel bait."
" Meh. Nothing more than what the 2 line summary plot offers
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,4,"I expected some intelligence from this movie considering its premise and how survival usually goes, but i guess it was just a gore fest with nothing else to offer. I kept waiting for some really sharp thinking to come into play but the film fails miserably at bringing any freshness to the genre. It almost appears that once the filmmakers had the movie idea they considered that alone was gonna be the script and no further thought was put in around the general movie premise. Survival horror thrives on giving the viewer that ""brilliant moment"" where the chaos and gore is leading up to but this film fails. If the filmmakers were to announce that they came up with the entire script while taking a 10 min dump , it would not shock me. 4/10 for Blood and gore"
" 'Battle Royale' in office
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,7,Good:Interesting concept. Some good acting and characters. Some intense and disturbing moments.Bad:Very predictable story. Lacks originality.
" I'm not sure what result I expected, really
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,6,"The Belko Experiment is decent entertainment until the final ten minutes or so, with a too-soon ending that (oddly) could have used some more exposition. But overall, it's vicious in its profile of the human spirit and the evil that men do when confronted with a moral quandary that has no positive outcome.The Belko Corporation is headquartered in a high rise outside of Bogota, Colombia. It's not clear what they do, but everyone dresses in business attire, so it must be something important. On this particular day, security seems to be even tighter than usual, with local soldiers asking employees for ID and with temporary workers being unexpectedly turned away.We meet some of the staff. Mike (John Gallagher, Jr.), an exec; his love interest Leandra (Adria Arjona), the creepy Wendell (John C. McGinley), and the big boss, Barry (Tony Goldwyn), plus many others. Looks like a humdrum day for office drones. That is, until all of the windows - and door - are suddenly covered by thick metallic barriers, and a voice comes over the PA system. The voice tells staff that in thirty minutes, they - the staff - must kill two people, or else more will be killed. Some believe the incident to be one big joke, but about 30 minutes in, the backs of some people's heads explode. No, not snipers. You see, every employee at Belko has a chip in the back of their head. Because it's Colombia, you see, and there are always kidnappings (particularly of foreign nationals). Just a way for the fine folks at Belko to keep track of you, should you go missing. But, as you've probably guessed, those chips are actually explosives, and that's how we know the baddies are serious.Chaos reigns for much of the rest of the film, as people realize there's no way out of their predicament. A couple of camps emerge, one that wants to kill fellow staff so that they themselves can live, and another that wants no part of the killing. Man versus fellow man. Who will prevail? Probably not man.For the most part, this is a fine movie. Maybe not one you want to think about too much, but then again there's not much to think about. We know only enough about the characters to kind of care about their fates. And, for the most part, we don't know anything about the forces outside the building. True, the internal conflict is what drives the movie, but perhaps a little more about why this is the case would have been helpful. The performances are good, but not exceptional."
" Interesting Shocker based in an office block
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,6,"Belko are a global company that you just hate as they have smug slogans and pretend ethical standards, anyway we catch up with them in their new office in Bogotá, Colombia. Here they have some eighty Americans and one token Brit working with the locals. Then all the Colombians are given the day off and only the Americans are left.Nest without any warning the shutters come up, locking them in, and a voice being belted out from somewhere tells them they all have to start killing each other. Any attempt to resist will, of course, be futile but to say anymore may ruin the fun for you.Now I am usually not partial to a lot of blood splatter or gore fests but this is actually done really well and the acting is generally of a high calibre – even though there are no A listers here but some seasoned players. It is not a huge budget effort either and some may say this is a poor man's 'Battle Royale' but hey plagiarism is a form of compliment and I liked both films – so recommended."
" An Unoriginal Disappointment.
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,5,"Wow...another completely unoriginal Battle Royale ripoff...with the most stupid ending I've ever seen. Period.I mean, if you want mindless regurgitated killing, with little imagination involved...I guess you could get into this, and like it in the end.If you haven't seen Battle Royale...you should watch it first. With that being said, the basic premise here, is that a bunch of Americans are confined to an office building in Colombia, and told they are required to start killing each other off if they want to survive. And if they aren't willing to comply with these directives...they have been fitted with an explosive implant, that will be detonated if they do not follow the rules. The rest is just a killfest...or, more accurately, a yawnfest...because the kills are absolutely void of any creativity whatsoever.And, of course, they set themselves up for a sequel...because they obviously want to cash in on an easy paycheque, by continuing to perpetuate unoriginal crap.It's really starting to look like Wolf Creek's Greg McLean is a one off hack that is in it for the money...because he didn't even try here.What a disappointment.5 out of 10."
" Gripping haunting film.
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,10,Amazing film it had me hooked from the very beginning the most haunting part in my opinion is when the boss plays music to drown out the screams and begs of the employees. After watching this film you will look at your boss and co-workers in a different light.
" Hm, what's the most uninteresting way to show a good premise?
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,5,"The Belko Experiment is a movie about this group of office workers working in a company in Columbia. One day, the entire building is just with metal doors so they can't get out and this voice on the speakers tells them that they must kill a certain amount of people in the group, or else they are going to kill more.It's an interesting premise, that's for sure. That alone got me interested to see this movie. But aside from the premise, there is not much to it. While it still manages to provide some suspenseful and surprising gory moments, it's still not quite gripping enough. The characters are painfully boring and uncharismatic, or just over-the-top and cartoonish. It really didn't work. You can see that in the protagonist and the antagonist alone. The protagonist is all nice and heroic (and extremely uninteresting), while the antagonist is insanely evil. And they both seriously lack charm to make anything about them interesting. That's this movie in a nutshell. And that's what broke the whole plot. Another drawback is a really bland and boring direction that only drains the tension. It's still not as big of a drawback as the characters though. And then that ridiculous ending (with another cartoonish antagonist) with villains like they came out of a straight- to-DVD movie and a tacked-on sequel set- up. So, I guess there's gonna be another one. Yay...I suggest you skip on this one. The premise is great, but wasted in every possible way."
" waste of time
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,2,"Don't know why, but of some reason, I really had high hopes about this movie?Well, where should I begin? Then again, since I feel the movie wasted an hour and half of my life, why would I waste any more time describing the s**t that this movie is.So lets make it short. Only good thing was the actors. Was actually some really good acting in the movie from time to time.Many characters felt really believable. But everything else was really bad. The story was just dumb. The gore was actually unnecessary many times, and most often badly done. Well, IMO, don't waste your time watching this movie...."
" Incredible story
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie definitely deserves a higher rate. You just have to deeper understand the movie and the message it sends. Do not look at it just as an non-human experiment. Don't you think that the whole world is in the similar situation?! Haven't you ever seen people pushing others down to climb higher? Don't you know people that will always be in the shade of someone else? One of the movies that makes you think about the world we are living at. Also, a big allegory of life itself."
" Worth of watching it
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,7,"Not the best, not the worst. Has it's potential and million of possible outcomes and story lines. Some say it lack of originality and creative work, however, it was only one of the possible outcomes , either way, it seemed realistic, without bullshit inventions to make it, like many say, ""creative"".It is interesting, yet, I dunno why people expect to watch a new version of matrix, fight club, either any other possible classic.Sure the scenario is familiar, nothing new, neither old, just a new story exactly what a movie could give us."
" Twisted Battle-Royale style black comedy.
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,7,"Cracking, well-paced, mid-budget, action-packed, black comedy which is certain to liven up your evening (and, maybe, have you looking upwards for snipers). The comedy elements are a welcome relief, interspersed, Bond-like, throughout the film.It is certainly never boring. The action doesn't let up for a moment, with some quite good acting, especially by Tony Goldwyn.Ultimately, however, the fact that there are so many characters involved, there is little time to develop them during its hour and a half run time. Rather than routing for anyone in particular, you find yourself wondering what's going to happen next. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, as no one deciding to watch such a film will expect a character-based acting tour-de-force.Surprisingly, the main characters aren't who you initially think they may be - there's no Hollywood cliché and political correctness involved in who survives, and it is this unpredictability that keeps you watching.At the end the raison d'etre is explained, so you can perhaps forgive the final scenes, which stretch credibility somewhat.I would recommend for those with strong stomachs and a sense of humour."
" Although it was very been there done that there was still enough to keep you watching till the bitter end
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,9,"PROS: The most remarkable part of the film was the acting. There was such a large cast, but such a well placed cast. There was no one character that stuck out in a bad way, but in return there were several small parts that had a large impact. It is very important with movies that have a large cast that the characters are able to perform well beside each other, in THE BELKO EXPERIMENT they were able to do just that. As the movie progressed you saw how dynamic the actors could be. Small and large roles showed a broad array of emotions from sadness, anger, happiness, and fear as it was placed throughout. The other parts of the movie that were good was the ending. The resolution to the film did exactly that, it resolved the film. The end of the movie was able to create a setting that was so remarkably different from the other parts in the film that it really took a hold of you and didn't let you go. Till the last second.CONS: The frustrating part here in this movie was the placement of the cast. With a large cast you normally get stuck with what is happening with the other characters in the setting. I was very confused with where things were happening in space and time relation to other things in this filmwww.chorror.com"

" Absolutely awful with too many flaws to count
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,1,"This movie didn't do anything right.It starts out with pointless boring introductions of characters by showing them talk about random things; a good movie would have jumped right into the opening conflict.The protagonist is one of the worst characters in the movie, and therefore the viewer has no vested interest to see him survive. The villain and his methods are completely unbelievable, and the existence of said villain is just to try and add some drama to the movie, but it actually makes it worse than if the movie tried to be realistic in dealing with the situation.There's nothing new, interesting, or creative about the movie, because of the forced chaos by the writers. The movie would have been ten times more interesting, if the characters were rational, it had a slower pace, and the movie had focused on the choices people make to determine the best ethics for who should live or die. They almost had a moment like that, but then ruined it by having the villain start to randomly choose people for no reason.The ending was absurd, because apparently trained, armed guards are not capable of drawing a weapon on someone who tries to lunge free of those restraining them."
" Fun, Brisk Watch
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,6,"An entertaining, though wholly predictable, kill-fest that unfortunately has nothing to say, despite being found out to be a nefarious social experiment. If they had slacked on casting, it wouldn't be worth a brain cell, but luckily the list of sorta-recognizable, mostly under-the-radar actors they pit against each other make it a fun, brisk watch."
" Stomach Churning!
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,5,"I don't know where to begin on my thoughts of this movie. First I will say it is a very interesting/crazy concept for a movie and once this thing got going, it got out of hand quickly! You can't help but put yourself into the employees mind and trying to figure out what you would do if you were faced with certain death if you do not kill others.Obviously this movie isn't perfect, there are some plot holes. But my biggest gripe is that the screen writer took the easy way out and had a large armory of guns available to the participants in the ""social experiment"". It would have been much better and a lot more wild if there was only office supplies available and not the used of so many guns."
" Poor Belko
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,6,"I do wonder if there are any Belkos out there who may be offended that their name is being used for such a horrid experiment. Unless they are horrible people and like that notion. Dogs and other animals are not included in that comparison of course. But let's get back to the movie, that may generate some repulsion and/or interest for what it depicts and what it tells us about ""humanity"".Although you may argue it's more about Survival Instincts rather than any other human trait, there will be people who dare to show us there is more to things than just pure fighting. One thing I kind of missed was the humor. It was there at the beginning but it got away during the course of the movie. Which is even worse when you think that James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) was responsible for the script ... but that's just the way it is. Maybe it would have gotten in the way of the drama of the movie. It's a powerful movie and it does what it set out to do mostly. Entertaining and suspense ..."

" The love child of Battle Royale
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,8,"Ever seen the film Battle Royale? Well if you've seen The Belko Experiment then you really don't need to, the premise is practically the same. Nevertheless entertaining, it's still a poor man's rip-off, a group of American office workers have shipped out to Colombia and are working in the outskirts of the nations capital, Bogota, working for a highly important company called Belko.Just another day at the office, nope, it would prove to be the last day alive for all but one of them.What I liked about The Belko Experiment is its intense examination of the human psychology, what would people do if they're trapped in a building they have no way of escaping from, and their only means of survival is to kill the other hostages?It shows realistic characteristics of a wide array of different people, there's the good-hearted innocence, those who refuse to kill and just want to hide, there's the intellectuals good under pressure who'll try to work out a different way of escaping, thinking outside the box as it may, then of course there are societies cold-hearted bad guys, those willing to kill and follow the mysterious orders to guarantee their own survival. The fact that the film's genuine protagonist, Mike Milch (John Gallagher Jr) ends up being the sole survivor is satisfying, the one actual guy you were rooting for comes up trumps.The ending twist was clever and crafty, what on earth those guys were doing this experiment for is still a mystery to me, but the way Mike handled himself and took out the whole squadron with the miniature bombs he came into possession of is rather smart. Sickening and not to some tastes, avoid watching this film if you are of a nervous disposition or aren't keen on extreme violence, it can get disturbing and rather tense."

" The ending n lack of character development ruined an otherwise decent thriller.
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,7,"Three things made me c this film, the trailer, Michael rooker n the director of Wolf creek. The directors's last film starring Kevin Bacon, The Darkness was awful though. 1st- What they showed in the trailer was indeed satisfying when i saw the film. People are killed off with a bullet to the head, skulls n brains exploding, getting mangled in an elevator shaft, burning alive, stabbings, brutal smashing of face with axe. 2nd- Michael Rooker's role was very short. Got disappointed. 3rd- Knowin that its from the director of Wolf creek, i had hopes that the ending will b good but alas the whole film got ruined coz of the bad ending. Also the characters were not developed well. Audiences may not care who lives or dies. Two good things about this film, one- the order of the deaths were not predictable n it wasn't easy to guess who will survive. Ther is also one very brutal n innovative death showing a dent in the skull. Of course one may find shades of Battle Royale, The Hunger Games, Steve Austin's The Condemned, Stanford prison exp, Saw, etc. The scene wher they r made to filter out who to kill n who to spare was frightening n reminded me of the scene from Exorcist The Beginning wher the priest is made to choose whom to kill."

",2017-07-13 00:00:00,9,"Sure something like this has been done before, and how many different ways can it be portrayed, but this one did have some key differences. The pace was a little slow 3/4 of the way, as were some of the characters, but the last quarter of the film seemed to pick up the pace with the best parts coming together beautifully right at the end. It was well written and the cinematography on point. It's a 9/10 form me!"

Sorry.) or wish they could do anything they wanted to at work to whomever they wanted to The Belko Experiment may clear some of that up for you.This is a survival of the fittest types scenario that shows how adversity can bring out the best or in this case mostly the worst in the people you spend hours on end with day in and day out. While the story may seem basic at times it address's some very interesting scenario's(right to live based on age gender or amount of offspring you created) and is quite suspenseful leading up to it's conclusion. You will be playing favorites as to who you want to live or get wasted in this one and I won't spoil with personal preferences as I thought a movie like this would end with no survivors or witness's and was surprised.

" Bringing the world together
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,7,"Belko is a non-profit organization on the outskirts of Bogota, Columbia. It's stated goal is to find jobs for Americans in Columbia...or something like that. The building is huge and built like Fort Knox in case of terrorism. We find out during a new employee orientation they all have a GPS implant in case they are kidnapped, This sets the stage as we get to meet some of the characters, many we are familiar with from other films such as Michael Rooker from ""Guardians of the Galaxy""...and in fact it pretty much robs that production of it's less expensive talent. There is Rusty Schwimmer, who we have all seen in something that we can't remember. It was that kind film where we play ""I think he was in...."" Eighty people get locked in the building and are told to kill 2 people or suffer the consequences. When no one is killed, four people die from the exploding implants. Now they ask for 30 people to be killed or 60 will die...they got 2 hours which occupies much of the film.We have all seen similar films where people are forced to do something against their will and best moral judgment in order to survive or prevent a loved one from dying. This really wasn't much different except they hired more people to make the feature which didn't make it any better. There was no 'Saw"" character or any nefarious character in clown make-up. I think they could have made the group a little more diverse. Add a few ex-gang brothers, a guy in a wheel chair, ex-stripper, John Goodman..instead it was fairy white bread, a couple of stoners, ex-military, and office types. All with a 60's sound track in Spanish...Good Tijuana flashback.My favorite character got killed early, about the first to die, and I failed to root for anybody else. It was like turning on 'The Walking Dead"" and watching Daryl Dixon get eaten by a zombie in the first ten minutes.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
" Enjoyable but not exactly what I expected
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,7,"I'll try not to have any major spoilers but I clicked the spoiler check box just to be safe.Overall, I expected to like this movie and be entertained. I'm usually not for mindless violence, but the office setting and the psychological ""experiment"" of it all peaked my interest. In that regard, I was entertained and the movie was under 1.5 hours, so it didn't overstay its welcome. The set up and quick (but effective) character introductions were nicely done. I was expecting to see death by stapler, scissors, projectors, and random office gear; everyday, white collar people pushed to murder. And that's where my disappointment began. Guns are introduced into the equation relatively early (and not the ""everybody get a gun like House on Haunted Hill"" scenario), so death-by-telephone receiver, etc was unnecessary for the most part. And once the dying starts, there are characters/actors that I would have like to have seen more of. Also there are parts where the deaths are supposed to be random, and of course our ""heroes,"" who we've followed the most are spared that sudden fate for the most part.The introduction of guns leads to an execution scene, that frankly, I didn't enjoy. I wanted to see office workers forming cliques and chasing each other with creative weapons made from everyday office equipment. Lining them up and killing them was hard to stomach at parts, but the actors do a good job of portraying the internal struggle of the actions.Luckily it doesn't last long but the final climax becomes more predictable. The every-man-for-himself mentality is more good vs evil. In that regard, I believe the ""experiment"" portion failed. Few characters ever change. The pragmatic and ""bad"" are pitted against the lawful good and those with consciences. Few people are betrayed or switch sides for self preservation. In the end if felt more like US VS THEM, or a Class War more than everyone for themselves.All said and done, it was a good movie with great acting considering the semi-ridiculous plot but it pulls you in. But you always know who to root for, even if you are expecting a few twists that never really come."

The tracking devices are made to explode.The Belko Experiment is not unlike disaster films, in which a certain number of people are locked inside a building or a ship. The viewers become familiar with the characters. We get attached to some of them and hope they will survive. The questions are: Who will survive and who will not survive? Who keep a cool head and who become desperate? These questions also apply to this movie.Moreover, in such crisis situations, self-appointed and wise leaders, who are good at improvising, emerge. The less wise lose their lives because of heedlessness.You may very well look upon ""The Belko Experiment"" as an adult version of ""Lord of the Flies"", William Golding's novel about school boys marooned on a remote island. They are eventually divided into two groups. The members of one group , led by Ralph, want to remain civilized. The members of the other group, led by Jack, degenerate into savagery.The employees of ""The Belko Experiment"" are also divided into such groups. The Ralph character in this film is Mike Milch, while the Jack character is Belco's chief operating officer Barry Norris. Eventually the differences between the two groups are wiped out. The ""civilized"" also kill, but in self-defense.Such an experiment has never taken place in reality, and it is impossible to know if the film is credible or not. I longed for a psychological explanation of why the different employees chose the way they did. The screen writer has probably no talent for psychology.It was expected that the impudent Wendell Dukes, who didn't take a no for an answer from a female workmate, should end up in the ""wrong"" group. However, it would have been more effective if he to everyone's surprise had landed on the ""right"" side, to prove that there could be something good in such men as well.Screen writer James Gunn, with two films about ""Scoobi Doo"" on his list, is no William Golding. Gunn will never be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, as was the case with Golding.The boys in ""Lord of the Flies"" drop into savagery after staying on the island for several weeks or months. In ""The Belko Experiment"" it happens after a very short time. Yes, I really wonder how likely it is.Eventually, the film turns out to be a big murder spree. Clenched skulls and blood drooling from mouths eventually become common. Barry and his group don't just shoot people, they chop them with axes too. In fact, I feel that the idea of an experiment really was used as a pretext to give the viewers one and a half hour of killing.Who did I like best? Yes, most charming was the Laurel and Hardy-like couple Marty Espenscheid and Chet Valincou."
" Good Movie Bad Ending
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,4,"We all know the story so wont get into that.the point that i will like to make here is the why of it all.there are a lot of things going in the start and in the middle and i am OK with it(apart from the fact that 2 henchmen of CEO turn to mindless heartless mercenaries in a blink of an eye without any character work)... as i believe there will be a bigger purpose of this madness and i will be in awe of the plot twist or the story telling of the director. but the ending was the biggest down for me and it dragged the whole movie down. rather than giving a twist or certain closure they gave a silly master mind that appears for 4 to 5 mins saying some of the most stupidest dialogues and his sidekicks who cheesily put pencils on their lips and appear to observe that's it.Had it been done better the movie would have been rated at least 3 stars more than it is rated now in my opinion the ending should have justified the hour long killing spree, but no perspective was provided ... so disappointed"
" Never Reaches Its Full Potential
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,5,"There just isn't enough substance and while it fun to see the more seasoned actors play in the sandbox, it never amounts to enough to be very interesting. This is the kind of movie was probably funner to make than watch. There are other movies out there like Battle Royale that do this premise better justice."
" Office Space Available
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,8,"""It's 'I just SAW the MAZE RUNNER in THE OFFICE's CUBE'cle!'"" should be the tagline. And yet, it still works on its own.Oh, and throw in THE CABIN IN THE WOODS. I just couldn't fit this additional reference in there properly. It would be rather long, no?From the second I heard of this movie I wanted to see it. Some people like ghost/haunted house stories. *I* like real-life, or solid killer films. Something that could really happen or at least closer than some mystical ghost that has zero limits. So, yeah, this is MY type of horror.Basically, an office in the middle of Nowhere, World, is shut down for an ""Experiment"" to see who can kill or will kill to save themselves. Of course, at first, these desk-jobbers think it's a farce, but then some drop like flies. It's ON then. Who will survive this closed-in massacre to prove their humanity? I guess that's the goal.I've worked in the Dilbert-industry with all the tropes this movie portrays for the past 20+ years. Sadly, people put under extreme pressure for self-preservation might resort to murder, though it's hard to see it really happening. And that's probably the point. It most likely would truly pan out this way, despite us thinking it could never happen.If you like real-life horror stories, government conspiracies in a fictional sense and non-spiritual mumbo-jumbo, this is right up your cubical alley. ***Final thoughts: Just ask yourself, what would you do? Are you capable of erasing your morals and do what's right to save yourself or more lives?"

" Battle Royal in an office block
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,6,"so the comparison to battle royal is obvious, it's the same idea, but in an office. the script, acting, story and execution is pretty bad. But, if you like Battle Royal and the idea of friends and colleagues having to kill each other off as the time runs out then you can't go far wrong with this. I still don't get why the 1st task was to kill 30 people and the second task kill everyone else, doesn't seem any reason to separate the tasks but for it making a longer movie. Enjoyable, but very average and a movie without a single original thought in it."
" A total Yawner, thanks for nothing James Gunn
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,1,"First I wouldn't write any spoilers, because this movie is like rotten meat - spoiled right away. Just a garbage, go nowhere, do nothing movie. Did James Gunn get high while watching the far, far superior Battle Royale? Did his success with Guardians of the Galaxy (two isn't better than one) go to his head? Whatever happened resulted in this stupid, senseless, poorly executed watered down version of Battle Royale. There are so many plot holes in this wretched film as to make it nearly unwatchable. It's barely above the level of the SyFy channels lame Asylum movies. And those are totally terrible. Most of the actors seems to be sleep walking through the movie and those that try shouldn't have wasted their time. This is just another movie that shows why Hollywood has no balls - even when they rip off a better movie, they do it poorly. I wish I could sue the studio so I could get back the time of my life I wasted watching this GARBAGE."
" Kind of Goofy, But Watchable
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,6,"This movie was sort of a re-hash / re-telling of several ""Experiment"" films I've seen over the past several years. Kind of like where they get people together in prisons and let half of them be the guards and the rest prisoners, etc. It works to show man's inhumanity to man - and that's something we all know exists - but the premise is always a little bit on the silly side because there's no way to suspend disbelief enough to assume anybody would care one way or the other. The ending of this one separates it just a bit from the pack. Not what you'd expect...without giving it away or putting in spoilers. Sadly, there aren't many good movies coming out of Hollywood lately thanks to Amazon and Netflix, so this is about as good as you're going to get."
" Belko are culling their staff literally!
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,7,"Written by James Gunn, director of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, and directed by Greg McClean, of Wolf Creek fame, The Belko Experiment is far from wholly original, being a little bit Saw, a little bit Cube, and a little bit Battle Royale. But despite the familiarity of the set-up, the film still manages to be a whole lot of fun thanks to a rollicking pace and its unrelenting violence, McClean and Gunn wasting little time in getting to the splattery action, which keeps on going right to the very end.The film takes place in the high security headquarters of Belko International, in Bogotá, Colombia, where the American employees are locked in and informed by a mysterious voice on the intercom that they must participate in a fight to the death. At first, the employees think it is a sick prank, but when several of the tracking devices implanted in each person's head suddenly explode, they realise that the person on the microphone is deadly serious.What follows is a gory game of survival, the employees dividing into two groups, those who are unwilling to comply, and those who intend to make it through alive, whatever it takes. As the guinea pigs of this twisted human experiment battle it out, viewers are treated to several well staged scenes of suspense and action, and plenty of blood and guts, more than enough mayhem to keep most gore-hounds happy for the duration."
" A good yarn
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,7,"As Indie movies go this is pretty good. No it's not an idea that is new but the execution of it is solid and competent. You keep watching and that is the number one thing in movies in my opinion. It's a story of a kind of Utopian office block that is used in an experiment to study human nature. But it satisfies so many genres, sci-fi in a mild sense, slasher fans, psychological intrigue. It's interesting really, because although people will see it as a bit far fetched, I actually think that in the same circumstances humans wouldn't react that much differently since a higher archy, whatever the make up, tends to dictate what should happen, or want to happen...although, at the end of the day, we all hope it wouldn't be the case. Having said all this the movie doesn't take itself too seriously and yet keeps an edge and has some surprising outcomes that you don't really expect.The cast is very good, everyone plays the game and although I'm sure all of them kind of knew what they were getting into, play their roles with enough sincerity to make it worthwhile.All in all a great effort and a couple of hours of good entertainment. We have all been in a 'grind your balls out' office to make a living and I think they did enough at the beginning, in a limited sense, to portray that and engage an audience."
" Not your typical ""mice in a box"" movie
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,8,"Much as I like the entertaining factor in a movie, I also respect the reality touch. This is not like one of the many movies where you put people in an enclosed space and ""may the best subject survive"" plots take place. Yes this is the premise, but executed in a little different way. As I watched the movie I felt a bit uncomfortable with the characters' choices, after it ended I felt a little down on the blockbuster effect, but two days later and I still can't get this movie out of my head. Now while this certainly isn't a classic, it depicts how things would unravel were this to really happen. Bottom line - it feels very real. And gory in case anyone wonders."
" predictable premise; good gore; good ending
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,7,"The premise of this movie has been used in many other films I have seen - humans will kill to survive.The gore was good.I took away THREE STARS from this movie because the writers of this movie decided to let a COWARD win, and the STRONGEST lose. That defeats the premise of survival of the fittest.I mean if you're up by ~17, with only a few mins from winning it all, it'd make sense you'd just wait the clock out instead of going out and risk it all when you've already won.But the writers of this movie decided to be ******.The ending had a good twist that will satisfy most viewers.Good movie overall."
" Cheap mans battle royale
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,3,"One of the worst movies i've seen this year. The story is just ridiculous and the acting horrendous.A bunch of employees go to work on a normal day, only things take a turn for the worse and the soon find out the whole building is on shut down, and they have to kill each other to survive. The company has put microchips in all the employees, and use them to explode the people when they don't follow instructions ( sound familiar)The plot is really bad and the so called twist at the end is even worse. Its so predictable what's going to happen, and eventually they all die except the good guy, who happens to plant the explosives on all the culprits at the end and blow them all up. How would the explosive still work if it had already been detonated before???? how didn't they see this on the cameras, they were quite obviously dissecting people's heads getting these things out, didn't they wonder what was going on?It was really bad, don't waste your time on this movie, its not worth the time watching it."
" Loved Belko!
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,10,"Just bought this movie last night and already am watching for a second time. This movie paced nicely, the acting wasn't bad and the story kept my interest. I really liked everything about the movie the concept which is kill all your co workers, so that's exactly what happens, I also enjoyed that they fleshed out the characters the best they could even though some of them were only on camera for a minute or two. I really enjoyed the relationship between Mike and Leandra too! I think everyone should watch this movie, it's a quick One and a half hours, I don't think you will be disappointed."
" Blumhouse ruins another good premise. What a shame.
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,3,"When I read the synopsis of this film, I was excited. ""Battle Royale meets Office Space"". How can these two vastly different properties be unified into a proper film? Unfortunately, it can't. At least not with Blumhouse ruining everything that would have made it a classic. First, the movie isn't funny, clever or cute. Everyone is a jerk, and they all deserved to die. Let's just get that out of the way. Secondly, you would think that with it being set in an office, you would have gotten more inventive kills. Staplers, drowned in scalding coffee, taking the boss' prized golf club and teeing off someone's nose. Nothing so clever happens, and once they get a hold of the more ""traditional"" weapons, the movie devolves into another basic and limited ""every man for himself"" film. It's unfortunate that a movie with a decent script, good acting, and a great directorial style was hampered and ruined by Blumhouse. They just don't understand what makes a horror film successful. If anyone from Blumhouse is reading, please, please stop ruining the entire genre with your failed output. This is the last time I pay money to watch any of your films. I have just gotten burned way to many times. Pathetic."
" Too much focus on violence over psychology
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,7,"I'm a big fan of films that delve into the human psyche. They often deal with scenarios that we will simply never be able to actually witness in real life, and therefore are very interesting to watch in movie form. Most of these types of films are quite underground and never reach a very wide audience. 'The Belko Experiment' seems to be the exception, and has garnered quite an audience through cinematic releases. Interestingly, I think there are a lot of stronger ones out there, but they probably couldn't match the cast that this one has managed to sign on.I did like 'The Belko Experiment', but my problem with it lies in the structuring of the story. Too much of the focus is on violence and not enough on the actual situation these people are (or could be) in. There was a chance to be really creative and innovative with the scenarios these characters could be put in, but the film instead decides to keep the scenarios simple and just make sure that they make for a lot of violence. To me that's a disappointing way to go about it for two reasons. The first being that the psychology side of things make for a more entertaining film, and secondly because I feel like the writer should be smart enough to achieve both.The positives in this film lie in a very strong cast, playing some very strong characters (at least for this type of film). There are 80 people in the building the film is set in, and while we obviously don't meet anywhere near all of those, we still do meet a great number of them - and they're all very well created characters in their own way. For me 'The Belko Experiment' is a good film that could have been a great one."
" Old wine in new bottles
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,8,I can clearly see The Belko Experiment have been influenced a lot by Battle Royale a Japanese horror flick with a very similar tone and set up a group of people that know each other for a long time one day get throw in a deadly situation required them to killing each other for the sake of social experiment.Watching this movie you will know when someone about to die based on their personality when the movie tropes kinda obviously.Despite all that i still find my self enjoy the movie cause right from the start the movie know itself a B-style horror movie so it may sure to entertain audience with a ton of gory action and some very high tension scene that very satisfied in the end.My problem is although they introduce a lot of character but never go deep into their relationship or how their know how to do a lot of f**cked up stuff kinda annoy me for a bit.Nevertheless it still a awesome horror movie that i really want to see a sequel cause it left quite a big cliffhanger
" This is one of the dumbest movies I ever seen.
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,1,"It's so dumb, it's DUMBDUMB! I have to write three lines of text about this movie, so here it goes. I saw a bunch of good actors in this film, so that means the director FAILED in making this a good movie. I could have directed this film a thousand times better than the director of this film. Mainly because I love films. I realize that directors have a certain time to make a film, but this film is the reason why they should be given more time."
" Hypocritical and useless
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,4,"Let's get one thing out the way: this is horror for the masses, in the worst possible meaning of such definition. It's domesticated, neutered, lowest common denominator, watered down horror at its worst and, as such, is a bar lowerer for the whole genre.With that said, here's a list of adjectives and definitions that passed through my mind while I was watching this: unfocused, half-baked, hypocritical, unrealistic af, lame, predictable, stupid to the point of being downright offensive, heavy handed, useless. Mostly hypocritical (for what it tries to say about ""human nature"") and useless, anyway.The only positives are that is generally well acted (with a tragic waste of John C. McGinley) while featuring some beautiful shots (nothing to write home about, though) and it's not shy on gore (for a mainstream movie). These, along with some humor here and there, are the only reason why I'm giving it 4/10 instead of 1.The story has been done to death in countless other movies, novels, short stories, comic books, TV shows and video games (so, for the geniuses claiming this is a rip-off of danganronpa: yeah, no. That game is as much as rip off of other, better things, than this is). If you want some examples of movies that do the same kind of storyline, only way better than this: ""Cube"" (1997), ""The Experiment"" (both the German original, 2001 and the American remake, 2010), ""The Mist"" (2007) or any adaptation of ""Lord of the Flies"", really."
" Surprisignly enjoyed this film
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,9,"I had low expectations going into this film as I happened upon it from an advertisement on Facebook and that was all I had heard about it. The main character, Mike, is honestly not that likable in the beginning of the movie but his character development is actually a good parallel to the entire plot of this movie. Basically, if you are interested in psychology and like blood and guts movies, then you will enjoy this movie. It is an interesting look into the cognitive dissonance of modern humans. Everyone says they would never do something to harm someone but this is an interesting look into the vestigial instincts of the human psyche. Would recommend it and I hope they make another. Do not watch it for the entertainment value, rather for the reflective nature of the movie."
" Non-attractive confusion
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,2,"Fist of all, I don't consider this a horror movie. It really doesn't contain those building blocks of a proper horror. It is not even a thrilling thriller. Just a big mass i could not put together. In my opinion, just a producers bad try to use psychology to rise a popularity. Some scenes I found ridiculous and I actually laughed at. Gore and blood is one of the reasons i didn't vote ""awful"". There are grouse moments but as nearly enough to call this at least a good thriller (this movie just cant be a horror). The only frightening scene was the bare ending and that is all! Simply saying, a big miss in imitating a Shutter Island."
" Sad for it being just average
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,5,"After watching I do believe that ""The Belko Experiment"" would've been a much better film overall under the direction of James Gunn. I don't think Greg McLean does full justice to Gunn's script and the ""Experiment"" fell a bit short, at least for me. Its not a bad movie in any aspect but for me it lacked the extra detail and effort to make it something above average. The acting is just fine. Aside from the main character Mike - played by John Gallagher, Jr - who I found a bit cringy and sufferable to watch from time to time - everyone seems to know what they're doing - shoutout to Tony Goldwyn, Adria Ajorna and John C. McGinley who for me, where the best of the bunch. Another big positive for me was the soundtrack. I've grown quite fond of Tyler Bates since watching John Wick 2 and he excels once more at creating tension and urgency. With all of that said, ""The Belko Experiment"" was a bit of a let down - the major plot point was left incompletely unexplained and the sequel? teaser at the end didn't make it for me. They should've been more smart and inventive, otherwise we are only left with an hour and an half of gore just for gore's sake."
" Good corporate experiment to watch, not be partaking in
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,7,"My quick rating - 6,5/10. In a somewhat unique take on the kill or be killed scenario via ""Battle Royale"", this movie more so focuses on the psychology of how those in a corporate environment will react. The individual characters do help somewhat in keeping the tension going, although I think they could have done a lot more in defining each more. For the most part, it was acted out well, including Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley), OK shameless ""Scrubs"" plug on that one. To see how they respond to the situation is of course where all the tension lies, and don't worry, it does get pretty brutal. I could not help but think of the experiment being much like ""The Experiment"" which was a criminally unheard of movie that was done just as well, only with prisoners and guards. And not to the death, and voluntary. OK, I guess it really was nothing like this movie now that I typed that out, but the whole social experiment part and how it was acted had that feel. I think with a bit more polish and some better character development, this could've really stood out, but as it is, still a good watch."
" Average Movie With Poor Special Effects
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,5,"It is 2016 and visual effects in this movie are poor. Unrealistic. And that is not the main problem. The main problem is a leading character. His acting is OK, not bad, but could they not find someone more realistic. This guy appearance is like he is some kind of teenager and not a worker in a big company.I watched this because I didn't have better things to do, but I regret it now. But if you love blood, simple acting and mediocre scenario then you may like this more than I did."
" Not worth waste of time
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,2,This movie was not the best one ever. It's a mix between the German movie ''Das experiment'' and final destination. They took the gory and remove the story. The movie is all about people killing because they are told to after a few head explode. Survival of the fittest maybe... but just a reason to make a movie with death inside.
" Piece of crap, very violent without any suspense
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,1,"Don't bother watching this visually disturbing piece of crap movie. Very violent graphics. Ordinary story line. Supposedly a sequel for this planned!! so, would advise not wasting your time over this, better watch something else! To give you a hint on the story line, people are locked in an office and go on a rampage killing each other."
" 1 out of 10 is too much!
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,1,"I don't usually let reviews over here but man... this is one of the most idiotic movies I've ever seen. Budget $5 million? Five? Five Million Dollars? For what? For 5 tons of ketchup? There are millions of ideas to make a movie with less than $5 million dollars and actually good. I'm very sorry to say that but again... this is the most stupid movie I've seen so far. And I have one question: who the hell does this even if it's a real situation?! No man... I cannot give a better rating. Even 1 is too much. Sorry, but it's awful."
" Review - The Belko Experiment [+42%]
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,4,"James Gunn's return to horror territory intrigues at first but things start to get predictable as they progress. Australian director Greg McLean has always been a splatter director churning out mediocre flicks (with some nicely choreographed kills, but lacking memorable characters) that laid emphasis more on the antagonist. While 'The Belko Experiment' is more a straightforward gore-fest than 'Rogue' or 'Wolf Creek' or 'Wolf Creek 2', this flick even lacks the conviction that made McLean's previous films engrossing i.e. placing characters in seemingly terrifying/disturbing environments and fighting for their survival. The setting is downright absurd, the premise appears to be wacky on paper (could work better as a page-turning novel than film!). What makes 'The Belko Experiment' a passable flick is the frequent splash of wry humour which works in parts owing to the milieu. The horror is purely restricted to gore and kills. It is not one bit atmospheric. Watch when you've run out of options! 4/10"
" The Belko Experiment (2017)
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,6,"When I first saw the trailer for this my exact reaction was: ""Wait, is this really a film?"" It seemed like a gore film horror commercial about the workplace. When I learned that it was indeed a real film I was quite interested to check it out. It looked like The Office meets Battle Royale and in many ways that turned out to be an apt comparison. This film is actually kind of original as I can't kind of think of something like this off the top of my head. Its not bad, but its really just mindless violence that still could have been more fun.The film takes place at a remote Belko Industries building in Colombia. Everything seems to point towards a regular day at work until a loud announcement comes over the speaker. Two of the workers in the building must be killed, or an increased number of workers will be killed at random. As the game goes along the number and violence increases. The workers all have trackers in their head (how did they agree to this?) that blow up when the experimenters see fit. Pacts and groups are created and random acts of violence are seen throughout and the employees must figure out a way to stay alive in this horrid atmosphere.This film has a few familiar faces but not anyone overly popular. I like films that take place in an office setting but haven't really experienced one that takes place within the confines of crazy, gory violence. I welcomed that idea. The problem was none of the cast is really that memorable and seem to just act without any great development. Another thing I expected from the trailer and premise, was for this to be a black comedy with plenty of humor throughout all the violent themes. That is not the case, and I think that hurts the film from being truly memorable.There's plenty of gore and violence but you can't really sit back and enjoy anything because of the lack of humor or lack of characterization. I do like the idea but it could have used more craft. All in all I'm not that critical about this because its a throwaway gory film which serves its purpose, and I can't be mad at that because I'm not expecting something perfect with this subject matter.6.5/10"

Acting well the best ones were John C. McGinley and Tony Goldwyn, they were filled with energy and power. Directing was good in showing too many blood scenes.

" A short review of ""The Belko Experiment"" (2016)
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,8,"""The Belko Experiment"" (2016) is a fairly gut-wrenching and potent horror film. I was going to describe it as ""Battle Royale"" (2000) meets ""The Office"" (2005 – 2013). But, from the looks of the poster, somebody more or less beat me to it.As you can imagine, there is a sequence of blood-curdling events after the workers of an entire office building are forced to fight one another to the death. It's made all the more horrifying (and a bit sad) by a surprisingly effective early montage that shows these people are indeed likable and relatable.I'm not sure how I feel about the ending. There's a twist that is nicely satisfying, I'll grant the movie that. But there was far too little exposition, and a closing shot that was a little too ambiguous and open-ended  maybe even abstract. I'd be happier if the person doing the talking told us a lot more. If you think about it, they mostly just reiterated what various characters had hypothesized earlier.This film has a couple of ""I swear I know that guy"" actors. These include Tony Goldwyn, who I last remember from 1990's ""Ghost."" Turns out he's a damn fine actor (in addition to being one of those people who weirdly appear to age little or not at all). They also include John C. McGinley, Owain Yeoman and Michael Rooker. And if you think you can recall the gentle giant played by Abraham Benrubi, the actor is none other than ""Big Mike"" from the classic ""The X- Files"" episode, ""Arcadia.""I was going to rate ""The Belko Experiment"" a 9 out of 10; it was exceptionally good. But I was just too nonplussed by that rushed ending, and I think I'll settle on an 8."
" A flawed but pleasingly brutal take on a familiar story
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,6,"In this grisly horror film, 80 company employees trapped in an office block play a horrifying game of 'kill or be killed'. This premise is familiar, but oh boy is it always entertaining. This one carries out the premise with mixed results. In terms of direction, there aren't many complaints. This is a tense, suspenseful and visceral thrill ride with many scenes of fear and terrifying brutality. As well as this, for a horror film the acting is actually really good. The first half of the film is fabulous. There's tension, thought-provoking moral questions and the violence genuinely affects you. It becomes more than just a bit of fun and actually really makes you think. In that case, this film does its job too well. Eventually, with its excessive gore and every likable character endlessly dying, it does become highly unpleasant. This is arguably in a good way, but it is just a bit too much and after a while it stops being scary and starts being exhausting. The final half an hour, though effective, is just a bit much. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite fulfill the promise of the trailers and the first half. Still, as modern horror films go it's very solid and despite the superficial exploration of morals and ethics, it may get nasty but it never stops being effective. Give this one a look if it's your thing. If you don't like blood, stay far away. 6/10"
" Just another day at the office!?
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,5,"This is a horror thriller featuring a respectable cast. The BELKO Experiment is an interesting film about the human nature, and how characters (you think you might know) can change when their lives are threatened or put into jeopardy. BELKO is a hi-tech company with offices all over the world, the film starts as 'just another day at the office' but quickly progresses to a kill or be killed randomly thriller.Steel shields snap down over all the office glass windows and the staff are instructed by a mysterious voice over the tannoy to kill 30 colleagues in the next two hours or 60 will die randomly, the voice explains the rules which the staff must adhere to in order to survive.So the game is simple, kill your colleagues and which-ever single individual is left at the end of the day is free to leave! The ensuing violence is relentless and very brutal.Initially the story building is very inventive but when the violence starts feels more like a low budget film! Not intentionally funny enough to be a comedy but not clever enough to be a social study either. However, this film is about office politics taken to an extreme and makes you wonder what you would do in their circumstances, and is different enough to be a guilty pleasure."
" Battle Royale in an office, meh.
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,6,"This review of The Belo Experiment is spoiler free*** (3/5)BEFORE HE CLEANED his writing for the family-friendly blockbuster Guardians of the Galaxy (both volumes), writer-director James Gunn conducted the script to The Belko Experiment. A horror slasher/whodunit thriller. Both forming the two sides of Gunn, however before he had blockbusting scripture he was known as a horror writer, writing and directing the dark, Slither, and the uncompromisingly silly Super. This perhaps brought influence to Zack Snyder for Watchmen. For this Gunn left the directing to Wolf Creek's Greg McLean, making this a winning combination between writer and director and for a while at least it succeeds.Plot wise, it's The Hunger Games franchise meets The Purge, happily there are few things this has in common with them, merciless rules, a time limit to kill and intriguing characterization. Not only does the company but also the title of the film itself screams government, a huge of security, a locked gate and a tall building a mile from civilization. There's a menacing company boss (Tony Goldwyn), who will do anything to keep his workers calm but when it comes to it he sacrifices others. And just on the outside in an abandoned hanger there is a team of tight-knit killers who have clever gadgets, with buttons and names of the employees and an unknown voice announcing a game of kill or be killed, the most satisfying part; there a whole bunch of people that are killed from micro chipped bombs. Theoretically the exploding head technique works for a while, it's stunning to look at (in a merciless way) but after a while it becomes monotonous, painting rooms with blood and skull remnants all over the floor. There are changes in the killing strategy that come slightly too late though in some cases later is better, here that works when players are used as cannon fodder, perhaps leading the film to a predictable end but it's thrilling all the same. On the other hand Gunn is a wonderful writer, his screenplay is clever, has some silly moments but that's what made his blockbuster good, because it had silly moments. There is a bunch of that here, while for most of the time it stays mostly serious, implementing a balanced screenplay. Even though practically everything you see here has been done before, the merciless killings and the player panic The Belko Experiment is a surprisingly enjoyable thriller with a lot of polished cred (the writer and the director), the style and the solid performances.VERDICT: A brutally, bloody Battle Royale that gives tension, style and a lot of cred. That glides along nicely through, until a disappointing dip in the second half. Still, there are plenty of positive points, the brutal violence, the polished style and the solid performances to enjoy."
" Good Film
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,8,"This film was great from start to finish there was never one boring moment throughout the film.The experiment altogether was very interesting it reminded a lot like the Saw series with the ""if you don't do this in time you will die"" type of thing. The characters were all likable and the kills were well done and there were moments when I was just shocked at how messed up they were and I have seen a lot of horror movies with messed up deaths but one I won't say took the cake.Overall it's a very good film there is a couple of flaws but if you ignore them you get a intense and well made films if you like the idea you saw in the Saw series then this is a film for you."
" Bloody, Intensely Teriffying good movie
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,10,"I have to say I didn't know what to expect walking into this movie, having not seen a trailer nor read too much into it. What I found was an amazing thrill ride of a movie! One of the only movies that I've sat in my seat with my mouth open most of the time. It was extremely intense and satisfying. The movie was very brutal and gory but under the circumstances I can't criticize that too much. The plot was very different from anything that I've seen before and it intrigued me, what would you do if you got into a situation like this? I like the setting of the office building as well, it made the movie more suspenseful. In the end, you find out that there was more than one Belko experiment and that it's happening all over the world in different countries. You will leave this movie feeling disturbed, but also satisfied. It will also remind you a little bit of the movie Saw, but 10 times more brutal."
" Danganronpa except bad
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,2,"Literally just a live action Danganronpa but with less interesting characters and zero pay off....... Honestly if you want to see this except good play the danganronpa series? I just honestly don't know how to feel about how similar they are....? I just... Jesus.Danganronpa is a video game series in which 16 high school students are trapped inside the school and are forced to murder one another under the threat that more will die if they should not. The last person standing is allowed to go free.This movie is just... exactly Danganronpa??????? except with really.... really unlikable characters in an office building.Spoiler belowThe ending makes a poor attempt at payoff by hinting at a possible sequel but likely it's just a ""deep"" ending that will produce no further movies. The final man standing emerges from the building, only for the scene to pan out to be another screen in the middle of many more screens depicting more people emerging from their own experiment buildings."
" Disappointing, Even for a Genre Fan
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,3,"If you've seen the trailer for this film, or even the just the poster, you pretty much know all you need to know about this film. A bunch of office employees are mysteriously locked within their office building and told they have to kill each other or they'll all die. If you've seen one of these movies like Circle, Nine Dead, Panic Button, Are You Scared, The Human Race, Vile, Breathing Room, etc, you've seen them all. And none of them are very good.The promotion of this film makes it look a little more fun. It's set in a very stuffy, cubicle-based work environment with a few recognizable character actors, including John McGinley and Michael Rooker. Like setting The Hunger Games in Office Space. But any reports that this has a lot of wit or cleverness give this film way too much credit. The humor is sparse and unfunny when it arrives. This film's biggest running gag is pretty much a stoner character who insists everything going on is one big chemical trip. Hope you think that idea's hilarious, because they go back to that well over and over throughout the whole film. But really, this film doesn't so much fail to be funny as neglect to try. The stoner doesn't get much screen time, and one liners are few and far between. This is mostly just a grim and nihilistic catalog of violence.And hey, that's not necessarily a bad thing. I like grim and nihilistic films, and some of my favorites are super violent. I loved the Lawnmower scene in Dead/Alive, or the geyser of blood that Johnny Depp became in Nightmare On Elm St. But even if you're just a gore-hound looking for a bunch of cool kills, you're going to be disappointed. Going in, I was expecting to see lots of amusing office-themed kills. You know, like a kid from the mail room is forced to make a stapler lethal or a secretary takes out three mean executives at once with a coffee maker. But nope. For whatever stupid reason, it's established early on that this building has a weapons cache, full of handguns. So almost everybody just shoots at each other. I mean, yeah they get knives from the kitchen and fire axes, and there are a few different kills. But none are particularly cool, new or office-themed.And there's also a whole ton of characters. This movie aims to deliver a super high body count. That might sound promising too, but this means almost nobody is fleshed out or interesting. As late as the last six or seven minutes, random office people were getting killed before we even learned who they were. Even the leads are thinly, barely developed characters you'll never care about.The premise, as always, is dumb. We're meant to believe things like all the employees let the company implant chips in the back of their heads and never thought to question why. Characters go from normal to psycho super fast, just because the movie doesn't have time to develop the real emotional responses the characters would go through. And in this particular case, I also don't think the filmmakers cared, which is odd, because asking ""what would I do in that situation"" and connecting or disagreeing with the differing characters is kind of these movies' biggest draw. But here, people are established immediately as just good or bad guys and then spend the movie behaving exactly as you knew they would.Then I guess a big point to these movies is the big ""why"" reveal at the end, right? Well I won't post any spoilers; don't worry. But let's just say it's one of the most rushed, poorly thought out revelations I've seen in this little sub-genre. It makes me think maybe this movie never intended to reveal what was behind it all, but test audience response forced them to tack on a quick meaningless little coda.But before I end this, what are the positives? Well, 1) a couple of the performances are poor and generic, but actually most of the cast acquitted themselves fairly well. Most of them deserved to be in a better movie with more interesting material. And, 2) the film does at least make good on its fundamental promise. This isn't like a monster movie where the monster doesn't show up to kill anybody until the last five minutes. Most of the running time is devoted to office employees running around the building killing each other. We weren't lied to by the marketing; they gave us what they sold us. And finally, 3) this film has a decent budget. So many films like this feel super cheap and take place in one room because they were clearly working backwards from ""we can only afford to make a movie in one location."" This one looks like it had money to throw around. Money they might not make back, but hey that's their look out, not ours."
" It will leave you thinking about it for years to come!
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,9,"'THE BELKO EXPERIMENT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new indie horror flick from director Greg McLean and writer James Gunn (who also co-produced the film). McLean is previously known for helming both 'WOLF CREEK' movies, and the killer crocodile flick 'ROGUE', and Gunn is obviously famous for co-scripting and directing the 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY' blockbusters, as well as writing and directing the indie horror and superhero flicks 'SLITHER' and 'SUPER' (also for co-writing the cult classic 'TROMEO AND JULIET'). This movie tells the story of a bunch of office employees, that are forced to play a sadistic game where they have to kill each other, or be killed. It stars John Gallagher Jr., Adria Arjona, Tony Goldwyn, John C. McGinley, Melonie Diaz and Michael Rooker (a regular cast member of Gunn's) . The film was made on a budget of just $5 million, and it's already grossed nearly twice that, but it's also only gotten mixed reviews from critics. I loved it!The story begins with the staff of Belko Industries arriving to work, at their remote office building in Bogota, Columbia. New security guards are turning away all of the local Colombian employees at the gate. Mike Milch (Gallagher Jr.) is suspicious of what's going on right away, as his coworkers are more calm about it. Things go on as normal there, until a loud voice comes over the intercom ordering the employees to kill two of their coworkers, or more would be executed as a result. The COO of Belko (Goldwyn) tells everyone to remain calm, because it's probably just a prank, even as the entire building becomes sealed off (trapping all of the staff inside). When people start turning up dead, and they're ordered to kill even more, the Belko employees begin to snap and slowly turn on each other.Like all great horror/sci-fi films, the movie is full of great social commentary. It's about as disturbing a subject as you can find in cinema today, and that's what makes it so intense and involving. It was made on a budget of just $5 million, but McLean (like all of the most talented horror filmmakers today) knows how to make that money work. The movie is totally creative that way, and fresh. The story, and events in it, seem exaggerated, but I can totally see things turning out almost exactly the same way if it happened in reality. Films examining the dark side of humanity, with little to no hope in them, are usually the hardest to watch, but sometimes they're also the most rewarding. Gunn is also about as good of a writer as you could possibly find for a movie like this too, and the cast is all more than adequate as well (especially Gallagher Jr. in the lead). It's a near masterpiece, that will leave you thinking about it for years to come (like all great horror/sci-fi films do)!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/rLEEz_CHZwo"
" Very predictable and mildly entertaining
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,6,"Go watch the trailer. Then extrapolate what you think this movie will be like, and how it will end. There, you've seen it. I've saved you from having to watch the full movie.The movie is very predictable right to the end. I thought it could have been a lot better, especially the 2nd half - maybe they throw in a surprise, or vary it in some way - but, sadly, no.Just another mindless movie that the average mediocre person will enjoy, but true movie buffs will find predictable and lacking."
" My new favorite horror movie!!!
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,10,"I know a lot of people are talking negatively about this new horror film but I love it love it love it. I think it's got terrific acting, great horror, suspense, and gore. This movie reminded me a little bit of the Saw movies, but I still like it more. It felt so real seeing those people trapped in the building having to do war. Almost as if I was trapped in there, with a bomb in my head. Aside from the horror there are sad moments of this film. I don't know how I don't cry easily most of the time. But before the last 10 minutes there was a scene so depressing almost like a tear jerking film. But I'm definitely gonna buy this when it comes to blue ray. Of course you don't have to take mine or anyone's word. But I still say see it for yourself and if you don't like it, don't freak out. Opinions are never facts."
" Far more a gory slasher than it is a psychological drama
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,6,"""The Belko Experiment"" brings the story of Mike Milch and his co-workers at Belko Industries. As the movie opens, we are informed this is ""Bogota, Colombia"", as Mike arrives at work, surprised to see new security guards. We get to know a number of other Belko employees, including Leandra (Mike's girlfriend), as well as Dany, a brand new hire. Dany is asked whether she got her implant, a tracking device in all employees in case they are kidnapped. Then, out of the blue, steel shutters engulf the building and the PA informs the 80 employees that if they don't kill two employees (no matter who), more will die at random. At this point we're just over 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: the movie is directed by Australian horror-meister Greg McLean, but more importantly, it is written by James ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". Gunn's story has an interesting (but by no means unique) angle: what will people do when ordered to kill a few in order to save more lives? I knew going in that this was the starting premise, and (probably my fault/mistake) was under the impression that this movie was more of a psychological drama. Certainly the first half felt that way, but then the movie (take your pick) deteriorates/gets down to business, and becomes an outright slash-fest. From that point on, my interest in the movie tapered off, although I do give kudos to the interesting ending (mustn't spoil!). Couple of asides: no idea why this movie is set in Colombia, and no explanation given. Also, when we get intel on Belko, we're told it is a ""non-profit helping American companies hiring American employees in South America"". Does that sound like a non-profit to you? And the name Belko INDUSTRIES doesn't help... Last but not least, Tyles Bates contributes an interesting electronic score.""The Belko Industries"" opened a few weeks ago in a handful of theaters here in Greater Cincinnati. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (3 people, including myself), not that this means anything as such. Bottom line: if you are a fan of slasher-horror movies, by all means I encourage you to see this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."

Bloody-good horror film set with 80 Americans in Bogota, Colombia at a remote corporate office building suddenly under siege : an unknown voice over the speaker system informs them they are to kill off their co-workers if they want to survive this deadly game after they are sealed off from the outside world. James Gunn's pitch black comedy resonates as underpinnings to the body count at hand with some gruesome deaths and who can you trust paranoia via claustrophobia thanks to even handed direction by Greg McLean."
" A little bit too much, and exaggerated
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,7,"The Belco Experiment was a good film, but not very realistic. As a matter of fact, maybe it was aiming to be so darn real and powerful that it failed at just that. The gore of the movie was not too played out. Sure, every movie needs those bloody scenes. But some of the fight scenes could be better choreographed to create that stimulating effect. I thought the people, who were after killing the employees inside the building were okay, but they were not that scary. It was more like the movie was trying to make the killing spree build up, but it was nothing like that. At least it didn't feel that way. The more we saw the employees be killed the more annoying it became. It was like, who's gonna pick up after this ____? I also felt, in my own personal opinion, that they could have cast the protagonist as someone else. Sure, the chick was hot, but the guy needed to work on his looks. LOL. Sorry. At the end, when we realize the guy was in fact as crazy as all of those other people throughout the world, or Colombia, it's realistic. So he fought so much he finally ended up crazy. A madman."
" Fun at first, ultimately a waste of time...
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,6,"The set up for the movie had a somewhat interesting concept at its core: what do people do when they are trapped in a situation where the only way out is to kill others? Not a completely original idea, but it has some potential to be thought provoking if there is some kind of message it is trying to send, or some aspect of society it is trying to satirize. The resulting bloodbath is well executed, if you are into seeing office workers murder each other. I can't tell if the movie has a messed up sense of humor, or if a few people in the theater with me just thought some of the deaths were so ridiculous it was funny. Personally I never found any of the deaths over the top ENOUGH to truly find them funny, so the other people's laughter just kind of made me uncomfortable... After the bloodbath ends though, ultimately there was nothing there, no deep thoughts, no important message, no point at all really. The closest thing I can up with for meaning in the movie is that in the end, they basically admit there was no real reason for the experiment to be conducted, and so conducting cruel experiments without a purpose is a bad thing? But that seems obvious, right? When chaos ensues, different people react in different ways. It's sort of like the Walking Dead in that sense, but the Walking Dead has time to develop its themes and characters long enough for you to extract some meaning. In a way, the pointlessness of the experiment and the killing is reflected in the pointlessness of the movie itself. I don't know if that's kind of meta, or just a waste of time, but yeah, if you skip this movie, you won't be missing much except seeing a lot of talented actors who always play supporting roles murder each other in the center stage. If you want to see John Ghallager Jr in something better, watch Hush, or The Newsroom. If you want to see Meryl from the Walking Dead, watch The Walking Dead. If you want to see the ideas this movie brings up actually addressed in a thought provoking way, maybe try the Hunger Games, or Battle Royale. This was a fun little film that ultimately means very little."
" Laughably Entertaining
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,7,"I should preface this with the fact that I joke that I'm a terrible person, and as such, I laugh at things that are rather terrible.Here's what I loved about this movie: the soundtrack. It starts with a Latin version of ""I Will Survive,"" which is dramatic irony at its finest. If you know anything about this movie going into it, you know that the person listening to the song probably won't make it to the credits. Then there's use of ""California Dreamin'"" midway through the movie during the worst of the carnage. How were they radio signal when they couldn't get cell signal? Doesn't metal exterior block out radio waves? I'm still confused, but it's totally okay because it was hilarious. Things I also liked about the movie: They don't spend too much time on each individual death which is great because the body count is so high and the movie is relatively short. Plus some of the deaths were either really entertaining, really creative, or a mixture of the two. The cast was pretty great, too. You root for some of the pawns in the Belko Experiment, but you're not too heartbroken when they don't make it.Here's what I disliked: I think I found the movie funnier than any of the other 30 people in the theater.Things that I still hate about this movie: the ending. It could have ended about five minutes before it did, and I would be okay with a straight-to-DVD sequel. The survivor's actions were not believable. There was no reason for him to interact with the voice. It was a discredit the movie."
" Popcorn movie
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,6,"The Belko Experiment - Some movies you see for the intriguing story, while others maybe for the actor or director involved. And then there are times when you just want to shut your brain off for a while and eat some popcorn. This is most definitely a case of the latter.The 'kill or be killed' concept has been done numerous times, so there isn't anything groundbreaking here. Rather than a bunch of teenagers a la Hunger Games, it's 80 coworkers in an office building. Sometimes these stories can really bring out that 'what would you do' feeling. This one doesn't take itself too seriously, so you won't be doing a whole lot of introspection.It's an hour and a half of a concept I've already seen, and it has gratuitous gore, B- C- and D-list actors, and dated special effects. That's not your typical recipe for success, yet somehow the movie makes it work. So maybe that was the experiment all along. 6.5/10"
" Gore-filled horror with an interesting premise
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,6,"Sick and disturbing, The Belko Experiment is a gruesome horror with an interesting premise but not much of a payoff. From the crazy mind of writer James Gunn The story begins with a normal day at work at the Belko Industry in Bogota, Colombia. The first strange part is that there is increased security at the building that confuses the workers but with the threat of narcoterrorism in Colombia, the workers understand there may be times of heightened security. They also understand that they would need to receive an injected tracer so that if they are kidnapped, they'll easily be discovered before the company is forced to pay a ransom. Mike Milch (John Gallagher Jr.) has started a new relationship with his coworker Leandra (Adria Arjona) and has had an easy time for over a year working for Belko. Leandra has to fend off the creepy behavior of Wendell Dukes (John C. McGinley). The COO Barry Norris (Tony Goldwyn) is confused along with the rest of the employees when an announcement comes over the intercom that the employees must kill 30 people or 60 of them will die as the walls are sealed by impenetrable metal. Many like Marty (Sean Gunn) discount this order as a prank or a scare until the tracers in four employees' heads explode.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
" Serviceable Film, But Could've Been Better
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,6,"The strongest part of this film is its premise. It's really fantastic. There is so much possibility for this fun, satirical look at what people will do in certain situations. The film is really filled to the brim with brilliant possibilities. But for the most part, they remain just possibilities. I do think this is a really good script. However, I don't think the execution of this screenplay was as good as if could've been. The characters making decisions and breaking off into groups could have been fascinating and riveting, but it didn't reach the level it should have. The actual streaks of killing could have been so cool to watch, but it comes off as kind of dull. Where the action could have been really inventive and insane, in a Kingsman: The Secret Service kind of way, it ends up being rather rudimentary and bland. There isn't nearly as much electricity or excitement in this film as it deserved to have..."
" The influence of James Gunn, Troma, and John Carpenter is shown in the over-the-top but fun The Belko Experiment
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,8,"For those that work in an office for a big company, you ever notice how there's at least one person there that's either a conspiracy theory nut or doesn't make sense? Ironically for places that claim to want the best of the best, they seem to attract a variety of people, but I notice a lot of individuals who says things about the big boys hiding something or the new boss who comes from upstairs. A lot of this has to do with the act that the bigger the company you work for, the more that your not told of. It's the same way people make theories about the U.S. government having a lot of secrets. There's a lot to say considering companies like Disney, McDonalds, Chevron, or even Trump (the company, not the person) that are covered on CSPAN or Newsweek Magazine all the time, and yet still cast a shadow that people want to glimpse into. Is there something their not telling us? Maybe so, maybe not, but I can see where some of these conspiracy theory nuts are coming from (not to say that their right). The company comes fully clean in the thriller, The Belko Experiment. Belko Industries seems to be a powerful company with a lot of remote offices, including one in Bogotá, Colombia where the film is set. Employee Mike Milch (played by John Gallagher Jr.) heads in along with several coworkers like girlfriend Leandra (played by Adria Arjona), newcomer Dany (played by Melonie Diaz), goon-like executive Wendell (played by John C. McGinley) and boss Barry (played by Tony Goldwyn). It seems that they've only been there for about a year, but the company's goal is nonprofit in helping Americans finding work throughout South America. Things seem to be going fine until steel doors suddenly surround the entire building. A voice (played by Gregg Henry) announces to everyone (including the bosses) that they have a couple of hours to kill thirty of their employees or sixty will be killed. Everyone dismisses the announcement as a prank until a couple of heads start to explode. It's revealed that this was done thanks to the chips that have been installed in the back of the heads of all Belko employees (they were told they were to track them in case of a kidnapping). The race is one to see who will survive when the tension becomes too much and if they can contact the outside in any way.What I have written may sound insane and even dumb, but I actually enjoyed a lot. This is because unlike the similar The Purge that took itself seriously, this is self aware that it's stupid. The script for The Belko Experiment was written by James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy), and it shows. While not really a comedy or a satire, this is over the top in a fun way that shows how these people expose themselves. Even if it does take itself seriously too much in a few parts, I laughed more then I thought I would. The blood count is high and it does not go soft on the gore.What helps is that nearly all the actors are really good. Many of the people you see are probably not recognizable (except for some cast members from Guardians of the Galaxy), but are more people that you might have seen as a side character somewhere else. This pretty much means that instead of big names, your watching some good characters in something of a Battle Royale meets Office Space. Much of the style is clearly influenced from the films of John Carpenter and most material from Troma. I'll give this eight Belko Industries logos out of ten. You cannot expect this to be a serious movie. As long as you watch it as an over-the-top thriller with some comedic moments, you'll have fun. I can't believe that this would be better then Beauty and the Beast, but The Belko Experiment is a success."
" I Definitely Have A Sick Twisted Sense of Humor
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,9,"Enjoyed this movie too much, but I rather suspected I would. The experiment to see who is survival of the fittest, no matter how many times we see it depicted in a movie or program, never proves anything. In real life, we could look at examples of who made it into the lifeboats from the Titanic or who survived the Hindenberg, to the Charles Manson victims, to countless other probabilities, such as the survivors of the crash of Flight 90 in the Potomac river. There is nothing to be gathered from the events. Nothing but fate. Still I enjoyed this movie involving office workers having to eliminate each other. Of course we are given expendable characters we could never like, and Tony Goldwyn and John C. McGinley more than lead the way in that regard. Yes, there will be a few along the way you may sympathize with or enjoy viewing, among these especially is Sean Gunn as Marty, and some that may cause some pondering, such as Dany Wilkins or the custodial lady, but the results is rather obvious at about the mid-way point. You'll be thinking, well, that was that. I couldn't help but compare the scenario to Gremlins II, Stalking Laura (I Can Make You Love Me, based on a true story), and even the Mazerunner series, as well as the Cube movies, slightly wondered about the Saw films. For some reason, Towering Inferno never crossed my mind. There was only one other person sitting in the theatre when I saw this. I suspect he was a theatre employee or something and was just sitting in there; an elderly black man who clearly didn't buy a ticket to see this silly thing.As we left, I told him let's hurry up and get out of here before we decide one of us must be the only survivor and suspect the other of trying to kill him off. He just laughed. I wouldn't be surprised if he pretty much just slept thru the entire movie."

" Repetitive and Thoroughly Unpleasant
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,4,"The Belko Experiment is a nasty, gory, chaotic little horror film that pits an office building full of co-workers against each other in a bloody battle of last man/woman standing. This much you probably already know from the trailer. It's a plot that can be succinctly surmised on a cocktail napkin so it's not like you need much to prime you for what's to occur. What they don't tell you however is The Belko Experiment is a nasty, gory and chaotic little horror film without a center. Hunger Games (2012) meets Office Space (1999)? More like Severance (2006) meets a sad, angry teenager's school shooting fantasy.We catch our first glimpse of our inevitable victims within hours of the titular experiment. There's the office Jim and Pam (Arjona), a couple of one-trick pony side characters that might just make it to the second act (Gunn, Brener, Del Rio), the obvious District 2 sociopaths (Goldwyn, McGinley, Yeoman) and, of course, the mousy office Milton (Diaz) who's just so excited to be starting her first day at the office. It's obvious within the first five minutes which archetypes are going to make it to the top ten, the question becomes, will the other seventy or so office drones be in on the fun or not.Without spoiling too much for the misguided Purge (2013)-o-philes who still want to watch this trash, I'm sorry to say that The Belko Experiment errs on the side of seriousness and pessimism instead of black comedy or pressure-cooker sensationalism. Any lurid fun that can be had at the expense of cubicle flunkies taking out long-seeded frustrations on their managers or visa versa takes a back seat to the actions and motivations of a selective few who camp out on their respective floors hatching their schemes. The films creativity (or lack thereof) is so markedly uninspired that it might as well write ""You'll Get the Point and Little Else Within the Hour"" in big banner lettering.As chaos looms, factions quickly form. Not so much organically, but more as a way of sussing out the good guys from the bad for the sake of the story. Representing team ""give a s**t"" is the amiable Mike (Gallagher) who walks through the blood splattered cork-board of Belko Industries with a halo around his head despite being a bit of an airhead. He's the kind of guy who'd tell everyone to take the stairs instead of the elevator because it's safer. He's the kind of guy who is a salt and pepper mustache away from being Sully Sullenberger; a goody-two-shoes whose persona is so mundane and diametrically opposed to any of the larger-than-life villains that it just reeks of lazy characterization.On the other side of the divide is Barry (Goldwyn) who is ""open to all options,"" so long as those options leave him in control. His arc is a little more nuanced than Mike's but given his title and the company that he keeps, I'm amazed the audience's goodwill got as far as the building's dirt parking lot. We all know he's bad and every discussion had in the building cafeteria mulling over what do to is shaded by his badness - life and family be damned.They're all damned really, though because the lions share of the office has little to no say on how they meet their demise it never seems to matter all that much. The fact that the movie literally lines people up for the slaughter should tell you all you need to know about how repetitive this movie is. For real: Battle Royale (2000), a film with five times more protagonists, still managed to stuff in more plot, meaning and dignity into its story than this film managed to imbue in twelve floors and a murder of recognizable character actors.The Belko Experiment is a grim, mean, repetitive, slog of a movie that takes all the moral, psychological and political subtext of James Gunn's high-concept and smashes them like watermelons bracing against Gallagher's sledge-o-matic. The ends of this cruel little experiment hints at a sequel, the results of which may give this movie some closure. As of now however, the message I heard loud and clear by the end of this mess was, ""watch this movie, and we'll make three more just like it."" Rise above people, rise above."
" Not a bad experiment.
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"Overall the experience is not that bad. It's funny how human nature works.So the movie is about a group of employees who get locked down in a government building and are force to kill a few to save the many.Suddenly, the guy who was your best friend a second ago looks at you differently as the experiment creates two types of people. The ones who believe right is might and want to use strength to control the situation, and those who want to find another situation other than killing.Very similar to the Saw films as these people scramble to make the choice of who will live and who will die before the voice in the intercom that trapped them makes that call and has their heads explode with a messy bomb implanted in there. It also has a few gruesome death scenes as well.It's a good social science study and I like watching to see what people would do in this situation. Entertaining.http://cinemagardens.com"
" Perhaps I was just in the wrong frame of mind when I watched this?
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,2,"Threadbare plot of a group of people who are locked in an eight storey office building in Bogota, Columbia, and being forced to kill a specific number of each other by an unseen, poorly defined enemy in order for the rest to survive, takes a backseat to violence and gore, in this blood- drenched, wannabe thriller/ horror.Anyone who has read any of my earlier reviews can see that I have little problem with watching something gory, if the plot can make it amusing, and grab my attention, which this didn't, hence the 2/ 10 rating. This film's first ten minutes seems like it will be a silly office comedy, before abruptly switching gears, and after so little of a setup, I found it difficult to care when one of its innumerable characters were killed. Most characters were just standing in the background, existing only to be killed, before its Cabin In The Woods- inspired ending drives everyone from the cinema (and I'm not joking, when the film ended, the 2/3 full auditorium was vacated within seconds)The film makes little sense, features incredibly out of place uses of an awful cover of California Dreaming, and largely unfunny attempts at humour sink it even further, making its one hour and twenty-odd minutes run seem much longer than it really is. (Furthermore, if you take out the opening and closing credits, the film would only be an hour and a few minutes long)Filmed in June and July 2015, was shown once at the Toronto International Film Festival, but the not released until March 2017."
" VIEWS ON FILM review of The Belko Experiment
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"A Columbia setting, murder by tape dispenser, the hero being the same guy who got offed by John Goodman in 10 Cloverfield Lane, kneel down executions during a Spanish version of Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive"". Yeah it's all present in 2016's The Belko Experiment (my latest review).So OK, here's the gist: Eighty employees are working at Belko Industries (a fictional company). They become trapped in the facility's huge office building. The walls are sealed off, the air conditioning has been shut down, the security guards are replaced, and an unknown intercom voice instructs the workers to kill thirty of their own or sixty will die instead. I guess you can cross off Hawaiian shirt day or any staff promotions that week. Bummer.Now I like horror films. I like thrillers. Heck, I like a little dark humor as well. ""Belko"" is a mixture of all three. Just imagine 1999's Office Space and The Maze Runner having a cinematic offspring. Now imagine that same offspring turning into a raving sicko. In truth, a truckload of people die in The Belko Experiment. And hey, it's all for the study of human behavior done by lucid, social scientists. To call this movie disturbing is like calling Donald Trump's approval rating unsatisfactory. Both statements are inherently true.Anyway, ""Belko"" is directed by Greg McLean. He's the same dude who did the serial killer flick, Wolf Creek. Greg has a clear vision in that he wants you to squirm one minute and laugh mildly the next. There are exploding heads, endless blood splattering, and death by axes, guns, and knives. Oh and the elevator music in between is a nice touch. That's right, elevator music.In terms of casting for The Belko Experiment, well it reads like a list of veteran B actors who randomly show up in commercial movies from time to time. Yes I'm talking about Tony Goldwyn, John C. McGinley, Melonie Diaz, and Michael Rooker. Call me crazy but I think Greg McLean put Rooker in ""Belko"" just to remind everybody that he was in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. And McGinley, well wasn't he in Office Space mentioned earlier? Just a random thought.All in all, The Belko Experiment has almost no character development in its gory eighty-eight minutes. And within the first ten, you have to quickly get to know everyone and the peril they are about to go through. With its corporate thumb nailing, its dead bodies spread out like mouse droppings, and its cubical nature, ""Belko"" does contain a startling ending that reveals a bigger picture than the movie itself. And yes, this flick is fairly well done and will affect you somewhat psychologically. However, The Belko Experiment feels too demented and/or twisted to freely garner a recommendation. Call it bloody, B-movie mayhem. Call it a maverick, ""experimental"" model. Rating: 2 and a half stars."
" ""The Belko Experiment"" is fairly well-written, well-directed and well-acted, but in the end, this gory morality play is really just much a-goo about nothing.
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,3,"The horror thriller ""The Belko Experiment"" (R, 1:28) comes to us from BH Tilt, an arm of Blumhouse Productions, a film company which has had quite a run so far in the early 21st century, especially for a company that didn't even exist when the century began and only started releasing feature films in 2006. Blumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum put his company on the cinematic map when he co-produced 2007's ""Paranormal Activity"" (along with the movie's writer/director, Oren Peli). That film was made for $15,000 and took in almost $200 million, which led to five sequels. Blumhouse followed that success with the popular ""Insidious"", ""Sinister"", ""The Purge"" and ""Ouija"" horror franchises. They also produced or distributed ""Whiplash"", ""The Gift"", ""The Green Inferno"" and ""Get Out"", and started a relationship with M. Night Shyamalan, which led to his career resurgence with ""The Visit"" and ""Split"". Blumhouse again employed its business model of putting out low budget horror/thrillers (more often than not, for $5 million or less) – and reaping big profits with ""The Belko Experiment"", which made back its $5 million budget in its first few days, in spite of (as is often the case with Blumhouse films) questionable quality.Belko Industries is a vaguely-defined non-profit U.S. company operating at an isolated office building outside Bogota, Columbia (where the movie was actually filmed). On the otherwise ordinary day when the movie takes place, there is extra local security at the company's compound (which only includes the Belko offices and a warehouse located across the dirt parking lot). No one seems to know what's going on, not Belko COO Barry Norris (Tony Goldwyn, from TV's ""Scandal""), the building's security guard (James Earl), the head of maintenance (Michael Rooker), any of Belko's other mainly white-collar employees and certainly not their newest hire, Dany Wilkins (Melonie Diaz). There are extra vehicle checks at the gate and the Columbians who work there aren't even allowed to enter. Well, security is a big concern for foreigners doing business in Columbia, after all. That's why Belko has electronic tracking devices implanted in the necks of all their employees (so they can be located in case they are kidnapped for ransom) and why the building in which they work was constructed to be a veritable fortress.Just as this otherwise ordinary day is getting started, a voice comes over the intercom system (which the employees didn't even know existed) and demands that two of the 80 people present that day be killed within 30 minutes. As a precaution, Belko executives gather everyone in the lobby and Barry addresses his employees, trying to keep them calm. The reactions range from fear to disgust and even amusement at what most of them believe is a prank or sick joke until the voice's deadline passes and four people die when their heads explode. It seems that those tracking implants are actually explosives that can be detonated remotely. The voice again addresses the Belko employees, promising that if they don't kill 30 of their co-workers within the next two hours, 60 more will die the same way that the first four did.With the building now sealed by armored plates which emerge to cover all of the windows and doors, with communications cut off and with several ideas on how to escape or get help failing, the survivors discuss and debate their options. Barry suggests that they may have to do the unthinkable. Some agree with him, including some of his executives (played by John C. McGinley and Brent Sexton). Another Belko executive named Mike Milch (John Gallagher Jr.) insists that none of them have the right to take another human life, no matter what, and he has his supporters as well although he's horrified to learn that his girlfriend, fellow executive Leandra (Adria Arjona), seems to sympathize with Barry's point of view. Other employees are simply paralyzed by fear. Something's gotta give and the clock is ticking.""The Belko Experiment"" is fairly original in its (ahem) execution, but contains strong echoes of movies past and, at the end of the day, is more bloody than beneficial as entertainment. It's ""The Hunger Games"" crossed with ""Office Space"" (or TV's ""The Office""). It's strongly influenced by the 2000 Japanese film ""Battle Royale"" and it reminded me of the 2012 horror flick ""The Cabin in the Woods"". What this 2017 Blumhouse offering does well is put an original spin on the ""survival of the fittest"" subgenre of movies, while functioning as a satire of corporate America and also examining what really motivates human behavior – in the best of times – and the worst of times. Unfortunately, this so-called experiment sheds little fresh light on any of these things and seems to exist mainly to display bloody violence on the big screen. That, and, in retrospect, the whole premise descends into ridiculousness when we learn why all this happened and stop to do a little cost-benefit analysis, from the perspective of the antagonist. It's fairly well-written, well-directed and well-acted, but in the end, this gory morality play is really just much a-goo about nothing. ""C"""
" An Interesting But Flawed Horror Experiment
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"A group of Americans and other foreign Nationals have been hired to work for a multi-national company in Columbia for a company named Belko. The Company offers housing, a car, company credit card and great benefits so people are more than willing to sign up even when company policy mandates that any foreign workers must get a microchip to help track them in the event of a kidnapping.In the new film ""The Belko Experiment"" audiences are taken on a psychological thrill ride about what happens when corporate life takes a nightmare turn.Michael Milch (John Gallagher Jr.), heads to work one morning and finds that the local employees are being sent home by a new and very stern faced and heavily armed security force.One in their modern high rise office, he and his other workers guess it is some sort of security drill and nothing to worry about. His boss Barry Norris (Tony Goldwyn) claims to be unaware of any changes and what is behind them but promises to look into it.When the building's security shutters unexpectedly close and all communications go down, the staff thinks that it is simply another security drill or a test. However a voice over the communication system tells the workers that they must kill two of their group in thirty minutes or suffer the consequences. The group thinks this is all some kind of prank until four people drop dead from the implants in their head which also contain an explosive.Factions soon form as people are unsure what to do next and whom to trust. In a nod to Lord of the Flies, we see what happens when conventions of society break down and how people often revert to a base and brutal nature for survival. When the mysterious voice then tells them that 30 of the group must die or 60 will be killed, the stakes and the action really kick into high gear.The film is at times brutal but not as gratuitous as other films. What it does well is mix characters that many might be able to relate to so you can find yourself wondering how you would react in a situation like the one presented. As the body count and tensions rise, the characters do become a bit like cannon fodder as we are not given enough to care about their survival.The film was written by James Gunn who said the idea came to him in a dream. Gunn is clearly busy with his work on the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" series so Director Greg McLean directed the film and has created an interesting film that does borrow from other films, as it does bring to mind ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Cube"" but it does deliver a good dose of escapist entertainment.3 stars out of 5"

Give Merle more screen time!!! Other than that, great movie though. Very suspenseful and very gory and awesome!! Will definitely be seeing the second one even though Merle won't be in it."
" A fun shallow thriller that lacks originality but entertaining.
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,7,"The Belko Experiment is a bloody mess fun that goes for so long until it wears down with the body count. Produced and written by James Gunn, the same guy that can write a fun horror thriller like Dawn of the Dead or Slither (a little grossed out film). The script is able to flash out the characters by giving them characteristics on who they are in the movie and how they will all turn out when everything hits the fan of chaos. The plot follows Mike (John Gallagher Jr.) a regular employee going to work at a Belko company in Colombia. It's a nonprofit government organization that requires employees to get tracking devices implanted in the back of their heads for insurance policies if they were ever to get kidnapped in Colombia. Every one checks in the office like Mike's girlfriend Leandra (Adria Arjona), a new employee Dany (Melonie Diaz), A techie Keith (Josh Brener), a Maintenance guy Bud (Michael Rooker), a perverted office employee Wendell (John C. McGinley), and their boss Barry (Tony Goldwyn). Every thing changes, when the shutter doors close down the building and an announcement from a strange voice demands they kill a certain amount of employees or else the devices in their heads will kill many more in the building. What worked with the film is it was quite entertaining especially for the horror thriller genre enthusiast. The concept idea was kind of mysterious as some unknown watcher is playing some sick experiment seeing how people would react in stressful situations. Even playing the idea of human nature will do whatever it takes to survive, even if it requires them to kill a coworker, their friend, etc. Who is this mysterious watcher? And what is the purpose of this sick social experiment? When things hit the fan and every one starts to break into group with the boss taking charge and becoming the decision maker on who lives and who dies does create that fear. The movie does have a lot of brutal violence, even a sequence when they put a group of people in a side that have no children, and are expendable on that wall for them to be shot at. A bit of an overkill and a very dark direction. Once you can point out the bad group of people and a good-sided people that are fighting back and hoping to survive the terror of this experiment can be thrilling. What I felt like it did not work with the film, as it can be thrilling to see how people would react or become violent to others and the final half hour of the movie with a lot of body counts. It can wear down to being just another shallow horror thriller, which does not make the film worth rewatching. Also, the plot does build up this mysterious voice that is demanding people to do the unthinkable. I was hoping to expect a bigger answer to this experiment. Sure, the ending can go to a bigger picture, as in something more is behind this. (without giving away spoilers). A story pitting people against each other and fighting to the death, sure does sound like we seen that before in The Hunger Games or Saw. Overall, The Belko Experiment is a fair thriller film that builds up the suspense and its violent sequences of seeing people kill each other. The plot does not build anything new, and the action can be repetitive. I would rate the film 3.5 out of 5."
" well made and efficient while also being not all that fun
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,5,"According to the IMDb trivia (which who can ever know if it's true, but let's pretend it is), James Gunn originally was going to direct his own script of The Belko Experiment, but decided (aside from some other personal issues) to step aside due to not wanting to spend all the time that it would take to helm a movie full of brutal, nihilistic and hard-R-can-it-get-to-unrated levels of violence. I have to wonder if there was another reason, that he knew this wasn't up to the standards of his best work - this includes the equally grim but much funnier Super and Slither, and what could be seen as the polar opposite of this tone-wise with his work in Marvel's Guardians series - and that the tone was too much for anyone to bear. Kudos I suppose to Greg McLean, who does, at the least, a better job with this material than some tepid work like The Darkness. But it's also not something I could care to ever revisit - yes, even on threat of murder and/or that I'd have to murder someone.And on the note of the direction, it is a well-made film as far as how the pacing of it goes - it's a slim 82 minutes - and is cast with people I really like (John Gallagher from last year's 10 Cloverfield Lane, Tony Goldwyn, John C. McGinley, Gunn regular Michael Rooker who I wished was in the film, sort of spoiler, longer, and Gunn's brother Sean who was the most ""fun"" to watch). What doesn't work is that Gunn's concept, a riff on Battle Royale (no, this time it's a good comparison, more than the Hunger Games), doesn't really match up to the level of the execution of the material which is lackluster.More work needed to be put into the characters for me to care past it being a standard slasher movie, which this also is to an extent. The stakes are that the characters are in this office and everyone will die (tracers, meant to be there for the employees ""protection"" in case of kidnappers doesn't seem like a sound premise that employees would pay heed to, but okay I'll try to suspend disbelief since it is Columbia), and the directions are that X number of characters must be killed by Y number of time otherwise Z number will be offed. I had a little faith that perhaps Gunn would try to be clever with the premise, or try and go for exploring some of the psychological depths that could come out of this pressure-cooker situation (an element of the Stanford Prison Experiment is there too). The main issue is wasted potential.Take that prison experiment comparison; in that scenario, which was in real life too and also was a film a couple years ago, people had to gradually torture others and dynamics were built. Here the idea is more like 'well, these employees, for the most part, have been together long enough so the dynamics are already there.' But it's very basic dynamics here, drawn like how it might happen where the characters we're introduced to early on in the first 15 minutes are going to be the *really bad* on one side and the ones that are our heroes (or close to it as likable side characters like Sean Gunn) will be on the other. Every step of this ends up being predictable, and furthermore when it comes to the kills - by the time the last stretch comes and it's 'kill or be killed' for all involved, we're left with the characters we expect, and that's a problem.Why not surprise us and off a character out of nowhere, or, when a particularly graphic moment happens about 2/3rds of the way in, characters we thought were going to make it don't? Another issue comes with the use of suspense and tone; there are a few pockets where things get intense as f***for a particular character (one involves an elevator that brought back memories of Speed or Mission:Impossible), and yet there's only so much creativity that can come with the cat-and-mouse dynamic in an office building (a lower boiler-room level is used but not enough). The tone part of it is that, well, this *is* bleak as hell and we're in for a nasty ride. I was fine with that, but, and maybe this is more on the director's end than the writer, there wasn't any kind of necessary/relief. If you thought you were getting a comedy-horror, it's less that than just horror-horror.Again, unpleasantness can make a movie compelling and unique in some ways - Gunn's own Super has a similar grim outlook, though early on one might think Belko is showing humans trying to work together and not stoop to the murderous depths of depravity that they end up going to anyway - but what if there's nothing else but? It's a strange position I feel I'm in as I can tell you The Belko Experiment shows this tone with conviction and maintains its nastiness until (almost) the final shot (which by the way is just bad and confusing past trying to, uh, open up room for a sequel, what?) At the same time, I left the movie feeling depressed and unclean.I applaud all of the cast for going through what its own writer couldn't go through and in a way I don't blame the writer for putting it out there. I just wish he had done a better job with making sharper characters and some of the logic to the storytelling while spending most of the creative energy on how people kill one another. It's a truly mixed bag."
" Office Hunger Games
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,7,"I saw ""The Belko Experiment"", starring John Gallagher Jr.-10 Cloverfield Lane, Jonah Hex; Tony Goldwyn-Scandal_tv, The Last Samurai; Adria Arjona-Emerald City_tv, True Detective_tv; John C. McGinley-Alex Cross, Scrubs_tv and Michael Rooker-Guardians of the Galaxy, The Walking Dead_tv.This is a horror/thriller that has lots of similarities to other films- The Hunger Games, The Purge, etc.-but especially to a Japanese film from 2000 called 'Battle Royale'-In it, 9th graders were pitted against each other to fight to the death. Anyway, this one is about an office in Bogota, Columbia owned by the Belko corporation that has been in operation for about a year and employs mostly Americans who have all been implanted with trackers in their bodies to insure their safety-they are told that there are lots of kidnappings in the area and the trackers will keep them safe. One day a strange thing happens; Metal plates slide over all the doors and windows, locking all 80 employees inside. Then, a voice comes over the p.a. system saying that everyone is locked in and the only way they can leave is if they follow orders. Their first order is to kill 4 people and if they don't do it, the mysterious voice promises to kill more than 4-You see, the implanted trackers are actually tiny explosives. Of course, no one believes the voice until a demonstration is performed. Then the stakes are raised to having to kill 30 people and so on and so on and then it is a question of who will be left standing, if anyone. Tony is the CEO in charge of Belko. John G., Adria and John M. are employees and Michael is a maintenance man. It does get pretty brutal and makes you think about what you would do in such a situation. I mean, most sane people do not want to kill another person, especially a friend you work with, but you don't want to die, either. It's rated ""R"" for strong bloody violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 28 minutes. It's not for everyone but I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."
" The Belko Experiment is Bloody, Brutal, B - Movie Fun, and a Bad Day at the Office
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,6,"We've all had those days where we felt like killing our fellow co workers. It's just another day at the office. Filing papers, wearing a tie that took 20 minutes to long to put on, stapling papers, photocopying papers, half-asleep security guard, someone smoking a blunt before break, and computer work that no one feels like really doing. In Columbia, 80 American workers have what seems like a very day-to-day office job working at Belko. Suddenly, large metal doors shield the building. A mysterious voice comes over the intercom telling the workers, if you guys do not kill a certain amount of people within the time period we give you, we are going to kill double that and kill random people. At first, the workers think it is all a joke, but this is no laughing matter. From that point on, people's heads explode; we get gunfire, murder, carnage, and office employees fighting each other to the death! Damn, and I thought my job was killer.At times, this movie feels like it could have been a 80s movie. This film is written by James Gunn, and when it comes to movies that he has written, I feel like I can tell from the script he is someone who was inspired by 80s sleaze movies. For instance, his 2006 movie Slither feels very much like 1986s Night of the Creeps. I personally enjoy those types of movies, and I thought the movie captured that likeness and tone very well. There was never really a dull moment in this movie, mainly because the film dives right into the kill your peers plot. Really, within 15 minutes or less the ball gets rolling.Is The Belko Experiment as Bad as People are Making it Out to Be?As I mentioned, I do enjoy the movie from a horror and B – Movie standpoint. On the other hand, I wish the movie could have been more original, and written a little bit better. Honestly, in my opinion this is the weakest James Gunn script he has written.James Gunn is one of my all time favorite directors. I like Slither, and I absolutely love Super and Guardians of the Galaxy. I actually consider those two movies to be on my all time favorites list. I believe this movie would have been better if Gunn actually directed it. Not that the director, Greg McLean is bad, because he is not by any means. I just think Gunn would have made for some better comedic moments, thrills, and tone. This movie takes itself seriously, and I think the tone of Slither, comedy/horror, would have made for a better tone. In addition, I believe this script could have been more original and overall written a little bit more effectively. This movie has a great concept, a concept we've seen so many times before. Only this time it is with a parade of gore. This movie reminds me of so many other movies. For instance, Saw, The Hunger Games, Battle Royale, and The Running Man.This movie has an amazing concept, but it touched upon familiar ground. I feel like with some rewrites this film could have been that fun B – Movie horror film, with a little comedic moment, and could have had a message for the audience. A message about human morals, selfishness, playing God, instincts, human psychology and our will to survive. Even though I mentioned there is not one dull moment throughout the film, the kills get a little dull after a while. A majority of the office workers kill each other with guns and knives. Maybe this is the horror movie nerd in me, but I was hoping for at least that one badass kill I could remember. I wish there was that one kill that was creative. For example, maybe they use some more office supplies to kill each other. Bash someone's head repeatedly on a copy machine, while the person is bashing their brains out, photocopies come out of the printer of the person's head being slammed. Or a small crossbow made out of pencils and rubber bands. Something like the Office Depot of death!I really do have mixed feelings about this movie. At the end of the day, it did entertain me, and that is one of the most important things for me when it comes to movies. I do believe it is one of the weaker James Gunn scripts, and this story had more areas to explore. I believe The Belko Experiment earns a6.5 out of 10.Well I'm about to clock out from this review, because this job has got me tired. Until next time, thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)"
" The Belko Experiment takes on going postal well but, like the phrase, you'll be left remembering the violence more than the story behind the violence.
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,6,"HighlightsIt's Is Pleasantly ViolentExcuse what will surely sound twisted, but the one thing this movie does well is its gore. In many ways, it brings a similar type of blood and mangled looking bodies you'd see in SaW, just without the torture being involved. Do you like seeing people's skulls blow up or them being beaten in with an ax? How about as much blood splatter as you expect from a Quentin Tarintino movie? What about dumb-asses who could have lived if they just stayed in their hiding spots? Yet, because they are so stupid, you low key feel they deserved to be killed off? Well, this movie is for you.CriticismIt Sets Up A SequelBeing that when I saw this it was a Friday night and a nearly empty theater, and I don't live in the shticks, I think it is safe to say this won't be any sort of competition for Beauty and the Beast. With that said, unfortunately, it seems the experiment we witness is just part of a larger one and we only saw phase 1. But believe me when I say that when this movie ends, you will have no interest in phase 2.On The FenceIt's All About Personality and Not So Much DevelopmentReason being, while each character has a strong personality, ranging from crazy to authoritative, sassy Black girl to sassy gay guy, there isn't much depth to anyone. Hence why, in this whole review, no one's name is mentioned. For really, all you are given is bland archetypes. Ones which, I should note, Tony Goldwyn and John C. McGinley play up to the point they seem wasted on this movie. Yet, as much as they present the bosses who care more about their lives and safety, and to a point their ego, more than their employees, they don't save this film.Overall: Negative (Skip It)The film isn't horrible but it's just overburdened by its own concept. The idea of some sort of social scientists terrorist forcing people to kill each other for an unfiltered view and understanding of the human psyche was executed in such a ridiculous way. Especially since the movie is supposed to take place over the course of one work day and a lot of people are quickly killed indiscriminately. Add on that no one killed is someone you felt like you got to know and thus want to root for and it only leaves the violence. Of which, to be honest, if you are the type of person who likes gore in the form of heads being blown off or something twisted enough that it deserves side eye? Well, this will barely feel like an appetizer to you. This would be the type of film you show your 12 your old sibling to see if they may share the same taste as you but without getting them traumatized.Hence the negative label. The main, if not sole, selling point here is the violence. Violence which may make you flinch once or twice, but for those who love horror films like SaW or even foreign ones like Martyrs, this won't set any new standard for you. Then for those who likes some sort of story or depth in their horror, like Get Out or Let The Right One In, this has nothing for you on that side either. Thus leaving you with a film which seems like the passion project James Gunn got to produce solely because of how well Guardians of the Galaxy did."
" rip-off of many original plots and danganronpa
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,3,"The whole plot of the movie is basically a rip-off of the extremely popular Japanese pop-culture franchise ""Danganronpa"" (lit. bullet refutation) where 16 high school students are trapped inside a school/island/jail ( its a trilogy this far) and forced to kill their classmates in order to survive. The basic plot / theme is a rip-off from it"
" A bloody good time.
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,5,"The Belko Experiment is a messed up film and it's wildly entertaining.The Belko Experiment is an indie film that's essentially about a office building that gets shut down and the people inside are forced to kill each other.Here's the good.The story in this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat practically the whole run time of the movie. It's a physiological horror film that really asks the audience, ""What would you do in this situation?"". I was lucky enough to be at a screening of the film with writer/producer James Gunn and the director Greg McLean and most of the cast. They talked a lot about how there was no villain in this movie, which is something I loved. The people in this movie were all acting for themselves, doing what they need to do for their family or for survival. The story in the beginning and the middle is very interesting and will keep the audience entertained well after the movie is over.The acting in this movie is, for the most part, believable and good. Tony Goldwyn, John Gallagher Jr., and Sean Gunn were the standouts of this movie. Tony was terrifying, and just as he talked about during the Q and A at the screening, his character wasn't a villain. His character was doing what he had to do to make sure he could come home to his family again, even if is terrible. John Gallagher Jr. does a fantastic job as the main character. He displays a wide variety of emotions perfectly and pulls off a really really good performance, surpassing his acting in 12 Cloverfield Lane. The real standout of this movie is Sean Gunn who did a fantastic job with his character. He has some of the best and most memorable lines in the whole film. It's amazing to see how far Sean Gunn has gone in his acting ability when compared to his role in James Gunn's Super. Everyone in the movie, including the extras, pulled off great performances.The technical parts of this movie are very well done. I have tons of respect for this movie's use of practical effects which added a lot of horror to the movie's tone. The cinematography in this movie was impressive, keeping a lot of shots close to give off a claustrophobic feeling. The lighting in this movie is used perfectly. Towards the latter half of the movie, many action sequences were lit uniquely. A action scene lit by a neon light and fire or a flickering light, whatever the case, it built the suspense. Here's the bad.The ending of this film is different. It didn't really set up the ending all that well and left the audience wanting something a bit more. It didn't ruin the fun of the movie but with a better ending it could have been a lot better. For a movie to be great it needs to have an ending that leaves the audience satisfied and this movie has trouble doing that. Overall, The Belko Experiment is a thrill ride. When the action and horror and suspense hits, it hits hard. The acting from everyone is entertaining and believable, many performances being especially good. The lighting and cinematography add a lot to the overall tone of the film which makes it a lot more effective. While the ending leaves you wanting more, you'll still be thinking about this movie for days to come."
