" Never finished the movie
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,1,The cast is amazing and a lot of them are my favourite actors. But being a dad myself then I can no longer stomach watching killings of babies. It is also quite explicit.So after quite a lot of killings of babies by the mentally ill mothers then I had to turn off the movie.I only got about 1/3 into the movie before I had to turn it off. It makes me sick to watch.Otherwise it might be a good movie but it is just not for me. If you can stomach the explicit baby killing then it might be for you and it might be a great movie. I don't know.
" NOT for the tender of heart
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,7,"*No spoilers, except whether this film has a happy ending.* This movie bothered me for days. I found it quite good otherwise, frequently charming and disarming, and then, a SHOCK more than halfway through, one of the most tragic scenes I've ever seen. I'm a mental health professional and I've encountered many terrible things in real life, generally I'm pretty thick-skinned but this REALLY stuck with me. My purpose here is to warn those who are tender of heart that not only does this not have a happy ending or positive outcome, many may find it downright disturbing, depressing. The main redeeming qualities of his film are that it's very well-acted and directed, and an extremely astute, frequently brilliant character study. But there's little recompense for or erasing this sad, sad, heartbreaking scene and what led up to it. If you're sensitive you may want to skip this one."
" A Western that feels like a real story
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,9,"This film has shocking moments the viewer doesn't see coming. The Old West here is not romanticized or sanitized. In fact, it appears to be nothing short of Hell on earth, so brutally cruel it drives people mad. But the story is solid, the dialogue rings true, the acting first rate. It is a crime it didn't do better box office.But bravo, Tommy Lee Jones. This is outstanding."
" Should Have Been Titled ""Homewoman"" With A Rewrite
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,4,"Pretty much a grim movie overall. Decent performances by the two leads, but just grim, sloppy, depressing writing overall. No wonder this movie didn't do good at the box office. When you have a bunch of crazy women riding in a stage coach, screeching and moaning, that's enough to turn you off right there. Then the writer allows the strong frontier woman to up and hang yourself in the middle of the movie. Sorry, but that didn't match her strong-willed character. Maybe the best part of the movie is when Tommy Lee Jones's character burns down a hotel to get revenge for turning them away.Sad to say, but I would not recommend this movie, unless you just cannot find anything else to watch. The screenwriter should have taken the script, and made a few changes to it to make it more watchable. Perhaps it should've been called ""Homeswoman,"", with Hillary Swank's Mary Bee Cuddy's character making the full haul across the plains, while Tommy Lee Jones' character George Briggs' goes nuts and kills himself midway thru the movie. Anyways, I would have expected a little bit more coming from Tommy Lee Jones directing. But I guess all great actors can't be as good of director as Clint Eastwood."
" Outstandingly Example of Filmaking
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,10,"How is this film not a 10/10 score? It is utterly outstanding - every character is well written and the story is totally heartbreaking. Beautifully shot, perfectly paced, fantastic dialogue. If you only ever watch one film about the settlement of the west, make it this one. It also has William Fichtner in it. Winner all day long, this guy is brilliant in everything he's ever been in."
" A truly wonderful film
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,10,"The writing, directing, photography, music & acting in this film are second to none. It will never be top on everyones list but I'm grateful I had the chance to see it. Tommy Lee Jones is one of the most underrated actors & has now added writing & directing to his skill set.
A highly recommended film to watch"
" Western triumph
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,9,"The pioneer life was never a glorious life and the tough times endured nearly hourly that could drive some absolutely nuts quite literally. This story follows three young wife's whose life in the Wild West has done just that, drove them on the brink of insanity and the burden they carried on their families grew too much to bear. Mary Bee Cuddy, a respected member of the community is tasked with transporting the three women to a safe place where their mental issues will possibly be helped or even resolved. She quickly nominated herself to the journey as she is single and eager to be of some sort of service, the old Wild West ideologies run Mary through and though.
Before heading out she employs and gunslinging drifter who quickly obliges as he appears to be running from his own demons. Just as all journeys went during these times their plight is not an easy one and proves to be as bleak and dark as you're imagination leads you. This journey through madness has pretty and ugly endings for all involved."
" UNBELIEVABLE
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,5,"Really thought this movie was going to be good. Good cast. And it started off ok. But when Hillary Swank's character - a relatively young woman, with land, and money in the bank - proposes marriage to two men and is rejected by both (and one a world weary old codger - almost twice her age) - that is when it went off the rails for me. And the final train wreck was when the old codger finds her HANGING FROM A TREE.. (This happens right after the night she seduces him. Was the sex with TLJ's character that bad??!!) It made no sense. The character Swank plays is a religious woman who is ON A MISSION to help save the women who had been driven mad by the hardships of pioneer life. Her sudden (and unbelievable) decision to hang herself from a tree - and abandon the mission - was way way out of character. And how was that managed? There was no chair to stand on and kick out from under her. Then TLJ burning down the big house in the middle of nowhere and KILLING everyone in it just because they had told him ""no room at the inn"" for himself and his charges. Took a lot away from his grizzled old but ""nice guy"" image in the story. Once Hillary's character is gone...then it is TLJ all the way to an ending that was perplexing and disappointing at the same time.. Here is my rewrite: They make it to Meryl Streep's place, drop off the three women who need help, make their way back to Hillary's ranch, Hillary offers him a job - and with no other prospects - he accepts. Then we leave them sitting on matching rocking chairs on the front porch with the question in the air - is it likely to be a marriage or... ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."""
" Ridiculous film, would give it 0 stars if I could
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,1,"The fact this film is hailed by some as a 'feminist western' is a joke. The attention-grabbing and visceral scenes felt gratuitous - they weren't explored or explained. The main themes of mental illness and womanhood during a troubled time in history were not explored in any depth at all, just some scenes thrown in there that left you feeling there must be so much more that you're not being shown. The women's stories were barely explored, it all became about Tommy Lee Jones' character development and the overall storyline trundled along clumsily, until it eventually ends strangely and without much direction. Of COURSE the screenplay was written and directed by (and starred) Tommy Lee Jones himself. It was a strange film that I am only glad to have watched if not to give me something else to talk about besides covid."
" Very disappointing
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,4,Attracted to this film because of the cast but was very disappointed. Meryl Streep only appeared very briefly at the end. Would have given up very early but wanted to know the end. Found the early part of the film very difficult to follow to see where everyone fitted in. Sorry not to be recommended viewing.
" Good looking film, but it's lacking something....
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,6,"Two strong performances from Tommy Lee Jones and Hilary Swank do much to lift this rather simple, plodding, story but sadly in the end, it seemed to me to be a very thinly spread amalgam of stories that lacked any real substance and was, frankly, quite depressing. Swank is ""Mary Bee Cuddy"" who is looking after three women who have, for various reasons, found the pioneering life of the wild west beyond them and pretty much lost the plot, psychologically speaking. Being a good Christian, she decides to relocate these women into the care of a distant church. Meantime, TLJ is the drifter ""George Briggs"" whom she happens upon strung up from a tree. She releases him on condition that he helps her escort her charges, and off we go on a perilous trek. The cinematography is gorgeous - it's great at conveying not just the scale of the country they are crossing, but also of the harshness of the wintry conditions they must endure as they travel. Their lengthy journey, though, really robs the film of any pace, and the inevitable bonding of the two after some initial suspicion is just too predictable - and uncomfortable to watch. It's not without it's tragedy, but somehow even that didn't resonate much and by the time it reached it's conclusion I felt that I'd been watching two hours with something missing... It is beautifully crafted film with a good accompaniment from Marco Beltrami, but I'm not sure I'll ever watch it again."
" Horrible Tommy Lee Jones movie
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,4,Star power and name recognition got me to watch this whatever it is.I don't mind dark movies but this is nearly unwatchable it's so boring.I don't get why this movie got excellent reviews. It's hard to follow and just the basic premise of it is not what i would call movie worthy.If you're expecting Tommy Lee Jones to be Tommy Lee Jones don't watch this one.
" That's it?
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,3,"This is one of those movies that I get to the end of spending two hours waiting for a decent ending and say, 'that's it?'. What a waste of time! Tommy Lee Jones should stick to acting."
" Dumb, depressing story
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,1,"Very little of this movie made any sense and on top of that, it was just plain depressing. Tommy Lee Jones and Hillary Swank did well enough with their acting, but the plot is extremely murky. Did Jones' character find redemption? In one scene, maybe; in the next, definitely not; at the end, he seemed as crazy as the rest of the characters. The three crazy women seemed to improve a bit under the care of Swank's character, Mary Bee. But Mary Bee committed the ultimate crazed act, completely contrary to the Christian beliefs we were led to believe she held close to her heart. She went off the deep end when they came upon a child's desecrated grave. She then proposed marriage for at least the second time and she was once again rejected, but that is totally nonsensical. She was strong and caring and she had means (from where, we don't know). She was bossy, but even so, plenty of men would have been lining up to marry her. She also abandoned the very people for whom she seemed to care so much.
John Lithgow and James Spader were effective in very small roles.
I don't normally write reviews, but I felt obligated to save others from wasting their time on this tripe."
" It was really good until the ending
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,5,"This film has a solid start and stays consistent throughout. The settings are well detailed and the script was thought provoking. The idea of this movie is great and it is an above average movie, but the ending was so bad.
Briggs makes it to Iowa but doesn't fit in so he heads west again. It felt like they only killed off mary after they ran out of budget to make the script originally planned. The ending left a sour tasting in my mouth and wished it just ended differently. Although this is a very good movie from start to near end and is a pretty good movie."
" Just Awful
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,2,A mish mosh of scenes. Acting good; scenery good. Story is utter nonsense. Would not waste my time.
" An undervalued work of art.
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,"Strange, episodic, and heart wrenching. Infused with a tangible bittersweetness. Jones gives no easy answers or happy endings, perhaps even postulating there are none. A quietly haunting film made with an admirable degree of restraint."
" You won't find a more realistic film in the Wild West
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,8,"What makes this top-notch is the story. Every minute adds more intricate details to this hard knock tale of life in the old Wild West. This will show you how tough it was just to survive in those days. Some women couldn't take it & cracked mentally. One woman threw her alive newborn son down the outshouse hole. Another mother of two girls lays in bed 24/7 talking jibberish. Another woman has to be tied down or she attacks. This is a story of 3 women who lost their minds & became too heavy of burdens on their families & the community. Remember, back then everyone was busy from sun up to sun down just trying to survive. No one had time to tend to an uncooperative woman who isn't worth anything & can't contribute anything. Grown women who do nothing all day but scream & wail, poop themselves, & cause problems were a dilemma. This is there story."
" Art
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,9,"This film is surprising in many different ways - surprising in terms of quality itselt, surprising in the way it was made since it is very unique, surprising the observer several times throughout it's playtime through plottwists and contrasted switches through sceneries. It is a merciless travel through the harsh reality of a generation that is - in terms of real time - not too far away and yet forgotten.The characters are loaded, but not overloaded with symbolic and metaphoric meaning. The evil person traveling a hard world together with the good person, both, in parts, failing on what they seem to be. However, nothing is white or black in this film, everything is more or less grey like the mud they are traveling on.And throughout this story, the film manages to set shock-moments alike with moments of joy and horror. It is like everything that rises falls apart again. Like a very unique form of Anti-Hollywoodism (with the quality of a Hollywood-Film), it is a melancholic, sad, in times nihilistic seeming film with glimpses of hope.A lovely piece of art, not exactly for a romantic evening, but an artsy experience of sadness."
" For the Most Part a Realistic Western... I Think
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,7,"Watching The Homesman, I felt lucky to be living in this era of vaccines, automobiles and believe it or not, fast food restaurants. Any of those would have been a blessing for the characters in the movie. I would guess the film was set in the time period shortly before the Civil War. The story was about a single female farmer in the Kansas plains who volunteered to take three mental ill women for help requiring an overland journey of several weeks. Early on she picked up a drifter played by Tommy Lee Jones who agreed to go along on the trek after being guaranteed $300 upon completion of the trip.For me, the most interesting aspect of the movie was how much things have changed in the past approximately 150 years, changes in scientific advancements, lifestyles, and cultural norms. Of course that is assuming that The Homesman is somewhat accurate in its representation of the period, place, and its people.If I have one complaint it is with the casting. Hilary Swank plays the part of Mary Bee Cuddy, supposedly a homely woman scratching out a living as a farmer. Although it is a good performance, Swank is a little too attractive to pull-off the character. Tommy Lee Jones, who directed and co-wrote the screenplay, played the part of the drifter. He is too old for the character by about 20 years. Josh Brolin or Russel Crowe might have been better or they could have really made it interesting and gone with someone such as Paul Giamatti."
" The Wrath of Wild West!
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,6,"Homesman is the term used to describe the men who used to transport the migrants who'd settled in the American West back to their original hometown in the East. The conditions that the settlers faced in the west were particularly harsh and many people lost their bearings in the process. This is a movie about a woman, who's set to be the 'Homesman' for three women who have been rendered mentally incapacitated due to the harsh life that they endured in the West. Before starting the journey, she enlists the help of a resourceful old man by saving his life.Now, I'm not a faint-hearted person but halfway into the movie, I found myself uninterested. The agony faced by the female characters became too difficult to watch. The story suddenly became too awful for me & from that point onward, it became a drag. Even though the things weren't so bad afterwards, I only kept watching till the end because I was too far along in the movie and decided to muddle through it.I didn't really buy the premise that a healthy, young and hard-working woman of child-bearing age wasn't able to find herself a man in the wild west where people (especially women if this film is to be believed) were struggling to maintain their sanity. Such a well adapted person would be a boon to anyone considering that she owned some land and livestock too. I also don't understand why it couldn't have been the husband of one of those women who became the homesman since they were morally obligated to do so anyway. I expected these men to be better behaved than that, especially when their honor was at stake.Also, Swank's character starts out as a very strong, capable and responsible woman. Just how someone like her could abandon her moral responsibility and give in to her personal demons is beyond my understanding.Setting aside my gripe about the inconsistencies in Swank's character, let me say that the performances of all the actors were superb. The photography is excellent too. The clever use of the minimal music was appropriate, given the subject matter.A hard-to-watch but decent film. Alas, it felt soulless!"
" Decent...
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,4,Overall a decent movie. Not the best and far worse movies out there to watch. I think this movie is for a more selective audience so give it about 30-40 minutes and then decide. Best part of the movie is definitely Swank. She is so diverse she can pull off just about any role put in front of her.
" A Vein Opener Of An Oater
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,"Although a beautiful, finely made film, this is also the saddest Western I've ever seen, tragic to the point of heartbreak. This makes sense since it takes an unflinching look at the real frontier experience and is definitely not some Hollywood fantasy. Three women in mid-19th Century Nebraska go mad from the strain of living on the raw, empty prairie. Unable to care for them, local folk decide to send them back East, a migration in reverse.Hilary Swank gives an outstanding performance as Mary Bee Cuddy, the finest, truest example of a brave, good frontier woman in film I've ever seen, better even than Jean Arthur in Shane. I deeply admired her character as the movie went on and empathized with her struggles and disappointments, many at the hands of thoughtless, callous men. Her tragic, unexpected end simply made me want to weep.On the other hand, George Briggs, the protagonist played by Tommy Lee Jones (who also directed), is the sorriest excuse for a Western hero who ever forked a horse. A larcenous, lying, shiftless drifter who thinks exclusively of himself, rescued from hanging by Cuddy's unexpected arrival, Briggs's sluggish development of the rudiments of a conscience as he travels with Cuddy and the madwomen back to Iowa constitutes the story's moral arc. Despite occasional kindness and displays of frontier savvy and toughness, Briggs is never fully sympathetic, with instances throughout the film of his general bad character and others' contempt and disregard for him. Jones gives his usual professional performance, completely committed to the role, unpleasant as it is.Jones also did an outstanding job directing. Long shots of the bare, unforgiving Nebraskan plains with miserable sod huts cut into low hills to escape the punishing wind, effective backstories showing how each poor, suffering woman went mad, accurate mise-en-scene with authentic period detail throughout, and strong performances all around by well cast actors. Three particular standouts are John Lithgow as a good hearted, frontier minister; Tim Blake Nelson in a brief, but effective turn in one of his signature rustic roles, and Meryl Streep as the minister's wife who takes the madwomen into her home in Iowa.The film's last scene is especially effective: the incorrigible reprobate Briggs dances and sings aboard a ferry headed back West, accompanied by a banjo and bones, with strong intimations of his own imminent death. Jones shows grace and style in this scene and I'm certain he meant to evoke the famous 19th Century painting of a young man dancing aboard a flatboat. Yet rather than evoke images of hope, progress, and growth, the conclusion only hints at more miserable violence.This is a good Western, but not for folks who prefer stuff like Gene Autry or John Wayne flicks."
" Imaginative
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,7,"Well dramatized, well conceived story of 19th century frontier life. Excellent acting by Hillary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones."
" Pointless
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,3,"Some nice cinematography but otherwise, imo, not worth watching.
The suicide of the Hilary Swank character, at the end, was unexplicable, certainly unexplained.
In the end, I felt robbed of two hours."
" Vile and disgusting!!!
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,1,"You might as well have just laid the camera on the ground and taking a big dump on it as far as I'm concerned!. This is going to be a spoiler! I will market as such. In the first 10 minutes you see an elderly woman passed away and the husband and wife fist fighting as he drags her out in the snow as soon as she's died if she's even totally dead, you can't tell, because he's convinced she's going to start smelling up his house. That's part one!
The next you see some really crude impotent little man obviously not even ready for action rape some woman standing up proclaiming, ""you're going to give me a son."" What horse crap! The likelihood this tiny little guy could even rape an obviously non interested woman from that position...just not well thought out unless your point was just to be totally gross.
Then the 3rd thing, in the first 10 minutes, semi nude woman in her nightgown drags out of her house and the bitter cold with a newborn baby held to her chest. The baby looks as if it's nursing but is not moving so I thought it was probably dead. Of course I thought it was absurd she would be going to the outhouse when obviously at that time she would've had a bucket for that sort of thing inside of the house. Obviously someone didn't think this through very well either! Then she ripped the baby from her chest as it just started crying and hurled it like a football into the hole in the middle of the toilet in the out house! I said what a bunch of crap and turned that stupid bad movie off! Why was such good talent in this ridiculous piece of crap movie? What a letdown. I had heard it was bad. Should have listened!"
" Unbelievably touching
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,9,"Wow! This one snuck up on me.I am not automatically drawn to a film just because it's a western. I have seen some wonderful westerns and some just haven't done it for me. This one I'd put in the ""wonderful"" category.There is a trend to glorify movies that depict the West as it likely was rather than through the usual Hollywood over-polished veneer. This one definitely feels authentic. I advise anyone who loves film to check it out."
" Homesmen
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,This movie based on a novel. Tommy Lee Jones both starred and directed the movies about a Christian ladies journey to deliver 3 senile ladies to a Iowa Church

" Flat and depressing with not much original to offer
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,4,"I'm not a huge fan of Westerns, but I thought The Homesman had an intriguing premise. It is about a trio of women who've been driven crazy by the tough times they've seen on the frontier. So, a strong-willed woman, and an outlaw drifter are tasked with transporting them back to the colonies. Despite the potential of the story, the filmmakers didn't do much with it. I found the entire movie somewhat bland and depressing. Hilary Swank tries hard to bring some emotional depth to the story, but she can't quite make it work. I appreciated how she established the character, but her downfall as the movie progressed seemed too sudden, and lacked the proper motivation. Tommy Lee Jones plays a stereotypical outlaw-with-a-heart-of-gold character. I kind of appreciate some of the stuff he does in the film, and he certainly provides the only humor, which this movie needed. But I've seen this exact character so many times before, so he didn't stand out in any way.The story of The Homesman is quite depressing. I can take a movie that feels a little downbeat, but this was oppressively dire. They even include a number of flashbacks that are belaboring the trauma these girls have received. We get the point after the first sequence with each of them, so going back over it just feels like needless ugly indulgence. The ending, which in most movies like this would be where the story has that uplifting sense of hope, was also lacking. This ending was made worse by what might be one of the worst performances I've ever seen from Meryl Streep, as she seems to have completely missed the tone of the entire film. Also, there is a cameo from Hailee Steinfeld at the end that was awkward and made me uncomfortable. A movie that starts so bleak and ends without improving much on that tone is a miss for me. While there were some promising moments in The Homesman, and it had a decent premise, I was disappointed with the final product."
" Plains, yes - Plain, no (miscast lead)
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,7,"I have to praise the acting and visceral impact of this film, but the theme of the lead female character being ""plain"" was a case of miscasting. Have you seen photos of Ms. Swank on the beach, etc? She has a bit of a strong jaw but is hardly dull to look at.I suppose her lack of makeup was part of it, but the men who refused her were not in some league above! The interactions seemed staged in that regard. Another actress with no shape and a truly harsh face would have made it more plausible.There's also a thread of extreme callousness throughout, but it comes off as realistic for those harsh times, given what we know of human nature.P.S. I wonder if the film crew had to edit out wind turbines or oil rigs from vista shots? Wide open spaces uncluttered by machines are increasingly rare."
" A bit disappointed
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,6,"I love Tommy Lee Jones' first directorial effort, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, and yet I still waited several years to turn on The Homesman, his follow up.I hate to say it, but my hopes of having another great actor turned director (like Clint Eastwood) may be a bit dashed. It's not so much that Jones' second film is bad, but that it feels surprisingly inconsistent.The opening is a bit confusing. He juggles images of four women, three of whom are going through different stages of insanity, and the fourth, Hillary Swank, struggling to expand her roots in the territory with a husband. Her suitor rejects her. A visit by the local pastor and a meeting establishes the plot at that point. The three other women must be transported back to Iowa and then back to their original homes. The harsh winter has driven them irrevocably insane. Swank essentially volunteers, picks up Jones to help (saving him from the noose), and they're off.The problem is really something wouldn't be an issue on subsequent viewings, but on a first viewing it's hard to discern what the point of the first act is while in it. It's largely wordless (especially around the three women), which is fine if it were handled better. Still, on a second viewing, there would be far less confusion.The second act is mostly fine. There's good character work, especially between Swank and Jones. The three women, oddly enough, begin to clarify a bit the further they get from their territory homes. There are just some jarring cuts from one scene to the next, like when a group of Indians appear on a ridge and they have to deal with that situation. The cut is so swift from the last scene to the danger that it's a bit hard to digest.I became sold on the movie, though, at one point at the turn of the 2nd to 3rd acts. Swank does something that I should have expected to some degree, meaning that it was entirely within her character to do it and she was in a situation that almost called for it, but I didn't expect it at the same time. The images are very strong around it and the emotion is clear and effective.However, the movie continues with an odd scene around James Spader in an isolated hotel as he waits for investors to arrive and won't feed and clothe the party. Jones ends up torching the building and murdering four people. The conversations that lead to that action feel wrong. There's just something off about it, and then the reaction of the burning felt so out of proportion to the original refusal, especially with the lack of any attempt at accommodation on either side, that it just left an unpleasant taste in my mouth.Still, the movie straddles the line between good and less than good. I was prepared to label it good, but the more I thought about the ending, the less I felt inclined to provide a recommendation on the movie as a whole. I wanted to like it more than I do. There's genuinely good stuff there, especially performance wise and that one plot turn with Swank, but the movie as a whole just doesn't hold up as well as it should, which is a small disappointment."
" Journey through madness
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,8,"What could go wrong when three schizophrenic women are escorted on a perilous journey from Nebraska to Iowa by a lonely spinster and a reluctant drifter?One heck of a journey riddled with scenes of mental breakdown, absconsion, self-harm, arson, murder and suicide.Not knowing the cultural history of the period/region, I shall refrain from commenting on that.Instead, I see this as a take on madness, in which the so-called sane duo, the spinster and the drifter, appear on various occasions to be madder than the three women they are escorting; it is difficult to say which of the duo is madder than the other. There are no good or bad characters here, just varying shades of grey.The three women, as I perceived them, display varying traits of schizophrenia - the Danish woman is schizomanic and has grandiose delusions, another woman has thought disorder and utters nothing other than 'Tha... tha...', and the youngest one appears catatonic with prolonged staring spells.The spinster, though strong-willed, is desperate for male company, and propositions every passing male to marry her. She even compels the drifter, several years older than herself, to 'keep her honour'.The very next day she hangs herself, literally and figuratively abandoning her journey. It's almost as though her life is finished after her union with the drifter, which flies in the face of any purported feminist notion.The odd drifter becomes odder towards the end of the film as he goes on a murderous spree and dances away on the river, even as the gravestone he got made for the spinster's grave falls into the river.An allegory of madness that shows that while the three mentally ill women eventually reach their safe haven, the outside world continues to play host to many more suicidal spinsters and eccentric drifters.A great cinematic moment when one of my favourites, Meryl Streep, in a cameo appearance, shares screen-space with her real life daughter, Grace Gummer. Also, I would have liked a longer screen-time for my other favourite, John Lithgow.Overall, a disturbing but engaging watch."
" Harsh Times for Pioneers
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,7,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie even though it was bleak and unbearable to watch at times. Life was extremely difficult and harsh, and the movie depicted the hardships throughout. The acting was superb, and each character completely fulfilled his role. Tommy Lee Jones was excellent as expected. I'm glad that I was born in the 20th century because I am not cut out for the pioneer life. Thank goodness they paved the way for us."
" The Homesman
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,7,"I remember seeing the trailer for this film on a DVD, and some months later it was broadcast on television, I was attracted to it mainly because of the stars, it was rated well and had a good sounding plot, I was looking forward to it. Basically Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) is a spinster from New York, a former teacher who journeyed to the Midwest for more opportunity. She lives in the small farming community of Loup in the Nebraska Territory, and has significant financial prospects and sizable land ownership. She seems strong and independent but suffers from depression and feels isolated. She makes dinner for her neighbour Bob Giffen (Evan Jones), she later proposes they get married, but he turns her down saying she is ""plain, and too bossy"", he then leaves. After a harsh winter, three women from the community begin to show signs of mental instability due to hardships they have suffered. Arabella Sours (Grace Gummer) has lost three children to diphtheria, Theoline Belknap (Miranda Otto) kills her own child after her family risks starvation, and Danish immigrant Gro Svendsen (Sonja Richter) has an abusive husband and has a breakdown after her mother dies. Reverend Alfred Dowd (John Lithgow) calls a town meeting asking someone to escort the women eastward to a church in Hebron, Iowa that cares for the mentally ill. Most of the men refuse to participate to determine who will escort the women, Cuddy proposes that she does it, and eventually they all agree. While preparing for her journey, Cuddy encounters George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones, also writing and directing), a claim jumper, who has been lynched and is in a noose on a horse for stealing. Briggs begs Cuddy for help, scared of the journey ahead she frees him, on the condition that he helps her to escort the three women. He immediately casts doubt on the job and insists he be free to abandon her at any time, Cuddy tells him that $300 awaits him on their arrival in Iowa, but she secretly keeps it with her. Briggs's experience comes in handy when the group crosses paths with hostile natives. This includes an incident where Arabella is kidnapped by a Freighter (Tim Blake Nelson), there is a violent scuffle, it ends when Arabella kills the kidnapper. They stop on the journey to repair a grave desecrated by Indians, Cuddy stays to do so while Briggs insists on pushing on, she loses her way but eventually catches up. Cuddy is distraught following her wandering in the desert and getting lost, she suggests to Briggs getting married, like previous men he refuses to do so. Later that night, a naked Cuddy propositions him, and despite his initial protesting, the two have sex. Waking up late the next morning, Briggs finds that Cuddy has hanged herself. Briggs chastises Sours, Belknapp, and Svendsen, blaming their illness for Cuddy's death as he buries her body. He discovers that she had the $300 with her the whole time, and so takes a horse and abandons the three women. However, the trio surprisingly follow him on foot, Arabella is almost drowned chasing him across a river, Briggs saves her and decides to continue taking the three of them to Iowa. Briggs seeks food and shelter at an empty hotel belonging to Aloysius Duffy (James Spader), he informs him that they are expecting guests, and letting the women stay would sour the establishment. There is a brief stand-off between Briggs and Duffy, Briggs leaves, but returns that night to set fire to the hotel, taking a suckling pig to feed himself and the women before leaving, apart from the cook who Briggs sent away, all inside are burned alive. Briggs reaches Hebron, passing the women into the care of Altha Carter (Meryl Streep), the wife of the church's reverend, he informs her of Cuddy's death but does not disclose the true cause. Feeling guilty for rejecting Mary Bee's proposal, he has a wooden slab engraved with her name and plans to mark her grave with it. He meets hard-working young maid Tabitha Hutchinson (Hailee Steinfeld) and later proposes to her, advising her not to marry some young man going west and to stay in town, she answers ""maybe"". He then boards a ferry heading back west and starts singing a rowdy song with two musicians on board, he is told to stop by people at the pier, he chastises them, then returns to singing as the ferry departs, and Mary Bee's marker goes into the river. Also starring David Dencik as Thor Svendsen, William Fichtner as Vester Belknap, Barry Corbin as Buster Shaver, Jesse Plemons as Garn Sours, Jo Harvey Allen as Mrs. Polhemus and Caroline Lagerfelt as Netti Svendsen. Jones is good as the shady old man with mixed reactions to the job in hand, Swank is pretty good as the troubled single woman, the three females acting as quiet and crazy do well, and there are some good performances from the supporting cast. It is an interesting story of a journey across the wilderness set during the 19th century American frontier, it has been a long while since there has been a good film in this well-established genre, the script is well put together, the period detail is splendid, and there are some memorable moments of action and emotion, overall it is a worthwhile western. Very good!"
" Awful
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,1,"What a terrible movie. It starts out with a strong, smart woman and ends with Tommy Lee Jones acting like an idiot. There are so many positive parts that then go completely haywire, that I couldn't believe Tommy Lee actually wrote it. He should fire his film editor. The ending is so off, I was kicking myself for watching the entire movie. You think Tommy Lee is going to redeem himself and the movie, and it instead ends with him drunk and dancing and forgetting the mission he gave himself. The fact that Hillary Swank hangs herdelf because no one will marry her/she can't get a man is stupid. Women in pioneer times didn't do that.Don't waste your time."
" Beware! This can suck you in but it collapses disastrously.
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,3,"This whole thing is spoilers really - as other reviews demonstrate, if you get to caring about the Swank character, you will be hugely disappointed, even hurt by this and it's one case where it might be worth knowing what you're getting into. It's written by, produced by, directed by and starring Tommy Lee Jones and therein lies the problemThe start doesn't make a whole lot of sense. A bunch of frontier women (only women) simultaneously go mad and have to be taken back east. Meanwhile Hilary Swank is too 'plain' for any man to marry her. Just take a look at her photo on the video cover and compare her with the married women of the community to see how ridiculous that is. Then it starts to build some steam. Her strong character (""You're as much of a man as any man around here,"" says the local preacher) takes charge and volunteers to do a job which none of the men can handle. She rescues Jones' character from being hanged and, despite knowing nothing about him, forces/bribes him to help her on the journey.So far this has been pretty good, OK bleak and not always believable but, as usual, Swank's performance is quite brilliant, Jones does his usual uninspiring but solid job and the supporting cast do fine. Jones is directing well too early on, pacing things nicely and building an authentic feel. We have plenty to hope for, a character to care about, and a testing journey in prospect. It all goes wrong when the travellers run across a little girl's desolate grave.Suddenly and for no reason the Swank character is transformed. She's been boss all along but now she's doing what Jones tells her, bursting into tears, then, absurdly, proposing marriage to this unreliable and somewhat decrepit old man and virtually forcing herself on him. The only explanation: she's crazier than the wagon-load of women she's supposed to be looking after. Next, forgetting her passionately-delivered promises to the relatives of those women, she kills herself. This goes beyond shaky and ridiculous to pointless and unbelievable and we realise that this is not Jones' take on a strong woman, but just another self-absorbed and self-centred vehicle for a writer-producer-director-star. In fact it went wrong earlier than that when the Jones character was introduced. After that he shows little interest in the plot or the other characters - everything is there only to provided the foils to his lead.I wasn't interested in Jones' rather dull and stereotyped playing of a dull, stereotyped character, nor in his self-absorption. I didn't watch any more, wished I'd never started watching in the first place and I hope this will help others avoid the same mistake."
" AMAZING, MUST-SEE PORTRAYAL.
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,9,"We (me, wife) watched it last night. What a wonderful film, everything seemed perfect. So moving, so touching. It is not a film made for commercial reasons but for truth."
" Days it stays with you~
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,9,"The acting is stellar. Storyline different than most, visually shocking and then sticks to your ribs. Hubby and I talked about it days later, then days later. Something so soul driven."
" Aggravating Strangeness
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,4,"This movie is by no means a typical Western by any sense of the genre is concerned at least when it comes to the plot, which is bizarre and leaves a lot to be answered.
Put it this way, just because a person likes westerns by no means makes this movie a shew in for 'gotta see'. There are some well filmed scenes however and Jones and Swank are as good as you'd expect them to be. All in all I wouldn't plan a night centering on watching this film."
" Outstanding Hilary Swank
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,9,"This is Hilary's finest acting in my opinion, Tommy Lee Jones has never disappoint.the direction, plot, and character is just simply outstanding."
" Worst Western I've ever seen!
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,1,"I love Hilary Swank and T.L. Jones is ok too. But this movie had a terrible ending. It's like waiting for the point but it never delivers! And the motives were awful. What a waist of time! Terrible, can't unwatch it now! Not to mention the horrible profanity and awkward scenes!
Can nobody make good westerns anymore??"
" WHO IS MARY BEE CUDDY?
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,8,"Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) is ""plain as an old tin pail"" and desires a husband. She has a successful prairie homestead in the community of Loup and is a strong and determined woman. After a bad winter, three of the women, go crazy. Their husbands won't or can't care for them and they are going to be taken back east and eventually reunited with family. Mary Bee is chosen to be the homesman, the person to take them back home. She employs the help of claim jumper George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) who says to her ""I can see why you are single.""The trip is long and arduous...like the movie. It does not follow the formula. In fact the trip doesn't start until 45 minutes into the film. Meryl Streep has a small role near the end of the feature. The film teaches us that there were lives and ""heroes"" unknown to us in this circa 1850 setting. George Briggs gives us a complex character...perhaps not as complex as Snape, but more realistic.Not your typical action western, more of an art indie western.Guide: No f-bombs. Brief scenes of sex, rape, nudity (Hilary Swank, Sonja Richter)"
" Cure to the Common Crazy
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,8,"As much as I love Westerns nowadays, I'm damn glad I don't live in those days.In this highly realistic, absolutely scary portrayal of frontier folk trying to figure out how to start life from almost scratch, we're given some thoroughly interesting aspects I hadn't thought of prior. Plus some great performances and interesting choices in cinematography.Boys Don't Cry, but they do occasionally lead some women who have completely lost it cross-country back to Iowa in the 1850s. Million Dollar Baby thinks she can do it on her own, but she'll need the help of one-half Men in Black as her guide, strong arm and as the Director. It AIN'T gonna be easy.I haven't always loved Westerns, but I have in my olden years and I'm always searching for that next great one. This one was so close. It had so many editing issues that it was hard to, literally, put the pieces together. Also could've been cut shorter as there were a ton of redundancies and irrelevant shots.That all said, this was a FINE Western with solid performances and twists and turns I never predicted. Plus it felt so genuine, it's nice to see how it was really like back then.Definitely recommended for Western Fans.***Final thoughts: Now curious about the book. Sounds like an interesting read."
" Extremely well done, just a hard subject
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,5,"Great acting/directing. Just a very hard subject in some very hard times. Wouldn't want to live it, so didn't really enjoy watching it. But the movie was extremely well done."
" Cute period piece, but.
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,4,"Great cinematography and music. Acting was reasonable, and the story had great potential. 
With the list of A-list stars I was hoping for a bit more to the story. 
Would have been a 6 or so, but the outlandish and out of place scene with James Spader, towards the end kind of killed it for me.
Could have been a great theme of every human having value despite issues, but story fell short and not even A-listers could save it. 
Towards the end even the actors seemed to lose conviction in their story telling. 
Finally at the end, the laser-cut perfectly straight modern font on a wooden tombstone kinda demonstrates the lackluster effort the producers put into making the story believable."
" Never gets better!
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,3,"What do actors do when they are bored yet want to indulge their passion. They produce a movie that no one else would touch because it offers no real storyline, no pleasantness, no hope; in fact this movie is a journey into the abyss. There is nothing outstanding about anyone's performance in this movie. Don't waste your life watching."
" Dreadful
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,2,"Such a disappointent. Film makers cannot make good westerns anymore and this is a lazy, illogical, depressing, low budget effort, and in an attempt to make itself realistic succeeds in being almost totally unrealistic. Even the horrible Bone Tomahawk was better and that DVD was literally thrown out of my house. Don't bother.There is a much better detailed and accurate review of this rubbish elsewhere."
" Well, it was watchable
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,2,"A first for me. Never thought a movie could go from a depressing note... to the next depressing note .... and the next , and the next... and... even end on a depressing note.Go go now. Got to do something to cheer me up. Bye"
" Falls Apart
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,5,"This movie had potential and starts off strong......then it just falls apart.SPOILERS!Are we really to believe that Mary would suddenly want to disrobe and have sex with George out in the cold with the mentally ill women watching? Are we then to believe she would suddenly hang herself? She was the one with the commitment to getting the women to Iowa and she suddenly kills herself? Why? Because she did the dirty? Really makes no sense at all and things just go downhill from there.Also, you really don't get the feeling that there was a strong bond between Mary and George anyway......this sudden love and respect seems to come out of nowhere.Could have been a good movie....but it's not."
" Harsh, gritty look at early life on the prairie.
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,8,"I grabbed this off the shelf at the rental store just because it had Tommy in it.It is NOT your typical western. It is NOT a feel good movie.I really had to think about what to write here, it was hard for me because this movie is so different. At one point I said, ""Forget it"".The movie opens with a woman plowing with two mules. We are introduced to a hardy single woman named Mary Bee Cuddy. She has a very nice homestead with sturdy buildings, a secure home and several animals. I still am curious why it didn't tell us how she managed that but it is not critical to what follows. Life on the prairie can drive you mad. The harshness, the lack of rain so no food grows, the animals you depended on die, what's a person to do? For some, it meant a broken spirit and just retreating into a catatonic state. For others it became lashing out and snarling like a wild animal.Three of the wives in the vicinity have gone mad and need to be transported to a place where they can be cared for. Mary Bee Cuddy steps up and offers to make the 4-5 week trip over harsh terrain and God knows what kind of weather or hostile people one might meet in 1850's Nebraska. This being since none of the men were willing to do it.She finds Briggs on a horse, noose about the neck left for dead by vigilantes. She convinces him he must help her transport the three women or she will leave him where he is. Thus begins a strained, unusual partnership. They endure cold nights and run out of food. It is not explained why they didn't pack more food, so that is a bit of a plot hole but it adds to a situation later on. Briggs is rebuffed by the owner of a hotel where he pleads for mercy on the woman, just some food and one nights stay. But they have wealthy investors coming so no, they must leave. Briggs goes back for food late and night and wreaks a horrid vengeance on the heartless owner.Briggs mentions he was the army, talks of Kiowa raids that ran off about 300 horses. So they tracked the Kiowa down, killed all of them and stampeded the horses through the Kiowa village most likely killing women and children. Briggs doesn't mention women and children but we suspect it happened. Later we learn he stole a horse and deserted. Even though he is a crusty, rugged man, we are left wondering if the stampede was too much for his conscience. Later he risks his life approaching a band of Native Americans who have rifles and bows. Knowing they are greatly out numbered he walks toward them with a horse and offers it in the hope they will leave satisfied. Prior to that, he gave his six shot pistol to Mary and told her to get in the wagon with the three women. If the native people do not accept his offer, she is to shoot the other women and then herself to spare them from possible torture. You seldom see that in a western. But it is another reminder of how harsh life was back then.They have numerous trials, ups and downs, and after a situation hard to comprehend, Mary Bee Cuddy hangs herself. As Tommy is digging her grave he is constantly ranting at the three ""crazy women"" which gives us a bit of insight as to what happened to Mary. It really jolts the viewer to have such a turn of events. Mary was so strong, so independent we came to imagine her going home to become an exceptionally successful lady.Briggs finally makes it to the place in Iowa where he leaves the three women. He buys a very nice tombstone for Mary which demonstrates his deep respect for her. The early Briggs would have ridden away with no thought, the same as he ripped the buffalo hide off the dead Native American who was wrapped and placed on a platform. He buys a pair of shoes for a barefoot young lady who works at the hotel where he was staying. As he heads back across the river on a raft, his tombstone for Mary gets pushed off and disappears. We see him dancing to banjo music and the movie ends.We are left with so many questions. Did he chase after the tombstone? Not likely, it was dark the odds of him finding it are slim.Did he return to her homestead? Not likely, he said he had no patience for farming. Then it occurred to me he left the mules with the pastors wife.But there he was dancing away as if he had not one care in the world. Did he simply return to being a vagabond? We'll never know.Again it is NOT a feel good movie, it makes you ask questions, it shows you how hard life was in the early days of the west. Some people will shut this off after only a few minutes because it doesn't fit the usual pattern, but if you are patient and keep watching, waiting for the plot to develop you just might gain some insight into the human mind and why people do the things they do."
" An excellent feature to illustrate why I don't like old West (rental)
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,7,"As a well stuffed European couch potato, I like my comfort! So to be trow back in the Frontier time, it's for me like being punished: it's bare, made of old craps, already old when it's new, dusty, and for sure, out of law and left to gun power! A bit like Marty in BTTF3, I don't think I could manage more than a week in that world However a lot of anonymous families, men as women and even children made it with their sweat, blood and life but are sadly today totally forgotten! Now I can hear only about Manifest destiny, glorious battles and names so a movie like this put the things back into their right place! Hilary chooses one more time a challenging and unexpected job compared to all other Hollywood actresses who prefer to stay in conventional and easy characters A bit like when she was Bradon, she does here a man job but with no joy to enjoy life just because she wants to prove her quality to be a good wife!Honestly I never liked too much TLJ but year after year, movies after movies, he walks on the same righteous path, always deliver steady and decent acting so he manages to convince me. In addition, I found him an inspired director as he has a good eye for framing his movie, with a lot of clean symmetry and simplicity So between a old west version of Lynch Straight Story and a Bridge for Therabitia for a certain psychological shock, this hard, cruel movie is still a recommendation"
" Less to see than is promised
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,5,"'The Homesman' is a Western that depart from standard plotting; indeed, its title at first appears strange, as the eponymous ""homesman"" appears to be only a secondary character. While I generally like films that move in unexpected directions, however, it's hard to sympathise with the homesman as a central character. One must also wonder if Hilary Swank, a perfectly attractive woman by any normal standards, gets tired of playing ""irredemably unfeminine"" in Hollywood, while Meryl Streep has a strange cameo in a role so uninteresting it seems wholly bizarre she was cast in it. The film certainly doesn't romanticise life on the range; the contrast between wild Nebraska and civilised Iowa may, however, be overdone, and its presentation of mental illness is really rather primitive. Ultimately, Swank's character is the only one with depth, and the movie loses its focus once it turns away from her."
" Life is neither good nor bad, it just is.
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,9,"With a solid cast and a first class performance from Hilary Swank The Homesman is closer to grasp life in the Midwest as it really was better than most films I have ever seen. Dear viewer we must acknowledge that bad things happen, and we tend to think well now that something bad has happen something good has to follow, as if life was keeping track of our scores ready to compensate us for the bad blows. Sadly that's not the case.If you are looking for a story with a happy ending Hollywood style The Homesman is not for you, you have been warned. But if you want to put on the shoes of people from a time and place that you will never know and feel like you've been there, felt the frightening vastness of that territory and the terrifying fragility of life, then come along, even if it's not a happy time it will unquestionably be authentic and true-to-life as you will ever see on a western.And still if you look close enough you will find kindness, and that string of hope that we need to keep going.Enjoy."
" Half a good movie.
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,5,"The Homesman starts out with a clear sense of direction, and it maintains that direction for the first hour. Then a strange and unwarranted turn of events throw the movie off track and the last several scenes rob it any integrity or meaning. It gets to where it was supposed to go, minus any climax or resolution. What we are left with is little more than a two hour cue card lesson about some of the Unkindness of the Frontier.The premise involves Swank volunteering to transport three crazed widows across miles of unsettled land to a hospital. She employs Jones as a body guard in exchange for saving him from the noose Though somewhat heavy in mannerism, Hilary Swank gives a strong performance, as does Tommy Lee Jones. Swank is battling some inner emotional turmoil that earns our sympathy, so when the script writes her out in a contrived manner, we are left feeling dumbfounded. Jones is left to finish the job, but the movie fails to showcase his personal investment, or give us a reason why he would bother. There is a creepy and grizzly scene where he resorts to arson in order to steal food for his harem. When he reaches the end of his journey he is welcomed by a curiously cast Merryl Streep playing a relatively flat, five minute role that is far from top billing. There is nothing formally wrong with her performance, its just that her reputation is overwhelms the scene. It would be similar like watching Justin Bieber play at a retirement home. She and Jones have a nice exchange and then the movie ends on a bizarre and emotionally void note that reminds us that all the proceedings have amounted to virtually nothing. It started as one picture and ends as another."
" Beware! This can suck you in but it collapses disastrously.

" Brilliant with Swank and Lee Jones together!
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,8,"I honestly thought the pair of them did pretty good performances as their characters. Mind you, I thought this movie was really sad because their characters were bringing three women who weren't able to look after themselves anymore and Swank's character commits suicide. The fact,Tommy Lee Jones' character got a customised grave head from the town he bought the three women in and then an ignorant man pushed it through the river, made it really gut wrenching. I wish that wasn't including in the ending, I would've rathered if we saw him jump into the river and got it even if he was suppose to be drunk. That would've been a better ending than that to be honest.....At least he got the three women safe and sound with Meryl Streep's character despite their horrible journey.This movie was well done but very very sad, I give this a rating of 8/10!!!!!!!!!!"
" Decent but too slow, even for a Western
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,6,"'The Homesman' is a decent enough, well-written Western drama that is everything you expect it to be, but it had the potential to be a lot better. The film has an expensive appearance and the cinematography is excellent, with some great attention to detail.The film also features a strong cast including Meryl Streep and the talented Hailee Steinfeld, who seems to fill these roles in Westerns perfectly. The problems with 'The Homesman' start with the pacing, which feels way too slow, even for a Western. The ending is also unnecessarily drawn out, adding very little to the film.The plot, whilst interesting enough to hold your attention, never really takes off and feels somewhat shallow. All in all, 'The Homesman' met my expectations, but I'm still left somewhat disappointed that it didn't do anything more. I think it had the potential to be much better."
" Movie sucks
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,1,Just another formula movie skip it.Meryl Streep is just phoning it in for another paycheck.People like Streep should just retire and change jobs.I think her political views are hurting her acting.She should just shut up and act.
" Just Because It's A Western Doesn't Mean It Has To Be So Bleak
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,4,"While westerns are not my all-time favorite genre, when one is well down I can enjoy it thoroughly. With what seemed like an interesting story, along with the casting of Tommy Lee Jones & Hilary Swank, I figured this would be a classic. Sadly, it seems as if the producers were more concerned about telling the bleakest story possible than they were about focusing on plot points or any certain themes.For a basic plot summary, ""The Homesman"" sees Mary Bee Cuddy (Swank) recruited by the local parish to transport three ""crazy"" (mentally ill) women across the plains to where they can receive help. Though seemingly an impossible task, Cuddy stumbles upon George Briggs (Jones), a man about to be hanged. Before she rescues him, she makes him promise to help her on her journey.Let me start with what I liked about the film: Jones's performance is truly amazing, and (IMHO) he pretty much carried the film. Even in the spots that didn't emotionally draw me in, Jones's authenticity saved the day on a number of occasions. Swank also played a solid role, but I wish her character would have been given more story/attention (in other words, I think her acting was very much limited by the script). Also, I liked how this movie represented the starkness of the Old West. This isn't a rah-rah cowboys vs. Indians flick in any sense of the imagination. It tries to be as real as possible.That ""realism"", however, ends up being the downfall of the picture. There are so many interesting tangents that could have been explored throughout the film, but instead they are discarded in favor of the bleak landscape and sometimes shocking crudity of the times. It's almost like the film-makers purposely put all their efforts into creating a shockingly gritty western but forgot along the way that without a flesh-out story it isn't going to succeed.Here are a few examples where I felt the film fell short of its potential mark (MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD...DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM!)...-Why exactly were the women so crazy? The explanation is supposed to be ""because pioneer life is so tough"", but I didn't buy into that. I needed a little more backstory on them. -Where were they being taken for help? Maybe I missed something, but what was the point of this big adventure anyway? Were the women going to be treated by a doctor? Very anti-climactic in that sense. -When Cuddy meets her end (I won't say how), there is (or at least was to me) an implication that she was also crazy. I wished those themes could have been expanded on as well.To be honest, the only thing I kept this from being a single-star effort for me was Tommy Lee Jones. Even when the ending left me a bit confused and disappointed, his standout emotional performance gave me at least something to care about. Other than that, though, I was severely disappointed at why the movie had to insist on being so bleak in storytelling. All the material was there...it just wasn't allowed to come out."
