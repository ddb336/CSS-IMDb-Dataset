" Decent Movie
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,8,"The people that give this a low rating are the people that would ask for pickles on their sandwich knowing they don't like them then complain about the sandwich being nasty... The lowest I would give this movie would be a 7, and that's if I'm being extremely picky!This is not a zombie movie or a horror film, it's a thriller, and a slow burn one at that! The suspense is great leading up to the action scenes, and the flashbacks are placed good and not to long, with a bigger budget and cast this movie could of been a real gem but it's fine as it is, I recommend checking it out!"
" Movie vith a ""twist""?
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,6,"Can it be called a twist when the ""twist"" is predictable more or less from the beginning of the movie?? But despite a predictable twist/""twist"", this movie is still worth a watch. Technically it is well made, the acting is between good and great (especially ""Zoe"" is great in my opinion!). The script was good if you look past the aforementioned predictable ""twist"", and despite my hunch regarding the ""twist"" I still had my doubts during the movie, so watching it did not completely miss suspension even if it is a slow burner. I would characterize approximately 4/5 of ""Hidden"" as a ""suspenseful drama"" more than a ""horror"" movie if that makes any sense before watching this movie, perhaps more or less like ""Bird Cage"" and at least one other movie that I can not mention without revealing too much..."
" Decent movie
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,7,"For a family trying to remain hidden, they sure do make a lot of noise. The daughter is borderline just annoying."
" The worst film you will ever see
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,1,"Everything this is about this film is annoying, especially the girl!!! If you want to be irritated and annoyed then this film is for you. Do not worst time literally anything is better than this. I can't think of one good thing about it!"
" Solid plot, twist and acting minus ""Zozo""
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,6,"Overall worth watching if you can phase out the child actor Zoe. I know child acting can be hit or miss and try to give it the benefit of the doubt. But this was pretty brutal. Constantly overacting, and scripting makes it seem like she's the main character.
Other acting was great, movie premise and final twist was very interesting/captivating. However, combination of Zoe going over the top screaming and too much script for her ruined a lot of scenes and detracted from the suspense. Otherwise would be an 8/10. Similar to 10 clover field lane."
" Nice twist but nothing special
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,6,"It's probably not the wisest idea I've ever had , to watch a film about a deadly virus while I'm struggling to breath with COVID-19 but I did and I can't say it did a great deal for me.This is the story of a family who takes refuge in a bomb shelter after a disease outbreak, to avoid a the people above ground called the breathers .Apart from a nice , but predictable twist three quarters from the end , this really wasn't up to much .
It felt a little bit like a Stephen King short story but not quite up to King's standard.The biggest problem I had with this film was not the plot but the little girl.
Whoever was playing her was over acting terribly and when she was crying it looked so false . I suppose playing alongside Andrea Riserborough and Alexander Starsgard didn't help.Hidden is so unremarkable it should remain what it's title says."
" A nice little find
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,7,More of a solid 7 than a 6.4 if you ask me. If you like this kinda genre then this is a nice little find! Enjoy!
" Waste of my time
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,3,"This movie was just downright depressing.
Frankly if I had been living life in a dirty fall out shelter with no light I think I'd just let them kill me.
If I had to listen to the mom call Zoe Zoe-zo one more time I would have impaired my ears with sharp pencils.
Too much screaming from the kid, no wonder they were found.
And of course kids never listen to their parents.
I give it a 3 because of the plot twist at the end but for the most part I struggled to stay awake and focused.
I guess if you have absolutely nothing else to watch, and I mean even reruns of FRIENDS, than you might be mildly entertained. I wasn't
Come to think of it it's more of a 2 for me."
" A Family, A Shelter and The Rules
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,8,"😱First Impressions:
In all honesty, the cover of the film unnecessarily gives out more details than it should. You may have heard of it before in bigger budget films- family is trapped during a post-apocalyptic scenario. But this film did something those would never have dreamed of~
Pros:
😋 Stellar performances; Alexander is the standout followed by a tie with his on-screen wife and daughter (hear me out). You can almost their familial bond and long-established rapport.😋 Some mentioned the daughter as a big minus to
the film enjoyment and I definitely see why- but that's precisely the point. It's about seeing things from a child's perspective and of course actually has to do with a significant aspect of the narrative. Hence the coaxing scenes; which were the best, heartfelt parts.Cons:
😪 The camera work was phenomenal but at some point it just spiralled out of control and certain parts the tension was already visible, palpable. But the so-called framing of the scenes actually eased me out more so than drew me in... It felt like artistic, creative angles then proper set up of scares.😪 The end; I appreciate the message of the film. It's about hope, isolation (something which bears a resemblance to COVID, imagine if this was out 2020). But the choice of affliction they chose was just a way of adding needless action sequences. It could have been more subtle after all the effort they made to craft a highly anxiety, hair-raising psychological horror.
😇 Verdict 😈
One of the gems that sadly has burrowed way too deep for me to only discover it today- literally. Don't let some reviews fool you and ruin your judgement of the girl (seriously). Going in blind is best~ A psychological horror film on par with its more famous counterparts like Birdbox or A Quiet Place. It has subtlety and the small setting only helped its cause for immersion, character development."
" Bad start bad ending, low light movie
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,4,"I dont know why so many positive reviews really the movie had so much potential but noo, in fast words bad start, bad ending and no explanation at least a little realism"
" An original
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,8,"""Hidden"" is slow paced movie with only three characters most of the time. It is more or less film for emotions and feelings of the family which lives in fear and uncertainty. The mood of the film is not artificially tense and there is no horrors only to scare the viewer.
The acting of young Emily Alyn Lind is superb! I recommend this film to people who are interested in genre and would like something more than the usual pattern of infection/zombies/we will all die."
" Never lose control!
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,10,A smart and unsettling horror story with a dramatic twist!
" Zombies? Who told you it's about zombies? Take a deep ""breath"", because YOU are the threat here!
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,10,"Okay so where do I start?!! I'm so excited this is my very first review on an official movie website! First off, why a 10? Authentic, unique story. Incredible realism and truly professional actor play. I just finished watching it for the second time and now I see why it was rated R, why I totally fell in love with Hidden : the directors kept the focus on what they wanted to show and tell. This is a very serious movie finally without any lazy scary teen scenes or off moments. You either watch it or you don't...and let me tell you if you do, you're in for one hell of an ending! The emotion goes up into the stratosphere, the outcome is at it's darkest and nothing is predictable until the very end. This twisted beyond imagination of a thriller is pure gold after all the deceiving outbreak flicks I have seen in over a decade. The main plot has been told a hundred times before...but there will always be only one Hidden in my heart! It's refreshing, unlike anything I have ever seen and maybe unlike anything I will ever see. It did for the genre what Manhattan Undying did for vampires. The effort behind this little gem is so honest and straight forward. You can't possibly ignore all the work, all the love behind such a simple concept to make it so damn mindblowing! I raise my hat way up in the air to the team and actors. You guys did something frankly amazing and you can be proud of it! And between you and me, there is no other way...THERE HAS TO BE A SEQUEL!!! Let's make it happen people!...forgot to say... (spoiler)...for once you not only feel fear or astonishment when the bombs come down on their little town...you feel pain and sadness. It squeezes something inside, that's how much I got attached to the characters. And I have known Raccoon City since 2002...never dropped a tear for them! XD"
" One of the best movies of this kind
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,8,"It was a really good movie. Amazing twist at the end. Even though it is slow sometimes, it makes you wonder all the time about the outside world. The way they built the story, with all the suspense, made it worth watching."
" Different zombie movie...!!!
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,6,"A family stay in bomb shelter for one year to get protect from something...finally it reveals in climax..
Nice slow burning thriller..."
" Dark, Yes - TOO Dark
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,3,"I don't normally rate movies - I more rarely rate bad movies. This might not be a bad movie (as I assess from my fellow ""reviewers"") - it might actually be a good movie. I don't know. I know the sound is just fine. I observed the credits with adequate illustration. Not so much the actual photography, which is, IMO, a key ingredient of any moving picture.For 80% of the ""film"" - those parts except the very vague ""flashbacks"" - this production is, in fact, an old-fashioned radio show. I see nothing on screen except vague shadows. Still, the sound is robust. Lots of action in the crunching and roaring and screaming and yelling - and even a bit in the more tender moments - all shadow-play.Why make a movie without LIGHTING??? Don't waste your time. Unless you want to listen rather than watch-and-listen."
" Solid concept, annoying character
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed the concept and the isolating feel of the film. The whole time your trying to figure out who these creatures are and what they want.
The pros are almost outweighed by the annoying little girl's character. I thought there girl's acting was great but the character was so obnoxious. She wouldn't shut the heck up for one second. She's taught to keep quiet in order to survive but she was so loud and cried every five minutes. I honestly wanted to shut the film off because of it. Not only that, but her need to interject stupidly all the time felt pointless. Instead of the parents doubling down in ensuring she knows her role for survival, they catered to her every question and babied every sad expression she made. Your sitting there thinking that this is no time for Mickey mouse b.s. this is the time to shut up and stay alive.
Honestly, this movie would be great if the kid's character was cut or they made her not the center of the movie.Five stars because I liked the concept and the overall plot line but hated the kid."
" ""Stay Home""
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,7,"Bizarre but unique and creepy little film about a family of three who take refuge in an underground bunker after a catastrophic epidemic. This is a slow burn, with flashbacks as we steadily learn what's going on. All three of the actors are good (Alexander Skarsgård) and its almost exclusively just them. Eventually the family must venture out into the world, populated by monstrous ""breathers"" in order to replenish their dwindling supplies and that's when the twist comes into play, which makes you examine the whole movie in a new way.Notes: Quarantine warnings on the road signs, significant and kinda freaky because that's what I'm seeing on the roads here, right now, ""Stay Home.""
I definitely would have taught my young daughter to be quiet, like no questions asked. Full stop.
I would have removed the dolls voice box day one."
" Part 2 pls or mini series!!!
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,10,Please make part two or make into mini series there is so much more that can come from this movie I loved it.
" Excellent film...
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,10,Had you misled the entire time. Great story and an excellent film score too.
" Slow to start - Plot twist worth it
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,7,"Slow build up. Felt like it needed sticking with for the first half an hour but the plot twist is one that is rarely seen and makes it a good film. Improvements could be made but worth watching for sure. Not a ""scary"" horror."
" This is good!
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,9,"Very interesting story line.
You are in for a big surprise here!
Maybe you think its boring to watch three people in a very small room underground. But it is very interesting, and you are on the edge of your seat the whole time.
This is a very good movie"
" This is a 1/10 idk why the high score
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,1,"Slow burn dull movie, they make you wait an eternity for finally revealing the most dumb childish laughable plot twist ever, is an insult to the time invested by the viewer!
So unless you are a special education 12yo kid who gets easily scared, AVOID!"
" Cracking entertainment
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Thoroughly enjoyed. Invested in the characters, plenty of suspense and thrills, kept you guessing, with great ending. Proper film entertainment. Not Chekhov, but not meant to be."
" Amazing!
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,8,"A well-done mix of horror and thriller.
The plot is twisted in a way that keeps watching till the unexpected end."
" good
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,7,Good movie to pass some time. Not sure about the monsters! odd in parts. slow burn right enough. not sure what else to say really.
" They couldn't feel how light the canned peaches were?
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,6,"This movie's got some good points and some bad points. Firstly, I'd say the acting is pretty good, especially Zoe, considering her age. Seeing her and her father interacting always made for good scenes (especially when contrasted with her mother, who for whatever reason was written to be incredibly frustrating at times).There's a few small nit-picks but those don't really matter. The majority of the movie was quite good, especially since most of it took place in one small bunker. So much so that the ending actually was a bit of a let down.Having the family turn out to be infected was interesting, but calling the military ""breathers"" didn't really make any sense, since everyone, including the little girl, knew that the government was trying to kill them. Obviously this is only to hide the twist from the audience. I will say though, that the gas masks and yellow lights did make you wonder who or what exactly these enemies were.The family turning into crazed monsters was silly, as was the underground society where these monsters could truly ""be themselves."" Nonetheless, I sure didn't expect that for an ending.I'd recommend the movie, despite its cheesy qualities.And seriously, how did Zoe not realize that the giant can of peaches she was opening, was completely empty?"
" Clever to a fault
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,5,"Okay, so the three main characters have the disease the whole time, but we only find out in the final act of the film. Why does this bug me? Why do I find my self repeating my little mantra that artists shouldn't lie to their audiences? Is it some sort of personal thing with me? No, not really. It's because the effort put into maintaining the trick ends up creating a weird experience that doesn't take full advantage of the situation created.So, telling this story in order, a plague breaks out that turns people into violent, strong, murder monsters. Our three characters, a small family, try to escape their little town bordered in by cliffs, only to be turned back by the military as they try to leave. They then see the military bomb the town and kill most of the people trying to escape with them. They miraculously get into a bunker hidden under the elementary school filled with food and hang out there for three hundred days, when the movie actually begins. They are, of course, infected, but they won't actually address this fact, or that the people outside trying to kill them are the military, directly because that would give the game away to the audience. Instead, they talk about rules for keeping control of their emotions for no reason (it ends up controlling the disease somehow) and they call the people outside ""breathers"". Supposedly it's because the military always wears gasmasks, but once you find out the reality (at about minute 65 of this 85 minute movie), the term becomes silly. Who would end up calling them ""breathers""? It's about lying to the audience, and nothing more.They have to escape their hovel and end up in a confrontation with the military, raging out, the dad dies, and the mom and daughter escape. They end up finding others who have survived and go into another bunker to presumably live the rest of their lives.For what the movie actually is, it's okay. It's an inexpensive movie taking place on largely two sets and focuses on some low level tension based horror that works intermittently. The character work is okay, the scares are okay. It's...okay. My rating is based on this.Now, for my screed. The idea that the movie intentionally hides from the audience for three-quarters of the runtime is far more interesting than what it presents for that runtime. Three survivors of a plague who aren't survivors but are the infected, trying to live their lives in a new reality as the military chases them down. I get an ""I am Legend"" vibe from that concept. It's cool. It's also too bad that the movie is more interested with tricking the audience than exploring the ideas of their concept. If the movie had spent its 80 minutes exploring how two adults raise their innocent child in a new reality where they are not even normal but dangerous to the rest of humanity, there would have been a lot more for the film to actually do other than worry about a rat eating their cans of food. ""Why am I different? Why are the authorities that you brought me up to trust now trying to kill us? Will we ever be able to go back?"" These would be hard questions for the parents to answer, and the movie could play them out in dramatic ways that engage the audience. Instead, we get a middling horror movie about nothing.As I said, the movie I actually got was fine. The acting is fine. It looks good for its budget. It finds way to fill the time with decent character bits. The problem is that they're thin and rote while, at the same time, the Duffer Brothers (of Stranger Things and the sole reason I sought out this nothing horror movie from five years ago) created an interesting situation for them that they largely ignored. It's fine, but it could have been far more interesting using the very ingredients actually present in the film."
" Unique, Not What You'd Expect
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,8,"Definitely check this out! Every time you think you've figured this movie plot out, it takes another twist. Very good acting by most all involved too. This is one of those movies that has you jumping and cringing over and over as each event takes place. It was a little slow a couple times but it makes up for in the long run."
" Could things get any stranger in this topsy turvy play on the zombie genre?
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,8,"Could things get any stranger in this topsy turvy play on the zombie genre? Well, it's not for me to say, but you could take the consensus and fill a Duffer--I mean, an industrial size trash bag with it? Suffice to say, it's enormous and filled with good reviews in addition to intentions. All kidding aside, this is a movie that is well worth your time. A truly original flick *and* harbinger of excellence to come in the scifi realm taboot re those very Duffer Brothers. If only that one massively popular TV show had half as interesting a twist waiting and didn't rely on completely earnest and compelling interpersonal drama and day-to-day humor instead. Just kidding. The Walking Dead this ain't. Just kidding again. (My review is apparently also HIDDEN? I'm sorry; I'm on fire.) Listen, this is a solid 8/10 recommendation for me. The film is perfectly stylized, eloquently shot (especially the lurking Breathers and their shiny green eyes above ground) and the final twist, while perhaps cutesy in retrospect, sincerely caught me off guard, and a nice, polished ending leaves the door open for a sequel (free time might be an issue, but a bigger budget... that'll reside in plain sight, thank you very much)."
" This is movie waste of time!
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,1,Hidden is just mediocre horror thriller movie with bad storyline and stupid plot twists
" You, You Dirty Rat!
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,7,"""Hidden"" is essentially a three character film. The story opens with a small family, Ray (Alexander Skarsgard), his wife Claire (Andres Riseborough and their young daughter Zoe (Emily Alyn Lind) living in a dark damp and claustrophobic shelter, hiding from some unknown danger.They have been ""down there"" for 301 days. The shelter had been stocked with plenty of un perishable food and sleeping quarters. One day they discover that a rat has been chewing through cans of their precious food supply. In trying to catch the rodent, a fire breaks out almost suffocating the family. In flashbacks, we are given explanations in bits and pieces as to what caused the panic in the streets. The citizens of Kingsville, South Carolina fleeing from the city had been prevented from doing so by a military force who enforces a quarantine of the area.The family following the fire, find it necessary to emerge from their hiding place.. They make their way to the quarantine check point and discover...............................................................................A gritty little film but depressing in that most of the story takes place in a dark depressing and damp bunker. And, we are never told how and why the bunker was put there in the first place. The actors are all great and give the viewer the impression of people trying to survive a hostile outside world.It's different but worth a look."
" Do not read any spoilers
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,10,This movie was awesome. It was extremely tense and well acted. The little girl can hang with any adult actor. Ive seen her in some kids movies that my daughter watched but here she shines and has a bright future. The Duffer Bros went on to make Stranger Things so i am not surprised to find this little gem on their resume. Some people say it was slow. They want to watch marvel crap with cgi explosions every 3 minutes. Do not read any reviews with spoilers because its better to go in blind.
" Solid Film
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,8,"Definitely a slow burn but a solid watch. The film feels like a mix between Birdbox and A Quite Place. It's not a horror film, plays more like a Sci-fi thriller. The two lead actors do a great job, the girl playing the child character is often annoying. The film feels too short and could definitely use more of a backstory explaining what caused the events in the film. However... Overall it's entertaining and keeps your interest."
" Interesting Virus Infection
",2019-10-18 00:00:00,6,"But the plot moves too slow. And revealing are quite little by little and slowly maybe they try to reduce budget? I'm kind of hope there's are more appearances or could say more detail about the virus, but this movie too focus on one plotline only, which is why makes it a little bit boring, but it only decently entertain me. Nevertheless, if only watch one, then it is enough, it is easy to forget it."
" Limp wristed attemp at suspense.
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,1,"With the film opening to total confusion for it to end with no explanation or real depth into the cause or effects of the virus.
Its a real shame as the premise of this film has so much potential . Sections very long winded which could be time better spent.the acting was brilliant but let down by poor writing ."
" ""Hidden"" gem for sure
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,8,Not sure how I missed seeing this movie. I stumbled upon it one night on  day I'm glad I did. This movies mildly slow in the beginning but that seems to create the suspense and make the plot more interesting later. The acting is perfect even the child actor. Definitely not a horror movie more thriller/suspense movie. A few twists and turns makes for a unique movie.
" potential wasted by unoriginal lazily written ending!
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,1,"Let me tell you what happens, basically they are hiding from something, starts off boring then starts to get suspenseful when the people find them, yes i said it people, they are hiding from the UNINFECTED people because THEY are the ones who are in fact infected with some weird virus which turns them into monsters, oh but they can control it and turn it on and off like a switch, the cheesy effects are laughable, they run into an old friend and find a bunch of people who are also hiding from normal humans and infected, the end. totally stupid ending, waste of time and completely ruined by the lazy, unoriginal ending which seemed to just be thrown together and rushed through and ruined what COULD have been a good movie, but made it horrible and a complete disappointment. don't waste your time watching this."
" Bad and failure
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,1,"Don't waste your precious time on this bad movie, Not horror but horrible, no drama no story nothing at all."
" Hidden 2016
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Great Sci-fi movie with a family twist; I love movies when the Good guy wins against the odds. So the father dies but, the legacy and strength by their will to survive is what I got from this."
" Good story
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,8,Was not a scary movie but really like the storyline
" A Hidden Gem
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,7,This movie is truly a hidden gem. It is slow movie but really hold you and gives you timely excitement to keep going. It's a nice and short movie really well acted and directed.
" The Duffer Brothers
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,7,"Ray (Alexander Skarsgård), Claire (Andrea Riseborough), and their daughter Zoe (Emily Alyn Lind) have been hiding in an underground bunker for 301 days. There are unspoken dangers above hunting them. They may be the last survivors.Before Stranger Things, The Duffer Brothers made this movie. It's their only feature length film. It's a small horror. It came and went without much fanfare. This is a back-filling exercise for me. The guys seem to have a good sense of tension and dread. It is very small and atmospheric. In a few instances, the dialogue comes off clunky. It is a little notable to see them with another child actor. This one is asking her to do more and she mostly pulls it off. She's experienced despite her young age. About halfway thru, I got a notion of the twist. The monster design is lacking which does lead to my guess. There is a double twist which is kinda cool but I would have done it differently."
" Where has this movie been hiding?
",2018-10-25 00:00:00,10,"Loved this movie! How in the world did I miss this movie. Seriously, there are a lot of ridiculous scary movies out there, this is not one of them! If you love suspense or horror, you need to see this one."
" Left a little on the Table
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,6,"Good story with a nice little twist at the end. Violent but not gory, which is always nice. But I wish we could have got a little more of the back story. What happened to the rest of the town? How did they meet their survival or demise? The flashbacks were refreshing and we could have used more. We needed to crawl out of the hole a little more and learn. We learned way too much about how they lived down there when we were to be thrown out anyway. But altogether it was a nice change from the predictable."
" This is so worth your time!
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,10,"The first half hour or so is slow and methodical, setting up everything...giving you a feel of their underground existence and isolation. Then the action starts and your heart starts to pound. And when you get to the ending, it is an excellent pay-off.I will NOT give any spoilers. I just want to make sure you understand that, if you are a fan of post-apocalyptic films, you MUST see this and add it to your collection. There is no disappointment."
" Terrible new trend in horror
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,1,"Horror that isn't horror. Horror that's really a fable. Horror that's centered around child protagonists. Horror that humans are worse than any monster. Boring, slow, too dark to see anything. Just long enough for viewers to completely rewrite a better story in their heads before the film is over. This new brand of horror needs to be locked in a box and forgotten."
" High ratings?! Sounds like bs to me...*Spoilers!
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,3,"I think these ""It's So Wonderful!"" and ""best movie I ever saw gosh darn!"" gushes over this very mediocre film are from people who are affiliated with it in some way. Because I didn't see the same movie. What I saw was a mish-mash of crapola with an annoying brat, implausible occurrences...such as rats chewing through a whole stash of canned food, (which, was one of the most ridiculous things I've seen, I mean these rats were good, they even managed to drink all the water & juices veggies & fruits are canned in, like, as if) and more holes than the proverbial swiss cheese. Badly shot, dark & cramped, wishy-washy adults and when the ""truth"" is revealed it's kind of meh tbqh.3/10 is probably too generous but that's what it gets."
" One of the best mystery/thriller movies I've ever seen.
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,10,"Not really sure about the low score for this movie. I'm watching Stranger Things S02 atm. and I've seen that directors are them brothers. So I checked their filmography and voila, found another jewel.Atmosphere of this movie was top in the field. Perfect effects, superb environment, I liked the twist. In general, this movie had it all and is on par with some of the best movies out there overall."
" Good Premise, Didn't Deliver
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,6,"I'm not as enthusiastic about this film as other reviewers here are, though the low overall rating shows I'm not alone in my feelings. Part of the problem was that I guessed the ""reveal"", the twist, early on. It was pretty well telegraphed, if you paid attention to the start of the movie. As short as the movie was, I actually started to get bored with it at about the 1 hour mark, probably because of that.One thing I didn't quite understand, though. At the end of the movie, the daughter sees the sunrise and says, ""302 days"", since they were counting the number of days they had been in hiding, and the mother replies ""Not 'days'"". Maybe I'm reading too much into it, looking for some deeper meaning. I guess it's as simple as she meant they preferred the dark over daylight, since they were hiding from the ""Breathers"". And because of, well, that other thing?"
" Good Horror/Thriller with an interesting plot twist.
",2018-05-10 00:00:00,7,"Hidden: Yes, another Outbreak. A mother, father and daughter have hidden in a fallout shelter for 301 days, Food is running short and In an attempt to kill a rat an oil lamp is knocked over, the resulting fire is put out but it may attract the attention of the Breathers, whose stamping and heavy breathing can be heard. The family struggle to secure the shelter entrance against Breathers who attempt to break in.Through flashbacks the story of the Outbreak gradually unfolds. The virus has turned many into fast moving Zombiesque creatures, difficult to kill and possessed of superhuman strength.Good Horror/Thriller with an interesting plot twist. 7/10."
" Unexpected
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,8,"Having seen several movies with the same premise, of people hiding in an enclosed space from an unknown threat (most often a virus), I did not expect that much from this movie. Turns out I could have raised mu expectations quite high without being disappointed. A family hides in a bomb shelter from what are being referred to as ""breathers"". Initially we don't get to know who or what these breathers are, but as the slow paced story unfolds more of the background is revealed, and the pace increases into a climactic ending that twists and turns in ways that basically turns the story on its head. It is not a perfect movie. It has flaws - but they are few and forgivable - and if you don't like slow paced movies, you may not enjoy the first hour. But if you do, you will not be disappointed."
" Yup!
",2017-12-07 00:00:00,7,"A surprisingly well done fine little movie of the (post)apocalyptic genre with a surprising twist in the end. No big production or big names but good acting and good production value and for certain, not one of the kinds where the movie poster is the most pro work of the whole production. If you like such movies like The Road this one is made for you. Thumbs up!"
" Very Entertaining
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,7,"Like most people on here i have enjoyed this movie from start to finish, very exciting and well written. I like low-budget movies that shows effort in the making and this is one of them.Worth the time and it is very different than the rest. It did open the door for other movies to have the same scenery like the one to come out in 2018 called A Quiet Place and i am excited for that one too."
" They found us.
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,8,"A virus breaks out which effects the human population. Zoey (Emily Alyn Lind) and her parents are in a bomb shelter hiding from ""The Breathers"" as the film opens. There are some flashbacks, but it is light. The first 45 minutes introduces the characters and their life as we wonder about the ""Breathers."" At 45 minutes or so the action begins as the film takes a wicked Twilight Zone twist. Didn't see it coming. Bravo.If anything they could have made given the characters some character, but that appears to have been by design Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity."
" It's a new way of telling a Virus/zombie story!
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,7,"We follow a father a mother and a daughter hidden in a bomb shelter near a school. They hide from what they call The creatures/the breathers. What matters most is survival. They've made it for 301 days so far is not willing to give up now. The bomb shelter is now their home, and whole world and hey've made a set of rules in order to survive, which later will be less ambiguous. Towards the middle of the film it gets more interesting when we finally get to see a glimpse of ""the breathers"" big black shapes with glowing yellow eyes, you get the feeling that they're either some sort of werewolf or Zombie. But little did we know they're the military with night vision goggles. And the real threat is actually the family and the rest of the people hidden in the town. Now the set of rules are explained, why they must keep calm is because otherwise they'll trigger the virus and become a zombie, I'd compare it to the HULK. They've outsmarted the virus and learned a way to control it, so when they trigger it and become crazy zombies they can defend what ever threat is coming their way and then go back to being normal, and I would assume that's why they believe they deserve to live and not get slaughtered by the military. You're giving clues throughout the movie about the twist, but you never get time to let it sink in and puzzle it together, but once you get to the end it gets all clear, which I really like about it. It's a new take on the virus/zombie genre, that I think any zombie lover would like."
" Good Concept, Bad Movie
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,1,"Seriously, just because an idea is good, it doesn't make the movie itself good. The idea they had is an interesting twist to an apocalypse movie, but they put little or no effort into making a good movie using that idea. I hope someone does copy the idea and make a good movie. This one just isn't."
" Poorly lit, and predictable""twist""
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,5,"So I am really starting to dislike these movies that are so poorly lit, it's difficult to see what's happening on the screen. Unfortunately this movie is full of scenery so dark it makes me want to adjust the brightness of my TV, which I know doesn't need adjustment based on the day time scenes. As far as the twist goes, I've pretty much guessed that based on the ""we're different""speech mommy gave. It reminded me of a similar bit of dialogue from the movie ""the others"" which had a similar twist. To be honest the movie isn't bad, I got it as part of a multipack of horror movies, but I'll probably only watch this the one time and eventually forgot I even own it."
" Stinky pooh pooh
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,1,This is one of the worst horror movie I have ever seen. The twist in this movie are really stupid. The story line is awful and slow. It is not scary. I do not know why it got a 6.4 that is just overrating this movie. This is a 1. Do not see this movie. If you want see I really scary movie see Dracula (1931). Frankenstein (1931) is also very scary. So it The Exorcist that is a very scary movie. Do not see this movie. Do not wast your time. Do not wast your money. It is one of worst horror movies of all time. It has the most stupid ending. It not scary it is boring.
" Hidden Treasure
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,10,If honest I decided to watch this movie because it had Alexander Skarsgård in it who I enjoy watching. I had heard nothing about it other than what I read here months ago when it was in post production. It was sadly not advertised anywhere here because I would have happily seen it on the big screen. It is a great story with well developed characters and a good story. Some good twists and well worth a watch.
" Little Gem in the Horror Genre
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,7,"In Kingsville, Ray (Alexander Skarsgård), his wife Claire (Andrea Riseborough) and their little daughter Zoe ""Zozo"" (Emily Alyn Lind) have been living in an underground shelter for three hundred days hidden from the ""Breathers"". They have created and follow four rules to stay alive. Ray frequently recalls when an outbreak reached Kingsville and the army bombed the whole town during the quarantine, and he believes they are the only survivors. When they find that many supplies have been stolen from the pantry, Ray finds that a rat is the responsible. They chase the rodent and there is an accident with a kerosene lamp that burns a table. Now they are afraid that the ""Breathers"" might have seen the smoke. Will they be safe in the shelter?The tense ""Hidden"" is a little gem in the horror genre. The plot seems to be a conventional post-apocalypse story, but the plot point is absolutely original and unexpected. Alexander Skarsgård), Andrea Riseborough and Emily Alyn Lind are very convincing in the role of a trapped family. The hopeless conclusion is too dark and the consequences will certainly be devastating for either side. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available"
" Do yourself a favor...watch it.
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,10,I don't want to say anything at all except this is an excellent movie with a completely unexpected twist. I'm usually on point about how things will go in movies and I didn't even see this one coming. I'm not even bothered at all by the slow build in the beginning. The acting is superb as well. I picked this up today in the $5 Wal-Mart movie bin....a hidden gem without a doubt. Watch this. I promise you won't be sorry.
" Slow burn but worth it for the twist.
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,8,"You have to be committed with this film if you want the end reward and it is certainly worth the wait.With a steady build you are slowly enticed into wondering what on earth is out there, but of course you have already decided what cliché lurks in the darkness. Trust me, you will be wrong.The twist is very clever and unique. It's very un-Hollywood, which makes it all the more worth watching.Enjoy. I certainly did."
" This was truly an ""hidden gem""
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"This movie was amazingly surprising. Don't let the reviews fool you, this is a very interesting twist on the survival genre. I was very happy to look past what I had overheard about the movie.The atmosphere was just perfect, photography is also very well planned and excels in it's subtle plays on shadows and scheme to achieve an eerie claustrophobic essence. The pace of the movie was just ideal.The acting of both Andrea Riseborough and Alexander Skarsgård was good enough to get you in their mind set and see the events from their perspective. I was little disappointed with Elimly Lind however, she kinda lowers the acting score, but still manage to give a passable performance. This was a very creative story. It's often hard to impose a small set during the majority of a feature, but this time, it was greatly executed. The use of the flashback expertly timed helped to accomplish this. The Duffer brothers clearly crew up dreaming and breathing 80's movies. The atmosphere that transpires from this production clearly shows what got Shawn Levy interested in them.This was really a ""hidden"" gem."
