" It's not the kids' job to love you, it's your job to love them
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,6,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the comedy drama Ricki and the Flash (2015), where the queen herself Meryl Streep plays Linda who leaves her family many years ago to pursue her dream of being a rock star and now goes by the name Ricki. The movie opens to her performance at a local bar and we can see how Ricki hasn't achieved the success she hoped for, however Ricki and her band the Flash do an awesome job in rocking our Tom Petty's American Girl. In reality Ricki is a cashier at a grocery store and soon gets a call from her ex-husband played by Kevin Kline that their daughter is going through a a divorce and is in depression. The story starts here where a mother who left her family is now trying to make amends with her daughter and her other two sons.The story is a recycled yet has its moments and there is great acting from everyone but the dialogue was a letdown. Another let down was how the tension between Streep's character and her children had no substance and the wasnt executed well. There were many opportunities to dive abit more into some of these characters which felt wasted including Ricki's political stance - shes a musician yet shes a conservative? Why bring it up if not explaining it more in detail to further each character? However, the line that hit home late in the movie 'It's not the kids' job to love you, it's your job to love them' was deep and so true. The big moments of this film is not the fact Streep is playing along-side Kline again or that she is playing along-side her real life daughter - it's the music. If you are into 80s rock pop culture then have a crack at this movie. Streep has amazing vocals and if she is playing that guitar all herself then wow, this woman is truly gifted. Great music which plays a major role in this flick with covers from Lady Gaga's Bad Romance to Drift Away. Overall 6.2/10"
" Mamma Mia!
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,1,"Surely that wasn't really Meryl Streep? It must have been someone pretending to be her? She would never make a film that bad? Would she? If she did, it's the first of her films that I've ever wanted to turn off after just a few minutes (Mamma Mia, Here We Go Again! Doesn't count, because she's not really in it and it shouldn't count for anything anyway, because it's almost as bad as this film).
I don't really get what the film was trying to say, what the point the writer was trying to get across was- Everyone needs some rock and roll in their lives? Follow your dreams, no matter who you scar along the way? Do whatever you want and nothing will turn out right anyway? I really don't know, but one thing it taught me, was to never watch it again.It's sad to say that even Meryl didn't give her A game in this one.
Some of the music wasn't bad, but the eye candy was limited and young Meryl did not get the good bits of her Mother's face. That's mean, she probably looks lovely when she smiles, but there was nothing to smile about in this film."
" Entertaining????
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,2,"Well NO! I realise that this is, in my case, one of those on ""free to view"" but it was being shown at 4pm UK time which suggested something distinctly viewable for all family members....WRONG! language is quite colourful and within minutes of the film opening we have Ms Streeps character being verbally abused....NOT A FAMILY Film and if easily offended - don't bother"
" I love it
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,Great movie. Might even be my favorite Meryl Streep role.
" Meryl Rocks
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,7,"This, along with, ""She Devil"" and ""Death Becomes Her"" are my favorite Meryl Steep movies. She showed her talent toward comedy. I also liked ""The River Wild"" a lot.I really liked watching Meryl in ""Ricki and the Flash"" because she did not have her usual, what I call Merylisms. She has a tendency to use the same facial expressions, hand movements and body language in every movie that she has done. I like Meryl, but Cate Blanchett is a far better actress that can disappear into a role, whereas, when you are watching Meryl, you are watching Meryl. It's the same as watching John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart or Bette Davis. With that criticism out of the way, Meryl did not do that in this movie. I've watched in many times. There are a couple of parts that drag, mainly the scene with her and Kevin Kline stoned in the kitchen and then going to the basement to go through his Rubbermaid memorabilia. That scene could have been cut, in fact Kevin Kline could have been cut. Anyone could have played that part. The real chemistry with Meryl with Rick Springfield and the band. That's when the movie came alive for me. Meryl can sing, but, I must say, rock is not her best genre. I just like her interaction with Rick.She was good with her real life daughter, Mamie Gummer. Her character did get on my nerves though. She was a bit over the top. Maybe it's because I have known and worked with many depressive needy victims in the past and I can't say that I have that much sympathy. I did like at the wedding when Mamie's character was going to turn and run, Meryl said ""No, no, no, don't run away. Walk on"". That was her reflection of what she had done when she left her family to pursue a singing career that did not turn out the way that she had planned. But, she realized it, as did her daughter in those two sentences.The oldest son's bride, I could have just smacked her. But, in all honestly, she was reacting to the situation. She was definitely an uptight ivy league type who was used to the ""perfect"" family that she was marrying into and then all of a sudden, here comes this rocker chick in her late 60's, what's a girl to do? React to every little event, I guess. She was just window dressing that was also over the top. I did like the bride's maids and brides dresses. They were unique and lovely.The two sons, meh. Again, like Kevin Kline's character, anyone could have played them.The real chemistry was when the band played on."
" This is Happy ending?
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,5,"It's not a bad film.
She is rocker but couldn't be mother.
I think she choice was't bad but this story go well too much."
" Cringe-Worthy in Every Aspect
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,2,"Contains, maybe, one good scene, amid an endless procession of cringe-worthy moments. The notion that this woman would abandon her children to chase her dream of playing in a mediocre bar band is, both, curious and laughable. While it does appear that Rick Springfield's guitar chops have developed, nicely, his acting chops have, clearly, not advanced since his days of playing Dr. Noah Drake on General Hospital, although, admittedly, the dialogue he was given was completely moronic, to begin with. The most embarrassing moments, of all, are some of the music scenes, in particular, the young people dancing at the bar to the U2 song (oh my God, is it possible to pile cheese any higher ????), and the end, with the wedding guests all line-dancing to Ricki's original tune. Anyone who's ever been in a band knows that, unless they play a famous song that everyone knows, a generic audience will disregard them, completely. I mean, I could say this movie is so bad that it's good, but the reality is ... it's so bad, to the point that it's embarrassing."
" It's ok, few laughs with drama. story has holes and
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,6,"It's a watchable film that has a few laughs. The story of a aging rocker who had a modicum of talent and then left her hugely successful husband and family to pursue a dream seems far fetched and highly unlikely. Streep and Klein are good but it's pretty far (putting it mildly) from their best. Drags a bit, could have been better."
" Enjoyed the movie
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,8,Guess I am one of the few who enjoyed this film along with my daughter.
" Why all the singing???
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,3,"I have the utmost respect for Meryl Streep as an actress. She is amazing and has deserved all the acclaim for her roles in a wide variety of exceptional movies. That being said, a few years ago she made ""Mama Mia""...which proved that despite her prodigious talents, Ms. Streep cannot do everything...especially when it came to singing. Perhaps this is why she later made ""Ricki and the Flash""...to prove she really COULD sing. And, while she was passable, it just convinced me that once again Meryl should NOT be singing in her films. Inexplicably...Streep just finished another musical...""Mama Mia! Here We Go Again"". Please, please stop already!!The story begins with a long song delivered by Meryl in a honkeytonk....and there was much more of this to come. If they'd just stopped with that one song, it might have been okay. They didn't. You learn that Meryl left her family to pursue her musical career. Her husband (Kevin Kline) has since remarried and they've both lived totally separate lives since. However, their daughter (played by Streep's real life daughter) is having emotional problems and he has invited her to come back to see their daughter, and, perhaps, to help. What comes after that is pretty cliched, though the film DOES have some excellent moments and might even elicit a few tears. My problem is the shameless way the film had Ricki (Streep) come and perform at her son's wedding and, apparently, that just made everything great and the film ends. Thank heaven for the magical power of Meryl's singing....not.The bottom line is that this movie would have been excellent if there never had been any singing at all...and the singing was a distraction. Additionally, the band actually had, as lead guitarist, Rick Springfield...a guy who really CAN sing and make music....why not let him sing if you insist on having singing?! Overall, I was pretty disappointed in this one...mostly because Meryl is a mega-talent....just not when it comes to singing."
" Ricki and the Flash feels more classical than rock 'n' roll.
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,5,"The late Jonathan Demme had a illustrious career of acclaimed titles including 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Philadelphia'. He was undoubtedly a pioneering director in the early 90s. So it gives me no pleasure in saying that this, his last directorial effort, was his blandest production. A mother chooses to become a rock star and leaves her family behind, however years later her daughter is divorced and so she is called back to confide in her and reconcile with the rest of the family. Basically, it's what I like to call a ""Sunday afternoon"" film. A bland, generic, predictable drama with some cheesy comedy and a positive vibe where in the end everyone lives happily ever after. It really was as basic as that. A few mature themes are thrown into the cacophony of guitar strums, such as an absentee parent attempting reconciliation with their estranged daughter. Using the medium of music to express emotions. It's all executed fine, and it's perfectly watchable. Yet, it is absolutely nothing new. We've all seen it before in more memorable productions. Streep gives a musically commanding performance, and her character of Ricki is obviously the most developed and relatable. A few awkward dialogue exchanges, particularly the family reunion dinner, provides dark humour. In fact, Cody's screenplay is surprisingly bleak and edgy (whilst being funny, don't worry) however it contrasts with Demme's placid directing style. The two just do not marinate. The first half built up character and focus, then the second half crumbles and decides to shift subplots and focus more on Ricki and her band than with her daughter. Just did not work in my opinion. The music was good though, made me want to get up and dance...so that's a positive. Ricki certainly is flashy, hosting solid performances and engrossing concert music. But the all too predictable plot, inconsistent tone and lack of focus results in a forgettable entry within Demme's filmography. Does anyone think Streep could actually be in a rock band? Totally could see it happen..."
" Great Story.
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,8,"A great plot to the movie and a funny one too. A movie to go watch with the whole family.
-TE (8.15.15)"
" Lovely
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,8,Sebastian Stan looks beautiful as hell in this one and I love it
" Meryl's Movie
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,9,"I loved Meryl in this movie. As we all know, she is an amazing, amazing actor. Worth watching for her performance alone. But there is a lot more to the movie as well. Great to see Rick Springfield and Kevin Kline. Shortening the Ricki and the Flash performances though would have helped."
" It's that music, it's great
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,4,"To tell the truth, when I went to see her I knew what she was going to see and it did not surprise me, it's a family comedy but with two great actors. But with that music that makes you dance in the armchair, who does not finish seeing even knowing that it is bad. It is more even in the end, with the end you have, but you are smiling.The characters are bad, does anyone expect something different? But the truth is Meryl and Kevin are always great. She puts you in the movie and even knowing that as a mother is bad, but you can not help but catch her darling.In this film I do not believe that it is necessary to analyze it technically, it is not made for that, nor is it worth the analysis of anythingJust have fun with the music and let yourself go"
" Another Aging Rocker Story
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,6,"Linda Brummell a.k.a. Riki Rendazzo (Meryl Streep), leaves her husband and children behind to live a Rock-n-Roll life. She's been somewhat successful, but now plays in local bars at night and works at an organic grocery store during the day.While his 2nd wife is away, Riki's ex-husband, Pete (Kevin Kline) calls her and asks her to leave California and head back to Indianapolis to be with their daughter Julie (Mamie Gummer/Steep's real life daughter). Julie is very depressed, looks a wreck, could use a shower, and is generally miserable after her husband leaves her for another woman. Riki heads home unsure of what to expect and wondering what kind of help it is that she can really offer. Riki's boyfriend, Greg (Rick Springfield) is just as tired of Riki's self absorbed ways as her family is. This is one of those modern day screwed up families that seems to find their way. Good popcorn movie."
" Not all movies can be great but this could have been better
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,5,"With Streep, Kline and Demme on board one would expect very little going wrong. Add a script by Diablo Cody and make sure it does. Streep is Ricki (Linda, actually) an aging rocker who left her hubby Pete and three kids in unexplained circumstances. Ricki pursued her musical dream in LA without much success and is currently holding a day job as checkout cashier and a night one as singer of the titular band.The script wants us to believe she has no money, but I thought she should be a bit less strapped for cash, with two jobs and probably some royalties.... anyway, let's believe Ricki is poor, but still enjoying a decent life with loving band member Greg.One day Pete calls to inform her their daughter Julie is ""depressed"" because her husband dumped her, so Ricki flies to Indianapolis, where Pete lives with his second wife in rich bourgeois environment, way above Ricki's humble LA lodgings.Ricki's kids are resentful, but it should be noted that kids always blame parents, regardless of their failings. However, Ricki manages to help Julie and patches up her relation with the other two.On the good side, Streep is OK as Ricki, with her flaws and unpleasant sides, but also her frustration. As a mother she could not have ""two"" dreams and was forced to chose either the family or the music. Streep also sings decently and is quite believable in her standard rocker ""uniform""of black leather and unflattering hairdo. Kline is also good in an understated performance. The scenes in LA are more interesting than the ones in Indianapolis.On the less good side, the title is as bland and uninspired as most of the story. Streep's daughter plays Julie and made me wonder why children of famous actors do not try different jobs to spare themselves some embarrassment. For one Michael Douglas, there are the kids of Glenn Close, Kevin Costner, Dustin Hoffman, Tom Hanks etc... who all tried and failed at acting. Streep's daughter is OK, but will never be able to compare to her mother, so hers seems an exercise in futility.Although plenty of music is played in the film, the score fell flat for me, with not a single goose bumps musical moment. One of Ricki's kids is gay for no other reason than adding controversy to an already sticky situation (or to get some PC on board). Leaving the - already mediocre - music angle aside, this is a major blame feast with an illogical ending."
" A Fair Watch With Impressive Performances!
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,6,"The Final Film by the Late/Great Jonathan Demme, 'Ricki and the Flash' is a fairly entertaining film, that works in parts. Though very predictable, this comedy-drama still has its heart at the right place.'Ricki and the Flash' Synopsis: A musician who gave up everything for her dream of rock- and-roll stardom returns home, looking to make things right with her family.'Ricki and the Flash' is a tale on family & bond, and how ambition sometimes can affect relationships deeper than imagined. Its interesting to see Ricki mingle with her estranged family & later realize the importance of being united. Diablo Cody's Screenplay is decent, but its very predictable. There are no surprises here & it firmly sticks to the genre clichés. I wish there was some newness in its Writing. Demme's Direction is faultless, as always. His loss is truly among the most tragic moments of this year, as he was truly a Master at his craft. Cinematography & Editing are fair.Performance-Wise: Meryl Streep as Linda / Ricki, slips into her character effortlessly & comes up with a winning performance. The Thespian doesn't miss a single beat. Kevin Kline, another Acting Giant in his own right, is simply superb as Ricki's former husband. Mamie Gummer (Meryl's real-life & reel-life daughter here as well), is natural to the core as the suffering soul. And Rick Springfield shines as Ricki's supportive boyfriend. Others lend perfect support. On the whole, 'Ricki and the Flash' offers nothing new, but its warm film nonetheless."
" Rather Pointless, Padded with Music
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,6,"A musician (Meryl Streep) who gave up everything for her dream of rock-and-roll stardom returns home, looking to make things right with her family.This film ended up on my to-see list simply because I wanted to pay tribute to Jonathan Demme. This is not one of his better films, and despite what the DVD cover says, this is not one of Streep's best films, either. Heck, it is not even Diablo Cody's best work. It is middling on all counts, an average plot fleshed out with musical numbers.In more ways than one, this is sort of like Demme's ""Rachel Getting Married"". So, if you liked that, maybe you will like this. I may have enjoyed this one marginally more simply because it doesn't have Anne Hathaway. But both have damaged characters and a wedding as a central scene."
" Solid, Mid-Tempo Dramedy
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Ricki and the Flash sometimes dabbles in the corny, setting aside reality for easy fixes in its complex relationships. Otherwise, this family dramedy about loving others for who they are really works. Ricki is a great character who doesn't quite fit any one character cliché, riding the lines of good and bad like we all tend to do. The awkwardness is palpable, the humor is natural, the dialogue is engagingly overlapping and the performances are strong."
" Enjoyable performances are the bright lights here
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"Meryl Streep stars as an aging rocker in ""Ricki and the Flash"" from 2015. The film also stars Kevin Kline, Audra McDonald, Rick Springfield, and Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer.Ricki Randazzo abandoned her family to pursue her rock 'n' roll dreams. She works as a cashier in a store by day, and by night she and her band The Flash play in a small bar.When her ex-husband Pete (KLein) calls her to say their daughter Julie (Gummer) is having serious problems due to a break-up with her new husband, Ricki returns home.Miraculously, Ricki gets through to Julie and convinces her to bathe, get her hair styled, have a manicure and pedicure, and dress in something decent. Pete's wife Maureen (Broadway superstar Audra McDonald) is out of town but returns early. She and Ricki have a polite showdown where Maureen lets her know that she's been the real mother to the three kids (two boys and Maureen) and that Ricki left them. Ricki angrily returns to the band. Then she receives an invitation to her son's wedding from Maureen as a peace offering.Directed by Jonathan Demme, the script by Diablo Cody is based in part on her mother-in-law Terry Cieri, who has fronted a New Jersey bar band for years. It's not a perfect script by any means. It's predictable, for one thing; for another it's derivative, reminding one of the Greer Garson film ""Julia Misbehaves"" which has basically the same plot.It's Streep's delightful performance that puts this film on a level where it would not have been otherwise. Kline, Gummer, McDonald, and Springfield round out an excellent cast.I really enjoyed this. It's worth seeing - the music is great, too."
" Mediocre
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,5,"Waste of your time and definitely waste of the legend such as Meryl Streep. The movie is not really bad, but it has no qualities either. It is like average B production TV drama, cute, simple and predictable on every step of the way. If you decide to watch it you won't get bored, but tomorrow you won't even remember what you watched.5/10"
