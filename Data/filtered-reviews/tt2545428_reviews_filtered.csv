" A standard mountain climbing documentary about an insanely difficult route.
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,7,"Having done my fair share of hiking in the Colorado mountains, I know how deadly these rocky monuments can be. Meru (2015) highlights this in spades as it documents the conquering of one of the last untouched routes in professional mountain climbing. It's no wonder such a daunting spire of rock remained un-summited from this approach, and this film highlights all the challenges that combine to make Meru as difficult as it is. Of course, because it's a mountain climbing documentary, it follows most of the tropes and cliches common in the genre.One of my biggest qualms with the mountain climbing genre of documentaries is how they all tend to be about the same progression of events. There's always some storm that prevents the team from summiting. Somebody always gets injured. Success is always just out of reach. It also doesn't help that there's no way for the uneducated viewer to tell this slab of rock and ice apart from any other footage of rock and ice. Meru does manage to have a few moments to show the context of the climbers' progress, even if they are few and far between.I will admit that the achievement of these climbers is quite commendable. The task of ascending Meru's ""Shark Fin"" seems like a fool's errand, considering there must have to be easier routes to the top. The fact that this peak has been summited probably less than a dozen times since it was first climbed in 2001 does make this film that much more impressive. Not only did these guys climb the Shark Fin in less-than-ideal conditions, but they did so while also filming the incredible untouched beauty of the mountain.A standard mountain climbing documentary about an insanely difficult route, I give Meru 3.5 stars out of 5."
" Watch it not just for love of adventure!
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,9,"This is my first review and I actually created account to review this. Its about climbing mountain Meru, which requires that you be expert of rock climbing and ice climbing and good at high altitudes... You got to be best of all the worlds in terms of mountaineering. I think the same goes for the movie. A good mountaineering movie is not just about what happens in mountains. Its not just about portray of thrills and dangers and display of courage out there. Its not just about good cinematography. Its as much about what drives one to do it. What drives one to attempt it again after failing... The whole physiological battle one has to overcome before actually facing the mountain.
This movie has portrayed it all beautifully!"
" I will never need coffee again.
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,10,"The memory of Meru will suffice.If you need something to inspire you and light a fire under you, Meru is a conflagration."
" Major Feat
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,8,I have a love for watching rock climbing films and documentaries. The intensity of the feats they tackle are unreal to me.Meru was just as great as it was hyped up to be. The drama of the obstacle that these men faced was as wild as the obstacle itself.It was fascinating and crazy to seem them work through their own emotions to traversing the climb of Meru.Breathtaking rock climbing documentary as usual.
" One of the best movies on climbing. Teamwork and ......
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,10,Have already watched it 3 times. ie every year. it is always refreshing.
" Peak Photography; Flat Story
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)Yes, these are some amazing mountain climbers. Highly skilled, smart, obsessive, no fear and a bit crazy...you have to be. Seeing their helmet cam footage while they climb is breathtaking. The film itself is not quite as impressive as the snow-covered peaks they ascend. Their back stories are fairly stereotypical for die hard mountain climbers and many risk losing their family if tragedy should occur yet they press on. There weren't any mind blowing unique facts about Meru and I didn't really learn anything beyond the climber's personal lives which would have magnified their efforts even more. So this is good at purely presenting good footage of some daring climbs."
" Spellbinding
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,7,How can human beings watch other human beings risk their lives in death defying feats? The Spanish bullfighter and Roman gladiator come to mind.
" Reach your SUMMIT!
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,10,"I'm not a climber, but we all have the impossible mountains in our lives. This film to me was the story that all of us have in our own lives.
Don't expect people to understand your path if they haven't been given your vision. Never give up on your dreams, prepare yourself to the fullest, and as long as you never give up you will succeed. NEVER NEVER QUIT!"
" Inspiring.
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,10,It displays the actual skill ability and courage of Conrad Jimmy and Renan. They are professionals and made it look easy and gives you the sense that you were there with them. Congratulations to their accomplishment and that's why I rated it a ten.

" Must watch for adventure lovers
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,9,"Meru, a 2015 film that documents the intense first ascent of Meru Peak's ""Shark's Fin"" route, beautifully combines stunning frames of the Himalayas with the personal struggles of mountaineering. Conrad Anker, a well decorated climber who has already been the first to conquer many other impossible feats on mountains around the world, assembles a three-person team to make an attempt at the impossible mission. Meru chronicles the issues that world-class mountain men face as they approach, and often cross, the limits of possibility for the human body. After narrowly missing the summit on their first attempt, in 2008, the team plans a return in 2011. Within months of their departure, however, they were cursed with a string of awful luck, leaving team member Renan Ozturk hospitalized, in life threatening condition. Weeks later, the other third of the team, Jimmy Chin, miraculously survives a massive avalanche, but it leaves him battling the metal trauma that an event like this causes. Still, though, they are able to fight through all of this and make another attempt at the summit soon after. All of the expedition footage in Meru is shot by the team themselves, adding a very personal feeling to the film, seeming somewhat like an extremely overproduced vlog for YouTube, a nice contrast to the much more heavily documented climbing movies that have become more prevalent in recent years.
Much of the movie's narration aims to explain why people risk their lives time and time again just to reach the peaks of the world. Many climbers describe it as something they absolutely need to do, a kind of addiction that they cannot stay away from. This provides interesting context into the minds of Conrad, Jimmy and Renan, showing why they were so determined to conquer Meru. This helps me more clearly understand why these elite athletes choose to risk their lives as a hobby. Without pushing their own bodies to further the limit of what a human can do, climbers like these three will always feel unfulfilled.
After Conrad witnessed his best friend and climbing partner, Alex Lowe, die in an avalanche that Conrad himself narrowly avoided, he swore off climbing for good. Lowe's widow, Jennifer, who later married Conrad, knew this was impossible for him. Picking a fight with the powers of Mother Nature obviously comes with immeasurable risk, but that is part of what mountaineers love. Winning a battle against some of the strongest forces we know, like avalanches, blizzards, or just the paralyzing mental state that miles of altitude forces unto someone is glorious. Conquering all of these restrictions has to be one of the proudest achievable feelings. It makes climbers champions, both in their own mind, and in the community around them. Before the ascent of Meru, Conrad was the only climber from the group with any notoriety, but since then, Jimmy Chin and Renan Ozturk have become more relevant, household names within the climbing community.
As a short side note, the one part of the movie that bothered me was the scene discussing the avalanche that Jimmy survived. Instead of using footage from the actual one that he experienced, they showed a much larger avalanche that I recognized to be from Alaska, not the Himalayas. I was confused at this choice, as it was clear that there was plenty of video to show his actual experience, but instead the producers decided to embellish the event and mislead the viewers. The rest of the film seemed much more genuine than this, but my limited knowledge of climbing makes me wonder whether or not there were other scenes that I was tricked into believing were from the same expedition.
Meru is a fantastic film to watch, whether or not you have any interest or knowledge in mountaineering. The cinematography is beautiful as it pans over the magical peaks of the Himalayas, and extremely genuine during footage added by the climbers. The constant narration from the team, their family and friends, as well as notable guests, like the decorated author Jon Krakauer, keeps the scenes that lack action engaging, and provide insight into aspects of the complex climb that most viewers would be unable to notice. Aside from the one clear negative previously discussed, I thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of this film."
" Awesome
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,10,Reading other reviews for this movie I felt the need to rate it. This movie is real. The accounts are real. The dangers and suffering are real. Cinematography is fantastic and the story is absolutely motivating to anyone watching it to be able to conquer any endeavor.
" A Breathtaking Documentary.
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,9,"I think there is no reason to reach the happy end as a result of imagining and working. Meru is watched in a breath. In Indian Mythology, it is technically impossible to climb this mountain, known as the meeting place of the Gods. To succeed you must follow the three mountaineers' quest to follow their dreams."
" Just because it's there...
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,7,"2/17/18. Amazing cinematography as hikers climb ever onward and upward. Can never understand why people do this, though for some, just being there is enough."
" Great cinematography
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,5,"I suspect that for mountain climbers and wannabes, this is a 10 star film, so I'll give it stars for them. And it certainly is beautiful.However, no matter how many climbing films I watch, I never get a good answer to the question in my mind which is, why do this incredibly dangerous thing? Jon Krakauer says, ""he had to,"" but that is patently false. Nobody has to!And so I am left at the end of this film with the same judgments I always have. I think, these men are bad sons, bad brothers, then bad boyfriends, then bad husbands, then bad fathers. I can't honor them. I suspect they are a little bit stupider than the average person. I suspect a psychiatrist could diagnose them with some mental illness. I'm struggling here to come to a kinder place, but I cannot. And if you don't want people to make judgments of you for doing a stupid, risky, suicidal thing, then you either shouldn't do this thing at all or you shouldn't make movies bragging about it."
