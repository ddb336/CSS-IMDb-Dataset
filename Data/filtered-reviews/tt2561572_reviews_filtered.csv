" Nothing surprising here
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,6,"Ok comedy, with good performances from both lead actors. Sadly the movie doesn't offer much surprises. Ferrel is again the master of improv in a few scenes."
" your average dumb comedy
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,5,"This is in no way different from any other dumb Will Ferrell comedy.
It has a lot of forced jokes, unesscary crudity, and a few very dumb but funny jokes so, if you know what to expect you wont be disappointed but if you don't you will probably be extremely irritated the entire movie."
" Hart is awful
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,3,Why does anyone cast this hyper unfunny Kevin Hart. He ruins every scene in which he appears.
" Average
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,7,"This movie had scattered laughs, but were too few and far between considering the stars. (Will Ferrell & Kevin Hart) I think it was a bit tasteless with the race jokes and other scenes. Basically, Ferrell gets accused of embezzling and asks Hart to keep him from being beaten up in prison. The final scene was a bit surprising and good, and it had a good cast, and the leads did work well together, but I feel like the racial humor could have been toned down and the movie could have been better.** out of ****"
" Offensive and unfunny even though the concept had promise
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,3,"The concept of Get Hard is funny, so it feels like this movie should work at least to some degree. Will Ferrell plays a clueless guy who is going to jail for white collar crimes, and he just assumes the guy who washes his car (played by Kevin Hart) has gone to prison before. So he hires this blue collar guy to prepare him for prison, not realizing that Hart is one of the most straightlaced normal people you could ask for and has never even been arrested. I feel like part of the reason the film didn't quite click for me was the fact that Will Ferrell seems to have his entire performance turned up to 11. He is not subtle in any way and instead of making the movie more humorous it is actually less funny when he goes to these extremes. On the flip side the one time Kevin Hart takes his performance up a notch (with some clear improv) it is actually good for a few laughs, but most of the way through he's forced to be the straight man. Another problem with Get Hard is that it doesn't take the time to address the extreme racism of certain parts of the plot, to the point that the movie treats it as more of a betrayal when Hart lies about his experience with prison than when Ferrell assumes he has gone there because of the color of his skin.The ""training"" that commences is all over the place and feels utterly moronic, which should be fine based on the premise of the film, because neither of these guys know anything about going to prison. Yet we're meant to believe that this series of odd training techniques does start to teach the main character how to survive. In fact, he becomes so in touch with the idea of prison life that he starts to teach himself some extra tricks that he feels will come in handy. The number of ""jokes"" that come merely from the fact that he has learned to hold things up his butt, is kind of embarrassing. There are a couple of fun scenes in the film that saved me from utter boredom and disgust. The biggest highlight was probably when this successful stock trader teaches a gang how to invest their money in the stock market in order to make millions, and they go on to have serious arguments with one another about the handling of different stocks. Otherwise, the plot of this film is so basic that I could predict exactly where it was going from the first scene, and it was just a matter of waiting to see what kind of stupid stuff would happen on the way to that conclusion. I've certainly hated comedies more than this one, but Get Hard did nothing to make me like it either."
" HILARIOUS
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,8,"A FINE comedy with a bit of action and also a little message of selflessness, this movie is must watch"
" Comedies didn't used to make you feel uncomfortable!
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,1,"Making people laugh has all sorts of artforms, and different comedians have their own way of creating humor. Ricky Gervais did so at the Emmy's while offending the liberal left with some off color humor... So I get it.But this nonsense was childish. The script must have been written by 8th grade boys who know nothing better to do than write filthy language and lowbrow humor. (and then he will push his naked hairy rear up against the glass) This was so bad. This film has almost non-stop curse words and dirty language. ""Dumb & Dumber"" had me laughing just two guys dressed in blue and orange tuxedos dueling with walking canes before entering a party ""TIMEOUT!..""Forced gay rape isn't funny. Screaming isn't funny. The ""white boys better not go to prison"" theme not funny. This movie is not funny."
" Not as bad as it could have been I guess
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,5,"For some reason, I continue to put myself through these dreadful Will Ferrell movies even though the standard gets worse with every release. Get Hard is certainly not the worst film Ferrell has been involved in and actually has some good moments. Kevin Hart works well as the co-star even though he is basically just being himself.The gay rape jokes are instantly tiresome and I'm surprised the cancel crew haven't had this wiped from existence already. I can handle offensive comedy but it has to be at least funny and preferably original and this is neither. As with nearly all these modern comedies, the writing is just so unoriginal and half-hearted. Cheap and tasteless, but fine if you want to zone out to some easy viewing"
" Far from Ferrell's best.
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,2,"I love Ferrell for his good bad movies. He knows what he can and can't do and that's exactly what makes him funny.Now this movie starts out pretty funny. The fact that it's pretty racist is a little bit off-putting but it's Ferrell and you know he's going to make dumb jokes but get it together, right? Well....no. Where with other movies there's running jokes that are great and sometimes heartfelt scenes that do hit the mark, this movie doesn't get further than having Hart be angry and Ferrell be clueless. Combined with a unhealthy dose of cliches, no chemistry except for the two stars of the show, a poor script and old jokes we're left with a very bland and boring movie."
" He got hard.
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,6,"Good comedy, very well directed. Writing is superb- Will Ferrel is amazing and Kevin Hart is really well cast in the role. Worth a watch."
" Most degenerate movie ever
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,1,"This movie is the most degenerate movie I've ever seen. They should be ashamed of themselves for spending time away from family recording this piece of trash.The writers and actors have nothing, their inspiration is zero and this is just a weak try to make something. Not funny at all and the story is worthless, everything is so bad.Don't watch it."
" Hardly funny
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,5,"Will Ferrell tries to salvage something but even Kevin Hart let's us down.The premise is unbelievably stupid, and the storyline is basic and lame.I wasn't expecting much, but this was below par for a Ferrell film"
" Funny movie with a predictable plot
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,5,"Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart team up in this screwball comedy directed by Ethan Coen about a wealthy billionaire(Ferrell) who is framed for fraud from his company and has 90 days till he goes to prison. So he gets help from a former convict(Hart) who teaches him how to survive prison life.Overall there is alot of racist jokes,crude humor etc but if you like these jokes you'll be grand. If not avoid.D+"
" I don't no
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,2,Will Farrel's films get worse as we get older. Is this probably the case for almost everyone?
" Definitely deserves a better rating
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,10,"If you're looking for a fun enjoyable movie, like Will Ferrel and Kevin Hart and their kind of humour then this should be a fine pick!"
" Really bad
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,2,"This is one of Will Ferrell's worst. There are a couple of funny bits, but mostly just really terrible."
" STORY HAS MAJOR HOLE.........
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,6,"Great comedians--fun to watch-but will Ferrell gets sentenced to 10 years hard time-30 days to ""get affairs in order"" house arrest--cuts ankle bracelet off and tries to get fianc√© to run with him in a moment of panic. She declines he gets arrested again. Now, in the real world, his band would be revoked-house arrest cancelled-he would be ordered to begin his sentence, and be facing an escape charge and likely receive 5 more years---instead, we see him arrested by Marshalls then cut to Kevin hart opening will Farrell's trunk in his underground car wash and is surprised to find him curled up in a ball in his own trunk?!--no explanation as to how he got there-why is he still free? And...apparently no longer on house arrest--it's like producers and writers are so confident with the talent, they got lazy and didn't bother to make sure the story makes sense--"
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,7,Very funny idea. Great dialogue. So many quotable lines. Two comedians that are naturally funny. So many funny faces and surprising parts that made me laugh extensively (2 viewings)
" Pleasant surprise!
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,8,"2 marks deducted for anti-white things. Can't really blame them though in this age of political correctness. But, the movie was really good. I did not expect it to be this funny."
" Worth a watch.
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,4,"Something like ""Big Stan"" but not as good. Definitely worth watching it."
" Worst Ferrell Movie Ever - Get Hard
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,1,"I like Will Ferrell, and I like the vast majority of his films. However, this effort(?) is easily the worst film he has ever made. It is just not funny. Even with the handy stereotype humor available in the film, it is still not funny. This couldnt even be a skit on SNL; or maybe a five minute skit, at best. So trying to build an hour and a half movie on a five minute skit is really not the best of ideas. Don't waste your time. What got harder and harder was watching this movie after ten minutes. I could write a better story and script in the bathroom on my lunch break."
" An underrated adult comedy!
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,8,Don't go with what critics have to say. The preparation (to be in jail) what main character goes through and his trainer lay down a good comedic path. The adult nature of humor is tremendous and can be projected for a bigger audience. The music is good as well.
" It's Fun
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,8,Has a lot of good laughs but doesn't bring anything new to the comedy genre
" A GAME YOU CAN WIN
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,8,"James King (Will Ferrell) is a rich broker on his way to jail. Darnell (Kevin Hart) washes his car. King has got 30 days to get his affairs in order and hires Darnell (Kevin Hart) to teach him to ""get hard"" so he won't be bullied (or worse) in prison. Most of the film consists of Hart teaching Ferrell a bunch of dumb stuff doing racial and gay humor. Eventually they get around to gee, maybe he is innocent, let's figure this out.Most of the humor was juvenile. Some scenes they carried out too long. The disgusting scenes tended to be short. I admit that I had to laugh out loud several times during a film that the audience certainly enjoyed more than I did. At times I felt I was watching ""48 Hours"" meets ""Trading Places."" I am not a fan of either star in this film. They can't act and individually I don't find them funny. They seemed to do well acting as a straight man for each other so neither one hogged the scene. Soft 4 stars.Guide: F-bomb, sex. Brief nudity including Ferrell's butt or body double."
" The movie sucked
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,4,"It had some laughs in the beginning, but was mostly ugly and desperate. It was a very rushed looking movie. Basically, he gets sent to court for money fraud and has 30 days before jail, but instead of finding who's responsible for this, the movie is a series of skits associating stereotypes from Kevin Hart of who would be in jail and how to react. It was boring after a while."
" I got some genuine laughs
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,5,"If you're a fan of Will Ferrell or Kevin Hart and in the right mood this is very entertaining. Many LOL moments (the shank in the head) as we follow the obscenely rich Farrell as he's convicted of fraud and sentenced to time in a maximum security prison. With a month to get his affairs in order 'James' hires Hart, a man he just assumes is an ex-con to coach him on surviving his incarceration. 'Darnell' puts James through the motions and the movie comes close to crossing the line with racism humour and a lot of buggery jokes. Although I felt they were making fun of both, whatever its a very juvenile style comedy and I got some laughs."
" Foolish, yet intelligent
",2018-02-22 00:00:00,8,"I went in with no expectations - and was pleasantly surprised. While it's a little bit too foolish at times ""Get Hard"", is an intelligent satire poking fun at society, the gap between rich and poor, racism, LGBT and the American dream in a healthy, cheerful way."
" Enjoyable, simple comedy
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Get Hard' is a straightforward comedy film - rich white guy gets sentenced to jail for fraud, asks black associate to help him prepare for prison life, hijinks ensue. Obviously, it helps when you have two great comedic leads - Ferrell as James, the meek banker, and Hart as Darnell, the car-wash operator trying to support his family. Hart's on a bit of a roll, film-wise, but this was not quite as enjoyable as 'The Wedding Ringer', but much better than 'Ride Along'.The two stars work so well together, with ultra-short Hart's hyper-energy toned down a little and ultra-tall Ferrell playing a meek, polite man-child. It's not too crass, but there is a bit of swearing as Ferrell tries to learn 'smack talk', which is hilarious. Also - too much of his butt, but that's why it's funny I guess! It's at least counter-balanced by Brie (Annie from 'Community') looking great in a corset.Plenty of laugh-out-loud moments as the 30-day countdown until his imprisonment proceeds, with some nice play on stereotypes throughout. A decent support cast - needed more Ron Funches! - not too long and just ridiculous enough to not get too stupid. Not the best comedy you'll ever see, but far from the worst."
" Got me laughing hard
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,7,"Get Hard is simple, it contains some second-level seen-before drama but handled pretty good because of the dialogue and the concept and most importantly the lead actors, if it weren't for Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell this movie would've fallen onto the abyss. But thank god, it delivered such a good experience that didn't leave so much to be desired.7/10"
" Two great comedy actors wasted on crap material
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,4,"Will Ferrell is one of my favourite actors but this has to be a low point in his career. 'Get Hard' is disappointing by any standards, but the fact that one of the best comedy actors in Ferrell is effectively wasted in such a dumb film makes it even worse. 'Get Hard' is some seriously crap material.There are some funny scenes in this film, most of them towards the end, but this is down to the actors alone and not the material. Ferrell and Hart and two naturally funny people who have an effortless ability to make people laugh and they are the only thing about this film that makes it remotely watchable. If two less talented actors worked with this material, it would have been a train wreck."
" Mayo and Chocolat...
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,6,"I had my fear that this might turn out to be just another Will Ferrell comedy, but luckily it turned out to be anything but that. ""Get Hard"" was a very funny and entertaining movie, and I must admit that I am glad that I did take the time to sit down and watch it.""Get Hard"" is about James (played by Will Ferrell) whom is framed for fraud and sentenced to go to 10 years in prison. He has 30 days to conclude his affairs before having to go to prison. He decides to get help from Darnell (played by Kevin Hart) in order to be ready for prison.The story in ""Get Hard"" was filled with funny moments and hilarious scenes, and it was so nicely brought to life on the screen by Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart.The chemistry between Ferrell and Hart is really unique and that is reflected on the screen. They act quite well opposite one another, and each compliments the other nicely on the screen. It was also nice to have Craig T. Nelson in the movie, despite of having a minor role only.I was laughing a lot throughout the course of this movie, and the comedy in ""Get Hard"" is really great.This is indeed a good comedy movie, and it is definitely well worth watching if you are looking for a proper comedy movie."
" hardcore fun
