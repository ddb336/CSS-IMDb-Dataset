" Insulting
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,1,"Crouching Tiger Hidden Tiger was a great movie. To do another related to this movie, it takes a lot when the predecessor was so famed and well conceived. But this ""sequel"" was so wrong in many ways.If you can imagine Asians acting in western cowboy movies and record your reaction of it. Then this is my reaction to this Sword Of Destiny. Never, ever, make a movie of period drama from foreign hands. And, never, ever, make the actors to speak in foreign language not befitting to the content period. Throughout the show I was thinking what were the T&C that the director Yuen Ho-Ping, Michelle Yeoh and Donnie Yen had to come up with in order to accept this proposal. To have Chinese sword fighting while conversing in English is not just bad enough, the flavour is just, like putting mayonnaise into herbal chicken. Yes again, imagine if this is Asian playing in western cowboy movie where the main protoganist is an Asian speaking in Chinese language waving a gun in a cowboy bar. Come on.And the fighting. It's definitely simpler than the original, and dare I say, simpler than what we asians see as actual wushu. It is boring, expected and obvious that it was all planned rather than an exciting counter-attack moves with quick blocks and jibes.Next, the movie development, plot and editing. It's very very Hollywood style. When it comes to period drama outside of your domain, don't add your pepper in it. Stick to the old spice. Donnie Yen in cowboy hat is a joke. Editing is mediocre. Actors were not selected wisely for the job but sure, you wanted actors who look Asian and able to speak good English for this movie. Please refer to my first paragraph.This movie is SO BAD and it tagged the award winning movie in it as a sequel. Geez."
" I Loved It
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Well acted, beautifully done. Wonderful action. I thought it was excellent."
" Traditional
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,9,I love this movie. It's like most good asain movies. It mixes love with honer and pride. Something that american movie lack. These critics are lacking love. How can you judge without love.
" Couldn't be worse than this one!
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,1,"I often thought there's conspiracy to ruin a possible money-making sequel to block the opportunity for competitors' success. This movie was a exactly proof. I don't know who approved this lousy screenplay and who hired the brain-dead director to make this movie. The storyline is so awkward and the characters to make it even worse should be an example to show how bad a movie would be and how it could reach the lowest level of movie making.
The stupid scenario obviously was copycatting from the Japanese and then later the American version of ""The Magnificent Seven"", but the script writer simply couldn't get the substance of those two movie. He just added 5 wild cards from the tavern, then added a ridiculous Donny Yen's role and an old Michelle Yang's former character, then by combining these 7 figures, he added another two younger characters from the opposite foes, two bad young actors who seemed not quite be able to decide what they should choose to do the right thing. Other than the ridiculous West Lotus vicious killer, the sword legend and legacy were also such stupid additive. Further than all of the above-mentioned crappy ingredients, the dialog was even worse, especially when it was dubbed in English, so lame and so awkward.
You don't have to fast-forward this movie if you can't stand the stupid on-going of this movie, just turn it off. Netflix has already done a lot of damage to offer so many fouled crap, we don't have to go along with it, just turn it off and forget about it."
" Flying Warriors
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,7,"Not as good as the original but a pretty good Martial Arts/Sword Fighting historical thriller. The story of the famous sword, the Green Destiny. People will kill for it, Clans go to war for it. Some characters continue from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, one ""returns from the dead"". A young woman who wants to learn the Iron Way clashes with a young man who is on the dark side but things get complicated. An intricate story of warring clans with great sword fights. both battles and individual duels. Warriors literally fly! Directed by Yuen Woo-ping, written by John Fusco. On Netflix. 7/10."
" Entertaining but not as good as the original
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,6,Unlike the original the love story here is bland and on the palate to be seen just as the movie begins. The storyline was pretty predictable and the team that joins silent wolf to save the sword with shu lien could have been casted better.Michele Yeoh was good but the storyline left much to be desired for her to exploit her acting skills. The fight scene at the end with haides Dai was very good indeed and the one on the frozen lake will be remembered undoubtedly by many.It's good to watch in your spare time and it will not bore you at all.
" Very enjoyable
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,8,"It seems that many of my fellow moviegoers hold this to a higher standard than me, but I enjoyed this film. Maybe it's because I've been subject to some real turds from Disney lately, but I found this to have a surprisingly coherent script and good acting. The fight scenes are much more art than violence, and there's a refreshing lack of Chinese propaganda."
" Some things are worth fighting for!!
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,10,Amen to that!! I Loved this movie! Its even better than the first one and i love Michelle Yeoh. She was amazing in Memoirs of a Geisha and she slayed this role!! A must see!!
" Disappointing and poorly executed
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,4,"This film really doesn't seem to have much coherence with the original film, which happens to be a masterpiece. The only reason that the sequel seem to exist it to make a quick buck off the reputation of the original.It was surprising that the film makers chose for the dialogue to be in English which further distances the mood from the original and the Australian accents seem quite jarring and make it hard to feel that the story is taking place in Qing dynasty China. Some of the actors can't even pronounce Chinese place names correctly.Add to that the complete lack of chemistry between Michelle Yeoh and Donny Yen, the overall movie seems very dull. It would have been good to bring back more than one character from the first film. I guess it is challenging since most of the main characters died in the first film. At least there could have been a flash back or something.I did enjoy the fight sequences and the landscape shots but overall it fell quite flat."
" A Mediocre Asian Sword Fighting Movie - Could Have Been Much Better
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,6,"05/06/2020 This is not a bad asian fighting movie but it far from being a great one also. Never exciting with alot of no action/lull time in the storyline which makes for a ho-hum swords and warriors movie. Worth watching, but only one time. Bon Appetit'"
" What the Heck Happened to this sequel?
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,5,"I watched Crazy Rich Asians and this film came up under the always-a-class-act Michelle Yeoh films. I had no idea they'd even made a sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, so I was very excited to watch it.Oh dear! What a hot mess.Ms. Yeoh is always such a wonderful actor, but even she can't save the lack of coherent story here. While the film starts off promising enough with some awe-inspiring landscapes and cinematography and a spectacular fight scene with Shu Lien and her caravan being attacked, both the story and action begin to drag so badly half way through. Characters appear and aren't really given much of a backstory or depth. The actors are fine, I suppose they worked with what they had, which doesn't seem to be much, and tried to do their best. Even with some inspired fight scenes, the film begins to get boring and it's such a shame! The Sword of Destiny deserved a better film to showcase it.I won't say it was a terrible film overall, there are certainly some great vistas and fight scenes to make it worth a watch, just don't high expectations. Sadly, this just felt so... constrained. Like all of the charm and mysterious dreamy quality of the original were lost."
" Another great franchise ruined
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,1,The quality is GONE. Movies are consistently on the decline and this movie is one more brick in the wall. This movie is nothing like CTHD.
" Lovely cinematography and wild fight scenes
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,8,"Sure. Ok. This movie isn't the equal of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon... but good luck finding another movie of that caliber. I found this sequel rather satisfying, particularly on a second viewing. Michelle Yeoh commandingly reprises her role and her supporting cast doesn't let her down. I don't get all the negative reviews... except in relation to the first movie and, frankly, that's not a fair comparison."
" A Chinese film with originally English speaking.
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,7,"It's so weird to see a Chinese film with English speaking. This is very different from those films I've normally seen. If it was dubbed version, yeah, it made no difference. But it's not dubbed. The original film is in English speaking and the clothes and everything are like Chinese film. I feel like this is so wrong. I must say that before I watched this film, I had no idea it would turn out to be like this. I appreciate their efforts and English is an International language, but when I saw a film like this, it really made uncomfortable. Maybe I'm not getting used to those kinds of stuffs.Except this fact, the film is highly enjoyable and the fighting on the frozen pond scene is so impressive. I really love that scene. And also the whole film is so amazing. Beautiful sceneries, perfect performances and score, awesome directing skills, excellent special effects and all made this film turned out to be a great one. The plot seems to be quite simple, but because the other things are very good, so, the film automatically turned into a great one. I don't know about the others, I really love this film and I've totally enjoyed every second of it."
" Great action
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,7,"Amazing action scenes and beautiful cinematography. The fights are choreographed beautifully and even had the added benefit of a little cinema magic to get the superhuman agility of the samurai.
The plot was easy to follow and I didn't feel like it relied to heavily on the first crouching tiger so that you could follow along even without having seen it.
Enjoyed watching."
" Watch it with the Chinese language soundtrack
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,8,"I had pretty much given up on this title after I first stumbled across it on Netflix. I started watching it in the default language, English, which, after all is what the actors were mouthing. Also, it's a Netflix offering, which are all a bit ""light"", so I was expecting they would turn it in to a formulaic happy-ending thing - more on that later. Also, how could they replace Zhang Ziyi? Well, they did, with Australian Chinese Australian actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo. They are playing different but similar characters, and they are different but similar, so all good there.
Then many months later I saw it come up again and I thought I'd try watching it with the Chinese soundtrack and it really was a different experience - the English language always sounds so hackneyed in moves - has every line of original sounding dialogue already been written? When I was watching it in Chinese, I found it to be a similar experience to the original movie, a little less subtle perhaps, right up until the end. And here was my biggest problem. She dies in the final battle, right? But then she's riding off into the sunset at the end? What happened there? So is that a spoiler or not? Anyway, a decent sequel. Not a masterpiece, but solid entertainment and better than its current 6.1 score anyway."
" Sad
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,5,Great actors and actresses filled movie but horrible story. No effort made into making the background storytelling. Cheesey dialogue and predictable.
" I really wanted to like it, but it was slow and mediocre
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,6,"Part two of a movie no one remembers from 15 years ago, it features a lot of known Asian actors who fight for right against might. And considering the lame (and obvious) way they solve the problem at the end, one wonders what was the point of the rest of the movie. There are good parts, though. The actors are all acting well, the wire-fu is OK, the costumes and sets are nice. Surprisingly, it was the fight scenes that threw me off. Supposedly great fighters either move really slow and awkward, then die stupidly, or you can see where the sword doesn't even touch the guy who dies from it. Bottom line: in a world of flawless CGI where everybody and their grandmother have superpowers, the only alternative would be Asian martial artists who treat every word and every move as part of their art. Rather than punch the villain, they move delicately to great effect and make the right move and say the right thing for the right moment. Unfortunately, this movie does NOT demonstrate this and instead fails miserably on the very points it should have been strong at."
" ""We don't hold this sword. This sword holds us.""
",2018-04-09 00:00:00,8,"Fans of the original ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" may find this follow-up to be less than inspiring, but I thought it was an adequate sequel extending the legend of the Green Sword of Destiny. I always manage to enjoy the choreography that goes into the martial arts fight scenes, even if the moves are humanly impossible. The wire work in this film may not have been as extensive as in the original but it was appropriately placed and didn't intrude on the story. The names of the four fighters who joined Silent Wolf/Meng Si Zhao (Donnie Yen) were pretty clever - Flying Blade, Thunder Fist, Silver Dart Shi and Turtle Ma, and I got a kick out of Turtle Ma's legendary status in his domain - 'this tavern'. I pretty much expected the negative reviews on this board for the movie because ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" by Ang Lee was one of those films that brought the martial arts movie to new levels when it came out in 2000. Since then we've been introduced to any number of high flying, colorful spectacles in the genre, all capitalizing on the latest in film technology and special effects. This one holds up well in that regard, keeping in mind that this one was produced by Netflix and not one of the major studios. So all in all a decent effort, and not really as bad as critics are prone to say."
" Dont bother
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,3,Not even close to the original.My motto is dont try unless its got the same director.whICH It didn't!!
" Old renewed love and young love
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,7,"This is a story about the Iron Way protecting the ""Green Sword of Destiny"" from the evil Hades Dai who has the Dragon Sword. In order to protect the sword the owners hire five fighters or so who have Uma Thurman skills so they can defeat a small army. Some have ""light body skill"" which I guess is the technical term for wearing a wire that pulls you up into the air. There is a story of an old renewed love and of a young love. There is plenty of fighting, minimal blood, and American style humor.The film is in English, no dubbing. The plot was Chinese, American style. If you are a martial arts purist, this isn't your film as gravity is a law easily broken. The drama is so-so. The cinematography was good. The main characters were a bit bland, while the minor ones took on personality. Themes of honor and redemption.
No swearing, sex, or nudity. Woman is nude from back in low light with some minor side breast shadows."
" Like an old Western in Asian setting
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,6,"I had no idea what this movie was about when I sat down to watch it on Netflix yesterday. I certainly had not watched its predecessor which, as I discovered afterwards, seems to have received quite high ratings.To me this was a fairly decent movie quite adequate for a little Monday evening TV session. I would probably have been a wee bit disappointed if I had spent money and effort to see it in a movie theater though.I did like the overall story and the cinematography. It did feel quite a bit like a old western in Asian setting. Make the sword a shipment of gold, the setting in the old west, add the hero and the gang of good guys with pistols instead of swords, do not forget the bad guy with his cronies and you have a good old fashioned Western. That is not really bad thing as far as I am concerned. The Asian setting and the Asian honor culture adds a lot of elegance to the movie.The story is plain and simple with few surprises. As tradition dictates there is plenty of Asian martial arts going on. The fights are a little on the slow side and clearly intended for a rather low content rating. You never see anyone get really hurt. Sure people die but the deaths are quite bloodless. Personally I would have preferred a bit more hard hitting action. The fights almost became a bit comical at times.I would say that the characters are okay. Not the best actors I have seen but I found them to be adequate. I did like the good guys. The bad guy could have done with a bit more charisma and the witch or whatever she was supposed to be felt underwhelming and underdeveloped.One thing that annoyed me was this unrealistic flying around by some of the characters. Sure, it looked somewhat cool and very elegant but come on! Suddenly it appeared like the character became weightless and just floated through the air. Not very convincing.On the whole I did enjoy the movie but, as I indicated above, it was not really a wow kind of movie. I have actually added the predecessor to my shopping list since that one got so good reviews. Speaking of reviews, on all the review sites I have looked this movie gets a rating of about 6 out of 10. Of course one site just had to stand out. Rotten Tomates! Their so called ""critics"" gave it a rotten rating with an abysmal score of 19%. What the f? I know those self appointed ""art"" critics are too full of themselves to be taken seriously but that is a new low. Anyway, end of rant!"
" An adequate movie, just don't think of it as a sequel...
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,6,"Now, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny"" had some mighty big shoes to fill out as a direct sequel to the fantastic ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" from 2000. And I will say that while it didn't really manage to step up to the plate and deliver on something just as grand as the 2000 movie, then it was still an enjoyable movie in its own rights.And it is perhaps a better way to look at ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny"" as a stand-alone movie and try not to tie it to its predecessor.There was a lot of good action sequences throughout the movie, with good choreography and in-your-face kind of action. And that really worked out well in favor of the movie. It should also be said that the martial arts sequences in the movie were great, and they were as nicely executed on the screen as they were choreographed.The storyline in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny"", however,"" turned out to be adequate. It wasn't as outstanding, memorable or original as it was in the first movie. Sure, it was entertaining enough, but it just seemed like the creative balloon was starting to deflate.However, the characters in the movie were one-dimensional, lacking both depth and personalities. It was hard to differentiate between the individual characters and tell where one character ended and the other began. They could essentially have been replaced with animated cardboard cut-outs.The ending of the movie was so predictable that you just saw it coming a mile away. Actually, it was so predictable that it only served as a blow to the credibility of the movie.One thing that the movie had working for it was the cast, as they had managed to get a good ensemble of acting talents to participate in this project. Donnie Yen and Michelle Yeoh were of course the big names to pull in the audience, and they fared well enough with their roles in the movie. It was a shame that Eugenia Yuan didn't have a bigger part or more on-screen time, because I would have loved to see more of her talent, plus her role was a very interesting one - a character not fully utilized in the movie. I was surprised to see Jason Scott Lee in a movie such as this, as I didn't think he was still an active actor, and much less expected him to show up in a movie such as this. If you forget that ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny"" is directly tied as a sequel to the 2000 movie, then it actually serves as a decent enough movie in its own rights. But once you start holding it up in comparison to the predecessor, then ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny"" pales instantly in comparison."
" Old School
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,7,"A kind of a throwback with characters that may remind you of Shaw Brothers movies. So it tries to combine the old with some new stuff. Especially the fact that this was filmed in English may alienate some people. But overall I do believe it works. It does have a returning Michelle Yeoh (ageless) who is great in this too. In addition we get Donnie Yen and his craftsmanship.The action choreography is good and there is flying again (so if you didn't like the first one or thought it was ridiculous and ""unreal"", don't watch this either). The story is simple and while Yeoh's character admits that at one point, she almost redacts her point entirely at the end. Some may say she changed her mind. Whatever it is, the movie is more than decent enough, while never reaching the heights of the original (no pun intended)."
" Expectedly disappointing sequel
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,5,"The usual good performance from Michelle Yeoh and a decent supporting cast cannot make much out of this rather dull martial arts sequel. The main problem is in the butchered story and so there are lots of spoilers here, all in the last-but-one paragraph.The acting is reasonable enough, Jason Scott Lee looks good as the bad guy, the simple plot at least makes sense and things move along at a good pace. Cinematography is fine, though it doesn't match the original. The characters are less interesting here though and Donnie Yen, while better than Chow Yun Fat in the fight scenes, has never been much of an actor. The great problem is the storyline. Supposedly based on Wang Dulu's Crane-Iron Pentalogy, actually the script bears little relationship to the novels and has clearly been written to accommodate Yen as a star name (his character dies early on in the book series). There is a kind of symmetry about wuxia fiction which should not be disturbed. A westerner's butchering of a Chinese story is never likely to work in this genre and this particular carve-up feels entirely wrong.At the end it's stated that Vase avenged her teacher. This is what should have happened but she wasn't allowed to. Wolf fighting Dai was inappropriate. So he had earlier thrown a fight against him – what kind of reason is that for revenge? Vase should also have been the principal in the pursuit of Wei Fang, as she was the one to lose the sword to him, and Wolf could have supported her with this. Meanwhile, Wolf should have been allowed to take his own revenge on Mantis who, in the course of the movie, had killed every one of his friends. Shu Lien, throughout the crescendo and climax, is left with nothing worthwhile to do and the strand about her teaching Vase leads nowhere. Vase should have mastered some skill which allowed her to defeat Dai and make sense of his earlier instruction to allow her to become 'worth killing'. Instead we see Shu using the skill she seems to have failed to teach to Vase. I did however like the switching of weapons in the fight and Dai's final line.Those who prefer westernised versions of Chinese martial arts to the real thing, may find this entertaining enough to be worth the time, but don't hope for anything nearly as good as CTHD."
" Basic kung fu flick, best seen as not a sequel.
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,6,"So, Netflix take on the sequel to Ang Lee's original 2000 spectacle which gladly reached a much wider, international audience for a martial art movie. It continues of the sword and fantasy during the Qing dynasty being central to Michelle Yeoh's Yu Shu Lien and this time, Donnie Yen playing the complicated romantic interest. He's not replacing Yun-Fat Chow's Li Mu Bai, of course not, but is simply another character thrown into the fray. The actually phrase ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was first coined by the Chinese poet, Yu Xin, and is sometimes use to refer to the real life military strategist and philosopher, Zhuge Liang or sometimes known as Kongming, the same guy who invented the fashionable lanterns that people release into the sky. Being symbolic of a true master in hiding, possibly waiting. Almost like Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars. But I'm not entirely sure who it's referring to in the film. The legendary Woo Ping Yuen, director of many Kung fu classics such as The Drunken Master and fight choreographer for The Matrix returns to direct this sequel. I say return as he was, of course, the fight choreographer for Ang Lee's previous film, The fighting is exceptionally creative, fantastic and plentiful but that shouldn't be too surprising with Woo Ping at the helm. The wire work is unfortunately too obvious, some of the fighting being comical but pays homage to the classic Kung Fu's of old and on the whole, beautifully executed and captured. Michelle Yeoh returns and as always, does impressively well considering she is not trained in the martial arts. Hong Kong superstar Donnie Yen does what he does best and is in no means a disappointment to watch him in action playing Silent Wolf. (Makes you think of Chuck Norris yes?) But it was great to see Jason Scott Lee, though much older than Disney's Mowgli and the Bruce Lee he played in Dragon. Shigeru Umebayashi does a grand score, respecting traditional music of the orient and creating a strong sense of mysticism and fantasy. Something to be noted about this film is the spoken language. Being filmed in English because surprisingly, Ang Lee's film insulted much of the mandarin speaking world, convincing the studios to choose an English dialogue so not to repeat the same mistake. Only three of the four key characters in Ang Lee's film actually spoke fluent mandarin. Whilst it's a good film, it has loss the majestic gracefulness the first film had, a certain elegance and finesse, but as a stand alone martial art picture, it's good enough and very enjoyable.

" Good Wuxia
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"Not a masterpiece like the first, but a solid movie. It lacks the magic elegance of Ang Lee's film, but, although the original language is English, it feels somehow more authentically Chinese.In a world were evil is real and eternal, an unavoidable aspect of human destiny, the baddies are more than caricatures, tragic figures themselves. I may add that I have a feeble for Asian ""femmes fatales"", so that the duo Blind Enchantress (Eugenia Yuan) and Mantis (Veronica Ngo) proved irresistible.Add to that a couple of technically memorable fight scenes, some good jokes and the movie, despite its recurrent clumsiness, raises unmistakably above mediocrity."
