" Beautiful Dystopian Love Story
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,10,"I'll be honest, when I first started watching Equals, it seemed pretty slow. But then I realized, that's exactly what a dystopian society would look like with no emotion...and then I was totally sucked in. This movie is beautifully made with a score that goes from ambient to electrifying in perfect sync with the actors. I loved the simplicity of this story (even though the haters here wanted another cliche sci-fi with overdone special effects). Watch this movie if you're looking for a thought-provoking futuristic love story. You won't be disappointed!"
" Slow burn but very emotional
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,"I love Nicholas Hoult. I thought he was amazing in this film. I'm not gonna lie though, I was a bit sceptical when starting this movie but as it progressed I couldn't seem to stop watching. I found this movie very emotional and it stuck with me for days. Definitely worth the watch!"
" Could have been so much better
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,6,"Very similar film to Equalibrium but not nearly as good. The actors are good , not sure why character Nia has excessively greasy hair? It was very difficult to hear what anyone was saying as they all whispered or had low volume voices and the music was dreadful. The story had potential but it had a pretty miserable ending. I think 6 is fair. My oartner thought it was 90 minutes of his life he wont get back."
" Stylish and boring
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,4,"Halfway through it on TV. Nicholas Hoult is gorgeous to look at, and the production design is chic. Fun to see Dark Shadows star David Selby again after all these years. Kristen Stewart has a flat monotone voice in every film...she is so boring here and in everything else I have ever struggled through with her.The only point of light is Guy Pearce, who is incredibly charismatic and so far has only had one brief scene which perked me up. I was about to change the channel but have stuck with it but if Guy doesn't come back soon, I'm done.1984 and Brave New World sans the intelligence of Orwell and Huxley. Style over substance, as always...."
" Makes you think...until the poor sound engineering gets intolerable
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,5,"Interesting storyline. Romeo and Juliet-esque. Makes you think.
Unfortunately, the horrible sound engineering ruins the experience."
" Not completely terrible but use your time more wisely
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,3,"As others have rightly identified, the premise of a future where 'emotions are blamed for everything, so emotions are banned' has been done many times before and much better.That an actress ridiculed for her lack of ability to convey emotion is one of the only ones in the film to experience emotions is, at the very least, an interesting casting choice. Then again, those experiencing emotions have to try to hide them and any emotion portrayed is more than shown by the conformists-so perhaps an inspired choice for the film and for a vehicle for the actress after all.The end was all too predictable but reached so slowly after being telegraphed. This would have been better as a 13m art short."
" This is why we are here...
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,9,"Beautiful movie, nothing more to say since I can't really speak right now after watching this emotional peace of art movie"
" Derivative, boring, a waste of a good cast
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,5,"Today seems to be the day of derivative movies. I've just seen another that was just following the genre rules without bringing nothing else to the table. Equals is just like that. The classic dystopia in which emotions are culturally and medically removed and people are all dressed the same bland colors and the young beautiful people who rediscover what it means to feel. It doesn't matter how much they love each other or how elaborate are the sets or how well the actors do their job is the movie is as bland as the white clothes everybody's wearing. If you like the subject, watch Brave New World, which is slightly better."
" Most boring movie ever created
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,1,If you take out the action from Equillibrium this is the trash you end up with. There is no drama or suspense or horror or comedy either. Just nothingness. 2 people non stop yapping about how theyre scared of the nothingness in the movie
" Kristen Stewart
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,7,Not my favorite Kristen Stewart movie but that being said it still well worth the watch. Love these futuristic films. I love Kristen Stewart
" Wow... All the feels.
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,"I am NOT a sci-fi fan in the slightest so it took me a while to watch this, only to find that the sci-fi takes a backseat to what really is a heart wrenchingly beautiful love story. The two leads knock it outta the park with chemistry. They play their characters so well and captivate you. Kristen Stewart is magnificent and I've always liked Nicholas Hoult.The fact that I finished this movie 20 mins ago and I'm still affected tells me that this is a well written and and excellently made gem. I'm left slightly traumatised, hopeful and my imagination is rampant with possibility."
" ""Love: Crime Against Society""
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,5,"Decent watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.Don't get me wrong, I like the movie, but it is HIGH concept, low execution, despite being a beautifully produced and shot flick.Nicholas Hoult and Kristen Stewart carry the movie, and for those haters Stewart is playing a girl that is not supposed to show emotions so there, but there are some solid actors in support roles as well: Guy Pearce (Memento), Bel Powley (Carrie Pilby), and David Selby (who I thought was Alan Alda from MASH: This was like a Mandela effect: I had his voice in my head.)There just isn't a lot that is actively interesting to watch a movie where everyone is a robot without emotion, but it is a cool concept, especially when it becomes a survival concept. People who can't manage their emotions as if they don't have them get sent to a place where they're basically electro-shocked into committing suicide if they hadn't beforehand.The tension of it definitely ramps up a bit, but the focus eventually becomes more on the romantic connection than survival, even during a part primarily focused on surviving.The last couple of scenes are really subtle too, I actually had to re-watch them to just to make sure I knew how it ended.So while I like it and there is definitely something to like here, I think less people than more are going to be into it."
" Equilibrium
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,1,"This is just the do-gooder version of Equilibrium. Lame, over-emotional, slow and boring."
" Sadness of a Socialist Society
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,5,"This is a very emotional movie where emotions are banned to make people more in line with the biddings of the state run society. That's not a spoiler since that's the synopsis given.Oddly enough, watching it now in 2020, it hits home in the way that we are being forced to follow the state's bidding by wearing masks and keeping away from each other and not being in large groups together. Going against the will of the state is now punishable. So much for freedom.The movie really hits home in that respect. Hopefully our future is not going to be that way, but you can see the trending. Especially troubling is how many young people would support a socialist society yet would hate where it will end up. Read or watch Orwell's 1984 for an in depth approach.Not a bad movie. I felt the characters didn't really gel, but maybe that was part of the feel of the movie - very sterile and bland. Everyone wearing white was almost comical, but in this new world order I guess that makes sense."
" A long and boring Black Mirror episode.
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,3,"Too much 'romance'. A dystopian story that could have been told in 10 minutes. Nothing sci-fi is explained anyways. Everything just is, deal with it.Funny how they made Kristen Stewart, an actress who can't act, not act since in this movie has no feelings. But she has. Maybe. Not that it matters, like at all."
" Bland like the world it depicts.
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,4,"TLDR: go watch 'The Lobster' instead. Or ""Her"" if you haven't. The screen play here is so by the numbers it actually hurts to watch. The movie takes no risks, preferring to play it safe complete with a feel good ending that defies the logic it set out so far.Hilarious to see this being ranked the same as 'vivarium' when vivarium actually had a both a message and the guts to deliver a meaningful ending. Anyways, 4/10, passable sci fi love story."
" target audience???
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,7,"Well if you are a guy you're going to love sci fi movies with lots of action, or you can even enjoy the super slow pace of THX-1138 but I don't know if you are going to like Equals but maybe your girlfriend, sister or mom will, so give it a try with an open mind and don't expect much action here but maybe get ready for some tears.
PS> reviewing this in 2020 its very scary what is happening where government has more control over us by giving us a false sense of security (safety) in exchange for giving away our rights so the line between science fiction and reality is starting to blur"
" What was that?
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,3,I feel like I've just watched two people breathe very loudly in the dark for 101 minutes. What was that??
" Very similar to the THX-1138 and Equilibrium
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,5,"Very similar to THX-1138. It could almost be said to be a remake. Also with points of contact with the Equilibrium.It is more or less interesting, although the moments of pause and slow action are not fully achieved. It is not an action movie."
" Cats is better than this
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,2,"Equals writers: Hey, can I copy your homework?Shakespeare: Yeah, just change a few things so that it doesn't look like you just copied it.Equals writers: Sure thing, we'll just add our awful script into it."
" Let me tell you something.
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,7,"*** No spoilers here. No not yet. I'll tell you when. ***Can't we just get rid of the constant beeping that beeps everytime when someone interacts with a screen, a scanner, a door, a shower or a person? The same annoying sound is used over and over again throughout the movie, even in the background music. This is VERY **beep**Cast: perfect.
Acting: perfect.
Chemistry between characters: perfect.
Directing: some close-up shots of people who are showering longer and more often than they probably should.Topic: interesting, but nothing new.
Flow: painfully sloooooooooow.World building, sets, decors: Everything's white. That means the future.
Music, soundtrack: meh.
Sound effects: **beep**
****** SPOILERS BELOW *******When I hear the announcement about ""being chosen for pregnancy"" every 5 minutes, i can predict that the lead female character will be chosen for pregnancy near to the end of the movie.I can predict that the male character will get his emotions erased near to end of the movie.I can predict lots of things in this movie.No, i'm not an oracle.The movie is predictable."
" It ended right when it started to get really good
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,7,Good movie but the most disappointing ending!! It took so long to build the world and the character's story lines that by the time I was invested and wanting to see what happens it ends. I wont spoil it for anyone but I think the real story is what happens next. I need a sequel!!
" Pointless
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,3,"Its a great cast and it seemed promising, but no. There's no story, no explaining of the ""rules"", no back story, no start, no middle, no ending. I don't get the point."
" Terrible film, couldn't even get through it
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,3,"I began this film with the intention that it would be good. The idea is smart and had a lot of potential to be a good film but the cast was atrocious. Perhaps it was the acting. Nothing against Kristin Stewart, I think she's great but sometimes her resting sad, bored, tired face gets on my nerves. Even when things were fine I couldn't help but just frown as I watched the movie. 99.9/100 times I would finish a movie but this film was just so terrible I found myself skipping and yawning. There were no memorable lines or scenes and I felt like the only lines said were ""good morning nia"" ""good night nia"" vice versa etc. It dragged and it was filled with just whispers and I understand in this future they can't show feelings but I was just so bored! Safe to say I will never be wasting my time on this film again."
" Good, but nothing new
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,7,"It takes inspiration from ""Gattaca"", ""Equilibrium"", ""1984"", ""Brave New World"" and such... But it has nothing new to add.It embedds a love story in an audiovisually very pleasing frame. But story-wise it has not too much to offer, unfortunately."
" Interesting story / very underrated
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,8,"I truly enjoyed the whole movie. Puzzles me why this movie has a low score. Interesting story and good acting, not much more you could ask for. Highly recommend it."
" Blah Blah Blah We've Seen It All Before
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,3,"Besides IMDB REQUIRING so many words, I could package this vanilla, boring, irritating movie up in a sentence. This is the SAME sterile, futuristic, anti emotion/ Family movie as every other drama packaged as Sci-fi, and they spend a mind - numbing amount of time in sterile white rooms telling no story and just making the viewer want to commit Hari Kari if that is to be our future!"
" Not for You unless You are in Love
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,7,"It has been a while since watched for the first time. Today again felt like watching.Not a huge fan of Kristen or Nicolas. Most of the time they are too dull on screen. But cannot think of anyone who could do better for this movie. They both pose so much energy. Thousands of silent emotions without dialogues to describe them. Everything felt so real. The idea of 'being wrong with falling in love' is so touching.Adore the bold background and white details inside it; the camera shots to highlight their expression. How they feel when touching each other, and the magnetic lines when getting close to each other. They are so real. Even in 2019, we have some occasions that we cannot express our feelings and emotions towards someone, cause society forces us to be numb over it.Can say, a much great work. So far the best acting of both the actors. It does not matter where it comes from. Anyone can still enjoy what you see. A truly romantic Sci-fi."
" A familiar scenario lovingly rendered...
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,8,"From whence the indifference towards this movie? The story is familiar by now, it's true:; a society borne in chaos determines to maintain stability by suppressing impulsive behavior (read: emotion) at all costs. But loving and thoughtful execution has yielded a deeply affecting result. Kristen Stewart is perfect in her role as she is truly adept at portraying restrained internal turmoil. Nicholas Hoult and the balance of the cast descend to the occasion, as it were. The austere but striking locations perfectly convey the utopian aspirations of this earnest new society while revealing, in their uniformity, the very shortcomings inherent in the model. The crystalline, narcotic score accomplishes much the same effect when ambient, but it becomes another character when our heroes engage. It's reticent and distractible when uncertainty prevails, but unfurls with shimmering vitality and audacity under the heady influence of true love.The pacing follows pretty much the same choreography and by this point you can see that a harmony among the disciplines has been achieved in the production of this film. I can't claim to know which expectations were disappointed for others, but I was touched by the subtle performances and the carefully deliberate construction of the world these characters inhabited. Sigh."
" I was deeply moved
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,10,"The premiss would be considered predictable, but the ending makes it a 10.
It is a powerful and philosophical love story that make us wonder about the meaning of life and the importance of love. I do not understand why some people did not appreciate this movie. Any movie that makes you feel deep emotion and leave you in an altered emotional state deserves high praise. This movie achieves this and for this I give it the ultimate mark. I don't care about what intellectual critics would say. It is my belief that any movie's ultimate goal is to provide emotion. The rest is secondary. Equals delivers."
" Skip It
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,3,"It was not a touching romance story, and the way how Nicholas fall in love with Kristen was stupid, the idea was the Same idea of ""the giver"" about emotionless community, so nothing new in the overall story, it was boring and predictable, save your time and skip it"
" Seen it all before
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,3,"EQUALS is yet another dystopian sci-fi flick with the same plot as many others. It's once again a society where emotion has been suppressed, only for two young people to fall in love anyway. Lead Nicholas Hoult does his best with the material given, but Kristen Stewart is as annoying as ever and established actors like Guy Pearce wasted in support. The story is slow and miserably digital looking, dragging on and on until a climax borrowed from Shakespeare; virtually any other film in this genre, like EQUILIBRIUM for example, is more interesting."
" Dystopian Sci-Fi , sharing familiar story lines from classics like Romeo & Juliet about forbidden love.
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,9,"In an emotionless utopia, two people fall in love when they regain their feelings from a mysterious disease, causing tensions between them and their society.Kristen Stewart and Nicholas Hoult star in this Scott Free Films production featuring Guy Pearce, Jacki Weaver, Bel Powley . Executive producer, Ridley Scott.I must say I sought this film out for actress Kristen Stewart. She is insanely beautiful .I could watch this film on mute and just be struck by the visuals, even if Doremus's hand-held camerawork doesn't make a ton of sense-at least he shows his stars off to advantage.A movie about suppressing your emotions will make you pretty emotional if your mindset allows you to. Yes, it is slow, has little or no action, just sheer human emotion, drama and situation.This is an intriguing, fascinating story that leaves the viewer with mixed emotions. What would we prefer, a pristine, harm-free society in which emotion is subdued, or one full of emotion, beauty... and the pain brought about by those emotions?This film both answers and refuses to answer that question. It presents a story, leaving us to determine which we would prefer. The story is well-crafted, has enough twist to surprise, and an ending that satisfies without preaching.The futuristic atmosphere in Equals, along with its style and themes of love & passion bears a resemblance to Gattaca (1997) for its look & feel, while also sharing familiar story lines from classics like Romeo & Juliet about forbidden love.Drake Doremus is a brilliant filmmaker capable of reaching the viewer in a deeply emotional way. Thank you!"
" No one talks about the pills...
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't expecting much from this film. Boy was I surprised. I loved it. I loved this story. I loved the characters' chemistry. The actors were superb in bringing that chemistry to life. I cried, multiple times, and I didn't expect to, and in those moments I felt like I was living in that world, strucken inexplicably with the SOS.How to talk about it without spoilers... Okay:I understand why some people dislike this movie. It's supposedly a ""re-hashing of"" (insert favorite dystopian novel I.e., 1984). The thing is, before 1984 (1949), there was Brave New World (1932), and before that there was We (Yevgeny Zamyatin's lesser talked about novel with the same themes, 1924), and so on and so forth. Maybe it is, a bit. Just a bit.So this is a similar world. So what? The story is different. The details are different.It IS a commentary on society, yes, like the others. But in my opinion, the main difference is that this is a commentary on a society that wants specifically to denormalize humanity and emotion, as a sustainable environment opposite of the emotional past that led to a catastrophic war. This is NOT a commentary on control or ""Big Brother"" like the afore mentioned.On a smaller scale, I think this is a commentary on the way we treat mental illness. The warning symptoms of the disease (or what we might call, emotion), are only negative symptoms that come with a healthy balance life: depression, extreme elation, anger, anxiety, etc. Scientists are struggling to find the cure, but in the meantime, if you are diagnosed, don't worry, just take these suppressor pills (anti-depressants much?). Another potential breakdown of society is the surgence of mental illness. I wondered as I read other reviews, why aren't they talking about these pills and the message of the cure? That's a huge theme. I won't reveal anymore. (It's hard to write reviews without spoilers!)Others also complained a retelling of Romeo and Juliet. It is a tiny bit R & J, which I didn't realize until about three quarters through (I didn't read reviews or watch previews before watching this), but I have to honestly say, even given that realization, I did not expect the ending. In fact, from the moment of the climax (I don't want to spoiler, you'll know when you get there) until the last scene, I was kept guessing. I appreciate that because from that moment, I kept waiting for the predictable ends and to be disappointed, and though some of the details were predictable, all of them weren't and the whole surely wasn't, and I was definitely not disappointed!I'll also say that if you find it slow-moving, it really picks up speed in the last half hour (or third act) of the film.Although I am a lover of the post-apocalyptic AND dystopian society genre, I still wasn't expecting a whole lot from this film. I expected I'd be entertained. But that's about it. But instead(Again,) I loved this film. I loved this story. I loved the characters' chemistry. The actors were superb in bringing that chemistry to life. I cried, multiple times, and I didn't expect to, and in those moments I felt like I was living in that world, strucken inexplicably with the SOS.I hope you love it, too. I gave it a 9 because I reserve 10s for movies and shows that I enjoy so completely, I watch over again handfuls of times (e.g., the first six seasons of The Walking Dead, The Office US series, The Lord of The Rings trilogy, Moulin Rouge)."
" Stuck like a magnet..
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,"You won't believe me that I'm writing this review 2 years after I watched this movie and I regret that for whatever reason, but the memory of this movie is so fresh that every single time I hear the soundtrack I get a glimpse of the characters and what was happening in the scene. This is a very very very underrated movie and I recommend everyone just to go watch it and don't believe the haters or the ratings in IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes. Don't miss it !"
" Dystopia Now
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,9,"This movie is not about some imagined dystopian future, although it is that on the surface. If you can't identify with SOS then you are brain dead, much like the majority of the characters in the film, and in your everyday life. People don't have labels on them in this movie, just like in real life. And much like religion, social conformity, and so on, Equals is pounding away at what it means to be human: individuals are destroyed by supposed ""equality"" and coercive conformity. If everybody eats and dresses alike, has the same goals, and ""agrees"" on the purpose of life/society then you have North Korea, ISIS, and every other historical dystopia that has in fact existed and are existing. So you have to ask yourself ""am I living this movie?"" That is scary for unthinking people. So it is genuinely a horror story as much as Sci-fi. This movie imagines a future where good intentions - survival of humanity - pave the road to the hellish world where humans are less than human. And that is the living truth of today."
" Boring and very slow
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,1,"Do not waste your time watching this film . The film concept had potential but unfortunately the plot was thin and no action. The film focused to much on close-up shots of the actors and the colourless "" futuristic "" architecture."
" Disgraceful to the Movie Industry
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,2,"I watched this movie at 10:49 on New Year's eve. I can safely say if this movie represents my new year in any way, I'm hella screwed. I can't tell what is the worse part of this movie, the drastic plot holes or every creative choice the director made. The only part of this movie that makes me give it two stars is the use of symbolism throughout. However, the only word that comes to mind when I think of this movie is disgraceful."
" Losing that loving feeling
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,3,"Equals is set in a futuristic Dystopian society after a war has caused devastation. People are dressed in white, work and live in a minimalist sterile environment and show no emotion.Nicholas Hoult's Silas works as an illustrator of a sort in his workplace. He starts to exhibits feelings and is diagnosed with SOS (Switched Off Syndrome.) It has no cure yet and sufferers are monitored for its progress.Silas falls for fellow worker Nia (Kristen Stewart.) She also has SOS but decides to hide it in order to save herself from further trouble. The two lovers must keep their feelings hidden. With the support of an underground group they plan to escape to the peninsula.Equals is beautiful to look at, absolutely antiseptic. It was filmed in Japan and Singapore and it looks amazing with the neo architecture in the lush forestry background.The trouble is after the opening minutes, the film whose subject matter is lack of emotions becomes a snooze fest. The film wants to make a provocative point about repressed societies but it soon becomes turgid."
" How did this get a 6.1 out of 10? It deserves a solid 8.
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,8,"This was quite touching. Both actors also pulled out some very powerful acting, beautiful music too. I liked it a lot"
" It messed with my emotions
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,8,"There were a lot of parts about this movie that I didn't like. I'm tempted to give it a 7. Then I remember the way that it affected me emotionally, and I have to bump up the score. It made me think, and made me very sad. I feel a little traumatized at this point, but for me, that's a good thing."
" Love it or hate it I guess
",2018-12-11 00:00:00,8,"I think this is a movie where you either love it or hate it. I loved it needless to say.
The film itself is quite slow and for the first portion of the movie very dull to look at which reflects just how perfect the society they live in is. Once the colors start showing up and the music kicks in though you're hooked.
The story is one we've all seen before, but it still was done well and seems fresh in this movie. The romance is slow at first but then goes full force as you watch two people experience love for the first time in their lives.Even if you hated this movie you have to admit that its beautiful to look at and the music really helps set the tone."
" Hmmmm
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,3,"This film immediately brought to mind two things. First, a great film released in 1971 called THX 1138. Thx was directed by George Lucas and this was also his first film. The similarities between the two are quite obvious.Second, i once read a short srory called The Machine Stops written by E.M. Forester which was published in 1928, and again there are glaringly obvious similarities.Both mentioned are things i highly recommend watching and reading. What is really astonishing is the book, having been written in 1928 the author actually describes what we know today as tablets/ cellphones, the device described in the book allowed people to video chat despite vast physicsl distance between them, and seriously really really worth the read!!!
Anyways I will give this movie a chance regardless. Much love!"
" Been way done before. Gattaca 2.0
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,4,"Although it was very well done from start to finish- we've seen these movies before. Every 10 years, it seems."
" Emotions are they necessary?
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,7,This was actually quite an interesting movie period with the effects of emotions on a human and how they can be both positive and negative. The movie depicts the essence of what an emotion can be and how it affects mankind. With our world being very controlling and suppressing of most things that used to be free it's an interesting concept portrayed in a very dramatic and emotional manner.With a phew of the people in this oppressive existence starting to feel and emotion the lead and the female actress find it hard to stay apart with a few twists regarding suicide and birthrights I found that the movie was both interesting from a conceptual point and also dramatic from its plot. Slow in the beginning it did have its moments with the ending being very powerful
" Have you ever seen a movie shower were they weren't washing their hair?
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,4,"Look at that rebel with the horizontal and vertical stripes!Illustrator? That is pushing it in this society.Keanu Reeves is to Johnny Mnemonic as Kristen Stewart is to Equals. With a different kind of ""action"".Light brown shirt. Must be Friday night.Poor user experience... that sound will become overwhelming at rush hour.He washes his hair too frequently. Is this how he rebels?Oh no. Everyone will notice my reddish bump.Unisex bathrooms. I knew it.At least the trains are clean.Socks are evil here too.You're going to live pal :)
Welcome to the party pal.These are iPad Prooooooooos.Good thing his pants are white.The secret lives of feelings.I don't know which is worse."
" Its We by Zamyatin w 1984 mixed w THX1138 and love.
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,9,"This will be short . There is nothing wrong w dystopian novels and movies. I recently read WE by Yevgeny Zamyatin . This movie has some similarities to it . Read the book it actually predates 1984 by Orwell. Some may say Orwell definatly read it. But I digress . The look is THX 1138, the plot very WEish. Now for the film itself, being a fan of this genre , I love it. Why the 9 ? It's a little seen it before like but don't let that deter you, it's great in alot of ways . So if your in a thinking man's syfy mood then watch it. We need more of those. It's a movie where emotion is a disease and you will get quite emotional."
" Clumsy
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,5,"I liked this better when it was called THX-1138.This film tries to use dialog to demonstrate the conflict between and within characters but it's a clumsy attempt. In a dystopian world where emotions are a sign of terminal brain disease the reactions of people in society are inconsistent. The initial reaction of the protagonist's peer group is to state that he should be isolated, even shunned. Yet there is no societal mechanism to accomplish this presumably widespread and normal response to someone who exhibits emotions.Instead, one if his most vocal critic turns out to be a co-sufferer who has managed to hide her condition. It would have been interesting to see her try to sacrifice him in an attempt to stay hidden (people in this society spend their entire lives in social isolation) but instead both people rush headlong into a relationship; something that should be alien and repulsive to them.So there are no signs of self-loathing or shame that society would have conditioned in to these people and we don't get to see them struggle to overcome those impositions. Nor is there an exploration of these forbidden emotions as an addiction, with the accompanying self-destructive impulses. There are again attempts to signal this with dialog, but again we should *see* the effects. (This is a film, after all!)There are other, better films that explore the concept of emotions in a society where emotions are a sign of illness or as defects."
" Equal-what does it mean?!
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,10,"What I like most about this movie is the philosophy behind it... that took me a while to realized how wonderful it was. Right when it's ended, I was like ""really?"" I stopped a few times and at one point I decided not to continue watching it. Why? Similar to what other reviewers said here, it's slow and the volume was so low that it bothered me of what they really said. Not until I took the time a few minutes later after the movie ended to put together my thought. I suddenly realized how wonderful the concept was-we want to feel and love, but feeling and love hurt and then we suppress them by creating the emotionless state of being hoping it helps equalize society as well as feeling. And just as everyday life goes on, feelings fluctuate, people make mistakes, some are confused, and we continue to find what helps us heal-here the emotionless pills. This what makes the title perfectly crafted- EQUAL!"
" THX 1138 anyone?
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,8,"First of all I very much liked this film. It's alway lovely to watch two symmetrically perfect human beings enjoy each other and allow us to watch. Kristen Stewart is an underrated actress with the potential of great things and I hope to enjoy her more. Nicholas Hoult is a beautiful man and a very good actor who is developing well.
This film is, however, an incredible rip off of George Lucas' first film, THX 1138. How the film makers weren't sued I don't know. The near future is blandly gorgeous with ""clean"" humans whose only dread is obsolescence by way of our frailty as emotional, thoughtful creatures.. This has been bred out of us however genetics is a persistent and ever evolving pesky little demon which has weakened our ability to resist the aforementioned weakness of emotions. We witness two intelligent but remorselessly bland individuals slowly realize that they are inflected with emotion. Unfortunately those that can not fight it are doomed to the DEN where they are ruthlessly tortured and persuaded to kill themselves. Both Hoult, ""Silas"" and Stewart ""Nia"" fall in love and the plot then revolves on them getting away with it and getting away. There is good supporting drama from Guy Pierce and the wonderful Jacki Weaver but I am haunted by the future always being shades of grey with the only hope being that of escape. I loved THX 1138 when I was a very young film lover and I remember it. Which is why I liked Equals. I only hope it was meant as a homage. However I don't think I will remember it."
" Powerful
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,8,"The plot was predictable and underwhelming. However, the acting was phenomenal. The real achievement of this movie was its ability to make the audience feel the emotion of the characters."
" Well...
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,6,"Listen I love utopia (actually dystopia) novels and movies, easily one of my favorite settings. And this one has everything going for it. Beautiful setting, beautiful costumes, strict social rules, characters you cannot wait to get to know, a setting you really want to get lost in. The movie begins by introducing you to all these things and then... well.The music is lovely, really matches the mood. And the conflict is clearly there between our main character vs society, our love interest vs society, individuals vs society. There are even a handful of characters who come around in a way to make you think, 'oh that person is clearly gonna cause an issue.' The main plot builds and builds and just when the movie really gets to a point where you are getting sucked in, nothing.Those characters you were sure were going to cause trouble are nowhere to be found. Society never really gets a back story so you don't know who actually is running the whole thing or what actually happened to get them to that point. Right when things seem like they are building up there's suddenly, 'oh look we created a cure now everyone can go back to normal k byeee ' The little group of heroes that we saw growing suddenly gets put back in the hivemind and end. Our main two characters literally just found out something huge that really changes a lot (I won't give that secret away) and it's treated mostly as, 'eh yeah that happened, moving on...' We don't learn about the societies possibly outside the city walls, we don't have any idea what happens to our lovers, we assume I suppose that with a cure society is forever now hivemind and there will never be individuals again. There's a moment at the very end that gives you hope for them but then what? The movie ends.All in all it's like they had a good script, a good story, hell you could easily see this as a 2 or 3 part series but then they decided to just cut the story into 1/3 and throw a sorta ending on."
" Nice try.
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,6,"I have to give credit to the filmmakers. They tried their best. However it's not great. It has pacing issues and simply isn't that dramatic. If you want to see how this kind of story should be done watch 
the masterpiece THX1138 (1971). That's how you do it."
" Boring
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,3,I found the movie very boring and as a waste of hour and half from my life. On the paper the story sounds very good but on the screen it's was boring.
" Potentially the most dull film I've ever watched
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,3,"I really struggled to stay awake with this one. I get what the message is, but it's too dragged out and dull. The idea is good, although already done in other films. It's well acted, although Kristen's mostly just doing the same sad face as in throughout Twilight. I couldn't understand a load of dialogue as they were speaking so dully. And the music score is dull."
" Watched it because of reviews saying it was underrated...
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,2,It was terrible. Boring. No plot. Waste of time. The music was off. So many people said it was great and that it was underrated. I wouldn't give it more than 2 stars. Ugh.
" Not that much
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,3,I'm not expert in watching movies but It's a bad movie i rated 3 just for the new idea other than that i did not enjoy it at all
" Don't waste your time

" Horrendous
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,1,Sad to say this movie is the biggest disappointment. The selling clause seemed like it was going to be a good alternative sci-fi. Utter rubbish. Time I am never going to get back :(
" DEFINITELY worth the MONEY!
",2018-02-15 00:00:00,9,"It took me so long till I found a trailer that resonated with me. I did not know what to watch, spent so much time figuring what to spend my money on...being very picky. I am GLAD I watched this movie. Great acting. Great, very very great and relevant message. And a nice ending, not too corny! So, do not for a moment hesitate to spend some money and time on this money, it is definitely not a waste. One of the few treasures out there! Should have received more attention though in the media!"
" A movie about emotions
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,9,"I don't know why the film was not succesful, I think it's almost a masterpiece, as someone else in the reviews has already written.
It's a real talent to describe the human emotions, I was comparing this movie with ""Passengers"" an high budget film, with vfx, action, and a great plot, but so lack of emotions, so lack of love. In Passengers I don't believe the two protagonists love each other, I didn't felt nothing.
In this little indipendent movie I felt a lot, I falled in love with them. If you as a storyteller achieve this, you have done a good job, In many great budget american movie I don't feel emotions, just some entertainment. So thank you Drake Doremus, you made me feel something."
" Been there, done that.
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,5,"I was excited to watch this movie because I am a big fan of a good dystopian story. The beginning felt a little like ""1984"" or ""Anthem,"" which is a decent base, but the context was a little unclear. As the film went on, the plot left much to be desired. It wasn't horrible, but it never really departed from the ""Anthem"" theme- I have read or seen most of these ideas before. The characters didn't have great chemistry, so it was hard to really feel empathy. The romance just felt awkward and forced. The actors didn't do a bad job. In fact, they did quite well. The whole thing just wasn't a magic combination. To finish, there wasn't much resolution in the end. Not that every film has to have a happy ending or even closure, but if there is going to be an unresolved ending, the whole movie needs a certain solidity which this particular one lacked.So to sum it up: The film was based on a good idea and had good potential, but there wasn't really anything that made it stand out among the ever-growing dystopian genre. I don't regret watching it, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone else."
" Switched on Syndrome
",2017-11-11 00:00:00,4,"This is the latest in ""Brave New World"" inspired films. The scene is post ""Great War"" when 98% of the planet became uninhabitable. The world was divided into two. There was ""The Peninsula"" which we saw only in pictures. It was a world of regular people eking by. Our Brave New World society has developed without emotions and they are concerned with spending resources on space exploration rather than maybe help folks on the peninsula. A disease called Switched on Syndrome (SOS) happens when genes suddenly allow emotions. At this point you could write the script and perhaps do a better job.Kristen Stewart got selected to play a person that hides emotion in order to avoid the option of a ""pain free death scenario."" This was a boring film from start to finish. The characters had no character by design...and when they got SOS they strive not to show any character.Guide: No swearing or nudity. One ""coupling"" scene."
" A Futuristic Science Fiction Love Story with More Than Meets the Eyes (Although a Spectacular Treat for the Eyes)
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,8,"Love. The birth of love. This is what I see in this film and I think it is genius. ""Switched On Syndrome"" is what it is called in this futuristic society, when individuals not allowed to have any emotions, begin to feel. This disease then progresses in stages, stage 4 progressing to bring ""cancelled"", then being sent to The Den, after which individuals disappear forever. Many individuals, in order to avoid this, committee suicide. The title refers to the so called ""cure"", Ashby ENI, after which affected individuals reintegrate themselves into The Collective, the world of equals, those that do not feel. The performances in this film are underrated, especially Kristen Stewart. As her character says early on, it takes an incredible amount of practice and restrain in order to not let her emotions show (she is a ""hider"" in the otherwise emotionless utopia). The same goes for the actors and actresses. I feel critics underestimated what it actually takes. A straight face, no significant body language, stoic movements, a completely neutral tone of voice. The other formidable aspect of this film is the mise en scène: the sleek color scheme, the lighting, the muted profiles, the clever silhouette use, the switch from all white to the masterful technique of montages, stolen smiles, glances, tears, physical contact, music, colors. Critical reception was not great. I guess many of the critics did not like the mundane, the slow pace; the not completely believable, captivating, intelligent, or even logical universe. Well, that is why most individuals do not appreciate many of the international films that I do. I am not typically a science fiction fan, nor of the future assist Society apocalyptic film. For the reasons stated above, this one was an exception. **** Spoilers **** What I did hate was the ending. Nia and Silas are planning to escape to The Peninsula, somewhere untracked where they could love freely, but the day before they plan to leave, Nia is summoned, tested, and found to be pregnant. She is taken to The Den, eventually escapes with underground help, but finds Silas a little late. À la Shakespeare, he was told she died by asphyxiation, almost commits suicide, but instead decides to receive the cure. He no longer loves her, though he claims to remember what it felt like. He decides to leave with Nia anyways. In the train, he moves to hold her hand. Curtain. I am not a fan of happy endings, all things tied up with a pretty bow, but I am a fan of realistic endings that are sad because they need to be or should be. There is no reason for the depressing ending here, however. Director Drake Doremus redeems it slightly with the hand hold. Nia is still pregnant as far as we know. But not quite enough for me."
" I liked this film a lot
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,7,"This story has a very Gattaca or 1984 quality, where all forms of intimacy has been banned in a world where minds and lives are controlled. People are regulated from what they wear and do at work, to where they spend time and how they spend time with others. Of course, this is the setting for rebellion. Humanity will always come through."
" In a dystopian future two 'work-mate strangers' find an illegal way to feel in an emotionless society
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,10,"This science fiction classic mirrors 1984 in a future society where relationships are illegal. In both stories the reason why emotions are shunned is only vaguely explained, but, in both cases, one presumes this is because it is the only way resources can be effectively mobilized to ensure society survives. In both cases civilization has come back from the brink of disaster in a very different form. In 1984 people were inspired to work by patriotic newscasts of a gigantic war. In Equals people are inspired by the need of society to seek resources from outer space.Considerable thought has gone into this gem. The dialogue is sparing but brimming with heart. The leads are beautiful even in their pared back uniforms. There is just enough variety in the uniforms to imply a high degree of psychology. Touches such as amazing looking meals, the allowance of artistic impressions and puzzles for mass media, apparently lax computer access and brilliantly conceived, and beautiful, architecture and interior design, all lend probability and sincerity to the world and the story that emerges from it. Suicide exists and is accepted. Punishment and enforcement are vague. There is only token caution rather than stigma attached to major illness. This is rote kindness and visual perfection as horror.I've already given too much away. This is must-see viewing for science fiction fans."

" Brave New World meets Romeo and Juliet, with a little Eternal Sunshine for posterity
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,7,"Throughout my entire first watching of the film I was left with the impression that this movie takes place in the same universe as Equilibrium. Same plot line. Same history. So instead of feeling like this movie is a copycat, I went with the idea that it is just another story line from the same time-line. This makes it easier to watch. That being said, this movie is basically just a string of recognizable ideas. I would never describe it as original, or surprising. It seemed like the love child of many different well-known stories. The movie was brilliantly filmed, however. And the main actors did a fantastic job. It was fun to watch from beginning to end; compelling, interesting, and emotionally moving. It is worth a watch."
" Intensity of the commonplace
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,10,"Perhaps the most brilliant aspect of the film is how all of our understanding of emotions, how they work, what they do, the small interactions between them; everything is set aside. This creates a blank canvas on which director Drake Doremus paints the vivid hues we have become desensitised to. If you wish for a film that reignites your excitement for life, and it's chaotic harmony, Equals should do the trick."
" Overused premise, but it has something else going on below the surface
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,6,"This movie feels like a blend of Equilibrium and Gattaca, to me. Equilibrium, because this is a dystopian society where it's wrong to feel emotions, and the world and wardrobe have the feel of Gattaca. Not much happens in this movie, and the pacing is slow. I know this sounds bad, and it would have been if not for the stellar chemistry between Kristen Stewart (Nia) and Nicholas Hoult (Silas).This was the only redeeming aspect of the movie for me, and I think their chemistry may have been the entire point. By the end I was so vested in their relationship, I could feel the desire when they would look at each other and couldn't act on it, and feel their pain when they were apart.The thought of being an adult and never knowing love. It's hard to imagine, but they captured it, and when they began to experience these feelings and sneak off to be together, watching them slowly touch, kiss... I don't recall them speaking much, but it was so beautiful I couldn't look away. The camera angles were great, visualizing fingertips, heaving breaths, zoomed in tight, at all the right angles. While sexual in away, their interactions were still innocent, childlike. It tapped into memories of my first experiences as a teen with my high school sweetheart, and how thrilling it was at the time. There is an interesting twist at the end, and if the movie resonates with you the way it did me, you will totally get it, and it will both break and warm your heart. Six stars for being an overused premise, but if you are into this kind of movie it's well worth the watch."
" Boredom plus tedium 'equals' zero
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,5,"I am afraid this sci fi flic doesn't make it. It is long, tedious, and just not interesting enough. That is not the fault of the actors. The two leads, Nicholas Hoult and Kristen Stewart (one of my favourite actresses) are excellent. But they have a leaky vehicle, with an inept captain in the shape of director Drake Doremus. Also,the script is mediocre. Living in a bleak future where emotions and physical touching are banned, these two forbidden lovers live a furtive existence in their dystopian and antiseptic world, threatened on all sides by sneaks, monitors, and surveillance. The film could have been much shorter, had some pace instead of drifting along like a canoe on a calm river, and could have done with more incidents in the story. Better luck next time."
" A Promising Premise That Disappoints
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,4,"The premise of EQUALS is intriguing, depicting a society that suppresses all emotions -- with the aid of drugs, if need be. To begin this review on a positive note, EQUALS is visually stunning.The set design is very convincing, immersing the viewer in a futuristic world of high technology. We have been there before, of course, but in EQUALS the enforcement of governmental edicts is not so brutal and violent as in other such films (1984, THX-1138). Unfortunately, the lead characters are underplayed to a fault, with both Nicholas Hoult (Silas) and Kristen Stewart (Nia) so wooden on screen as to make the story quite boring and inconsequential. I found it rather difficult to invest much interest in what became of these two halfhearted revolutionaries. Secret liaisons in dystopian societies have been presented much better than in this film. One audio problem is that much of the dialogue is whispered, overwhelmed by loud music. And what about the ending? There is no danger of spoiling it for you, as the filmmakers have accomplished that themselves. You will be left...well...emotionless at the final fade, surely not what the writers (Drake Doremus and Nathan Parker) intended. Disappointing."
" I've already seen this movie
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,4,"Yep, I did! It's just it was split in several other movies.Did you see ""The Giver""? Then you saw 80% of ""Equals"". The rest is Equilibrium without fights, Aeon Flux, Divergent and any other recent dystopian and futuristic movie you saw in the last ten years. Same main plot: people who are prevent from birth to feel anything in order to keep them calm and productive. No love, no anger, no interaction of any kind between the members of this dystopian society except at work. Consequently, no joy, no sex, no violence, no anything. If you begin to feel, you are ""ill"" and gradually become a pariah. Eventually, you are eliminated.Life is the same as in The Giver, the scenography almost the same, the love story almost the same, with help from some ""rebels"", who will sacrifice themselves for him and her. And that's it... until the sequel, which probably will come, in already old fashioned Hollywood style.It seems like a movie made especially for Kristen Stewart. She takes his role seriously and gives some credibility to her character, Nia. The other leading character, Silas, is also played pretty convincing by Nicholas Hoult. The main problem is that they cannot convince us about almost anything because of the script, which brutally lacks of originality and substance. The entire movie is about waiting to happen something and when it finally happens, you knew already what is about and... finish!Too bad for wasting a talent like Guy Pearce for such a small and bland part.!!! Spoiler alert: The only scene with some emotional charge is the first ""encounter"" of Silas and Nia in the rest room. It's one of the most literally decent erotic scenes I've seen in years. For a moment, you feel like it's not about sex, it's just about the sensation of touching anybody else for the first time. It's an idea you can find in Isaac Asimov's excellent novel ""The Naked Sun"" and interestingly put in this movie. End of Spoiler.For that scene I'm rising my note, otherwise the movie it's quite poor in every aspect."
" Shortlist this film.
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,9,"""Equals"" goes on my short list of films so fine they grow better with time.I've watched this three times now since it's release almost two years ago, and it has actually been markedly better each time as I learned to see a world that is alien to my sensibilities. By the third time, the beautiful and subtle display and repression and growth of emotions for characters affected by the ""disease"" - and lack of them for others unaffected - was actually heart-wrenching. This subtlety and this film is otherwise not easy to grasp because subtle emotion is largely missing or invisible in our own time and art, so maybe that's why the critics and most of the public missed the show. But miss it they did, and that's not only their true loss but certainly a loss for all involved.I guess the cast and crew knew they were making an excellent film and rose to the occasion. High end performances all around - for which we must also credit the direction, design and production quality. Some have called this film a masterpiece. It may well be, but I'll come back to view it again in a few years before I try to make that call.Meanwhile, I can tell you it's at least nearly a masterpiece. Stewart knocks it out of the park. She and the film ought to have had a couple of major awards, and the competition that year was not weak. I've rarely seen a performance anywhere the equal, and if there is a film where performance matters it is ""Equals"" because it is about human emotion. Mr Nicholas Hoult also deserves a vigorous nod.I don't think it's technically a spoiler to mention there is no serious nudity in this film, but the lack of it may have been the spoiler at the box office and for the critics (IMHO). The audience needs a better foothold in this future world as the film opens. The contrast of our own sexual response to nudity and the lack of such response in this imagined future dystopia could have been that, helping clarify that we are seeing genetically repressed emotional response, as contrasted with culturally suppressed. If this were my film, I'd go back to the cutting room now and add nudity at the beginning. And since that missing foothold - however its accomplished - is key to grasping the rich subtext as the film begins and unwinds, I'm going to give it a 7/10 for my first round, which is a little better than the score awarded by critics and general audience, an 8/10 for my second watch, and 9/10 for my latest viewing.Thanks to all and encore!"
" A Suspenseful Must-See
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,7,"Equals is wonderful, a must see if you have any feelings at all. The movie is set in a futuristic, ""utopian"" world where emotion is taken away from humans at birth. Recently though, the SOS disease, which enables these emotions, has been striking and our two main protagonists are ""suffering"" from it which leads to a wonderful love story.The movie does a great job to create suspense. Without spoiling anything, the tension between our two main characters (played by Kristen Stewart and Nicholas Hoult) leading up to their first contact is perfect and I mustn't say that it delivers great satisfaction when it happens. The two actors are extraordinary, fast paced shots are on point and the story is believable and engaging.Do watch it for an emotional trip."
" I don't write reviews
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,9,"unless the movie is exceptional, and this movie is exceptional. Yes, the first part of the film is a bit of a slow motion ho-hum, but once the stage is set, this movie begins to tear your heart out to the point you are screaming RUN. I am still shaking and emotionally drained, but it reminded me of what life is all about.I'm not a good critic as to the acting, music score, production and all that, just how I felt during and after the movie and this one turned me inside out and made me so thankful that I found my true love, and I'm male. This is a real gem!"
" A cold but often impressivly unique Sci-Fi
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,5,"How do you create a bond and a connection with your audience to make them care when the very core needs of these elements are what your film deliberately doesn't have within its main characters? It's the problem Like Crazy and Breathe In director Drake Doremus faces with this, his next romantically tinged feature Equals and it's a problem that whilst is amiably worked on, is eventually one that can't quite be fixed with Doremus's visually arresting and intriguing in concept tale.Centred within a futuristic landscape where emotions have been nixed within humans to the point of being almost entirely defunct, Nicholas Hoult's illustrator Silas and Kristen Stewart's researcher Nia find themselves feeling the very emotions their organisation are unwillingly to let exist and problems from this obviously ensue.Doremus film feels like a distant cousin to a Sci-Fi films like Gattaca and over a short period of time the young filmmaker has showcased an impressive talent behind the camera with his romantically tinged dramas delivering enough to suggest that he could well become one of the most promising members of the new generation of filmmakers coming through the system but Equals feels like too much for him to pull off.It's a difficult ask for Doremus and his cast to pull Equals off, as having a film where emotions are largely held within makes it that much more difficult for the audience to invest ourselves in these persona's.In many ways Hoult and Stewart do a fine job in their respective roles and are well supported in very small ways by a supporting cast led by Australian's Guy Pearce and Jacki Weaver but in a narrative that is more focused solely on the developing feelings between Silas and Nia as they suffer through S.O.S (Switched On Syndrome), Doremus needed to broaden the horizon of this Sci-Fi universe with the possibility the film as a whole would've benefited greatly from a broader plateau of what has lead mankind to this point history, although budget restraints were clearly factors for this not taking place.Equals is a visually arresting film that feels close to being great in many ways, but is held back by numerous failings. Equals is Doremus's most disappointing film so far no doubt, yet it also harbors enough within in it to suggest that the director is still very much a talent to keep a close eye on as he progresses in his craft.2 ½ coffee mugs out of 5"

The music the effects the chemistry.Totally rocks.the plot as well.Everything was fictionally beautiful.Kristen and Nicholas make an awesome pair. Zombie and Vampire kinda stuff.I loved it and anyone who wants a break from Life can watch it
" Awesome soundtrack and production design

I don't know if everything has to have a reason why, as always the aim its done. The chemistry between the couple is so real I can feel it and I you don't like it, you should live in a world like the one in the movie."

It truly is a beautiful movie chocked full of slow touching moments accompanied by a touching, thought- provoking score. Give it 30 minutes and you will be hooked. Nicolas and Kristen, whom I normally give an ""ok"", deliver a beautiful performance."
" Dystopian New World falls apart due to love – type thing
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,5,"Set sometime in the 'yet to happen time', we meet some people who all dress boringly and seem to have no emotions, and these are not doctors receptionists by the way. Here we meet Silas who does a boring job and he starts to have feelings for a co – worker and worse still she has the same for him.In this society emotions are seen as the root of all evil (well greed is normally cited) and so people are screened for the 'disease' of feeling and if found to be infected they have to be cured or well you guessed what the alternative is.Now this is a film that a lot of styling has been put into it and the actors are all really good and it does manage to keep your attention. The problem is lack of originality – in that we have all seen films like this before where a couple lurve each other and want to do a runner to the 'badlands' or wherever the mutants dwell.So if you like a good rehash of a few films or stories then it is worth a punt otherwise there may not be a lot here to hold your interest – Guy Pearce is even in it and even that fact fails to raise this from its own self created, dystopian existence of self inflicted mediocrity."
" Wants to be more than it is.

A society where emotions are viewed as a disease and people actually do not question it throughout almost the entire movie made me curious enough to watch it.However, it got overpowered by a romance where I could not even feel the chemistry. Kirsten's face works well for the robotic layer of her character but when trying to convey emotion, let alone chemistry with her co-star, it just didn't work. Also, her excessive thinness and bags under her eyes truly annoyed me. Aren't these people supposed to look healthy because they are free of pretty much all diseases?Also, I have to admit, I dozed off from time to time. Granted, a restless night of sleep didn't help but boy was this movie slow. There wasn't even a climax, not really, no matter how high the director pumped the soundtrack's volume up.The first contact between those two should have been much more intense. Their reactions were pretty muted considering that supposedly they had never even touched anyone up to that point. Just holding hands should have sent sparks all over their bodies, being confined in such a small space and that close and all. Instead there was just a lot of eye, lips and hands close-ups and some panting but no actual emotion or passion that came across.The development after the plot twist made me bat-crazy. I could not understand why the guy was running around, it just seemed ridiculous.The ending was a major cliffhanger and did not satisfy me in the least.I wish I had seen more of the dystopia, the world building, than such a major focus on romance.It was okay but really, really slow and honestly not that interesting."
" An awful bland boring film.
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,2,"When I read the blurb for this film I thought it had the potential to be a really fun interesting film, but no this film is pretty awful. The premise of this film is set in the future where emotion has been totally eradicated, emotion is seen as a disease and when two people get it they try to avoid the rest of their community. Nicholas hoult plays the main character and he is okay in this film, for the first half of this film he is so stoic and boring that you don't care about his character. But as the film progresses his acting manages to get the best out his bland character. Kristen stewart plays the other part of this relationship and I thought she was alright in this film, similar to hoult she is pretty bland to begin with but she does grow a bit in the film and ends up giving an OK performance. Guy pearce plays another diseased character and I thought he was the most interesting character in this film but he isn't really explored enough. Unfortunately, I feel like this film could have done with an antagonist who was a person to add more excitement for this film. The story of this film isn't particularly interesting. Too much time is spent on their romance which I didn't really care about so it hurt the movie. The 3rd act picks up a little bit but ruins it with a poor ending that goes against the rest of the film. The script is really bland and grim with there being absolutely no humour in this film to speak of. The style of this film just looks grim, the drab colours of the scenery just doesn't entice you to want to watch this film. This film is really slow paced and I think would have worked better embracing it's sci fi elements more. Overall this is a pretty awful film that I think you should try to avoid."
" Awakening
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,10,"Great for awakening something new, inside you, dreaming of a new world, also for giving a thought to the small details in daily life.The atmosphere of the film is a little bit disturbing, overwhelming and breathtaking, the characters are well selected and the acting gives you the feeling that the actors always belonged to each other.I really wouldn't give so much attention to the rating of the movie, specially for this occasion, I definitely will give it a shot first.The film is situated in a modern world, everything seems to be really advanced, with refined architecture.Really beautiful."
" Interesting movie that makes you think-spoiler
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"It is a shame that to get a 10 you either have to have struggled at the hands of a real life oppressor or violence must occur. I prefer the real life oppressor movies myself because in Hollywood we all come out as winners. This movie requires a little more from the audience than either of those types of films. You are required to think, it is artsy and futuristic. The emotions are subtle but you can feel them in a society where there is NO emotion. The fact that the actors make you feel the emotions with such chemistry made the movie. The premise was good, it was an interesting concept and it was done well. I agree with another comment on here that the music might have been done a little better. But the ending left how it was..is part of the unknown. You needed to understand that to get this movie at all.I gave this an 8 because it was slow in parts and the music. But it was an adventurous type of movie, one showing and antiseptic life without feeling and how some characters chose to change it for themselves."
" Same (in)difference
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,5,"I think I have to watch Gattaca again. I remember having issues with that, but maybe the second time around and especially after watching this rather mediocre attempt/stab at a society that is not allowed to feel anything, I may look at it with a different perspective. Having said, it's not all bad here. It is by the numbers and it works for what it is I reckon, but that might not be enough for some.Having said that, the actors try their best to shine in this dystopian landscape which isn't that easy. Still predictable, even without some notions and inserts, this will not surprise too many viewers. It flows along nicely though and at least doesn't fail its goals"
" No, this is not Equalibrium . . . an entirely different experience
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,7,"Yes, of course, obviously, for the casual observer, Equilibrium comes to mind.But beyond that simplistic, surface veneer comparison, this is an entirely different experience. If anything, the minimalistic yet compellingly powerful treatment of this production and much of its core theme is more closely in sync with the classic film GATTACCA, somewhat intersecting with Code 46.No, there is no blazing CGI, militaristic action scenes, and other such glitzy eye candy features. If that sort of content is the desired ingredients for attraction, this production will seem ""slow"", and probably won't resonate with your usual requirements for entertainment.But that's not the point of this film, far from it.Many of the other reviewers here go into considerable detail on the aesthetic content of the production and plot particulars, so no need to repeat such again.I might offer, though, that Kristen Stewart was surprisingly on point as Nia. If anything, I might have been a bit skeptical going in with her as a lead character, but her performance was considerably more than expected.This is a film that will stick with you for some time to come, not because of blaring action scenes or uniquely original story concepts, but because of what it makes you feel, and perhaps give some thought and contemplation to.A very solid 7 out of 10 for me."
" Great premise but could have been so much better
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,4,"For a rating of 6 out of 10 I expected this to be better.Things I liked: Good concept, The characters, Kept me interested to see how things would turn outThings I didn't like: Very slow, Terrible endingI don't understand other reviewers who thought the ending was ""chilling"". I found the ending to be unsatisfying. To me it would have been better just to not have watched the movie since it ends so abruptly without finishing the story. The ending had a ""to be continued"" feel to it. Very disappointing.I would not recommend watching."
" For an old timer its just so much remake
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"If you've watched. Dot dot dot. The opening words, or at least words you see contained so frequently in reviews these days, is always so likely to be ones you'll see in reviews for Equals.Its hard to deny that Equals is a good film. The players of this film provide some wonderful performances, the cinematography is articulate and balanced, and the music score artfully weaves to provide a tapestry of distopian sci-fi romantic contemplation. Contemplation on a genetically modified world in which we have lost our ability to think (and feel) for ourselves.I was left wanting. Because while all the above are true, Equals lacked appropriate pacing the beautiful cinematography often lingered too long on faces whose owners were only just awakening to their new feelings with a twitch here, or a clenched fist their. It missed giving the viewer any reason to particular care about the characters. It failed to provide action or jeopardy.Ultimately the story is reminiscent to so many others, but with out the flair or excitement. I can only imagine that anyone rating this highly, has yet to delve in to other distopian classics such as Logons Run, Battle Royale or The Island, to name but a few."
