" Western Horror With Kurt Russell? Yes Please!
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,8,"While not a fan of westerns, I watched this movie specifically for Kurt Russell, and I was pleasanty surprised. The whole setting is very well done, although many times the movie is way too dark, and everything seems so ""clean"" for a western. The suspense is amazing and the troglodytes are a scary bunch. There's some gore which is really nasty and does serves a purpose, it's not there just to freak you out.If you like a different take on the western genre, I thoroughly recommend this. Character development is done really well, you end up knowing the group of cowboys and rooting for them, even for John Brooder, who's kinda messed up. And if you like good ol' Kurt, get ready for some kick ass scenes from the most underrated badass guy from the 80s and 90s. I loved some lines of dialog, too.Overall, another proof that low budget films (only 1.8m!) can be really good, and even better than high budget crap. 8/10"
" It's tense as the title insinuates.
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,8,"With ""S. Craig Zahler's"" Screenplay, the film knows how to propel its characters forward in an engaging way, while adding a surprising amount of heart, and dark humor."
" What's Not to Like?
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,9,"Good dialog. Good acting. Good scenery. A story that constantly moves forward...and those bad guys!So much better than, say, Tarantino's Hateful 8, despite having a similar feel.One star off for slight cliches, like people getting shot or hit by arrows, but continuing on. And, one character coming thru the whole ordeal virtually unscathed. Perhaps the only unrealistic part in the whole film.*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**"
" Horror Western Perfection
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,10,Everyone involved in this has given their absolute best. It is phenomenal.
" Excellent Western horror
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,9,"A very original, but equally strange film due to the director going for the duel genre, which isn't done often, but when done correctly, it works like a dream. This film is an excellent western in its own right, but absolutely brutal in its horror elements that due to its nature, will reflect why certain people might not appreciate it initially. It starts off very quickly and you kind of know the sort of brutality you are in for, but this isn't a horror film in the sense of slasher elements from start to finish. Instead it introduces the characters brilliantly and follows their quest to find the kidnapped wife of one of the men, who has been taken by a bunch of cannibals. We are slowly involved in their hunt for the caves where these kidnappers live, but on route as with every western, they meet characters and all sorts of obstacles which are stopping them from achieving their mission. It has a stellar cast with Kurt Russell leading the pack and he is in brilliant form as per usual. A brutal, but excellent horror western that is well worth the watch. Keep with it, be patient and be gobsmacked by the extremely violent climax."
" Lots of good stuff, slow burn with payoff, a few problems
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,"I appreciated the unglorified Old West portrayal, excellent storytelling, and fine acting.A few odd things that didn't make sense to me as far as direction:1. Considering the excellent period costuming for the men, and even for Sean Young's character, why the hell was Samantha's (Lili Simmons) hair and makeup straight out of 2015? This sort of thing is always so infuriating, hair and make-up is often not period so that stupid people will more easily identify with characters and this isn't a film that needs to make that appeal at all.2. I'm sick and tired of the portrayal of almost every single gun shot completely instantly killing someone. Anyone who's seen someone get shot knows that it almost never instantly kills someone (unless you're a black person confronted by a white policeman in the US). Even a gunshot to the head will precipitate seizures, twitching and involuntary movement. In a film like this which is meant to be disturbing and gory, this inaccuracy is very frustrating.3. The stone age cannibals' portrayal was quite good, however their 'loincloths' were obviously way too conveniently attached in a very unlikely way. It's another strange detail as the actors obviously weren't shy and the story certainly didn't predicate modesty.Still an excellent film."
" A good movie, great plot, but watching it once was more than enough
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,8,"This movie was suggested to me and because I like westerns (as well as have yet to see a Kurt Russell movie I haven't liked) so I decided to check it out. As a Western genre film it starts off good and like most western movies you have a slow buildup to the climax, and I knew what I was getting into with this movie (cannibalism) but I've watched Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs so knew that there was going to be some disturbing scenes in it.While I wouldn't call this a ""slasher film"" per se, it's closely related. Several scenes will cause you to cringe and a couple are pretty graphic in nature.Actual plot is good and original with a great cast of actors, most of whom you realize look familiar but can't place them (I have a Plex Server and I can cross reference movies by actors which caused me to say ""That's where I saw him at!""). I've read that this is a pretty low budget movie, but you wouldn't know it.I'm just going to say it. This movie is difficult to watch unless you have a strong stomach. If you like horror/slasher movies, you might find this good. If you like suspense, you will be glued to the screen, but be prepared to turn it off and walk away for a while (I did). If you like Westerns, then I'll tell you straight up, you'll most likely like this. I watched it, I'm glad I did, but I don't think I'll be watching this again like I do with several other western flicks that I have."
" Cleverly scripted and extremely enjoyable Western/horror movie.
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Excellent, and very unusual Western movie with some horror elements in the mix. The writing is great, bringing vividly-drawn, immensely-likeable characters, to life with considered, intelligent writing.
There is an undercurrent of almost-humorous wit which lightens the grimness, and not a single clich√© can be found throughout this story of heroism and hardship.
The performances are uniformly great.
There's nothing flashy on any level, and it works all the better for that.
I was impressed."
" A breath of fresh air
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,9,"A breath of fresh air amongst modern movies, which shows that great movies begin and end with great scripts and well chosen casting.The premise revolves around the kidnapping of 2 residents of a sleepy western town and a recently arrived drifter by a cave dwelling tribe. The towns sheriff and 3 other men embark on a long horseback journey to rescue the missing town folk.Westerns do tend to be very decisive amongst movie fans. The wider public accuse them of being boring and for good reason. They tend to follow the same themes and cliches leading toward very similar set pieces and endings. So despite that i implore you to give Bone Tomahawk a go, it feels different.There is a charm about this movie where whilst being set 1890s could have been at any time in a sleepy town in the middle of nowhere. It doesn't get caught up in too much of the time period, use annoying language or have long unrelatable conversations.Likewise this movie could have been made at any point in the past 70 years. It doesn't resort to modern special effects. What we have is a well crafted, shot and acted cinematic movie.What really seals the deal here though is the cast. It is as well chosen as i've seen in a while. Kurt Russell is fantastic as the well weathered but courageous sheriff but its Richard Jenkins that steals the show as the 'back up deputy' a bumbling older gent who provides well placed comic relief but is often the moral compass throughout the story.Highly recommended."
" Did I watch the same movie as everyone else?
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,1,"I normally never leave reviews on here, but after sitting through 90% of the movie, I was wondering what other people thought of it. To my surprise, all the top comments give it a very high rating and a lot of praises. Did I watch the same movie as everyone else? Because wow. What a waste of time. The pace is slow, the characters barely fleshed out (pardon the pun), and much of the action and so called ""horror"" is frankly laugh worthy. The only reason I finished it was because, after spending so long watching it, I wanted to know how it ended. It wasn't worth it."
" Just to slow in the build
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,5,I liked this movie. Eventually. The build up was way to slow. Loved Kurt Russel and the rest but it was 30 minutes to long.
" Don't waste your time
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,2,"Stupid, unnecessary and disgusting. Yes, one very shocking scene, why? If you wrote this, you should hand in all your writing materials asap and apologize to your family and whoever had to experience this."
" well done adults only
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,10,"This story's intensity builds through the entire length of the film. All the characters ring true, & what would seem outrageous if not handed well is instead inevitable. There are some gruesome scenes that the young &/or squeamish should avoid."
" The Hills Have Eyes meets Tombstone
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,9,"I don't really know how else to describe this other that the title.The movie is just interesting to watch. The filmmakers keep you in suspense for most of it, with about 65% of this movie being the main characters' journey.The basic premise is this:
There's an ancient tribe of native Americans who have become, as one character describes them, abominations. Like I said, think Hills Have Eyes. Their sacred land is disturbed at the beginning of the movie by two criminals. They kill one, the other escapes and shows up in a small western town. Kurt Russell plays a tough, no nonsense sheriff and he takes down the drifter with a bullet to the leg. The towns doctor - whose husband is played by the great and underrated Patrick Wilson - is among three people abducted by the abominations in the middle of the night, leaving Kurt Russell to round up a posse to go find them.I watched this with a friend who said the middle of the movie was too boring, but the fact is if you like westerns, you shouldn't feel bored by this at all, no more so than the journey sequences in True Grit or Hostiles. Back in the old west, moving a great distance took time and this shows it. Think back to I Am Legend. We don't need to see the ""zombies"" every waking moment to feel the tension of knowing that they're there.Once this movie gets going, it embraces its horror element and will be sure to satisfy you gore lovers. The final 30 minutes are truly excellent and the dialogue and acting throughout is top notch. This movie feels less of a horror movie set in the old west and more of a western movie with a horror story.Definitely recommend!"
" Solid, brutal, and possibly unique mash-up of traditional Western and traditional horror
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,7,"""Bone Tomahawk"" is a unique film as far as I'm aware, being a Western/Horror combo. You might think that this might make for an odd mix, and it does, but it works well as long as you can accept the somewhat languid pace associated with traditional Westerns, as opposed to the quicker pace that normally accompanies a horror flick.Neither the Western or the horror elements are original, but put together they make a new and different kind of stew. You need to accept the somewhat slow pace to enjoy this film (if enjoy is the right word). For me it was very effective at slowly building suspense all the way to the end, at which point you are truly confronted with some horrific scenes. Let's just say that there's tons of foreplay preceding the climax, at which point it might be too much for some people's stomachs. Due to these ending scenes this film seems to have adversely affected my sleep and still bothers me a day later when I think about it. Frankly, for those that stick it out, ""Bone Tomahawk"" might even be the last straw that flips a few viewers into becoming vegetarians. I just thought that this warning should be tossed out before you commit two hours of your time."
" A hidden gem in several genres
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,9,"While this film was released in 2015, I did not watch it until 2020, when I finally crossed it off of my Amazon Prime watchlist. By the end of the film, I found myself cursing that I hadn't watched it sooner and let it sit there all the time. With an attention-grabbing ending, the director makes it a point to not let you leave your seat until the end, with great performances by Kurt Russell (no stranger to a great western), Richard Jenkins (as his backup deputy), Matthew Fox (who makes it a point to utilize his performance like one utilizes bullets in a gun: a controlled rate that makes you yearning for the next shot from him), and Patrick Wilson, whose character arguably has the most to lose in the worst possible circumstances. At some point in the film, after an already interesting ride, the film's principal genre switches from western to horror, which makes the audience, like the main characters, hold on just long enough to try and see how it all ends.In short, this film is worth your time, and maybe you'll hopefully realize it sooner than later."
" Closest to realism in a Western film yet
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,9,"How refreshing it was to see a Western that comes close to an accurate depiction of the actual levels of depraved, barbaric brutality against white settlers that were committed by Indians on a routine basis. Although the film naturally took great pains to cast the most brutal acts as an anomaly and not representative of the norm, anyone who has studied American history at all and in particular the practices of the native tribes knows that the specific acts depicted in the most gory parts of the film were not only commonplace but rather mild when compared with what was actually done to each other as well as to the white settlers. The film makers should be commended for having the courage to make such an effort in the direction of realism in these politically-correct times and Kurt Russel in particular should be applauded for being a part of a film that will probably never be permitted to be made again. Excellent acting throughout, and the writers did the best that they could in these truth-averse times. Not for children, but a recommended film for those who have lost faith in modern filmmakers."
" Okay but sluggish middle section prevents it from being anything more than that
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,6,"The West, late 1800s. When a man is killed and three people kidnapped in a small frontier town, a small band sets off to rescue the abductees. The journey will be a hazardous one and, moreover, the abductors are tribe of primitive, savage cave-dwellers. The odds are stacked against the rescuers.A fairly novel film: a Western-horror film, of sorts. Fortunately, the 'horror' side isn't overdone, leaving the film with heaps of potential. Set-up is good and there's a good degree of engagement with the characters.However, the middle section is where all the potential and good scene-setting is wasted as it just ambles along, going on detours that add nothing and padding the movie. Things come together in the final act but even then there are moments where the film drifts and goes nowhere.The film could easily have been 30 minutes shorter and been the better for it."
" Terrible
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,3,Waste of 2 hours. Very slow. Acting was horrible and nothing believable.
" Excellent horror western
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,10,A creative original film. this director created his own sub genre with this film. Great performances by all actors involved. But Matthew Fox steals the show as the gentleman gun slinger so many great one liners and his character was interesting and bad ass. The story is great and takes you in a direction you never expect. if you like horror and western genres you will enjoy this film. Dont read any spoilers and dont read about the movie... I went into it not knowing anything about and it blew me away 10 out of 10
" Not bad
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,7,"Not bad at all, quite graphic at points..yay it's not a tit flick,
but ;( shock horror) contains some male skin"
" So-so mark for a So-so movie
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,5,"The idea of the movie is an plus for me. Setting is out in the wild west, character build up is good and the nasty guys are good. So 5 stars for that.
The movies tries to be clever with meaningful dialogue like a Tarantino or a Silence of the Lambs type movie, but failed miserably to the point where my eyes got very heavy. So minus 5 stars for that."
" Expected more
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,5,"Slow storyline, weird conversations between characters, makes no sense. Acting was oke, to little action overall."

" Slow-burn Indie Western with a quality cast builds to a potent climax
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,7,"In the 1890s, four men in the Southwest-a sheriff (Kurt Russell), his aged deputy (Richard Jenkins), a gunslinger (Matthew Fox) and a wounded cowboy foreman (Patrick Wilson)-set out to bring back captives kidnapped by a mysterious nameless tribe that lives several days ride away. Lili Simmons plays the cattleman's wife while David Arquette plays a trashy outlaw. Sid Haig has a small role in the opening.""Bone Tomahawk"" (2015) has a surprisingly good cast for an Indie Western that only cost $1.8 million and shot in 21 days. It was the first film written/directed by S. Craig Zahler and reveals a master filmmaker in that he was able to make a quality movie on such a low-budget. The film has the confidence to take its time with interesting characters and entertaining mundane dialogues, which is reminiscent of Tarantino. There are flashes of violence, but this is a slow-burn Western that builds to a rewarding climax.It's a unique Western that meshes the Tarantino-style with realistically mundane Westerns like ""The Homesman"" (2014) and horrific gritty Indies like ""Cry Blood, Apache"" (1970). It's superior to the latter two, especially ""Cry Blood,"" but it's not quite in the ballpark of Tarantino due to lack of funds. Yet it ain't far off either.The movie runs 2 hours, 12 minutes, and was shot at Paramount Ranch, Agoura, California.GRADE: B+/A-"
" A cult classic
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,9,"Westerns is the first film genre I was introduced to and the closest one to my heart. It all started with the tv-show Bonanza and it went from there to the films of John Wayne, the spaghetti westerns and finally to my favorite film Tombstone. For many decades the genre has been quite weak. But now and again there comes a long a gem or two that make me believe that the genre will always be alive and forever evolving.
When Bone Tomahawk came out, I was very skeptical. I thought that it would just be a violent gorefest. That was not the case.The films story is very straight forward. A woman and a young deputy sheriff have been kidnapped by cannibals. Four men, a sheriff, the woman's husband, a gunslinger and a confused old man take on the mission to find them.
I was so determined about believing this film would begin to be brutal in the first ten minutes. Instead it has a slow but satisfying pace. We get to learn the rugged old sheriff who is played by a lowkey and simply perfect Kurt Russell. The other three men in the party is played by Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox and Richard Jenkins. These three actors, who should get much more praise in general, are giving career-best performances. Their chemistry together with Kurt Russell is just magical.When the plot finally starts moving faster with more action and gore it does not disappoint. There is plenty of gore in the film which it is famous for. But it is mostly concentrated in one scene. I think that the use of gore is so effective here. They do not miss-use it all the time. That leads to a much more horrific experience when it eventually happens.Finally, I just want to say that if you are interested in new approaches to genre-films, this is a must-see. S. Craig Zahler gives us such a rich blend of horror, drama and western that you can not label this film with one genre. It Is just Bone Tomahawk, an instant cult classic in my humble opinion."
" Hidden gem, a must see
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie by accident, because the other horror movies on Netflix failed miserably. The whole 2 hours I was on the edge of my seat. Very well acted, directed, excellent camerawork. The story, al-dough, very simple, leads you to the struggle that a tiny group of cowboys have to endure to get to the evil Indian tribe. Truly a fascinating movie."
" Gritty western
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,This was a gritty western with a realistic look at the dangers that existed in the Wild West with a experienced cast. The characters are complex and the plot shows the determination of love and faith while exposing the horrors of life and death in the landscape of courage and sacrifice.
" The talkative old-timer deputy
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,6,"The talkative old-timer deputy is fun to listen to
Sheriff got shot and sacrified himself
The pregnant crippled and blind women were hard to look at
The Whistle in the throat was pretty interesting
The guy that was tore in half from the crotch was the gore scene at its peak during the entire movie
Expected it to be more paced and bloody than it is tho"
" One of the creepiest deaths in horror movies is not enough.
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,4,"I respect S. Craig Zahler for writing books and movies. I do that too. But this movie is TOO LONG ( 2h 12min length) and around the first hour and a half NOTHING HAPPENS but four guys tumbling in desert outdoors. Zahler should cut at least 45 mins. In my opinion he wrote and directed so well one of the nastiest and most violent deaths in cinema (Deputy Nick's) but the rest of the film is slow burn with simpleton characters played by renowned actors. Despite this movie is catalogued as Drama/Horror/Western, horror is 10% only. And that's the problem. Too many genres."
" Bloody Wild West
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,5,"The plot is not conceived, the heroes go to rescue their friends, kidnapped by the savages. However, I did not expect from the film some plot tricks. But what I really expected was that the story would be diluted with a couple of dashing cowboy jokes or some interesting events that dilute the movement of the heroes to the cherished goal. But I didn't see it. There were some attempts, such as gangsters Mexicans and stealing horses, but all this was presented so crumpled and inaudible, that did not leave a smooth account of any memories. The duration of the film is very long, and at some point I caught myself thinking that I was incredibly bored. The dynamics are simply zero. Well, let's say the creators of the film didn't set a goal to show us dashing shootings and fights - that's not the message, but in this case, I can't understand what justified such an impressive duration of the film.There are no special claims to the actors. What they were offered, they played. But the very images of the main characters were not impressed, they are cardboard and some fresh, inanimate. Deaths of heroes do not cause an emotional response any more than the deaths of bloodthirsty savages. The heroes are not empathized, and this is a serious omission."
" Horror Western
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,7,This movie is absolutely disturbing! This western faces a foe of cannibalistic people/creatures. The group is able to blend into the territory and surprise attack. The noise they make is frightening. Parts of the movie makes your stomach upset. Kurt Russell is a wonderful Sheriff and his old man deputy is hilarious. Good movie that blends western and horror genres together.
" Believable
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,8,This is a terrific movie with great dialogue and fine performances. Drawn out a little but gripping non the less I believe this to be a top rating movie on a slender budget
" Brainless stupid violence.
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,1,"Don't bother. This movie starts out so well but is nothing but pointless, brainless violence in the end."
" Don't waist your time
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,1,"It's a stupid movie with a weak story. The wild people just kill and rub a woman, the 4 guys wana save their life. Just a veryyyy weak story"
" Stereotypical and Sick
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,1,Not a western but it is west of any plot or taste. The high scores are shocking and very revealing of our society. If it had been made in the 50s one might understand... but it wasn't. I felt dirty after watching it.
" So slow...a missed opportunity
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,3,"This is not a bad movie in terms of script idea and plot. Its clearly made with a huge budget, fine actors, etc. The problem is it's boring. The first hour should have been condensed into 20 minutes. Needless scenes. Scenes that are way too long. Small build ups to nothing. Very little ""happens"" through out and it's tedious. The acting is good but they are tasked with lifeless dialogue. The last 40 minutes of this endless movie get a bit better but by that time I didn't care and was ready for it to be over. YMMV but as much as I love Kurt Russel this movie doesn't deserve the high ratings it is receiving. Like The Hateful Eight...needlessly slow and forgetful."
" Sheriff Kurt Russel v Cannibal Demons
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,8,"This is a very decent Western Horror movie. The first half of the film is a fairy textbook well made Western with a sheriff, his deputy, a gunslinger, and an injured man on a mission to rescue a woman who has been kidnapped by cannibal savages in the hills. The third act of the movie they meet the cannibals and all hell breaks loose. There are a few moments in the third act I think the script made some weak choices but overall the film is extremely well made. Well worth your time."
" I never want to see this again...
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,5,"Who doesn't enjoy a good cowboys and indians movie? Be warned, 'Bone Tomahawk' is not your average...The film takes its time before anything happens. It is slow paced, and there's a lot of dialogue - probably too much. I found the film overlong.The action starts when Troglodytes abduct the town's doctor, Samantha, as well as the deputy and a drifter. An unlikely rescue party then goes after them: an ageing Sheriff, an old and forgetful deputy, Samantha's husband - who has an injured leg - and a ""smart man"" (to use his own words). When things started going very wrong, I think I longed for those quieter moments.There's some incredibly gruesome scenes that can never be unseen. I certainly didn't expect this from an all-star cast Western. I never want to see this film again - not because it's a bad film. Oh no, on the contrary, it is so well made that it is just too realistic, and disturbing."
" Bone Tomahawk. (2015)
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,8,"Classic western with elements of the cannibal horror genre, with which S. Graig Zahler makes his film debut. Atmospherically densely staged, the film scores above all with its detailed character narrative
and a relentless finale, but slows itself down with some unnecessary dialogue sequences.8.0"
" A kind of funny, semi gory, horror/ thriller
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,7,"I liked the movie and it was pretty original for the horror genre. I say semi gory, because there was only a few gory parts, one I kinda cringed lol. The movie had some dry humor to it and of course the actors were all good in it. A lot of famous actors in one movie sometimes can make the movie seem like an acting competition, but this one was done ok most bigger actors had smaller parts, so it worked out. I recommend watching the movie, it kept me engaged and interested, that's how I usually rate a movie.."
" I love the style, but something is a bit off
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,7,"I wanted to give this movie a 7, but I'm gonna settle on a 6. This movie has amazing atmosphere, amazing characters, amazing buildup. But unfortunately, it's just a lot of build up for a very quick finale. I think it needed another draft of editing. Also, even though I am a fan of the practical effects, some of them are a bit obvious. I loved the movie, but I don't think I can recommend it to everyone."
" A bit disturbing
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,8,"There's a thing about this movie that shows the suffering and toughness needed by men who lived in this time. Some of these characters had the grit and brutality to deal with these superhuman enemies. Cool movie, different."
" Good not great
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,7,Got recommended this by a film critic that we have on BBC radio Wales who said that it was great.The film isn't great its good that appears to crank up the gears and makes you sit up from your seat towards the end but it's only for 10 mins and finishes with a wimper when it had the position in the story to do so much more.I have a feeling there is a lot that didn't make the final cut. The film is a journey to track kidnapped people similar to maybe the searchers but when they reach the destination it should of been the final third of the film rather than the very brief 20 mins we in fact get of the stories climax.
" Slicker than your average
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,9,"This film is really good. It has some of the driest humour you will ever find in a modern movie. It combines a horror film with a western perfectly. Dialogue is spot on and the director reminds me of Tarantino, but from alternative dimension.There are so many films that come out and you'll be hard pressed to watch all of them. But if you're an open minded film fan then you'll be glad that this is a film you didn't miss out on."
" Suspenseful horror fun
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,7,When the town doctor is kidnapped by a cannibalistic inbred tribe the local sheriff (Kurt Russell) puts together a 4 man posse to rescue her though unaware of the magnitude of the trouble ahead. The supporting cast of Josh Lucas and Matthew Fox are strong and the story is captivating to keep you hooked until the end.
" Western Horror or Horror Western
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,8,"I can't decide for myself to be perfectly honest.
Looking at reviews you either love it or hate it..much like your wifes family.
Personally i loved it...but i can't stand my wifes family so I'm no expert.Ok..the violence is graphic but it's not dwelled upon..it comes and goes as it does in real life...no build up or loud music.The real cowboy /alien crossover movie. Tried before with Cowboy V Aliens and that George Clooney one...this is much better.Go see it if you want ...I don't really care..I've got better things to do. Besides , i'm depressed as my wifes family have just arrived."
" Average horror / western flick
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,5,"The setting and the topics are brilliant, but the execution not that much. The story is really straight forward, has no plot twists. The bandits go to the burial site, they die. One of the escapes to the town, the Indians follow him. Ok, he desecrated the burial ground. Instead they not only just kill him, but kidnap a woman and a sheriff deputy. (Why? They really kidnap people and drag them trough a 4 days desert trip?) Whatever. Then the husband with the bad leg joines a search team. Which is hunted down one by one. Except the husband who has an injury. And at the end love certanly triumphs, they kill the bad Indians one by one.
No suprises, no real antagonist characters. The Indians are two dimensional, they are just dumb, cruel savage cannibals.So, the movie does not provide any suprises and most of the time I felt the blood and gore placed only as shocking value so they could tell: wow we have made an excellent western movie which is also a horror!
I really like Kurt Russel and Mathew Fox, but they fail to elevate this film into being a memorable movie."
" Unflinching, Brutal, and Inspiring
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,9,"I went into this movie blind, only going off the IMDb rating, which I trust completely. And I now see it was well worth it. The cast's acting is perfect. Exactly what you'd expect from a line up like this. Especially that of Richard Jenkins, who's character is one you both dismiss yet root for, thanks to his incredible talent.I won't spoil this movie for you, but I will tell you that if it's a gritty, unforgiving action/horror film you're after, look no further than this hidden Netflix gem."
" Surprisingly good!
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,8,"I just happened upon this film while scrolling through the endless list of Prime Videos and series and movies and decided to check it out. What an interesting movie! Pretty violent, close to gratuitously, but not over the top. It worked in the context of the movie. Great performances by Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson and especially Matthew Fox. I wish we'd seen more of David Arquette, who I hardly recognized, and the woman who played Patrick Wilson's wife. She was really intriguing. Need to check her out."
" Similar to biography but it's not

" Slow and disturbing, very weak storyline
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,1,"Hardly is there any story and hence attempted to be covered up by some gruesome and gory scenes towards the end. Had the potential to be a very slick horror flick , but ended up bring a slow paced thriller moving at snail's pace . Except for the acting , there was nothing in the movie , wasted 2 hours of my time ."
" What an amazing film!
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,10,"I should've I watched this movie sooner, I watched Zahler's Brawl in cell block 99 & Dragged Across concrete and I absolutely loved them. This kind of movie is the why watching movies is one of my favorite things in the world. The violence and horror is intense, it's absolutely disturbing. the characters are very interesting, the story is gripping, the pacing is excellent and of course the directing and cinematography is beautiful. Zahler has a unique way of making excellent, gripping and intense films, especially with the violence, it's very quick and shocking when you don't expect it, which I love. And the sound design is very real and very good. The shot composition is brilliant too. I also loved his other 2 films so much, and this one is his best one and surprisingly it was his first too. I cannot wait for what this director makes in the future. This is the type of movie that you sit all the way through with all kinds of emotions never feeling bored and waiting to see what happens, and in the end you sit there in awe. 10/10 a must watch."
" Tombstone meets Cannibal Holocaust
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,8,"A truly effective blend of old-school western and exploitation horror that never feels cheap or contrived. The script is very well-written (it's reminiscent of the Coen Brothers, at times) and is filled with witty and sometimes very funny dialogue, and the actors all bring their A-game. The film is deliberately paced. It spends a lot of time setting up the characters and allowing the audience to get to know them, before diving headfirst into a nightmarish and gruesome third act that's right out of a Ruggero Deodato film. Probably the best blend of genre I've seen since From Dusk Till Dawn. Highly recommended"
" One of the best movies I'll never watch again.

A horror western that is abosultely a rare gem."
" Terrible...slow stupid story

" Well-done, small-tale western action
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,8,"I'm re-watching this movie after having just finished it last night, and am amazed at how well the story fits together. The dialogue, cinematography, sound and scoring all are fantastic. The characters may be a bit stiff, but that fits the quiet western setting where language (I would imagine) probably is as thoughtfully constructed as are all other aspects of frontier life. At the same time, the acting (esp. Richard Jenkins) is great. If the second act drags a bit the third pays off. Keep in mind, you're watching a tale of cowboys tracking kidnapers, so expect a bit of grit."
" Not just bad... but REALLY bad!! This makes Toxic Avenger look like Gone wth the Wind!
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,3,"From Reel Tunez... The Radio Show All About the Movies: Wow... this was REALLY bad! First, the ""period stuff"" was NOT right. The floors were perfect, walls were perfect, candles were clearly bulbs... just everything about it painted a picture of a low-budget movie production that just couldn't look like it really WAS the old west in the late 1800's. The production value was crap all around and the lighting was pretty horrendous too! (Props to the sound folks.. that was good and foley work was very good)
Story was very weak and muddled along at a snails pace.. and script sucked!! The word choices the actors used sounded like it was just the first bad attempt at a script. Pretty incorrect vernacular for people of the ""wild west"" to use.
It scores points for grossness... and Kurt Russell is such a likeable actor that you really WANT to like this movie. I went into it expecting a fair movie (so hopes weren't high), but it was wayyyy less than what I could have hoped for! How in the sam-hill did this thing get a 7+ on the imdb ratings??? NOOOOO WAYYY!!
Sorry... on a 1 to 10 scale.. this thing is a STINKER with a 3 star rating."
" Unusual but great western
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,8,"I've been researching and watching westerns lately because of the specifics of the genre and I have to recommend this film. With one small remark, but about it a little later.
Given that this is the director's debut, the film deserves all the praise. Not much was even invested in this film so it remained somehow unknown.
The scenery is beautiful and truly true to the genre, the characters (the cast is great) deep enough dramatically and interestingly, and the plot is western simple, the characters go from point A to point B to save the maiden from trouble.
Then why a recommendation other than being a newer western? We come to the remark, and that is that this is also a horror, given that the said maiden was not kidnapped by some infamous gang but by a cannibalistic tribe. That's why I can understand people who won't like this film because it combines two seemingly incompatible genres, this is not a film for everyone. You just have to be a fan of both genres, western and horror. However, I can't find a big flaw in the film and it has very good praise from me."
" The invention of ""The horror western""
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,10,"Dear Mr. Zahler,
You could have settled for the ultraviolence, the western setting of the action, the mistery around the villan and you would have gotten a decently entertaining movie for the audiences... But, nooo, you had to write excellent dialogue and get the best of your actors, you had to make every frame count and turn a horror-western hybrid into an actual FILM.... What where you thinking, mr. Zahler...?
I don't realy know what was your way of thinking when creating this instant classic, but i can't wait for your next invention!10 stars for exceeding my expectations and for the unusual blend of genres"
" Let's Pretend This Could Have Been a Parody
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,2,"Just as playing the piano is not pressing your fingers on the keys, making cinema is not about filming people do things, no matter the budget.
OK, ALERT! NO spoilers needed really, this was just terrible. If you came thinking this would be an awesome (or at least good) western w Kurt Russel then you are as wrong as if you thought visiting Auschwitz in 2020 would be like visiting an amusement park. A far cry, really. Sadly, it took me an hour to realize I was watching the wrong movie.
It is sad to realize, retrospectively of course, that the producer could have told the writer to redo the script into a parody like TROPIC THUNDER (2008). Because it is the type of story that is parodied in Tropic Thunder, or maybe even worse: here we have disenfranchised characters no one really cares about, dull dialogue, boring scenes, lack of common sense, and mindless fake gore.
But the mysteries of the cinema industry managed to produce this as it came.
One way to redeem this is to leave it to film cannibals that can edit it, add a funny commentary, and rehash it into a ten minutes comedy."
" Utter Garbage
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,2,"This had all the ingredients for a half decent movie. After an 1 1/2 HOURS of nothing happening it goes from 0 to 100...

" Gruesomely brilliant
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,8,I found this a really engaging mix of genres only let down by a glaring plot device setting up the final act. That aside I was completely drawn in and the two odd hours flew by without any fidgeting and no checking of the phone.The visuals; visceral and the dialogue a joy to hear.
" Awesome movie, not to be missed
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,9,"I'm not a fan of westerns as a rule, but I heard good things about this and decided to give it a try. Very awesome movie. Definitely intense and not for faint of heart. Characters are well-developed and Kurt Russell gives a great performance. The setting is authentic and doesn't come off as pretentious or forced. The pacing is right on and cinematography.No need to hash out the story here in my review as I don't think I would do it justice. This movie ddid stay with me for a while. I recommend as part of my list of must-watch movies to friends and family."
" ""Say goodbye to my wife. I'll say hello to yours.""
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,9,"""Bone Tomahawk"" is an absolutely savage horror/western hybrid that superbly juxtaposes the classic western with the goriest and nastiest horror. It's beautifully shot by debut director S. Craig Zahler. He captures the gorgeous cinematography that makes the traditional western and is uncompromising with the violence. It is unforgettable and some scenes will stay with you for a long time after. One scene in particular stands out to me as being one of the most gruesome and disturbing I've ever seen in a film. But the violence is not gratuitous, in spite of what some might claim. The violence is warranted, not only because Zahler is crossing a western with a horror, but also because in being so violent and gruesome the film authentically depicts the hardships and nastiness of frontier life at the end of the nineteenth century in the US.The cast are amazing, and the film is a slow-burner which allows us to get to know the characters very well. This also helps in creating the suspense as the characters travel across a barren frontier in search of their people who have been abducted by a ruthless indigenous tribe. In a film that has cult status written all over it, Kurt Russell does it yet again. In the tradition of his career high-points, Russell establishes himself as a memorable Western figure in his performance as Sheriff Hunt. The rambling but entertaining 'back-up deputy' Chicory is brilliantly played by Richard Jenkins. Possibly the best performance in the film, which is hard to pick, comes from Matthew Fox as John Brooder, a vain, cool-as-ice quick-shooter who claims to have killed more Indians than everyone else in the small frontier town of Bright Hope put together. Patrick Wilson and Lili Simmons are also very strong in their roles. ""Bone Tomahawk"" is now one of my all-time favourites. It is not only my favourite Western, but also one of the best horror films I've seen. The savage tribe are absolutely terrifying and uncompromisingly brutal. The make-up is amazing, the cinematography very effective. At the core of this film is a very modest attitude that only accentuates its greatness. To sum it up, ""Bone Tomahawk"" in juxtaposing two genres is the perfect Western and also a terrifying and gruesome horror that pulls no punches."
" Tough one - had good elements and really bad ones
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,5,"This is a tough one. The good elements:
Dialogue was pretty good, there were many quotable lines and many were pretty funny in that they were over the top.Cast was good, it was pretty well acted tooEffective over the top tribute to the Western and Horror genresThe bad:
It started good, but it got REALLY Tedious and long as it wentIn many places, it was just Way Too over the top and ridiculous"
" Different take on the genre
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,6,"Westerns are my fav genre. I was intrigued to see this film, especially as it had a such a relatively high rating on IMDb.The gruesome scenes are indeed gruesome but I was expecting more gore - though I'm not a huge fan of gore - so it was a relief. But then I wondered if the film's high rating relies on it. If the gore was removed, would the film suffer? I think so. I think the gore pushes the film beyond your stock standard western movie. This is both good and bad. Remove the gruesome scenes and perhaps it's less of a movie.Performances are solid. Particularly from Richard Jenkins (who does his awkward, nervy shtick, which I like) and Matthew Fox. For a low budget film it looks good. Script is good with some great lines: 'For a man named Buddy you're not very friendly' (something like that).Certainly worth a watch, especially for lovers of westerns."

",2020-04-30 00:00:00,1,"The work of the actors and a good dialogue are completely destroyed by ruthless and graphic violence. On top of everything, the storyline ought to have taken place in Papua New Guinea, so they've got the continent completely wrong. Prepare for a rude awakening."

The main four actors really played their parts very well. Also a lot of other reviewers on imbd said what a fantastic film it was. So I say a throughly good action and a fair amount of horror thrown in, made this film excellent, at a run time of two hours kept me entertained from start to finish. Jacey says go watch it."

" Gritty Brutal Atypical Western
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,9,"Wilson and Russell were superb. The character logic and dialog was not the norm for most westerns. The ""Indians"" aren't what you'd expect either. Neither is the rescue operation. In fact, for the most part, this was a very atypical western. One of the most brutal I have ever seen - but exceptionally well done.Not for kids.
Probably not for most women.I only give it a '9' because there ""ain't no 10s""."
" A lot gorier than I expected
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,7,"I heard about his film from someone and decided to watch it without any prior knowledge of the plot.
I was honestly impressed by how realistic the violence was. Props to the makeup and visual effects department.
I love how this movie is a genre clash; it's not listed as a horror but in a way there were a lot of horror elements incorporated. At first I was like, ""oh this looks like it's going to be a western/crime-thriller"", then BAM, it goes full SAW.
I honestly didn't realize Brooder was played by Matthew Fox until the end credit. And was this Kurt Russell's first ""horror"" movie since The Thing?
In summary, I enjoyed the film from start to finish and was recommended other works from the director. Rest assure I will be looking into more of his films."
" A gruesomely violent and extremely well written western horror
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,8,"A few residents of the town of Bright Hope are abducted by a group of mysterious, cannibalistic cave dwellers. The Sheriff Hunt (Kurt Russell), his right hand man Chicory (Richard Jenkins) and a group of individuals with connections to those kidnapped go on a 5 day journey to the caves to save them. It's a purposefully slow paced film in the best way possible; it has full respect and time for its characters, ensuring you can get to know them as much as possible in the time given. It's through the carefully written script and great performances that the story is given such rich depth to it that you care about what happens to everyone, making the impending horror all the more disturbing. Russell is great as always as the Sheriff and Jenkins, a seriously underrated actor, is brilliant! Patrick Wilson gives his best performance to date as Arthur, whose wife is abducted and he goes on the most difficult journey of rescue as he suffers from a decaying leg. It's the impressive directorial debut of writer/director S. Craig Zahler (Brawl In Cell Block 99) who also co-scored the film; the mood and the atmosphere is so thick you could cut through it! A brilliantly gruelling, engaging and character-driven Western with nasty horror edges"
" Great western flick
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,7,Good movie and let me warn you when you get caught by cannibals in this movie they are relentless and really don't hold the punches!It's a very slow burn right up until the last 3rd of the movie and then it gets good and it's all been worth the slow wait.Very realistic and authentic looking. Would recommend if your a huge western fan give this a clear 8/10 for you.Thanks MM.
" The clue is in the movie cover
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,1,"If the main character on the movie cover is looking at the ground, then that's a clue to how it'll be. - Grateful gods v Vengeful gods.No character content. No real story. No art. Just looking sad and bickering while playing-down acting like god. Snicker at anyone who looks weird.The total opposite of a movie."
" Omg Great
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,8,Omg this movie caught me off guard. It's great and definitely would recommend. There was a disturbing murder in this movie so viewer beware.

Despite being a bit of a slow burner, Bone Tomahawk keeps you on the edge of you seat, especially once you get a look a the grotesque cannibalistic natives. You wont leave your seat."
" Must watch for horror fans, great watch for (most) anyone else
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,8,"My friend once sent me a link of this movie, I'm sure it was pirated or something, and I wasn't too interested in even watching it.But it just drew me in, I'm a sucker for gritty western stuff so it wasn't hard to catch my eye. It picks up pace and becomes so brutal, and oddly intimate. It's one of those stories where it's got wonderfully acted characters, who you don't even need to love, that get you rooting for them because you can see why they do what they do. And it all just falls into place to deliver an unruly, painful, and disgusting narrative. If you like freaky stuff, and fantastic horror, it's really hard to find a reason to say this isn't worth a watch.Even if you're not largely into horror, as long as gore doesn't spook you, it's still 100% worth the watch."
" Don't like it
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,5,I'm a fan of good western movies but this mix between a good western and bad horror movie is just worth a five star rating for me.
" Bone Tomahawk
",2020-03-11 00:00:00,6,"If you want bone crunching visceral violence, Bone Tomahawk is for you.The early scenes set its stall out as one robber is cutting the throat of a man he is robbing. The casting of Sid Haig will inform you that this is a grindhouse western.In a small frontier town. A wounded criminal has been arrested for desecrating an Indian burial ground. A cannibalistic clan of troglodytes descend on the town and take him as well as the female doctor who was treating him.The Sheriff (Kurt Russell) his grizzled deputy (Richard Jenkins), the doctor's injured husband (Patrick Wilson) and a seasoned Indian killer (Matthew Fox) form a rescue posse.After the opening scenes, the pace slows to a more slow burn western, some of the dialogue comes close to being banal. Fox used to fancy Wilson's wife which puts them at loggerheads.Once they approach the clan's hideout, it becomes less of a western and more of a horror show as the movie switches genre. Some of the characters have a very high pain threshold."
" A different twist on a Western.

Synopsis: A scumbag bad guy desecrates the sacred ground of a pagan cannibalistic tribe of indian cave dwellers and the indians (who, though portrayed as indians, look like white men) go out for revenge. They take hostages to eat as food from the town of Bright Hope, including the attractive (of course) wife of the star, and the rescue is on... The posse includes: Kurt Russell does a great job in his usual role as a hard charging tough good-guy; one member was disliked for being the smartest and most capable (most capable leaders are often dislike by lesser men out of jealously); and the star, who goes on the posse with a compound fracture of his right leg (Yeah, like this would really happen!). The star slows down the rescue, and when they finally leave him behind he preservers alone to save the day, even though he is inept in most regards, observation, tactical security, and alertness... This movie puts a really hard role on women in the tribe... A totally new twist on barefoot, pregnant, in the kitchen..."
" Slow, plodding and features one of the most nauseating scenes I've witnessed
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,5,"Having heard so many good things about this film and, wanting to watch something unique, I finally gave this a watch. I am actually sorry I did, mainly due to one scene - the infamous ""splitting"" scene, which I won't spoil, but will warn that, if you are in any way ""sensitive"" to gore, you REALLY need to avoid this scene. I've watched many great and/or gory horror films over the years (and I love a good twisted horror film), so I am hardly one to become repulsed easily. The scene in question nearly made me vomit on the spot and I can't get it out of my head. It was entirely unnecessary and obviously included only for the shock value. Even the most exploitative films and scenes need to exhibit a purpose beyond going for straight-up shock value and the execution of this scene failed miserably in that regard.That is all I will say about that.Regarding the overall film quality, I felt that it was poorly paced, though not nearly as ""slow"" as others have described. For the first 20-30 minutes, the film does plod along while unnecessarily dragging out certain scenes, but it levels off well enough for the remainder of the film. Still, the early poor pacing is noticeable enough so as to detract from the scenes in question. Many have criticized the run time, but I had no issue with it, the first 20-30 minutes notwithstanding.In terms of performances, Kurt Russell and Richard Jenkins were the obvious standouts, so much so that they prevented the film from constituting an absolute bust.Again, if you have a weak stomach, you will either need to avoid this film altogether or go to another room when the infamous scene occurs."
" Peculiar in so many ways
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,7,You don't see many films like this one where the attention to characters personalities and their often inane dialogue Manages to keep you interested in the very slow plot. I would describe it as a kind of mix between the descent and Dawn til Dusk the cannibals themselves put me in mind of the troglodytes in the 1960 version of the Time Machine. It's over long at two hours but the reason for this is to get to know all of the protagonists Gory in parts and somewhat baffling in others.
" Good movie, great cast, and a rare gem!

" Original comedy
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,10,"Those who rated this movie poorly missed the fact that it's a comedy first and foremost. It's all in the dialogs delivered by seasoned actors. There are so many messages here. Like who's really civilized and who's not. In a scene, talking about a stolen horse: ""My Saucy (horse) would never let a greaser on her back"" ""Did you train her in bigotry?"" The movie is full of subtle things like that given to you with humor."
" Odd Mixture
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,5,"I just wasn't into this movie. I can't give a specific reason, but I found it a chore to sit through. Its a western where a woman gets abducted by some kind of native tribe and the characters that go to rescue her. I can't really say that there were any moments that stuck out for me--I've already forgotten a lot of the details. I went on to see Brawl in Cell Block 99 and Dragged Across Concrete, both of which I liked better, but didn't love. I might just not be the audience for this director."
" Distressingly effective
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,7,"I have such mixed feelings for this film. On the one hand, it masterfully gets to me, and on the other hand I kind of wish I could un-see it. I came in to this completely cold. I knew it was a different, edgy and pretty violent Western. And it starts off just so, and keeps going that direction for most of the movie. But then it catches you completely off guard and totally messes you up. That scene which I have now learned is infamous really stuck to my mind, to the extent that for several days since I saw the movie it still really bothers me and makes me feel truly unnerved. I have probably even lost sleep because of it. And that's coming from someone who usually isn't very affected by gruesome horror (I've also seen some of the cannibal movies that this is sometimes compared to). This tops them all in terms of emotional impact (the emotion being shock and disgust).What makes the movie so effective in its mission to draw you in is that it's very well acted, with great characters that you grow to care for throughout the movie. As the horrific stuff really gets going (and good lord, it's horrific), the performances, the sound design and the unflinching camera really sells it. It feels totally real and utterly nihilistic. So if the goal of the movie is to scar its audience, then it passes with flying colors.And still, if you close your eyes (and ears) during those scenes you still get a very enjoyable and solid Western movie with great script and production with some great performances by good actors."

",2020-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Bone Tomahawk is a slow burn western with true grit and realism, it isn't per se an action film as there are long dialogue scenes with character development but when the violence happens boy does it happens.Perhaps the most brutal violence I've seen on film, was on the edge of my seat at times, the director does not pull punches here, for those of a sensitive nature be warned.
Acting and dialogue is slow, deliberate and very good, characters clearly defined and realistic. If you're looking for a modern western with depth, violence and intensity Bone Tomahawk is for you."
" Wow! Disciplined, brutal, and fantastique!
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,9,"What a film debut from S. Craig Zahler! I'd been meaning to check out his work for a few years but finally got to it this week while home sick with the flu. I started with Brawl In Cell Block 99 which was a far superior film to what I expected, and Bone Tomahawk is even better!The ONLY movie I can even compare this to is a 1999 film I am EXTREMELY fond of and that is Ravenous (which also features my favorite film score of all time). Both are hybrid films that combine cannibalism-related horror elements with those of a western period piece. It's kind of wild how both open with a scene featuring David Arquette as well - makes me wonder if Zahler is a Ravenous fan as well and cast Arquette as a nod to it. The primary difference between these two is that Ravenous is the quicker-paced, campier B-movie version, while Bone Tomahawk plays more like a slow-burning, Oscar-nom type of film...that is, until the last half hour!I'd always heard this movie was brutal and the people who told me were not wrong. In fact, one specific act of violence has to be the most disturbing one I have seen in quite some time, especially considering it looks and sounds so realistic. If graphic death makes you squeamish, you may want to close your eyes through a lot of this movie, or just skip it entirely, but you'll be missing out on a fantastic movie.Leads Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson deliver their usual cadence and vibes but both fit the characters perfectly and carry the movie very well. It's supporting actor Richard Jenkins who truly shines the most though - putting him on the map as an A-grade actor. Matthew Fox was also brilliant! And, the writing is just phenomenal! Tension between characters is realistic and balanced, and there's just the right amount of dry humor that's surprisingly witty and relevant every time it's used.The movie is quite a bit slower than Cell Block 99 but it's well worth the build-up as you reach the vicious final act. I think the only downfall is that the tribesmen who are seemingly invincible throughout most of the movie seem a LITTLE too easy to ""manage"" in the later segments... but that's enough of a flaw to really taint this A-grade directorial debut. You can call me an S. Craig Zahler fan now."
" I'm going to throw this western movie a bone! It deserves more praise. The motion picture was an entertaining watch.
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,7,"There is no doubt that the filmmakers like director S. Craig Zahler & his crew really did work their fingers to the bone when making this movie about a Wild West Sherriff Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell) leading a posse into the desolate desert mountains to rescue two townspeople from a cannibalistic murderous cave dwelling tribe. It was executed quite well with very few mistakes. Pretty impressive for somebody first movie being filmed over 21 days in a very limited few locations with only using the 1st drafted of his script. While some critics might say that the film moves in a very slow paced with very limited action with certain kills happening off screen. I'm kinda glad that the film did it that way. It build up the suspense and wasn't too in your face. Nor was the action over the top. The violence is realistic quick & grotesque whenever it does happen onscreen. While you don't really get a good glimpse of what is happening sometimes. I like that nearly no forced music being played over it. It allow the sounds of the unknown haunted you to build tension. The majority of what you hear is the sound effect of people being hacked apart. It's really disturbing. Only one scene is fairly detail with a person getting his head scalp, genitals getting mutilated and then ripped apart by troglodytes. Warning! That infamous graphic NSFW moment in the cave is not for the faint of heart. It's emotionally scarring. Just wish the movie gave that character a little more of a backstory. He felt like a stock disposable redshirt. Regardless the sound design was still amazing. Not only that, but the cinematography was just as good. The way the background are frame with everybody around in wide shots was something worth seeing. There is no better example of that than all three men riding off into the desert. One thing I kinda wish the movie was a little bit better on was the plot. While the fictional story had very few factual historical errors, it was still kinda generic. Partly inspired by the works of author H. Rider Haggard. The basic concept felt honestly nothing new. Just see 1956 John Wayne's masterpiece 'The Searchers' and you got yourself a very similar premise just updated and more political correctly when depicting Native Americans and little more progressive with women. Plus the plot could had been a little more flushed out on how the kidnapping occurred. It seem far-fetched for a tribe not use to going beyond their caves to break out a season criminal out of jail in a town day 3 miles away without horses in the burning desert. I felt that the movie could had cut all the scenes involving the drifters and just focus on a wagon of town people gone missing or a homestead being built too close to their cave. It would had save the moment a lot of screen time. Have it similar to the opening of 2008 Western horror movie 'The Burrowers'. Regardless one thing the movie does right is the dialogue. I really enjoyed the witty conversations and the vibe between the characters. The quotes felt genuine and authentic to the time period. To add onto that, all the actors in this film did a hell of a job with their roles. Patrick Wilson as Arthur O'Dwyer was amazing. The pain that he goes throughout the film, you can honestly feel. Kurt Russell was a badass even if the character seem a bit Wyatt Earp Tombstone-ish with commanding delivery. Nevertheless the two actors that really brought their A Game has to be Matthew Fox as well-spoken pompous gunman John Brooder & Richard Jenkins as good hearted broken down assistant deputy named Chicory. The back and forth bicker fighting between their characters was very entertaining especially who is smarter. I can see this movie being study over in the years to come. In the end, all four of the main individuals in this film could be seem as interpretation of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse with each of them holding a similar trait bringing the end of primordial savagery within the Wild West. Overall: Make no bones about it. This visceral movie was nearly a masterpiece. So don't be a bone head. Go see this western! It's worth the watch."
" Surprisingly disturbing
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,10,"This movie will stick in your head long after you watch it. It's very well detailed and makes you wonder if stuff like this really happened back then. There's a scene near the end that's one of the most gruesome scenes I've ever witnessed in a film, period! You get to know the characters pretty well and you can't stop rooting for them once the story gets going. Attention to detail is well noticed in this movie also as far as the time period goes. Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors and he's probably the only one that could've pulled this role off in my opinion. The rest of the cast is not as famous as Kurt but they flow well together. I am glad I saw this movie because it makes me appreciate the life I have and just how precious life is. You will not be disappointed seeing this film."
" You have died of Boredom
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,2,"This movie was long, boring and a trudge to get through... you almost felt like you were the one dragging yourself through the desert on a broken leg, and you didn't have any tincture of opium to help with the pain.they had a good cast, they reproduced the era well... and at the end, you are nearly a hour and fifteen into the movie before they confront the cannibals, which turned into an anti-climatic mess."
" Not his best work
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,6,It is just a bland copy of Searchers with some cannibal stuff. It has very gruesome violence and very explicit. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who can't stand this type of film. Kurt Russell was good but overall the movie left me emotionless. It has good visuals at least. I loved Dragged Across Concrete more and I hope Brawl in Cell Block 99 will be more like Dragged Across Concrete and not like Bone Tomahawk.
" Well worth the journey
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,8,I watched the movie because I always have enjoy Matthew Fox's acting. The movie is an interesting take (story) on the western genre once it gets going it will keep you interest as to what will happen next. With a great cast and story elements.
" A Western-Horror Masterpiece (Huh?)
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,10,"I had passed over this film multiple times on Amazon's Prime not thinking once or twice about it, until one day (on the high I still had from watching Tarantino's The Hateful Eight) I decided to give it a try, mainly to see Kurt Russell and his impressive walrus-stache woo me over again. Holy Moly, was I totally unprepared for what a i was about to see. Many folks have already given this film thorough and well-written ratings but I can't help but add my two cents.I am a HUGE fan of the Western and only lately have a grown more fond of horror, and to see these genres mashed up in a two-hour vehicle driven by one of my favorite casts in years, is must see cinema. The film by title and cover seems as if it should be straight to video material but is in fact high quality, edge-of-your-seat acting, writing and production.The premise is a group of men try to save a man's wife from a mysterious tribe of cannibals.Kurt Russell (with his incredible stache), Patrick Wilson, and Richard Jenkins are perfectly cast in the roles as the posse that comes together to save Wilson's wife from the cannibals. Matthew Fox is the actor I never knew I wanted in a western, and oh lawdy, does he need to do more! He taps into Val Kilmer's spirit of Doc Holiday from 1993's ""Tombstone"", rounding out the posse.The film never feels long while we are given moments of pure horror while wondering what the hell these mysterious cave-dwellers are all about. I can still here their sounds now!This is an amazing directorial debut from S. Craig Zahler. Who I hope returns down this road later in his career. 10/10"
" Powerful and gritty horror/western movie
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,10,"Bone Tomahawk is powerful. The last half hour must be one of the most violent I have ever seen on screen. It's shockingly brutal. The film belongs to the Weird West genre, a mix of western and horror. The last Weird West flicks I saw were the disappointing The Hateful Eight and the pretty cool Ravenous. My favorite in the genre is Se sei vivo spara by Giulio Questi. S. Craig Zahler is a newcomer, but he wrote several screenplays before directing his first picture. He has written The Incident by Alexandre Court√®s. Bone Tomahawk is kind of slow, but never boring. I loved the scenery, the dialogues and the nice characters of the film. It has such a remarkable cast, Kurt Russel is far better in this than in The Hateful Eight, he plays the rightful strong silent cowboy. And I adored Richard Jenkins' character, I didn't recognized him right away. Bone Tomahawk has a creepy, but cool soundtrack that the director scored himself being also a musician. But for me, the biggest quality of the film is the cannibals. I enjoyed that we don't see them for almost the entire film, it creates expectations and suspense. They talk about them, they are a menace, but we don't see them for the most part, a little like Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now or the Cajuns in Southern Comfort. When you finally see them, they look so damn scary. They are cruel and soulless creatures. The design of their body is also very interesting. Anyway, it's truly one of the best horror I've seen this year."
" bone tomahawk
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,8,"Bone tomahawk and hateful eight come at at some year and between these two i would rather watch hateful eight,still this is solid western with good cast and kurt russel thats stands up above the rest"
" Boring Tomahawk
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,2,"Forget the borefest and plot holes... am I the only person who was irritated by the incompetent directing? The shots/edits/sequences/sound effects were terrible and felt unnatural (far below average). The movie did not flow smoothly, and the horrendous dialogue by our one-dimensional characters did not help either.Despite all that, I still kept watching and had hope in the troglodytes and gore. But after 2 hours of nothing, I was further disappointed by the lame cave-dwellers as they did not strike me as terrifying nor brutal - they were stupid and slow.I do not understand how this movie got such high ratings (most likely because of the cast), and why many are complaining about it being gruesome and excessively violent. With the exception of one scene which only men would sympathize with, every other death was normal. We didn't even get to see them properly eat anyone."
" A Kurt Russell Western
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,8,"For being shot on the cheap in 31 days, there's a lot to digest here. In this era of action movies the pacing may be tough for some, but if you like westerns, movies with good character development, or Kurt Russell you'll like it. Nice to see an original movie that isn't a sequel or based on a comic book."
" Not your classic western
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,4,"There's a piece in Granta written during the Bosnia war in the '90s that spent many pages describing the beauty of both the natural environment and the multiple cultures coexisting there. It then introduced a random guy who was hunting in the mountains to feed his family. An army patrol came upon him totally by accident and, after some dialogue, determined he was of the opposing ethnic group. They subsequently abused him and, slicing the skin at both the bottom of his spine and at his neck, inserted a pole along his spinal column under the skin, hung him between two trees and proceeded to roast him, apparently for the fun of it. This event was shocking within the idyllic literary context of what had preceded it and had the effect on the reader of having been mentally raped.Bone Tomahawk has a little of this quality. Along with some prurient fluff and desert travelogue, the film reflects the hard, unromanticised existential barrenness associated with Cormac McCarthy's work about the old West, tinged with a little bit of Larry McMurtry's Blue Duck. The characterizations reflect the settler's resignation of everyone understanding their roles, as well as the inevitably of them walking into a fate ultimately beyond their control, all the while making conscious choices to fulfill them. The representation of the savage's cosmology with the rock circles was left unexplained, but was a crudely constructed representation for a culture totally beyond the comprehension of the settler's (i.e. weird sounds, bones in cheeks). All that is presumed by the viewer is the lethal consequences when these two cultures came into contact with one another. The film doesn't really prompt us to ask any questions, only to accept the cowboys-and-Indians dynamic, while at the same time suggesting maybe we should be asking questions. (And recall the scene in the bar with the palpably demeaning ""racial"" hostility of the ""professor"" when being quizzed on the nature of the possible assailants.) And obviously, similar to the in the Granta piece, the jarring visualized butchering was a bit much and sort of unnecessary, a violent reality whose cruelty we don't want to admit we understand or have the capacity for, although it did move the story to its climax.Life in the West was brutish and often short. What seems like a slow pace is the result of our expectations based on standard commercial films bathing us in action and visual fireworks. I suppose that begs the question of whether I would either recommend this movie or watch it again. On both accounts, I'd have to say no."
" They closed the doors!
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,10,"Me of the few times I've ever seen any films close a Flipping door! Roughly 35 minutes in and Kurt Russel goes out of his way to shut a door! Freaking brilliant, revolutionary filmmaking, hopefully filmmakers will take a cue from this movie and have more doors closed on set, 10/10 will watch Kurt Russel shut that door again."
" Unexpected goodness
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,9,"I had little expectations but was really happy I watched this one.A no-nonsense, gritty western flick with a witty undertone, great acting and old school cinematography with no shaking cameras or any other nonsensical gimmicks they throw at us constantly these days. And foremost: No idiocy or dumb gaps in the plotline, however silly it might be otherwise.The dialogue and the story aren't great, let's be honest, but there's something REAL about this movie and there are very relatable scenes portrayed for any man watching this movie. And I do mean men audiences. Any woman who appreciates this one is a rarity and I'd marry her in a heartbeat.A rare gem, highly recommended."
" A Good Graphic and Gritty Western/Horror Story
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,7,"I cannot recall when I've watched a film that combined the elements of a cowboy movie and a horror story so well. They didn't even use anything supernatural and they still pulled it off! Their use shocking imagery and violence made you really feel like the sh#t had hit the fan once the ""Savages"" were around. Once that happens, there is no ""down time"". The action is nonstop! Don't watch this if you can't handle gratuitous violence."
" B-movie content in quality wrapping
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,8,"If you have stomach for extreme violence, this is pretty good. A simple, but exciting story, heightened by very good craftsmanship and excellent actors. All of them are putting in good work, but I'd say that Richard Jenkins comes out best. He turns what could have been a throwaway comic relief-character into an interesting, deep and real human that ends up as the movie's heart and driving force."
" ""Ain't No Concern Of A Civilized Man!""...
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,9,"When two bushwhacking brigands named Purvis and Buddy (David Arquette and Sid Haig) go into the hills during an escape from the law, they inadvertently wander through what appears to be sacred ground. This is... unwise, and leads to death and abduction in the town of Bright Hope. Soon, the sheriff (Kurt Russell) organizes a posse to track down those responsible. Adventure and terror unfold.BONE TOMAHAWK is anything but a typical western. It's a horror film set in the old west, containing brutal violence and cannibalism. What makes it work are the strong, believable characters played by outstanding actors (Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins, et al.) and intelligent dialogue. There's also a healthy dose of humor throughout, to help offset the extremely grisly occurrences to come.Much like SLAVE OF THE CANNIBAL GOD and CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, the most horrifically graphic elements are saved for the final act. In the end, this is a satisfying movie with a solid story. Director, S. Craig Zahler deserves credit for making the most of a modest budget. An impressive effort..."
" What a solid movie!
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie was way better than I thought it was going to be! I went in just expecting a B-movie monster flick, what I got was a movie with great dialogue, solid actors and a great story!"
" Cannibalistic Cave Dwellers - No thanks
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,1,"Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors.
Some of his movies we have in our home library are Deepwater Horizon, Used Cars, Tombstone, Backdraft, 3,000 Miles to Graceland, Silkwood, etc.
I also have a good selection of Quentin Tarantino movies in our collection.
As a matter of fact, I think we've even got a copy of Natural Born Killers laying around here somewhere.
They must have paid Kurt a lot of money to make this freak show because after watching the little black boy get killed in the barn, we kicked it out of our VCR and threw it away.
""Bone Tomahawk"" c2015, has way too much vivid, brutal, realistic acts of violence, blood and gore for us.
Most teenagers would probably enjoy watching cannibalistic cave dwellers at work, but for us - no thanks."
" Classic Western with Modern Grittiness
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,8,"This is a slow burning classic western film, it's well written and well acted with some fairly graphic violence. Reading the other reviews, I think some people were expecting a fast paced action film, which this definitely isnt.The characters are built up meticulously, the dangers of the wild west are in your face and the violence isn't gratuitous. Some of the more graphic scenes made me wince, but they were part of the story and not just for the sake of it; they showed plainly what happened to people when they were caught by some tribes back then.To be honest, concentrating on the gruesome bits would be to miss the great story telling, humour from the old timer and selflessness. It's a bit like the modern True Grit with a few grim bits."
" Horrible dialogue, bad acting, terrible movie
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,1,Such a bad movie. The interaction between the characters was terrible. Slow. Everything was bad
" Good Movie - just too long
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,6,I enjoyed this film but it was over long. The characters were built well and you cared about them.So sad that it took so long to cut to the chase. It pretty much felt like a western til about 1hr 30.The trogs were v good.Overall - just too long.
" Grisly, compelling slow burn that's worth the wait
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,8,"A horror/western genre mix may sound odd at first, but Bone Tomahawk is a brilliant example of why it should be a thing that happens more often. A simple premise and plot line allows the brilliant acting, script, and atmosphere-building to really shine. This is a true slow-burn horror film that carefully builds a sense of dread, and leads to a spectacularly awful climactic ending.This film is not for newbies, and certainly not for those with weak stomachs. I consider myself a pretty seasoned horror film watcher, and this movie will stick with me for a long time. It requires a bit of patience, but the payoff is worth it, and the journey there is beautiful."
" Paid Reviews? Or did I watch a different film?
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,5,"Horrible acting with the exception of Chicory (Richard Jenkins) and Brooder (Matthew Fox's finest work, I think) were STELLAR (one, convincing cool, calm and collected no matter the situation and the other, endearingly simple)...an absolutely ABYSMAL performance by Kurt Russell (it was like he didn't want to be in it and I can't blame him) and SOOOOO achingly slow and drudging, my husband, who loves Westerns, refused to finish watching it.I guess all the people whining about how brutal it was, don't know much about the old West. Scalping isn't a foreign concept...I've seen it in many Westerns and torturing people... seriously? That still happens today! You think it didn't happen back then?The cliched sex scene turned me off from the beginning. Was that the only way you thought you could get people to watch? Women like horror too and if I want to see hoots...I have my own if I want to look at them; thanks.Terrible movie, slow pacing, and the only reason I'm giving it a five is due to the brutality, which seemed realistic enough."
" A brutal, unapologetic delight
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,9,"Make no mistake, Bone Tomahawk is not an easy watch. Those of us with light hearts will not find any joy with this film.The performance of the entire cast from top to bottom billing is stellar. Even some of the cast members with smaller parts and, perhaps not known for their acting chops, seem to give maximum effort and it pays. Of course, when speaking of the performances, special mention has to be saved for Kurt Russell. His range and ability to keep you engaged is no more evident than in this movie. Patrick Wilson also gives a strong performance but again, that can be said for everyone involved.The visuals of the old West are immersive and grounded, you feel like you're in the location, and with it, the peril of the situation these characters find themselves in, resonates more. There doesn't seem to be a lot of CGI or studio trickery, even for some of the more gruesome parts which I commend. If something looks like it's been tampered with in post-production, it can be jarring and take you out but this film takes no such steps.My one criticism, and it's a minor one, is the length. The pace is slow which absolutely works in the story's favour, but a slow burning movie at 2hrs and 10mins won't sit well with some people. I totally understand why it's slow paced but had they shaved 10/15 mins off, it probably would have had the same desired effect.This is a film that needs to be experienced and the less I say about plot points, the better. It is 100% worth a watch.Anybody looking for a movie to consume that feels like a storyline in the Red Dead Redemption franchise, this one's for you."
" This is Gonna Be a Classic - Second Viewing - 9/10
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,9,"This film is fantastic. Matthew Fox is fantastic. Richard Jenkins kills it. Kurt Russell is fantastic. Patrick Wilson is great. Everyone else is ALSO REALLY REALLY GOOD. The music, tension, practical effects, script, acting, all the technical aspects... this is a damn near perfect film. If you like Westerns, watch this. If you like horror films, watch this. If you like good films, WATCH THIS."
" Gruesome Western with a Twist of Sadistic Horror
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,7,"I love Westerns, but this movie is not like any Western I have ever seen. It is absolutely horrifying. The movie started out as any Western would, but then it went all down hill....scarily down hill. I thought the movie, Homesman with Tommy Lee Jones and Hillary Swank was brutal, but this movie took the cake. I don't regret watching it, but I don't think I would recommend it except to the hardcore horror freaks. If you're squeamish, do not watch this movie."
" Tarantino meets Cohen Brothers meets Cimino
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,5,"Came across this on Prime, and thought both the cast and description made it look interesting. After checking out the first page or so of reviews here, my interest was further heightened. So, I, along with some family members, sat down for what I thought would be a gore-fest with an interesting story (perhaps something like Tarantino's ""From Dusk 'Til Dawn""). It started out promisingly enough, but then descended into an overly long, actionless, sometimes amusing but not nearly enough, trek across the west. We eventually started to fast-forward, looking for something interesting to happen, and finally came across such with about 40 or so minutes left in the film (when the group finally catches up with the protagonists). I think this could have easily been edited down to about 90 minutes, perhaps even less. The gore that did finally occur was well-done. My recommendation would be to watch the first half-hour or so, then fast-forward to the last 40 minutes. That should keep you awake and entertained."
" Unique Horror Western
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,8,"The film's critiques were so harsh, and the trailer so odd that I promptly decided to give BONE TOMAHAWK a wide berth. In the end, I only went along because my son insisted I should see it, adding that it reminded him of a Tarantino film. To humor my boy, I went along and, as it turns out, I enjoyed it.Direction is really good for such a wayward project; acting, especially by Russell and Richard Jenkins, is excellent; cinematography and stunts are awesome; the script is uneven at times, but certainly gripping throughout; and it does not feel overlong, despite its 132 minutes. In fact, its length made me more aware of the characters' problems as they overcome various perils and obstacles.I did not care for the Tarantino-like gore, especially in the scenes in the mountain grotto, but that negative aspect is not enough seriously to diminish my considerable enjoyment watching BONE TOMAHAWK."
" Best film of the decade for me.
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely loved this movie. It's brings together so many different genres, while boasting a great cast. The special effects were top notch and this movie had one of the most brutal kill scenes you will likely ever see. Check it out if you're into westerns and horror movies, or like me, into both and love Kurt Russell!"
" Competent, focused, and satisfying.
",2019-08-23 00:00:00,7,"Bone Tomahawk is a movie that is done well but dissapoints in some areas.
I'll start with the good parts. The acting is top of the line, with every character feeling natural and realistic. There isn't any theatrical dialogue. Most of the talking is southernly and calm, what a dinky Western town like Bright Hope would have. The lighting is realistic, which is a massive plus. On top of that the way the film is shot compliments each scene, making each character pop when they speak.
Now I'll complain. The sound design is perfect up until people start to get mangled. The way the brutal kills sound really throws me for a loop because of how excessive and needless it feels. I hoped the sound would be muffled for the most part but slicing and dicing sounds crystal clear. The story also makes little logical sense. Arthur is a worthless character to bring along other than for plot convenience. A lot is left to be desired near the end, which also feels super rushed. A few extra shots would have helped fatten up sections that were other wise bare bones. The beginning isnt perfect either, especially with the realistic aura of the film. How is someone to believe that after eleven days the main catalyst of the film didn't just die in the desert? If he knew Bright Hope was where it was, how come the sheriff and deputy sheriff treat him like a complete stranger, even though they seem to know a lot about their town? Why did they only take 4 people instead of most of the townsmen, especially after the professor told them what they were up against? How have the troglodytes survived so long? How does the professor even know they exist, considering their aggressiveness and that most people who encounter them die? Most of these are nitpicks that could be resolved after a rewatch, but stand out as post-watching questions that require answers. The reason this film is getting a 7 instead of a 6 or 5 is because I believe the combination of the horror and Western elements of the film play perfectly off of each other, making horrendous scenes of violence explode unto the faces of viewers."
" If you can get through the first 90 mins......

",2019-08-12 00:00:00,9,I don't really like westerns but I do love horror and the just plain bizarre. Watched this about a month ago and it haunted it me so much that I'm now watching it again. Very good story telling!
" Facial hair versus ashy skin
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,7,"Bone Tomahawk (what a great title!) is a real genre mashup, horror and western - the likes of which you've probably not seen before. The action is light until the final third of the film or so, bu the tension that steadily mounts in the first two-thirds will have you jumping at bells jingling and other startling sounds. Seems a prisoner, a deputy, and the doctor charged with removing the bullet from the prisoner's leg have all vanished over the course of the night. The sheriff (Kurt Russell) sets out to find the trio, aided by his backup to the deputy (Richard Jenkins), a learned man with a predilection for killing Indians (Matthew Fox), and the doctor's husband (Patrick Wilson), who's nursing a bad leg. The lone Indian in their tiny western town is pretty sure who did the kidnapping, based off an arrow found in the jail, and he's of the opinion that it's a group of cave-dwellers - troglodytes. As the sheriff and his posse search, tensions mount among them, and the leg of the doctor's husband acts up time and time again. What they do find when they finally come upon the cave holding the captives and their intimidating captors isn't quite the run-of-the-mill stuff you'd find in an old Western, and that's where the action, terrifying and fleet but so satisfying, kicks in. Bone Tomahawk makes hay out of the long trek to find the trio, and the tribulations of life on the trail, particularly as the men run low on provisions, is expertly told and lends a true sense of realism to the proceedings. Aside from that mounting tension, the first half is pulled together wonderfully by Russell and by Jenkins as the addled backup tin star. Jenkins steals the movie."
" Fantastic Movie
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,8,"Perfect mix of western and horror. Acting is top notch, Mathew Fox, Kurt Russell and Richard Jenkins are amazing."
" Extremely long for no reason
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,3,Film was way too long for what it was and its rated extremely gorey but very little
" A Ruff Story
",2019-07-18 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic piece - a Western with a nice addition of horror elements. Gruesome and relentless sometimes, and on top we get good acting by Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson and others and a fine production. Bone Tomahawk is really a rich dish for the connoisseur of the unusual."
" The other reviews are generous
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,6,"The film started out a well-filmed western, but tailed off. The later parts were slow and repetitive, and the tribe were poorly conceived. Some of the violence was gratuitous without fitting into a plausible narrative. It could have been done a little better."
" The lovechild of True Grit and The Hills Have Eyes
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,9,"Bone Tomahawk is phenomenal.You have to split it down into its sub-genres and it nails every single one. As a western it's similar to that of True Grit and is certainly worthy of that accolade, it's pithy, gruelling and harsh. Watching the rancher drag his broken leg around for 5 days is painful to watch, and thats before you hit any of the moments of horror.The horror element is exceptional, if, in my opinion, a little short. The deaths are as gruesome as they are realistic and you can't tear your eyes away, although during one you wish you could.Bone Tomahawk is fantastic, it's cast are exceptional and Kurt Russell puts in one of his best performances. Laden with tension, gore, fear and very dry humour, this film promises to grip you and never let go."
" Crazy movie
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,8,Crazy but good. Could almost be a Tarantino-movie.
" AN INSTANT CLASSIC!!! ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,8,"Bone Tomahawk is absolutely Brilliant & just as great if not better than Tarantino's Hateful 8 also starring Hollywood legend Kurt Russell!!!!
Bet Tarantino wished he made this? & bet he loves it.This is a brutal,gritty as hell real western Horror it's a terrifying rescue mission attempted by four brave townsmen entering an extremely dangerous enemy territory of savages to rescue a wife of one the men & a deputy.The elements are harsh & tough here this is not a glamorous western in any way at all no this is real & dangerous & harsh.
The gritty realism creates a scary atmosphere.
The performances are all OUTSTANDING by each actor & i mean that each actor gives probably their greatest performance or atleast from what I've seen!!!
Kurt Russell,Mathew Fox,Richard Jenkins & Patrick Wilson are absolutely Brilliant in their roles!!! Each character is so well played & created on screen i felt for each person & cared completely for each man on this suicide mission into a cannibal savage land it's powerful stuff here.
Raw,bleak,bloody,brutal & brilliant.
The violence is brutal as hell & sharp & fast & unexpected it's shocking!!!This is truly an instant CLASSIC INFACT it's a MASTERPIECE of cinema especially of the western & the Horror genres.
ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT"
" Slow Burning Western
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,8,"So while I am eagerly awaiting to watch the newest or most current movie the director has made (Dragged across concrete), I#ll pass the time reviewing this one. Now Western movies are a genre that are not for everyone to begin with. But if you love them, you will know there are different kinds of Western movies out there, depicting ""cowboys"" in different ways and being either idolizing or breaking down myths.Now this is a different beast, because it adds occult and fantasy into the mix. It also is quite violent. So not something for the squeamish. If you can stomach whatever it is you are getting served, than you will get a movie with some stunning cinematography and great acting. Just because there is action though does not mean, this goes by in a snap. It actually might feel like it is dragging (no pun intended). But the slow pace juxtoposes the violence in a really efficient way and give us the viewer a bit of room to breathe ... also the characters involved in this. Realistic if you discount the otherworldly/spiritual themes and heavy ... also quite amazing"
" A mediocre Hostel-lish western/horror movie
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,1,"Good actors, bad acting, no storyline, mediocre production. Disgusting and exaggerated violence scenes are made on purpose to feature the movie, since the rest of the movie is simply cheap.They simply tried to shoot a western movie in Hostel style.If you don't want to waste 2 hours of your time, stay away from this movie. Even to lay down in your bed and watch the ceiling for 2 hours is a much better and fun activity than watching this mediocre movie."
" Poorly written
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,3,The concept and directing leave much to be desired. A waste of talent.
" I liked it
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,7,"This was a solid movie. The acting is quite good, the characters are unique and interesting, and the action is worth the wait. Matthew Fox delivers a great performance."
" Good Movie
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Went into this movie with no expectations
But after five minutes I felt I was in for a treat and I wasn't wrong it had a good mix of gory horror and action it's one of those films your think about afterward and say to yourself that's a good movie I'll watch that again fairly soon and your enjoy it even more the second time around. Do yourself a favour sit back with these lights down low and enjoy the movie I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
" Prime Level Western-Horror
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,10,"See this movie and see it now. I've been a constant visitor to IMDb for many many years but never felt the need to review a movie. Say what you will about that but this movie pushed me over the edge.The pacing was inexorable, the combat was in short, visceral and highly exhilarating bursts and the characters were extremely well acted with writing to make them into real people. What tied it all together was an absolute haunting soundtrack.This being my first review, I'm not going to dive into detail like many others have done below. All I can say is this movie does so many things right, that the things it may do wrong were entirely lost on me. I'm not even a fan of Westerns, and only in recent years has my interest in them peaked. See this movie, and see it now."
" Absolute modern day masterpiece that somehow slipped below the radar.
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,9,"This is the first review I've done in over 10 years but felt it needed to be done.After watching this film one of the main things that struck me was how the hell did this slip under the radar. Then I soon realized how. The film industry and cinemas were clogged up with utter garbage CGI superhero movies that cater for the masses. Sure there is a place for this junk food for the brain but it creates a vacuum behind and some classics fall into this and disappear into the abyss.I wont spoil the film but what we get here is a cast of well known actor's without the need to show off six packs and muscle ripped unrealistic bodies. This is pure acting in all its glory and how filmmakers should take note.The story starts with a brief introduction of what is to come. It plants a seed in the audiences mind but doesn't give too much away keeping you intrigued. Then we have a atmospheric dusty frontier town with a local sheriff and its few townsfolk. Following an incident that leads to an abduction we have our 4 characters quickly scrambling to mount a search and rescue operation.This is where the film comes into it's own. The filming and scenery is just fantastic and creates that ""out there"" exposed feeling. The film then starts to show the different qualities of each character. This is where you start to bond with each character and each one possesses his own quality that adds to the overall mission....no superpowers in sight just pure bare bones and great acting.The mission ticks along at the right pace sucking the viewer deeper into it.y You start to think what would you do... and before you know it you are almost In the wilderness with them.The tension builds throughout and following several occurrences our gang are cut adrift and past the point of no return. Then the film takes an unexpected turn and will catch audiences off guard. Imagine ""dusk till dawn"" but without the unrealistic aspect of vampires and CGI crap. We have a horrifying reality that requires a strong stomach but will keep you gripped until the last minute.That's where I'll leave it.....I gave it 9 out of 10 because to go against the grain of modern day garbage and take it back to good old good acting and filming locations this brings the art of filmmaking back to basics and delivers with such a punch that will shock.Go see it is all I can say."
" Spartan and brutal. Kind of refreshing actually.
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,8,"So, I saw Brawl in Cell Block 99 a few months ago. Mainly on a whim. Had no idea what kind of film it was until the violence really kicked my teeth out. So I looked around to see what else this director has had a hand in. Mainly Dragged Across Concrete, which is yet to be released here as far as I know, and this here Bone Tomahawk.So I now sat down to see if it would be in the same vein. And afterwards I can say yes. It is similar in tone and style. The look felt a little cheaper. Something about the lighting I guess. But the point in it isn't to be pretty. There are nice views but it isn't the point. The point is to tell an old school gut punching western. The kind that I've read about that's supposed to have been all the rage during right about the time the film is set. There is no frill. No hiding the ugly. And they barely got away with depicting native americans as unholy beasts by simply having a more regular indian in civilised clothes describe the villain tribe as troglodytes. Like Brawl it skates past on a razor sharp edge.In most eyes probably barely defendable. The dialog is gruff. The violence is ugly. The morals, even among the heroes, is described as unquestionable, simply because of the lack of it.And yet. Like Brawl. There's a brutal honesty to it. And I think at the halfway point, or thereabouts, I noticed that there haven't been any music. It is a sparse movie told with as little in the way of sugarcoating as they could manage. And in a movie landscape with so much excess in everything but the violence, to see one or two really double down on depicting the ugliness of it. It was kind of refreshing.Now I'm even more excited to see what Dragged Across Concrete can provide. Because I think this director is one to keep an eye on."
" Horror Western...
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,10,"Bone Tomahawk is a western written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, and it is a film that made me think of Cormac McCarthy. Instead of savage tribes of Indians, Mexicans and white vigilantes we had a wordless group of primitive troglodytes. Unthinkingly cruel to themselves as much as others, they blind women and impregnate them, drive bone whistles into their own throats to make signal calls; they are casual cannibals. It is a peculiar and powerful film, with an original blend of horror. There are admirable performances from Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins (always brilliant), Patrick Wilson and Matthew Fox. A Western for sure, but with a highly original take on an old genre. If the Western is constantly declared dead it is as constantly resurrected. Along comes Missouri Breaks, The Unforgiven, True Grit, No Country For Old Men, or The Homesman. I still dread anyone taking on Blood Meridian, but Bone Tomahawk has some of that mighty book's power and essence. I was mesmerised by it. Horror western? Certainly, I was peeping through my fingers a few times."
" A nutrient in the art department
",2019-03-19 00:00:00,10,"Once I heard Clint Eastwood saying making a good movie is really about finding a good story. A captivating genuine story often can empower performances and directing within its realm and deliver a single piece of art to its audience.Bone Tomahawk is more than that. It's so powerful in its realism, so meticulous in every second of performances, so discreet in its promise, and so thorough in its delivery that it feels fulfilled in the gut after watching. It's a nutrient in the art department.I noticed some reviewers tried to classify it as western, horror, or drama. Some noticed some racial nuances. Let me state this, though, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because the story teller and the director didn't think about it, and it's a good thing too. A genuine story shouldn't regard restrictions of any kind. Classifications can be left to the critics.Performances are striking. I carefully watched every single move and every single sentence of K. Russell as a sheriff, and he makes solid sense in every second. He is not only so convincing, but also so attractive character that rivets the viewer. Emotions passing his face deep and transparent at the same time.Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, and Richard Jenkins inhabit three fundamentally different characters that come together in a single journey. Merely curious interactions of their worldviews keep the audience very busy before they'll get to their destiny.The dialog are powerful, somewhat formal but never ungenuine. One feels precisely that the formality comes from the main characters themselves. Paying attention to other characters reveals that formality of the dialog is not a signature of the movie: it just happened that the main characters were so.The furnishing of the houses and the little admirable sketches of the family lives of the characters create a unique vantage, making the viewer feeling in the same room with the characters. And all of these, punctuate with horrid scenes, that comes natural to the characters' environment, creates a solid masterpiece of modern cinema.I predict this movie not to be hype, or cult, or otherwise recognized widely, the reason being no clear bad characters, but rather accidentally bad situations. These might make some simplistic viewers unreachable to the movie. But it will be recognized by the few sophisticated viewers as an accomplished art with its solid place in the world cinema."
" Nearly a masterpiece, but instead a complete waste
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,5,"""... so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.""I feel rather this way about ""that scene"" in Bone Tomahawk. And even more so for a throwaway scene at the end. I felt both crossed far over the normal ""shock"" line, and were there merely to titillate and generate controversy. In fact the last 20 minutes of Bone Tomahawk undoes everything the rest of the movie built towards, by descending into the unrealistic-bordering-on-supernatural. This just broke the suspension of disbelief for me. It felt like the grown-up staff left the film set and let a bunch of teenage boys carry on making the final few minutes of the movie.It's a real shame, because the rest of the movie is absolutely astonishing. The pace, camerawork, dialogue (for the most part) builds the impending dread beautifully. This is a finely crafted horror film hiding in a very convincing western skin. Despite the long running time, It's difficult to tear your eyes away... until the moment when the filmmakers clearly decided they were going to force you to do that. And as the credits roll, those scenes are pretty much all you'll remember (every time you shut your eyes).SPOILERS
Specifically, I feel Nick would have passed out from the pain long before the movie finally lets him. And can two people really tear a human carcass in half as easily as that? I doubt it. And the scene with the pregnant women... still alive, yet with stakes driven into their eyes and their limbs amputated... how would they still be pregnant or capable of bearing children in such a stressful situation? In fact, how were they still alive at all?"
" Awesome movie
",2019-03-14 00:00:00,10,"Kurt Russell and Richard Jenkins are phenomenal. The rest of the cast is fine. The production design, make up, and horror effects were fantastic. A thrilling ride. Highly recommended."
" Lost clan of Troglodytes in an unusual Western!!!
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,8,"When l'd bought this western with Kurt Russell l had thought one more weak western to Russell got a few dollars more, l never was too wrong, the picture starts slowly but will getting stronger noticed by the viewers, the unexpected subject was the key issue to success, instead a native indians an ancient clan of Troglodytes from stone age, on the middle they already face the Cavemen and sent to the cave on a small jail to be eaten later, how they killed the prey was horrible to discribed in words, so stay a last hope to a guy who they left behind with a leg's wounded, fantastic mix of genre with western and horror, a weak point were a old man played by Richard Jenkins and the an injuried young guy accepted to pursuit the indians in such conditions, also they could had chosen a better landscape to increase substantially as backdrop of the picture, even so a magnificent and offbeat production!!!Resume:First watch: 2019 / How many: 1 / Source: DVD / Rating: 8.5"
" I was surprised I liked it as much as I did
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,7,"I had avoided this one (Netflix) mainly because I'm not a fan of Kurt Russell, and not really keen on westerns...but the horror angle had the potential to make it more interesting, which it did.The premise seems to be directly lifted from the 2008 movie, The Burrowers (TB). For the genre, each has surprisingly good casting, and by extension, really sound acting. I liked the characters in each of them.Bone Tomahawk (BT) got around the issue of believable creatures by just not going there: they used a creepy humanoid species instead. That's the main ""horror week spot"" of TB, they opted for creatures which look in large part as actors wearing prosthetics, and I imagine some CGI.In fact, the parts I liked best in BT were more the characters on the trail, their predicaments, and their interactions, more than the horror aspect.I wasn't sure who would still be left standing by the end, and my feeling was that Kurt Russell might have it in his contract that he would be one of them :-). No comment on how that plays out. For sure my favourite character was 'Chicory' played by Richard Jenkins.Some people will find it long (I don't mind long movies ) at slightly over two hours, but I found it held my interest throughout."
" Bonehead Hematoma
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,2,"Horror with an old West setting can be wonderful: Ravenous is a prime example. Although Bone Tomahawk has a lot going for it (the script, the actors, the photography), the payoff is about as fun as visiting a slaughterhouse. The cannibals are simply ludicrous. They shamble on and off screen like a defeated football team from whatever planet spawned Predator. You would have to be a complete historical illiterate to take this element seriously."
" Absolute trash
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,1,"I was expecting much more from an actor like Kurt Russell. Unnecessary ultra violent scenes that only sadistic people like. Shame on Netflix and shame on the entire cast and crew of this film. Full of racism against natives as well as blacks. Story is utlra weak, characters are confused and not developed at all. After watching the movie I had a very bad feeling."
" Won't Be Watching Again
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,1,"This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen... and I love both western and horror movie genres. I didn't even realize this was a horror. I thought it was going to be another great Kurt Russell western like Tombstone.This movie was just too slow. So much so I fell asleep through about 20 minutes of it. The characters were interesting and the acting was good... it just took forever to build up the story.Then there's that third act. Sometimes filmmakers just go too far. The kill scene in this movie makes watching two big dinosaurs rip a man in half seem merciful. I get it... they want to shock the viewers. But for me, this was just unnecessarily brutal and graphic. If you think you've seen it all and have been desensitized thanks to movies like Hostel or Saw, you would be very mistaken. You. Haven't. Seen. Anything. Yet!The Motion Picture Association needs another rating beyond R for movies like this."
" Cannibals in the Old West
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,8,"As this film opens a pair of murderous thieves bushwhack two men as they sleep; hearing approaching horses they flee to a remote valley where one of them is killed by members of a tribe of cannibalistic troglodytes. The other escapes to the town of Bright Hope, where he is arrested. During the course of his arrest he is shot in the leg and Samantha O'Dwyer is called to tend for him. That night the savages raid the town; stealing horses, killing a stable boy and taking everybody in the town jail... Mrs O'Dwyer, the deputy and the prisoner. The next day an unlikely foursome set out to rescue them; Sheriff Franklin Hunt; his elderly Deputy 'Chicory' Kory; gunslinger John Brooder; and Arthur O'Dwyer, Samantha's husband who insists on accompanying them despite having a broken leg following an accident. The journey will be tough and they will face a variety of adversities before they ultimately reach the savages in the 'Valley of the Starving Men'... then they will face their greatest danger yet.For the most part this is a classic western in the mould of 'The Searchers' with settlers trying to retrieve kidnapped people. The early part of the film does a fine job of introducing the key characters without telling us too much about the cannibal tribe. The journey section goes through impressive scenery which creates a good feeling of their distance from any potential help. When they get to their destination the sense of tension increases significantly. Some of what we then see wouldn't be out of place in a horror movie; this includes some very disturbing sights. The cast does a fine job; notably the four leads Kurt Russell as the Sheriff; Patrick Wilson as Arthur O'Dwyer; Richard Jenkins 'Chicory'; and Matthew Fox as John Brooder. Lili Simmons impresses as Samantha O'Dwyer although her role is smaller. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of westerns who also like horror films... or vice versa even though it is more western than horror."
" Solid Movie
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,9,All around a solid movie. The acting was good. The story was good. The action was really good.
" Mediocre
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,6,Was a slow movie and then last half hour everything gets finished. During the main plot of the movie there are moments. But the ending where the guy gets chopped in half; disgusting!
" Disappointing revulsion.
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,3,"First, the minimalist acting style that is becoming more common in certain types of independent film doesn't sit well with me. And in a Western that tends for gritty simple one tone expression, having this apparent minimalist expression just falls flat. Story line was flat with blunted characters just appear and then go as the story shifted. There was no character development simply caricatures of stereotypes of western roles. Adding the cannibalism to this film seemed to be a way for us to care about the flat caricatures that didn't pull for any empathy outside of ""Oh no that would be inhuman!"" Just a flat mess of an idea that seems to be ""unique"" because this is the first western film to merge with cannibalism (or if not the first the most graphic in its depiction?). As a fan of horror films, this was just unsettling without any horror, just the revulsion of inhumanity. As a lesser fan of westerns but decidedly a fan of epic and thoughtful ones, this was disappointing given what they could have tried to convey but seemed incapable of making a larger societal allegory that was hinted in small moments. Basically, the film conveyed ""Old West was hard, and you have to be strong to survive because humans can be inhuman monsters"". Disappointing. Revolting."
" A Fantastic Film
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,10,"This was a lovely little movie that just appeared out of the blue, upon viewing It's easily one of the best modern westerns, S. Craig Zahler did a wonderful job crafting this film. It starts strong, builds character, and has incredible explosions of realistic violence.The acting is strong and the directing is excellent, and the effects are incredible. I have nothing but good things to say.One thing that may bother some people about this movie is the fact that the group of murderous savages are Native American. but this is countered early in the film when a Native American professor explains that this tribe is populated by troglodytes, ""No tribe claims these people, they're cave dwellers that would eat their own mothers."" So that detail didn't bother me.Give it a watch, it's very good."
" Interesting and fresh take on the genre
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Bone Tomahawk is an interesting mixture of western and horror that bows its head in respect to the legacy of both genres without residing too much into banal humour. An entertaining piece despite its slowish pace that goes well with the earie desert landscapes. Though the story is simple, and the charathers somewhat cartoonish, the screenplay is superb. The director does a great job on instilling a sense of horror and suspence."
" A future classic!
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,9,"I was amazed how good this movie is! Didn't expect all that much, just some mindless fun and violence, but this movie has it all! From good performances and story, to characters you like and care for. Also, it's creeping you out with that constant feeling of dread and hopelessness and isolation which is priceless for a good horror movie. Oh, and it has Kurt Russel starring as a badass old sheriff! If that didn't convince you to watch, I sure won't :P"
" Why Kurt, why?
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,1,"The writing and directing was terrible. Did Kurt Russell lose a bet? Critics consensus on Rotten Tomatoes refer to this movie with ""gripping performances and a slow-burning story"". Fast or slow, a burn is painful."
" Total and utter waste of time
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,1,The worst kind of meaningless splatter movie ever made. I am gobschmacked in a negative way. A bloody waste of time - 2 hours of absurdity!
" Basically snuff
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,1,"This movie mumbles through the first hour in a seemingly endless walk to find some ""troglodytes"" and by the time action starts, it's basically self-indulgent Sadism. The gore is over-done, pretty much shock-graphics to try and cover for a mindlessly violent, and sorely lacking plot. Save yourself the trouble and boredom."
" VERY, VERY GOOD FILM!
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,9,"Wow i Just absolutly love this movie.. it is Just such a great story..i wish people would Just give it a chance...So it may be a little slow at times, but its honestly just the story developing, but when it gets going, oh man look out!....I dont remember the last time I was on the edge of my seat yelling at the screen rooting for the characters to get out of the disturbing situation they were placed in... definitely give this movie a try... its over 2 hours long and I honestly didnt even feel it... its that good!"
" Slow moving film
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,3,The picture got awards which is amazing. Very slow moving movie. Brutal killings and beheadings everybody getting shot is the whole storyline. I hated It.
" Disturbing
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,7,Most disturbing western I've ever seen. Great cast though.
" Poignant, deep, heartbreaking
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,9,"With themes of redemption, sacrifice, and the will of the human spirit, this movie strikes at the core of the collective psyche of frontier life in the old west. The only fallible part I thought was the second acts plot pacing. Apart from that this movie is amazing. Recommend."
" Truthfully Violent
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,9,Without a doubt this is the most graphically violent western I've ever seen.But man 'o man. What an amazing film. A really well done story.
" Competent Western
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,7,"I'd love to give this movie more stars, but alas it was overly long, and for well over the first hour very little actually happened. If you like Westerns however, then this is a very good one, and you'll quickly fall in love with the Sheriff and his homely side-kick, and well as the town's dandy and many other characters, not least the renegade Indians and their fantastic attire. The dialogue is terrific and perfect for a Western, and for that reason alone this movie will easily survive into the future."
" The 'New Breed', has arrived.
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,9,"The exceptional 'Bone Tomahawk' is like a 'New Breed of Western. Almost plays like an art-house movie (as it ponders along) but the ending is like Soldier Blue x 10. The 'Savage West' has never been so beautifully and richly treated. Now at long last, you can call a 'Savage' a 'Savage' (just think how refreshing that really is?). Dream Catchers and Medicine Bags are out of the window, whilst Bone Tomahawks are way back (and thankfully) in fashion. Great directorial debut by Craig Zahla. A must see classic for any fans of the 'Western' genre, especially those who like the violent type."
" Whatever This Was Supposed To Be - It Was Bad
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,2,"From this movie's description I expected it to be a sort of western-horror hybrid. That could be enjoyable enough, so I settled in to watch it. But it wasn't really that horrific, and for long parts of the script it seems to be trying to be a sort of dry comedy with an element of mystery. Basically it's a bizarre hybrid of a whole lot of different genres that really didn't work together all that well.The movie started out strong enough, with a rather brutal murder depicted and, with one of the murderers being then killed himself by an arrow shot from somewhere by someone, you get the impression that there's going to be a lot of action in this. But then it settles down. It really settles. The remaining murderer is put in jail, tended to by a female doctor and guarded by a deputy - and then all three mysteriously disappear. Told by a local native man about a mysterious tribe of cannibals he calls ""troglodytes,"" the sheriff sets out with a small posse to find them and bring them home.And then we settle in for a marathon of nothing much happening. So little happened in fact that I literally fell asleep for a good 20 minutes - and I watched this in the middle of the afternoon. It does pick up in the last half hour or so when the posse finally encounters the troglodytes, and at that point the movie actually becomes graphically and at times unpleasantly violent as the posse and the troglodytes square off with each other.""Bone Tomahawk"" has a reasonably well known but certainly not A-list of actors (headed by Kurt Russell as the sheriff.) Sometimes they seem to be trying valiantly to make this work, but there are also scenes when they seem to realize it's a lost cause, and for the most part they're burdened with a script full of inanities. Once this was over I did go back and watch the 20 minutes or so that I fell asleep for. It didn't help. (2/10)"
" ALMOST lost me...then BANG! YOU GOT ME
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,8,"This movie drew me in with its brutal trailers and scenes on YouTube. I thought for sure it would be a wild-west ride to the end...It starts off quick, some men rob a bush-camping pair in the appropriate fashion, then getting themselves caught by some cave-dwelling savages. Said savages soon also stock their larder with a pretty doctor and a crook and deputy from a another raid on the small townlet of Bright Light.From there expect little blood until nearer the end when the rescue party turn up and are captured themselves. Cue brutal beatings, meal-prep in the form of chopping a (live) deputy in half and a sad escape where they leave one of their own behind (critically injured but functional) to settle the score with the surviving cave-dwellers while the survivors make their escape.Apart from the fact they had enough firepower to wreak havok on the few remaining freaks anyway and a newly-rescued doctor with a kit bag that could have assisted our dying hero, the ending resulted in the damsel in distress being rescued and reunited with her beau and the idiot back-up-deputy seemingly saving the day. All in all, a good watch for it's suspense, action and blood and for it's true Western theme. Recommended."
" Inappropriate
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,3,"The way that indigenous or native American people are portrayed in this movie, as inhuman cannibals, I find incredibly insensitive."
" Enjoyable if flawed gore-filled Western
",2018-10-10 00:00:00,7,"With a series of strange disappearances on his hands, the sheriff of a small Western town discovers that a group of cannibalistic cave-dwellers living nearby have kidnapped several members of the community and sets out with a posse of townspeople to battle the group and retrieve their friends.For the most part, this was an enjoyable if slightly flawed effort. Most of the films' positives are tied into the most impressive feature here which is the blood and gore involved in the kills. The bloodshed here is incredibly enjoyable, not just for the quantity but also the concept of what happens as the cave-dwellers display a penchant for the outright mutilation and dismemberment of their captives, including the show-stopping scene of ripping a person apart using primitive tools. Not only that, but the other kills and wounds that are featured here are just as enjoyable, ranging from the hacking up of bodies and firing of jagged arrows into their bodies or the field operation that's conducted on the one victim which really helps to pull this one out quite nicely. Coupled with the action-packed fun found in the battles throughout their compound which has a lot to really like about it, these here hold it up over its problem areas. Among the biggest issues here is the most obvious element of the film which is its extreme length. While it's still filled with plenty of enjoyable elements, the fact that this one is still so long due to such unnecessary aspects such as the overlong discussions between the men in the beginning or the conversations between the married couple which are completely bland and troublesome to get through. There's not much of anything interesting happening for so long here since the central sequence of the abduction is so early into the film that it's possible for some fun to be had with the early setup yet nothing much occurs of that early setup with so much time spent on the trail where this delves into such extreme stalling tactics to play itself out. The overlong shots of him walking through the desert don't amount to much, and from the in-fighting or run-ins with unneeded characters to further slow them down this section of the film is really overlong. As well as the lack of explanations for anything that goes on here, these are what lower this one overall.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language and Brief Nudity."
" Scary as hell!
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,9,"This movie is unlike most I've seen in that I can't remeber ever seeing another Horror/Western, but the cast is eclectic and superb, the story is captivating, and it's edge-of-your-seat from start to finish. One bit of warning: It is truly gruesome. The last 20-30 minutes, in particular isn't for the feint of heart (and especially not for kids)."
" Ponderous Ponderosa ""if you go down into the woods today...""
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,2,"Ponderous movie that overstays its welcome.... made me muse on the song ""if you go down into the woods today..."" you won't get many surprises.
Watched it because of Escape From NY and The Thing star... and the one from Sinister... did they do this for the cash? The writer, if there was one, had been made to watch the likes of Wrong Turn (the later ones....?) or Hills Have Eyes and knocked this out. What a shame as cowboys vs cavemen is not such a bad premise. It's the drawn out result that disappoints... clunky and quirky it has little to commend it as others have said.
Looking forward to the sequel...? Nope!"
" Enjoyable
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,8,Good film and good performances. Matthew Fox had a great role. Kurt Russell was great also. Reminded me a little of Chatos Land.

" Gruesome and horrific
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,1,Terrible movie no western feel at all. There was even mystical creatures in it like wtf.
" Not bad.. but boring.
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,6,"I didn't want to do that. I didn't want to dislike this film because I liked the premise and most of the execution. But god damn if it isn't an hour too long.
From the beginning I was absolutely astonished by the organic and natural feel of the direction. It hardly felt like written lines but characters expressing themselves. Perfect! Then as soon as the plot is revealed the movie starts dragging. There is actually a scene with a character describing the challenges of reading a book in a bathtub. And another character suggesting a table and towel. Why was this in the movie? Also the camera work was hardly impressive and kind of dull and uninspired. Another thing that really bothered me was the fact that this film thought it was so much better than it was. Wasting time with characters I couldn't find myself interested in at all. This certainly is a film that could have used a twist. After the first twenty minutes everything becomes unsurprising. The script was pretty good, with some actually good lines. Not enough to save it for me though.
It's really not a bad film. But basically a pointless one. As a film it gets a 7. As a piece of entertainment it get's a 4. Because I take film-making seriously it boils down to a score of 6 out of 10.
I almost fell asleep 3 times."
" ""The scene in the cave""
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,10,"So many of the reviews on here seemed to be fixated on the notorious ""scene in the cave."" Either you loved it or loathed it -- there is definitely no in-between feeling regarding it. I happened to not only love it but as several reviewers have previously stated, thought it was necessary to show/see it. Just as the middle third of the film feels rather slow and a bit tedious, it is meant to put us, the viewer, in the proverbial shoes of the characters we are watching. The filmmakers want us to feel what Sheriff Franklin Hunt and the others are feeling. And boy, do we ever!"
" Great Western-Horror
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,10,"Some may say that the Western genre is dead or close to dying at least - true every now and then you will get the occasional western, but recently I believe audiences have gotten use to the fact that these Westerns are more reflective on the traditional John Wayne style western film or are tongue in cheek with reference, think The Hateful Eight or Django Unchained. People expect Westerns now to be grey in morals, ethics and looks. But Bone Tomahawk - although grey - is unlike any modern Western by any standard. It feels more like a horror - and I'm not just talking about the buckets of blood and gore. I'm talking about the FEEL - the anxiety, tension and supremely uneasy (realistic even) feel of the film. It makes you grind your teeth and look away, yet also, somehow, the film is pretty comic, and at times I was laughing out loud. A brilliant film, not just of the Western or Horror genre, but also just in any genre."
" Bone Tomahawk
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,7,"A good mix of Western and Horror enhanced by dry humour, memorable bad guys (cannibals) and good performances.
There's some gory moments( fine with me) and perhaps it's slightly overlong, but it's a success in both genres."
" Saddening
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,1,"What starts as a good made western movie with good actors, scenery, atmosphere, etc. suddenly becomes a sickening slasherthing... On that point I was shocked about the vulgar too realistic slashertwist of this movie and wanted to quit watching it. I looked on and then suddenly the movie came to an abrupt stop... A waste of time!"
" Interesting concept turned shockporn.
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,3,"I love westerns, to include almost all of the modern westerns. I really liked the first 1/2 of this movie though I felt the writing of the dialog was way overly Pollyanna -but very interesting. I think the plot is very interesting and ""new."" Then it takes a very serious and hardcore shockporn turn. Seven was pretty hardcore back in the day, but it left almost all of it to the audience's imagination. This left nothing to the imagination, even leaving you to wonder about how the special effects were done. I skipped past and landed on another scene that was only slightly less gruesome. I quit after that. It surpassed Seven and many SAW movies in my opinion. Unrelatable violence is such a fun cinematic experience. Yay."
" Spot on
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,7,"Just saw this film,certainly a bit different,and ive got to say i really enjoyed it .the conversations were superb and the film had a smart atmosphere to it that just made me settle down and wanna see it.russell is spot on as a grissly sheriff and i think this is what he does best ,inspiring into us he will do right at whatever sort of cost to himself or his deputys .it wasnt the usual manly talk but i think what we would probably actually say in these situations ,chicory his ageing deputy constantly making light of situations that ae extremely dire.cant fault patrick stewart as usual and his determination to find his wife,even suffering a bad leg injury.yes also the film is not fast paced but i suffered not one moment of boredom finding each star interesting in a different way.it is very gory even the opening scene makes you cringe but that sets you up for the rest if the film .eventually without spoiling the film for you ,they do come up against an evil foe and what follows is a bloody battle and sickening scenes ,i would cross it between apocolypta and wyatt erp and would recommend it as a good adult movie ,enjoy."
" Wasted opportunity and poor executed flop... Do not waste your time watching it
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,1,"I rarely write reviews as surely not being close to ok writer or entertainment journalist, but had to voice disappointment about this movie and odd high rating which tricked me into wasting my time watching it.....First of all I am not taking anything from creators of the movie and effort made. I realise and always appreciate craft, creative efforts and overall production processes and values are big challenges in long run. Yet I was terribly surprised that with such good & established casted actors director and script writers managed to deliver such awful result. It is awful on almost every level of movie making. It could not even be salvaged by overall actors performances, and gosh you can tell they tried their best, especially Kurt Russel and Richard Jenkins. So lets start with basics.... 
Poorly designed interiors and town overall, on a budget for sure with props being dropped randomly used from prop house. Purely for that reason they lack authentic feel of the era and just look rushed and faked. 
Outdoors locations could be so much more considering idea of movie and they ended up looking as they were shot on some local hilly back yard of farmhouse... Few dusty hills and never ending tight shots of corners of small valleys...Cinematography is mostly below average. I mean it. Few shots are beautiful but they cannot take away 95% of just poor visual story telling. What happened to basic rules of composition ?! 
As mentioned before script is flawed with gaps which are hard to explain. they leave more question marks and head scratching rather than create plot which follows and makes sense. Dialogs seems to be quite coincidental as well as characters relationships and placement. Actors tried to create believable portrayals and you can tell their did their best but half of the movie they ended up flat and out of place. There is mere authenticity in story itself and there is no plot twist as well. Some gory scenes that ad just brutality rather than any essence to story. I was quite angry with myself that I committed to watch this movie to the end. 
Please do not repeat my mistake. Movie is low budget creation and overrated. 4/10"
" One line

" Only Watch on Empty Stomach
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,1,"Don't allow yourself to be fooled by how exceptional a job this film does in slow-playing the viewer, as it is reminiscent for pilots, of an almost uneventful 100 minute flight that, ends up hobbling it's way through the final 33-minutes, of some of the worse unknown turbulence & thunderstorms ever survived aerodynamically. [And, casting Kurt Russel as the quintessential, badass lawman, only helps aid & abet the audience in dozing off]"
" Interesting twist on a Western, just not fully executed.
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,4,"Definitely different from most run of the mill revenge Western, but too many lagging parts. Majority of the movie is the 'trip' itself. In addition, one of the characters could give Jar-Jar Blinks a run for the money in needless, annoying talking.Not really horror because there are not any scares or monsters or similar."
" $1.8 million wasted...
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,1,"Bad acting...bad effects...bad bad bad!! I am genuinely surprised that this CF has gotten so many good reviews. Within the first 5 minutes, somebody gets shot, and the squib is a full 5 frames after the gunshot...that's some awful directing right there. Save yourself two hours and avoid this dumpster fire of a film. Just because there's awesome actors in it doesn't mean it's a good movie."
" Sun scorched and occasionally funny, occasionally brutal.
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,7,"Directed with leisurely assurance by S. Craig Zahler (who is also the writer), this very witty, slow-burning western/horror hybrid is compelling viewing, even when very little appears to be happening. The long, talky scenes in the first half of the film work well because the dialogue is very natural and often genuinely amusing, all played by an excellent cast. When anything horrific or brutal occurs, it does so very quickly with barely any lead-up. Blink and you'll miss it. However, as the 132 minute story rolls on, these occurrences move increasingly centre-stage. Getting to that point can arduous at times, however, and things drag from time to time.The locations, stunningly filmed, perfect that balance between beautiful and unforgiving terrain. It is this environment that plays host to some stomach-churning scenes, filmed completely without spectacle, and often without the comfort of incidental music.Can this be compared to 'From Dusk till Dawn (1996)?' In that 'Bone Tomahawk' begins as one kind of film and ends up quite another, yes it can. But in other ways, not so much. Where there was an addictive sensationalist lightness to even the more gruesome moments in Tarantino's film, here all the frivolity is saved for the earlier, character-establishing scenes. There's no joking when the raiders show up. Although you have to wait rather too long to see them, it is worth it.I'm not going to name specific members of the cast because everyone is excellent, and even more than that, there are no stereotypes. Far from it. Here, personality and likability wins out over young, pretty and arrogant. If you do not have believable characters, it is that much harder to get the audience to follow them, much less invest in them. This film may well have benefited from a bit of pruning, but it is nevertheless an immersive experience, which also does something different in its approach to horror."
" Love it or hate it. There is more than meets the eye.
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,8,"It's a slow paced movie for sure, but it doesn't suffer for it. Basically, if you like 2 hour westerns, this is a thing for you. There are many subtleties in this movie that fans of ""the hills have eyes"" will usually not appreciate (reading from the comments)."
" Classic Western/slasher/gore etc etc etc
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,9,"I watched in awe. Great actors ( Kurt Russell was superb as usual) and at over 2 hours it was nonstop action. This should be a cult classic in the near future. 
Highly recommend seeing it but be warned it is gory !!!!!"
" Disturbing for sure
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,7,"We need to talk about the women. I was completely dumbfounded by the troglodite women! Spoiler here! The men of this violent tribe apparently see their female companions as means to an end. At the end of the movie you can see how they are used as human incubators. Lying flat on their backs with amputated arms and legs and stakes driven through their eyes. This image is going to stick with me for a long time... This part of their ideology could have been played out a bit more if you ask me. Missed opportunity there! Same remark for the hills have eyes movies. Overall I thought this one was a bit slow paced. I watched for the horror which didn't really happen till the last part of the film. We only get to see one person getting properly butchered which is too bad for a movie about a cannibalistic tribe. Am I reaching for the stars? I don't think so. After years and years of horror movies I guess I'm just waiting for one that can still shock me. Am I desensitized? Yes, but only in the world of fiction.If you are in the mood for some awkward yet entertaining dialogues alternated by gruesome man-splitting cannibal murder then this is the movie for you."
" Remake bound to happen
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,5,"From its title, over its premise, to its casting, Bone Tomahawk is a movie that heavily relied on coolness, yet in the end, it didn't deliver it enough to make it a movie you'll end up loving. Besides a single awesome trope, there aren't any original specialties about this western, leaving it without that sense of wonder a movie with this type of premise needs to have. That it somehow promises it will have. It's like if Mad Max: Fury Road only had 5% of its weirdness, of its originality. And it seems like it could've been a Fury Road for westerns. Yet the makers didn't have enough creativity or bravery to step on the imagination paddle. Almost like they didn't care to.Only one character doesn't feel like a stereotype, and while the acting is on point for the majority of the time, the generic sentences drown out the unique exchanges just with their sheer numbers. You do end up caring about the outcome, which is why the third act is so disappointing in the end. Other thing that didn't help is that music is missing from the film completely, probably due to the director's inexperience. This is a movie that will surely be remade in 20 to 30 years as it had mass potential but misfired.Only for the hardcore western enthusiasts."
" This is both a Savage Western and a Cannibal Holocaust film.
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,9,"Bone Tomahawk. This film has some usual Western tropes: Indian Sacred Burial Site desecrated, Indians abduct a Deputy Sheriff and a Doctor, The Pursuit.But this is no ordinary Western, the Native-Americans involved are Cannibals. Another Indian describes them as Troglodytes, cave dwelling inbred Cannibals (maybe they earlier abducted members of the Bean Clan).This is both a Savage Western and a Cannibal Holocaust film. People are butchered alive, decapitated, limbs severed. Yet another film to be avoided by the faint-hearted and squeamish. 8.5/10."
" Bad
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,2,I've just watched this film. What on earth happened? How did it get 7/10 and 4 stars on Sky. Crazy. Terrible fight scenes. Odd gore. Bad acting. Bizarre film in general. Don't bother unless you want to be baffled.
" Great twist on a classic genre!
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Bone Tamahawk is a welcomed change of pace in the modern age of ""non-stop"" action. Definitely worth the time to watch. The acting is above average and the story line is developed just enough for this type of movie. You cannot go into this movie thinking western or horror, it's a great blend. Do not listen to the ridiculously low ratings that some critics gave this movie."
" What WAS that???
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,2,"Picked this movie out of a bargain bin, attracted by the fact that it had some good people in it. LOVED Kurt Russell in ""Tombstone"" and being led to think that this was (supposedly) another Western, we were looking forward to it. I mean, they don't make too many Westerns anymore.And they didn't make one this time, either.In fact, we sat through it and by the end, really had no idea exactly WHAT it was that we'd just sat through. Or in my case, WHY I'd sat through it.Kurt Russell will always be Kurt Russell and I think he'll always be good in any character portrayal, as he was here in the role of the Sheriff. In my mind, he will always BE Wyatt Earp, in one of my favorite Westerns. But this movie kind of morphed from Western to Science Fiction to outright blood-and-guts gruesome and hideous Horror. Took some seriously sick minds to come up with some of the gore portrayed in this movie and I actually had to look away several times, although the sound was still horrible!There were a lot of impossibilities in this movie. I did like Matthew Fox's portrayal of an eccentric and rather creepy character, but I'd like to know, first off, what he was thinking by going through his days in a dirty, dusty frontier town dressed in a dapper white suit, and secondly, how he managed to stay so clean ... until he was attacked by those ""creatures,"" that is. Then, a guy wracked with fever because of a gangrenous leg simply could not drag himself through a desert all alone (especially with cannibals lurking about which brings me to wonder why in the world they didn't nab him?? An easy meal if there ever was one! I mean, being crippled and all ...). Then, the lack of outright blubbering hysteria on the part of the captured wife when the Sheriff and ""Chicory"" (loved that name!) were dragged into the cave had me totally baffled! Why she wasn't huddled in the back corner in a tight, quivering ball of terror, scared completely out of her mind, just escaped me! Instead, when she saw them, she seemed very calm and almost bored as she immediately greeted the Sheriff. Amazing! A braver, stronger and more even-keeled little gal than me, that's for sure! And again, she was still so clean!My husband didn't say much but I found the one critique he did have hilarious: ""You know, hacking a guy in half just wouldn't happen that 'cleanly.' There'd be all kinds of internal stuff to deal with and he wouldn't just pull apart like that.."" No. He probably wouldn't.And I still can't figure out what the crippled pregnant women really had to do with anything.We both agreed that the movie was ""really awful"" and we felt let down because that group of actors deserved a better movie. There are lots of people who like lots of gore and if that's the case, they're gonna LOVE this movie. But for those of us who still appreciate actual Westerns and have seen these actors in much better roles, we both found ourselves actually wishing we hadn't watched it. It was horrible and haunting and nothing like we were hoping it would be."
" Greatness
",2018-04-12 00:00:00,10,"Amazing western horror. So many good things about this film. Kurt Russell is king, but his supporting cast is near perfect. Just watch and enjoy. A bit of a slow but enjoyable burn torwards an explosive ending."
" Unexpected
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,6,"Tension and suspense was great, liked the splicing of a western/ horror. The end was a lot more gruesome then expected."
" Smart men don't get married
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,7,"This is an odd ""western"" which is more like a 19th century, ""These Hills Have Eyes."" An outlaw disturbs a sacred site of a group of isolated cannibal Native Americans. This brings trouble to the town of Bight Hope which results in a rescue party attempt into the home of the ""Troglodyte"" cave dwellers who would ""rape and eat their own mothers.""This is a slightly different plot for a western, however it is just a different setting for a horror/slasher film without much horror. The film starts off by capturing your interest. It builds character, then slows, then hits you again. Then if drags (literally as one guy has a broken leg) as we spend too much time of our rescue group going after the cannibals.Guide: sex and brief nudity."
" Tarantino without chatter is still pretty empty
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,5,"After watching ""Bone Tomahawk"" and the more recent ""Brawl in Cell Block 99"" back-to-back, I have come to the conclusion that S. Craig Zahler's films are like Quentin Tarantino's output, minus the chatter. This would seem to be a good thing, but this absence of boring dialogue actually serves to illustrate its purpose: it provides the illusion of content. Zahler's films are baggy and empty and tedious, but unlike Tarantino's, they don't occupy you for most of their runtime. From Tarantino, you turn away exhausted. From Zahler, you turn away, merely bored.Zahler is like Tarantino in other ways. For one thing, his films bring in a tonne of capable actors and character actors. Incredibly, ""Bone Tomahawk"" was Zahler's first movie in the director's chair, and yet the cast is amazing. There's Kurt Russell (also a Tarantino fave), Sid Haig (an even bigger Tarantino fave), David Arquette, Sean Young, Richard Jenkins, Michael Par√®, Fred Melamed (you know the face, if not the name). But most impressive of all: the legendary character actor, in his eighties here, and appearing in what will probably be his last ever role... James Tolkan. Not even Tarantino could get him! (Maybe Tolkan thinks he's a slacker? Doubtful).None of these fine and recognizable actors were really necessary, I don't think. This is hardly an actor's picture; they seem dwarfed by the sets and locations and too-long run time, which, weirdly, is the exact same length as ""Brawl in Cell Block 99"". Did Zahler do that on purpose?It feels like nothing happens for the majority of both of these movies. They're uninvolving and fail to generate any tension or interest. This is a brutal horror movie/western, but it doesn't even try to be scary or suspenseful. Again, like ""Brawl"", there are some fairly violent moments early in the movie to whet the appetite for the extraordinary gore you get at the end. We're talking scalpings, decapitations, and longitudinal bisection. (In ""Brawl"", it was mostly head-stompings leading to face and head-loss).That is, essentially, what Zahler's two movies are about: violence. So why does he make us wait so long to witness it?"
" Yawn
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,1,I think it was someone on ScreenJunkies who recommended this but yeah; I wish I never watched it. Simply because it is a below average film. The director and budget are to blame. It is not even worth watching just for the action. The Blu-Ray cover is more entertaining than the actual film. This is a three point seven kind of deal but I'm giving it a one out of ten because it cost me 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.
" Poor taste
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,2,"Bone Tomahawk is a western/horror with a good cast. Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, surely can't miss, well it sure did.Most of the flick's these three actors and an annoying Richard Jenkins walking. Kurt Russell's pretty non-existent even though he's in the whole film. The story's poor and in poor taste, it's just gore for gore's sake. Surprised these class actors got involved in this level of trash. Will try not to watch any more films by S.Zahler."
" Bone Tomahawk substitutes traditional western genre tropes for plenty of gore.
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,7,"Now y'all know westerns are my least favourite type of film. I find them slow, monotonous, boring and unmemorable. They just don't appeal to me. Suffice to say, I am pleasantly surprised by this. A drifter desecrates an ancient burial ground that belongs to a cannibalistic tribe. Captured by the local sheriff, a young woman is abducted in the crossfire and it's up to some residents to rescue her. We've got horses aplenty. Desolate wasteland landscapes. Enough facial hair and hats to supply a drag cabaret show. And...we have a scene where a guy is stripped, scalped and ferociously sliced in half. What. The. Actual. Flip? I loved the third act. Adored it even. It felt fresh, exciting and packed full of grit. The practical makeup effects were flawless, looked incredibly natural. So realistic and extreme, that I squirmed not once, not twice but thrice! The sheer brutality and gore is something you would find in a Tarantino flick. I found the acting to be rather good actually. Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson held the film together, but the stand out was Richard Jenkins who I didn't even recognise. Fantastic makeup. Matthew Fox also delivered a good performance. The characters themselves were not always interesting or captivating, but their interactions with each other felt authentic. The occasional banter assists in the surprising comedic undertone within the screenplay. A noteworthy directorial debut from Zahler. However, as with all westerns in my opinion, the pace is like a rollercoaster. A ten second kill is followed by ten minutes of wandering the wilderness. A one minute stand off is followed by a ten minute camping story. Exciting, boring, compelling, uninteresting. It might just be me and my dislike towards these films, but the first two acts couldn't escape the inconsistent pacing that is all too typical from westerns. Having said that, Bone Tomahawk is intelligent in its execution. The bloody third act alone saves this from being forgettable."
" This is probably the best Western since Unforgiven. *Spoilery*
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,8,"This movie has flaws, no doubt. But it has a very good true western feel for about 3/4 of the film and then takes a hard left into very scary horror territory. The cast is great! Matthew, Kurt and Patrick look amazing! The stand out for me though is the script. I don't know that it is exactly historically accurate but the cast doesn't sound like they're fresh out of 2015 either. See it if you like westerns and horror. Also see it if you like Westerns but hide your eyes for the last act if you don't like horror."
" Apocolypto meets the west
",2018-02-15 00:00:00,8,"Fresh off the heals of The Hateful Eight, Kurt Russell is right back in the saddle again, and this is exactly where we want him. This pic, I happened to catch the other night, only first learning of it's existence a few weeks before, exceeded my expectations as in the quality of the picture from it's photography to it's great script. With a great cast actors who never drop their guard, the spot on casting was one of the prime things I liked about this refreshing surprise of a western, while being overly entertaining and absorbing in a great and carefully structured and told tale, of a group of townsfolk riders, primarily the law, taking up the quota, minus one for a concerned party (Wilson, who we don't see enough in film) retrieve some townsfolk, which includes Wilson's hot wife, who we saw beautifully bare in a nice fornicating scene earlier in the peace, for which we audience, are truly grateful. They are believed to have been taken by a savage merciless group, of tribal Indian folk, but a shocking spin on this, is that they are cannibalistic sons of bitches. You can easily tell in this film, that a lot of gore was cut, right from the opening neck slitting reel. Russell as the sheriff, is a much more sober, and softer type of character to what he was in Hateful 8, although he displays some small characteristics. Jenkins is absolutely terrific, doing his best work, as Russell's older lawful compadre, but it's Matthew Fox as a slightly sleazy and smug deputy, who once tried to get fresh with Wilson's wife, that steals your interest. Fox's small filmography over thirty years is criminal, if you consider how great an actor, this guy is (this is the same clean cut, moustached chief superviser who bought it in Smokin' Aces) while Wilson as the determined husband, determined to get the love of his life back, again never drops guard. Bone Tomahawk is a fresh and highly entertaining western, with some pretty heavy shock violence, mostly near the end, with solid acting to boot, but probably the finale music score could of been a little better applied. Other than that, steer up for another high riding adventure, with a much more sympathetic and civilized posse, other than those cold 8."
" Don't believe any of the good reviews just listen to the bad ones
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,1,"Because they are right, this is one of the worst movies, I'm actually half way through this movie while its playing on tv and got so bored that I came here to find out how on earth it got more than 2 stars lol, But then I checked out who directed the movie and then it all made sense . He is the worst director I've ever seen, His parents must have a lot of money or contacts in the industry to be able to pull these sort of high profile actors. His other movie Brawl in cellbock 99 is just as bad if not worse and he some how managed to get Vince Vaughn to play the lead roll. So someone is funding these absolute pieces of garbage cause I can't imagine any studio doing it."
" Slow ""western"" ends with gore - ends up a wasste of time
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,3,"Really REALLY slow western that ends in gore to make up for the slow moving story.There's a vague story line t hat doesn't even explain why the cannibals come into the town let alone into the jail to kidnap the two people that the sheriff and his posse go out to find. There are also two vague incidents while on the hunt for the cannibals between a seemingly friendly Mexican couple, who get killed by Fox, and then an attack on Fox that doesn't seem to wake anyone up...In the end the cannibals actually find the posse and to make it somewhat exciting, there's a ritual of a lot of gore that is in part, hacking a body in half by way of doing it between the legs and then pulling...and then some other gore...All in all, the ratings on IMDB are WAY too high for this movie. I think some of these ratings are written by people involved with this movie or people that get paid to write them.In the end, I was disappointed and, I don't say this very often, but a waste of time and film and the actor's abilities. LAME movie."
" Amateur approach to a promising idea
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,5,"The Old West...cannibals....cowboys....damsel in distress....posse of various characters. The plot here is an interesting one, with genuine possibilities of something special, something different. But oh dear, the directing is right out of the Ed Wood School of Film-making. The talented Kurt Russell is totally wasted, and the beautiful Lili Simmons is completely under-used. Richard Jenkins manages to deliver the better dialogue but the rest of the cast are, sadly, in the hands of someone who looks as if he's never seen a film in his life. I can't imagine there was a storyboard or considerable production-planning. 
There is so much scope for real suspense throughout the search for the missing townsfolk, but the director uses nothing to suggest tension or fear.
He needs to watch films from the 40s and 50s, and learn how to involve the audience more. 
The landscapes are attractive but the cameraman uses little creative or artistic skills in the remainder of the film. So sad, because the premise is a really good one. I just wish someone with real skills had taken the helm: we would have a much better film, I believe."
" OOH!, This was dreary!
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,2,"Kurt Russell is a great actor.
I cannot believe that he read the whole of this puerile script before saying ""Yes"" to it.
It started off reasonably well with Russell playing his role well.
I thought that it would be a good, interesting change to the normal western/horror drivel that we mostly get.
But, it began to drag its feet, then got slower and ultimately boring.
It just went nowhere, they basically ran out of script and the film ended suddenly and left me with the feeling that I had wasted my evening entirely.
I cannot remember being so bored and disappointed in a long time.
Money down the drain.
Don't waste your time on this garbage."
" That's not the usual western we are used to but certainly worth a watch.
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,7,"I've always been a fan of westerns. There are some really good ones as there are some bad ones. When I saw this one was going to be a mix of western and horror I was naturally intrigued. The story in the beginning is starting slow and that lasts for a big part of the movie. Slow but certainly not bad. The cast is perfect for this movie. All actors bring something special to the movie. I was really enjoying this western and was kinda wondering where the horror parts were that I read about. But they did show up at the end and it was sometimes really gore. My wife had to look away a couple of times. I loved it. It certainly brings this movie to another level. The ending was full of suspense and some disgusting passages but this made the movie special. I would recommend this movie to people that like westerns and horror movies. It's different, but in a good way."
" Classic Kurt Russell
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,8,"Perhaps not his best outing ever, as I don't think anything can top his Tombstone endeavor, but really enjoyed this one much more than the Hateful Eight! Thought it was kind of a new twist on the Western genre, and I didn't know quite what to expect!! Had friends over for Thanksgiving and have to admit I was glad I held off watching it, as I enjoyed watching it with friends who enjoy the Western genre. We all enjoyed Kurt Russell and his supporting cast in this adventure, as we didn't know what to expect or where the story was going to take us. Seems like when Kurt Russell pins that badge on in a Western he was made for that role and rises to the occasion!! Thumbs UP, will watch this one again sometime soon!"
" Great Horror Western, If Bloody
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,8,"When I saw Sid Haig, I nearly didn't watch, and was glad his character was killed in the first few minutes. This one is brutal, folks, so be prepared for serious carnage. If I didn't know Eli Roth didn't direct this film, I'd take it for granted that he did. Still, it's a Western, and the 19th century jargon really makes it."
" Expertly Written yet Disturbingly Gory
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,8,"Bone Tomahawk is a steady mix of Western and Horror smooshed together seamlessly. It has all the usual Western tropes, albeit reduced to their simplest and most realistic, but also adds in significant enough moments of gore and cannibalism to stick with you long after the film has ended. It's certainly not a film for the mainstream, which is probably why it coasted under the radar upon its release. It's a slow burn that takes the time to find humour, charm, and entertainment in the mundane. It's first act puts you right into late 1800s frontier America for the everyday civilian. Cowboys are literally just guys who heard cows, Sheriffs keep peace in a quiet town, bartenders struggle for custom, doctors tend to the sick and injured, and ex-military keep to themselves harbouring their own inner demons. Life is quiet and peaceful inside the town, but wild and dangerous outside.The film opens with a guy's throat being sliced open, but not in the typical Hollywood fashion of a quick cut and blood spurting everywhere. It's like slicing through meat and bone. This pretty much sets the tone of the whole movie. It prefers gritty realism to anything else, without glamourising anything, and also doesn't shy away from it's more graphic moments. When someone is brutally murdered, they're really, brutally murdered. Slicing, stabbing, guts and blood. Bone Tomahawk is not for the squeamish or faint of heart.But the realism also extends to frontier life. I've already mentioned how it portrays a quiet town in the off-season, and the every day civilians who inhabit it, but each character who gets focus is built in such a way that they're not just characters; they're believable personalities with backstorys, desires, and varying degrees of intelligence. The use of vocabulary alone not only transports us back to those times, but also speaks volumes to each character and their motivations.The acting is top-notch across the board. Kurt Russell is Kurt Russell. He just oozes screen presence just by being there, and his Sheriff is both smart and patient, with his heart in the right place, and an awareness for those around him that makes him both intuitive as a Sheriff and empathic to his fellow men, no questions asked. His back-up deputy is played by Richard Jenkins with a gentle naivety that's hard not to love. He's old and chatty, but isn't too smart. Yet Jenkins manages to breathe such life into him that he never feels like the joke of the film, even though he's by far the most humorous character. Patrick Wilson's cowboy Arthur is the everyman of the group, and his broken leg throughout puts him in a unique position not often seen in movies. He's in pain almost perpetually, and the only thing that keeps him going is his determination to rescue his wife. He's heroic in the least heroic way, with no grand feats, limited by his injury, and relying entirely on his smarts to outwit the cannibals.Honestly, for me though, Matthew Fox's Brooder is probably the most engaging and interesting character. He's ex-military with a chip on his shoulder brought on by a tragic backstory that's never made a big deal of. For all intents and purposes, he should be the unlikable dick, but instead Fox gives him a charm and worldliness that makes him oddly likable. He never drifts into antagonism despite often holding views and attitudes in opposition to the other three, and while his pride and vanity would make him unpleasant company, they instead give him an edge that puts him at odds with everyone else. Matthew Fox really can act, and do it really well. He offers a better performance than his more esteemed co-stars, and that says a lot considering the company.Bone Tomahawk also excels in it's more technical aspects as well. Sound design is extremely good, emphasising every moment, no matter how quiet, disturbing, or mundane. When a knife cuts into flesh, you can hear the piercing, the slicing, and bone grinding that takes place. When the wilderness is quiet, the subtle ambiance of birds and breeze gently caresses the background. The lack of a musical score (for the most part) gives these exceptional demonstrations of sound design a chance to be their own thing, and adds all kinds of suspense and intensity to moments that would otherwise be cheapened by music. When someone is suddenly hit with an arrow, phwomph. The unpredictability brought on by the lack of music adds so much.Bone Tomahawk was a wonderful surprise. I'm not sure I'm in a rush to watch it again, not because of that death scene, but because the second act felt like it dragged maybe a little too long. There's only so long watching a guy limping in pain in the wilderness is entertaining. However, at the very moment I started to feel bored, it changed direction and kicked it up a notch. I give Bone Tomahawk a solid 8/10 for it's fantastic writing, well-executed horror, and acting performances of a lifetime. Would recommend, at least once."
" A Gem of Its Genre
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,8,"Horror and sci-fi can be overlapping sub-genres, and ""Bone Tomahawk"" seems an example of both. Outwardly, the film has a classic Western plot. Set in the 1890s in the southwestern part of the United States, it is about a sheriff and the posse he forms to track down a band of kidnappers and rescue their hostages, necessitating pursuit on horseback across seemingly endless plains. The horror/sci-fi twist is that the kidnappers, though nominally Native Americans, are a nameless, pasty-faced clan of mute cannibals who are cave-dwelling, barely human monsters. Other Native Americans fear them, describing them as ""inbreeds who rape and eat their own mothers."" (Also, they communicate by means of an eerie howling sound that is due to a primitive implant. In some ways, they are reminiscent of the Borg from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" or, even more, the less orderly, marauding Reavers from ""Firefly"".)The Professor (Zahn McClarnon) who refuses to join the posse calls the clan ""troglodytes,"" a term that suggests a throwback. But they seem not to be a throwback to anything that ever actually existed. This clan of ""troglodytes"" rather seems to have opted out of humanity by collective choice, and perhaps they eat people precisely because they do not see themselves as people.The creation of the Trogs seems to be speculative anthropology. Whether such an outcast population might have existed after the official close of the frontier might strain credulity, but it is always claimed by advocates for the existence of hidden monsters that they are right under our complacently civilized noses.The captives include a murder suspect named Purvis (David Arquette), Sheriff's Deputy Nick (Evan Jonigkeit), and frontier medicine woman Samantha O'Dwyer (Lili Simmons), who is treating Purvis for a bullet wound and fever when the mysterious clan of Native Americans raids the local jail in the middle of the night. The posse consists of Sheriff Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell); his ""back-up"" deputy, ""Chicory"" Kory (Richard Jenkins); Samantha's husband, Arthur O'Dwyer (Patrick Wilson); and egotistical adventurer John Brooder (Matthew Fox).Samantha O'Dwyer is not a shrinking victim but the town's fallback when the regular medical doctor is unavailable (drunk as usual). She is sharp and competent, and her medicine kit holds items that come in handy as the story progresses.Chicory is a man who is too old to be a regular deputy, but Sheriff Hunt respects his expertise as a Civil War veteran who has experience fighting, treating wounded, and just being observant. His great fault is that he talks way too much. Arthur, the husband of kidnapped Samantha, is a would-be cattle drive foreman, side-lined after he broke his leg in a DIY roofing mishap. He is an unassuming cowboy, a devout Catholic, who loves his wife deeply. (There is a funny, tender scene in which he reads out loud a letter he wrote to his wife that she rightly calls poetic, but when he stops reading he scoffs that it isn't poetic at all.)Arthur is not really well enough for the journey, and although he proves to be an asset, at first his broken leg seems obviously a hindrance and even a danger to the posse and its mission. Indeed, I can't understand why the sheriff agrees to let Arthur join the posse rather than locking him in jail for his own safety. Of course, one reason for taking him along is that too few other townspeople offer to join the posse. The posse consists of only four. There is no back-up plan. A telegram is sent only to ask for two deputies from another town to come and temporarily take over police duties while the sheriff is away.Director S. Craig Zahler seems to be making a career of authoring (writing and directing) good B movies with sharp images and amusing dialog. (Instead of telling Chicory to ""shut up"", Sheriff Hunt asks him whether he can ""close that aperture"".) Zahler also gives work to good actors who have been misused or underused in Hollywood. Here we have Kurt Russell showing perfect savvy and grit as the sheriff, and Matthew Fox as the egotistical gunslinger who describes himself as purely rational but who hates Native Americans and loves his horse with equally unreasoning passion, and Richard Jenkins as the colorful Chicory. (More recently, Zahler has given Vince Vaughn a strong starring role in ""Brawl in Cell Block 99"".)""Bone Tomahawk"" is not for the weak of stomach. What the cannibals do to their victims is gruesome. In one horrific scene the production undoubtedly spent a large chunk of the special effects budget to show a human being butchered by the Trogs."
" A good, not great, horror western
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,7,"When some towns folk are kidnapped by a tribe of cave dwelling cannibals, sheriff Kurt Russell teams up with Patrick Wilson, Richard Jenkins and Matthew Fox to rescue them. Their opponents are far savager than they could of imagined. A decent slow-burning western that descends into madness and gore in an unbelievably downbeat climax. I liked this film, but didn't love it for some reason ... even though I have to say it's soundly in my wheel house. It kind of left me wondering what the point of it had been."
" Not that good as everyone is saying (a short review)
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,5,"So most of the people are saying that its not slow but just building characters well they all are blind as moments of character development is minimum and all we get for the first hour is filled with normal stuff that people do. It feels like that they didn't have anything to make the movie longer as the plot itself is like 3-4 pages long stretched for more than 2 hours. Not much happens throughout and neither are the cave dwellers who at least should be intimidating are any good as at the end they switch their button to go from stupid to completely stupid. Only good about this film is their performances and how the movie was shot from western standards. In all its just fine at best, could have been a lot interesting.Verdict: you may skip."
" Brilliant trailer, disappointing movie.
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,3,"This could have been a great movie and I sadly suspect there was a great movie left on the cutting room floor. I felt opportunities were missed all over the place. The characters Chicory(Richard Jenkins), Purvis (David Arquette) and Brooder (Mathhew fox) were criminally under utilized and may have been effectively edited out of the movie, even the Sheriff(Kurt Russell) was marginalized as the film progressed. Arthur (Patrick Wilson) was good here but should not have become the central character and got far too much screen time.Samantha (Lili Simmons) was a 'Quinn Medicine Woman' type character in a time when there simply were no Quinn Medicine woman type characters and her face and perfect teeth just didn't fit this movie.The troglodytes were one dimensional and I suspect there was a missing rape scene (probably edited out) that would have given us more sympathy for the kidnapped and would have explained why Samantha was still being kept alive too.The costumes and sets were excellent, but the troglodytes cave was laughably cheap. Other reviewers have highlighted the dialogue ....All I am going to say is that the writers/producers of this movie clearly love Quentin Tarantino. There are strong hints of 'Dusk Til Dawn' and 'the Hateful 8' about this movie....thats not necessarily a bad thing, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and all that, but the problem here is its not soo much a homage but more like good old fashion plagiarism.The language is completely incongruous with late 1800's where even lowly cowpokes know what a troglodyte is ...seriously, I had to look it up !!!!Trailer was one of the best I have ever seen, but film itself was poorly edited and ultimately unsatisfying."
" Is this a film?
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,1,"I thought it was just some irrelevant random rubbish. I didn't care for any of the characters, I was bored to tears, and I resented the filmmakers for trying to sell utter boredom as a kind of moody, slow-paced character exploration and build-up of suspense. It was just awful. Kurt Russel is great, but he doesn't get to do anything really. He's just being Kurt Russel, though in a sedated version, with no memorable lines. He also kind of sucks during action scenes - which are very few, and boring (and confusing) like the rest of the film. Why is this thing over two hours long? And why was it even made? Who read this script and thought it would be exciting?"
" With ""Bone Tomahawk"", Zahler creates a whole new sub-genre with great success.
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,10,"Bone Tomahawk may be classified as a ""western gore-horror"" - probably the first of its kind, although the superficial plot - four cowboys going on a quest against cannibal Native Americans - is entertaining and original enough, the film is much more than that. The casting is remarkable, especially with Kurt Russell and Matthew Fox; the costume design and the setting does not fall short than the casting. Yet, what makes this movie a critical success is the fusion between the characters and the carefully crafted dialogue. The clever dialogue goes hand in hand with the slow-paced story of the film and enables it to reach to the climax with the action-packed last twenty minutes. The amount of gore in the film is set just right, finding that thin line between over-exaggeration and incompetence. As both a huge horror and spaghetti western fan, I may say ""Bone Tomahawk"" is one of the most original horror films I've ever seen; Zahler needs to get right back at shooting films!"
" one of the worst films I've seen
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,1,"It was tedious viewing using good actors for a poor story. Did they make this story up on the hoof? The guy in the white suit was a ridiculous character a sorta mysterious doc Holiday type. The cave looks as if it were made of blankets covered in clay and how the hell did the cave cells hold them in with wooden bars somehow secured by wooden pegs pushed in by hand? The nasty Troglatites didn't look very Troglatitish and the damsel in distress still looked fresh as a daisy, I thought it very gentlemanly that the Trogs didn't even grab her by the pussy. Yet despite Kurt getting shot in the stomach he still had the strength to cut off one of the trogs heads with what seems a Jawbone. Couldn't wait to the finish!I think Hollywood is running out of ideas what with this and 'Cowboys and Alien's' at least it had good effects, unlike this one. You have to go as far back as 'Valley of Gwango' for some offbeat and quirky Cowboy story which wasn't bad"
" More than worthwhile
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,8,"As a 60+year-old fan of the Western genre, I give this film accolades for its gritty realism. It is very violent, and, has been mentioned in other user reviews, should not be shown to the younger folks. In recent years, there have been a number of straight-to-video or straight-to-streaming Westerns that have scored highly in dirt-in-the-craw realism but have been sorely lacking in character development. This movie scores in both departments, I feel. Richard Jenkins, in particular, unrecognizable in his role (I had to look up the character here on IMDb to see who the actor was... and was surprised to find it was he), gives us a character worth remembering. Lili Simmons brings to mind Diane Lane in 'Lonesome Dove.' Of course, Kurt Russell delivers as the no-nonsense sheriff who gets more than he bargained for. Worth watching but not for the squeamish."
" Truly Original but brutal and very creepy
",2017-09-21 00:00:00,9,"With Hallowe'en coming up, I thought I'd talk about Bone Tomahawk again. It's a surprisingly good contemporary Western, with clever, witty dialogue and interesting characters, reminiscent at times of the Coen Brothers version of True Grit. It might also be the only successful Western Horror film that I can think of. I may not have given the film its proper due the first time around. As much as I do love Classic Western movies, I don't want to get caught up in that assumption that we don't do anything as well as we did in the old days, as we so often do. One of the greatest Film Noirs in my opinion is Chinatown, which is neither from the time period that we associate with Noir or filmed in Black and White as we assume Noir is defined by. Similarly there have been some superb later era Westerns like Unforgiven or the superb remake of True Grit. There are also modern Westerns that are able to tell the story in more modern ways like Meek's Cutoff, giving us a more modern perspective on women in the West. Not everyone's cup of tea, but a superb film nonetheless. Bone Tomahawk falls into that latter category. The premise, of a small town posse that is forced to go out to rescue kidnapped friends and family from cave dwelling cannibals, makes the film as much a modern Gothic horror movie as it is a Western. Which leads me to a warning: Bone Tomahawk is nauseatingly graphic at times, seeming more like a close relative of Texas Chainsaw Massacre than most what we think of when we think of a Western film. It is raised above the usual fare by its clever heightened dialogue. Lines like ""You're mighty unfriendly for a guy named Buddy."" and humorous exchanges about soup make this a close cousin of superb films like True Grit. And excellent acting, led by Kurt Russell, who I think does not get nearly enough credit for just how fine and actor he really is. And Matthew Fox, of Lost fame, who is also a better actor than he usually gets credit for. It's a smart, though often brutal film, with a very original story and a very original take on the Western. It's also genuinely creepy. You can find it on Netflix if you want to check it out. But be warned. Bone Tomahawk is not for the faint of heart. It is definitely not for the faint of stomach. But is well worth the watch. If for no other reason than its uniqueness and originality. #movies #film #filmcritique #westerns #bonetomahawk"
" A contrasted western
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,8,"The triviality of the dialogues makes the most casual western I could remember so far. The distension with which the people from Bright Hope live the most plausible western I know. In this movie the clich√©s are replaced by the witty humor, by the quiet and unimportant talks that generate custom, that do the daily life. Then, in response to a manifestation of unsuspected violence, the reaction of the community is very reasonable. An armed troop is formed suddenly. A troop of imperfect heroes; very human. The trip is heavy and there is someone who does not shut up. So far so good but this warm western becomes ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and the sense of horror is enormous precisely because of the normality with which the facts had developed. Tension; a lot of tension. Just as westerns lovers could expect from a western. But it is not justice or revenge. Bone Tomahawk reach the tension in an unprecedented way; through terror. The scenes are very horrible but also very brief. Just a brushstroke. A sufficient measure. What a way to suffer! A movie where there is no place for complacency. Demolisher. Unique."
" An awesome western after a very long time with superb locations, good one liners n a dark n brutal showdown.
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,9,"I first saw this in early 2016 on a dvd.
Revisited it recently. I was waiting for a second viewing before writing a review about this good film.Fans of the western genre will definitely enjoy this slow burner. Horror movie fans will love this.
Its very rare to come across a good western horror mash up n this one is amazeballs.This film is not at all boring. The dialogues r good, the character development is brilliant n the acting is top notch.The pacing of the film is well complemented with intelligent and witty humor and highly likable characters n a sense of brooding dread.Debutante director, Zahler did a terrific job considering the budget.
I own the dvd of Asylum Blackout of which he is the writer.Before diving into the brutality n shocking violent confrontation, we r given solid tension, suspense, the ominous loactions n a sense of brooding dread.Much of the film is shot in amazing sun-soaked settings. Some really good work by the cinematographer Benji Bakshi.The director is heavily influenced by classics such as The Searchers n Hills have Eyes.
Lovely to see Kurt Russell in a western movie and that too with a handlebar moustache aft (Tombstone) a long time."
" A gem
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,9,"This movie surprised me. It was nothing like I expected.It starts out with a scary beginning, then slows to a rather mundane pace. There is old west style humor and some oddities but then some things go seriously wrong. People are being murdered and kidnapped. The sheriff feels obligated to go after the criminals but is not sure what he is up against. A friendly native American looks at an arrow that was left behind and tells the sheriff those are people he would NEVER try to find, they are worse than barbaric. But sense of duty motivates the sheriff to ignore the warning and go after the kidnappers. For awhile the movie slows to a snails pace but that is for effect to emphasize the hardship of traveling in a harsh environment. Soon enough the searchers find the kidnappers and quickly come to regret their decision to seek them out. Those people are savage to the core, even worse than the Native American warned them about.I refuse to reveal any more because to do so would ruin the ending for you. I gave this a 9, that should tell you it was very good, I seldom rate anything with a 9."
" Just didn't work for me.
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,3,"I'm not sure if what I'm about to write would be considered a spoiler or not, but consider this a warning.I'll keep this short and sweet, unlike this movie. If it wasn't for the character, Chicory, I'd have given this movie a 1. Chicory's innocent and unintentional humor was the only thing this movie had going for it, in my opinion.It moved so slowly that I almost lost patience and turned it off. I don't mean slow as in ""building suspense"" slow. I mean ""watching Arthur drag his leg, fall down and moan in agony for half of the movie"" slow. We get it. He's miserable and bravely struggling to complete this monumental task. I didn't need to be beat in the head with that fact for an hour.Then, the last 30 minutes. Ugh. The bad guys were a cross between sci-fi and horror movie villains......but so cheesy. The scenes in the cave reminded me of an episode of the 1970's series, ""Land Of The Lost"". Yes. That cheesy. The bad guys use their hands to pound the cell bars into the wall. The good guys can't kick them out. But when the stuff hits the fan, the woman just pulls the bars off like nothing. I usually try not to nit-pick details like that, but this was just so fallacious.The bottom line is that I had high hopes for this movie, but the mixing of the genres didn't work for me. It felt like a very slow, ""B"" movie from the 80s."

",2017-08-07 00:00:00,7,"I am pleasantly surprise with this movie. It was infuriating at first watching the movie but i decided to stay on and was rewarded at the end. The movie runs for 2 hours which is a little too long. It would have been better if it's edited to 1hour 30 minutes. At first i don't know what direction the movie is heading. The script was very out of place, there's lack of music score , there's A list movie stars, it all seems like a very bad Hollywood movie. Just very weird. but the last 20 minutes or so when they reach the cannibal's place , that's where the comedy/ action/horror (whatever you call it) begins. Only then did the movie reveals and explains itself why it was 'intentionally' weirdly written. For a low budget movie, it was very well done, considering it's a first time direction. I wonder it managed to pull in such a strong cast. Watch it with no expectation and an open mind and you'll be rewarded."
" Cop Out Western
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,8,"It's called a Horror Western about a tribe of ""troglodytes"" that kidnap a couple of townsfolk and the posse that goes out to retrieve them.The funny thing is this didn't have to be about a made up tribe of ""troglodytes,"" if you read enough history, journals, and letters of the early frontier and the West you'd know that nothing that went down in this film was very far off from what the Native American tribes actually did to other tribes and to European colonists. I'm actually of the opinion that it could be that the PC powers that be would never greenlight a film that showed Native Americans as they actually were during certain sequences in their history.In recent years especially with films like Dances With Wolves the general impression exuded is that with the Native Americans it was almost (except for the designated ""bad"" tribe, all ""Peace Love Dove"", one with nature like hippies or hobbits, sadly not so.In this film just take away the strange voice calls and call them Iroquois, Ottawa, Hurons, Blackfeet, Sioux, Apache, Comanche, Yaqui, get the idea."
" Are we watching the same film?
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,3,"After reading all of the gushing reviews, I have to ask: Did we see the same movie? I didn't find Bone Tomahawk that good, and thought most of the gore was unnecessary, just kind of thrown in for shock value. The Troglodytes were a pretty unreal mix of Sci-Fi meets Freddy Kruger. Plus the story was just convoluted. (Who steals a woman, then carries her that far away to put her in a wooden cage?) It just didn't work for me. A big disappointment for any real western fans. (How much did the film gross?)"
" Great writing, great entertainment
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,8,"With Bone Tomahawk, talented debuting director S. Craig Zahler, who's also behind the well-written screenplay, delivers true entertainment.It's a rare combination of good screen writing, witty dialogues, nice acting, fine direction, great use of Californian locations and a perfect blend of genres, being not only an atmospheric western and a thrilling horror, but also an exciting adventure with proper doses of drama."
" A big let down **Spoilers**
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,3,"I only watched this film because of the 7.1 scoring on IMDb. This film was such a let down. Great cast with a interesting plot and some good acting, but what a terrible ending. The first 3/4's which was predominantly a western was alright, however the last quarter which was more of a horror film was pretty awful. A couple scenes I couldn't get my head around; Brooder's death was expected at some point, but for such a good gun sling, why did he die so quickly and not really contribute in many killings?! Also in the cave the bore tusk wearing savage roared/screamed but it was unnaturally loud (even with it's throat piece) and made it appear more like an alien. The final scene of the survivors just walking down a mountain was just strange, I was left feeling like I'd missed part of the film with it's sudden ending."
" Not what I expected, way too long, but not bad either
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,6,"The best part of this film was the writing, directing and cinematography.What failed was the editing, sound and I'm sorry to say, the acting. The only decent performance was by Kurt Russell, and even he was stale in certain parts.The pace was VERY slow, and 2 hours and 12 minutes was just ridiculous for this film. Each scene was stretched out to the max, and for what reason? None that I could see. Had this been chopped down to say 90 minutes and had a better score, it would have earned an extra 3 points from me for a 9/10. But sadly due to the misses, it's only a 6/10 from me.It did however earn the points I gave it for only the last 20 minutes that were done very well and had a nice twist to the story."
" Pretty cool neo-spaghetti flavored western
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,7,"Pretty cool neo-spaghetti flavored western. I hesitate to say horror - though it is quite gory at times - because it is firmly within the confines of the western genre and it's tropes.It's a character driven adventure ride with a nasty shootout looming (and more) and for a genre exercise actually takes its time and enjoys the ride. It's a bit sub-Tarantino in that regard, especially with what it thinks is cute characterizations and dialogue (sometimes good, sometimes OK). But these are really good actors working with fleshed out and interesting characters and it knows when to unleash the catharsis. You actually care about these guys and the violence hurts. And it's wrapped in a genre package so it's not taken overly seriously, there's some good humor to be had too.I'm looking forward to more from S Craig Zahler."
" Good Old Fashion Western
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,6,It is all about making atmospheres. It got every character we expect from this Genre. Good acting especially Kurt Russell. Many breathtaking scenes. characters introduced along the flow of the movie. Movie is horror so beware of watching it with a dark theme. the only thing which bother me a little was mediocre predictable ending. Finally I recommend watching this movie. It is a good movie in its' mixed Genre.
" A very solid ""B"" level Western. Would I buy a Bluray copy? No. But I did purchase this movie from a discount $5 bin and it was indeed worth it.
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,5,"This movie, at least to my mind, is akin to Quentin Tarantino pictures yet with a low budget and with more linear clarity. Banal and pastiche to start before finally breaking off into a vigorous maniacal flurry.""Bone Tomahawk"" is one of the better Western genre movies to come out in recent times. While that isn't exactly a high bar to reach it proves impressive nonetheless considering the shoestring budget. It does have that Western ""feel,"" with a bit of a sci-fi horror aura grafted in for the second half, only with the antagonists being troglodytes instead of aliens. Move summary:A turn of the 20th century small western town - containing the usual stereotypical presence of rakish looking men who comport themselves in ways indicating they don't quite trust each other - is suddenly hit with the realization that people are disappearing. Later on some disturbing evidence is found, the local native recites an old legend, and when further calamity strikes the townsfolk pull together in an effort to find out just what exactly is going on. What they discover is more terrifying than they could of possibly imagined.Despite the budget, it's a quality movie. I would like to know how they pulled it off at only an estimated $1.8 million dollars, did the actors work for minimum wage?"
" Beowulf on Horses
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,7,"Despite the rather sedate pace and relative lack of action, as others have said, the acting makes this movie really flow. The characters are not simply types - the director works hard to give them a hair of background and more than just a surface personality. While the female lead is very much the traditional ""damsel in distress"", she has a strength to her that is trusted by the townsfolk she serves.Issue #1 - the dialogue between some characters seems very clipped and overly formal, the kind of language that works well in a novel but sounds forced on-screen. I have the same issue with True Grit (the more recent one). However, assuming this is intended as a close reflection of how people spoke in those days (rather than letting them simply speak like us, now), it is what it is.Issue #2 - calling the story ""original"". Folks, it's Beowulf on horses. Yes, there are some interesting elements that I haven't seen used with this story before, but on the whole, if you've seen Beowulf or The 13th Warrior, you'll twig to a lot of plot elements fairly early.This being said, the movie was worth a watch, even if only once. Kurt Russell is excellent, but Richard Jenkins absolutely steals the whole show. If you've only ever seen him as smarmy business-types, you need to watch him really stretch here (or lose his mind in Cabin In The Woods - just sayin'!)"
" Surprisingly Good Film. Interesting Story.
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,7,This film crept up on me. I am going out of my way to write a review and a rarely do. This is a not only a good western but a good film. The acting is realistic. I won't call this a horror in the Nightmare on Elmstreet sense. Think THE MISSING or Western suspense. You don't have to like Westerns to enjoy this.
" A lesson in script-writing
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,2,"This film is unintentionally hilarious. The script is just so-o-o bad - one feels sorry for the actors. I thought that lesson number 1 is that less is more. You don't need the Hellos and Goodbyes that pad out every scene. I know, by showing a normal, mundane life you make the horror that follows more horrific yet but the earlier, excruciatingly long, wooden scenes of stilted dialogue back at the ranch add nothing other than embarrassment to the actors' faces. The posse camps at night and we expect a cannibal attack at any moment and the deputy requests advice from the sheriff on how to read a book in the bath without getting it wet! And the scene drags on... and on... just too funny. At half the length, this would have been a good horror short. Interesting idea, good cinematography but..."
" Passable western/horror film. Needs more substance and less scenery
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,6,"A marshall (Kurt Russell), his deputy (Richard Jenkins), a doctor, and a gunslinger set off to rescue two people who have been abducted by a tribe of cannibalistic mountain men.Like Russell's beard, Bone Tomahawk in is dire need of a trim. Here is a movie that is comprised not so much of scenes, but of space between the scenes; a lot of dead air in the wilderness. Curiously, there are times when this works to the films advantage. In an era where movies (both indie and Hollywood) feel like they are getting shorter, the sight of a Kurosawa paced movie has a way of drawing you in. All around, the acting style is appreciably realistic in a historically mannered way. The problem is that the closer the characters get towards conflict and peril, their levels of composure become increasingly hard to swallow. With his mix of geriatric wisdom and whim, Richard Jenkins is the standout performance in the movie.After an overlong trek across a barren frontier landscape, we climax in the lions den. The last scenes, which take place in a cave that is clearly a film set, are flat and anticlimactic. To be sure, the mountain men are genuine creeps. The movie neglects to show that they have domesticated horses, which begs a curious question. Why, if they are cannibals, do they live way up in the mountains where civilized food is a long walk from home.Bone Tomahawk deserves credit for merging western and horror without depending on gimmicks from either genre. In between the long spaces there are some moments of creepiness and competent writing, but the running time is criminally overlong."
" There is a lot of different kinds of Horror, and this is a new one.
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,9,"It's like if True Grit turned into Cannibal Holocaust in the third act. Pretty effective conceit, actually. The weakness of your typical trail Western is the third act and character resolutions ... and boy does this movie come up with a novel way to short circuit that problem. It's a horror movie, so, grading on an appropriate curve, this is pretty great."
" Bone Tomahawk
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,7,"What a pleasant surprise ~ finally a western with a horror theme! The acting is very good: Russell is great, and the supporting characters are well-casted. Overall, it's gritty, really 'western', and the dialogue is well done. Ending is surprising. A very enjoyable '7' and a sleeper, in my books."
" An Absolute Waste of Time!!!
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,1,"Awful! Awful! Awful! What a waste of time! Kept waiting for the story to get interesting, but it never did. I was so bored by the end, even the climax was predictable and uninteresting. Please look elsewhere for western entertainment. How this movie can average 7 stars is beyond me. Just terrible!"
" Unapologetically gruesome, authentic horror
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,10,This came up suggested to me on Netflix last night and I really like Kurt Russell (who doesn't' right?) and Patrick Wilson from the Insidious films and of course The Conjuring so I gave it a go. I certainly wasn't disappointed. I had heard it was very long that there was a very long set up etc but that didn't discourage me. Simply put it is fantastic which is rare to say of a Hollywood horror film these days. Highly suspenseful and gut wrenching stuff! It's worth every bit of the prolonged set up. I've seen hundreds of horror movies all my life and I found the gore in this borderline unwatchable. If you are a horror fan this is a MUST SEE film! Easily the best horror film Kurt Russell has done since John Carpenter's The Thing in 1982. This film is darker than The Thing though I would say. The film is dripping in foreboding tension and atmosphere. Very long but so worth it. Don't miss this classic horror film!
" Unique Western horror hindered by the running time
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,7,"'Bone Tomahawk' is a rare mix of the Western and horror genres that, for the most part, works really well. The first half of the film is generally low key and slow moving as we get to know the characters and plot, with the second half containing most of the horror elements, including some very graphic violence.My only issue with 'Bone Tomahawk' is it's running length, which to me felt unnecessarily long. There are parts in the middle of the film that contribute nothing to the plot and could have easily been cut down. Two and a half hour films aren't that rare these days, but I felt the long running time contributed nothing to this film. In fact, it probably hindered it.Overall, 'Bone Tomahawk' is an original and very well-made blend of the Western/horror genres. It's enjoyable as it is, but a more sensible running length and I would probably liked it even more."
" Great stuff
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,9,"Wasn't aware of Zahler before but will be checking out everything he has done and eagerly awaiting his next.10 out of 10 for me, loved every aspect of this great movie. Brilliant acting Brilliant Sets Brilliant Costumes Brilliant Script Just Brilliant!"
" Surprisingly good
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,7,"When I stumbled on this movie on late night TV I was not sure what to expect. But it had a respectable cast and so I persisted. The folks acting in this clearly knew how to act.The thing that really drew me in though was the dialogue spoken, the language used characters drawn. It is here that I noticed some similarities to other recent classic westerns that really got into the character of the Old West. ""Open Range"", ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""True Grit"" (the Coen Brothers version) all come to mind. That version of True Grit is one of my favorite movies of all time largely due to its verisimilitude and the Coen Brothers attention to detail and respect for the original story. Comparing this to that movie is therefore meant as a badge of merit.These are all movies where there is little to accommodate post modern sensibilities. And the language used, the morality displayed and customs depicted are all much as I understand them to have been in that 1870s era. All movies are about the willing suspension of disbelief. This is even more true with horror movies and the like. And nothing spoils the mood so much as the tendency found in too many modern movies to have the characters all look and sound as if they are walking the streets of Los Angeles in 2010 (but in cowboy clothes). This film has its characters use language, dress, behave and express views that adhere to the mores of an earlier time - duty, perseverance in the face of adversity, sacrifice and other late Victorian ideas of what it is to be a good and honorable man.Undoubtedly the movie has some flaws. I will let you find them yourself as I don't think they are of such magnitude as to damage the story too much. But parts of the movie are surprisingly scary too. And while that is what the movie is ostensibly about, I have to say it is its ability to evoke old-time values that really won me over. I am not usually too much into horror movies (too often they are only horrible in a bad way - script, story, acting, paper-mache monsters etc) But this is not one of those, it is instead made in a really craftsman-like way that held my interest and engagement to the ending scenes."
" Gritty western/horror hybrid really delivers the goods
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,10,"BOME TOMAHAWK is a really good western/horror movie that features exemplary direction from an unknown director and great performances from the small cast. It terms of plot it's nothing special, a 19th century reworking of THE HILLS HAVE EYES, but it's the execution that makes this such a great movie. Despite a two and a quarter hour running time the film is hugely suspenseful and soaked in a gritty, disturbing atmosphere.I'd heard reports of this being a gore fest but it's no such thing; there are a handful of brutal moments but mainly this is a mood piece. The descent into a kind of hell is reminiscent of the likes of APOCALYPSE NOW and CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and the every scene is carefully composed to add maximum depth and tension. The desert landscapes look fantastic, and the violence is all the more impactful for being used sparingly.Cast-wise, Kurt Russell headlines the show and is quite brilliant, as usual; it's nice to see him being used properly after his turn in the lacklustre HATEFUL EIGHT (and boy, Tarantino could sure learn a thing or two from this film). Patrick Wilson does his dedicated everyman performance and is likable with it, and Matthew Fox is a real surprise as the brash and arrogant fellow who gets you on side regardless. Richard Jenkins, as the old timer, somehow keeps the whole thing together. As with the recent MAGNIFICENT SEVEN remake, BONE TOMAHAWK breathes new life into the almost forgotten western genre, making it worthy once more. I can't wait to watch it again."
" Impressive Western With Horror Elements
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Kurt Russell ? Whatever happened to him. He was a fixture in cinema releases from the 1980s and early 1990s then seemed to disappear quite quickly from the scene. His stardom was probably down to the fact that he could play edgy anti-heroes in stuff like THE THING or good ole American boys in films like BACKDRAFT. He was definitely much more versatile than action heroes from the 80s like Sly and Arnie and after seeing THE HATEFUL EIGHT I'd forgotten how good Russell was back in the day. Mentioning Tarantino's movie I came in to BONE TOMAHAWK, a film described as cross genre involving horror set against a Western background, I thought I might be watching a post modernist mess full of smart alec dialogue and nodding self referential winks to the camera. Thankfully this is not what I got Just before I started watching I came on to the box office and business subsection of this page to find it cost $1.8 million. This is a sum that wouldn't get a big name star in Hollywood to answer a bedside phone-call never mind appear in a movie and yet director/screenwriter S Craig Zahler has made a film that riveted me far more than the average blockbuster which costs 50 times more than this one did. This is even more surprising because I dislike Westerns and can take or leave horror movies and yet the fusion here impressed me greatly The reason BONE TOMAHAWK works so well is because it starts off so very low key and languid and the pace , tension and horror is slowly ratcheted up. It's similar in many ways to APOCALYPSE NOW that started off as a macho war film then ended up being a psychedelic expressionist horror film set in another dimension. Now to be fair BONE TOMAHAWK is in no way visually stunning compared to the Coppola masterwork. Instead it's if not realist type cinema then undeniably independent cinema composed for the most part of four men riding through a Western landscape. Admittedly there's almost zero horror element until the final third but that's the whole point of the film and when the horror does happen there's more than enough violence to satisfy the most blood thirsty gore hound Interestingly another cross genre horror film that has come out recently was the British production UNDER THE SHADOW set during the Iran Iraq war of the 1980s. Structure wise it shares a structural similarity with this where the drama is the focus and the horror elements are held back to the end and one wonders if up and coming producers might wish to use this technique more often ? I also wonder why producers are spending 100 million dollars on movies that are very mediocre to say the least. BONE TOMAHAWK thankfully bucks this trend"
" Western adventure.
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,10,"This film was recommended to me - I hadn't heard of it and knew nothing about it. What an astonishing surprise. This is the best film I've seen in a decade. The script and dialogue are first- class. The performances are deft, supremely focused and perfectly pitched. The music is evocative and suspenseful and, at times, very beautiful. The Western movie is a long-established and occasionally hackneyed genre but this film has an entirely plausible feel while also having a quotidian strangeness to it. That it was produced on such a small budget is further proof that this is not only a masterpiece, but a major cinematic achievement."
" A complete waste of time
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,1,"This ""western"" has stilted dialogue -- can't imagine anyone in the real Old West speaking such drivel. And the plot is totally unrealistic -- four men ride out to take on zombies. Where were the rest of the townspeople? What reputable sheriff leaves a prisoner unguarded? This was a disgusting movie, a complete waste of time. Glad I saw it on-line and didn't have to buy a ticket!"
" Excellent genre-mix
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,8,"An excellent mix of genres and a strong cast. The suspense is well crafted, the dialogue is crisp and the horror elements are superbly interwoven.A fine example that good entertainment doesn't necessarily hinge on a big budget.I wonder why this gem has gone so unnoticed."
" First Class
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,9,"Much has already been written and there is little I can add to the superlatives other than simply, this is one terrific movie which at times takes your breath away. IMO, up there (almost) with 'Unforgiven'. The cast have nailed it and there is not one duff player among them. The writing and direction is tight and this has to rank in the top 5 westerns. See it, it's great."
" slower horror western with brutal violence
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,7,"Purvis (David Arquette) and Buddy (Sid Haig) are bandits killing and robbing in the old west. They stumble upon a native site and Buddy is killed by a warrior. Purvis escapes to the town of Bright Hope. Sheriff Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell) confronts and wounds him. The town is attacked in the dead of night and people go missing. The locals suspect a clan of cannibalistic native cave-dwellers. Hunt leads John Brooder (Matthew Fox), hobbled Arthur O'Dwyer (Patrick Wilson) looking for his taken wife Samantha (Lili Simmons), and deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins) as a posse of four.The start is a very intriguing horror western. Then it turns into a slower paced affair. The intensity is lowered but it maintains the interest. The characters are good played by compelling actors. There are some brutal violence although sometimes the camera cuts before the coup de gras. With some of the crazy violence, it's weird that the film does the old fashion look-away. The last act is unforgettable."
" Slow Paced, Dark Western
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,7,"When i heard about this movie, i tought it would be a action-packed B- Movie with a lot of fun. Instead i got a dark, pretty realistic western with a simple story. Bone Tomahawk is one of those movies that shines with it's characters. After the wife of a crippled man, played by Patrick Wilson, is kidnapped by wild cannibals, a couple of men are going on a rescue mission to save her. The four men can't be more different and that's what drives the movie. The movie is slow and if you're looking for fast paced entertainment or great moments, you are probably having a hard time with it. If you like stories about a group of people in an extrem situation, you're right. Don't expect too much, but for a nice evening with no expectations, this movie serves very well."
" Disapoiting

You, IMDb, should have some vote on it, not just allow crazy people to rate and that's it. At the end it is your reputation. This movie is a 3, maximum 3.00000000001. I rated it as 1 to put down the current medium. Yeap, it is a 3. Anyway, if you are reading this review, I'm being your friend... PLEASE DO NOT WATCH IT!!!! Regards"
" not a great movie
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,2,"This movie is so bad. I mean the actors are lacking mimics, they don't know how to play and how to show their emotions. The cuts are so long and boring. And you could barely understand something until half of the movie. Also you can only mention Patrick Wilson and Kurt Russell for a decent play. The scenery and the set are quite OK for a western. You don't have to much human interaction. There are also some plot holes. How did that deputy helper, managed to operate Arthur and in the next day he's foot was as new. And also how did Arthur knew that the thing from their throat was making that noise and that he will need it? I don't know what to say about this movie."
" The Best Western/Horror Film i've Ever seen.
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"I had added this a while ago to my list but had put it off until a friend recommended I watch it so I pushed it up my list. Think Western Revenge/Rescue posse meets Cannibal Holocaust. It starts off a little slow and stilted, feeling almost play-like in it's manner of delivery and at first I was like oh no, this isn't going to be too good. But then the story ramps up and Kurt Russel enters the film and from that point on there is nothing dull or under-delivered. The violence starts off a little over the top but more hinted at or slightly shown, but by the last 3rd it is insane, cringing, screaming out kind of violence while never loosing site of the story, it's characters or the pacing. Nothing breaks you out of the film either, no moment was so far out there you went yeah right. This is a film done very, very well."
" Rare entry in the western/horror genre ... and a good one
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,7,"The plot of ""Bone Tomahawk"" is deceptively slight: terror hits a small western US township when two residents go missing, apparently kidnapped by cannibal natives. A posse of four men go out to save the day, with mixed results. Yet that synopsis hardly does the movie justice as, unusually for horror movies at least, the characters are well-rounded and the acting is almost uniformly excellent.Some may find the gorier scenes on display hard to take, but seasoned horror movie viewers will see nothing more shocking than they've seen many times before. The key differences here are that the viewer cares about the main characters, understands their motivations, and can see the logic in their actions. If only all horror movies had these qualities.The pedestrian pace may irk a few viewers, though the main criticism is the rather anti-climatic ending. The cannibals show little inclination to avoid gunfire, and after a brief skirmish the action, and the movie, peter out. This is gripe aside, few lovers of either genre will be truly disappointed by ""Bone Tomahawk""."
" Too long for too little story (mild spoiler)
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,3,"This story could have been told in less time. Two hours and fifteen minutes was simply too darn long for a story that wasn't all that complicated. A solid half hour could have been trimmed without losing a scene. How? Well...The problem is that everyone moves in slow motion. Characters walk from point A to point B as if asleep. Heck even the horses seem to be on sedatives. When we do finally get to the point of it all we, too, are sedated to the point that the films vaunted ""extreme gore"" is a bore (only one scene of brutality and all some critics talked about is the gore. They must not get out much!).The dialog was not all that great either. Stilted. Lethargic. Lili Simmons (Samantha) has the best line in the entire movie. See the Quotes section.After all is said and done we are left with a Non-Ending. Truly insult to injury.Very good seasoned actors all; so I place the blame on the director for not giving this tale the pace it required; or the tension it deserved. He also wrote it so I blame him for the dreadful ending as well."
" Not For The Faint of Heart
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,5,"There's a lot of great, interesting, methodical & entertaining character development for well over the first hour of the movie, but then, takes a 'hard-right-turn-at-Albuquerque', and into a completely different genre (altogether).On a personal level, Kurt Russell has been a favorite & all time top 5 actors, which frankly, was the primer for previewing the movie in the first place, {well that, and being a sucker for the western genre}.The approximate 45 minute epilogue, is an exceptionally brutal & disturbing portion of film, and for those not particularly fond of the horror-gore genre, w scenes that arguably, could be, - 'kissing first-cousins, to'Texas Chain Saw Massacre', - then be prepared for certain imagery, to take root & ingrain itself indefinitely (in the mind's eye).At the very least, it's quiet perplexing that, the producers, opted not to better prepare the audience, for 'double-dipping' genres, especially the migration from western to horror-gore."
" A weird thrill ride
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,7,"Saw this, finally, and I was intrigued but also impressed...and yet a bit disappointed, by the time the film ended. It is a mix of a classic Western, a buddy movie (or, rather, a movie about dynamics of a small group), a kind of a slowly unfolding disaster movie, and a horror film, with a 'creature feature' aspect to it. The acting I found to be solid. The characters were somewhat developed but kind of left half-finished. The sheriff's and his posse journeying into the eventual lair of cannibalistic cave dwellers is well depicted; there's tension, as well as entertainment. It does drag on too long. The cannibal troglydotes are freaky - but quite unbelievable. The viewer doesn't learn anything about them or their origins expect for the fact they're damn good at killing, butchering and eating humans (and maybe a few other animals). And, of course, the good guys win, overpowering and outsmarting the cave-dwelling baddies. So, let's talk about the cave-dwelling baddies. Are they some strange clan of white settlers gone totally astray? Are they a forgotten and ostracized sub-tribe of Native Americans? Are they mutants or aliens? Not much of a hint here. I would have preferred even a short backstory about them. As some other viewer has remarked, if this is the 1890s, why are the man-eaters not cleverly using guns instead of spears, bone tomahawks and clubs? Why are they so Neanderthal instead of maybe being simple inbred rednecks who munch on the occasional fellow Wild West traveler? (Here, I am thinking IF there were cannibals on the American frontier then, they would have resembled the bad rednecks from 'Deliverance' rather than some creature from 40,000 years ago). Anyhow, the director tried to make a mash up of two or three genres and produced a kind of a cult film. I like my Westerns straight-up and I like horror movies like 'Alien' where it's more of a reptilian or some completely non-human creature, so it didn't appeal to me on that level. It did appeal to me as a journey film and as a statement on how far people are willing to go. Kurt Russell is continuously appearing in movies these days, being basically Kurt Russell- wouldn't it be great to be him?"
" Excellent actors, screenplay and dialogue
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"This film differs from a conventional western because of the costumes they wear not quite like the westerns of the fifties, and also the unusual scary, primitive savages. Also you must have a strong stomach to see all the gory scenes. But what makes this film above average is in the excellent choice of actors , dialogue and screenplay, which starts reminding one of ""The Searchers"" but with completely different characters. Kurt Russel as the sheriff, Patrick Wilson as Arthur, Richard Jenkins as Chicory and specially Matthew Fox as Brooder are excellent, including Lili Simmons as Samantha adding beauty and class to her role."
" An excellent blend of two beloved genres
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"S. Craig Zahler's Bone Tomahawk is a generally obscure 2015 Western-Horror film. Yes, really. Western horror. It is truly a strange mix but Bone Tomahawk manages to be an excellent western film as well as excellent horror film, making this genre-jumper immensely entertaining and surprisingly smart. You would never expect anything like Bone Tomahawk to get made, but after viewing, you will want more.Bone Tomahawk features a talented, but somewhat B-list, cast with Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson being the film's most recognizable frontrunners. Every actor involved here, however obscure, does a fantastic job. There was a constant sense of realism and honesty in every performance, making the entire film all the more involving. The main 4 characters that we follow throughout have great chemistry and share some interesting dialogue. While all playing cowboys, they each manage to generate their own distinct personalities and traits creating a strange, yet entertaining, chemistry between them all.Bone Tomahawk is a film that is almost guaranteed to stick with you for a while after viewing. Whether this is due to the horrific violence or it's quick changeup of genre, it is certainly an impressively audacious debut film from director Zahler. But it succeeds in it's goal of creating a unique mix of genres so well that the idea never comes off as irresponsible, but rather genuinely impressive. The film's subject matter was handled so well that even it's most bombastic ideas and aspects felt surprisingly mature. Our director seems to indulge in the extremely graphic and disturbing violence but never to the point where it feels unnecessary. It's surprisingly well handled and smart with it's subject matter when it could've easily been silly and juvenile. It's not quite enough to say that Bone Tomahawk is just underrated as the high quality and smart narrative make it a truly great film as well as under appreciated. The visceral scenes of action and violence adds to the unwavering sense of tension and unpredictability as we progress through the brilliantly unique and twisted story. Expertly crafted, relentlessly intense and full of character, Bone Tomahawk is a truly impressive debut feature from director Craig Zahler, whom I have high expectations for in the future as his obvious confidence behind the camera is much needed trait that many modern filmmakers lack."
