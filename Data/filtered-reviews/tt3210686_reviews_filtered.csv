" Movie was good
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,10,"Unlike the ""Passion of Christ"" it wasn't too graphic but done well"
" Don't forget.
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,10,"Emotions are too great. I recommend it to everyone who loves God or at least doubts him. Maybe it will clear your mind and help you find the right path. The path that will lead you through life. It also teaches you many lessons, and rules to follow if you expect someone to reciprocate. At the end of the film, if you feel great pain, it means that you still have hope and faith in God. So many memories and so many things to remember. It can change your view of the world. To forgive is for a man, everyone deserves a second chance. Don't forget Jesus still loves you. Amen. <3"
" The box office sins are forgiven
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,After being such a successful series . Fox did a fantastic job making it into a film for many people to see in theaters.
" MOST OF THE SCENES ARE OUT OF THE BIBLE
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,1,"I don't like this Cast for Jesus ... He doesn't look graceful Enough ... the world calls him ""Hot Jesus"" .... and most of the stories are out of the context ... they took this to gain money not to spread good news so I will give 0 ..."
" This is a poorly done version of Jesus' story
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,2,"I will not repeat the criticisms that others have made, but I have to say, that during the sufferings of Jesus, his crucifixion, and the unthinkable sorrow of His mother having to witness the torture of her Son, I forgot that the actress in the role of Mary was miscast, and the man in the role of Jesus was too handsome and healthy looking to be a wandering peasant Jewish rabbi, and let the tears come at the horror and humanity.of those two human beings, Jesus' horrible suffering and death and Mary holding His broken body while, sorrowing, John, gently removes the crown of thorns,
It is very hard to witness such cruelty even in a film."
" Loved it!!
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,10,"I really like the fact that Roma Downey and her husband decided to make this while filming The Bible. It was perfect for someone who is working through Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, which Im in the process of doing. Though all four of these books of the bible are the same story, there are some slight differences and I thought this movie did a wonderful job of using all four of them, even though the narrator was John.
I love seeing Jesus portrayed. I am a visual person, so I learn so much better seeing the bible in documentary or movie form. And I really enjoyed Diogo Morgado's depiction of Jesus. He caught the deep humility and sadness well, though I wish you could have done rage better (in the scene where he topples the tables at the temple).
If you want to watch a movie about Jesus' life and death, but don't want to be absolutely horrified by the violence, I think this is a good movie to watch."
" Still Worth Watching
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,8,"Diego Morgado stars in this film about Jesus entitled,""Son Of God"". In it,we get to witness a collection of episode from the mini-series ""The Bible"". The first hour features the different events during the public life of Jesus. The second hour presents the passion,death and resurrection of the Lord.The first hour was definitely a missed opportunity. Too bad that one would notice the flawed continuity as the film was basically a contraction of events from several episodes. Too bad that it affected the pacing of the film. The second hour made up for it as we get to see a better part in presenting Jesus' death on the cross. Despite the fact that there are many inaccuracies in telling the story as told by many reviewers, we witnessed a better presentation particularly when Jesus was condemned by Pontius Pilate to death. It was obviously a political thriller that one would enjoy.While it may not be the best film about Jesus,I think that one would still find enjoyment in it. Seeing another film about our Lord and savior would always be beneficial for any Christian as a reminder of his death and suffering for our salvation."
" Diogo Morgado was superb as Jesus
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,9,"Diogo Morgado was superb as Jesus, humbly trying to carry out God's will. His divine light and compassion kept shining through, drawing the people to Him. The whole story was told in a simple, clear manner that was easy to understand. The music and photography were beautiful as well. The only quibble is the Marxist Politically Correct insertion of an African ""wise man"" and an African carrying Christ's cross for Him. There is absolutely zero evidence for either of these. Zero. First, the man who carried the cross was Simon from Cyrene, a city populated by Jews and majority Greeks, until the Jews revolted and massacred all the Greeks. Simon is a Greek & Hebrew name. He was not African.Secondly, the ""African Balthazar"" myth was invented in the 8th century AD by the English monk Bede. His bizarre proclamation was ignored until it suddenly popped up again centuries later. So 800 years after the birth of Christ, one English monk decided to add a bit of ""extra diversity"" to the New Testament, and this complete fabrication was solidified in the popular mind about 700 years later. Can we stop feebly going along with this fraud, and depict the Three Kings ""FROM THE EAST"" as the Gospel of Matthew says? In the 6th century, they were depicted as Persian, which makes more sense, doesn't it?"
" Very inaccurate
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,3,"For those of you that know what the bible says about Jesus, This is a very inaccurate account of his life. I would suggest that you watch Jesus of Nazareth. It is more accurate than this movie. I did think that, although it wasn't very accurate, it was a fairly good movie to watch even if you don't agree with me. I would rate it a 3. Also not a very good movie to try and teach Jesus to little children."
" Copypaste
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,1,This movie only catch the episodes of Jesus un TV series The Bible and put them in a movie
" An Honest Review
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,1,"OK, this might be bias in comparison...but not for the back and forth that you're reading in most of the reviews.Unless something is BLATANTLY political to the point that it irritates me for reasons of propaganda...I try to slam BOTH sides in these reviews.I don't really feel that I have to here because the film is about Jesus and coming out the door we already know that people are going to be insanely pro-Religion or adopt that anti-religious stance that borders on pathology.So, instead we're going to go right to the review and state flatly that there are better movies about Jesus that you can watch.The Last Temptation of Christ is, of course, top on that list. This is seconded by Jesus Christ Superstar. And, in both cases, even if you are a fundamentalist Christian or have such a phobia against religion that you feel compelled to hate everything on principal...you should be able to agree that those are two stellar films on purely dramatic and cinematic basis.Son of God really isn't...at all. It tries very hard to be as faithful to the Jesus story as it can and still be a dramatization...but because of that it falls short on the ""drama"" department.It comes across feeling sort of stale and I'm not entirely sure how it can recover.The people involved in Son of God did do some things right, ""The Bible"" was compelling...but it was delivered in short segments that worked as little stand alone stories and made the entire series really very watchable and enjoyable.You can't really do that here, and they failed when they adopted The New Testament a few years later.I suppose the best way to review it would be to say that is has a lack of emotional focus. The depiction of Jesus is almost void of a real dynamic personality and because of that the only real dramatic value is situational and that doesn't work with the way that the film is laid out.If you are looking for films about Jesus, there are far better options...but those options are significantly less accurate. But, I'm of the view that if you want accuracy, read about it.If you want entertainment, on the other hand, sit on the couch and watch the show. But not this one, Son of God falls short on entertainment."
" Amazing Movie
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,10,"This Movie made me feel....Alive, amazing, astonishing, astounding, surprising, stunning, staggering, shocking, startling, stupefying, breathtaking. It was the Best movie ever made about Christ. This is great and shows the story of the man the legend, Jesus Christ. If you want to see it, go ahead I encourage you, its epic."
" Awful
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,1,An awful with very poor acting! I wasted my time watching this movie!
" IT'S JESUS!...AND NO ROCK CREATURES!
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"The film starts with some narration by John, whose gospel introduces the concept of the ""logos"" or ""The Word"" and equates this Greek theological idea to Jesus . It places Jesus with God the father from the beginning of time.It jumps to a quick Matthew version of his birth and then to collecting apostles, making his first miracle being a human fish finder. Yes the Lord God creator and all being of time, space and dimension must stick his face into the water to locate fish. My LOL moment.The movie introduces historical background, but does so briefly. The famous Sermon on the Mount, what I consider to be the inspirational center piece of Christianity is not used, save for The Lord's Prayer. Even ""Life of Brian"" did that aspect better...""Blessed are the cheese makers...""The film nicely modernizes the King James version, even with the actors having varying accents. The film attempts to follow the story through the Gospel of John, which may be why they cut the sermon on the mount, but then they added other aspects that were not in John, but Matthew.The production makes Jesus look like a cult leader with a rock star following. The last hour which concentrates on the Passion of Christ, I couldn't help but compare it mentally to the far superior Mel Gibson production. Indeed, in many ways this film isn't any better than some low budget church productions.I liked the idea of opening with John. If they had made this film based strictly on the Gospel of John, they could of had a first. The story assumes we know the characters and never builds or develops them. The plot has wholes in it, like what was Pontius Pilate supposed to do with his wife's dream she considered a warning? Say, ""Okay Jesus off you go then."" Wouldn't that screw up everyone's salvation?On the plus side Jesus Christ handled hecklers better than Chris Christie, but then, who doesn't? The film takes some dramatic liberties utilizing long ""William Shatner like"" pauses before Jesus says a line we know is coming. The scene of Judas ""returning"" the 30 pieces of silver, was nothing like what I imagined, my bad I guess.I really loved the rock star Jesus for the first 30-45 minutes of the film. But the second half felt like they changed Jesus and not for the better."
" Jesus is a boring character.
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,3,"It's like watching a robot your supposed to feel bad for. He speaks with long pauses like he's some dramatic, pretentious being. The Bible didn't show him this way... He's not funny, likable, or anything. He's always sad and dramatic and ""deep."" How did jesus in this movie get anyone to follow him? He was so boring."
" Too dramatic
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,5,"I am a fan of movies about Christ and like to see how the various takes on his life go. I grew up on 1977's Jesus of Nazareth, and saw 1961's King of Kings through TV airings and DVD. Unsurprisingly, they were pretty dramatic.Then comes 2014's Son of God, which I found too dramatic.What is the difference between 2014's take and the earlier depictions? For the latter, you feel the message of Christ and the New Testament, very powerful in my opinion. For Son of God, I felt they were trying to cater to a ""modern"" audience. While I didn't think the acting was bad, I didn't feel the Gospel in this depiction. While I also thought there were some good additions or takes (like expanding the role of Mary Magdalene), I thought they dramatized too much some events from Jesus' time.If you are an atheist or agnostic, this can be an enjoyable fare for you. If you become a believer afterwards, more power to you.If you are a believer in Christ and into his teachings and regularly worship him, I'm not so sure you will feel the message of the New Testament and Christ in this movie.I for one could not feel the message. Again, too dramatic for me.See it and form an opinion for yourself."
" They tried...but it didn't work
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,4,"I am disappointed in this film. I only made it through 37 minutes before shutting it off. I (reasonably) enjoyed The Bible miniseries and had high hopes for this movie, but they took way too much liberty with it. I understand about wanting to make it more in line with what his life may have been like and making Him more relatable to us, but this was too much liberty. They added words, and actions and just made it disappointing. Honestly, I'm surprised we sell it at the Christian store I work at."
" Missed so many important messages of Christ
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,5,"Please, you make a film about Jesus Christ, and you omit in the Last Supper--- THE moment where Jesus talks about the new and ever lasting covenant of his BLOOD that was shed for your SINS. You leave out the part where he says Make disciples, teaching everything I have commanded, BAPTIZING in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Jesus does not go into the tomb and kiss Lazarus, he calls him out! He does not tell Peter Before dawn you will deny me 3 times....He said before the rooster crows you will deny me three times...What's wrong with using the words Christ actually said? Too boring? This movie tells lies...I had to double check my Bible several times because I knew dialogue was miss quoted...So many errors....too sad....and the most important message: If anyone will come after me, you must DENY yourself pick up your cross and follow me. And you want me to get excited about this movie? Then again you have fake Joel Osteen, fake Rick Warren, fake Delia Reese,commenting on how wonderful this movie is? Thank God he chastised me to read my Bible so I don't get duped. Being a Christian is not saying some little prayer and crying when you listen to some Christian song in a concert or in church, it is DENYING YOURSELF---- you are giving up everything, all worldly wants (Joel Osteen, listen up!) needs and your desires, and give it all to God and let HIM have his will and way with you, ""Christian""!-----Not a very rosy, lovely-dovely, petals in the wind message uh?"
" A Good Re-Telling Of The Jesus Story (If Lacking In ""Passion"")
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"In 2004, Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" was a landmark film in its unflinching look at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. ""Son of God"" operates in a similar vein, while also focusing on more of the ministry of Christ before his death and resurrection. The difference between the two? This is a four-star solid film, while ""Passion"" is five stars because it was first and because it had a little more ""passion"" (pardon the pun) behind it.For a basic plot summary, ""Son of God"" is pretty much a straight re-telling of the Jesus story. After a brief prologue about the Old Testament and Christ's birth, it begins with Jesus (Diogo Morgado) meeting his disciples as they are struggling to catch fish in the Sea of Galilee. The ""walking on water"" scene quickly commences and the film is off and running. It doesn't touch on every aspect of Jesus's ministry, but certain key moments are rendering in fantastic dramatic detail. About half way through the film, it shifts gears and becomes a crucifixion/resurrection story, beginning with the involvement of Pontius Pilate (Greg Hicks).""Son of God"" is not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. It is a faithful re-telling of the Jesus story...as simple as that. Due to the success of ""The Bible"" miniseries on television, the show producers wanted to get something up on the big screen. Considering the short time frame they had to work with, I would say they did a fine job of putting together the film.The reason it will always be second fiddle (at least to me) to ""Passion"", though, is because of two main reasons (in this case I won't even fault ""Son of God"" for being second, even though that does have at least some impact): First, in ""Passion"", Gibson quite literally poured his entire life into that project. That kind of energy and effort showed up in the final product. With ""Son of God"", one can tell that even though the cast/crew/producers were trying, the effort was not to make a masterpiece. Secondly, Jim Caviezel was just flat out a better Jesus than Morgado. Like Gibson, Caviezel lived his role and set and (until recently with the success of ""Person of Interest"") was practically known as Jesus in the film industry!So, while ""Son of God"" was a solid Jesus story flick, it will probably always play second-fiddle to ""Passion of the Christ"" for some of the reasons I listed above. I don't see it as a problem that the Jesus story is re-told every 10 years or so in a new dramatic setting, but looking at things purely from a movie-critic perspective it just doesn't quite measure up to Gibson's 2004 piece."
