" Great movie, low reviews are from Gen Z.
",2021-04-12 00:00:00,10,"If you do not find this movie interesting at all, you have no taste in anything, really.That being said, the bad reviews on this title are from kids who prefer to watch prank videos on YouTube and classic remakes which feature horrible actors that are rated 9+V/H/S series is number 1, not debatable, a 10/10 series."
" Forgettable AF
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,2,"This movie has nothing to offer, with cheap visuals and CGI, along with some awful acting. This is a movie you might wanna skip in the VHS franchise."
" Only one of the V/H/S is good , the rest of the movie has no sense and is awful
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,5,"Only the story of the multiverse(second story) can hold a 5 for this movie because the rest of the movie all above the borderline have no sense , because isn't V/H/S , is a awful found footage."
" Suck
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,2,"The first movie was awesome, but the second and this one..waste of time..i expected more but..it was so disappointing"
" My FAVORITE of the three...
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,10,"I'm not going to write a long review and go in-depth about the film, I just want to say that this one is my FAVORITE of the three. I mean, I loved the sequel up until I watched this one. The segment that I believe is called 'Bonestorm' is my favorite next to 'Parallel Monsters'. I'm also fond of 'Gorgeous Vortex', even though it's a bonus and not part of the film. I wish it was, however. I don't get the complaints over this film though, at least it isn't like 'Creepshow 3' (now that was a STINKER). Anyway, after watching this numerous times. I highly recommend this film."
" Jeez people, it wasn't THAT bad
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,6,"I don't quite understand why everyone says this movie was so bad. Was it as good as the first 2? No, but if anybody actually thought it would be, as the 3rd in the series, then they have seriously unrealistic expectations. It was still a decent little anthology, and miles better than some of the other movies with similar ratings. Worth a watch."
" How I wish I had read reviews first
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,2,Don't waste your time. It's like a super random Black Mirror episode without a cohesive message. Seriously. Avoid this trash.
" Nowhere Near The First Two
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,3,"I'll keep this brief and to the point. Like the others this is a collection of filmed horror short stories. But this time there is an over arching story tying them together, and it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. I finished the film not even 5 minutes ago and I don't have a clue what happened. One of the shorts in this film is actually really interesting and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The rest are either mediocre or outright stupid. They went on too long or were poorly made and acted out. The CGI in the whole film was bad. The acting was mostly bad. Some of the special effects were pretty good, but the cinematography almost killed me. Zoomed in, POV, shaking violently type of bad. I'll give it 3 stars for the 1 good short in the film. Might be worth a watch if you loved the first two, but don't get your hopes up."
" Laughable garbage
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,1,"I went into this film with high hope, but god almighty it's painful to watch. The acting is terrible, the effects are sci-fi channel tier, the story is cring inducing. If I had to choose between watching this or an Amy Schumer special, I think I would punch myself in the testicles.lll"
" Watcable...
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,3,"""V/H/S Viral"" is a Thriller - Horror movie and the third movie of the ""V/H/S"" saga, in which we watch a car chase by Los Angeles police along with some other stories from VHS tapes.Since I had already watched the previous two ""V/H/S"" movies I had very low expectations from this movie. This is not the best movie you could watch but also it is not the worst. At least this ""V/H/S"" movie has a connection between the stories and it is not some random stories combined poorly just to make a movie as they were the two previous movies. It is a watchable horror movie nothing more, do not have high expectations from this movie and you won't be disappointed. If you have not watched the previous two movies then do not make the mistake to watch this, it does not worth your time."
" Warning: Not as good as the first two
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,1,"Don't waste your time. Seemed like they tried too hard this time around. I honestly liked the first two and thought they were genuinely creepy, but this one was far from that. I couldn't even finish it and the parts I did watch were so lame that I just had to laugh. Super disappointed!!"
" Nothing good about this movie
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,1,"I cannot imagine why this was one. The main plot is confusing as hell and the stories inbetween are just boring. The only good thing about this movies is that you know the stories are short, so this doesn't seem as bad as it really is. The parallel universe was absolutely the worst, but that doesn't mean the rest is any better, they are just a bit less boring. I actually like V/H/S and the very first story is my absolute favorite. This one you shouldn't watch. Thank god I watched it free on tv, if I had paid to see this, I would be furious."
" You tried. Thrice. Now it's time to stop...
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,5,"First segment, ""Dante the Great"": some loser magician finds an enchanted cape and turns basically into God. But the cape is hungry! Out of all the stories from all three V/H/S movies, this is probably the one I enjoyed the most. Mostly because it's the one that doesn't belong. Vote 7. Second segment, ""Parallel Monsters"": man meets self from another reality, swap lives for 15 minutes, immediately regrets his decision. Very good one, ruined by the giant demonic penises. Yeah. Vote 6,5. Third segment, ""Bonestorm"": the most annoying piece of short cinema I've ever encountered. I don't want to talk about it. Vote 3. Average vote 5.5, decreased to 5 because of Bonestorm. Now please, don't make more V/H/S movies. Pretty please."
" Not horror, just silly
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,2,This movie looks like it was made by some skate boarding kids on drugs for other skate boarding kids on drugs. It was like a lame acid trip.
" vhs viral
",2019-08-27 00:00:00,1,This movie is somehow even more boring then first and it is also unintersting as all three of this franchise
" Meh...
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,4,This has nothing on the far superior 1st and 2nd installments. It lacks the grittiness that the first two delivered and is laughable at times. The worst is the central wraparound story. There are a couple interesting segments but for the most part the movie is forgettable.
" Bad.
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,3,"The worst movie of the trilogy. The first two movies were for me, one of the coolest horror movies I've ever seen, and a few years later, looking forward to the release of the third, they come to me with this planet bug."
" Pretty much pointless...
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,3,"Granted, I can't really claim to have been much of a fan of the past movies as a whole. Sure, there were parts of the previous ""V/H/S"" movies that were interesting, but as a wholesome movie package, not so much.I was given the chance to watch ""V/H/S Viral"" in 2019, and I hadn't even heard about it before now. So that just goes to prove the impact of the franchise, or not huh? Well, I said yes to sit down and watch ""V/H/S Viral"" having sort of an idea of what I was getting myself into here.Again it is an anthology of stories that are tied together by a narrative as well, much akin to the previous movies. However, while following the same manuscript and how-to-make-an-anthology recipe, then ""V/H/S Viral"" just didn't have as much appeal as the previous movies, especially the second movie in the franchise.This seemed like a scramble of different stories put together, certainly, but there was little given to the audience in terms of building up the characters or setting the scene, so it was straight into the stories and action, for better or worse. It didn't really work out all that great, because the characters were essentially pointless and shallow, offering nothing to the audience to relate to.The different segments were of very varied quality and interest, but overall just landed well below a mediocre value. In fact, the entire stew of this movie just was dragged down by a pointless narrative and equally pointless characters. Plus the fact that there was nothing scary here at all, well, maybe except for the super annoying added layer of broken VHS quality, which really was getting on my nerves towards the end.Stay well clear of the 2014 ""V/H/S Viral"", because it really isn't worth the time or effort."
" Highly imaginative, surreal, high-energy sequel
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,8,"If you're sick of average horror, try this. I guess the other reviewers were expecting something tepid and inconsistent like the first two VHS films, which are good but forgettable. This film, like it or not, is unforgettable if you actually watch it, and I suppose I sort-of understand why people who enjoy the first two VHS films would be confused by this one because the first two films are like 'Night Gallery': pretty good, basically average TV-movie horror stuff, and I've seen both films twice but can't remember a single episode from either of them.VHS Viral, compared to the first two, is more like 'Re-Animator' because it is insanity on steroids, starting with the guy obsessed with the ambulance, which is the framework for the other stories. My favorite parts were the magicians fighting over a teleporting cape, and the skateboarders. I think a lot of people hated the skateboarding segment, but I loved how it just said 'screw it' to conventional filmmaking ideas and managed to establish something that was really like an actual found-footage thing with these guys being stalked by a bunch of weirdos who might not be just wearing costumes. The 'portal door' segment is pretty shocking. I'm amazed that there are SO many bad reviews for this film; I think it just hasn't found its audience, because those who would enjoy it probably didn't like the first two films all that much.If you're looking for something crazy, dark and funny, and you're ok with films which are as much about the bizarre experience as the narrative (like if you enjoyed 'Mother' with Jennifer Lawrence), try VHS Viral."
" YOUR ONE OF US
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,6,"VHS as I recalled was people watching a VHS tape and then they would disappear. In this one the VHS tape is all but gone, although the bad tracking and lines associated with VHS are still there in digital cameras. The film consists of several disjointed episodes of which the Magician segment seems to be the favorite. I know it was mine, it wasn't a hand held camera. It consists of a magician with a magic cape that consumes humans, similar to what the VHS tape would do. There is a group of skate boarders who get in trouble with Mexican zombies. A man creates a portal to a parallel universe and trades places with himself. The main episode which starts and finishes the film as well as pops up from time time, consists of rescue vehicles circling through the city which has Kevin's (Patrick Lawrie) girlfriend Iris (Emilia Ares Zoryanand). He wants her back and chases on bicycle.The episodes by themselves weren't bad, but overall the story lacked cohesiveness.F-bombs, nudity, creature sex?"
" A Shame!
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,2,"You won't find a single character in this film to be likeable. Not one segment illuminates even one endearing personality. It's terrible to say that, but it's true. We're happy to watch everyone die and that's no way to navigate the course of a motion picture. We want to be attached to someone in a movie. We want to invest in something. it makes for a different connection, adds a certain intimacy to the experience. V/H/S: Viral isn't intimate, it isn't entertaining, it isn't thrilling in any way, and it definitely isn't a picture that should have ever been assembled. It's a shame, because Gregg Bishop and Marcel Sarmiento are two awesome filmmakers who pick up big respect from me. This just didn't happen to be the proper outlet for either to shine."
" V/H/S
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,10,"Waiting on V/H/S 4 to come out. 
Anybody else with me?"
" Disappointing after the first two
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,4,"If you have seen the first two, then the third will probably be a let-down. V/H/S Viral follows the same anthology premise as the first two but the stories don't flow as easily. ""Vicious Circles"" was the most confusing for me. ""Dante the Great"" was one of the best. ""Bonestorm"" visually great but not the best story. ""Parallel Monsters"" had potential but went a bit overboard wtf.It seems in the third they tried to push the creativity and it didn't work, not for me anyway. The cast is a solid as the previous installments but the stories aren't as easy to grasp and at the end you're kinda wondering what the hell went on. I thoroughly enjoyed V/H/S/ 1 and 2 and was excited for the third, but it lost something this time around. Unfortunately it wasn't good enough for me to want to buy the DVD for the surprise ""Gorgeous Vortex"" segment."
