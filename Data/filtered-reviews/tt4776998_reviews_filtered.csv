" Very close war surveillance journey this movie is.
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,8,"Chose this movie for the cast, both the lead roles have not missed a chance to surprise the audience in every script they select. Written well and cropped, no scene sequences were giving clues to go on a traditional way of ending, watching this movie made me feel like i have read it as a book or a war journal, thats how it opens up its essenced paragraphs. And thats makes me again cherish the cast."
" Total falsification
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,2,From film perspective very slow. From historical point of view totally falsified.
" This isn't TRUE
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,1,Truth is Armenian Gangs attack Turkish villages they killed Turks and when the Ottoman Empire is going down Armenian people sold Turkey because they always wanted their country as a free.
" Excellent movie
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,10,This is an excellent movie about an event that is rarely discussed.
" Excellent
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,9,"The Armenian experience is not widely publicized. The American stance is that Turkey is an ally therefore we don't need to mention what happened. It was genocide. This movie presents more of a personal account of families, friends and loved ones who were affected by the Turks driving them out of their homeland. The acting was excellent with special kudos to Oscar Isaac for his sensitive portrayal of Michael Boghosian a man passionate about medicine and his responsibilities. If you are looking for a movie that will enlighten as well as entertain I highly recommend The Promise."
" A Promise
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,5,"A Promise for a long boring movie , viewing i side story"
" They took you for a ride
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,1,"There is a lot more to be told in the history of Turks and araminians ...telling the story from an Arminian point of view is cutting the complete image..people need to know what the Arminian did to deserve such hate from the Turks..
There are many books and articles explain the truth."
" Disturbingly great
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,"I was amazed to see all these well renowned actors in this movie. That could in just over 2 hours span over so many events and details of this horrific genocide and the build up is impressive. A ""Schindlers list"" for the first genocide.My only concern is that it did not mention the other christian orthodox brothers and sisters, mainly the greeks and syriacs who suffered the same hardships but its minor. What happened to the armenians happened to all of us.Hopefully, just like ""Schindlers list"", this will be a educational movie for the rest, to not forget, to remember, what happens when nationalism and hate takes over and faschism rule. Lets try remind ourselves and our children so that history will not repeat itself.Me myself is of syriac and greek descent in the diaspora of Sweden together with hundreds of thousands descendants from the ruins of the byzantine empire."
" False rating
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,"Exciting, beautiful, sad, and also well directed and well played."
" Not really a subjective story
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,4,"With this type of movies where a light spot is pointing on a historical event, I would like to see a subjective story and here, clearly is not."
" A Great and Wonderful Film, And:
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Making a film is a wonderful adventure, the trip of a lifetime for all wanderers and dreamers, but like writing a book, an article, an advertisement or painting an admired painting we eventually learn that all good films disturb us, they re-awaken old memories, hatreds, loves, travels and journeys evidenced by when this film ended I wanted to go to Armenia, I wanted to read more about the forgotten Armenian massacre and to learn more about the star of this film Charlotte Le Bon, I compared her to Ingrid Bergman and imagined with good reason that if she lived and was active in the 1930s David Selzick would have sent for her and made her a star, a huge film star way up there with Bergman, Garbo, De Havilland, Taylor and Deborah Kerr. The subject of this film was harrowing because it did happen, it was a tribal massacre by the Turks - Turkish fools who even today deny and attempt to hide what they did. So let me profess here that this film made me pro-Armenian and not a lover of Turks or the Turkish Govt (Nazis wearing a Fez) and may I say thank you to all the cast, the producers and directors. May you all prosper, this is a great and moving film, thank you. A Limey from England. 04-01-2021."
" Great Storyline
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,10,Great storyline based on historical facts. Loved the writing and how it told a story of important occurrences of the past. Definitely recommend to everyone.
" Lie lie lie
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,1,Complete nonsense. The maximum that you can fit into one movie!
" A political very colored film, historically doubtful
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,1,The story could've been much more believable when the political part was kept away. Unfortunately the makers or funders as you wish wanted to make a statement in this movie. If you want your opinion kept clear don't watch.
" Another 10 from Chris Bale
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,10,This fact based drama is one of the most moving movies you will watch. How love can live amongst evil is a miracle. The Armenian genocide is heart breaking.
" Falls a bit short
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,7,"The ""love"" storyline distracts too heavily from what should already be an enthralling topic. Couple that with some of the historical inacuracies and it opens itself up to further criticism than it already receives for covering such a contraversial subject. Well written a watch but it really fails short of its potential by trying to be all things to all men and it loses its impact. This is especially disappointing considering the stellar cast!"
" No historical accuracy
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,1,"It is not movie, it is show of diaspora. It is not hard to understand how these stars was given."
" Why only Americans tell the truth?
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,1,This movie is complete false. Yahoodi's always been against Turkey.
" GREAT MOVIE Being down-voted by genocide denialists
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,10,This is a great movie with important historical references. It is educational but with a great story line. I encourage people who are curious about history to watch and enjoy this movie
" This was our reality
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,The Armenian genocide happened and it hurts to see. But big thank you to the whole team for made this film. I couldn't hold my tears.
" No worth it
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,1,"Not recommend, fake history. Absolutely dont like it...Propaganda and lies around."
" Low quality

" truth about armenian genocide

" Fake
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,1,Interesting how hays (so-called armenians) can make people believe in things that never happened
" Based on fake information

" Great movie
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,I watched the movie I was in tears .. the horrors of the Armenian Genocide is something you cannot forget or deny
" Historically 100% accurate
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,This is very eye opening. I had heard of these kinds of historical facts through word of mouth. Seeing it on the big screen is deeply moving. Highly recommended for anyone interested in historical love stories.
" To prevent other genocides
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"To prevent other genocides, world must convict armenian genocide!"
" Boring one
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,1,"Do not recommend at all...
I could spend this waste time for other purpose !"
" Awful movie
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,1,Does not worth to watch. Full of fake information and boring. Lost my time
" Heart touching and true story
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"Great cast, wonderful work done. The movie is a must watch if you enjoy history, plot switching and drama. The movie is based on true story, reminding the world about the Armenian genocide in 1915. It is for sure a life changing movie."
" HISTORY
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,1,"We all see how Armenians behave with their neighboring countries. Genocide is just fantasy, imagination and the way to show themselves as victims in order to cover their terrorism and steal more lands from others. This small country is well known with its' so many terror-acts event in XXI century and they are proud of that. If movie is romantic, it should not be mixed with politics and fake history."
" So true
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,Sad story but true! I hope it will never happen again!
" This movie is highly underrated
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"The movie is down-voted by some people, who want the truth to be buried.
The film is about the Armenian genocide, of course, what is shown is just a
light version of what actually happened.
The whole film is not about killing. It has at its core a wonderful love story, the film overall is really interesting.
Those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it."
" Ignore the fake 1 star reviews-this is a must see!!
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"Obviously all the low ratings are posted by Azeri/Turkish bots, this is such an amazing film, an absolute must see!!! if you enjoy history, this is one of the best historical films, amazing actors and imagery. Highly recommend."
" lie lie again lie history
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,Very well funded by armenian diaspora based on fake and false information. No truth at all. Have a look to history and archives which will reveal you how armenians lie over and over
" Accurate Portrayal of The Armenian Genocide
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"The Promise captures the events of the Armenian Genocide, the first Genocide of the 20th century, and it does a great job of showing the atrocities done by the Ottoman Turks. I highly recommend this movie."
" Nor real, liers
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,"Waste of time and money
Liers only did this film
Too many unrealitiws"
" Mixed up genres
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,"I found it quite disrespectfull towards spectators to indicate movie genre ad ""history"", while it's clearly a fantasy."
" Based on false story, should have been in fantasy category
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,Based on false story. Not recommended to watch unless you like fantasy.
" This movie just melted my heart
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,There are several of my favourite actors and the actions and directing... AMAZING!!! Couldn't watch without tears
" A Fantastic Movie
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"It's a real masterpice. It reflects the tragic part of armenian history -the Armenian Genocide of 1915. The mass murder and expulsion of 1.5 million ethnic Armenians carried out in Turkey and adjoining regions by the Ottoman government. Some people who deny it downgrade the film, but they don't understand that they have to accept it. There are so many facts that no one can deny the reality. What concerns the film I should say that it's really a fantastic movie . The acting is just superb."
" I do not advise you to watch
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,Very bad film and boring. Armenia is an occupying state. They committed genocide. Armenians kill children. It is an occupying country.
" Amazing film!!
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,It is sad that we are living in world where the people who committed the 1st genocide (in the film) are now trying to commit the second one. I am a descendant of a genocide survivor and I hope one day the evil will be punished! This film is very impressive and totally based on real stories...
" Heartwarming
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"It is much appreciated that after all the massacres towards Armenians someone speaks up... history is important for Humanity, so people will prevent something like that in future!"
" Sad history
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"I strongly recommend to watch this movie as it is based on historical events. Great actors, great producer."
" Amazing job by the director and the entire staff
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"A great depiction of the most outraged and unrecognized event of the 20th century- the Armenian genocide by Ottoman Turks.
After 100 plus years the history repeats itself. Nowadays too Armenians of Artsakh are being murdered and are forced to leave their homes. And again we see Turkey as the organizer and executor of this maleficent plan.
This is a very painful story as the parents of my grand grandparents were genocide survivals and my grandma told us stories of how her grandparents fled to Iran and the difficulties they faced to survive.
Highly recommend this movie. The leading actors are amazing!"
" What is this!
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,1,"This film isn't really.... haven't any facts, haven't any real situation..... l research conflict...
and l watched film ""endless coridor"" about khojaly genocide...: this film is very well.... I really like... because film taken by foreign directors... and Khojaly genocide from other country""s eyes....
And this film is not really... 1915???? Why???!

" Powerful movie about Armenian Genocide!
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,The story how osman turks killed the peaceful Armenians in their homeland! Just for they are armenians((( it's about love and friendship in the very hard times for Armenians.
" Awesome movie
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,A true description of not only the events of 1915 but the events that are still happening now. Highly recommended
" Very well filmed

",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,"This film is well worth the watch to understand the horrors inflicted upon the Armenian people. Do NOT let the low review sway you. Notice all the single star reviews are VERY recent. Most from November 1. Why? Because Azerbaijan has begun killing Armenians again and their internet trolls are trying to sway public opinion through lies. The whole world now acknowledges what was done to the Armenian people by Turkey. It is time the Azeri and Turks do so as well and also recognize Artsakh""s sovereignty."
" It was GREAT!!!!!
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,The great movie about the TRUTH! Long live Armenia
" Another falcification by armenia
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,"This is fake story. Armenians are shouting about genocide at the same time helding etnical cleansing against Azerbaijan Nation since years. ""Endless Corridor"" it is about genocide against Azerbaijan Nation in Khojaly on February 26, 1992"
" One-sided and biased
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,The movie only reflects one side without considering the other side. Such biased movies serve to brainwash people against another group.
" True rating for exaggerated depiction.
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,The movie grossly misrepresents true evens and therefore depicts hate.
" Waste of time
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,The film is based on fake genocide history. As usual armenians have nothing to show except their fake imagination

" Movie that doesn't have anything to do with the history
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,"It's a shame that the filmmaker's talent was spent to make this movie which presents falsified history to a viewer. Sometimes I wonder why the actors like Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac act in movies like this without making proper research about what really happened."
" Fake history
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,The movie is fake. It is created by the help of Armenian diaspora for propaganda of so called Armenian Genocide.

" FAKE History
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,This is a false history that I have never seen anywhere.Actors fake in the players. It's like a cartoon
" Not Based on Historical Facts
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Very biased and false presentation of the events of those years as well as of the Ottoman Empire image. Very disappointing, since you see such a film cast, and pretty obvious that neither the cast nor the film director cared enough to get familiar with actual history and research historical facts, that represent the truth about the so-called armenian genocide, since respected and well-known historians, like Bernard Lewis, Patrick Walsh and Justin McCarthy give good analysis of the armenian insurrection in Ottoman empire, their betrayal alliance with Russian Empire against Ottoman Turkey and slaughter of many Turkish civilians by armenians.
So, wouldn't recommend this movie, as you'll have to check every single historical fact."

" Movie supports fake history
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,I would give higher rating if the genre was fiction but since fake history has been highlighted in the movie i would give nothing but lowest rating.
" Excellent movie
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,Excellent movie represents real tragic events during the Armenian genocide
" I dont like this.
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,Bad acting. Weak plot.It didn't pique my interest.
" Bad
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Nonsense and made up. It's a pointless and illogical scenario, lousy players bla bla Everybody thinks they can make a movie"
" This is nothing but lie
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"There is not even an evidence that prove this act by turks, Ottomans precisely. So it should not be a topic for film"

",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,The director of this movie was not filming only a fictional love story but also contributing the hate and racism based on fake history of Armenian politics. Stop poisoning the international community with dirty Armenian propaganda.
" Waste of time

" Fake story

",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,Waste of time. Don't watch it at all. Actors are absolutely weak and scenario has a lot of historical mistakes.
" Big lies - You need careful historical analysis
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,The film needs documentaries be well investigated. History is different from the film.
" ABSOLUTELY DISAPPOINTING!
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,This film is based on a lie. You can see that in the first minutes. Who chose these actors in the first place? They can't act at all. An absolute disappointment! Please save your time!

" Not accurate at all
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,A movie based on not proved facts. Acting is awful and storyline isn't accurate at all.
" A matter of debate
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,2,"You cannot direct the movie that pretends to be historical unless so called ""armenian henocide"" is proven fact which is not the case. If you do some research you will find out that apart from armenian talks there are no documents to prove that. Moreover, Armenians tell about 1,5 million people affected by this ""genocide"" however there were only 1 million Armenians in Turkish empire overall. Once again we should not support movies propagating unproven facts promoting unnecessary enmity to turkish nation"
" Even 1 is too big a score
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,Very biased and made up representation of events. Misleading and untrue.
" Based on fake story
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,When you do a deeper research you will see the movie is actually propaganda tool. This dake genocide is exaggreated by armenians. They like to seem opressed. Dear lord :D Anyways 1 is more but there is no zero

" Border film
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"I wanted to watch a film based on a historical basis, but I saw the director's fiction. A boring and about nothing film. I do not advise you to watch, only to waste time. I advise you to watch the Endless Corridor, where the whole truth is reflected and a very entertaining film."
" Hmm
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"It was so funny. I don't like fantastic movies, but I watched it. a movie without historical basis. I do not advise"
" Showing distorted historical events.

" Fiction as always.
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,This is another option in order to mislead people about real stories.
" Weong story
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"The film which is filmed regarding ""armenian genocide"" is nothing more than fairytale. This isnt proved and armenian government refuse the call of turkish government to gather all historians together and open archieves and other materials to discuss what did really happen. They refuse it so it is unacceptable story. Cant be taken serious"
" Such a good story to get to know the reality
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,"It si always good to remember that there are always two sides. There were some Turks who helped Armenians. Anyways, Turkey commited genocide against Armenians."
" Very interesting

" Sad reality
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,"This story is so touching and heart breaking ,and it becomes even more when you realize it is based on real facts.People really had to go through all this vandalism and yet they had no way but to live.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
" Tragic reality
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,"Everyone should watch this move to keep the promise to never forget the inhumane and brutal tortures Armenians went through!!
A true masterpiece!!"
" Heartbreaking reality of genocide of Armenians
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,Armenians faced this in 1915 are facing it once again in 2020 by same Turkey. See the truth and understand the Armenian reality.
" I am speachless. Full of emotions.
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,Emotinal. the best movie I have seen based on the real facts
" Unfocused
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,4,"The script is the biggest weakness in this picture, the acting was great the direction was horrible because the movie did not choes one way to revel the story, is it a love story, is it a political drama, is it a tale about the armenian genocide.
The script trayed to be all these thing and field miserably and showing the Turks as puer evil is bad, the script should have to explained why things is happening."
" Boring.
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,1,"If you want to talk people about a genocide, dont try to make it by filming a love triangle god damn it. I baray had the patience to finish it. How can you take such an intresting plot and execute it so poorly. Shame."
" Great movie
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,8,"Great movie that shows how bad and arrogants are the turks. Untill today they are unpunished. They have invaded libya, siria, cyprus , armenia , meditterean sea and nobody stops them. They do not regognise the genoctoside both armenias and greek people. Great respect for Bale to take part in this movie. Below of this comment you will find out how the turks are arrogants"
" MUST WATCH
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,10,"Watching this film hit close to home, I am a Chaldean Catholic (Family from modern day Northern Iraq), this has been the first time I have found any type of coverage on this part of history or at least mostly covered the reality of Turkish involvement in WWI... I say this movie was well written and filmed and that One day they will have to admit to their true intentions... If not voluntarily but who knows what discoveries we might come across to expose their hidden truths."
" Politics always gets in the way of the truth
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,9,"I don't know much about Turkish - Armenian history but the fact both still hate each other today, many countries support a similar view on who was the aggressor and who the victim tells you what was depicted in the movie can't be far off the truth.Leaving the politics at the door, this was a good movie, well written, directed, filmed and acted, though not sure Bale was at his best here. Most of the negative reviews are from people with little integrity and even less honour but a clear political agenda.Not sure the at times hard to believe love triangle was necessary though, a straight love interest wouldn't have made much difference to the final product, but this is what happens when you let Hollywood loose on history. The genocide wasn't enough on it's own so some writer buffoon thought it needed a bit more spice, it really didn't need complicated romantic overtones!Seriously underrated movie, make an effort to see it if you haven't already."
" Terrific movie of a horrible genocide
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,10,Don't miss seeing this movie. The genocide of the Armenian people needs to be told and learned. The love story makes it an interesting movie to watch but it is heartbreaking to be reminded of the evilness of mankind. History should not be erased as we need to learn compassion from it.
" Great over all!!
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies I watched in the last few years. Great acting, great writing. Warning...get tissues ready."
" False rating
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,8,"Much better movie than the rating here. Excellent cast and production in a story that most people do not know about: the genocide of the Armenian people by the Turks during WW I. Strongly recommended, excellent film."
" Beautiful and underrated film
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,10,"A part of history not often taught or spoken about, this film does a beautiful job of telling this history through the eyes of a few people and the important role of a free press. Amazing performances from the whole cast."
" Great movi and accurate
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,10,"I was wandering why this movie has low rating. It is definitely not because of movie but i believe some who rated it, had different agenda.
Movie is really good, great actors and acting.
Very accurate described historical story which is still very painful for many."
" Eye opening and heartbreaking.
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,2,"I was lead to this movie by a reviewer for The Ottoman Lieutenant. They stated if you want to see Historical facts, watch The Promise. Well I just finished it and was blown away. Such a riveting and compelling story."
" Heart Wrenching
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,9,The only thing I would change is having all signing of the cross performed as in the Greek Orthodox Church rather than as is done in the Roman Catholic Church.
" Loved it
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,9,Excellent movie. I think IMDB needs to look into why a 6.0 rating is showing up since the reviews are so good.
" Amazing!
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,10,"It is the harrowing tale of a definitive act in world history. This is a genocide. Unfortunately, media outlets fail to cover most atrocities in the same light."
" Heart breaking movie got me emotional
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,9,"I watched this with my dad and after watching the movie on August 14-15, 2020 , he told me that it was a great movie. Honestly I read reviews and heard some people rated lowly. While the others gave good rating, still people thinks differently an have thoughts on the movie. Apparently not everyone views the films they watch are the same. So respect their perspective of the film or don't waste your time talking with people who cares about their giving their honest review of the film.Since I'm not big movie reviewer here are few things I love about the movie...It's based off real life events because many people in the past must've suffered lot, hurt and it portrays what's it like trying to face the harsh reality of Armenians being shot down by the Turkish just to have control over their country.The acting was also excellent, and did a good job at showing emotion, such as grief, sorrow, and other emotions as well.Movie was well made and to be honest the creators of this film spend money to make this movie. No matter how much you view the film from your perspective respect the creators of the movie, and accept as the way it is, especially how they're filmed. They spend bunch of money on a film!I can see why the movie was called the promise, which is the promise the two men made will always be there for them, but over the course of the movie it saddens me of what happened to the love of their life disappear before their eyes. And I like how there isn't too much romance, honestly let it be because there's still people out there who are still into them whether you like it or not. Deal with it or don't deal with it.Overall, in my opinion this was a good movie to tell the truth, and I would love to watch it again."
" Powerful and moving story
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,9,"I'm wondering why the rating on IMDb is so low. Rotten Tomatoes viewers rated it 92%, much better than the 6 out of 10 rating it got on this site. The acting is first rate and the movie is compelling. The Armenian Genocide is a fact that some people choose to deny, but this film shows the horror and pain that was inflicted on the prisoners."
" The Promise🇦🇲
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,10,"As an Armenian-American teenager, I am very aware of the atrocities committed by the Ottoman Empire against my ancestors. But still, seeing it portrayed in a film like this brought tears to my eyes. I loved the music especially. It is so important for people to see this film, especially non-Armenians. For too long the horrors of the Armenian genocide have been ignored and denied and under-documented. To this day, Turkey does not admit responsibility. This film is proof that the Armenian people will never stop fighting for justice for our ancestors. So please, if you are considering watching this film, do so. Whenever I recognize an Armenian last name in a film I always get excited, but actually seeing a film about my people (albeit very Hollywood-esque, understandably so) makes me proud to know where I come from. A strong, resilient country, that will never disappear, no matter how hard you try. That is our promise."
" Fascinating Story
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,10,"I enjoyed this movie very much! As a Turk, I never realized my ancestors did such horrible acts. In school we were always taught that nothing had happened in 1915, but after watching this movie, I did some research and found out what had actually happened in 1915. The evidence is overwhelming. I highly recommend this movie to everyone."
" Amazing story
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,10,This was an amazing movie . Representing another angle of the Armenian genocide . Must watch .
" Fiction movie
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,2,"Funny fiction movie. So biased. Good acting. In 1914 there was no country named Turkey. And no flag like that. Exile is true, also some indicidual war crimes happened but showing the entire Turks as barbarians is very funny and it made the movie an unrealistic fiction."
" The murders were by the Ottoman Empire not Turkish Government
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,6,"The overall movie was good but the murders were done by the Ottoman Empire, not Turkish government.
When you write your ratings with a fierce hatred, just note that it wasn't the Turkish government and that Turkish flag didnt even exist at the time of the murders. Turkey as a republic was founded and named in 1923 by Ataturk and many soldiers who did not have anything to do with the genocide. The movie is lacking such crucial points as it calls Ottoman Empire as Turkey (it is not), and shows today's Turkish flag which did not exist back then. They could have used Ottoman Empire's flag and name instead of today's Turkish Republic's credentials. But thanks for being brave and tell a lesser known story with your film."
" Wonderful
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,10,One of the only films that takes place during the Armenian Genocide. A beautiful film that I hope inspires more movies about the genocide to be made in the future.
" A harrowing movie
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,10,I cannot understand how people think they have the right to downgrade a movie that depicts the reality of history. Sadly the atrocities depicted have been repeated in different parts of the world & we as a race have not learnt from this. The movie is faultless in detail & acting.
" An epic tale
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,8,"A pretty good movie, it has drama, suspense and action, very entertaining."
" Everybody has to watch it...
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,6,"""The Promise"" is a Drama movie in which we watch the Armenian genocide that happened during the last days of the Ottoman Empire. Many people were killed and many others lost everything they had and they had to relocate in other countries.I liked this movie because it shows the truth behind the Armenian genocide and what really happened in those days. The Ottoman Empire at its last days wanted exterminate Armenians, Greeks (Greek - Pontic genocide) and Assyrians. In this movie we follow a young Armenian man who is going to Constantinople to study in order to become a doctor but everything change when Armenians are starting to be chased by the Turks. I believe that this movie is very good and well based in the history of the Armenian genocide. I highly recommend everyone to watch it because it is a life lesson."
" Obsoletely stunning movie!
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,I'd say this is one of the most heart touching creations based on facts... not to even mention the play of actors' team. Hope they are ok after going through a such horrendous emotions relieving the tragedy of Armenians who were murdered in their own homeland by Yerit turks just because they were Christians and they were Armenians...
" Getting the word uit really well
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,10,This movie was a good way to teach non Armenian people about what happend in a mild way.
" The best film! 😢
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,10,"For me, it's the best film about Armenian genocide."
" Great film!
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,10,Great film!Must watch every person and recognize Armenian genocide
" Under rated
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,10,"To rate it under 5, one must either not have seen this film or feel uncomfortable with the theme and want to sink it.
Then, there may be some other films taking a different approach that will suit better some people, but nothing can be to everyone´s taste.
I will not repeat or paraphrase what other reviewers already wrote. I am only rating it 10 so the average rate goes up as the 5.9 is really not representative.
It is a difficult theme but the film succeeds brillantly at telling it in a sensitve way.
It is definitely not for a young audience but it is a must be seen for all the other viewers."
" Good storytelling
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,8,July 2018: Tough - good storytelling - little history lesson as well.
" Powerful film
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie educated and entertained me at the same time. The love triangle is the main theme throughout but there are so many other things going on that you sometimes even forget about the love story. I never knew about this period in history and I am now eager to learn more. very enjoyable, acting and directing is solid. Worth the watch"
" Shame on you genocide deniers.
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,10,"I liked this movie, and I gave it a 10 so that it counteracts the low scores it has received primarily by genocide deniers.
Whoever they are, they should be ashamed, because trying to squash any film on this subject shows a sign of GUILT, in my opinion.
The sooner the Turkish Government acknowledges what it has done the better, all this denial for fear of reparations. Disgusting. You know you are wrong, you know you are doing a bad thing. The more we hide in the dark, the worse the skeletons in the closet become.
Shame on you, just as bad as deniers. May Karma give you what you deserve.Anyway this film was wonderful in many ways."
" Gripping epic.
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,10,"Great acting, great story even though it is true and sad. Incredible tale, what makes for truly interesting and gripping story telling. One of the best movies my wife and I have seen in a while."
" 1.500.000 Armenians were killed - that's the truth
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,10,Denying that is denying Turks own history. Hey need to be finally brave enough to face it.
" Good movie despite politics
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,8,I know that film was created to make the public opinion hate turkey. it's 2016 production that make me guess it was made upon immigration crisis. in general the film is good especially the first hour.
" Best movie
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,10,Very good movie. All the negative reviews are from turks. Who dident watch the movie and gave 1 star.
" I think must be forgotten the purpose of art.
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,3,"Or must be on purpose with suitable conditions... first of all there is a remote history embedden on scenario. In this frame, it should be a movie fed and feed from social conflicts. If I need to think about of this movie without all its ulterior motivations, it is just an ordinary love story happened in fictional war period. Hope people get their references within this motivation. Because it is very far away from history, especially from true history. Thank you."
" An ok film with a statement
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,7,"It is a good thing that the Armenian genocide gets more attention. The Turkish government is lying about it, just like they deny their intentions to kill the Kurdish people.Is it a good film? Well, its a love story, a know fact of the French playing a role and the horrific genocide the Turks committed.Therefor it has a lot of 1's and a lot of 10's. The war is still continuing. When will we grow up as humanity?"
" Incredible story about sad times of human history
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,9,Best movie I've seen this year. Story based on real events and amazing performance. Can't believe this movie didn't do well on Box Office. This is what happens when people are mixing politics with films.
" The real deal
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,9,IN CASE YOU WEREN'T AWARE - Don't buy into the ratings for this film. It was hijacked the day it came out in order to discredit it by Armenian genocide deniers. Great movie and worth knowing about.
" One of a kind masterpiece!
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,10,"Have never seen such a deeper movie than this; a movie about family, love, and hope. Although this is a fictional storyline, the backing history behind the movie is true. Truly remarkable to bring something to light that is overshadowed by other tragedies that occurred throughout history. Must see, and will make you cry!Overall, the movie is great and Oscar Issac's masterpiece for acting. Hope he wins awards in the near future for playing so many different roles in various movies. Christian Bale could have done better, kind of hard to picture him not as Batman after being identified with it for so many years as an iconic superhero.You have to see it at least once!"
" Fantastic movie
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,10,"This is a great movie, well made, and matches the history of what happened."
" An amazing movie
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,10,"A heartwarming movie which shows how the Armenians were massacred in the hand of the Ottoman Empire. Thank God that there were many foreigners like the french, germans missionaries, american journalists which they reported it back home and the evidences remain untill today. A very emotional, beautiful movie. I recommend everyone to watch it"
" Genocide of the Armenians
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,10,"More than one million Armenians were slaughtered by the Ottoman Turks from 1915 to 1921. Turkey has always denied that this ever happened. This fine movie was inundated with phoney reviews procured by the Turkish Government. The result was a box-office disaster for the movie.
Well worth watching."
" Genocide iof the Armenian Christians
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,10,"This is the movie that the Turkish regime under Islamist Erdogan tried to sabotage and largely succeeded in doing so. The story of the murder of over one million Armenians needs to be better known, and this movie certainly helps. It rarely happens that a movie is historically accurate; this one is. I give it a 10 despite the fact that I thought the love-triangle a lot silly."
" Real War Drama in 1914 !
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,8,"A good history and war movie. Well casted and well played by leading actors. Good photography and well scripted story. The story is a medical student who wants to become a doctor and went to Turkey at his relative's home, but unfortunately he find himself between home war of Turkey. Will he keep his promise to become a doctor and return to home town to marry with his fiancé? Or will he engage with his new love attraction? And what is end of the war? You just see the movie to answers. Good acting by Oscar Issac , Christian Bale and rest the cast. Perfect casting and real war background story definitely binds you to your seat till last. The story having love triangle (a rectangle as me), sacrifice for friendship, hungry army to kill innocent people etc. The period of the movie was shown in 1914, but there is not much change in recent 2019, you can find such blood thirsty nations and their armies today too!
It is a good movie, must watch. Low ratings are unrealistic. Never judge movie from ratings.!"
" I am Muslim and I reject all types of racism
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,7,"Love triangle in a wartime, specifically during Armenian genocide by Turkish at the beginning of WWI. I am Muslim and I reject all types of racism, this genocide is a big shame in the history of Turkey, honestly, I didn't know a lot about this massacre, but after I watched '' The Promise'' I browsed the internet to read more about it, that's why I like biography movies because they bring attention to forgotten stories despite ''The Promise'' not classified as a biography movie but what is showing about Armenian genocide it is true.I like the movie, but have a comment about the love story, I think if Terry George made one love story instead of this complicated love triangle, it will be more emotional, it just made me confused which couple I must sympathize with them where all of them were good people !!! So I didn't connect a lot with them except the genocide that actually hurt me."
" Best Movie reality based
",2019-06-07 00:00:00,10,"Best Movie reality based Ever, so many haters here who enjoy committing genocide against armenians, Greeks and Kurds and made low rating here"
" Such a good, good movie.
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,10,"Realistic , So beautiful and a realistic perspective on how crude the Turks were in the Armenian genocide. Fantastic movie. Not sure why overall rating is 6.1 when so many people have given 10's, starting to think this website does not calculate its ratings correct."
" Fantastic and realistic
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,8,"I'm not sure why the rating is a bit lower than expected on this movie... It's incredible, well thought-out and a bit genius. The only thing that I thought was a little weird was the fact that he had a woman where he lived already before he started flirting with Ana in the beginning. That creates trust issues and such... plus she diddd already have a man... still, besides this it's great movie."
" What a GEM! Cannot believe I never watched this.
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,10,"First off, I am not a fan of love stories. There is a love story woven into the narrative. But this only serves to tell the grand story of the Armenian Genocide by the Turks.
The movie is breathtakingly beautiful. Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale are amazing actors, and serve their roles perfectly.
I don't often recommend movies. I recommend this to absolutely anyone. It starts a bit slow, but then you are caught up in the story quickly. This is a must watch!OBTW. This movie was hit hard by Turkish bots. The IMDB score is around 7.0, but would be much higher, prob 8.5 to 9.0 if not hit by the Turkish bots.
If you don't know why, look up some history on the Armenian Genocide."
" Fantastic movie, great story!
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,10,"The simple fact that this occurred is hard to deal with. The movie has great actors that give great performances. I WATCHED the movie and it is well worth the time. Excellent story, excellent acting. Harsh truths however. It speaks of the factual horrors that occurred."
" Don't believe the low ratings
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,8,"Much better than the ratings would suggest due to Turkish deniers of the Armenian genocide. Well acted, though Christian Bale doesn't get to stretch his acting abilities to the degree of other two leads. Though the story is ""historical fiction"", the actual historical parts they got correct and is an important and painful film to see (especially concerning recent history under Erdogan). Yes some parts close to maudlin, but overall worth seeing but not a happy film."
" Geat movie.Must watch it.
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,10,"Geat movie.Must watch it. Couldn't watch it without tears on my eyes. This is a true story of a nation who have struggled for their freedom, being surrounded by enemies."
" Absolutely excellent
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,10,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. After seeing it I read about the history of this period in history. I was glad to learn that it was historically accurate. Acting was good and character development was excellent.
" Excellent
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,10,"It is April 2019. I had not heard of this movie until today. I just watched it and had no idea of an Armenian Genocide. I watched it because it was listed under Romance on my Prime Video. Now I don't know what happened prior in regards to the ratings. From reading the other comments/reviews, I see there was some controversy with the ratings. I must say this movie deserved higher Rotten Tomato scores. I gave it a10. Why? Because the movie had everything. I'm a budding writer of Romance and I watched it because I'm a sucker for a love story. But this was so much more. I learned something today about Armenians and Turkish people. Interesting! Great movie!"
" Brilliant movie
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,10,"Just finished watching.
I'm sure there are other movies about Armenian Genocide (as some reviews mentioned), but I haven't seen them. World needs reminding about these kind of events, as we tend to have very short memory, and keep on looking for people to hate.
Brilliantly made movie, and human stories are so relatable.
Needless to say, I couldn't stop crying.
I can never understand where people get a capacity for such horror, merciless and senseless."
" More than a love story
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,10,"Truly great movie. One of my new favorites. I am so ashamed that I don't know more about this piece of history, but I can't stop researching it now. Thank you to those who pushed to get it made. You have done a great thing, though I know it wasn't easy."
" Captivating story about a harrowing period in human history
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,7,"Intrigued by the voting distribution on this film (99% of the votes are either a 10 or a 1), I had to see what all the fuss was about. I was pleasantly surprised to find that The Promise (2016) is a fantastically acted, well directed story. Brought to us by Terry George, the man behind Hotel Rwanda (2004), the film is similarly both a heartbreaking and visceral experience of a sad period in human history. Something has to be fixed about those votes though..."
" A Story Which Needs Telling
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,10,I found the movie fast paced and captivating. True the love story is a sideline but important historical event is told which is still suppressed
" 6.1 Rating? Really?!
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,10,"This is a fabulous movie about the Armenian genocide during WW1. I'm ashamed to say that I knew little about this scar on our human history and am grateful to the makers of this film to lead me to learning more.I'm baffled by the low rating but some reviews have given me their reasonings and can only accept them as accurate. Nothing else than genocide deniers makes sense because the movie itself is beautifully filmed, acted and the plot well constructed.Maybe I'm wrong but thoroughly enjoyed this remarkable and award-worthy piece of film."
" Should have been made in 1917, not 2017.
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,9,"Excellent movie, certainly timely, as we are again witnessing Turkey persecuting ethnic minorities. Not just a sappy story, but well done to show the wide range of Turkish atrocity witnessed by Armenians. We see Turkish sympathizers attempting to undermine the governmental policy causing the deaths of the Armenians, but we also see the greater support from the military and the general population.
It is important, especially in a Jewish Holocaust-aware world that the two events (Holocaust and Armenian Genocide), while similar, did have different goals in mind, although rhetoric was much the same. Forced evacuation from Anatolian Turkey for the Armenians during WW1 was primary concern, not a concentrated extermination campaign such as was Nazi policy in WW2. Wholesale murder did occur in many areas of Turkey, but mainly Armenians were gathered and marched without food, water, or rest to undesirable areas, often until most on the forced march were dead. The film does share many traits with Holocaust films, especially Krystallnacht-esque depictions, trains packed with victims and brutal labor camps. Again, these events did occur and the text at the end is accurate with numbers of Armenian civilians dead, but most of these deaths occurred due to the much more numerous than depcted resettlement marches.
I would like to have seen at least an example of the coerced non-Turkish minorities used to carry out the deportations in exchange for better treatment after, only to be turned against later as well. Remember, the Ottomans were at war on several fronts and needed fighting troops available for the war, not the internal deportations. The Kurds, for their part in the genocide, have admitted wrongdoing and official apologies, yet the main perpetrator, Turkey, will not even admit the event took place. They continue to hide behind the thin veneer of ""Ottoman"" atrocities took place under ""Ottoman"" rule and that the ""Turkish"" government had no role because Turkey was created after the Armenian Genocide ended (technically true, but an unconvincing argument considering power structures were much the same, just the national name changed and 'Empire' collapsed).
Listen to the rhetoric in the film (some of it taken directly from government documents) against Armenians and compare it to modern (post 1975) Turkish comments about Kurds, and you will see an almost exact match. If Turkey could, they would certainly exterminate the Kurds today the same as they did the Armenians just one hundred years ago."
" Ignore the sabotage on this film
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,7,"Great film. A moving about loss, love, hope, courage, and redemption. It will move you. How can Bale and Isaac deliver bad films anyways?"
" A beautiful film worthy of your time.
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,10,"A truly well-acted and poignant film about compersion, real love, humanity and sadly the truth of historic genocide. This isn't just a political movie, it's a love story. A real cryer in so many ways. Deserves far more stars than it received as as other users state, there's something fishy about the release date and negative reviews. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed, it's Christian Bale!!"
" Brilliant
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,10,"Well written, beautifully filmed, brilliantly acted. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I loved Oscar Isaac's performance. Highly recommend!!"
" Not My Cup of Tea
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,6,"I strongly believe the story of the Armenian people has to be
told but not in the context of a woman torn between two men. For me the movie dragged. I don't know if it was writing, direction, rushed dialogue or just bad choice in 'star-power.' I will say the movie did have some ups but there were just way many downs to make it of any interest to me. For those who complain,about the questionable history behind this tale, well let me say one word, ""Hollywood."" Nothing tossed up on the 'big screen' is ever historically accurate. Pushing a political narrative is always more important than telling the real story. You must surrender any hope for accuracy and digest this movie for what it actually is. It is a fictional love story between a woman and two lovers. Like I said, not my cup of tea, but plenty will enjoy it."
" Entertaining
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,8,Very entertaining. Perhaps viewers will be inspired to learn more about the history depicted in the film.
" What the hell?
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,10,"Dang, this tale, was rough ride indeed! This definitely has to be one of those tales one has to be prepared for going in; its history, this is history? dang, but yes, it worked, this was a triumph, a triumph in the telling but not the history, very very very sad indeed; I don't , nor could anyone explain to me a million times why this is a good thing, what happened here, for I will never understand I just am not made that way. But that being said, it was beautiful and romantic its heart wrenching melancholy.I really loved the acting; the man guy banding the repartee with Christian Bale was awesome. It just felt right, I loved to see the softer side of Christian Bale who is really good at intense scenes so when he gets to do something different it really is a treat; and the main guy was really good ; of course I don't know about acting but its as though I could feel what they were going through , smooth segue ways and pretty transitions all against unknown vast idyllic backdrops in which after the terrible aftermath of wars left just a haunting everlasting universal question to our humanity; I mean what type of humans are we?I don't know , but this was yet a fine film, I highly recommend it."
" The a candalous false Turkish government
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,10,They publish false reviews about a well-structured movie that shows what Turkey has been hiding during all those years. A genocide no less important than what the German Nazis did.
" Excellent!
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,9,"In a time of Star Wars, Transformers, Spiderman and Iron man, it's so refreshing to see a movie with some substance. Wonderful yet tragic story with epic scenery and scope. Recommend it highly."
" Great untold story
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,10,Great movie about stuggle and resilient people. There is a little of everything in this drama movie. I can't believe that I didn't know about this. Enjoy
" The Best Movie You Probably Haven't Seen
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Wow. This movie was a surprise find for me and just wow. I feel like this could have been the next English Patient or Titanic with the right marketing. As it were, it didn't make a big box office splash and it was passed over for awards.The story is set in the last days of the Ottoman Empire, during what many refer to as the Armenian Genocide. And therein lies what is probably this film's biggest obstacle. Many countries do not recognize the genocide as a genocide even though the Ottoman government systematically killed over 1.5 million Armenians during World War I. I won't go into the history and politics anymore, but I do recommend that you read up on it.As for this movie, it details elements of the genocide and it includes a love triangle that will break your heart. It's like the Pearl Harbor love triangle, except waaaaayyy better. I cried more times than I can count in this movie, so save it for a day where you welcome heartbreak and destruction. Two thumbs way up."
" Bland dialogue and full of tropes
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,5,"So many times in this movie, I thought, What? that doesn't make sense... In1914, this Armenian woman would not be so familiar with a man she just met. And a super poor old couple gifts him their donkey? doubt it.. And when they were attacked in the streets after the church singing they were invited to take refuge in a hotel. Wouldn't they ask the people in the lobby what the heck was going on? The whole town had suddenly burst into fighting while they were in church!! But they just stole away up into their room without any questions or discussion they were joking and smiling. What?
But mostly the dialogue was so flat with a purpose to just push the plot forward, or it was nonexistent.
And I didn't see the attraction building between the 2 lovers; they just suddenly were in love after very few encounters that didn't seem too meaningful... it was a boring, nonexistent buildup and I had no empathy for their love story which is the funnest part of a romance.
I love Christian Bale and he was great with his role of patient tolerant lover who was the one that developed most. His acting seemed a little cloying towards the orphans near the end of the movie... and why wouldn't he stay by his lover's side when they were being bombed?? What?
A bit too many tropes and unrealistic human behaviors fill the movie. It was beautiful filming and an important story of the plight of Armenians I was grateful to learn about."
" Let there be light
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,10,"The movie is really good, I had never knew about the genocide in Armenia, this movie gave me the knowledge about it, I can understand tha,the reason is really political bbehind this movie's poor reviews. Since my country also has a history of genocide,when around 3 million people died, and how the killers never ask for forgiveness,I understand the intensity of the suffering faced by Armenian people.And the movie depicted it finely,I guess it could be better.
I would naturally give it 7,but,because of the negative rating I am giving this movie 10."
" Amazing movie.
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie was well written. It's very educational, and it sums up all the hardship the Armenian people went through during the Ottoman Empire. I highly recommend people to watch it."
" A genuine war drama movie
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,8,"I confess, I hesitated a lot before watching this movie as it has a relatively low rating. But after reading some of the reviews I decided to go with it. The movie is amazing, so emotional so realistic about war and its consequences, especially on minority group whom suddenly find their lives, their history, their whole world is collapsing on their heads for no reason but hatred.The Armenian genocide is a crime that occurred a 100+ years ago, it's real and it's tragic and we, as human beings, should never forget about it or any other genocide that occurred anywhere in the world at anytime, and especially those which are being done right now as I write these words in Yemen and Syria.The performance was nothing but amazing from all the actors, good directing, may be a bit slow sometimes but necessary and a very good script."
" Effective balance of history and romance
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,6,"It's a shame that this film's IMDb page has effectively been hijacked by trolls because it covers a politically sensitive topic. Over 90% of all voters have either given it 1 or 10 stars, clearly attempting to sway the rating one way or another without actually watching the film and judging it on merit. 'The Promise' doesn't actually focus on the Armenian genocide itself, rather it is set during the final years of the Ottoman Empire and centers for the most part on a developing love triangle involving the main character.Looking at this film objectively and without joining the many others in disputing its historical accuracy, I thought 'The Promise' was an impressive and well-made drama film. The plot is engaging and well-constructed and is effective in balancing the telling of historical events with an emerging romance. It also looks great - the production and cinematography is excellent and it features some stunning scenery. Unfortunately the genuine ratings and reviews for this film have been drowned out by so many one-line one-star fake reviews."
" Below average movie about WW1 financed by Armenians which Armenians vote a 10 and Turks Vote a 1
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,3,"It's a below average to average movie with a few famous names and a love story which could have been better but missed the chance. The rating it got by most critics is a 2-3/5. It's financed by Armenians, mainly one rich Armenian, Kirk Kerkorian. The backdrop is a disputed piece of history during WW1 where Armenians claim Ottoman Empire committed a genocide against Armenians living on Ottoman land and Turks claim that it wasn't genocide, instead, Ottoman Armenians who lived next to the bordering Armenia cooperated with enemy forces during the war and so were sent to another region in the country by law, and on their journey, there were a lot of losses due to causes like hunger and resentment from the local population. More info on that if you're interested: Historical records? Turkey shows theirs, Armenia refuses to. Anecdotes? Some Armenians claim their grandfathers and grandmothers suffered a lot and Turks claim everyone suffered since Armenians betrayed Ottomans and attacked the Turkish population in the first place...Generally, genocide claims are big business. There's money and big politics involved. As far as I can see, Armenia, Europe and the US try to make Turkey accept the obviously bad events as genocide which would put Turkey in a weak place politically, please the Armenian diaspora, and make their own massacres look not so ""alone"". Example: Germany is very happy about the genocide idea and the US has a rich Armenian diaspora to please, which already financed the movie. And Armenia: The opportunity to claim money from Turkey is there with the undeniable bonus of winning the next elections and making Armenians' part in the history into pure victims. And what do the people think? Armenians give a big support to the genocide claims and Turks feel they're wrongly labeled with a past genocide as their grandmas and grandpas also had stories of Armenian atrocities about WW1.Now, does all that affect you watching the movie? Depends if you're interested in history. At least now you know what the sided ratings and comments are about."
" Performances carried throughout
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,7,"The Promise begins in 1914 when the crumbling Ottoman Empire allies itself with Germany in the Great War. That crisis and a stage-managed tide of mindless nationalism triggers chaos, before we witness the dismaying spectacle of people who have lived alongside each other amiably falling violently on their neighbors. Mankind is so disappointing.Starring Oscar Isaac apparently makes him the American Alfred Molina, the go-to actor for a multiplicity of ethnicities - plays Michael Boghosian, a poor but well-connected Armenian medical student in Constantinople. Quite naturally he falls in love with the vivacious, graceful Armenian beauty Ana (Charlotte Le Bon) who tutors his wealthy young cousins. But not only is honourable Michael promised to a girl back in his ancestral village, Ana is in a relationship with a jealous lover, a well-known, daring American journalist (Christian Bale). The Promise is quite a romantic love drama war film based upon true events. Yet at some moments the film's pace is quite slow as it tells its story thoroughly. The acting is top notch and the sets look great, which is the main reason as why this film works out and is above average. The film's budget was far ahead of it should have been, and as a result causing a major box office flop. One of the more overlooked films to have come out in 2017, and with the result of this film flopping, is why films such as this aren't as relevant anymore."
" How could we forget
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,10,So sorry this was overlooked or buried. This was such a depiction of the slaughter that would be denied by so many. Thanks to the brave souls who brought this to life.
" Must see!
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,10,"A great story, pretty accurate, and we'll made. I'm glad somebody made a movie of Armenian genocide after 100 years. I'm Iranian living in US who loathes all genocides and crimes in the world which to this day it continues. When are we going to learn from history? Turkey still denies this reality.....It's a sad story but good watch.Interestingly, Jewish genocide happened 20 years after this. When is this going to stop?...."
" The story
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,6,"Although the story by itself is amazing - several hundreds Armenians fight their way to salvation and escape genocide - the handling is mediocre.
Some people have pointed that the triangle weakens the main theme and I must agree. Another review asserts that the outcome is not focused and tries to include too many things and misses the main one: the Armenian Genocide, a tragedy that makes decent people weep and feel horrible. Though reading a book or watching a documentary can achieve that, I cannot say the same for this film - it is superficial."
" Just about watchable. Definitely not a 1 or a 10
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,5,The film is controversial because of the Turks voting it 1 and the Armenians voting it 10. Ridiculous. The film is visually dark for much of it which is slightly annoying. It feels like a lot of it can be edited out down to 90 mins it's ease but wasn't. It's an interesting story but feels like a poor man's version of titanic. It's just about ok but should be better.
" Pleasantly Surprised
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,10,"I tuned in to watch a love story, but this was so much more. 
I knew some basic facts about WW2,but not much about the attempted genocide of the Armenian people by the Turks. 
This story was beautifully written and acted. The cast is great!
I highly recommend it."
" Don't buy the thumbs down
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,10,Turkish trolls are attacking this title because it reveals something they want to hide.
" The Turkish Government has still not apologized
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,10,"I flipped past this film on many occasions, judging by the inaccurate or stealth description, that the main topic was a love triangle ""amidst the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire."" As many reviewers have noted, the subject of this film is the Armenian Genocide by the Turkish government during World War 1. And to this day, the Turks have not apologized or owned up to the facts. And, under the present ruler, no honest appraisal will be forthcoming from Turkey. Finally, the story has been told, and it needs to be heard."
" A story the world needs to know
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,10,"What a powerful movie based around the beauty and horror of the human race. It's sad to know that these events keep happening throughout history yet only a few of them make it to our history books taught in school. Beautiful movie, thank you to all who made this happen."
" Turks still lying about genocide-75% of Armenians murdered.
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,9,"No big surprise that the Turkish government orchestrated a massive digital troll 1 star down-vote. You can still be arrested in Turkey for just talking about the genocide. Not a 10 star review because I'm not happy that they had to ""sex up"" the film with the main female character sleeping with two different men, neither one her husband. Not exactly honoring the 1.5 million godly Armenians who died. Think Turkey has changed? There's an American, Andrew Brunson, over twenty years a pastor of a small struggling church in Turkey, now in prison nearly two years because he is a Christian. Boycott Turkish apricots and Turkish Airlines until he is released and the genocide confessed."
" Armenian genocide
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,10,Great historical movie. Thank you to the director and everyone that made it possible. The world needs to know about this horrific time in history
" Well written and great performances!
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,10,I can't believe I've never heard of this movie! Wonderful romance and eye-opening historical accuracy. I'm highly recommending this on FB.
" Totally unconvincing in English
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,2,"I don't know why this film was not made in original language. There's nothing worse than actors pretending to speak with foreign accents; it totally destroys the profound nature of the situation, the gravity of a historical event nd the credibility of the story. Whoever made the decision to do this in English was a fool."
" Absolute Masterpiece
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out, and I immediately fell in love with it. I can connect to it on a more personal level, and I really thought the casting was on point. I don't cry during movies very often, but this one had me in tears by the end of it. An absolute masterpiece, I have seen it several times now and I encourage everyone to watch it and educate themselves about the atrocities that occurred during that time era so that it does not repeat itself. Very beautifully put together. It is a must watch!"
" Just promising...
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"The promise is a movie that promises you that something Eye catching is going to happen but it doesn't. 
The movie starts really quick with wonderful wide shots with a obviously high budget, very pleasing to see but nothing new. We get a love aspect quick and sponteanous, the building of the love is the same old, same old. 
One thing it surprises me is that they didn't really exploit Christian bale's talent, his character was missing something, I couldn't get if he was going to be bad or good, there were glimpses of him doing maybe something to make a plot twist but that didn't not happen. The 'plot twist' wasn't that but Ana drowning, bad timing, what a tragedy.
The end was quick as the whole movie, they are all in peace now but there was so much missing.
I know this is a movie based on historical happenings but from a Cinematographical perspective this movie lacked so much and it was made with a basic structure of the typical Drama, War and Love movie."
" Is this a documentary or a historical romance?
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,4,"I think the film maker needed to ponder this question long and hard before taking his 100 million dollar budget and diving in. I chose to watch this film partly because I am a history buff and partly due to the strong leading actors. But it was immediately apparent that this film vehicle is not at all worthy of their acting abilities. At times it was almost painful to see how difficult it was for them to inject any life or believability into their characters. And it is very hard to connect emotionally with characters who do not seem real.Let's start with one of main characters - Ana. She is a French-educated Armenian governess for a prominent Armenian family in Constantinople. She is also having an affair with the American journalist. Now it is very doubtful that this affair was secret -- word got around fast in those days -- but how is it that her employer allows such a loose woman (this was 1914, after all) to educate his children AND even tells his nephew Mikhael that she would make a good match for him? Not believable. The other main characters could have been done well if they had been written well. But the film was so intent on giving us the details of the historical conflict between the Ottomans and the Armenians in their empire, that there really wasn't time to properly develop the characters. They were shallow at best and I just could not get to the point of catharsis. I usually cry in films depicting such tragic and moving events, but to my surprise, I did not shed a tear until the end when the narrator relates the wedding of Mikhael's niece and we read the words of William Saroyan.So if the intent of the film was to tell us all of the events of the Ottoman-Armenian conflict, then give us a documentary please! I would actually be interested to learn about why the conflict started. Was there a Hitler lurking in Anatolia? Or was it a bit more complicated than that? Or, if the film maker really wants to have a love triangle (or quadrilateral since there were actually 4 lovers if you count Mikhael's wife) AND educate us at the same time, please try a mini series. Then there would be time for character development and the sweep of history.The director of photography did not help this film either. Some of the outdoor scenes are shockingly bright and seemed very out-of-step with the subject matter. And the editing? I am no film-maker, but there seemed to be some very sloppy editing going on in the battle scenes especially. All in all I got the impression that this film was rushed into production. Why? I really would like to know.It is truly a pity that trolls posted 1-star ratings in the thousands before the film was even in wide release. While the film is of poor quality, I do not think it deserves such a low rating. But the thousands of 10-star ratings? This film is so far from perfect that the high ratings seem like a mockery. What, have these people never seen a truly well-made film?"
" Waste of Time
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,3,"If you're making a history movie, why are you narrating the story from a narrow point of view? Of course for the political reasons. There are much more to know about World War 1 and what was going on there in Turkey. This movie is just made to calumniate Turkish people. War is harsh, especially if you have minorities who are cooperating with the enemy. 17 million Turkish people died in World War 1. It is so useless to make it seem like Turkish people barbarically and out of blue, killed Armanians. Where is the other side of the story? What Turkish have gone through fighting with French, English, Italian, Greek and Armanian? It is a cheesy, meaningless love theme put into an argumentative view of history. Waste of time, and a dark stain for the name of Christian Bale."
" Amazing movie
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,10,"Wow what a great film. Amazing true story, must watch. One of my favorit film of all time. Great acting. Can't say enough about this film."
" The Promise - Has an Important Story That Must Be Told
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,9,"That American President said ""I swear I didn't have sexual relations with that woman""! Just as the Turkish nation said ""The Armenian Genocide did not happen"" Well, take another look at history and let's see if we can't wipe out a few more million documented peoples of the world! I ask, what do they expect we will believe! ""The Promise"" has caused a stir and mostly for all the wrong reasons.
The generally unbiased IMDb lost a degree of their respected credibility with claims of publishing 'fake' reviews - via persons who wanted to kill off this powerful work. Political Hollywood also seems to have been little or no help. Some say it's just another romantic movie with a historical background - OK, in certain instances that perhaps could be said but, try getting a movie made with a very heavy fact-based theme, such as this, without any human relationship interest. Human relationships represent an attempt to overcome the horrors of war - they make us human. For 'The Promise', some viewers will need to step outside their own cosy comfort zone and look beyond their perceived ' love story' angle and stare the cold face of death directly in the eye! Only then, will the real story be hammered into their unsympathetic conscience. Huge amounts of money have been lovingly lavished on this production - with little chance of big returns. Complete with a carefully selected world class crew in front and behind cameras, this film is utterly breathtaking. It deserves full respect for telling its hideous true story without exaggeration or reverting to cheap 'revenge hate' as we too often see in other genocide depictions. If anything, this movie perhaps underplays certain aspects! 
From Irish writer/director Terry George (himself no stranger to persecution) to prolific Spanish cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe (who gave us those marvellous images in 'The Finest Hours') Wrapped in the haunting music of Gabriel (""Map of the Human Heart"") Yared (Pity they did not use his music for the beginning of the end credits and hold the song till last) It's then graphically brought to life with performances by Oscar Isaac, Christian Bale, Charlotte Le Bon and a huge set of well known, powerful supporting artists. James Cromwell as the American Ambassador to Turkey plays Henry Morgenthau, who amassed and documented some of the world's most sickening atrocities (Genocide) perpetrated on civilians of Armenian, Greek and Assyrian ethnicity at the hands of a subhuman Turkish/Ottoman regime. An Audio recording of chapter 24 of Morgenthau's 'The Murder of a Nation' should be mandatory listening for those looking for a first person account. It tells of the hideous, soul destroying actions of this evil nation at that time. 
Modern movie making doesn't get much better than this. Look at it with compassion not through the eyes of the latest fashions and beauty products or CGI - look at it with the knowledge that real people had to live (and die) through these shocking moments in our terrible human history - at the mercy of repugnant barbarians who still rule a huge majority of this sad earth. Unlike what they may think, they have so much to answer for and answer they must. For all that has been said, this film is a must see experience but, to be seen with an open heart and mind."
" Even the deniers can't vote this down!
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,10,"It doesn't say so in the blurb, but this is about the first genocidal Holocaust in 1915 when the Ottoman empire tried to exterminate the Armenians. 1.5 million Armenian were murdered.It is also, as the blurb suggests, the story of a love triangle. Together they form a wonderful movie, sad but uplifting at the same time.There are many 1* reviews which seem to be the work of deniers - Turkey still refuses to acknowledge the crime of genocide - but it still scores quite highly on IMDB. Don't let the fake reviews put you off. This is a superbly scripted story, brilliantly directed and with oscar-worthy performers. It's not preachy, it's just a darn good, compelling story, excellently told.Watch it!"
" Amazing story within a historic reality
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie was a beautiful love story set within a grim reality of a historic yet horrific event, the Armenian Genocide. The director did a phenomenal job of incorporating specific details of what took place in 1915."
" Best Movie about Turkey History'
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,10,"As a Turk - Turkman, I confess about this history and it is a shame ! BEST MOVIE IN MY LIFE I HAVE EVER SEEN, MUST WATCH MOVIE."
" Finally the Truth
",2018-02-15 00:00:00,9,"Great movie. So glad the truth is now being reported. It is painful to see, but must see we must"
" I absolutely loved it, it made me cry uncontrollably though.
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,10,"Great movie and great cast. The acting, the writing, the setting, all absolutely fantastic. Oscar Isaac is amazing to the extent that he actually over shadowed the rest, every time he is on screen, he shines. And it is about time the suffering of the Armenians is acknowledged and brought to life to honour their memories and their legacy."
" Watch this, because it is truly a great film...
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,10,"This is a film about a point in history that is still, over a century after the events on which the film is based happened. The genocide of the Armenian people in 1915 has still to be admitted by Turkey, despite it being marked by international centenary events in 2015. That, perhaps, explains the film's lack of a full release. But, regardless of the sensitivities of the events, it is still by any measure a truly great film: a gripping story, well acted, a good script, fine cinematography and excellent direction. It deserves to be watched and more widely seen. It deserves to be thought about and talked about."
" Amazing, Heartbreaking, Inspiring
",2018-02-09 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie the day it was released in the U.S. Absolutely loved it....it brought to light an event that happened about a 100 years ago but has never really been dealt with: The Armenian Genocide. It happened practically overnight, in the backdrop of WWI when the world was preoccupied with war. This poor race of people were slaughtered and virtually wiped off the face of the earth. And the world did not respond. A century later and Turkey still hasn't admitted a very well-known fact by the rest of the world; a genocide happened. The perpetrator is still at large."
" Great Film
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie yesterday, the first day of showing here in Tokyo. I had no prior idea about the existence of this movie,I just happen to go the theater and saw the trailer in the lobby. It looked interesting and so I decided to see it... And I am glad I did. This film is so emotional and well acted. You could very well relate to the feelings of Mikael, the lead character. Near the end, I felt the overwhelming heaviness in my heart that left me speechless and emotionally drained. Fortunately the movie ended in a positive note. I don't believe this movie deserves the current rating of 6, it deserves higher, if not 10."
" Yes, it happened
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,6,"THE PROMISE is a would-be historical epic in the Hollywood mould, seemingly inspired by the look and feel of the likes of THE ENGLISH PATIENT. The main story tells of a love story between a beautiful woman, a medical student, and a journalist, but this merely exists in order to depict one of the most controversial events of the 20th century: the massacre of the Armenians by the Turks. Turkey continue to deny that such a genocide ever took place - indeed, for them, this film is a work of fiction, a piece of western propaganda at best. Nonetheless it's shocking, moving, and harrowing, particularly in the latter half of the production. The romantic stuff I could have done without, but there's no denying that this is the kind of story that needs to be told, and Isaac, Bale, and Le Bon are up to the telling."
" Would be much better if it were not a propaganda movie
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,2,"The actors are pretty good and there are some nice scenes in the movie in effort to recreate the Istanbul of the time. However, it tries too hard to wrap romance into a propaganda movie designed to promote the acknowledgement of Armenian genocide. After watching the movie, you have this sense that Turks are awful people. It really is a poor depiction of actual events and complete exaggeration of Ottoman Brutality. Here are some observations:The first 10-15 minutes of depicting the ottoman empire and the different ethnicities within Turkey at the time is pretty goodIt links the start of killings of Armenians to World War I with significant linkage to Germans. It completely ignores other atrocities that contributed to the conflict with Armenians.Armenians sided with the enemy Russia at the time fighting alongside with Russia. Furthermore, they formed gangs to attack Turkish villages. This prompted the Ottomans to retaliate fearing a greater uprising by the Armenians which would hasten the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. This is never referenced in the movie. It is as if Turks started killing Armenians for the sake of killing them (similar to Nazi Germany).Every Turk in the movie with the exception of 1 guy (Emre) is depicted as brutal murderers. Even that 1 guy is killed by the Turkish soldiers for treason...in essence all the Turks were killers.Turkish brutality is exaggerated in every scene with Turkish soldiers murdering moms and babies who are left behind, killing pregnant women by removing their unborn babies and such.  
This is not to undermine what happened as there was clear Genocide, maybe not as systematic or brutal as was in the case with the Nazis. So, it is a bad depiction history at worst or a really bad romance movie at best."

" One Word ""Islam""
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,10,"I just read an article: ""The Promise"": The Armenian Genocide Epic Kirk Kerkorian Spent a Fortune to Make By Brent Lang. And I came across this: There were no public protests at the Toronto premiere, but there is already evidence of a propaganda campaign to discredit ""The Promise."" The film's IMDb page has received more than 86,000 user votes, the bulk of them one-star ratings, despite the fact that the movie has had only three public screenings. That's more user reviews than appear for ""Finding Dory,"" the highest-grossing film of the year. The filmmakers say reaction on social platforms has been equally intense.""The day after we screened the movie, 70,000 people went on IMDb and said they didn't like the movie,"" says Mike Medavoy, one of the film's producers. ""There's no way that many people saw the movie after one screening. There aren't that many seats in the theater.""Judging from the trailer I just saw this is going to be a great movie and I can't wait to see it. If you want to understand why there are seemingly ""negative reviews"" from ""ghosts"" I would strongly urge you to get informed on the issues. You're pretty much seeing the same kind of underhanded campaigns that is done against Israel. And the best places to find out about the Israel and the Armenian issue is to frequent websites like the Middle East Forum, the Middle East Quarterly, Jihad Watch, the Gatestone Institute and FrontPage magazine. Truly, otherwise you wont' have a clue. Just like the negativity about this movie is coming from elements of the Turkish government and those Muslims sympathetic to them, The Jew hatred you're seeing on our college campuses and now spreading across the country is coming from Islamic antisemtism. Specifically groups like the Muslim Student Association (MSA) the Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and the Council on American Islamic Relations(CAIR) who are all directly associated with the the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. Now I have absolutely no shame when it comes to posting these facts. Hollywood has jumped on the Bash Trump bandwagon as well as many celebrities who are not only bashing Trump but also slandering Jews and Israel. So all bets are off as far as that's concerned. As for IMBd they should do a better job of screening these votes as anybody with a brain can see that these overwhelming amount of negative ""reviews"" are a complete farce. And from what I can see of the comments there are people with good sense that are seeing right through it. Like this one: ""It makes me sick all the negative reviews this film is getting by Turks who are too brainwashed to know and accept what really happened over 100 years ago.""And this: ""It is currently April 2, 2017. This movie has had 3 screenings and has not been out yet. Yet it has 92000 reviews with a 4.2 rating. Moonlight, which in February won the academy award for best picture and has been out for months has 117,000 reviews as of today. Do you think that maybe there is a consipiracy to try to sabotage this movie because the Turks do not want people to know what happened during the Armenian Genocide? They are stuffing the ratings with bad reviews so that people don't see this movie. The review organizations should better monitor their sites to get accurate reviews. A disgrace.""And this: ""Fort those of you who are not in the know; a group of Internet trolls gathering on a Turkish message board decided to try sinking ""The Promise"" with bad reviews before it even came out. The movie is about the Armenian genocide that occurred under the Ottoman empire. Turkey, in a failed effort to cover up their crime, is denying the atrocities out of sheer hypocrisy""And this:""As a Turk I was told that Armenian Genocide was a lie. After some research I couldn't actually find any proof to suggest it as well and what we learned made more sense than the genocide. Anyway lie or not I don't think voting bad to prevent this movie to go big screen is just useless. Yes this may be just propaganda but history is never one sided so let people learn""Today there is the mass murder of Christians by Muslims on a scale not seen since the Armenian Genocide. And it's a total blackout when it comes to the mainstream media and our politicians. Read Raymond Ibrahim's book, Crucified Again and his series of articles about the atrocities being inflicted all over the world against Christians by Muslims. The Armenian Genocide was the mass murder of Christians by Muslims.It was only luck that brought me out of my laziness to learn about these issues. I happened to read a novel: The Haj by Leon Uris. About the birth of the State of Israel and right after another book; Because They Hate by Brigitte Gabriel. A book written by a Lebanese Christian. For some reason a light turned on.This last commenter had it right; ""Let people learn""."

" A heartless war set romance
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,3,"A handsomely crafted drama based around factual World War 1 happenings, directed by the filmmaker behind Hotel Rwanda and starring two of Hollywood's most powerful actors, how on earth did The Promise end up being such a flop? It's not an easy question to answer but Terry George's account of the terrible Armenian genocide that occurred during World War 1 at the hands of the Turkish regime is a film that lacks any power, imagination or worst of all for a film like this, a beating heart.Moulding in the stereotypical war time set-up of a star crossed romance, which here involves a love triangle of sorts between Oscar Isaac's kind-hearted doctor in waiting Mikael Boghosian, Charlotte Le Bon's teacher Ana Khesarian and Christian Bale's alcoholic American and Associated Press reporter Chris Myers, The Promise attempts to both shine a light on the atrocities committed against the Armenian people at this time in history, while trying to capture our hearts with romance in the face of adversity but George's film never gets close to getting out of first gear.Despite its well filmed vistas and handsomely crafted production design, The Promise is sleep inducing in its blandness.It's not easy for actors with the skills of Isaac and Bale to be unable to make characters they play come to life but George's stilted direction and unengaging editing cuts down any chances his performers had of elevating the ho-hum material at their disposal to make The Promise a film it promised to be on paper.Done right, this is clearly a film that could've been both an audience pleaser and an awards contender but the whole film feels like a production made with very little love, almost as if everyone involved was going through the motions, no belief that what they were making was ever going to be anything more than run of the mill at best, sad for a production that in theory is a vehicle designed to shine a light on a time in history that some countries to this day are still denying.Final Say – The drama is devoid of tension, the romance cold at best and the performances nothing more than pedestrian, meaning The Promise is a big budgeted event that fails to capture our hearts of imagination. Everyone here can do better and you're best skipping The Promise, safe in the knowledge that everyone involved will surely bounce back from this $90 million dollar critical and commercial flop.1 ½ fainting medical students out of 5"
" A light in the darkness
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,8,"I wanted to see this film after all the controversy over attempts to lower its ratings. That tactic backfired with me because I bought the DVD.Knowing a little about the Armenian Genocide, I was interested to see how they handled such a horrific event in a movie.The film gives a feeling for the build-up and then the beginning of the massacres and deportations if not the complicated religious and political background to the whole thing. We glimpse the horror, often from a distance, but in the end the film celebrates a brave battle for survival and the ongoing sense of identity of Armenians around the world.""The Promise"" can be compared to a disturbing Russian film, ""Come and See"", set in WW2, but many compare it to Lean's ""Doctor Zhivago"". There are parallels, especially in the main character, Mikael (Oscar Isaac), a medical man like Sharif's Zhivago. However it is the love triangle between Mikael, the Paris educated Ana (Charlotte Le Bon) and American journalist Chris Myers (Christian Bale) played out against momentous events that is reminiscent of that earlier movie.With that said, the characters in ""The Promise"" have some miraculous escapes, which tend to come across as typical movie fiction, while in ""Doctor Zhivago"" there is little of that; the characters are swamped by events – it remains the more powerful movie because of their powerlessness.However, there is much to admire about ""The Promise"". It is a sumptuous production with a fascinating setting and actors giving their all. Although Chris Myers initially seems grafted onto the story, eventually he comes to represents those American newsmen, diplomats and missionaries who first let the world know what was happening to the Armenians. Like them this film makes us aware of that terrible, often overlooked event. ""The Promise"" is a heartfelt film that deserves to be seen.I'm surprised Australian filmmakers haven't focused on one particular episode during those times.An Australian officer, Captain Stanley Savige, commanded a group of nine British Empire soldiers that protected thousands of Armenian and Assyrian Christians driven from the city of Urmia in 1918 – events described in ""Secret Army"", a recent book by Barry Stone. Heavily outnumbered, they held off Turkish troops and Kurdish tribesmen who were closing in on the struggling refugees. Their actions saved many lives. But that's a movie yet to be made."
" Don't waste your time!!
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,1,"Too much propaganda in this movie. I don't care about the historical things if they are correct or not. I just want to watch a movie for the script, music, scene, talent... And also just for having a nice two hours. All of these important things lack in this movie. Very sorry that this is not the case with this film."
" Great movie with unfair ratings
",2017-11-11 00:00:00,8,"Great cast and fantastic movie! I did not know about this part of history before. I disagree with the low reviews on IMDb, most of which are related to the story narrated and not to the movie itself. Actors impersonated their role very well, and the picture is well done. Totally recommended!"
" A Story That Had to Be Told...
",2017-11-08 00:00:00,7,"...but that still hasn't been done justice. ""The promise"" is slightly better than its predecessor of the same theme, ""Ararat"". The scenery and settings, specifically of pre-War Constantinople are in fact, breathtaking (if not a bit fanciful). The story is entirely linear and unfortunately falls into trap of turning into a ""refugee"" movie, similar to ""Beyond Rangoon"", or the much more masterful ""The Inn of the Sixth Happiness""; where the protagonist enjoys a wonderful life until civil conflict forces them and a group of refugees to have to escape somewhere. I think the worst part about ""The Promise"" is the historical revisionism; The American Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire (played by James Cromwell) was indeed Jewish, but absolutely no ""Schindler"", in that he did absolutely NOTHING to save Armenians...not a single one. So, the movie has to invent a fictitious American journalist (played by Christian Bale) so Ambassador Morganthau can ""save"" him, somehow redeeming his role in the genocide, when the reality was Morganthau was the one who sat around and documented what was happening from accounts flooding his office while doing nothing. Yet, once again, it is a story that needs to be told, so I'm keeping that in consideration in my rating."
" The IMDb rating is off and someone should investigate
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,10,I previously used this site all the time and now have lost complete trust that it's not being used for really negative political agendas. This is beyond an EXCELLENT movie! I am a Caucasian American so not biased toward either side but I do know the historical validity of that genocide is true and I know the movie is fantastic so how could so many reviews be so strong and IMDb show such a low score?? Please investigate this so your customers can trust the reviews in the future. Thank you.

" Excellent!
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,10,"A gripping account of the Armenian Genocide. Subtle, well-researched and human-centric, it steers away from politics and propaganda. The fact that some countries, led by Turkey, continue to challenge the historical events underlying this movie makes watching it a compelling imperative for anyone who wants to understand what happened during that dark period in humanity's history, less than 100 years ago."
" Raw truth!!
",2017-10-11 00:00:00,10,"This review is addressed only to non biased readers. The film is an exact depiction of historical facts occurred during WWI within the territory of the then crumbling Ottoman state (I am not considering it Empire as it had lost his vast lands by that time). Turkish government of that era conducted a genocide towards the Armenian population (exterminating around 1.5 million Armenians. Simultaneously their genocidal behavior was extended to other non Turkish minorities residing within the nowadays Turkish state. One other major genocide that happened at the same chronological period was the Pontian genocide (Greek natives of the Black sea shores of Turkey called Pontians). The Turks were successful in killing almost 1 million of Pontians, while achieved to depose a vast number of them to other neighboring state of the Black Sea. Both the Armenian Genocide and the Pontian Greek Genocide are denied by the governments of Turkey until today. I am really glad this film has achieved to include both the pogroms in Constantinople (Instabul nowadays) against Armenians, the working camps, deportation methods and extermination tactics that even AXIS nations imitated during WWII. The acting by Oscar Isaac, Christian Bale, and Charlotte Le Bon was of high standards, while I will not forget to mention the minor roles played by major Hollywood actors like Tom Hollander, Jean Reno, and James Cromwell. Overall, it is a film worthy of the money and effort, worthy to be watched, while it will leave the viewer with feelings of sympathy, empathy, anger, and a lack of justice (unfortunately for the last). Highly recommended to watch!!"
" Best film in some time
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,10,This is the best film I have seen in some time. The weaving of the love story with the Armenian Genocide is compelling. This is more than a love story. It is more than a movie about World War I. And there is great care taken to balance the two. Nothing is overplayed. Then the story is set with magnificent cinematography and touching music. Well done.
" A powerful and excellent film of the Armenian genocide in Turkey
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,10,"This film, though containing fictionalised love stories, is otherwise based on true events, and takes much of its inspiration from the famous best-selling novel by Franz Werfel, published in 1933 as DIE VIERZIG TAGE DES MUSA DAGH, and in 1934 as THE FORTY DAYS OF MUSA DAGH. I have a copy signed by the author to his friend Hans Koerner (along with a copy of THE SONG OF BERNADETTE also signed by him). Koerner gave these to me just before his death because of my love of Werfel's writings. In reality, the defiance of the Turkish troops by five thousand Armenians on Musa Dagh mountain lasted for 52 days, though in this film it lasts for only a few days. The rescue of 4000 Armenians, many of them orphans, by a French naval ship shown in the film is based on the real rescue by several French naval ships in 1915. Werfel's novel was filmed in 1982. An attempt to film it in 1934 was prevented by pressure applied by the Turkish Government to the US State Department. Two subsequent attempts to film the novel were also prevented by Turkish pressure. The Turkish Government has always denied that the genocide of the Armenians took place, although everyone outside of Turkey who takes an interest in such things knows very well that one and a half million Armenians were brutally massacred by the Turks, men, women, and children, in cold blood. Werfel says in the introduction to his lengthy and complex novel (823 pages): 'This book was conceived in March of 1929, in the course of a stay in Damascus. The miserable sight of some maimed and famished-looking refugee children, working in a carpet factory, gave me the final impulse to snatch from the Hades of all that was, this incomprehensible destiny of the Armenian nation. The writing of the book followed between July 1932 and March 1933.' The American religious mission in the book is at Marash, and its head was the Rev. E. C. Woodley. What the novel really requires is a television series. Of course, Turkey will not permit its locations to be used, and THE PROMISE was filmed in Portugal, Spain, Malta, with a few scenes in America. The executive producer of this film was the famous billionaire film moghul and former Chairman of MGM, Kirk Kerkorian, an Armenian (1917-2015), who alas died before the film was released, aged 98. When Werfel's novel came out, Kerkorian was working as a manual labourer at MGM, a studio which he later bought and owned. Moving words by the author William Saroyan (Armenian-American) are quoted in the end titles of this film. I am glad to say that his daughter Lucy and I were close friends for a few brief months when we were young. She died much too young in 2003. Her first film role was uncredited in Karel Reisz's film ISADORA (1968), because Karel's step-daughter Kerry Kelly was her best friend and she was then (at the time I knew her) at their house nearly every day. Lucy's god-father was Marlon Brando, which became a good joke when he later actually became THE godfather. It should be remembered that not only the Armenians but also the Greeks were massacred by the Turks at this time. One of the most emotional films you could ever see deals with a Greek refugee boy from Turkey, modelled on the grandfather of Elia Kazan, who made the film: America America (1963, see my review; I slightly knew the actor who played the boy in that film). THE PROMISE briefly shows the visiting German military men who negotiated Turkey's entry into World War One on their side. It was the Kaiser's policy, based on an idea going back to the 1890s, that German interests could be served by whipping up Muslim hatred for infidels (all except for Germans, of course), and their massacre. Hitler did not originate this policy but inherited it. It was entirely under German influence that anti-Semitism took root in the Middle East, and the genocide of the Armenians inspired Hitler to commit genocide on the Jews, saying: 'Who remembers the massacre of the Armenians?' I am proud to say that my grandmother was a relentless campaigner for years for the Armenians and raised a great deal of money for the refugees during and after World War One. This film is excellently made, the direction by Terry George is superb. He also co-wrote the screenplay with Robin Swicord, and the script really is excellent. She has written many distinguished screenplays. As for Terry George, he was previously best known for writing and directing HOTEL RWANDA (2004), another powerful expose of massacre and injustice. He clearly has a social conscience worthy of an Oscar. The performances in this heart-rending story are very good indeed, with the lead young man, Mikael, played by Oscar Isaac with strength and conviction. Christian Bale once again masters the American accent to contribute a top rank performance as the American journalist who is trying to expose the genocide in the world press. The French-Canadian actress Charlotte Le Bon does not look particularly Armenian, as she should have done, but she delivers a sensitive and moving performance as Ana. Angela Sarafyan, on the other hand, who plays Maral, was born in Armenia and certainly looks it. When we see closeups of her face, we are looking at the real thing. She is now a successful American actress who has appeared in 60 films. Jean Reno appears briefly as the French admiral who saves the refugees on the beach. Tom Hollander appears as a former clown who has been imprisoned on a work gang by the Turks. This film deserves to be shown in every school all over the world, so that the truth can be known. Why should the Turks be allowed to get away any longer with hiding their dirty big secret?"

This film have to do about empires fall and so stoically and ignorantly military politics do all of their horrible actions in order to remain powerful.History cannot be erased and it remains in the heart of all those who survived from the 1.5 millions lost in the dessert, massacred, butchered, forced to abandoned their own homes and suffered so many atrocities."
" Amazing and surprisingly good movie

I think it might have something to do with a lot of the Turkish people who downgrade this movie without even watching it. I urge everyone to see this movie, mainly because of the great work of Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale who were both absolutely amazing in this movie, and also because we need to be more educated in the matter of the Armenian genocide where millions of Armenians, Syriac/Assyrians, Greeks were killed. In my honest opinion, this movie deserves 7,8 grade This movie has paved the way for other coming movies in the future about this genocide committed by the Turks"
" Armenian Genocide, among the Greek and the Assyrian one! Close to America-America! History, romance, action but I would expect it more ""dirty""!

The Armemian genocide, preceded by the Assyrian one and then followed by the Greek one is a topic that has not been touched thoroughly. America-America is another film of its kind (the first film regarding refuges), a true masterpiece. i would expected though to see it more ""dirty and less of TV series type! The only drawback!"

" Gorgeous cinematography, engaging story that kind of pulled its punches
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,10,"There have been a number of other films in recent decades that covered -- or touched on -- the Armenian Genocide by the Ottoman Turks during the early part of World War One. ""The Promise"" is beautifully set and photographed, and pretty well-acted, but definitely pulls its punches as far as depictions of gore and nudity amid the outrages that really happened back in 1914-1916 in Turkey. The combat is pretty sanitized, and the rape and mutilations of Armenian girls and women (and men, too, for that matter) basically don't exist. (I'm not a ""gore-hound"", but some events really DO deserve to be shockingly and explicitly depicted). This is a PG rendering of an X-rated horror in real history. Nevertheless, I rated it a 10 because this story deserves to be widely told, and its Muslims-slaughtering-Christians element is all too relevant to much more recent times (as if we needed to even point that out). The despicable and blatant effort of the Turkish government to down-vote this film on IMDb is another reason why I feel that people who value history should vote this film as high as possible."
" great!
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,10,"the world need to shed light on this massacre!! it's pretty sad to see people still denies it it happened, you can see Arminians all over the world when they ran from that atrocity, they ran to war famined coutries just to escape the genocide! and yet the arrogance is that they still deny it!! I believe that some people are better than some and guess who take the prize from being the worst!"

Especially if there is a love story thrown in, but I feel that in this case the love story did not make the viewers lose sight of the fact that the Armenian Genocide is the center of this film. There are many characters whose plights you will be drawn into over the course of the film. The script, cinematography, and directing were all outstanding. I am glad that there is finally a well-done film that revealed the Armenian Genocide to the wider public. I hope that in the future more people watch it and that the film makers eventually make a profit as well."

",2017-08-14 00:00:00,9,"Happily, The Promise was available through my satellite TV provider. I was drawn to the film because of its depiction of the clash between the Armenians and Ottoman Turks. And yet, the romantic thread included in the trailer was attractive as well. (A starkly historic film requires a different kind of attention; the romantic thread helps maintain an emotional bond with the characters and the story.)I found the cinematography rich and the visual representations of that time and place historically interesting and informative. (As an American, I confess being deficient in global history.) The diverse population of Constantinople before the Armenian Genocide was beautiful and cosmopolitan. Then a momentary chill is felt when German officers break out into ""Deutschland Uber Alles"" as the Turks are gearing toward their own agenda of ethnic cleansing. Terry George, director, has an even hand at conveying the violence of the time without the gory obsession of many American-made films: wounds are treated but not shown; horrific violence described but not dramatized. Even the love triangle was portrayed with maturity and restraint: the lead character is able to love two women deeply without melodrama; the bereaved men share a rare moment of sympathy in their grief.An EXCELLENT movie, and one highly recommended -- especially for American viewers -- to fill in the details of this infamous time of Southern European, Middle Eastern history. (Appropriate for middle school aged children and older.)"
" Started out disappointing, but ended well
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,7,"The general impression I was left with by ""the word on the street,"" once the movie came out, was that it did not do the story of the genocide justice, by being a bad movie production. So, my expectations coming in were low. The first hour matched my expectations. The production values were pretty good, but the movie seemed almost flippant about the story it was telling. When Mikael goes to medical school in Constantinople, he meets another medical student, Emre, who isn't really into it. He says, ""I'm more interested in female anatomy,"" nudge, nudge, wink, wink. Know what I mean?... That unfortunately characterizes the first half of the movie. It doesn't seem to have a purpose, other than to introduce the main character to a love triangle, and to establish that he is still virtuous, and that he fulfilled his promise to his village. This part of the story is delivered in a perfunctory fashion.The story comes into its own in the second hour, where the audience is gradually introduced to the Armenian genocide. This is the real reason to see the movie. It conveys the horror, and the unbelievable cruelty of a society getting rid of its undesirables. The cruelty is made doubly so by the official denial by the Ottomans that anything untoward was happening, as if they could just forget that all these people existed, and they could expect the world to turn a blind eye. For decades, Turkey succeeded in keeping the story silent, even preventing those who wanted to tell the story in the U.S. from publishing and portraying the events.There is a portrayal of a struggle between the Armenians and the Turks that reminds me a lot of the story of the Kurds in Northern Iraq in their struggles against Saddam Hussein's army.Oscar Isaac carries the movie, I would say all by himself. He is the reason to see it. He carries the weight of the story on his shoulders very well. He speaks for all those who could not speak.Despite my misgivings, solely on the merits of storytelling, I recommend seeing this movie. I felt like this story really needs something like a TV miniseries treatment to do it justice, because it was too much to fit into 2 hours. I was left with some unanswered questions as I watched it. The big one was what thought process led the Ottomans to decide to exterminate the Armenians. We know of the policy, and what they did, but I think to understand history you also have to know what motivated events, and this movie doesn't provide that backstory. How did the Ottomans think it was advantageous to carry this out? Perhaps the reason we don't know the answers to these questions is that Turkey continues its denial that these events took place. Since there is no acknowledgment, there can be no accounting for the decisions."
" Disappointing but could be better
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,3,"As a cinematography, this movie is lack of tons of aspects; characters did not fit their roles well, the script has holes and not written professionally. The movie itself is really unnecessarily long and boring. The story is true or not, the main argument stayed very weak, so it loses its documentary movie value. If you are really desperate to watch a historical movie giving most likely wrong information, go ahead and waste your time."
" The overall rating is false: it's being down-voted by genocide denialists.
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,10,"Well, screw those who would destroy History because truth hurts their feelings. The Armenian genocide happened, and whoever tries to censor this film will do so in vain, or so I hope.The movie is good, in general Oscar Isaac doesn't disappoint, and Le Bon adorably shines. That said, the crude, sad part is hard enough to watch, especially when you consider what's been shown is a mild version of what happened.It's a good movie, even though a ten is too much, I have to over-vote it to compensate for those who willingly down-vote in order to bury the truth in the sand. Worth to get to know what happened, if only because many wouldn't want you to."
" important history done badly
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,3,"It's the Ottoman Empire on the eve of WWI. Mikael Boghosian (Oscar Isaac) is an Armenian who lives in a mixed town. His family doesn't have the money to send him to study medicine in Constantinople. He makes a promise to Maral for the dowry from her father. He attends medical school with support from a wealthy uncle. He befriends Ana Khesarian (Charlotte Le Bon) and her American reporter friend Chris Myers (Christian Bale). As the war begins, his well-connected Muslim school friend Emre saves him from conscription but anti-Armenian fever sweeps over the military.This is controversial history under dispute. Veracity of true history is difficult at the best of times. This is beyond my abilities but the movie also runs into the same problem as Pearl Harbor. It's harrowing history with a romantic triangle jammed into it. This one is even a romantic quadrangle. It grinds down the start with the melodrama. His marriage is wholly unnecessary and detracts from the larger epic. There is serious history being traversed but a lot of it is convenient. This important story needs more skill, not less in story telling. The level of difficulty is high and this is nowhere close."
" Best historical movie I've seen
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,10,The Promise is a fantastic movie. Overlaying the emotional drama of a love triangle on the very real drama of the events surrounding the Armenian genocide is a great combination. The director treats the historical material with the veracity and respect it deserves while at the same time letting the successive escalation of atrocities drive the plot of the love story. I highly recommend seeing this movie both as a period love story and if you want to learn more about the sad history of the Armenian Genocide.
" Excellent movie!!!
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,10,"Excellent movie. Highly recommended. Amazing movie, so happy to have finally seen a movie regarding this dark chapter in human history. Oscar Isaac and the rest of the actors did amazing. Loved the cast. I am not Armenian. So this is a neutral review. This is a must watch movie all. This is about Armenian genocide in 1915 carried out by the young Turks. Till this days Turkish government says there..."
" Should Watch
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,5,"Not a very good movie, but an important movie to watch. These are stories that should never disappear. The Turks did to the Armenians the same thing that the Japanese did to the Chinese and the Germans did to the Jewish community. People try and deny (and hide) these atrocities that their ancestor committed out of shame (or desire to not accept), but they need to educate themselves and learn from history.I applaud Christian Bale for doing two movies that dealt with this issue - this one and Flowers of War.While this is not the greatest movie out there, I believe that I would recommend it just to have people know about this part of history."
" A very moving film- very good historical account
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,9,"Not sure why there were so many negative reviews. Perhaps the entire Turkish community is voting this film down. Rather an embarrassment for them. This depiction of one of the greatest crimes against humanity, ever committed, is a powerful tribute to a lovely people, who were persecuted mercilessly by the Turks, who found themselves on the wrong side of history, during this great war. Though the persecution started long before the atrocities committed during WWI, it was all done while labeling the Armenian traitors. Well, who would not stand up to this kind of mindlessness? Somewhere between 600,000 and 1.5 million Armenians were slaughtered, out of a total population of 2 million! Good job guys. Way to go. A resounding success. Thankfully the French Navy intervened, and saved quite a number of people. The Americas never got involved, or course, until the last year of the war. While the extent of the Ottoman Empire was, by 1914, somewhat reduced (in the past it had included large parts of North Africa, South Eastern and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and the Arabian peninsula), its territory still spanned large parts of the Middle East and Arabia, which came to be heavily affected by the First World War. It seems that part of the attempted annihilation of the Armenian people, was at least partly due to the tremendous sense of diminishment the Turks felt, by this point in time, as their empire crumbled around them. Regardless, it was inexcusable on any level. The film was very well done. Great acting, by both the lovely Charlotte LeBon, and the great actor, Oscar Isaac. And as usual, Christian Bale was amazing. The direction was excellent, as was the score, the cinematography, and the editing. This film just did not get the credit it deserved."
" So many reviews reek of denial!
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,9,"I am so glad The Promise finally brings to the screen the story of the Armenian genocide by the Turkish government during World War 1. This is a long overdue telling of a part of world history that has badly needed airing. I admit to over rating the film in order to counteract the very obvious political bias of many of the low reviews. I would actually rate it overall as an 8, (needed a bit more editing) but 10 for the topic and acting etc. It is very well worth while seeing, a good film.The statement at the end of the film that the Turkish government denies the genocide to this day is echoed heavily in many of the very low scoring reviews here on IMDb. These supposed reviews are reminiscent of a child stamping its foot and saying ""how dare you"", rather than any serious discussion of the film. It makes you worried for the future of modern Turkey when it can't accept and learn from its past history, something at least Germany, with so many more deaths on its hands, has done admirably. Perhaps the young Turkish friend of Mikael could be held up as someone to admire, he saved his friends lives at the cost of losing his own, a truly courageous act in a time of barbarity. The movie, is well written, acted and filmed. The story mainly unfolds to us from the perspective of a young Armenian man Mikael who wants to become a doctor; Oscar Isaac's performance as Mikael is wonderful, the scene where he finds his slaughtered family is incredibly moving, the display of raw, naked grief and loss its almost unbearable. Christian Bale's performance as the world weary AP reporter, is great. His character, becoming aware of the atrocities happening around him, turns from drunken cynic to courageous truth teller, revealing to the world the systematic, cruel elimination of the Armenians. Charlotte le Bon created an Ana so full of life and hope, a candle of kindness to the children in a dark place, that she was a joy to watch. I can't think of one character who didn't ring true, all were very good. I did enjoy Jean Reno's very brief appearance as the French admiral coming to the rescue.A highlight is a scene in a cathedral of a man singing which strangely to me was the most powerful moment in the whole film, I have no idea what he was singing but something beautiful and hopeful and truthful echoed in that building and in the song. Overall an emotionally draining story well told."
" It Seems to Never End
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,6,"Too much of the story was focused on the love affairs between an Armenian woman with Armenian & American men, and not enough on vast number of Armenians who died. Several films have been made of this genocide, and they all have added to its documentation. Thus, adding to a long list of genocides (or near genocides depending on definition) that have taken place since religions gained the power to kill. One wonders if the story is to be retold again with the Turks now going after the Kurds? As an aside scientific studies have shown that more people have died from religious conflict than any other single cause (Christian and Muslim faiths lead that list). Lastly, many scenes seemed overly propagandized, fictionalized to show heroic resistance. But, such is the nature of film."
" Love this movie but just for entertainment purpose
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,6,"Well i seriously love this movie acting, cinematography, action, story every thing is perfect but i also find it islamophobic, it's really like they are trying to spread hate against turk, i don't know much about Armenian Genocide maybe it's true or maybe it's just false flag even if you google it you will find lot's of conspiracy about thiis so why did they choose this subject which is not 100% true and make a full movie with this superb cast, And one thing that make me thing about all of these when i see my country flag (Pakistan) in the scene where American ambassador ask for release Mr chris from turk army headquarter . Pakistan was founded in 1947 and Armenian Genocide happened in 1915. how could they do that it's clear that they are trying show that Pakistan was also involve in this Armenian Genocide."
" Epic movie and awesome song!!!
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,10,"I knew about the movie when Chris Cornell was still working a song for it. After a few months when the movie got released, I tried to watch it but found out that the ratings were so low. I was having second thoughts if I should watch it because of the ratings but I still watched it though and realized it's such a great movie. Especially after hearing Chris Cornell's voice again. Hope everyone will enjoy it as much as we did. :)"
" Same old story..
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,2,"This film is really bad in so many ways.First of all, none of the characters have any depth to them except Christian Bale, which is quite a surprise considering his usual wooden acting; he is great in this one and really connects himself with his character. Although his very short role, Tom Hollander is also impressive and his acting successfully reflects his backstory..Secondly, it is edited very unprofessionally, Mr. George cuts camera between various focus points so fast, it is hard to even understand what he is showing. It is not easy to believe that this is the same guy who directed Hotel Rwanda. Really unbelievable. CGI background scenes were also disappointment, they look very artificial. I've honestly seen better CGI scenes in TV commercials..Thirdly, financially backed up by Armenian diaspora, script is completely based on anti-Turkish point of view. It's purely -and unquestionably- based upon Armenians' so-called ""valid"" arguments. If you look carefully you will easily see what is going on behind the scenes; Robin Swicord (screenwriter) married to an Armenian-American guy. Survival Pictures (production company) is headed by Eric Esrailian, who also dragged beloved Chris Cornell (RIP) into making a song for the movie (also, Chris's wife was Greek, which is another story!). Just connect the little dots. This Armenian Genocide subject is particularly escalated by wealthy Armenian backers since mid-70's and their attempts will continue, that's for sure. People really fell for it in the past and there is no reason to think otherwise for the future. The genocide idea is burned into the soul of the Armenian diaspora.Anyways..If you are looking for a decent movie with a good script and respectable acting, you will be disappointed as this is a biased turd with diamonds and jewels encrusted onto it. In my opinion, script is a piece of crap, but film itself looks beautiful here and there, and in general, visually appealing. But story-wise, it represents nothing new, except same old rubbish as usual..2/10"

This is Wikipedia definition for the first word that precisely describes this movie, that when cold it gives you a bad mouth sensation in the upper mouth cavity (sorry for the medical description...). This movie and ""The Ottoman Lieutenant"" belong to the same league of missing films for people that go to cinema to cry at the end ! This time with more sympathy for the Armenian side...But nothing can compare to the book ""The Forty Days of Musa Dagh"" by Franz Werfel, maybe one day somebody will take the challenge and produce a movie based on this marvelous book, despite Turkish government opposition!"
" Do not waste your time
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,2,"I am sorry to write that this movie is a propaganda piece by my government. We as Armenians watched this movie with our risen national feelings but no foreigners would find nothing in this movie.Everything from acting, directing to soundtrack sucked. SUCKED HARD.Once again, sorry for this abomination."
" I definitely agree that film critics didn't give it enough credit.
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,8,"'THE PROMISE': Four Stars (Out of Five) A historical drama set in the last years of the Ottoman Empire, right before the Armenian Genocide. It involves a love triangle between an Armenian medical student, an American journalist living in Paris, and an American-born woman raised in France. The film stars Oscar Isaac, Christian Bale and Charlotte Le Bon. It was directed by Terry George, and written by George and Robin Swicord; George has previously co-written such critically acclaimed historical dramas as 'IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER' and 'HOTEL RWANDA' (which he also directed). The film was made on a budget of $90 million, and it was completely funded by an American businessman of Armenian origin (named Kirk Kerkorian). It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it bombed at the Box Office, but the point of the movie was to bring attention to that horrific time (and place) in history (not to make money the studio says). There's also been controversy that Armenian Genocide deniers sabotaged ratings on IMDb, in an attempt to discredit the movie, and even the critics themselves have been criticized for not giving the film enough credit. I definitely agree that film critics didn't give it enough credit.Isaac plays Mikael, an apothecary living in a small Armenian village, called Sirun, in the southeast Ottoman Empire. In order to gain funds for medical school, he promises himself (in marriage) to the daughter of his neighbor. With the dowry he receives, Mikael enrolls in the Imperial Medical Academy (in Constantinople). There he befriends a Turkish classmate, named Emre (Marwan Kenzari), and an Armenian woman, who was raised in Paris, named Ana (Le Bon). Ana is dating an American reporter, for the Associated Press, named Chris Meyers (Bale). A love triangle then develops between Mikael, Ana and Chris (even though Mikael is promised to another), right before World War I breaks out (and Armenian Genocide). The three also become tragically involved in that horrific atrocity.The film is really well produced (it's budget definitely shows) and acted (especially Isaac and Bale). It's very reminiscent of classic epic war movies from years ago. The love triangle romance may seem unnecessary to some, but I don't think it was overdone at all. The movie is also really educational, for people like me at least (that don't know anything about that time in history). I think the filmmakers definitely accomplished what they set out to do with the film. It's not a 5 star masterpiece in my opinion, but it is a really good film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/226937840"
" 'But we're still here. We're still here.'
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,10,"Writer Robin Swicord (Memoirs of a Geisha, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) and Irish writer/director Terry George (In the Name of the Father, Hotel Rwanda) have created not only a factual historical presentation of the Armenian genocide but have also woven love stories in the film that draw the audience into the story, bringing sensitive credibility to the horror of 1915.In the year 1915 during the First World War, Michael (Oscar Isaac), an Armenian, who is naïve yet kind-hearted, arrives in Constantinople and meets his uncle to tell him he is going to medical school. His uncle has a wife and two daughters. The daughters have a dance instructor, Ana, (Charlotte Le Bon). Ana's father was a famous violinist who took Ana with him after her mother died when Ana was 10, to tour Europe until he left her in Paris to study at the Sorbonne. Because he was so deep in debt, he killed himself. Michael starts medical school and makes a friend with a Turk, Emre, (Marwan Kenzari) whose father is a Turkish official who is making him either go to medical school or join the army. Emre goes to medical school, even though he is ill prepared for it (he faints during an anatomy lesson when he cuts into the bowels of a corpse and stool flies onto him). Ana is being courted by an American journalist, Chris Myers (Christian Bale), who works for the Associated Press. Ana, Chris, Emre, and Michael go clubbing. Ana is nice to Michael, but the two don't seem to be in love, they just like each other. War is declared. The Turks almost get Michael to enlist into the army, but Emre, who gets a medical student exemption, pays a Turk to give Michael an exemption. Emre's father gets angry at Emre for saving his friend and warns him not to help anymore. Turks start rounding up Armenian intelligencia, and rich men in Constantinople; Chris goes to the countryside in a car with a guide, and takes pictures of a destroyed Armenian village. The men are hanged, and after leaving the village, he finds women being lead away and sees a Turk shoot an Armenian woman who had fallen down in the forced march. Michael and Ana go to Chris for help for his uncle, but he is busy reporting the Armenian massacre. They try to get Michael's uncle out of the Turks clutches with his uncle's money using Emer as an emissary. Emer's father disapproves of this and sends Emer into the army to restore his honor. Michael is arrested by the Turks. Michael's aunt and her two girls are taken in by Ana and Chris. Six months later we see Michael in a forced labor gang, building a railroad for the Turks. The Turks kill a prisoner with a broken leg that Michael and another prisoner – Tom Hollander - (a former clown) were trying to help. After killing the man, the Turkish guard wanted the two to say, ""Thank you"". And the film progresses to a stunning end.The story is very long but the acting is superb (Oscar Isaac is becoming one of the Hollywood greats) and the cast includes small but poignant roles by Shohreh Aghdashloo, Angela Sarafyan, Jean Reno, James Cromwell and others, the cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe is splendid and the musical score by Gabriel Yared is another of his finest. This is an important film that everyone should see – for all reasons."
" we must never forget
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,10,"The Armenian Genocide of 1915 is one of the forgotten moments of history. I learned about it by accident while reading a list of genocidal leaders (such as Hitler and Stalin) and it mentioned the Turks who massacred the Armenians. Indeed, Hitler was convinced that no one would remember his actions, citing the lack of attention paid to the Armenian Genocide.A movie that focused on the genocide was Atom Egoyan's ""Ararat"". Now comes ""The Promise"". Reading that the movie focuses on a relationship set against the background of the genocide, one might assume that it's a sappy love story. But it's not. It stays serious in its focus, showing how the Ottomans viewed the Armenians (some of the things that the Ottomans said about the Armenians sounded very much like what the Nazis said about Jews). The protagonist merely made a promise and sought to keep it no matter what happened. And some terrible things happened. To crown everything, the Armenians only got a small amount of territory after WWI and didn't even get access to Mt. Ararat (the Palestinians, Yazidis and Kurds didn't even get their own countries; that senseless war screwed up everything).An excellent movie. Terry George also directed the masterpieces ""Some Mother's Son"" (about the Irish Hunger Strikers) and ""Hotel Rwanda"" (about the Rwandan Genocide). Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale play roles very different from the ones with which they're most associated, with outstanding support from Charlotte Le Bon, Shohreh Aghdashloo (House of Sand and Fog), Rade erbedija (Eyes Wide Shut), Jean Reno (The Da Vinci Code) and Kevork Malikyan (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade)."
" Impressive and thought-provoking film about a love triangle set in the Ottoman empire during WWI
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,8,"Extraordinary film correctly based on real deeds and set during the last days of the Ottoman Empire . It deals with a love triangle between Mikael Boghosian , an intelligent medical student (Oscar Isaac) , the gorgeous Ana (Charlotte Le Bon) , and Chris (Christian Bale) a renowned and brilliant American journalist based in Paris . Michael gets avoid by means of bribes to be recruited in the Turkish army ; however , the happenings break out and as he escapes , hides and flees . They are accidentally trapped in violent events when their family , friends and neighbours are massacred . After WWI bursts , all get worse . It begins the horrible genocide including rampage , and ravage in Anatolia which is expanded for the East . Armenians' slaughter is executed by soldiers and government officials . The journalist Chris gets into tumult and will shoot to show it all around the world . While Michael attempts to protect his family and the unfortunate refugees . Meantime , other refugees flee toward the far frontier to find shelter and attempting to get safety in Aleppo , Syria , to survive the genocide in Turkey . ¨The Promise¨ follows a love triangle among a medical student , a sophisticated women and an prestigious American reporter . The film has an acid critic to the indolence of European nations and international community and specially , the abandon of foreign policy . Protagonist trio gives sensational performance , accompanied by a great support cast , such as Daniel Giménez Cacho , Tom Hollander , Angela Sarafyan , Alicia Borrachero , Jean Reno , Rade Serbedzija ,and James Cromwell as Ambassador Morgenthau . The movie has a colorful and evocative cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe , being filmed in 72 days across 20 locations throughout Spain , Malta, Portugal and New York. And a touching and moving musical score by Gabriel Yared . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Terry George who previoulsy made ¨In the name of the father¨ (1993) and ¨Hotel Rwanda¨ (2004)) . Terry was fully backed by the Kerkorian Foundation as well as an Armenian-American production company . Terry said : there's a difference between a perception of a story and the veracity of a story, we never wanted to dictate perception, just tell the truth . Rating : Awesome and above average . Indispensable and essential watching .The flick is based on actual events , these are the following ones : It's calculated that in the indiscriminate massacre were cruelly killed by Turks approximately 1.5 million Armenians . This brutal genocide against Armenians is called ¨Armenian Holocaust¨ that was the Ottoman government's systematic extermination of Armenians , mostly Ottoman citizens within the Ottoman Empire and its successor state, the Republic of Turkey . The starting date is conventionally held to be 24 April 1915, the day that Ottoman authorities rounded up, arrested, and deported 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders from Constantinople to the region of Ankara, the majority of whom were eventually murdered. The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly, and the infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre.Other indigenous and Christian ethnic groups such as the Assyrians and the Ottoman Greeks were similarly targeted for extermination by the Ottoman government in the Assyrian genocide and the Greek genocide, and their treatment is considered by some historians to be part of the same genocidal policy. Reports of the conflict reached then United States Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Henry Morgenthau , Sr. from Aleppo and Van, prompting him to raise the issue in person with Talaat and Enver. As he quoted to them the testimonies of his consulate officials, they justified the deportations as necessary to the conduct of the war, suggesting that complicity of the Armenians of Van with the Russian forces that had taken the city justified the persecution of all ethnic Armenians. The Armenians were marched out to the Syrian town of Deir ez-Zor and the surrounding desert. There is no evidence that the Ottoman government provided the extensive facilities and supplies that would have been necessary to sustain the life of hundreds of thousands of Armenian deportees during their forced march to the Syrian desert or after . By August 1915, The New York Times repeated an unattributed report that ""the roads and the Euphrates are strewn with corpses of exiles, and those who survive are doomed to certain death. It is a plan to exterminate the whole Armenian people"". Talaat Pasha and Djemal Pasha were completely aware that by abandoning the Armenian deportees in the desert they were condemning them to certain death . Most Armenian diaspora communities around the world came into being as a direct result of the genocide."
" Classic historical saga
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,10,"A totally absorbing love-story and historical drama-saga. The love story is poignant, believable and very moving; script and acting is brilliant. The setting and history, in 1914-1915 Armenian Turkey is fascinating and educational- history we never hear about. The panoramic cinematography and moving music adds to the exciting atmosphere. An epic wide-screen classic; it's up there with David Lean's Doctor Zhivago, Ryan's Daughter, Lawrence of Arabia, and the like. There are absolutely no faults in this classic must-see movie."

" Great story within the frame of a terrible historical event
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,10,"A great film, a great scenario, great actors. Moreover, the film approaches very directly and very faithfully the topic of the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks, and not admitted by the Turkish state so far. Beyond the tragic history of the characters involved, I think the film manages to carry along the hope the animated the Armenian survivors i.e. being good is most important, no matter how challenging the circumstances may be. The love story woven in the macro-historical narrative only shows and tells the story of so many people who drowned in history without having told their story. If you want a truly great film, and also learn about the denied history of the Armenian genocide hidden for a century, watch this film, but be prepared to cry."
" Lacking historical accuracy e.g. German empire anthem instead ""song of Germany""
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,2,"why did the German officers sing the antheme of nazi Germany?? it was the later anthem of nazi ermany instead ""the German empire anthem""(=royal anthem of prussia), of kaiser wilhelm. the kaiser was a grandson to queen victoria and the ruler of the time in Germany. after that scene, i stopped watching altogether since a lumpy script + worse direction. even the good cast couldn't save it for me"
" Decent Cinematography.. most everything else like an ""express made to fit"" Hong Kong Suit..
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,3,"I am yet to see someone make a movie (or even a book) with an objective, or at least, ""not paid for"" take on this subject. The second decade of 20th century was a very busy and most controversial one. This subject is something that still hangs over us. This really need a closure. But Closure comes through steps.. or through research and untainted productions.. As long as there are people who have the money and the will to spend $90 Mil. for some nice scenery and a slight appeasement of their own survival guilt, Hollywood would be ready to take the money and deliver. Anyways, if you have an extra couple of hours to spare and a coupon (or free streaming) then watch it. But please don't use the events in the movie to impress people with your knowledge in history.."
" Despite the facts, still not a good movie.
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,2,"As a Turk who from the very same region on this movie (A small village in Taurus Mountains), I want to add my comments on this. I heard all about the deportation from my ancestors. Also, I have relatives who helped Armenians during deportation. They provided shelter, clothes, food for them. So here my review. This movie try to tell us there was a genocide, but not a deportation. But because of absence of proof, it only uses metaphoric messages such train scene and nearby German officers. That hurt me really deeply, because these scenes fells light about real genocide happened in world war 2. I really want to producers meet with descendants of this people who lives in Lebanon and U.S.A today (which I already met with them) and ask for them for real story. I will not to try to show a scene of picnic during a world war, It was not... for both sides. First of all, the deportation was not start immediately. It was a consequence of Armenian militia actions from both east and western side of Turkey (And i have to admit, my family had suffered from actions of this militias also, murder, theft, even rape). So government decide to relocate them to inner side of anatolia and syria. Thanks to the war time shortages and fools from the Ottoman government, that relocation turned into disaster. Lots of people died from hunger, illness and cold. Some people even had to eat corpses. Remaining Turks also face to starvation and illness too during years of war. I really love to sea the real tragedy of that people on this scene. But no. It is another low quality propaganda movie which try to tell a love story also, looks like glued into script. Acting and some scenes were good. Geographic reanimation was very well. So I gave 2 stars. Because, the rest of the movie was boring. stereotypical, orientalist and inaccurate. By the way, I also don't like Ottoman Letaunant. It is just another tailored movie like this. I am still waiting a real epic movie about this events."
" Exceptional movie
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie is really extremely good and moving. It is a real masterpiece. Tough man as I thought or tries to be I cried more than once, all along the movie and it didn't happen for me in many years. You will dive in the armenian tragedy, in a truly beautiful love story and also meet the very noble characters displayed in the movie. This movie is a lesson at many levels, humanity, history, ethics. The actors are top great and they make this movie a courageous masterpiece. The movie is also very diplomatic concerning the underlaying religious aspect of the story, but those who know will understand what was/is at stake... One last note : thank you to the french and Americans who historically were there when needed most in that (true) story: May it be a lesson for today. PS.: I am not armenian..."
" A film that could tell all the story but never did!
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,4,"As a Greek with forefathers that fled Turkey at that period (my great grandmother died on the way and my great grandfather reached with two sons Greece in order to survive the genocide i can only state that its at least frustrating to watch this movie. Truth is that not once in this movie the word Greek assyrian or pontogreek is mentioned.I understand to the core all Armenians but the genocide is not theirs only neither the many films we watched about Jewish persecution.So i can only say people responsible for making this movie were too arrogant to mention once the 1.2 million Greek souls out of the 4 million in total that were either massacered or died on their effort to escape.Another historical fact is that the Jewish genocide along with the Armenian genocide were almost imediatly recognized by the world community where the Greek genocide procedure went very slowly due to political games of the superpowers. Another fact is that the superpowers of the time left the population of the three major micrasia cities to die in the harbour and did not rescue them with any boats or vessels and the ones reached the ships were thrown overboard. To the dear Armenians that supported this film or had ""fun"" watching it i can only state:Brothers do not be so arrogant about your heritage because by this movie you do not look better than a Turk holding an Armenian head.The Genocide is not only yours to sell or brag about!"
" incomplete movie
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,6,"I watched this movie recently with high expectations as I heard that it was top notch. I was disappointed - while its beginning is quite engaging and the story is of interest, it seems to me that the Script was focused too much on attempting to demonstrate the Armenian Genocide rather than tell the story of the people involved. All possible ""evil"" behaviors were shown such as work camps, railway wagon full of refugees, people beaten/killed in the streets ... It seemed far fetched to me. It seems like only Armenians were ""on the road"" at that time as the heroes only met ""poor"" Armenians and ""bad"" Turks. While Ottomans were a mix of Turks, Kurds and Arabs - focus is again on Turks only. Historically speaking, it is known that most murders were done by Irregular Troops. Having said that, one might say that this is not a documentary so inaccuracies may occur - but then this approach has made the film too much one sided. Not to mention the American behavior (journalist + ambassador) which is the usual ""we Americans do not accept this ..."" ... this came out as funny and removed credibility. I liked the male lead as he played well his role. He was one of the few strong points of the movie. One low point is for the ridiculous behavior of the leading Lady - imagine back in 1914, a lady sleeps with an American who is a drunk and goes around in bars with him, and is still deemed as honest and worthy to wed the main hero .... sorry, it does not make sense. Maybe for 2014 but not for 1914. So all in all - nice beginning, beautiful cinematography but then it tumbles as it wants to say too much and gets lost on the way. A weak version of Doctor Zhivago. Unfortunate ... Watch it once but do not buy it."
" This is why you don't close your forums IMDb

" Great Movie
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,8,"This is a great movie that deserves a higher rating on IMDb. Having watched The Promise, I now know more about the Armenian genocide. A good historical movie like this one can enable people to have a better understanding of historical events. I did a little research after watching it and it turns out what is shown is historically accurate, including the forced march of the Armenian people into the desert and the involvement of French marines.The acting, direction and cinematography are excellent. Christian Bale is one of the best of his generation. Charlotte Le Bon and Chris Isaac performed very well, and it was nice to see quality actors in supporting roles, such as Jean Reno as the captain of the French ship and James Cromwell as the American ambassador.It's sad that more people didn't go to see it, they wouldn't have been disappointed and they would have had an important history lesson."
" The Vidiot Reviews...
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,6,"The PromiseDating during wartime is hard since most of the restaurants and theaters are rubble.However, the couples in this drama have been able to find love amid a holocaust.On the eve of WWI an Armenian medical student (Oscar Isaac) studying in Constantinople manages to evade conscription in the Ottoman army long enough to fall in love with a Paris raised Armenian (Charlotte Le Bon). Unfortunately, she is betrothed to an American newsman (Christian Bale) and he is promised to a neighbour's daughter.All four lives collide in the aftermath of the Great War, during Turkey's systematic slaughter of the Armenian people. The Promise is a well-acted piece of historical storytelling that doesn't manipulate the facts of the Armenian Genocide for the sake of fiction. Unfortunately, the awkward love triangle only distracts from the enormity of the massacre.Fortunately with post-war breakups, you have your wife stateside to console you.

",2017-07-10 00:00:00,10,"An excellent film, a great acting game. I looked with pain in my heart. The events that took place in the Ottoman Empire are briefly and clearly shown.

" educational while entertaining
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,10,"Wonderful movie with a great story line. As an Armenian, I'm very grateful to see this film get as big as it did, the cast deserves two thumbs up and our ancestors deserve the recognition. Any bad ratings is most probably from Turkish deniers. They do this all the time causing our story more difficult to hear. Thank you the promise cast!! Thank you x a million!"
" Outstanding
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,10,"Armenian Genocide Outstanding movie which is both a Love Story, plus Drama. Had no idea of the extent of this WWI history, most know of WWI and the Gallipoli Campaign this gives one a different look at the role the Turks acted and performed.Well played and lot of drama and action.Insight: In 1915, leaders of the Turkish government set in motion a plan to expel and massacre Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire. Though reports vary, most sources agree that there were about 2 million Armenians in the Ottoman Empire at the time of the massacre. By the early 1920s, when the massacres and deportations finally ended, some 1.5 million of Turkey's Armenians were dead, with many more forcibly removed from the country. Today, most historians call this event a genocide–a premeditated and systematic campaign to exterminate an entire people. However, the Turkish government does not acknowledge the enormity or scope of these events. Despite pressure from Armenians and social justice advocates throughout the world, it is still illegal in Turkey to talk about what happened to Armenians during this era."

" Overrated
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,4,"I think this is a very over rated movie. Every couple of years a genoicide remembrance movie is released and I'm sorry to say but most of them are terrible , this is not one those terrible ones but I wouldn't rate it more than 5 . Anyway , I believe these kind of movies are made because the so called genoicide is still debated and there is no firm evidence that it occurred, numbers and reasons are usually a big lie. Watch it if you have free time , but learn your facts from historians not from movies. Peace to you all."
" Must know story but boring
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,4,"The movie was one of the slowest I've sen in a long time, the story is something one should be educated about however the execution is poor. Christian bale walks through the movie as this is not a stretch for him, Isaac does the job but a lot of the background people can be seen quite relaxed and not going through the reality of the situation making it distracting."
" The Promise : Empire attempt to wipe an entire nation
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,7,"In the last few weeks before the release of the movie worldwide and Lebanon, there was a lot of discussions how the movie through ratings via IMDb & Rotten Tomatoes being hijacked by thousand of reviewers through very low ratings with the majority not writing a single note on the movie. For the reason mentioned and the fact that I was invited by AFHIL (Armenian Fund For Health Insurance in Lebanon) through a friend, I had to go and judge for myself.Usually, I care a lot about ratings but this time I had to ignore because the movie wasn't given chance and in my mind, because I understood that this act by Turkish influenced reviewers is a second attempt to diminish importance of what happened 102 years ago & erase a nation's right from the history books. So I was not deterred by 4/10 rating or the rotten status on both mentioned sites. In an approximately 2 hours 10 minutes, there was not a second of boredom in the film. I will go into little deeply & briefly in explaining certain aspects of making a good film. In any film especially a feature film there're few things that complement each other without one the movie is a failure. In the case of ""The Promise"" had the storytelling attributes & a well struck script, the director who is the project manager of this feature was in control & in my opinion he excelled, the cast was almost flawless although Christian Bale had by far had better roles from the Batman series, American psycho, and other parts nevertheless he was on top of his game. Oscar Isaac portrayal of the Armenian living under the Turkish rule was overwhelming and authentic, especially during his emotional outburst while witnessing the tragedy of his people and family. Charlotte LeBon as an actress was new to me but she as well nailed in her performance. The production from small details to the biggest either makes it or break it and here they were spot on. At the end of the day, it's a dramatic love story with historical influences and no matter what you do someone will criticize. The most important elements to a good movie were evident the story, cast, production, directing, & crew. Would I say it's a masterpiece? No, but it's a movie I recommend everyone to watch, open their heart & eyes to fully grasp this major production that highlights an important & tragic part in the history of the Armenian nation and Armenians scattered all over the world because the aggression of an arrogant empire and until our days the same entity is not even conceding of the atrocities occurred by their predecessors."
" Superb in every way - a must watch
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,10,"I can't recommend this movie highly enough. It is superb. The filming, the sweep of the well paced story, the terror and heartbreak along the way to the nail biting beach scene at the end are just thrilling and devastating at the same time. The Armenian genocide in Turkey during WWI is the setting for this terrific movie as it follows several Armenians and an American reporter through the events of 1914-1915.The production values are top notch with stunning scenery and opulent sets and a cast of many. Even though it wasn't filmed in Turkey it looks fine.Oscar Isaac is Oscar worthy. He is such a moving actor - never overacting but completely convincing. He can play so many different races and characters. Charlotte le Bon isn't perfectly beautiful but she looks right in the period role. Christian Bale - kudos to him for acting in these kinds of movies like the Nanjing massacre movie a few years ago.The love triangle is actually not irritating - it isn't clichéd so it doesn't distract from the story too much.It's tragic that a meaningful well made movie like this wasn't successful in the box office - most people would rather see some super hero movie than this unfortunately.It's so good that movies like these are made. Many major powers have committed genocide or atrocities and their people shouldn't be upset if a movie is made about it many years later. Whether it is the British in India and China, French in Indochina, Dutch in Indonesia, Belgians in the Congo the list goes on, audiences need to watch these movies and encourage studios to make them.One of the best movies about genocide ever made."
" Incredible
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,10,"The Promise was finally released in Australia this week, almost 2 months after its release in the US and Europe.The movie depicts the horrors committed by Ottoman Turkey to its own citizens, in this case, the Armenians. The Promise begins with a Constantinople that is modern, multicultural, and multi faith (the Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians are Christian) and shows it's decline as the country begins its ""purification"" and ethnic cleansing under the guise of the Great War.The movie accurately depicts a painful and dark time in history and shows inhumanity as well as resilience and triumphant strength of the human spirit. The performances were nuanced and powerful. Oscar Isaac, Bale, Angela Safaryan, Charlotte Le Bon, Shohreh Aghdashloo (as Mikhael's mother) and Marwan Kenzari as the Turkish officer yet loyal friend of Mikhael were all magnificent.Amazing cinematography and music by the late Chris Cornell, this movie is a must see for all.It is sad, that to this day, Turkey refuses to acknowledge and take accountability for this dark chapter In history."
" Beautiful and cruel story of love and war, like the great writers tell us about
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,10,"I was very moved by this story of the Armenians who were suddenly object of hate and destruction, without knowing why. I loved to be taken into this rich, colorful culture, with lots of authentic details and of course many own traditions. The movie was very well of casting and completely convincing, without making abuse of sentiments. It was the ripe fruit of people in diaspora, who manage to tell about their ancestors being such victims, with such pain, without forcing us to chose any side of the issue. A great human document. It was also about love and connection, about promises and responsibility, which made the movie adult-level for the soul. Who would have such dignity in times of war as most of these people, on all sides of the matter? I'm sure some people will rate this movie lower as it should be, because this still is a political issue. I'm not involved, but I'm in love with this story and that's why I gave it a rate of 10. It must be taken care of!"
" The perfect balance of romance and historical events
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,9,"RATE: 9.5/10I found this film to be highly under-rated on many websites and even IMDb. I did not see the reason why. There are basically two major lines in the picture: the romantic story and the historical drama. The romance is basically taking place in the war surroundings with all its ugliness and unjustified losses. The film is not only about the particular time in history and not about the geography where it takes place nor it is about the local war between Turkish and Armenian people. I see the greater value in such pictures. They tackle the problems of many nations that have been manipulated into such wars. But let's start from the beginning. There are my key thoughts after watching the film:the cast was brilliant and was so much above any average acting, although there were a couple of episodes that were week and fell through (which was in fact taking the whole picture in account a rather small ""forfeiture"" ). I just thought if there was Leonardo DiCaprio playing together with any actress it of course would deserve much more appraisal but handsome and talented Oscar Isaac (Mikael) deserves much more attention that is given to him by the critics. The female part was played amazingly well by Charlotte Le Bon. The rest of the crew was also very well selected and suitable for the parts they were depictured in. the story line was very well developed and even (balanced considering different aspects of it). why do we have to choose which side to take: Armenian or Turkish. In war there is no sides. Do we Russians have to hate all Germans because they burnt my grandparents live in 1942 from my father's side and killed my grandfather from my mum's side? For the people who know the nature of all wars such question does not exist. Not the people and nations should be guilty for the war crimes but the governors and those whom they listen to starting such wars. If you kill a person you get to jail. If the war general kills thousands of people he gets a golden badge. There is no logic in this. The orders to kill should be punished not the nations who fight again each other. Do we still have to hate each other for what one or two people are responsible in the past. May be it is their aim: separation is a great daughter of many crimes. Proclaim the war between brothers and while they fight you can have all their goods and possessions. They will be hating each other for years after such wars and will forget about what was really taken from them. You can not punish the nation by hating its people. There is no sense in such feelings and they are simply a waste and time lost on something insignificant. Rather we should do everything to vote for the leaders who create peace and love.the majority of wars taking place are the religious wars: they are easy to control via propaganda and mind manipulation by the governors who start such wars. Wars are a very profitable business. Just think about it... So many people who just want to work for a plate of food for their families... a bit of history: Ottoman Empire entered the WWI in November 1914 . In October 1914 Turkish troops provoked the Russian Army (Black Sea region) following the orders and advises of the British Empire by shooting the major Russian sea ports. As a result Russians proclaimed a war with Turkey in Nov 1914. The territories Turks were targeting were the remote Armenian villages in the region that belonged at the time to the Russian Empire. Some of Armenian villages were located on Turkish lands. The conflict was unavoidable. The Antanta countries (including France) were trying to evacuate the peaceful settlers from the Turkish territories. Th Turks were afraid the Armenians would be opposing them and would support the Russian army. The genocide actions took the lives of 1.5 mln Armenians mainly civilians (Eastern Anatolia). This was part of the war to get the very taste of the Russian treasure cake: famous Russian Sea access (Black Sea). Many Turks still feel ashamed by the actions on their government but it is not officially acknowledged. Acknowledgement would mean the secret documents to surface and they would reveal who was who in that war. The shadow figures never like to be in the light. The Turkish Army was conquered in 1916 and the Osman Empire so well supported by the forces from the West was destroyed. If we choose to close our eyes on the events taken place we should then close our eyes on the war between Russian and Ukraine, where shamefully brothers and literally fighting brothers. -when you watch the film please pay attention to the soundtrack - I personally adore the duduk (woodwind flute made of apricot wood) - we say the orange sun signs through this instrument. ​ - the film is also well balanced in the sense of showing the right amount of battle scenes that beautifully interacted with the romantic ones - nothing is missing, nothing is over-done.The film is no less valuable than Titanic (that was my comparison to the love story) and no less valuable than Gone With The Wind (that was my comparison with the war related movies) and deserves a much better recognition than it currently has."
" Surprisingly Breathtaking Drama that has been Underlooked,
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,8,"The Promise is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is a widely unknown film that no one has really heard of or talked about, I just happened to stumble upon a trailer one day and decided to give it a look, I was not regretful of my decision. It is a powerful drama, based on the true story of how the Turkish government essentially tried to erase the entire Armenian empire during the First World War. I was shook to learn of this story and see how little attention these events received.The least effective part of the story was the love triangle, I did not care very much for it, as I was more intrigued by the real events in this movie and not something the writers were making up for added effect. It simply made Mikael less likable, which should not have been a goal if he is the main character who we are meant to follow along on this journey, and seeing him be so encouraging of adultery was out of character. The cast is phenomenal, Oscar Isaac shines in the lead role, further displaying the versatility and range he has as an actor. Christian Bale is also stellar as Chris Myers, eloquently conveying this characters conflicting emotions throughout these traumas, he steals the show once again in a supporting role. It is a powerful drama that should be watched if you discover its existence. Well acted and engaging, The Promise is well worth the watch if you are looking for a good drama. Follows two men who forget their differences with one another to fight for the survival of the Armenian Empire. Best Performance: Christian Bale"
" A surprisingly good movie
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,8,"The Promise A classic Hollywood-style production, the work of Irish film-maker Terry George (In The Name Of The Father, 1993). The film concerns an as yet untouched subject: the Armenian genocide of 1915, perpetrated by the Ottoman Empire, even today still unrecognized by Turkey. The first part of the film is all optimism, friendship, sunlight, dancing. Young Mikael Boghosian, apothecary in the Armenian town of Siroun dreams of becoming a doctor. He is betrothed to a local girl (Maral) and uses the dowry to enroll in medical school in Constantinople, promising to return within two years to marry Maral and set up his practice in his home town. In Constantinople he stays with his uncle Mesrob, a prosperous merchant prominent within the Armenian community. Mikael excels in medical school, enjoys living in his uncle's comfortable home, and meets the beautiful Ana Khesarian, governess to Mesrob's two daughters. Mikael becomes friends with a fellow medical student, Emre Ogan, son of an important Turkish aristocrat, and meets Chris Myers of Associated Press. Then comes the threatening presence of the German military, the beginning of World War I. A radical change of mood, all menace, darkness, scenes reminiscent of the infamous ""Kristallnacht"" of 1938, with Armenian properties and homes smashed and looted. Armenian citizens are rounded up and marched off to camps, Mikael included. After all manner of hardships he escapes, returns to his home town, finally joining the tides of refugees trudging through the countryside in search of safety. This is a film about heartbreak, death camps, massacres, genocide  and refugees: very relevant in these days when the world finds itself in the midst of a refugee crisis as bad or worse than the aftermath of World War II. We march with them, witnessing their solidarity, compassion and unity. Refugees of a hundred years ago, not so very different from refugees in the second decade of the 21st century. It is also a tale of love, an amorous triangle between Mikael, Ana and Chris Myers, well-known journalist and war correspondent. In sum, a brave, well-intentioned film portraying a dark episode of history. The filming is restrained, sober, this is not a gory movie  most of the bloodshed and violence occur off screen, or at least mid-shot. The actors are all very good in their roles. Christian Bale is particularly good as Chris Myers, hard drinking, brash, in love with Ana and pivotal in helping the Armenian refugees escape to the sea where they are rescued by the French Navy. Charlotte Le Bron is Ana, who transforms from being a beautiful, sophisticated, fun-loving, young girl to a brave, resilient young woman, caring for a group of orphans in their flight towards the sea. Mikael Boghasian is played effectively by Oscar Isaac, a monumental performance as he is in practically all the scenes of the film. Then, Jean Reno appears briefly as Captain of the French vessel which picks up the refugees, saving as many as possible from Turkish gunfire."
" Deeply emotional
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,10,"Sitting with many Armenians and Assyrians watching the movie, feeling the deep sorrow of every individual, make this film a deep emotional event.The scenes are very chocking in the cinematic language. Yes heavily digital backgrounds and Ottoman armies and cities, but surprisingly the characters are full of personality and strong acting.For those who for politically reasons deny the massacres under the Ottoman regime must ask themselves and think about it: Why many Armenian and Assyrian societies are scattered over Europe and North America. There is a reason for this and is still on the same track so far.Watch this film and dive in history and fine film making."
" Skillful movie balancing a love story and a documentary
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,9,"Many would expect a documentary on the 1915 genocide on christians in the Ottoman Empire. The audience would ask how the genocide could pass by so unnoticed and why it is necessary to remind the world through a Hollywood-movie.However, this is more focused on the love story between a woman and two men fighting for her attention. One story that is hard to predict how it will end and it ended surprisingly - for which a better ending could have been wished for.Christian Bale is superb in his role as the American journalist reporting about the genocide to the world. He is skillfully balancing between the loving man and a drunkard journalist. He does it so well one forgets who is the main character. The photo scenes are excellent material.All over, a movie well worth seeing and a love story that entangles."
" The Promise Exposes Turkish Genocide Against Armenians
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie April 2017 at a preview screening with the director at the Washington DC Capitol. It exposes the rounding up, deportations, and killings of Armenians which Turkey denies to this day. I cried start to finish because every event reminded me so much of the Yezidi genocide of August 2014 in Shingal, Iraq, against 400,000 Yezidis. The Turks have mounted a media campaign to smear this movie. 100,000 people gave it low ratings even before it opened in movie theaters. Please see it, rate it high, and share it. Turkey's denial must be exposed."
" The low star qualification is evidence of theist hypocrisy
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,10,"1 more time, theism AKA religion, has proved to be the cowards that they are facing reality, not all but are liars and dishonest but the blind belief in Allah without any or bad evidence is dishonest so they lie to themselves at least in this, and killing 1,500,000+ Armenians for this belief, and then try to lie saying that it didn't happen, it's just the same pattern of denial as their religion, they did something so horrible they don't want anything to do with it to save face, and they won't even recognize this denial pattern, so they deny their denial, they're completely voluntarily blind about it. This kind of behavior are promoted by some Islamic authorities by sending healthy young men and military even, into European Countries, to repeat so hypocritically the same things to prove that their god is blessing them with conquer, that's the real danger of letting Muslims get inside of any non-Muslim Country; some Muslims may say that's not Islam, or not the modern version of it, but there isn't any modern Islam, fundamentalists push that people follow strictly to a extreme what the ""perfect"" word of god in the Qur'an says, honest Muslims and reasonable people, some ex-Muslims, say that ISIS and Al-Qaeda aren't being bad Muslims but good ones because they're following the Qur'an intention; this film shows this in a exemplary way.This film got 3 screenings, and the next day had 55,126 1-star ratings on IMDb, that's clearly a boycott by Turkish people, probably authorities, which are probably also religious authorities at least some of them, as most Muslims countries have Theocratic Islamic States, but we know how hypocritical they are and so I voted 10 as 80,869 others as a protest to this infamous coward Muslim act, oppressing and then lying to the World, for the millionth time. Until Muslims don't change their religion enough so they can interact with people without that xenophobic attitude of honor killings or throwing acid to women face, just for trying to marry a non-Muslim or reject their marriage proposal, barbaric uncivilized ignorant inhumane behavior, they shouldn't be allowed entering in any non-Islamic Country; but they want other Countries to respect it, to allow closed colonies of Muslims, like the 2,000,000+ million in Germany, rejecting cultures and being fanatics of their own and their religion, if so then go to your Muslim Countries and stay there, why you come to the ""decadent"" Countries for a better way of life? your god doesn't bless you in your own holy Muslim ones?I know this is critic to Islam too, but somebody had to say it if none have already, and I should be allowed to do so, since the unfair critic to this film have open a political statement door that I'm simply using as many have done so before me to favor or go against it."
" Movie Rating ?
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,10,"I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating on IMDb. I almost didn't see this movie because of the low rating, but I'm glad I went and saw it anyway. I saw another post that mentioned that the movie had received tons of negative reviews before it was even released. I am not one to usually shout conspiracy, but something is off with the rating. I know that the Turkish government still does not admit that these atrocities occurred. If this was some sort of sabotage, to give the movie low ratings, then shame on them. Go see this movie, incredible performances by Oscar Isaac and Bale. It had very good filming right from the start. Also I think the amount of action and fighting in the movie was depicted well, but not overdone like some of the bloodbaths we see in movies. Great movie overall and ignore the low rating."
" ""The Promise"" (Terry George, 2016) Points of view from both sides of this tragic piece of history
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,7,"It's a political hot-potato between Turkey and the rest of the world. There have been quite a number of films about these same events, many of them made by Armenians. Recently leading international directors have joined the Armenian, Atom Egoyan (""Ararat""). The Taviani Brothers (Italy) made ""The Lark Farm"", and Turkish- German director Faith Akin, made ""The Cut"". Now an Irishman, Terry George has given us ""The Promise"". In the first years of the First World War, the Turks entered the war on the side of the Germans and thereby made enemies of the nations that had formerly been long term friends of the Ottomans. The choice led them into a tragic war which included an attack on their own Western shores, by the Allies, and on their Eastern borders, by Russia. The director/co-screen-writer, has attempted to tell the Armenians' truth, but the truth is far more complex than shown here. The Armenian people had lived among the Turks for the entire history of the Ottoman Empire (600 years) as friends and good citizens. The situation prevailing in Turkey at the time was incredibly 'byzantine' (to use an appropriate word in it's modern expression. From 1894 to 1920 the Armenians had been fighting against the Turks, as separatists. (The Armenian Revolt 1894-96.) Terry George's ""Hotel Rwanda"" is also about genocide, and there is dialogue in ""The Promise"", reminding us, of a later genocide. Talaat Pasha, Minister of the Interior, is speaking to the American Ambassador, and reminds him that he is a Jew, and asks him why he is so interested in the fate of the Christian Armenians. The scenes between the American Ambassador Henry Morgenthau and Talaat Pasha actually happened, and are reported in Morgenthau's book. Morgenthau also wrote that Enver Pasha told him at the time that he had warned the Armenian Patriarch at the start of Turkey's participation in World War One, that if they attempted to start a revolution again, or help the Russians, he'd be unable to save them. He then referred to their taking of the city of Van and bombing and killing there, this while Turkey was fighting for its life in the Dardanelles.""We cannot permit people in our own country to attack us in the back,"" said Enver Pasha. ""The Promise"" is woven around a love story between an Armenian couple who meet in Istanbul, during the days just before the Turks enter the First World War on what turned out to be the losing side. The story-telling is rather one-sided, however, does try to tell us through one character only, that there were also Turks who cared about the Armenians. In attempting not to sensationalize the telling of the story, the director has made a film in which we are kept at arm's length emotionally, while the terrible tale unfolds. We never feel the grief in the way that Steven Spielberg made us feel, when watching ""Schindler's List, for example. Shot mainly in Sintra, and Lisbon, Portugal and seemingly using CGI backdrops to show Istanbul views across the Bosphorus, it comes to us in a filtered golden light. Oscar Isaac is a fine actor playing Mikhael Boghosian. Christian Bale, plays an American journalist from Associated Press witnessing and reporting the events. (There actually was an American journalist there, named Damon Theron.) Charlotte Le Bon plays the Paris educated Armenian nanny who is in a relationship with the American journalist. She is now working in Istanbul with a family to whom she is related. If you look on IMDb.com you will see some interesting facts. This film had its world premiere at TIFF 2016. The director and lead actors were there and the audience was told that there were 1400 seats at the first screenings and yet already there were 4,000 negative reviews on IMDb. One month later a viewer wrote that 4 or 5 months later there were 84,000 negative reviews for this film that hadn't yet had a general distribution opening.Thanks to Trump's spokeswoman for the useful expression, 'Alternative facts', which unfortunately have always existed, and always will, as both sides write their version, and fail to mention or recognize the motives of the other. However, it seems clear to me that there was a deliberate action by the Turks to destroy the Armenians. They just don't like the word 'genocide'. However that's what it adds up to. It was horrific, but they did have strong reasons. They couldn't subdue the Armenians, and they couldn't allow them to continue with what they were doing. It's time for all the facts to be revealed, and accepted, and everyone to admit their crimes, and express sorrow for them too. Over one hundred years have passed.Unfortunately this film doesn't tell us anything about the reasons the Turks had in mind, (perhaps there is just no time in a film already over 2 hours long), however these reasons were told to Ambassador Morgenthau, by Enver Pasha (Minister of War) and this is what the Ambassador recorded:1. ""They have enriched themselves at the expense of the Turks. 2. They are determined to domineer over us and to establish a separate state. 3. They have openly encouraged our enemies, assisted the Russians in the Caucasus, and our failure there is largely explained by their actions. 4. Three-quarters of them are already disposed of, and now there's such hatred that we must finish the job or they'll plan their revenge. 5. We are involved in a war for our survival in the Western part of Turkey, and we have no time to deal with the Armenians at the same time.""Have we learned ANYTHING yet? It doesn't look like it, glancing across to the Middle East today.""The Promise"" is that the Armenians, and their culture and their memories must survive. More power to them, I wish them well."
" Clearly an actors' movie and can be appreciated even if you don't care about history
",2017-05-17 00:00:00,7,"What madness is this? I just arrived from cinema and although the summer season has begun they showed me a movie which is not:  some random French or Russian comedy,  a sequel,  a prequel or at least origin story  an animation,  based on YA novel or comic book  based on a novel or non-fiction book or some older movie  there's not even any superheroes or mutants in it, ferchrissake! Set during the last days of the Ottoman Empire and their attempt to wipe out as many Armenian people as they can, at its heart there is a love story – two guys (Oscar Isaac, Christian Bale) want the same girl (Charlotte Le Bon). The Turkish government would never allow a movie like this to be filmed on their home territory – it's said that the Turks have never acknowledged the genocide or their role in it. So it was all filmed in Spain, Malta, Portugal and USA. It has a big budget of 90 million USD and that money is well spent. The movie as a whole looks old- fashioned in a good way: majestic and poetic, also a bit nostalgic for the past simpler times"". The story is also old-fashioned in a good way, which is to say the approach is populist – clearly black and white, we always know who the good and the bad guys are and nobody's choices are never questioned in broader context. But this kind of approach is not a problem when we have three leading thespians so able as Isaac, Bale and Le Bon. They put every nuance of the material to efficient use. ""The Promise"" is clearly an actors' movie and that's how it can be appreciated even if you personally do not care about that part of history. Some of the scenes with strongest dramatical impact are done even shortly and without any words, just a quick look, pause, and they move on. The Project"" never dwells long on anything happening on screen, there's so much story to give and absorb in the 132 minutes it has. And yet thanks to competent direction and superb actors, it never feels rushed, there's always enough room for important things and people in the context of the story. I especially like the action scenes which are actually pretty small in scope, compared to most war dramas produced today, but it never feel that way. The suspense and danger surrounding the main characters is always real. I am not trying to step on anyone's feelings and underplay the seriousness of the genocide, but it can be said that the century-old suffering of Armenians is not the most well-known of historical tragedies, especially to the general English-speaking audience the movie is produced for. So having a big budget that enormous seems kind of risky. Luckily for the people involved, the project was fully financed by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian of Armenian extraction whose family had lived through the events depicted in the movie, and all the proceeds will go to nonprofits (ie, charity). A fun IMDb fact to end with. The Promise"" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival last September, but before the audience even left the theater, reviewers suspected to be Turkish government- sponsored trolls had submitted ca 4,000 negative ratings. That number quickly multiplied before the movie was released. Maybe that's why the IMDb score is pretty low, 5.9/10. All in all, it's a competent and confident movie from all involved. Even the main man behind the screen, the co-writer and director Terry George is not randomly chosen. His earlier magnum opus is acclaimed and Oscar-nominated Hotel Rwanda"" (2004) about mass murder of Tutsi people in 1990's Africa. So it's like his second shot at the epic making glory in Hollywood. Here's hope the movie doesn't disappear unnoticed although not having superheroes or even mutants is clearly a misstep!"
" An Epic, but Unfortunately True, Account of the Armenian Genocide
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,10,"The significance of The Promise is that it is a full presentation of the Armenian Genocide, a first.The story looks at four individuals — an American journalist (Christian Bale), who vies against a Turkish Armenian who simply wants to be a country doctor (Oscar Isaac), for the attention of an Armenian woman educated in France (Charlotte le Bon), the three of them friends with a Turkish officer (Numan Acar) — against the turbulent events of the downfall of the Ottoman Empire, leading to the establishment of the State of Turkish. The story effectively and compellingly weaves their lives through the genocide of the Armenian peoples. These four lives is probably artistic license. This movie however is not intended to be a documentary. While these characters are fiction, the way their lives intersect with the historical facts are believable and credible. The production values of The Promise are high, with painstaking detail taking you back to time of the genocide, and the acting and direction top notch. I did not find the story of the main characters' interlaced lives ""sappy"" by a long shot, nor was the narrative of the events in the genocide unnecessarily polemical, preachy, or propagandistic. Let me put it another way. I've seen worse movies in this respect about the Jewish holocaust.FULL DISCLOSURE: This reviewer is Greek American, and we have our own complicated history with Turkey. Shortly after the Armenian genocide, in 1922, Turkish armed forces slaughtered, and then forcibly ejected ethnic Greek communities which had lived on the shore of Asia Minor for over two thousand years. Approximately 200,000 ethnic Greeks were killed, and the rest were kicked out of Turkey. Not only that, but this reviewer lives in Fresno, California, which hosts the greatest concentration of Armenians outside of Armenia.This however has not colored my assessment of this movie. It is an effective movie. It has an epic feel to it and will move the viewer simply on account of the human drama it portrays. I imagine the only viewers who downplay this movie are those knuckleheads who still deny, as official Turkish policy does to this day, that any Armenians were killed at all."
" The Promise
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,10,"The Promise was a wonderful film, finely acted and unquestionably understated as to the actual events. That was wise, since to many, this is but their first introduction to the atrocities that were to become the model for Hitler's Holocaust and the first genocide of this century. The heinous need to prevent the truths of the barbaric massacres of the Armenian people from being told, only insults the memory and the suffering of a people. As one who has heard the stories first hand and who has studied the historical records of figures such as Henry Morgenthau and others who witnessed these events, I promise you, the movie was mild in its depiction of the occurrences as they really happened. That is fine, for the most important message is that the story is being told at all, that someone has had the courage to stand up and say ""Yes, this happened."" That is the power and the glory of this movie, above the love story, above all else. This movie need not be looked at as a degradation of the Turkish people, in fact one of the true heroes of the story, was a Turk, who ended up being shot for helping to save his friend. And there were Turks who did not join the frenzy, but did indeed help their Armenian friends to escape, just as there were Germans who hid the Jews. The difference here is in the denial. The denial and indifference that leads to a continuation of such horrific misdeeds throughout history. Some say, ""Why not forgive,"" and I don't disagree; but how can one forgive when no one has said ""We're sorry, we were wrong, this will not happen again."" You can't forgive someone who is not sorry. No one says forget the Holocaust, yet it is within the realm of reason that it might never have happened had the world not turned their backs on the Armenian people and set a precedent for genocide in this century. As Hitler said, ""Who remembers the Armenians?"" I say, ""We do."" Thank you to the director, the actors, the producers and all who made this film a reality."
" Heart-wrenching!
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,10,This movie was beautifully shot and written. It's a very truthful synopsis of the Armenian genocide. Finally this tragedy is brought to the screen and getting the attention it deserves. The Turkish government has once again failed to silence the Armenians and the internet trolls with their low ratings (even before the film was released!) were not able to stop this film from being successful. Well done and thank you to all those involved in the making of The Promise.
" A powerful enjoyable Film
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,10,"Armenian genocide was one of the most horrendous massacres that happened last century but to this day Hollywood,Media and many countries don't like to talk about the subject out of the fear of offending Turkey . This movie is engaging ,thrilling and mostly historically accurate I recommend everyone to watch it"
" Will become a classic -- similar in scope and quality to Dr. Zhivago
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,9,"I thought this movie had already been showing in the theaters for several months because it already had over 148,000 votes. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that it had been showing less than 3 weeks! I almost decided not to go see The Promise because it only had an average rating of 5.9 out of 10. But I looked at the breakdown (by age and gender) of that rating and noticed that there were around 65,000 votes of 1/10 and that those votes where mostly by males. This strange voting pattern had caused the average voting to vary an extreme amount WRT gender, with females having a weighted average vote of over 9 but males (of all ages) giving a vote of only around 5 or 6. This strange voting pattern intrigued me so much and that I went to see the movie, which I thought was mainly a love triangle set in Turkey during World War I. Was I in for a surprise!I don't want to give anything away so I will simply state that I give this movie 9 out of 10 because the love story is interesting; the cinematography is magnificent; the characters are well developed; and, as a period piece, the locations, costumes and sets are incredibly well done.After seeing this excellent movie I understood why there were so many super low votes of 1. These low votes are being made either by an anti-campaign voting bot or by multiple Turkish males (probably sponsored by the Turkish government) which will not want anyone to see this amazing movie, which is inspired by historic events. The epic scope and cinematography reminds me most of the movie Dr. Zhivago (1965, with Omar Sharif & Julie Christie -- that movie has an IMDb rating of 8 out 10 with only 48,000 votes and it's been around for over 50 years!)Go see this movie and decide for yourself! It will become a classic within its genre."
" Moving Tragedy
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,10,"I saw the movie twice and regret the low attendance in the theater. Till then, I was aware of the tragedy that befell the poor Armenians but had no idea of the magnitude of the cruelty perpetrated by the Turks. That is on par with the tragedy visited upon the Jews by the madman, Hitler.The difference between the Armenians and the Jews is it has been widely revealed and wish the Armenians could also follow their methods. I wanted to buy a copy of the movie to show people in India when I travel there next month and contacted the organization in Washington, D.C. but they were unavailable to do so. The disemboweling of pregnant women and confiscating their valuables etc. reminds me of similarities between the horrors inflicted upon the Hindus by the Muslims during partition and the creation of a Hindu and Muslim state respectively. May God bless the souls of the poor Armenians.I would like to buy the copy of the movie and if someone could direct me a source, would appreciate it.Bill"
" Beautiful and touching story nestled in a dark chapter of history.
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,10,"This was a very touching and beautiful movie, with wonderful performances by an impressive cast of actors. Oscar Isaac delivered an Oscar worthy performance. His acting in Ex Machina and now in The Promise prove that he is an amazing actor who can live and breathe whatever character he assumes. Some of the scenes in the movie were absolutely breathtaking. The period costumes deserve an honorable mention."
" Excellent and important historical movie
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,10,The Promise's painful portrait of the Armenian genocide isn't an easy one to watch. But the story it tells is worth hearing. The movie is very well written with an excellent and accurate historical story. This is a movie that everyone needs to see. It's a shame that the online ratings are being bombarded by Turkish efforts to bring the movie down.
" Wonderful Historical Film
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,9,This is a powerful film of a story that needs to be told and retold so the promise of good people can live on in future generations. A wonderfully acted film. Thank you for bringing history to film in a compelling manner. This is a must see film about a terrible period in human history. May we acknowledge and move on thanks in part to film-making as this.
" Great historical film
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,10,This is an epic historical movie marking the first genocide of the 20th century. Watch this film! Tragic but important story. The love story added to this real life historical drama will keep u interested especially if u don't particularly like historical movies. It's sad Turkish people used trips online to lower the ratings of this film.
" Excellent Film A Must See
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,10,"This is an amazing film, it depicts without gore and blood the real atrocities that the Armenians incurred in 1915. The film was so well done for so many reasons. The real story line was very subtle while focusing on a love story that was beautiful and sad at the same time. The actors were excellent, very believable and the film kept the audiences interest the whole two hours. I give the film 5 stars and encourage people to go see the film to learn a little history that took place in 1915."
" Nobody Can Deny This Film's Relevance!!!
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,7,"The savage Armenian genocide depicted in director Terry George's sprawling, historical epic ""The Promise"" overshadows not only its stellar cast, including Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac, and Charlotte Le Bon, but also the hackneyed triangular romance among these characters during the decline of the once formidable Ottoman Empire in Turkey. Set in 1915, as the First World War devastated the globe, this largely humorless, 134-minute, PG-13 rated, extravaganza attempts to do for the little-known Armenian Genocide what ""Dr. Zhivago"" (1965) and ""Reds"" (1981) did for the Russian Revolution. While George and co-scenarist Robin Swicord of ""The Jane Austen Book Club"" deserve kudos for their serious subject matter, the film doesn't generate enough charisma for us to care about happens to its woebegone lovers entangled in this calamity. Reportedly, the Muslim Turks slaughtered about 1.5 million Armenian Christians between 1915 and 1918 in an atrocity surpassed only by Nazi Germany's systematic extermination of Jews in their death camps in World War II. Indeed, the history in ""The Promise"" exerts more impact dramatically than the formulaic characters forged to engross us with their travails. The problem most mainstream moviegoers may encounter with ""The Promise"" is a total lack of knowledge about this infamous campaign of ethnic cleansing.Apart from little known foreign films about this genocidal annihilation, such as Germany's ""The Cut"" (2014), Italy's ""The Lark Farm"" (2007), Canada's ""Ararat"" (2002),"" and France's ""Mother ""(1991), George and Swicord plunge audiences into this wholesale wiping out of men, women, and children without making the depiction sickening. Simultaneously, the filmmakers indict Turkey, the successor state of the Ottoman Empire, for ghastly crimes against humanity that the country has denied ever happened. Indeed, the initial release of the film in 2016 was timed to coincide with the 100-year anniversary of this cataclysm. While Bale, Isaac, and Le Bon struggle valiantly to rise above the blood, sweat, and tears as three-dimensional characters, ""The Promise"" succeeds more as a history lesson than a heartbreaking soap opera. The late Hollywood billionaire producer Kirk Kerkorian, an Armenian-American who once owned the prestigious MGM Studios, poured more than $90 million into the production of this forthright film. Inevitably, ""The Promise"" may fare better with overseas audiences than with domestic American audiences that gorge on box office fantasies about indestructible superheroes and classical fairy tales like ""Beauty and the Beast"" because this hotly debated controversy has been covered up since it occurred. Turkey still claims defiantly that the Armenian genocide never happened despite overwhelming documentation.A humble Armenian apothecary, Mikael Boghosian (Oscar Isaac of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""), aspires to be a physician so he can help his people. Unfortunately, he lacks the financial wherewithal to attend the prominent Imperial Medical School in Constantinople. Ultimately, Mikael embarks on his dream with the dowry--four hundred gold coins for tuition--that he obtains after he becomes engaged to Maral (Angela Sarafyan of ""Mercury Plains""), a naively innocent but homely girl from his Southern Turkey village. Although he barely knows Maral, Mikael owns up to his vow to marry a woman that he doesn't really love when he completes his education. Once Mikael arrives in Constantinople (now contemporary Istanbul), an affluent uncle, Mesrob (Igal Naor of ""300: Rise of an Empire""), allows him to live in comfort with his family. Our protagonist comes across a sophisticated Armenian beauty, Ana Khesarian (Charlotte Le Bon of ""The Hundred-Foot Journey""), who grew up in Paris, France. She serves as a dance tutor for Mesrob's daughters. Mikael becomes hopelessly infatuated with Ana. Were this not bad enough, considering his promise to Maral, Mikael learns Ana is involved with a veteran Associated Press correspondent, Chris Myers (Christian Bale of ""Batman Begins""), who is covering Turkey's entry into World War I on the Kaiser's side. Interestingly, these two men become stalwart friends, even though each are rivals for the affections of the beautiful Ana.This fragile romantic bubble bursts when World War I erupts, and each of the three confront personal hardship. Suddenly, the Turks start shooting unarmed Armenians with little provocation, based on rumors Armenians are joining the Russian Army against the Ottoman Empire. A firebrand photo-journalist who thrives on covering headline stories, Myers witnesses Turks shooting Armenians in cold blood. Eventually, the Turks arrest Myers for his dispatches. They accuse him of espionage and threaten to execute him if he doesn't retract his stories. The headstrong Myers calls their bluff, and American ambassador Henry Morgenthau (James Crowell of ""L.A. Confidential"") appears at the Turkish Embassy to demand Myers' release. Meantime, Mikael has been left destitute from Turkish depredations and becomes a refugee. Sadly, while other Armenians wield firearms to repulse the Turks, Mikael falls back on his medical training to save lives. He stares in horror as defenseless women and children, particularly his Maral, are forced to flee from their destroyed homes, trudging through an inhospitable wilderness, menaced by armed Turks every step of the way. Later, he watches Maral die during their flight into the wilderness.Once the Turks reluctantly release Myers from captivity, the journalist boards a French battleship on the pretext of reporting the news so Americans will understand what is happening. The French battleship steams to a rendezvous where they will pick up Armenians refugees, including Mikael and Ana, making their way to the coast. A battle breaks out between the Turks and the French as the refugee's board lifeboats for the safety of the French battleship. Tragedy strikes during a mortar barrage on the lifeboats, while Mikael, Ana, and Myers are heading toward the ship. Discretion prevents me from divulging who dies, but the manner of death resembles Leonardo DiCaprio's fate in the movie ""Titanic."" The performances are all first-rate, with Christian Bale taking top honors as the intrepid reporter. Altogether, ""The Promise"" qualifies as an uneven, but above-average period piece about a timely subject—the Armenian genocide—that is sadly undercut by a mediocre romance."
" Amazing movie
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie was hands down the greatest movie I have seen. The acting was great and so was the plot. Amazing! I enjoyed the fact that it incorporated love and history at the same time. It really brought the movie to life. The historical references were very accurate and really tell the truth as to what happen during the Armenian Genocide. I must warn you however, it is a very hard movie to watch. You will catch yourself tearing up and/or crying throughout the movie. Great film. I 100% recommend it."
" Powerful telling of the Armenian genocide
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,8,Very powerful movie depicting the plight of the Armenian people. 102 years have passed since the Armenian genocide and to this day many people still do not know that the Turk's killed 1.5 Million Armenians. I hope this film helps educate people about the Armenian genocide. Thank you to Kirk Kerkorian for funding the making of this film.
" Very important film
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,10,"I would probably give the movie a rating of 8 or 9 Stars, but instead you have fight against the Turkish-Troll comunity giving the movie just one Star without watching it. This is truly not a movie made for historians. Its a movie for the common people outside there, never listen about the Genocide in their entire live."
" The story that has been denied (and still is) - needed telling
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,8,"This is a film of a true and important historical drama set during WW1, about the Armenian Genocide of 1915. With a great cast, staring Christian Bale, who plays an American journalist, reporting the truth. Oscar Isaac, who plays an Armenian, medical student, who goes to Constantinople to study, and Charlotte Le Bon, who consequently plays the love interest in the love triangle aspect. So, this is the clear depiction of the cruelty and in-humaneness that occurred and events that the Turks do not acknowledge and are still denying to this day. An extraordinary film, highly recommended."
" Finally, a film about the WWI genocide
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,9,"Many films have been made about or that show the Nazi genocide of World War II – the Holocaust. Now, 100 years after it happened, the genocide of World War I comes to the screen. Kudos to those who worked to bring this film about.""The Promise"" is about the Ottoman genocide of one Christian group within its own empire. From 1915 to after the end of the war, Muslim Turks killed 1.5 million Armenian Christians. Most were unarmed peasants, including women, children and babies. It's unfortunate that 21st century movie makers think they must have a romance or love story to be able to sell drama films. Especially, it seems, in the case of historical films. If it is indeed an important part of the history, then it belongs. But, most often, it doesn't. ""The Promise"" is a tremendous historical film, with a love triangle that detracts from the main story. This film would be much better without it. This is such a compelling story of a terrible event in history, that it is best when it stands on its own. Otherwise, the main story, screenplay, direction, and production all are superb. And, all of the cast do excellent work in their roles. Oscar Isaac gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Mikael Boghosian. The film is a good look at a time and place in history, and how bitterness of one culture toward another can lead to barbarism. The Young Turks were a group of Muslims that came to power in the fading years of the Ottoman Empire. Their disdain for the Christian Armenians led to the first genocide of the 20th century. Attorney and author Raphael Lemkin coined the term, genocide, in 1944 in his book, ""Axis Rule in Occupied Europe."" The United Nation ratified the Genocide Convention on Dec. 9, 1948. Most nations supported it, but some did so with reservations. After that, individual nations passed laws to enforce the convention. The U.S. didn't pass such a law until 1988, when it became the 98th nation to do so. As of 2017, 147 nations have ratified or acceded to the genocide convention. Interestingly, though, the U.S., Great Britain and Israel have been reluctant to call the slaughter of 1.5 million Armenians a genocide. They haven't wanted to offend Turkey as an ally. The Turkish government has always denied that there was a genocide. It has acknowledged that there were killings, but says that these were traitors or suspected conspirators with Turkey's enemies. I find it difficult to imagine such a threat posed by all those women, children, and babies that had to be annihilated. This movie shows one group of about 4,000 Armenians who resisted and fled, acquiring some arms along the way. But, the vast majority were unarmed and marched off to their deaths. At the same time, the Ottoman Turks also were slaughtering other Christian groups within their own empire. From 150,000 to 300,000 Christians in the far eastern part of the empire were killed in the Assyrian genocide. Besides the Muslim Ottoman army, the Kurds and other Muslim groups took part in that slaughter. The Greek genocide at the same time killed 450,000 to 750,000 Christians from the central area of Turkey. This is a story that needed to be told and shown in film. One might yet wonder what good has come from the Genocide convention. In 1994, most of the world sat by and watched on TV as the ruling power (Hutu) in Rwanda slaughtered 800,000 people of a minority group (Tutsi). United Nations forces stood by and watched as barbarians used machetes to chop people to death. ""Hotel Rwanda"" is an excellent film made 10 years after the 1994 Rwandan genocide. One scene stands out. While we see the carnage on the streets, we hear a radio broadcast in the background. U.S President Bill Clinton is condemning the senseless killing taking place. Yet, no nation lifted a finger to stop it during those 15 weeks from April 7 to July 19.I have seen many documentary films about the Holocaust and later genocides. I pray that we may yet one day have humane leaders who will stop the senseless killing of innocent people."
" Well Done
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,10,"This film deserves to be seen by any human being. there's been a massive disinformation campaign against the film, but the story it tells is true and moving. That fact that a nation and its blindly indifferent people to historical truth lie about a fact does not diminsh the power of the film Shame on Turkey and its Armenian genocide deniers!"
" Beautiful & tragic
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,10,"As a 1st generation Armenian, I saw my family on the screen and cried! Incredible cinematography that hopefully will be recognized. Real to life portrayal of the warmth, compassion and love Armenians show towards others. The movie was 100% realistic all the way to the end. Fantastic actors and I hope to see them win international awards. Bravo!"
" Denial is a river in Egypt
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,10,"I became familiar with the Armenian genocide when I read of a quote attributed to Hitler: ""I have placed my death-head formations in readiness - for the present only in the East - with orders to them to send to death mercilessly and without compassion , men, women, and children of Polish derivation and language. Only thus shall we gain the living space (lebensraum) which we need. Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians""? I then heard a song by Charles Aznavour: ""They Fell"". The song spoke for them and so does this epic.The best since ""Doctor Zhivago"". I gave this a ten partly because of the political campaign against it, but would have given it at least an eight anyway.Beautifully acted and filmed.The Turkish government has backed another film of alternative history entitled "" ""The Ottoman Lieutenant."""
" Excellent Movie
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,10,"Very well written, sad, and full of emotion. The ending was beautiful with a message for hope and a new life. We see this sad history repeat over and over under brutal governments and yet to this day, the Turkish government remains in denial of their past. All one has to do is look at the thousands of newspaper reports and photographs on the New York Times alone during that time, not to mention reports from the US ambassador to Turkey, Henry Morgenthau. Over a million and a half Armenian lost their lives during this period, along with their possessions, and property. Millions were displaced to other countries as refugees and had to start all over again."
" Lengthy Clichéd Historical Romance
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,7,"A romantic triangle played out against the background of war and upheaval. No, not ""Dr. Zhivago,"" not ""Gone with the Wind,"" not ""Casablanca,"" although such lofty aspirations are there in director Terry George's ""The Promise."" Mikhael Boghosian, a young Armenian, leaves his family and his betrothed to pursue medical studies in Constantinople. There, he meets the lovely Ana Khesarian, who is involved with American journalist Chris Myers. The ensuing entanglements, improbable hair-breath escapes, and impossible coincidences occur while Turkey is enmeshed in the first world war and enforcing the ""resettlement"" of its Armenian population. The Armenian genocide and Turkey's denial are well known, and ""The Promise"" has a strong political agenda. However, agendas are not entertainment, and the film succeeds or fails on the credibility of its characters and situations. Despite the film's major assets, the central romance is clichéd; well-bred young woman torn between an idealistic crusader and a passionate healer. Throw in Armenian orphans singing ""Alouette,"" pistols that click but don't fire at critical moments, and a watery scene torn from ""Titanic,"" then mix with lingering overwrought reunions, tender words and kisses while hell-fire rains, and movie buffs will chuckle as they recall each film being plagiarized.However, large-scale crowd scenes, skirmishes between Turkish troops and Armenian refugees, and arduous treks through rugged mountains take place against striking locations in Malta and Portugal and are backed by Gabriel Yared's fine score. The huge production budget is evident on screen, and the cast is strong as well. Oscar Isaac as Mikhael is especially good as the Dr. Zhivago character; torn between a promise to his mother and fiancée and a passion for Ana, Isaac holds the film together as dedicated healer, passionate lover, and Armenian patriot. Charlotte Le Bon as Ana, however, is perhaps too prim and ladylike to survive the rigorous treks her character faces; while she is fine in the early drawing room scenes in Constantinople, her romance with Mikhael seems to blossom overnight and her ordeal as a fugitive would have quickly killed a woman of her fragile nature. The third member of the triangle, Christian Bale, gives a solid performance as Myers, although the part demands little of his talent.Whatever the film's flaws and excessive length, ""The Promise"" does throw light on an historical event that has been suppressed and denied. The movie can be termed a missed opportunity; a ""must see"" film would have drawn audiences to the romance and educated them to the history. As the film stands, only those already familiar with the history will likely be interested; the romance is an overly familiar yawn."
" A Piece of History Americans Must Learn
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,7,"I was curious which version of the Armenian Genocide this movie would tell. A fiction, that 1.5 million Armenians, 500,000 Greeks, and 250,000 Assyrian Christians were victims of a ""civil war?"" Or would its makers place responsibility where it belongs -- on the leaders of the Ottoman Empire in WW-I?To this day, the Turkish government refuses to admit the crime and its supporters took great lengths to derail this movie by flooding internet cinema sites with poor 1.5 ratings to discourage Americans from seeing the film. This, despite the courageous efforts of Turkish dissidents and opposition political leaders who have dared to speak up on the ugliest episode in their country's history.The story portrayed against the backdrop of this crucial period of history is a simple one. A gifted medical student, Michael played by Oscar Isaacs (Inside Llewyn Davis/Ex-Machina/A Most Violent Year) whose acting matches the intensity of the times -- receives his betrothed's dowry to complete his medical education in Constantinople. Michael arrives just as the genocide begins and falls in love with the beautiful Anna, an Armenian music protégé --performed by French-Canadian Charlotte Le Bon (The Hundred Foot Journey/The Walk) who lives with her lover Chris Meyers, an AP reporter determined to expose the genocide (played by Christian Bale (Empire of the Sun/American Hustle/American Psycho). Director Terry George, a native of Belfast, Northern Ireland (Hotel Rwanda/In the Name of the Father/Hart's War) skillfully factors in crises of the heart without trivializing the gravity of the horrific massacre in Anatolia. I digress here to confess a lesson learned. Coming from a Hellenic heritage scared by 400 years of Ottoman occupation, I expected a larger Greek presence in this movie. My ethnocentric desire to see a Greek army coming to the Armenians' rescue, made me miss entirely the message conveyed in this work. I selfishly asked ""...why were my people left out of this flick?"" Fortunately, as the end of the movie approached, two thoughts came.First, the Armenians deserve to have THEIR story told uncluttered by others. Besides, at least we Greeks HAD a country to escape to.Second, I realized that my people were in the movie and yours were, too. The Cambodians under Pol Pot, Native Americans, the Armenians and the victims of Naziism in Europe: Gypsies, Homosexuals, the horribly so-called ""Mental Deficients"" the peasants/workers of Russia, and of course, the Jews, are all our people! Perhaps someday when we realize that our Humanity is all we have to share with one another, such movies will no longer be necessary."
" A very moving story
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,9,"My father-in law was orphaned at age 3 during the Armenian Genocide and so I know the story well. All of his family, except for his eldest 21 year old brother, were lost and the circumstances were just as portrayed in the movie. My husband's grandfather and one 15 year old uncle, Hakob, were ""called up"" and murdered. His 15 year old aunt, Naomi, was kidnapped by a Turkish soldier as the family was marched through the desert and my husband has spent his life looking for her. My husband's 4 year old uncle, Stépan, disappeared while begging in a Turkish village as they were marched through - and my husband, and our new grandson, were named after this uncle. My husband's grandmother was slaughtered when she ran after her 3 year old son who had run away from the line, and she was left to die in the desert - and my father-in-law (then 3 years old!) was found next to her corpse which he refused to leave. The love story in this film is magnetic and it is worth watching the film for this story alone. But the back story of the Armenian Genocide was not an easy one for me to watch. I felt a mixture of extreme sadness watching this very real history, mixed with an incredible relief that finally the real story of this tragic human history has been told in public, - and relief that the heroism of those who fought back and the tragedy of my husband's family has finally become part of our public discourse."
" It's said that there are two sides to every story . . .
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,8,". . . and THE PROMISE documents The Truth behind the so-called ""Armenian Genocide"" of the early 1900s (for which EVERYONE INVOLVED has died). THE PROMISE is Leader Trump's kind of flick, and it's bound to warm the heart cockles of Prez #45's buddy over in Turkey (that Erdogan guy). Put out by a couple outfits with names like ""Open Road"" and ""Survival Pictures"" (possibly affiliated with the Fox and Breitbart News Organizations), the focus of THE PROMISE is as much on present-day America and Turkey as it is upon the Ancient History it ostensibly covers. THE PROMISE's filmmakers state up front that these White Christian Armenians were MINORITIES in Turkey, belligerently exercising such uppity airs as calling Istanbul by its defunct Roman Empire First Millennium moniker (""Constantinople""), building ""cathedrals"" dwarfing the mosques of the Muslim majority, and--at least in the case of the brazen exotic dancer ""Ana""--parading in public in scanty in-your-face costumes, wantonly gyrating, and flouting an addiction to a drug so debauchery-laden (absinthe) that's it's illegal in all civilized countries to this very day.At the 24:15 mark of THE PROMISE, one of the many Turkish heroes complains that ""the Armenians are a tumor in our midst."" No kidding. Everyone knows that Armenians belong in a country called ""Armenia,"" but this Turkish Minority Group was stinking outside its litter box. THE PROMISE portrays such characters as the Armenian professional clown and most of the kids as exercising such deplorable personal hygiene habits that they are riddled with body lice. (One extended scene implies that it was part of the clown's job of ""entertaining"" the Armenian kids to infest them with their own life-long set of lice.) The clown turns out to be a terrorist saboteur, blowing up his railroad work detail with a box of dynamite. This action takes place seven or eight hundred YEARS after the Christians LOST the Crusades, and Crusades have consequences. Turkey had tolerated this troublesome tumor in their midst for almost 50 generations, well beyond the time limit on such things set by Jesus in the New Testament.How do the precepts of THE PROMISE apply to Leader Trump's America? First of all, he's just installed another Originalist in the mold of Justice Scalia on our U.S. Supreme Court. Neil Gorsuch is bound to rule that ONLY Americans represented by Signers of our Independence Declaration (the root of our nation) should and will have a seat at America's Table in the Future. Therefore, if one of the Founding Father Signers was an Armenian, let his descendants stay (within reason)--even though they have their own country, Armenia. On the other hand, if all of these groups constantly proving to be a thorn in Leader Trump and all of America's side have no Representation among the Signers, boot them all back to their Homelands. Perhaps that will include Armenians, along with Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and the so-called ""Native Americans"" (whom ALL the scientists--when they're not stirring up ""Global Warming"" storm clouds--agree crossed into Our Country by a Land Bridge from Mongolia a few thousand years ago. How many XL Pipelines do you suppose they're laying in Mongolia these days?) President Erdogan has already shut down all the fake news in Modern Turkey. THE PROMISE, with its pointedly American fake newsman portrayed by Christian Bale being such a Loose Cannon Spy that he gets his ONLY Muslim friend executed for treason by firing squad--explicitly encourages Leader Trump to OUTLAW fake news, even if a few hundred heads at CNN, MSNBC, and The New York Times have to roll!"
" Evil must be exposed
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,9,"Wonderful, old-fashioned story-telling with a fictional love triangle providing the entertainment but never detracting from the horror of the pogroms, work camps and genocide. Again, as in hotel Rwanda, the horror and brutality is clearly depicted without the fashionable need for copious gore. The references in the film to Aleppo could not fail to cause the viewer to draw parallels with the plight of innocent Syrians. As all good historical dramas do, the film caused me to seek more information about this genocide and I was horrified to discover that some German attachees to the Ottoman army at this time later became key figures in the Nazi army and used their experience of the ethnic cleansing as a precedent for the Holocaust. The moral of this film is that evil must be exposed and I congratulate the film makers for having done so and hope that, as a PG film, it may be used as an educational tool in schools"
" Great movie
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,10,"An important and very necessary movie. I highly recommend this film. Great job done! It is uncovering the history and reminding about committed crimes against humanity and hall nations. Excellent work of actors and director of the film. Also many thanks to Kirk Kerkorian, who sponsored this film production."
" Averagely Told, Terribly Shot
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,7,"Watching The Promise can make one wonder why there aren't too many films about the Armenian Genocide. To my recollection only Atom Egoyan's Ararat (2002) and Henri Verneuil's Mayrig (1991) dealt with the subject though in rather indirect ways. The survivors of such cruelty would be served well to have their stories engraved in celluloid and, without sounding too callous, the larger geo-political climate, the filigree of the time-period and the exotic Turkish countryside only yields the ability to tell truly beautiful films.Perhaps this was the motivation behind director Terry George's return to form. To tell a story worth telling. The Promise however is not a true story, but a historical fiction that follows a love-triangle through the Ottoman's entrance into WWI to the Armenian resistance battle at Musa Dagh in 1915. Our participants, Armenian medical student Mikael (Isaac), ballet instructor Ana (Le Bon) and American reporter Chris (Bale) are all trying to do the right thing. Apparently doing the right thing involves being on the periphery of important events and mournfully shaking their head as things fall apart around them.This is not to say doing historical fiction like this isn't a winning formula; I mean it's not like Jack and Rose stopped the sinking of the Titanic. Yet the issue with The Promise is it distracts from the impact of those important events and instead doubles down on the saccharine, emotionally reserved and at times just plain silly pinings of Oscar Isaac and his ferreted eye brows.For the record Isaac, Bale and especially Le Bon are acting rather hard for this movie. If you squint and tilt your head you can almost see what they were going for, and even if you didn't it's still obvious their talents are worth a much better movie. Le Bon simply oozes sincerity while Bale coasts on his signature brood to give us his version of a hard-scrabbled, morally pugnacious journalist. A version that occasionally feels like you're watching a 1940's propaganda piece gently courting American audiences into the war effort.As for the ""time-period and the exotic Turkish countryside,"" director Terry George and cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe appear to be in the midst of a social experiment. That experiment being how ugly can they make the Portuguese countryside (doubling for Turkey) look without the audience noticing. The interiors are even worse with everything layered in misshapen shadows and back lit like a cheaply made Fanta commercial.I suspect somewhere in the hours of footage filmed there's a much better movie than the one we got. The story, as false footed as it is, has the potential to be satisfying while the acting can be chalked up as a modest triumph. What will no doubt win over most audiences however is their own innate humanism in the face of adversity and horror. People will no doubt project their own narratives of historical events onto the plain muslin of the screen, maybe going so far as to draw contemporary parallels. Such instincts should be encouraged and rewarded by films worthy of contemplation. The Promise's heart is definitely in the right place but a worthy film it is not."
" Love amid Genocide
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,4,"A love triangle set against the backdrop of the Armenian genocide in Turkey should deliver an intense experience, but 'The Promise' can't let go of its agenda as a propaganda exercise, which dilutes the dramatic effect. The lovers are Mickael, Chris and Ana - an Armenian medical student, an American journalist and a Franco-Armenian dance teacher, and the trio soon develop a tangled relationship. Their paths cross in Istanbul as Turkey enters the 1st World War, and the two males with crucial professions start competing for the favors of the party-loving Parisian.The story skims over both political and amorous aspects as the action zigzags across Turkey. The screenplay consistently portrays the Armenians as noble and courageous, while the Turks are mostly depicted as bullies and murderers. It addresses the issues behind the genocide only superficially when a Turkish official dismisses the Armenian community as a cancer within the nation. The romantic intrigues are given similarly shallow treatment, as Ana flits from one man to the other and back again, shedding a few tears on the way. The Armenian holocaust and the suffering of its victims deserve something far better than this lightweight melodrama."
" Amazing Movie -- Well Made
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,10,Amazing movie that is well made with History and love story messed together making it a learning and heartwarming experience. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it shows the sad part of our history where Armenians were killed by the ottoman empire. This was the most recent genocide in our history and it has been well hidden from the public.It was never produced because of the close ties with United states and Turkey.Finally God bless Kirk to basically donate his fortune for this truth to come out into lightness.Great Movie
" Best movie of 2017
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie shattered my heart into a million pieces. It captivated me from the very first moment that it began. Anyone who is critiquing this movie to death should really be ashamed of themselves. The heart of the movie is what matters, and this movie is all Heart. The film was a beautiful epic romance set during one of the darkest times in history. The 2 main characters bonded through despondency and helped each other get through the horrific genocide perpetrated by the Muslim Young Turks. I cried in the car driving home from the theater because of the impact this movie made on my heart, my soul and my mind. The Promise displayed Kirk Kerkorian's undying love for the Armenian people and the Armenian culture. God bless the man for funding this film and giving the Armenians a film that they could be proud of for the first time ever. Go See the Promise!"
" Tremendous heartfelt passionate drama
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,10,"Gripping heartfelt drama showing an episode of history long forgotten: the infinitely cruel attempted genocide of over 1 & a half million Armenians by the Turks during WWI. Great depiction of this period in history, evocative, as well as a passionate love story between three honorable characters (2 Armenians and an American journalist). Isaac, Le Bon & Bale in particular give outstanding performances in this epic. Also a great soundtrack featuring the ever-soulful, mournful Armenian duduk! We don't blame Turks living today for this, why do they still have to deny it ever happened? It can no longer be disputed."
" Poignant Glimpse of History
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,10,"The Promise deserves to be a block-buster film; poignant story line set in an historical context; beautiful cinematography. The movie does an excellent job of developing the struggles of families and friends to stick together and survive. Sadly, so few people have even heard of the Armenian Genocide. High time for the Turks to own up to this atrocity. I saw this movie at the Culver City Arclight theater on April 29, 2017."
" Excellent Movie.
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,10,"The past can not be denied. A love story in the middle of the First Genocide of the 20th Century, the Armenian Genocide. The performance of Oscar Isaac is memorable. Christian Bale, impeccable as we are accustomed. Costume of the time and music that gets into your guts. Please,see it!"
" History of The Armenian Genocide and The Promise
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,10,Excellent film depicting a love story with the background of the Armenian Genocide. Very factual and correctly portrayed. I would highly recommend it. The Armenian nation lost 1.5 million people at the the hands of the Ottoman Turks. Every surviving person had a story to tell. Those stories are carried through the generations.This Genocide happened 102 years ago. It's time the world got to know the truth !To date Turkey denies that this Genocide ever occurred.I will keep 'The Promise'
" excellent movie
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,10,"highly recommended! its a tragic story but sadly reality! It shows our (Armenians) tragic genocide by Turkish barbars. ""I should like to see any power of the world destroy this race, this small tribe of unimportant people, whose wars have all been fought and lost, whose structures have crumbled, literature is unread, music is unheard, and prayers are no more answered. Go ahead, destroy Armenia . See if you can do it. Send them into the desert without bread or water. Burn their homes and churches. Then see if they will not laugh, sing and pray again. For when two of them meet anywhere in the world, see if they will not create a New Armenia."" William Saroyan."
" A very moving & emotional story based on factual historic events
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"A very moving love story, entwined with some authentic and very tragic and emotional historic events. This movie takes place in other parts of the world, in other times, but provides a very necessary historical lesson, that should not be overlooked. As to authenticity, I have several immediate family members that were driven from their homes, businesses and property, and were either killed or seriously injured during the Genocide."
" Tragic Truth of my Culture's History
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"The Promise is an eye opening film based on the tragic massacre of the Armenian people. The film's plot line, actors, and scenery were spot on and did the Armenian people proud with their portrayal of our culture. The Promise featured the somber and sorrowful reality lived by Armenians in 1915. The film is greatly made and definitely worth a watch or two. I plan to buy it on DVD in the future. Would highly recommend, especially to anyone who is not familiar with the Armenian genocide as it is quite eye opening and informative."
" Excellent Movie, Don't Miss It
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"The Promise is an excellent movie. The acting is superb, the direction and filming are all very well done. The plot keeps your interest and incorporates many facets of exceptional story telling. You won't be disappointed. The Promise tells the tale of tragedy striking Armenians during the First World War."
" A must see Movie for Everyone
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"I saw the Armenian Genocide movie, the Promise today. This movie accomplished the task of showing the truth behind the Armenian Genocide to the uninformed. It was well written and well acted. I was teary eyed during most of the movie. For those people unfamiliar with the subject of the Armenian Genocide, the movie provided enough background information for them to do further research to enhance their knowledge. One piece of information I want to share is that the Captain of the French Warship who rescued the 4,000 Armenians from being slaughtered by the Turks and the Kurds was removed from his post or position when he returned to France because he had acted against the orders of the French government not to help or rescue the Armenians. In summary, I think it is a great movie and should be nominated for the Oscars in February 2018."
" Excellent Filmmaking
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,I've seen this film twice and both times found it riveting. Very smart story telling to expose the truth about the Armenian genocide and all done with a PG-13 rating. Tastefully done as far as war time / genocide movies can be. If you enjoy adventure films with sweeping landscape cinematography laced with a couple celebrity cameos then I believe you will enjoy this film.
" One of the best movies I have ever seen, move over Dr. Zhivago!
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"My husband and I went to see this movie last Friday. Bring tissues, what a well done movie, telling a love story and a horror story in one fell swoop. Well acted, well filmed, details are amazing. I highly recommend it to you, you won't be disappointed. The story of what happened to the Armenians and how this couple dealt with war and love will have you on the edge of your seat as well as sobbing at the end."
" Great Movie - Proceeds go to charity
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"When the movie ended, no one left. The movie offers romance and drama, all the while educating viewers of an important point in history that is unbelievably denied until this day. If you're someone who cries during movies, you'll most likely shed a few tears, especially know that you're watching true history. I do appreciate how the movie did not get graphic so you can watch a good story without having to close yours eyes the whole time."
" Bring your tissues
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,9,"Disclaimer- I am of Armenian descent. My grandparents left Armenia before the genocide. I wanted to love this movie and I did. The acting was superb, the scenery true to life, the costumes...everything evoked the sense of fear and helplessness these people went through. If I have one complaint- they should have used more Armenian actors. I totally understand that a little movie like this had to have at least one A list actor so people would see the movie, but certainly, there are Armenian actors who could have played the other two roles. See this movie. Never forget-never again. They tried to bury us...they didn't know we were seeds."
" wonderful movie for a seemingly forgotten issue...
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent, and then some. Everyone should see this film if nothing else for its historical references. It's no less sappy a love story than any other. It handled the subject of the 1915 Armenian Massacres very palpable for the general public. It's an Armenian Schindler's List with the Armenian Holocaust for a background that became an important part of the film, regardless how others choose to portray the issue with shades of the movie Midnight Express. The movie was very well done and the acting very convincing. It should be shown in the schools like Schindler's List. There are many deceitful people who simply do not like Armenians, if we were Jews could say they are anti-Semitic. As a love story it is somewhat mediocre, sappy and mediocre as any, although a bit novel with the Armenian man's integrity to keep his promise to his betrothed and both families."
" Christian Bale, Always on point. Oscar Worthy performance and film!
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"Powerful film, powerful story line, star studded cast. Christian Bale ALWAYS on target with outstanding acting. Oscar worthy all around. Thank you so much for Hotel Rwanda and The Promise. Your contribution to film is immeasurable."
" The world kept their eyes closed
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie made me proud of being Armenian.I can't thank Oscar Isaac enough for a brilliant performance. It is truly ""Oscar"" worthy. Please see this movie. I loved this movie and will see it many times in the future. Christian Bale was at his best. The actors made you feel their emotions. Proud people."
" Really good film
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"This again heats the argument between Armenian and Turkish communities. I am Armenian, and I might be judging a little subjectively, but this is a great movie. It properly reflects some of the features of those times which partially still exist in our times: like how violent a human being (if they could be called so) could be, or how brave it can be (the son of the Turkish official who studied with Mikayel), how even a survival can become a suffering, how love does not account for anything and can exist in any environment within any circumstances, and how people in love are devoted to each other that can sacrifice themselves. I think the movie conveys both the love story and the Armenian Genocide events very well; some pieces like the church liturgy scene, or the family relationships might be not as clear and impressive for a non-Armenian viewer, but even without those the film does not lack any of the objective values a good film implies. Strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie, and also not to leave negative feedback without watching it only because you are of Turkish origin (that is what happened to this movie from the day it was released, and that is why the rating is still not excellent).For those who still question whether there was a genocide or not, please watch the documentary ""AGHET 1915"" on YouTube, it's available in 4 languages (Աղետ (Aghet) in Armenian means catastrophe)."
" A hard reminder of the barbarism of the Ottoman Empire, the Turkish people to exterminate the Armenians
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,9,"This movie hurt my soul. As the mother of an Armenian daughter I learned first hand the stories of my grandmother in law being rounded up and driven from her home. The death walks were just as depicted in this movie, and she never closed her eyes at night without the memories. She was orphaned, just as the children in the movie. Christian Bale has done, maybe, his greatest performance ever! He was humble when it came to his lover, Ana. He knew he was losing her to her Armenian soulmate, but he was a hero to her and to the Armenian people, selflessly. I loved him in this confident, tough role. So, if you haven't already done so, see this move and cry for the Armenians."
" Excellent film on a difficult subject.
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"Not an easy subject to cover,but essential for mankind to know about this,I find most people have never heard of this atrocity,mostly ""hidden"" by other events of WW1.For those who enjoyed this movie,the definitive account is a book by Taner Akam called A Shamefull Act.Like the Barbary coast pirates 100years before this and what goes on now,Monotheism has provided an excuse for hideous acts such as portrayed in this movie,furthermore many historians believe this is where the Nazis got the idea for their genocide a few years later.Fast forward 100 years and guess what? The killing of dozens of Coptic Christians,so this film is relevant today,and didn't deserve the infantile,incompetent,review in the Observer."
" The Promise Film Review
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,"The new drama film The Promise based on a true story starring Óscar Isaac, Christian Bale, Charlotte Le Bon.In The Promise it is 1914 two years after the Titanic sank and the Suffragette Movement in 1912. As the Great War looms, the mighty Ottoman Empire is crumbling. Constantinople, the once vibrant, multicultural capital on the shores of the Bosporus, is about to be consumed by chaos. Michael Boghosian (Guatemala actor Óscar Isaac - Ex Machina, Star Wars: The Force Awakens), arrives in the cosmopolitan hub as a medical student determined to bring modern medicine back to Siroun, his ancestral village in Southern Turkey where Turkish Muslims and Armenian Christians have lived side by side for centuries. Photo-journalist Christopher Myers (Welsh actor Christian Bale - The Dark Knight films, Terminator Salvation), has come here only partly to cover geo-politics. He is mesmerized by his love for Ana Khesarian (Canadian actress Charlotte le Bon - The Walk, The Hundred-Foot Journey), an Armenian artist he has accompanied from Paris the capital of France after the sudden death of her father. When Michael meets Ana, their shared Armenian heritage sparks an attraction that explodes into a romantic rivalry between the two men. As the Turks form an alliance with Germany and the Empire turns violently against its own ethnic minorities, their conflicting passions must be deferred while they join forces to survive even as events threaten to overwhelm them. Promises are made and promises are broken. The one promise that must be kept is to live on and tell the story.Amongst the other actors / actresses in The Promise include Spanish actor Daniel Giménez-Cacho (Bad Education, El Narco) as Reverend Dikran Antreassian, Iranian actress Shohreh Aghdashloo (X-Men: The Last Stand, Star Trek Beyond) as Marta Boghosian, Dutch actor Marwan Kenzari (Ben-Hur 2016, Collide) as Emre Ogan, Armenian American actress Angela Sarafyan (US TV Series Westworld, The Twlight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2) as Maral, English actor Tom Hollander (Pirates Of The Caribbean films, Valkyrie) as Garin, Turkish actor Numan Acar (The Great Wall, US TV Series Homeland) as Mustafa, Israeli actor Igal Naor (300: Rise Of An Empire, Green Zone) as Mesrob, Milene Mayer as Yeva, English actor Tamer Hassan (Kick-Ass, Layer Cake) as Faruk Pasha, Spanish actress Alicia Borrachero (The Chronicles Of Narnia: Prince Caspian, Spanish TV Series Hospital Central) as Lena, Spanish actor Abel Folk (Savage Grace, The Deal) as Harut, Moroccan actor Jean Reno (Léon, Ronin) as Admiral Fournet, American actor James Cromwell (Spider-Man 3, The Queen) as Ambassador Morgenthau, British actor Kevork Malikyan (Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade, Taken 2) as Vartan Boghosian, Lucía Zorrilla as Tamar, Armenian actor Roman Mitichayn (Message From The King, Enter The Fist And The Golden Fleece) as Van, Iranian actor Armin Amiri (The Wrestler, Factory Girl) as Captain Ali, Stewart Scudamore (Kick-Ass 2, Risen) as Ismet Ogan, American actor Andrew Tarbet (Exodus: Gods And Kings, Walking Tall) as Pastor Merril, late Israeli actor Aharon Ipalé (The Mummy films, Son Of The Pink Panther) as Dr. Nazim, Aaron Neil (Honour, UK TV Series Peaky Blinders) as Talaat Pasha, James Chanos as General Zyniker and American actor Michael Stahl-David (Cloverfield, The Congress) as Brad.Filming locations in The Promise include countries like Turkey, Malta, Portugal, Spain, USA.Overall The Promise is a good drama film filled with drama, war, love, peace, passion, disturbing upsetting scenes, gory violence, torture, people being treated like pieces of rubbish and animals, fights and battles between Turkish people and Armenian people, dancing, opera dancing music, guns, shooting, people getting hurt and injured, betrayal, loyalty, friendship, family, togetherness, team work, Armenian people being mistreated by Turkish people, falling outs, arguments, ships, eye catching scenery and many other things throughout the film.So I will give The Promise an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and The Promise is worth seeing if you like drama films like Silence, Schindler's List, Braveheart, The Bridge On The River Kwai, Gandhi, Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom, the Robin Hood films amongst others.So if you get the chance to see The Promise in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later."
" Well done, great cast, a story that has to be told
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"I don't get out to the move theater as much as used to. I had heard this story was going to illuminate the big screen with important historical relevance. The method in which the story was woven together gave an effective taste of peace to destruction. A roller coaster of twists and turns, full of emotions..and showing the cruelty of genocide & hate. The love story in a difficult struggle of survival, was engaging and unfolded in layers. I read a very interesting article on this movie which states the fact vs fiction in regards to this film. http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/the-promise/In the end this is an important film. It is shameful that Turkey denies the Armenian genocide, and the US as well. Just as the holocaust was a low point in history, I recall seeing Schindler's list and I was deeply moved seeing this film. I felt it an important movie for all to see so genocide is recognized and those guilty are punished. This is the same way I feel about the promise, it is am movie everyone should see. Genocide has happened too often, and it must be recognized, and brought to light. I think that it is wonderful that the profits of this film are going to charity for tremendous causes."
" Made me want to learn more
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,9,"Good movie, not Academy award merit, but very well done portrayal of a small window into the lives of a few people during the Armenian genocide. Not manipulative, but made me wish to look up more information about this sad story. Man's inhumanity to man continues but this movie gave it a human face that made it good movie fare."
" Why did it have to happen?
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,9,"A member of the audience asked me why did the massacre on the screen have to happen? She was upset that people could be so cruel to each other in so many different ways and occasions. As much of the audience, many didn't know about this historical event. It's sad to realize that sometimes it takes something terrible to make people react and start doing something good to heal. The saddest thing is that we tend to ignore the signs, and then it's too late. The best thing is that in the middle of some horrific events, there's still hope, and that eventually we'll heal, and we might not do it again.Loaded with good acting, and with the feel of an epic, even though it runs for barely a little over two hours, ""The Promise"" has some of the best acting of the year, with Isaac and Bale commanding the screen. Both are equally good in their portrayal of one ordinary man who loses most of his dear ones in a what some argue was a political move. Yet, the portrayal is simple and direct, with most of the reactions originating from the destruction of a plain and normal world into hell. Things become more complicated when he falls in love with a wonderful woman who easily captivates all around her, sometimes without being aware of it. The other part of the triangle is Christian Bales' kind reporter, a man who believes in telling others the truth, in trying hard to do the best he can to prevent evil from continuing, and he's even willing to part with the only woman he loves if that means she will be happy.""The Promise"" is a love story, a historical tale, a portrayal of an era that left a dark mark in humanity. It's an important movie because it will teach many about something that should not remain hidden, and it will remind many that even in darkness there's room for hope, and we should keep that alive, always and more importantly in times like ours."
" Powerful screenplay and outstanding performances
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"A gut-wrenching portrayal of a Christian minority—Armenians—in the Ottoman Empire during one of the most turbulent periods in modern history that still today haunts protractors and detractors alike. Terry George provides a lucid portrait of cultural destruction without any unnecessary gore or uncomfortable rape scenes that we have scene in other films that depicted the Armenian massacre. The film has a nice blend of action, drama and romance. It begins with mesmerizing sceneries, particularly of Constantinople, where a young and ambitious Armenian would-be doctor from small-town Siroun moved to with the dowry from his marriage so that he could provide his family with a better life. Soon after the enchanting introduction, the film progressively lunges deep into scenes of chaos and heartache. The combination of a powerful screenplay and commanding performances by the primary cast—Oscar Isaac, Charlotte Le Bon, Christian Bale—will glue you to your seat, and a 2 hour film may seem like it only lasted an hour.The Promise provides an accurate portrayal of the Armenian experience during this troubling time, at least as I've heard from within the Armenian community. When I was younger my grandfather shared some extraordinary stories of how some members of his family survived the onslaught and fled the persecution of the Ottoman empire—burying slain family members in the dark of night before escaping over rooftops to save their own lives. I was awestruck by these anecdotes. I couldn't imagine such torment. But, then I heard other Armenians share the stories passed down to them from their ancestors and they were equally bizarre. The story of Mikael Boghosian, magnificently portrayed by Oscar Isaac, was similar to the accounts of I've heard. Despite mounting recognition from many scholars, governments and massive organizations, such as the Catholic Church, that the mass killings of the Armenians in 1915 at the hands of the Ottoman Turks was a genocide, Turkey still adamantly protests that its government was ever so callous. No sitting U.S. president has declared this killing a genocide for political expediency since Turkey is a vital geo-political ally in the unstable Middle East, although then-Senator Barack Obama did recognize it as genocide. The questionable plethora (tens of thousands) of 1 star reviews of The Promise prior to the film even being released is also an indication of how intensely divisive this topic is still today. Whether you're prepared to label the killing of 1.5 million Armenians during this time a systematic destruction of an ethnic group or believe it to be a consequence of a larger war, The Promise accurately depicts the experience of Armenians in the Ottoman empire from just a few generations ago (102 years to be exact)—a dark, endless abyss of violence, torment, and destruction. At the very least, it's a gripping plot with a outstanding performances by the lead cast members. One of the most notable scenes of the film was between Anna Khesarian (Charlotte Le Bon) and Mikael Boghosian (Oscar Isaac), which portrays how Armenians have since managed to cope with this tragic period: Because all was lost and not much could have been done about it, ""our revenge will be to survive."""
" Excellent!!!
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"Outstanding work of Oscar Isaac! He is just outstanding!! I was overwhelmed with emotions and tears. I've sobbed for two hours! Great movie and some excellent actors. Would recommend to watch it, brings light to Turkish barbarity and history so many had no idea about. Would have loved to see some more critical political characters but I guess there would have been too much of Turkish pressure it there was any. Great movie, great actors!!! Finally many non Armenians can get some sort of idea of Armenians and barbarian turks."
" Beautifully produced, moving homage to the victims of the Armenian Genocide
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"Beautifully produced tribute of history to the victims of the Armenian genocide. I understand that this was a labor of love from the financier of the film, and I felt privileged to see it, and shared a sense of joy in his victory that the film was finally produced -- and done so lavishly and accurately. I love that the producer fit in the account of Musa Dagh, and I encourage anyone with an interest in this piece of history to dig deeper into that, as it really shares the spirit of the Armenian people. Can't recommend this film highly enough to folks of any age. Blessings and respect to all who suffered, and to all who helped them (including the makers of this fine film)!"
" This needs to be nominated for Best Picture and More!
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"And why aren't the critics giving The Promise its due praise? I am frankly tired of Hollywood do-over-and-over-and-overs.None of that in this movie. It is novel and original and will hold your interest. If it isn't nominated for awards, something really stinks in Hollywood.The only actor I recognized was Christian Bale... and perhaps that's what made this movie so completely excellent -- the film was not ruined by miscast pop culture personalities who's only purpose is to generate box office! The casting was just perfect and the acting was completely believable. If you love details: the costumes, interiors, and other small set accessories were spot on; and the scenery was magnificent. This has all the elements we crave in a well developed movie: good script, depth in characters, suspense and excitement, exotic locals, historical accuracy and significance; a little romance, a little gore -- it was simply perfect in every way.Like a wonderful David Lean picture, the film will sweep you up and keep you engaged. I recommend this movie as much for the production values as for the historical relevance. See it. Think about it. It will not leave you for a long time.Bravo!!!P.S. bring Kleenex"
" Beautifully shot and superbly acted!
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie really has it all: a riveting story line, gorgeous scenery, and flawless acting - plus Christian Bale! The Promise is the perfect combination of love story and war movie. It's a movie that exposes the tragedy of the first genocide of the 20th century. It's a tough subject that has mostly been swept under the rug until now. Pro tip: bring lots of tissues!"
" The Promise
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"I'll describe it with one word. Outstanding! This s a must see movie! It is an emotionally engaging and very well directed. Bravo! Excellent execution, the cast, the story... I would say it could have been a little more visual as not too many scenes were depicted that could show the real truth and the reality of how exactly things went during those times. Overall, this is an outstanding movie which should have hit a little harder than it did."
" Beautiful and factual story with unfair low reviews
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"This is a wonderful story that touches the viewer as its story is based on actual facts that occurred about a century ago. I highly recommend this movie as it is very well made, historically very factual with a very touching love story amidst the horrible and very tragic Armenian Genocide. The movie accurately portrays the unbelievable evil and heartless wickedness of the Ottoman Empire which is modern day Turkey. Being a curious mind I looked into the low ratings of this move here and it was quite easy for me to conclude that these despicable and lying reviewers are either Turks, Muslims or Turkey sympathizers. Turkey keeps denying that the tragic Armenian Genocide ever happened, but the world knows better as this truth is documented throughout the world and in fact there are 28 countries in this world that have recognized the Armenian Genocide. Read the truth and the actual facts on Wikipedia here: ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide"". Turkey cannot hide the truth any longer and it should recognize their unbelievable evil, inhumane and heartless crimes as soon as possible just like Germany did with recognizing the Holocaust. Go see this movie, you will enjoy the beautiful and touching love story and learn some history too, and learn a thing or two about the first genocide of the 20th century. Turkey should be extremely ashamed of itself."
" A must see movie!!
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,10,"Amazing movie, the truth is told in a clever and beautiful love story.! Thanks to all the actors who played an absolutely heartfelt roles. Thank you Kirk Kerkorian🙏🏻And RIP knowing the money you spent on this movie, didn't go in vein. I will go see this movie again, and encourage every human being, Armenian or non Armenia to go see this movie in theaters..."

I encourage everyone to see it. +++++++++++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++
" Powerful, Epic and Historic film!
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"Finally, a dark piece of history revealed to the masses. The Turkish government tried all it can to prevent this from happening, but the persistence of the Armenian people prevailed. The modern Turkish Government will hate any reference to a genocide that is depicted by this movie. Genocide did happen to Armenia​ns, Greeks, Assyrians and other minorities. Hitler knew that Turkey ""got away with"" this genocide, so he was emboldened to act in the way he did. The gruesome reality of the Ottomans' barbarism was toned down to make the movie more palatable to sensitive audiences with a PG rating. This is a victory for good over evil. Justice has been denied the Armenians for 102 years but this movie brings us one step closer to bringing the truth to a world obsessed with comic book escapism and cell phones distraction. There is no statute of limitations on the truth. A great movie. Everything from the story line and its backdrop, the attempted genocide of the Armenians by the Young Turks, the acting (Specially Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale were phenomenal), the cinematography, they were all great. A must see for everyone."
" Excellent Movie
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,Beautiful and heartbreaking story which shows how Armenians were treated back in 1914- 1915. Amazing movie thank you so much for making this movie and by showing the story of Armenian people. I would like to see more historical movies like this that can show our story and everyone can see and understand that we will always remember and never forget our past and we are proud to be Armenian.
" Riveting and touching
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"Not a dull moment. This is an amazing motion picture. Cast, direction and cinematography at its best. It's definitely a tear jerker but the director does a great job of leaving the gore and graphic parts of the massacre but yet still hit home with the message of what the Armenian people endured. Charlotte, Isaac and Christian are all on top of their game."
" ""For when two of them meet anywhere in the world, see if they will not create a New Armenia.""
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"I haven't been to a movie in years. I just don't think they're made well anymore and I come away with a list of mental notes on how a film could have been better. Being a history buff, I felt I needed to see this film, and I was not disappointed. I don't remember the last time I saw a film and could offer no improvements. It is perfect and has a balance of elements that I haven't seen in films since the golden age of cinema. The acting is superb, the story is tight and well written- nothing overstated and nothing lacking in conveyance - the cinematography is gorgeous, the costumes are era-appropriate and beautifully made, and there is a perfect balance of emotion, love, fear, perseverance, and even blood/guts/gore/themes of war. There is no superfluous sex or violence, just the right amount to indicate what needs to be told. The plight of the Armenian people is, though, extremely heartbreaking. I was in tears through a large portion of it, so be sure to have tissues with you when you see it. I hope it wins scads of awards! Well done, filmmakers. Thank you for making such a beautiful film about such a dark period of our world history. Everyone needs to know what Armenians went through so that, just maybe, similar actions might cease to happen in our future. We can only hope and pray. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Well done!"
" Amazing movie, had me sobbing!
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"This is a true masterpiece; I am simply not sure how anyone could give this movie a low rating. Amazing acting and plot-- all the elements are so intertwined. The last 15 minutes of the film really get to you, it's impossible to hold back tears. Genius creation, definitely recommend everyone to see The Promise and understand the struggles the Armenian people had to go through."
" Go, take a friend, tell others to go
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"Outstanding movie, too bad it couldn't have been filmed on location. Wish more people knew more about this period of time in Turkish history. What happened in Turkey resulting from them being on the wrong side of WWI set the stage for the conflict's we see today in the Middle East. The destruction and division of the Ottoman Empire by the West created fragmented groups and counties that were designed to be ineffective and puppet governments to western powers and gave rise to all sorts of problems. We can all learn about the past to better understand how we got here and to where we are going in the future."
" A great Oscar Worthy movie, with excellent cinematography
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"A call of Love, Truth and Divine Justice : A great Oscar Worthy movie, with excellent cinematography, outstanding plot, a movie that should be seen by everyone who believes that Love , Truth and Justice must prevail. The movie is calling all the human beings in the world to come, watch, conclude that at the end of the day and despite all atrocities and unacceptable acts to deny and hide the truth of the 20st century first genocide, and despite all the attempts to demolish the truth for 102 years and until now ( e.g. Thousands of 1 star reviews and the movie was only watched by couple of hundreds ), justice , truth will prevail because Love and Divinity are the foundation of Human Race. Today Millions of Descendants of the Armenian Genocide Survivors are calling for recognition and justice, the call of those millions have been answered by a lot of countries who recognized the Armenian Genocide, those millions are watching this great movie and expressing their gratitude to almost the whole world for making such movies that will ease their daily grief of losing their land and their loved ones. A Great Director, An outstanding Love Story, A divine call for justice, Great acting and an outstanding reflection of the truth. Let us all join this journey of truth, love and divine justice so that in the future no more grief and loss will be created for other millions of people worldwide."
" A Magnificent Achievement
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"Despite receiving a multitude of negative reviews prior to its release, largely from Turkish deniers, The Promise delivered a story and portrayal of historic events in a grandiose way that accurately portrayed the events of the 1915 Genocide. (Warning this review may contain spoilers). The brilliance of the film was brought to life by an A-list acting crew featuring Oscaar Isaac (Rogue One) and Christian Bale (The Dark Knight). The film follows a medical student through his journey from a small Turkish village to Constantinople and the vast outreaches of the Ottoman Empire, where he witnesses the atrocities carried out by the Empire first hand. The film explores the impact the genocide had on the Armenian populace of Turkey. The Promise conveys the scope of the brutality with minimal use of violence and a maximum use of facts. The viewer follows the story through the eyes of a witness and gets a feel for what the events were like. The production team did a marvelous job with bringing the events and places to life as there was a tremendous amount of detail within each scene. From the humble village where our hero begins his journey to the lavish marketplaces of Constantinople, the amount of depth and richness in each scene is nothing less than breathtaking. The story-line was entertaining and followed a simple love triangle, it did a great job of furthering the plot as well as encompassing the vastness of the events that were taking place, something of a juxtaposition but with minimal complications. I would highly recommend The Promise to all moviegoers, students of history, and agents of change. It is a beautiful film with a message for humanity to see everything that we are, everything that we're capable of being, and our capacities for savagery and kindness. All proceeds of the film are donated to charity and so, in viewing this film you are not only watching the events of 1915 come to life but actively making a difference in the lives of others to prevent such events from happening again, how many other films can do that?"
" A high class portrayal of tragic times
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"Great setting, great directing and great acting. The portrayal of such a difficult historical topic has been done with high class and is a testament to the quality and professionalism conveyed by everyone who contributed to the film. The movie definitely takes you through quite a gripping story that is extremely well delivered and hits all the more deeper with the fact that everything that is portrayed is based on real events and real experiences."
" Wonderful film!
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"If you haven't seen this film yet, go see it ASAP! Educate youreselves! The Armenian genocide happened! The 400 years of Greek slavery happened. The slaughtering of Christians around the world happened and continues to happen today. Where are the textbook articles? ""The Promise"" does a great job at telling the story of how the Armenian people suffered under the Ottoman Empire Turks. Even though it was a love story, that did not take away from the history and the true story about the Armenian genocide. Go see this amazing movie and spread the word! We will not be silenced! Educate yourselves !"
" Most touching best movie about Genocide
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"First of all thanks to Kirk Krikorian for outing $$ to tell the whole world about out history and how our ancestors were murdered. This movie Promise was very unique with combining beautiful love story to true events. I really highly recommend for everyone to see this movie. The whole theater was sobbing during the movie since everyone has someone to relate to. My personal part of the movie was when they had to move the orphans to the ship in order to escape, that's how my grandpa survived when he was 7 years old. Please take your time and watch incredible story."
" A must see for all!
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"This powerful movie is a must see and long overdue! In light of the subject matter of this movie, I congratulate those few in the Hollywood elite that supported this film in any and every aspect they may have. Certainly without the late Mr. Krekorian's funding and the support of some others in the industry, this movie would never have been made or distributed.Shame on the movie critics for their fake ratings. Clearly, the critics were influenced by the risk of offending the Turkish government rather than the amazing writing, acting, and cinematography in the film.The scenes were spectacular, the actors deserve Oscar nominations and awards as does the picture.The question now is do enough Academy members have the courage to nominate the film for various categories or will the Academy again make decisions based on a political versus artistic agenda?"
" Finally a universal movie for everyone to see and recognize the tragedies that occurred in 1915 in the Ottoman Empire.
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"This is an amazing movie with amazing screen play and videography. It illustrates the story of 1915 killings with a single family and friends as you see their experience from their side of view. Although there are lot of aspects that occurred and it does not give the whole side of the story, it is still a great movie. Definitely a must watch!!"
" Extraordinary movie
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"This is the best movie I've ever seen about the Armenian Genocide vs. World War 1. I recommend everybody to watch this movie. the cast are excellent. It has a love story to show within the tragedies of the war, and in the background shows the vicious and dictatorial regime of the Ottoman Turks; to destroy, loot and kill everybody who is a Christian Armenian. Very nice movie; do not miss it. A+++"
" Awesome
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"This was an excellent movie. 5 generations of my family went together to watch. We cried, clapped at the end and sat through all the credits before we could even get up to leave. It was amazing and a story that needed to be told. I highly recommend this movie. The acting was very good and the photography was great. Overall great movie."
" Well portrayed lesson in history
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,9,"This film treats a very difficult subject of history - the Armenian Genocide that took place during the First World War - with accuracy and with as much sensitivity as possible. Beautifully shot, with lovely scenes of Constantinople, the depiction of human suffering is softened with a love story. The characters feel real and aptly portray their fear and pain. We see the 'before' and the 'after', for both the victims of the slaughter ('The Armenians are a tumor in our midst' says one Ottoman character.) and even for a young Turk trying to help his Armenian friends. The contrast between life prior to 1914 and after is stark. I would recommend this movie, particularly for anyone interested in this period of history. The tragedy was eerily repeated in World War II."
" speechless.... Loved every second of the movie
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"What an amazing movie. The actors were just all wonderful, the plot, and the music, there are just no words to describe. Please go see this movie I want everyone to educate themselves about the Armenian Genocide and this is the best way to start. Of course they could not fit the whole story in a 2 hour movie but its the best place to start. Anyway I cant give anything away but awesome movie and if I could I would give it a 1000 + starts"
" Excellent movie about the Armenian Genocide
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,8,"The Promise - movie reviewI went to see The Promise tonight. It is a remarkable telling of a love triangle story set during WWI against the background of the Armenian Genocide. The Director is Terry George who also directed Hotel Rwanda.Mikael is a young Christian Armenian in the Ottoman Empire, who travels to Constantinople to study to become a doctor. While there he meets Ana, a young Armenian socialite and her amour Chris (played by Christian Bale), an American reporter. We witness the abrupt change in Ottoman society, in which before war breaks out Constantinople is a sophisticated capital of elegance and prosperity. But with was comes violence and cruelty. The Armenian minority become the target of Turkish Muslim oppression, and pretty soon are marked for extermination. The story is very well told, and the love story does not obscure the horror of the first genocide of modern history - which the Turkish government has yet to acknowledge as such. There are several horrific scenes of the aftermath of slaughter and the death marches to the Syrian desert. I strongly recommend this movie for anyone who has any interest in human behaviour and motivations."
" Great historical drama
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"One of the best and most tragic historical dramas. I enjoyed the love triangle embedded in the story of the first genocide of the 2oth century. A genocide that inspired Hitler to commit the Jewish Holocaust. So sad that most people don't have the intelligence, attention span,and love for humanity to see this film. Instead, they will watch shitty movies like the fast and furious part 29"
" The truth behind the film..
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"The film was as breathtaking as it was heartbreaking. Knowing that this film depicted true accounts of the genocide made it difficult to watch at times. It is a must-see film especially for those who knew nothing about the Armenian Genocide.I am a 2nd generation Armenian and I have grown up around very proud, passionate Armenian people. My great-grandmother wrote a book about her life and their march to freedom. I always remember reading her words, ""the river rain red with blood"" and to see it on the screen was stunning.The love story showed the resilience of human nature. My great grandparents were married under a tree by a priest because their church had been destroyed.My only hope is that this film gets the credit it is deserved and that politics do not get in the way of that."
" Excellent
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"Tragic/controversial topic yet beautifully filmed and masterfully acted. Especially enjoyed the personal conflicts and offsetting sacrifices between the characters. Timing of this release seems perfect given the current state of similar type conflicts based on bigotry. Perhaps it will give many today something to think about. Overall, best movie I have seen this year. Congratulations to all involved."
" Beautiful movie
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"The movie is in many ways two stories in one. There is a love story among young adults who are just making their way into the world and the effect that their decisions and passions have on their families. This story by itself would have made for a great movie. Added to that is the story of the Armenian genocide. This story is told in a way that you are introduced to the horrors of the genocide but not so traumatized as to be unable to watch. It too, is a great movie on its own. The two stories woven together make for a sensational story. You will laugh, you will cry, you will be angry and you will find hope in the end. This is definitely a must see movie."
" Historical and romantic!
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"There are lot's of beautiful and touching films about the Armenian Genocide. As an Armenian, I know my history _ the pain of my nation and the great willpower of living, creating, struggling. I'm so happy that, finally, there is a film which will spread information about the historical facts and many people will have opportunity to know the truth. This film is about the people who love life,want to create, despite the all barriers they had met ever. Thank to all great actors and people who help this project come true."
" Great historical movie that would have benefited from more emotional energy
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,8,"I watched this long-awaited movie yesterday. As a historical movie, it is very well done. It represents the most essential elements accompanying the Armenian genocide, the brutality of the Ottomans exterminating the civilian Armenian population, as well as touching upon the role of the French, Americans and Germans in that context. The characters of the American journalist and the Turkish classmate of the Armenian medical student are a success.The double love triangle in the story - the romance between two young Armenians and at the same time their relations with their official partners is interesting. My favorite part is the very human relationship between the two men - Armenian doctor and American journalist in love with the same woman. However, the movie is missing high level of emotional energy and therefore, doesn't have the expected emotional impact. There are scenes in the movie that are either not well thought or not well played. For instance, when Anna sees Michael while thinking for a while that he is dead, she just stands up, walks to him and hugs him. The whole scene with the train and especially the fall of Michael to the river is needless and could be cut. There are other scenes like that - missed opportunities for the director and actors to turn it into a drama with a big emotional impact. It is also possible that we, Armenians, have exaggerated expectations from a movie about our genocide, and it will have a bigger emotional impact on foreigners. For us, we know it all, for them, it is mostly new.Overall, a good combination of a historical movie with the right amount of romance."
" It's a Great movie that every human should see
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"This is a great movie, based on historic events, that tells the truth , which was denied for many years. You'll see the history of human lives and entire nation, which can never be hidden, forgotten or denied. I think every human should see this movie to learn the truth and to prevent anything like that to happen again #keepthepromise #neverdeny #neveragain"
" It has a message to make people understand that no matter what religion,skin color,social positions we have,we all are HUMAN BEINGS...
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"''The Promise'' is not just a movie made for entertainment...It's a great movie that describes the feelings of people who lost everything besides their pride and hope during Armenian GENOCIDE of 1915...It has a message to make people understand that no matter what religion,skin color,social positions we have,we all are HUMAN BEINGS...The positive and negative things were described so clear that we could see and feel with actors what is true love,friendship and even cruelty...The scenes,the music,the actors were really great. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie..)"
" Great movie. Everybody must know the truth!
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"A great movie that everybody should go and see in the theaters. It is very sad that today we live in a world where injustice prevails over what is right and what we should all accept. The Armenian Genocide is a historical fact and there is more than enough proof of it. Things of this importance should not be a question of international relationships between countries and simply should be accepted by everyone in the world, so that it does not lead to any other atrocious acts by radical leaders."
" Very touching, realistic and engaging movie
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,10,"A powerful movie which reveals the big truth about Armenian Genocide of 1915. A movie that brings strong message to the world! This film is truly worth watching!!! The scenario is really catchy and exciting, the characters are very attractive, emotional and strong, the music is charming. Great performance of actors and the historical truth behind it makes this movie really perfect choice for people who value the art of movie-making!!!"
" Would watch it again
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,10,"This was a phenomenal movie. Not knowing much about the topic of the Armenian Genocide, this movie had me leaving the theater wanting to learn more about what happened. Shocking that such a calamity of this magnitude goes denied by the Turks. Seems to be a real stain on their history which has resulted in the lack of advancement and modernization in the nation."
" Well done tackling a difficult topic. Definitely a should be seen.
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,8,"It's not easy tackling a tragedy like genocide and reaching broad audiences, but this film does bring a human face to the impact of these terrible events from 100 years ago. While not the gut wrenching versions of this story seen in the past, The Promise, does a very effective job of retelling actual historical events through the experiences of three very realistic characters. These types of people actually experienced similar types of events. The commitment of the actors to the characters they play clearly comes through. Likewise, Director Terry George takes big risks in his portrayal of actual historical individuals from the era. I left the theater satisfied that someone new to this topic would walk away with knowledge they didn't have before, and a film experience that told the story of three individuals caught up in different kinds of love all at the same time. Well worth the watch."
" Heartfelt honest movie about the Armenian genocide
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,10,"This film is extremely well executed. The cinematography is beautiful. The movie is well written and well acted. I was particularly taken with how human all of the characters are. I cried, but I also laughed. I think the film makers worked very hard on making the film relate-able and the certainly succeeded. I highly recommend it."
" Excellent Movie - A Must See
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,10,"A well balanced historical drama film that highlights the truth behind Armenian genocide. Well done Kirk Kerkorian god bless you for founding it. I Loved the entire movie, the ending song, and the excellent cast. We waited a long time for this movie to come out. This barbaric event happened 102 years ago."
" Clearly Turks Are Still Embarrassed
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,10,"Reading recent reviews of the movie, clearly Turks are still embarrassed by the sinister activities of their ancestors. Alleged stories from ""Turkish relatives who were there"" and know the truth are fables. The truth is in the movie. The Turkish Government planned and orchestrated a genocide, with the use of their army. Some kind Turkish citizens stepped up and helped save a few Armenians. It is refreshing that the current Turks are embarrassed and want to hide the evil that is their history. Sadly, they are rewriting a new history, that includes a new evil."
" Stunning film, beyond my expectations.
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,10,"I don't typically write movie reviews, but since there's been a campaign to bury it by genocide deniers, I felt like I really ought to.In short: it was good. There's nothing I can specifically complain about. Acting, and writing were solid. Cinematography was good at doing what it tried to do, like conveying emotion, or just showing a really beautiful shot.What I can talk about is things I thought were especially good. I was impressed with how relatable the movie is. Obviously I can only speak for myself there, but I feel that the characters in the movie provided someone that anybody could relate to. Armenians can obviously relate. But there are also outsiders and Turkish sympathizers who the audience can connect with, and do an excellent job of taking said audience member through the events from their perspective. In addition, the film did a good job of capturing some very subtle, nuanced reactions to the situation the characters found themselves in, which also makes them more relatable simply by making them more human.Secondly, while the movie focuses on Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, it did make mention of the suffering of the Assyrian and Greek populations, as well. I think we can't complain, as Armenians, that we're forgotten while we ourselves forget others who were targeted as well.So, I recommend it. Even beyond just watching a good movie, by doing so, you are standing up for truth against an organized campaign of lies, and helping worthy causes because proceeds for the movie are going to a variety of humanitarian non- profits."
" Well worth seeing
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,10,"an eye opening true story about a very sad time in history, the Armenian Genocide. It is a compelling drama set at the start of WWI, that tells the story of the senseless slaughter of well over a million Armenians by the Ottoman Turks. The story is told through the fictional lives of three people involved in a moving love triangle. Don't READ THE REVIEWS. There is a movement underway to destroy this movie by people who don't want the truth to be told. All I can say is see this movie for yourself. You won't be sorry. It has a lot to offer, fabulous cinematography, excellent acting, great settings, and most importantly it teaches us about an event in history we should all know about."
" Great Movie, Turks are afraid of the truth
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,10,"I ma very proud, that I am ARMENIAN and very proud there is a movie coming out about the Armenian genocide. My great grandparent's relatives survived this genocide and went through hell. It is a shame that the Turks are brain washed and in denial about something so cruel their people did. I also noticed a lot of those in denial are making horrible reviews to sway people's opinions to see the movie. Just horrible. Go see the movie for yourself to see the TRUTH!"
" Fulfilled my thirst for a Great movie.
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"Great job Director, you realize from the beginning a lot of thought has been put into making of this movie. You really experience what the actors are going through, you are watching a movie that matters, a movie which is based on the Armenian Genocide. It's not a movie you watch and you forget about, its a movie that brings questions in your heart mind and soul. It brings awareness to human rights issues, political issues, love issues, family issues, etc. I'm really happy that film makers still create movies that present real issues. Thank you to Christian Bale, Oscar Issac, for there devotion to the film. The film portrayed accurately the events that took place in the Armenian Genocide. I urge people to watch this film, and research on the Armenian Genocide."
" Amazing Powerful Movie
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie was AWESOME! I recommend all go see it. Take some tissues, its heart wrenching. It brings to light the great tragedy of the Armenian Genocide, a testament to remind us of just how far human cruelty and savagery can go. I hope Turkey and those responsible for the genocide will ADMIT to it, and make amends or ask to be forgiven somehow,....to let healing and restoration be, for this tragic crime of the past. This movie will serve to inspire and awaken us all to NEVER let a tragedy like this ever occur again, and for all humanity to learn to live in peace with one another, to serve one another, so we may all prosper together. Thank You.http://www.genocide1915.info/"
" Superbly Relevant!
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"Being a direct descendant from an Armenian family that lived in and left Turkey, this movie is a wonderful acknowledgment of past historical events that were always relevant but suppressed. I was never taught to dislike the Turkish culture - all I knew is that my Mom and Grandmother could speak perfect Armenian and Turkish. Thank you to the makers of this movie - you showed how human persecution is the lowest form of existence for any society. We all do better when ideas and cultures share and acknowledge our contributions to one another."
" Great Movie
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"I found this movie so sad but so needed to be out. The acting was unbelievable and the story line, although underplayed, to save the audience from the horrific real life photos of the Genocide , still was able to make a point. Turkey need to recognize and admit and stop denying. I will make it a point to see this movie again with my children."
" What a GREAT MOVIE!!!
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"The movie was spectacular, the cast was superb. A movie like this should have been made many years ago and many times over (as many times as one has seen a movie about the Jewish Holocaust, just as many should have been made about the ARMENIAN GENOCIDE/HOLOCAUST). Must see movie for all ages, it's pure history, i wished the movie showed a lot more of the truth behind the genocide so people can actually learn and be aware of what the Ottoman Empire (that is Turkish people for you millenniums that have not studied in school or are even aware of) has done to the ARMENIAN PEOPLE (INCLUDING TO MY GREAT GRANDPARENTS). As long as we are alive, we the PROUD ARMENIANS will educate the entire world about the atrocious crime that the Turks have done to poor innocent Christian people. I love the movie and it was long overdue. I wish, Amazon Prime, Netflix and Showtime will invest in making more movies/series of episodes on their networks."
" Revealing the truth
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,I was a great movie. Finally everyone can know about brutal Turkish Genocide against Armenians. I couldn't stop crying. I remembered everythink my grandmother used to tell us about that days. How they hide and dreamt about food. Armenian people speed all around the world after this massacre. After all the Turkey doesn't recognize The Genoside. The death of 1.5 million innocent people. I believe one they will be punished by God.
" A beautiful film that packs a serious punch
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"This is a powerhouse of a film, lavishly filmed and historically accurate.The subject matter is particularly relevant, concerning events in the Middle East today. This is also an instructive film, serving as a blueprint for the larger scale events of WWII and for the many genocides committed since. Many of the major personalities of the time were included. The music is spectacular as is the filmography. Notable real life persons, such as US Ambassador Henry Morgenthau, embodiment of what a US diplomat should be."
" Good Performances In Historical Drama
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,8,"I would liken this film to Dr. Zhivago in that it covers a romance against a backdrop of the horrific crimes that take place, in this case the last days of the Ottoman Empire against the Christian Armenian population. There are great performances - Oscar Isaac as Mikael and Marwan Kenzari were standouts to me. A bit long but it does bring into focus the various elements of the times that are important to note - the systematic rounding up of clergy, business people, leaders of the Armenian minority to decapitate any leadership from organizing resistance; the resistance at Musa Dagh and rescue from the French; the friendships that did exist between the Turks and Armenians prior to these events. Ultimately, it's a historical drama that should resonate with people as we watch other nations still perpetrating the same crimes against minorities and often against their own peoples. We need to learn from history."
" The Promise
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,As a student of history For more than 50 years I have known about the Turkish genocide of Albanians. It has long colored my opinion of the Turks. If they had a decent government they would have long ago admitted what they did to the Albanians.But the fact is that Turkey has never had the decency to admit what they did. The government of Turkey is today a dictatorship and unworthy of respect. Erdogon has no respect for Human Rights and I hope somewhere along the way he will get his just deserts. As for Turks every Turk can be judged by whether they acknowledge what their government did to the Albanians.
" Very good but far from perfect film
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"A beautifully shot movie that multitasks to combine a love story, political and war themes such as nationalism, fascism, humanitarianism , friendship/loyalty, etc. using the backdrop of the beginning of WW1 and of course atrocities committed to the Armenian people by the Turkish army.Despite some clichéd' narrative choices regarding the intertwined ""love story"" I would say this is a very good film - not ""Oscar Worthy"" but still very good with a excellent cast and equally solid acting throughout. The film covers a lot of ground over it's 2+hr run time touching on many themes as mentioned above but the problem for me was that all these ideas did not always organically tie together. By trying to do too much the overall impact of some critical moments lacked tension. The films overall message is somewhat diluted because of this as well. If I had to I would probably rate The Promise a 8.0 out of 10. This is a film I would certainly recommend seeing and one that I would watch again.The reason I'm giving a 10/10 excellent score is to help counter the Holocaust denying trolls that attacked this film before it was even released. - Which ironically helps promote the movie that these people are trying to smear."
" powerful, poignant, stays in my mind still
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,8,"Saw it at advance screening 24 April.The scenes in Constantinople are seductive, in contrast with what is to follow. The love plot is far from being a banal triangle, as some describe it, but a subtle psychological drama, faithful to the background of time and place. A powerful, gripping film, with some of the most dramatic scenes I've ever seen. So poignant, I was in tears. Still stays with me. Don't miss it."
" Beautiful Film
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"The best film I've seen in years. The cinematography is beautiful though the story is, of course, tragic. Casting with Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon was genius. The negative reviews are clearly an attempt to suppress this film and I do hope they are not successful. The film deserves broad recognition and the Armenian genocide should not fade from our memory."
" Bravo! A must see movie for all
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"The Promise was an excellent movie, tastefully done. As a descendant ofsurvivors of the Armenian Genocide, I applaud Kirk Kerkorian, for his generosity and commitment to the Armenian people, to the director and to the amazing cast, who did a beautiful job of finally showing the world what the Armenian people have endured. It shall never be forgotten. Bravo!!!!"
" World class movie
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"This film will not disappoint you, and will not be a waste of your money! One of the best movies i've seen! The 90 million budget is obvious throughout the entire film. Acting is top level, sets are amazing. The story line is unpredictable and captivating. It's been a long time since a movie of this class and caliber last came out."
" Thanks for the great movie
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"Just returned from watching at theatre. Wonderful movie. Great play by all the A star actors. Special thanks to Oscar Isaac for showing the emotional world of every single Armenian. Meanwhile showing the love story of two different angles, movie was able to deliver the message of all survivors that ""you can't destroy a generation"". We will create ""New Armenia"". Remember!"
" A True Classic
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"This is one of my favorite movies of the year so far, and has that classic ""Dr Zhivago"" feel, but with modern production that is crisp, alive & real - like you are experiencing the story right as it happens. I love movies based on true events in history, and I'm feel so privileged to now have insight into a piece of history that I had no idea existed. The importance of this movie cannot be overstated. With a timeless message, it was also cinematic, brilliantly acted, gripping and powerful. I also loved how tastefully done it was -- no graphic exploitation. Just pure classic story-telling at its best. Do not miss this movie on the big screen!!"
" Human love story amid WWI catastrophe
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,Great glimpses of a turn of the century Constantinople in this period piece. The stories expressed in this film were commonplace among Armenians expelled from their ancestral homelands.The breakup of the Ottoman Empire leaves us with many social and cultural artifacts still seen in today's world. Pay attention to the religious undertones to understand what is happening in the middle east. Pay attention to the nationalist overtones to understand what is happening in every other country in today's world.Turkey had an opportunity to really be a model multicultural pluralistic society but was blinded by the false promises of ruthless nationalism and self worship. Add a deliberately uneducated populace and...
" Excellent Movie Based on Facts of Barbaric Acts of Turks
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"It was very hard for me to watch this movie, because as I was watching it I pictured my grandfather when he used to tell us with teary eyes what he went through as a child during the Armenian genocide. He lost his parents, sisters and brothers as they were killed in front of his own eyes when he was only six years old and was taken away by some kurds as a servant. He grew up among them, but he was determined to go back to his village. At the age of sixteen he managed to escape and went back to his village, but he couldn't find anyone from his family, and no Armenians at all. Luckily he found very few Armenians that were protected by American Missionary and met my grandmother who was saved at a nearby village. That is how I know that the movie was based on actual event from the tragic history of Armenians. I congratulate all who made this tragic history of Armenians finally come to life as the Turkish government worked very hard to cover up their barbaric acts all these years. Please go see the movie and write a review about it as the Turks are still fighting to deny it with their bad and fake reviews. No matter what they did, Armenians will continue to survive and tell the truth to the world."
" Epic
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,7,"If you've studied WWI a bit, you'll know that while the Ottoman Empire was crumbling a group called the ""Young Turks"" decided that Turkey would rid itself of everyone not Turkish. If you agreed to convert to Islam, you might be spared. So much happened and on such a large scale that you could easily do a mini-series, so the film is a little long and some conflation of things was necessary. It is not unrealistic that Armenians could escape from one situation and then simply find themselves driven from one horror to another. Yes, some Armenians were worked to death by the military, some escaped and tried to hide out, and yes, a few thousand were rescued off of Musa Dagh (a mountain), close to the Mediterranean Sea. Bottom line, this film manages to convey the horror of being hated simply for who you are and targeted for extermination. Oscar Isaac is just phenomenal, and the rest of the cast is very good. The incredible atrocities are played down, fact is if they showed the viewer even 15% of what happened in detail, it would make it hard to attract viewers. The genocide against Armenians, Assyrians, Greeks and other non-Turks is well documented and supported by historians in general. It's a historical fact. The only historians who try to downplay or deny there was a genocide are usually being supported financially by the Turkish government. Those who did not die were largely women/girls who were handed off to Turkish families. I would guess that a large portion of Turks do in fact have an Armenian grandmother or great grandmother. After years of the Turkish government threatening the diaspora and attacking anyone who insisted that this happened, it is extremely heartening that this film has been made."
" Beautiful, romantic and epic movie. It told me a lot I do not know
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"If you like Dr Zhivago, you will love this movie. It has the same epic flow, the intense love story, and a perspective on history. You will learn a lot, but it is also very entertaining. I understand from other reviews that many trolls have deliberately added negative ratings, in a manner that is disproportionate in every way. For example, the movie seems to have too many reviews for the time it has been released. I am inclined to agree with these comments that there is a campaign of disinformation by the Turks about this movie., since Turkey denies that the Armenian Holocaust took place. Go see it. Not all Turks are presented as evil in the movie. Quite the contrary. Many tried to do the right thing, against their own families and the government. However, once a dictatorial and amoral power sets in a society, all kinds of crimes are committed by rulers against their own people, and against minorities of all kinds. This is a disease of all human societies that we have not learned to eradicate.The acting is excellent, especially the three main protagonists, as well as the recreation of a beautiful world that has disappeared. Turkey is a now peculiar state, tottering between barbarism and civilization, and I mean internally within its own culture. We can see how this can take place. If the Turks do not accept their own historical errors, they are bound to repeat them."
" A great story with important historical reflections
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"The Promise was a beautifully told story of the Armenian Genocide. The first holocaust of the 20th Century. A story long overdue in telling on the international screen. The story reflects on a love story occurring in the heart of the Genocide. It reflects the resilience of the Armenian people, their faith, their love of their lands, culture and tradition. It tells the story of friendship and honor, loyalty between a young Armenian and Young Turk. The setting reflects historical Armenia as well as the Ottoman Empire. Although the film was filled mostly in Spain, it does a great job comparing the lands to that of Armenia and Turkey. The sound track for the film was done tastefully! I can't wait to order it!!!! I encourage everyone to see this film.. Not as Armenians but the passion of mankind. That we cannot continue to allow genocides to happen."
" A powerful movie about love and tragedy during the Armenian Genocide.
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"""After ""Ararat"", ""The Promise"" is the other only major production of the movie industry of North America about the Armenian Genocide. It is a very important movie on the market of a country with a critical influence in the world. The United States has not yet properly acknowledged the first genocide of the 20th Century to avoid antagonizing the host of one of its military bases - Turkey. The government of the Ottoman Turkish Empire organized the extermination of more than 1.5 million Armenians starting in April 1915. In my view the movie was made to introduce the facts of the Armenian Genocide and has mainly educational value. It was made with the objective to present and inform about the biggest tragedy in the history of the modern Armenian people, not to strike its audiences with the horrors of mass killing and the unspeakable methods of violence more than 100 years ago. It is a movie production that most likely will not be nominated for Oscars, but is one of the most important films I, the son of the Armenian genocide survivors, have seen in my life."
" An moving love story set during the Armenian Genocide
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,8,"The film is very well done, although much of the details about the Genocide and its background are missing. It is really a love triangle that is intertwined with an account of one the greatest acts of man's inhumanity to man. The Istanbul of 1914 was a cosmopolitan city with multiple ethnic groups living together. As World War I was starting, Turkey was engulfed with a fanatical desire for Turkification and the Turkish leaders' grand scheme of establishing a Pan-Turkik empire reaching Central Asia. As a result, most Armenian intellectuals, artists and writers were executed in the early days and entire Armenian village were decimated. Men, women and children were marched through hot deserts of Syria and shot if they couldn't make it.The movie ends with an excerpt from a famous book called, ""Forty Days of Musa Dagh,"" by the German writer Franz Werfel that details how a group of about 4,000 Armenian refugees fought off the Turkish hordes for forty days until they were rescued by a French navy ship."
" Excellent movie, very moving
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie was a pleasant surprise. It was interesting, dramatic, suspenseful, moving and overall a movie I would consider to be one of the best fact based films I've seen. The characters are raw and the acting is superb. The cinematography is also well done. This is a must see!!!"
" Beautiful Love Story in an historic horrific event, the Armenian Genocide
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"It is always hard to combine love story in a historic, tragic events. The producer did a great job showing the viewers the horrific event during WW - 1 that killed millions of innocent Armenians by Turkish government and later the massacres became known as Armenian Genocide. However, to make the movie easy on viewers the love story between a doctor and an Armenian woman makes it very romantic to watch. There are some inaccuracies; like the weapons used by Turks against Armenians; however, the scene about the Musa Dagh resistance documented by French and US is accurate, although they could have made it longer part of the movie."
" Incredible film
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"The film is incredible. It truly captures the life, the love, and the pain of the Armenian people during the genocide. I encourage everyone to watch it, and become knowledgeable about this tragic incident that destroyed 1.5 million innocent Armenians. The actors captured the true essence of the souls of us Armenians."
" 1 star reviews are jealous Turks
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"Don't even be bothered to read reviews with 1 star. These are troll Turks who came here to boycott and lower the ratings. This is unavoidable. But what Armenians do? Just like in the movie....we survive. Armenian genocide is real and there is plenty of evidence out there. Clever people, even clever Turkish people admitted this. But of course countries don't want to lose good ties with Turkey so they won't speak a word of truth."
" Beautifully Told Heart-Breaking Story
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"The Promise is a must-see for audiences of all ages, as it tells a story of the tragedy of the Armenian Genocide through the eyes of a young man, the main character Mikael. It is foremost a love story, but also accurately and tastefully conveys the reality and horrors faced by the Armenians who lived in the Ottoman Empire during that time. This movie will have you feeling elated, hopeful, shocked, and devastated all within a matter of just over 2 hours. Yes, it is an emotional roller-coaster, but one you be glad that you rode. I would eagerly see it again!"
" Excellent Movie!
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"Excellent portrayal of the real life events pertaining to the Armenian Genocide. It includes a love story, with good character portrayal and development. Christian Bale does an amazing job as an American reporter. I recommend this movie to anyone who would like to learn about history, while being entertained at the same time. And 100% of the profits go to charity-something that has never been done before!"
" Great movie
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"Well directed movie during sad and horrific times when one of the first genocides was committed by a country that until this day fails to accept it. Despite it being very heavy and emotional, it is very interesting to watch as it involves a love triangle. One of the rare movies of today that actually has substance rather than being just all about action and glamour. Must watch movie of the year."
" Heartbreaking, Heroic and Educational
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"I've seen this film three times now and will be watching it again. Each time, I gain something more. The actors are wonderful and the story line is epic.I recommend this film to anyone who wants to gain something from a movie that will last them a lifetime. This movie entertains and educates at the same time, and will leave you contemplating many things, which is a good thing if you want to grow as a human."
" Great Movie
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie was heart warm, with love that got torn apart by tragedy. It is about time the truth is being shown to others about the Armenian Genocide and their journeys. We as a human race, need to accept and stop these behaviors and learn from history. It's time to own up and admit what has happened to the Armenian community, especially with so many lives taken and so much time that has past. The movie is a must see."
" Great Must See Movie
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,This is a great movie to see for all history and drama buffs. It is set during WWI in Ottoman Empire. It is historically accurate and tells a story about a topic which is still to this day is fairly unknown to most people. It is about the first Genocide of the 20th century and how it shaped the lives of the Armenian people. A very powerful movie that everyone should see.
" excellent film - go see it
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,Contrary to the organized campaign to denigrate this movie - this is a film worth seeing. It has a touching love story unfolding in the rapidly changing environment of Ottoman Turkey during WW1. The love story contrasts with the rising terror as the Ottoman Turks decide to scapegoat the Armenians and other minorities. The terror brings out bravery and humanity in some that is inspiring. See the movie.
" This movie should be seen by all
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"Beautifully shot film that tackles a topic that unfortunately has not been brought up to light enough even after 102 years. I really like the way the director has went ahead to capture the horror and pain but yet keep the cinematography and imagery on a level that is not gruesome or overly graphic, which makes the film suitable for educational purposes. So I hope this will be seen by many people, especially younger audiences to learn more of this forgotten and dusty era of WW1.Great cast with great performances, I can totally see Oscar Isaac getting an Oscar nomination for this, maybe even win one. Amazing actor and I think Oscar deserves Oscar. All in all, definitely worth a watch, it's absolutely crazy that these events actually happened and has been ignored far too long. The consequences of that apathy from the rest of the world is very clear when we look at modern day Turkey and what is going on right now in Syria/Iraq/Turkey."
" Breathtaking Movie - READ REAL REVIEWS BEFORE DECIDING TO WATCH! Every single person should go and watch this film!
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"Yes, I am Armenian. Yes, I am proud of it. No, I did not give the movie a 10-star rating and am not writing this review because of the previous 2 facts. Actually, I waited until I watched the movie to leave an objective review. This movie is about a love triangle with the backdrop of the Armenian Genocide. In my honest opinion, it was beautiful. The only thing wrong with the movie, which I do not hold against it, is it did not show enough, or how cruel the ottoman turks were to the Armenians. It was in fact far worse and far more than what the movie depicts. However, this movie was funded by the legendary Kirk Kerkorian in order to educate the world about the Armenian Genocide and be shown in schools. Genocide deniers (unfortunately, not all of them are turks) give this film low ratings and bad reviews in order to deter people from watching (worried about something??). There is an overwhelming amount of evidence the Armenian Genocide took place. Simply google New York Times Armenian Genocide to see some of the articles published. WATCH THE MOVIE! Don't pay attention to these bad ratings from people that have not even watched the movie! Don't pay attention to the box office results either because it is a result of those bad ratings. Movie makers never cared to make money on this film, and IN FACT, ALL MOVIE PROCEEDS ARE BEING DONATED TO CHARITY!!!!Now, if that is not another reason for you to watch this movie, I don't know what is."
" A Very Worthwhile Movie
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,9,"This movie deals with genocide, which of course is a hideous crime that in the hands of certain other film makers (I'm looking at you, Mel Gibson) could make for a very gory, violent and disgusting movie. This film shows enough for viewers to get the picture, without going overboard. You can take the teens and grandparents to this one without worrying that it will be too shocking, or contain too much sex.American audiences in particular should see this, as our WWI understanding tends to be overshadowed by WWII. This film depicts a particularly brutal aspect of that war and should lead viewers to asking more questions and gaining a better understanding of what can happen when war comes. The Armenian genocide holds lessons that are valuable today."
" Must Watch!
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,"My husband and I watched this film last night and will be bring our teen and friends with us to watch it again. It was beautiful and POWERFUL a story to be told and retold for generations, so few know about this period in history, thanks to the Turkey and their denial and control in media. The writter of this film, knew that production of this film would be risky, he fully funded the film on his own, if that meant getting the truth out There! Please watch and support this film, as 100% of proceeds earned goes to human rights causes and organizations helping to restore history."
" Entertaining as well as a lesson in history
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,9,"My mother's first husband died on Musa Dagh and the film was very special to me. The visual effects were stunning and the love story had an ending that fit the dark side of the time. There were many Turks and Kurds, including Turkish officials who helped Armenians and who refused to carry out the ""deportation"" orders, but the Turkish government continues to indoctrinate their children with lies, hiding the truth, and perpetuating denial. This film will serve to put another crack in the Turkish wall of denial."
" Great movie
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,This is an excellent movie taking place during the Armenian genocide it is a great story about love and the hardship of life during that time Armenians had to survive. I wish it showed more of what the Turks had done it was much more brutal and Gory mass slaughter which I'm sure would've never made it to the big screens if we showed the entire truth but overall it was very sad I felt everyone in the movie theater cried and don't listen to the negative reviews left here they are all left I'm sure by Turks trying to demonize this film and make sure it is not worth while but even if I was not Armenian I would still say this was a great movie which you will all enjoy
" true Life
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"First- I want to state that I have not seen the movie. However, my husband and I will be viewing it with friends over the weekend. There has been tremendous controversy surrounding this movie. But, how can anyone judge something that they've never watched before? Anyway, my point is of different perspective. My husband is Armenian, from Yerevan, and I'm Jewish, from the former Soviet Union. Religion has never been a concern in our marriage or family. This isn't about our religion or culture.What doesn't make any sense, is why the Turkish people won't accept and make amends with their wrong doing. When Life is Beautiful was released,Schindler List, The Pianist, The boy in the Striped Pajamas...Anyway, you get the point. These are all Jewish and World War 2 (holocaust based movies) we didn't have Germans stand up and create negativity around it. Nor did we have anyone stand up and say anything! Bottom line is- Don't be fooled by Pro-Turkish commentators or anyone else with a two sentences for a negative comment. This move is about the loss of over a million innocent Armenian men, women, and children who were tragically killed by the ottoman Turkish empire in the early 1900's, obviously there's more to it then that. However, that is one of the center themes of the movie. Just go see it, with an open mind and allow yourself to be the judge of why or why not you enjoyed the move."
" Finally
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Finally a movie that is well financed, well produced with great actors and actresses. Very happy with the whole thing. Turks .... face the fact and learn your real history and recognize what your government and three lunatic pashas really did. Also many many thanks to Kirk Krikorian."
" Could have been better, but still a must see one!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,7,"It's definitely something huge what Hollywood launched lately; #ThePromise, though could have been better as a movie piece, portrays the terror and grief that people suffered during the Armenian Genocide. We should all watch it, whether Armenians or not, because it shows a little part of what really happened."
" Great movie!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Excellent movie, a must see! It's a little bit long (over 2 hours) but it's worth it. Great acting and interesting story. It's not just a love story but also showing inhumane policies of Turkish government committed against Armenian population living in Ottoman Empire at the time. There are of course, thousands of documentaries, eye witnesses, historians, all supporting these horrific atrocities. The movie manages to point all this and more yet make it tolerable for the viewer to learn about this dark period. I recommend this to all. Enjoy the movie!"
" Masterpiece
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Great movie. Must see! Reminds of great people in history, a crime against humanity and how few brave can make a world of difference. The quality of the plot and the cast is simply incredible. I highly recommend to everyone this great movie. It is worth all ten stars. The music that was specially written for the movie is also amazing. It is great to see that famous actors came together to show the ugly truth from history and a crime for which no one truly paid the price yet. I hope this movie will inspire generations of Armenians to continue fighting for justice and truth."
" great start to recognition
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,9,"I am so proud to be Armenian, and see a movie about my ancestor's tragedy. Shame on turkey and all who deny! The movie does a good job depicting the genocide, of course I would love to see a movie in the future with the Armenian genocide as the focal point and not just the backdrop of a love story, but very good start. Thank you Kirk Krikorian for helping Armenians so much and may you R.I.P This is a step forward to one day gaining world recognition."
" A must see !
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I have seen the movie 2 times over the weekend . Once with my kids and then I took some of my relatives .Even my 13 yr old son saw it again, by choice ! It is a must see movie suitable for not only adults as well as early teens. The story-line was beautifully incorporated into the tragic atrocities committed by the Ottoman Turk government against the Armenians during WWI . I highly recommend this movie to be seen !"
" Excellent movie
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"The Promise is an excellent movie that is historically accurate. I'm rarely moved by films but this one had a deep impact. I'd seen the black and white pictures, shown during the final credits, in DC at an Armenian organization nearly fifteen years ago and they are still as powerful as ever. Go see this movie."
" A historically accurate movie
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie in Denver, CO. Having read many history books on the subject, as well as Fraz Werfel's Musa Dagh novel (which itself was based on eye-witness accounts), Ambassador Morgenthau's memoirs, and contemporary reportage from the New York Times microfilm archives of the paper's editions from the time of the Armenian Genocide, I found the movie to be accurate in its depiction of the historical events surrounding the fictional love story. The Armenians -- as well as the Greeks and the Assyrians -- were wiped out from their ancestral homeland by the Ottoman Turks and yet, in spite of the untold number of eye-witness accounts, reports, and photographs, modern Turkey is still engaged in shameful, denialist and, at times -- as in the case of the 55,000 negative reviews published here even before the movie was released -- stupidly childish propaganda. I highly recommend this movie, if nothing else, as a way to learn about the first genocide of the 20th Century and to thus honor the memory of the 1.5 million souls who perished in the most horrifying manner."
" Keep the promise
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Amazing and very emotional movie about love, true friendship and an important piece of history that have been silent for a century. The constant denial of the crimes committed by the Ottoman Empire in Turkey in 1915, is not only insult to Armenian people, but it's something we all must know so we are not doomed to repeat it. Great actors and actresses, such a powerful movie. Thank you to every single one of you who made this happen, in this incredible Oscar worthy movie, God bless you all!!!"
" This review describes why I think the movie received bad reviews, and why that is unfortunate.
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"The fact that this movie is receiving such negative reviews saddens me. This movie was one of the best written and acted movies I have ever seen, with top notch performances from Oscar Isaac and Christian Bale. It tells the story of a strong people that were determined to survive, and did against all odds. Anyone who thinks poorly of this film is either lying to themselves, or is influenced by Turkish propaganda. This shows that the Turkish government is still as inhumane and evil as they were portrayed in this movie. To slaughter men and women in front of their children is bad enough, but to deny it 100 years later makes you sink to another level. They can deny it all you want, but the historical records will always be there."
" Amazing epic movie
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"One of the best historical romance movies. If you loved Doctor Zhivago, you'll love this!!!!!!!!! The director Terry George as usual did an excellent job of bringing such a sad story to the big screen. The historical part of the movie was presented very tastefully and made the characters seem like they were part of your own family. Fantastic acting by Oscar Isaac, Christian Bale and Charlotte Le Bon. The music was haunting and yet beautiful. It's the kind of movie you want to see over and over."
" history
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"a glimpse into what happen to the Armenian people in the early 1900's which many do not recognize and was little reported . A love story, history , and genocide . Much of the world did not know or want to help . Great acting with major stars . A story that yearns to be told . Human struggles within a regime that stopped at nothing ."
" An important historical depiction of atrocities
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie depicts an historical event that is rarely taught in schools. The movie softens the atrocities that occurred at the start of WWI by the Ottoman Turks against Christian Armenians, widely acknowledged as the first genocide of the 20th century. The truth would be too horrible and graphic for most people to watch."
" Great cinematography
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Great cinematography, Good cast, the story line, the music, the costumes and the beautiful scenes of Anatolia. I saw twice and I would like to see again..Terry George thank you, you have gone beyond and above as a director. Also, great performance both by Christian Bale and Oscar Isaac. It is both educational and enlightening.. Kudos to all"
" High-quality production that speaks the truth about genocide
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Fantastic movie; the acting, scenery, and historical accuracy were spot on. It highlights the massacre and near annihilation of a Christian minority at the hands of the crumbling Ottoman Empire. I actually have many Turkish friends that have told me that schools in Turkey deny that this event actually took place and that you can go to jail in Erdogan's Turkey if you ""insult Turkishness"". I really hope that this movie raises awareness for those unaware of what took place, so such a genocide never takes place ever again."
" Loved this movie
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I loved everything about this movie. All the actors were exceptional especially Oscar Issac, throughout the entire movie. He made you live through all the scenes. It was hard to believe that he is actually not of Armenian descent. His performance is defiantly Oscar worthy. My grandparents and uncle survived the Genocide and I am very proud to say that as an Armenian I was very moved by the way the story line was done. I wholeheartedly recommend that everyone see The Promise whether you are Armenian or not, it is a part of history that has been and is still being denied."
" Excellent movie
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Me and my husband watched The Promise on 04/23/2017 at West Oaks AMC movie theater in Ocoee, Florida. I liked the movie very much. It is very well done, - all the script, the actors, the music is perfect. I wanted to specifically acknowledged the role of the producer Kirk Kerkorian who unfortunately did not make it to see the movie complete. I cried at the end, and my emotional output was applause that was doubled and tripled by the audience! I am Armenian. My husband's great grandfather and great grandmother were killed during the genocide. My husband's grandfather Sedrak Mikaelian had survived the genocide along with his brother Vahan. This is a story that most of Armenians have carry out through their lives. It is very important that people around the world watch the movie like that about Armenian genocide. It is important that Arminian genocide be recognized by Turks and Turkish government. That way there is a hope that genocide will not happen again. God bless Armenia, God bless Armenians!"
" Beautifully shot film!!!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"The Promise, was a beautifully shot film with all the elements of a great love story taking place within the Armenian Genocide. The movie does a great job shedding light to this time in history that's rarely talked about and has still been denied as a genocide for 102 years.This is a film everyone needs to see!!"
" A Wonderful Movie: Go See It!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,9,"This review does not contain spoilers!I am a little disturbed by the number of negative reviews on this film. Differences of opinion about cinematography or acting is one thing. But to have so many Turkish people give a film low ratings to discourage people from learning about the Armenian Genocide is another.I highly recommend anyone to see this film. My whole family went to see it. The violence for the most part occurs off-screen. My seven-year-old was not disturbed by the scenes. To the contrary, he was motivated to ask questions. I particularly liked that the film showed that Turks and Armenians lived side by side normally for a long time. They worked in the marketplace and the school systems and were friends with one another. An extreme sense of nationalism and a sense of license to carry out an ethnic cleansing under the cover of war changed that, but not for everyone. The historical accuracy of the film is quite good, portraying what really happened to the Armenians. The cinematography keeps the movie's pacing mostly unnoticeable. Only twice during the 134-minute film did I check my watch. And Isaac's and Bale's acting talents are on full display here. I admit that I also liked Marwan Kenzari's character, who injects a believable levity and gravitas at appropriate points in the film.The only thing I really felt was forced was the love triangle in the film. At times it felt like it was layered onto the plot rather than being an organic part of it. Parts of it were entirely believable, so I do not feel that the lapses in this aspect of the film deserve more than the loss of one star.The bottom line is: Go see the film. Don't let a group of people who simply want to silence the Genocide dictate your economic and aesthetic choice. You will not be sorry."
" Must watch for everyone!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Great storytelling, great acting! Fantastic accuracy of genocide's historic facts. I was really impressed by the director's ability of making those unbearably brutal and inhumane events so bearable, watchable and beneficial for wider audience. I think everyone needs to watch ""The Promise"" to become better informed, educated and prepared to face the dark side of the human history and be able to make this world a better place for future generations."
" 10/10 ! Phenomenal Movie, definitely recommended!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Very touching love story that included the rich history of Armenians and the Genocide that took place in 1915. Would recommend to anyone interested in learning more of the Armenian Genocide, or someone just looking to catch a great movie.I rate this a 10/10!"
" Sensitive, historically accurate, true story
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"This is a story that has waited over 100 years to be told. The story is accurate, sensitive and moving. A love story of a people group intertwined with a love story of a man who kept his promise. Well worth your time especially in today's political climate in Turkey. A truth that has been hidden is now in the light."
" finally the past is acknowledged
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Great movie and depicted the truth of the Armenian genocide in all its needed brutality It was historically accurate, devastating to watch but we all need to bear witness and finally admit what happened. The acting was stellar and the locations were beautifully shot. This movie should be shown at every elementary and high school. About time that this issue is brought to the forefront."
" Truth and Empathy
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I watched 'The Promise' opening weekend and was overwhelmed with sadness, hope and love about the depiction of the Armenian Genocide of 1915. The movie does a great job establishing the turbulent times and the immediacy of living, loving and surviving in such brutal conditions. I felt the love story created empathy for the Armenian characters and people as a whole.It's a powerful film giving a great overview of the Armenian Genocide, which is still not globally recognized 102 years later. Far more grotesque brutalities we're carried out by the Ottoman Turks on Armenians not depicted in the film (mothers and fathers being raped, beheaded, starved in front of their children); however, moments in the film speak to such heinous acts.Watch and learn about this crucial time in human history. It is necessary to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide to help the modern world reach peace–look at today, oppressive government states and fleeing refugees are still in the news. The bullies got a way with an unjust act, but together we can make justice prevail by being educated with the truth."
" What a masterpiece!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"What a wonderful and emotional film! The acting was brilliantly played by Oscar Isaac, Charlotte Le Bon and Christian Bale. I hope Armenia finally gets the recognition they deserve. This move show how the Armenians will never give up in what they believe and love. You can place two Armenians in the world and they will re-create Armenia."
" The Promise - Educational, Moving and Timely
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Watched ""The Promise"" over the weekend and was made aware of a tragic historical event for which I had no previous understanding. The movie is well made, well acted and involves a story line that allows the educational ""medicine"" to be taken in by a wide ranging audience of ages, cultures and backgrounds. The movie's significance and message is also very timely and bearing a striking resemblance to world events happening right now.See it, be inspired, be awoken, become more understanding of this history. I did and I am."
" Well made, moving, and emotional.
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Great movie. I would also like it to be known that many of the ratings have been falsely put on IMDb by Turkish nationalists that don't want the movie to be seen as a success. You will find that the movie is ranked really high or really low, those low votes came from the 55,000 people who gave the movie 1 star and this is why overall, the movie only has 5.8 stars. Great educational movie and I recommend to everyone"
" My opinion of ""The Promise""
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I am still in awe after watching ""The Promise"" several days ago. It truly was an incredibly powerful film, which really moved me. I say this not only because I am Armenian, but because the movie was very beautifully executed and told the story of such an important topic, such as the Armenian Genocide, in a tasteful manner. The film was very well written, with thoughtful development of the characters who each played their role so well. Growing up, of course I knew and commemorated the Armenian Genocide each year on April 24, however, nothing truly moved me as much as this film did! I was overwhelmed by the amount of emotion I felt and experienced while watching this film, and while simultaneously being intrigued by its romance story, as well as the beautiful shots of scenery it demonstrated. ""The Promise"" is a must-see movie, one that has a story worth telling."
" A great introduction to the topic & complex love story
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"While the movie could've shown a bit more about the events leading to the Armenian Genocide / WW1 and only brushed upon the horrible events that took place — the love story was not contrived and misplaced as other reviewers have commented. It does a great job of explaining the complex relationships and fast decisions that occur in life & death situations. The performances are stellar — Oscar Isaac does a great job of conveying the emotions of his character's circumstances, and Christian Bale's character certainly conveys integrity and helps the theme of honoring the truth that has been covered up for over a century."
" Amazing Depiction of a Sad Time in History
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"This was an amazing story placed during the the Armenian Genocide when the Ottoman Empire, a.k.a. the Turks, killed 1.5 million of the 2 million Armenians in the area, then taking their homes and lands. It is a sad time in history which is still being hidden by the Turks. This movie portrays how many a life was effected and the atrocities committed. Everyone should see this movie! The sheer amount of emotion put into this subject shows what has been done to a great people! See this movie and support human rights!"
" A promise to survive
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie evokes all kinds of human emotions. You feel the characters struggle, pain and suffering. Isaac embodies his character to the fullest. His performance is nothing short of Oscar worthy. The historical facts are masterfully incorporated into a story of Michael, Anna, Maral and Chris. In this movie George honors the 1.5 million Armenian souls who were brutally murdered, by humanizing their existence. I highly recommend this movie."
" Epic Film! Don't listen to the negative comments!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"The Promise is an epic film based on historic events during the first part of World War I (between 1915-1922). The cinematography is amazing and the story itself, if your a normal human and not a barbarian, gets to your core, shakes you up and throws you back down. In order for the film to be used as an educational tool it captures a minimal amount of the actual violent acts committed by the Turks against the Armenian people in an attempt to eliminate the entire population.The negative reviews should be ignored as they are an attempt to yet again silence the truth about the Armenian Genocide. Read the Huffington Post review written by Mary Wald, she explains this all very well, and go see The Promise, it's a phenomenal movie!"
" The Best Movie I have ever watched!!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,This movie needs to be seen. So much spirit and information about the Armenian genocide. Do not look at the low reviews because those are false and not accurate.Go watch the movie and then rate it. The Armenian Genocide needs to be recognized and if people go and watch this movie they will learn more about the history of the Armenians and what had happened to the Armenians. Go watch this movie asap!!!!!
" MUST SEE - gripping, raw and real...
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Worth seeing in the theater for sure. Truly a great movie for serious moviegoers. It is rewarding to support courageous filmmaking. There were some scenes that could have been cut out but overall, truly gripping. It is one of those movies that inspires an immediate coffee (or cocktail) it can be discussed in detail and thoughts can be shared. Great casting and cinematography. Historically accurate. The writing was excellent."
" FANTASTIC MOVIE- Incredible depiction of true events that occurred during the Armenian Genocide
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,This film was absolutely incredible- the fantastic depiction of the Armenian spirit and sheer determination to survive while suffering systematic annihilation and deportation at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. The passion of each character to fight for what is right takes them on a long journey that we follow with our hearts pounding almost the entire time. Beautifully done.
" Well written true story of the Armenian Genocide
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"This film was more powerful and intense than I expected. It tells a lost story that more than half the world doesn't know. Its very thrilling and intense to see a whole race of people vanishing without much resistance. Terry George did a great job of telling the story of the Armenian Genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Turks. Actors hit a home run. It's the kind of movie, genre, you don't see much anymore and it was a treat getting to see it. This kind of travesty is happening today with the events of Syria, and will keep happening until the whole world knows what happened and what is happening. Bravo to the crew!!"
" А real diamond
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Great script and characters, brilliant actors. Very realistic film, as it is based on the real history of the Armenian Genocide in turkey. However, this is not a historical documentary about the massacre of 1.5 million Armenians and other Christians. This is just a tiny part of the huge picture of genocide. Forgotten Genocide!!!"
" Not only historical facts were there but also well delivered.
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Cast was excellent,the acting superb, and story line well delivered. I urge you to go and see the move for historical value, while enjoying a beautiful love story. Now perhaps the bones of 1.5 Million Armenians can be closer to resting in peace. They are not forgotten, their grandchildren are living another day to tell the story!"
" Powerful story about the Armenian Genocide
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,What a powerful love story which tells the untold truth about the Armenian Genocide. This story has been buried in history it was so emotional to watch it being told on the screen. Beautiful Costume and set design. Amazing Actors and actresses. Overall a A+ film! I will recommend it to family and friends!
" Truly great
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I mean, I'm still emotional as I saw this just last night...I couldn't even sleep at night... but to be short, it is definitely a movie worth watching! The emotion, the pain....the injustice! An eye-opener for sure... And the fact, that the events of 1915 (ish) are STILL not recognized by the Turkey and most of the world boggles my mind!..."
" Everyone should see this
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,9,"professional actors, great story, wonderful scenery. People may shy away from seeing this movie because they think it might be depressing. It is a love story taking place as the Genocide of the Armenian people unfolds in Constantinople and villages in Eastern Turkey. The Turkish government and their lobbyists could not suppress the facts that this movie clearly shows: that they planned the extermination of the Armenians from their lands. A must see for adults and students studying human rights, history, genocide, refugees, civil war and terrorism."
" Entertaining and Educational
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,9,"I was overwhelmed knowing that this is a story about my family and their survival of the Armenian Genocide. I am glad the story is finally being told to the masses. See this movie not just for entertainment purposes, but for educational purposes as well! The love story is fine, but the historical significance is the most important part of the movie."
" The story of one survivor
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie over the weekend and i'm honestly very confused and saddened by the harsh reviews. If the movie cut out the little bit of ""romance"" and added only blood and killings (like the genocide was) it would have turned into a documentary and not the story of ONE persons life during this time. The movie was tastefully made to shed light on a horrible time but still made it easy to watch for those who have not heard of the Armenian genocide. When you listen, they spoke facts throughout the movie. It is strong and touching but done in a way that it can be shown in schools to educate the youth. Everyone in the theater was in tears. Very emotional. I recommend everyone give it a chance... you will not regret it."
" An Amazing, Real Life Film
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I was able to see a screening of this movie last weekend, and I assumed this would be another tired love story, but I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie is an incredible piece of work that looks like so much time and effort was put into.Based on real life events from WWI, this movie takes you back to a time where Armenians struggled and this film really depicts that.Fast moving film, very thought provoking and the historical aspect of it is very informative.Great film, as a Turk- I recommend everyone to watch and learn what really happened 100 years ago."
" Must See!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,I can't express how happy and thankful I am that this movie was created for the Armenian people. There is so much to learn from this movie and from the history of this event that has been downplayed for so long. Only deniers would give this movie low reviews. This is a must see and a beautiful movie! So hauntingly relevant to what is going on today. We must all learn from these crimes!
" Very Moving Story about the Turkish Massacre of the Armenians
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,9,"I saw this movie because I am a history buff. I knew about the Armenian Genocide from a course I took in college. I thought the movie was a well done and moving portrayal of events. Cinematography was beautiful. The story line was simple and uncomplicated. I was immersed in the movie from the start to the finish. I plan to see it again next week.I gave it a ""9"" because it did not provide enough background on the horrible and heinous crimes and treatment the Armenians received by the Turkish government - I thought they ""tip-toed"" over the fact that one and a half million Armenians were ruthlessly slaughtered by the Turks.George Maxwell"
" Amazingly accurate and powerful film everyone must see.
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Very inspirational, extremely accurate film about the Armenian Genocide. The story line was very easy to follow and was very emotional and suspenseful. Everyone sitting around me in the theater were crying and it had a strong emotional impact on even non Armenians. Wasn't too gory, it had just enough violence to portray the aggressiveness of the Genocide and was appropriate for mature children. This movie had a very powerful meaning and anyone curious about the genocide or the Armenian people should see this accurate film... it will answer many questions. There are many people trying to show hate towards this movie because they don't want the public knowing the truth about what the Turks did to the Armenians. The truth needs to be told and heard... this movie is the way!"
" Great film!!!!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I saw this and thought it was a wonderful movie. The acting was stellar. I never knew about the Armenian genocide & this film enlightened me about this terrible tragedy. Wish I/we had learned about this in school. Do yourself a favor & watch this film, you won't be disappointed."
" Amazing Movie!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I was spellbound from the first scenes. Hearing my grandfather's name, Mikael, seeing the beautiful village of Siroune and so much more. The historical authenticity of the film is outstanding. I heard the stories first-hand as a child as I sat with survivors, lived with a survivor of the genocide, and witnessed the physical and emotional wounds of these friends and families - and, most of all, my father. He lost his wife, children and all family members in a village of Moush. His sister, who had left a year earlier with her husband, was in Canada and he reunited. Eventually made his way to southern Virginia where he reconnected with a family member, who was only a child during the genocide. She was saved by Catholic nuns and spirited out of Turkey to America. I remember an elderly lady in the St. Catherines community in Canada who placed my tiny hand at the time into the wound of her arm where flesh had been cut out by a soldier. She said, ""Remember! One day they will say this never happened."" I REMEMBER AND I STAND TALL FOR I AM A PROUD ARMENIAN!"
" Really Good Film
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie yesterday, 4/23/17, and was moved to tears near the end. The story's premise is a well known historical fact (not the fictional love story) and was sensitively depicted, though sanitizing the actual depravity and brutality of the Turks. If only the Turks would admit their history as the Germans did after WWII, much of the bitterness would ease. But the current generation of Turks have not been taught this stain on their national character, so I understand their reluctance to believe it. However, one cannot erase history.The audience actually clapped at the end and I cannot remember the last time I saw that happen in a movie theater. So apparently, it was effective and well received by those who actually saw the film."
" Great Movie!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie was a Great movie! Have I seen better movies about genocides and historical events? Yes, but was this a great movie? Also yes.Due to personal tastes, people may like certain aspects more than others, but overall it does credit to a small story within the larger Armenian Genocide.The Genocide deniers are despicable human beings for tarnishing a valid, and well done historically accurate film, and it just goes to show that the Turkish govt. (A failure of democracy and modern ideals)is no different than the current Syrian Government.This movie is worth watching. To EVERYONE who wants to deny one historical genocide or another, be it the Armenian Genocide, The holocaust, Mao's ""Great Leap forward"", or the Rwandan genocide. You are scum, and your disgusting evil will be called out anywhere and everywhere."
" Excellent
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"10/10 I highly recommend. From the director who brought you ""Hotel Rwanda,"" and a cast of some of the best actors of our generation, comes a beautifully moving story based on the Armenian Genocide. An excellent movie with beautiful cinematography, incredible acting, and a beautiful script."
" Amazing movie for history lovers
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"A valuable and unbiased piece of history, which unfortunately is being hidden by so called ""Democracy creating"" countries. A full 2 hour of heartbreaking time. It delivers the real face of Ottoman empire and Turkish politics to the audience, which you won't usually learn from the mainstream media."
" The Promise is an excellent film...it's about time we have an historically accurate film about the Armenian Genocide.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"As an Armenian American, I learned about the Armenian genocide from my extended family, friends and historical research. This film, The Promise, recounts the actual history of the Armenian Genocide, in particular the story of the French ships saving 4,000 Armenian people from the mountains of Musa Dagh who were being hunted down by the Turkish military. The Turkish government has attempted to deny and cover up the atrocities committed against its ethnic Armenian, Assyrian and Greek citizens, but the truth is coming out. This film was independently financed by Kirk Kerkorian who did not live long enough to see the film through its full fruition. In the past, the 40 Days of Musa Dagh story was attempted to be told in film, but was censored by the Turkish government via the US State Dept. So finally we have a film that tells the story, with historical accuracy about the atrocities committed by the Ottoman Young Turks government which resulted in an genocide of over 1.5 Armenian men, women and children."
" Most moving film of the year.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,9,"I feel that most critics are being a little too ""critical"" with their reviews of this film, and I'm failing to see why. This was honestly one of the most moving films I've seen in a very long time. A must see for anyone who is a fan of strong plots and emotional stories. A lot of critics are saying that this film focuses too much on the love story, but it is really so much more than that. It explores a man's journey through love, loss, and struggle. Fantastic film."
" The Promise
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Great movie that was historically accurate and kept you interested through two hours. Without giving away spoilers, the movie took you back in time and gives a glimpse of an untold horror of Armenians and other minorities in Turkey. Finally a movie that is griping and educational about the genocide"
" Powerful, touching, absolutely the best!
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I forgot when was the last time I saw such a powerful movie.Thought they don't do them any more. What a surprise! Everything was great, acting, story line, astonishing truth to be finally revealed & learned. It reveals one of the most shameful moments in the human history.Every person should see it."
" The Promise
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"The movie was beautifully done! The acting, directing, and the casting. As an Armenian, I am grateful that such a beautiful movie was finally made to tell the world about Armenian Genocide. I think Oscar Isaac acting was fantastic and he deserves an Oscar for his role. Also Christian Bale was phenomenal. Thanks to Chris Myers ""reporting"" that there are photographs of Genocide published. Also would like to add that Charlotte La Bone, Angela Sarafyan, and Shohreh Agdashloo are amazing actresses and their performance in this movie were phenomenal. Thank you! Also a big thank you to late Mr. Kirk Kerkorian for making this happen for the Armenian people. It is sad that Mr. Kerkorian is not with us to see his production."
" Gutwrenching, infuriating, and satisfying
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This is a well told story that will take your emotions on a deep journey. You may have heard these stories from survivors, grandparents, or teachers. You may have learned about the genocide from history, museums, and churches. But to see a part of the story on screen in Hollywood style brings some sense of justice, as if to say, the truth has been finally revealed."
" Excellent movie that will captivate the core of your humanity
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,Very inspirational and powerful depiction of the horrific war crimes suffered by the Christian minority at the hands of the Ottoman Empire at the start of WWI. The actors did a fantastic job capturing the audience with the atrocities that people endured at the time without the need for gory details. As a viewer your soul is troubled by the suffering that people went through at the time in such a manner that you will walk out of the theater so inspired to keep the promise against the number of genocides occurring in similar parts of the world today.
" Well-made, moving film
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't originally planning to go see this movie, but my roommate told me he was going and after watching the trailer I thought I'd give it a shot. And I'm glad I did. While this isn't a perfect film (the opening feels a little rushed, for example), the qualities of this film far outweigh any flaws in it. It's well-acted, beautifully shot, has a haunting score, and quite emotional. Seriously, you would have to have a heart of stone to not be moved at all by this movie.I won't go into much detail because I don't want to detract from the experience of watching this movie for the first time, but I must say that the surprising standout is not Oscar Isaac or Christian Bale (although they are both great in this movie), but rather Charlotte Le Bon, who is the leading lady in this film. Her performance just immediately endears you to her character. She is just so great in this movie. Could not do a review of this movie without giving her a shout-out.Finally, don't pay attention to the negative opinions on this movie. Most of them are coming from people over in Turkey who didn't even want this film to be made in the first place, so they are automatically biased. This is a well-made film, with great performances and a lot of heart. And to top it all off, every cent spent on this film at the box office goes to charity. So go see this movie. You'll get a great experience, and you'll be helping some folks out while you're at it."
" Incredible Film... Oscar Worthy
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This film left me speechless. Not only was it a wonderfully produced and directed film, it shed light on one of the most important events of the 20th century, the ""forgotten"" genocide; the Armenian Genocide. The movie did an amazing job capturing the horrific atrocities that were committed by the Ottoman Turks in 1915. The acting in this film was outstanding, and it was obvious that the actors took their role to heart. I've heard so much nonsense about the false bad reviews in attempt to make this film fail... let me tell you, boy are they false! The Promise exceeded all of my expectations. I highly highly recommend this movie for EVERYONE!!!"
" An amazing film!!!
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Not only a great love story, but also historically accurate. Some of the events shown on screen were painful to watch, but did unfortunately occur in real life. It is a must see for all those who appreciate history and are eager to learn more. Educate yourselves and see The Promise!"
" Moving film about the shocking genocide of Armenians in Turkey
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I had read many books and historical information about the Armenian genocide and how Hitler was so sure that no one would come to the aid of the Jewish people because the world ignored the Turkish genocide of Armenians in World War 1.You will watch how the genocide starts in Turkey and understand how similar was in Germany years later under Hitler. It starts with little things and then mass killings and taking of homes, belongings and property. People are marched into the desert, taken for slave labor and no one stops it. Even the Armenian people at first think that ""this too will pass"".But this movie does not show the harshest of the atrocities. It even shows a three way love story that while heartrending adds some softness and love to the Armenian story line. The background scenery is beautiful and all the main characters are excellent in their depiction in Armenian mores of this time period."
" a must see
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"My heart will always be in Malta and ""The Promise"" reinvents this picturesque landscape as Constantinople circa 1915. It serves as an astounding backdrop for the development of characters during this trying time for Armenians within the Ottoman Empire. The intensity and passion of the love triangle takes second fiddle to the reprehensible nature of the Turkish barbarism and leaves the audience awaiting Michael's next move. He rises to the occasion as our champion of resiliency and we live through his eyes as he permeates through the variant killing spheres that sadly is the Armenian Genocide. This film is a masterpiece that comes along once a generation. It cogently humanizes the reality of the Armenian Genocide and succinctly permits us to touch and feel the tragedy that is so much more than the political chess piece it has become. Highly recommended!"
" The Promise move was made for all kinds of audience in mind.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Move taking place in historic Armenia illustrates Christian Armenians life achievements there. You can tell, Very peaceful and not hateful towards Turkish, by watching the move. Nonetheless, Turkish officials and general population were somehow hateful of Armenias, Exception of very few! Perhaps they were Christian or they were successful and eager to succeed? May be both!I love how powerful romance also sends a message of love for nation and religion.All in all I loved the move and grading it 10!"
" I loved it. Very well done.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Bravo to Terry George for directing this film so brilliantly. It is obvious that extensive research was done. It is historically accurate . I am delighted that the truth about the Armenian genocide is being exposed to a wider audience. Turkey must come to terms with its past and stop its denial of the brutal slaughter of a million.and a half Armenian people. My parents'families were victims of that genocide, and I would like to see the truth acknowledged and Armenia and Turkey to live as friendly neighbors . The truth shall prevail."
" Amazing, meaningful movie that everyone should watch
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie was amazing I recommend everyone to go watch it. This movie truly illustrates what the Armenian people have went through, and yet there are still people out there that deny the Armenian genocide. After watching this movie I hope everyone will understand what a cruel past the Armenian people have went through. Genocide never again, 1915 never again."
" story about a love triangle who endures the terrible acts of the Armenian genocide.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,Fantastic movie and portrayed the events and atrocities committed by the ottoman empire extremely well. It reminded me of the stories my grandparents told me about their parents as well as their grandparents. Great movie to watch and hopefully a step in getting the killings of 1915 recognized as a genocide.
" Amazing
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,Very happy to see a true and tragic part of history become known to many. This movie was amazing and depicted all of the hardships that Armenians really went through over 100 years ago. The characters did an amazing job portraying the pain that Armenians faced..as loved ones were brutally murdered.
" A must watch for all!
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"""The Promise"" is a monumental motion picture. It is on point with it's historical accuracy making it noteworthy to watch. The love story incorporated in the plot helps viewers understand and follow the sequence of events in a significant manner. This movie was profoundly produced with the most talented individuals in the film industry. It was one of the most enriching Hollywood experiences I have ever had."
" Major and factual aspects of horrific historical event successfully covered in two hour movie
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,9,"Honing in on exterminating the minority population, taking the intellects and priests first, death marches through the Syrian desert, slavery, brutal murders (hangings, cutting unborn babies out of the womb, and more so unimaginable), love lost, families torn apart with only fragments remaining clinging to one another for survival, rebuilding successful but heartbroken lives in a new country... it was all incorporated in a very tasteful yet emotional and educational way. Beautiful settings; powerful scenes. Oscar Isaac deserves an Oscar. A must see."
" A very powerful film!
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,Director George gives us another masterpiece! The brilliant cast and writers powerfully reveal the facts about the Armenian Genocide and show the extraordinary suffering of countless innocent people under the brutal Ottoman regime. This is a very powerful movie and has a great educational value.
" The truth is finally coming out
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,This was a fantastic movie. These are the story's that my great grandparents went through to make it out alive. This movie really hit home.. great movie must watch.. not sure why in this day in age you still have Turkish people still saying this never happen.. the truth will always come out... if it's not now it will be later.. thank you for the cast and crew that spent time on the movie.. BTW.. where here to stay.. you just made the Armenians stronger..
" Beautiful. 1915 Never Again
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"this movie was so beautifully written and portrayed the true history of what occurred in 1915 between Armenian and the Turks. What truly gives weigh and more meaning to this film is the fact that until today Turkey denies the Armenian Genocide and that is such a shame given the amount of attention from countries and celebrities that support this piece of history that gave way to other similar atrocities such as Rwanda, and the holocaust."
" Excellent !! Must see.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I recommend this movie to everyone, it is a very action packed love story with lots of historically true settings, The promise is definitely a promising movie to watch with everything a movie expert would want in a movie, overall I would say this is a 10 star movie! It provides a clear explanation of the Armenian genocide while including an amazing love story plot. Overall this is one of the best movies I have ever watched and look forward to watching it when comes on TV again with my husband and son."
" I loved this movie
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,9,"I voted 9 because 10 means absolute perfect rating. I gave 9, because there is tremendous integrity and honesty in depicting a complex crime that baffled even the Armenian citizens of the Ottoman Empire at the time. By the time Armenians realized what was happening it was too late. The director manages to transmit this notion to the audience perfectly.In spite of all the dissing by professional reviewers that a story of a ""love triangle"" does not fit in a movie depicting such a crime as the Armenian genocide, and that the love affair is not convincing, etc... I thought A) it made perfect sense that these characters could fall in love B) it was quite fitting and logical with the story line and quite well done, actually. The history of the mistreatment of the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire is a multilayered and complex issue not easily tackled, the genocide did not happen ""overnight"", the pogroms and persecution started in mid-1880's, culminating in a ""final solution"" in 1915. How does a filmmaker address this to an audience who might not even know where Armenia is? This is where the common thread of a ""love story"" for all audiences works beautifully in telling such a dark and unknown story.I gave 9, because I thought it is an excellent film, and Oscar Isaac's performance is Outstanding and Oscar worthy...pardon the pun. Go see it and you'll agree with me, I'm sure."
" Great movie, good acting, highly recommend
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,9,"If you watch the trailer and understand the movie is about the Armenian Genocide and there is a love story, in my opinion, to attract more people to the film than might go if it stuck to a more ""documentary"" style movie strictly about the Armenian Genocide, than you will find it is a great movie. I have read complaints from critics about having a ""love story"" diminishing the atrocities of the genocide but disagree. I think it showed the real pain of love, death and loss of loved ones. I think Oscar Isaac did a great job acting in the lead role as well as Charlotte Le Bon as the leading lady. Christian Bale was excellent as well. It was a very serious, sad movie about the systematic extinction of every Armenian man, women and child by the Turkish government under the guise of ""relocation"". The ""relocation"" started by taking the smart, wealthy Armenian leaders and ""relocating"" them to prisons and executing them. The next ""relocation"" was death marches into the desert without food or water and murdering innocent people. ""Relocating"" villages to ditches and murdering everyone. I think it was well written and had a good flow and structure to the movie which was easily followed and understood. I like that is showed the journey of the young, enthusiastic Mikael going to medical school full of promise, hopes and dreams of a good life, through the horrors he endured and ultimately to a flash forward to him years later. Very powerful movie which I highly recommend as do 92% of Google users."
" Beautifully done
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Wow, what a beautifully done film which finally tells the truth. Chrisitan Bale did an excellent job portraying the news reporter. The story of Musa Dagh was depicted accurately. The story is difficult one to tell, but was done very well. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone. It was certainly a difficult movie to watch."
" A must see
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"A must see. The movie is a love story which takes place during the Armenian genocide. The costumes, imagery, and landscapes transport the viewer to another era. From an opulent family mansion in Constantinople to rural villages in the heartland, each scene is drawn like a painting. The captivating story carries you through horrible genocide scenes, which are shot with great mastery. For a few seconds, Ambassador Henry Morgenthau and Rev. Komitas will come to life. it's History that unfolds in front of your eyes. iI made me dream and cry."
" The Promise focused a little too much on the love story and less on the tragedy.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,5,"When it comes to films with a tragedy event, it feels like it would always be a better idea to throw in a love triangle to help create a more dramatic experience. The Promise does that and failed, this time going during the Ottoman Empire and the genocide atrocity that many Armenian people were being murdered. It is a story that not many historical films went over. The film has an okay story, talented actors playing dull characters, and a direction that thinks a love triangle would be perfect for a mass tragedy war. The plot follows Mikael (Oscar Isaac), who lives in an Armenian village with his family. Studying to go to medical school and promised to be married to a family friend and in return his medical lessons are paid for. Once arriving in Turkey, he stays with his wealthy uncle, where he meets an Armenian woman Ana (Charlotte Le Bon). She was raised in Paris and with a journalist Chris (Christian Bale). Their relationship has not been perfect, when Chris is committed to his work and trying to be a heroic in exposing the truth about the war. Mikael falls in love with Ana, right before when World War I begins. Mikael tries to exempt himself from being enlisted to the military by stating that he is a medical student. When a round up, ends with him being caught and taken to a labor camp on building a railroad. Meanwhile, Ana and Chris are reaching across to help a group of orphans taking refuge in a missionary retreat to try to get out of the country. Especially, when Chris witnessed as the Ottoman army are taking the Armenian people and ""relocating"" them to a different area. Only to see that they are being executed. The plot was decent, and yes it is one of those historical films that go over the Armenian genocide. Which is something that is never seen before in historical films during the World War I. Sadly, the film also fails when they try to add a love triangle with Mikael already being promised to another for marriage but falls in love with Ana. Who is already in a relationship with Chris and their struggle of a relationship. Which she is frustrated for his rude drunk behavior at parties. We can all tell with the predictableness on how this all plays out. It really feels like they force this subplot of a love story in a tragedy event. Sure, other films work it out better like Titanic, Pearl Harbor, etc. Christian Bale is a great actor and Oscar Isaacs as well. Charlotte Le Bon is a beautiful stunning actress. There characters are forgettable. The direction is also dull and boring. Could have been better if they had a better music score to build the emotional tension. The most emotional tension we get from the movie is when Mikael notices the Armenian people he once knew, murdered in the forest. And that silent moment on screen was a powerful emotional scene. Overall, The Promise is a historical drama film that missed its mark on being a masterpiece when it falls under its love triangle clichés, dull written characters, and a boring direction."
" Finally, a film that tells the story...
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Many people are unaware of the Armenian Genocide, an atrocity that occurred from 1914-17. My dear grandparents and their families, went through unimaginable sufferings; they were approx 8 years old when their homes were burned, their parents killed and they were forced to flee. I have detailed personal interviews and accounts of their stories.Over the years this atrocity received little press, for political reasons. FINALLY we have a film, now in theaters, that tells the story. And it tells the story WELL."
" Must see, absolutely phenomenal
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"When a movie stays with you hours after you leave, and you realize you can't stop talking about it or thinking about it, that's when you realize just how good it is and that you need to create an IMDb account and write a review. This movie far exceeded all my expectations, from the writing to the directing, I don't even know where to begin. So all I'll say is GO SEE IT and you will see for yourself. Let the Oscar nominations begin rolling in."
" A love story in the context of the first world war
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Incredible cast and directing. Phenomenal background music and film shooting. Unmasking Turkey's denial of the Armenian Genocide. A MUST TO SEE movie. A whole nation is destroyed and massacred in front of the allies. One woman, two lovers go through hell. One perishes and the 2 stay luckily alive .... and form the roots of the survival of Armenians."
" Excellent film!
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,I've seen this film twice this weekend and am still blown away by the fact that a film about the Armenian Genocide has actually made it to the big screen all across the US. Friends who know little about the Armenian Genocide have had a chance to learn more. Those of us familiar with Armenian history and culture can find many subtle nuances in the film that add so many more layers of meaning to the film. An extraordinary story told magnificently well. It is a high quality film with a terrific cast of actors. Everyone with whom I saw the film was grateful to have had a chance to see this terrific film on the big screen and to learn more about an ignored period of history.
" Excellent
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I thought the movie was excellent. Long movies are not my forte, but this one was so gripping that the time just flew by. Bring a hankie. The history intertwined with the love story is an ideal way to show the atrocities of that genocide. Historical movies are usually boring to me, but this one had just enough history to make it real and dramatic. I highly recommend it."
" A must see
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"The historical accuracy of the atrocities are invaluable. Hitler said ""who after all speaks of the annihilation of the Armenians"" to justify his atrocities against the Jews. Although the love story is supposed to be the primary story, the depictions of genocide and inhumanity and the subsequent denial of the genocide is where this film shines. A must see."

",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,Kirk did an amazing job in finally financing a very important movie. I would see it again and encourage people of all cultures to see it. Turkey remains in denial of the Armenian genocide and it's important to put this film out there to show the true facts. The cast was amazing and did a fine job in portraying the expressions of those in the war.
" Bravo
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,I couldn't help but cry all through out this movie. Needless to say it was very touching and moving to see all that I've heard about the genocide of the Armenians. It was beautifully written and played out. Christian Bale did a phenomenal job as lead. I am proud to see directors take on such historical eras. This was truly an amazing look into life during the early 1914 and what occurs between two countries we're often not told about in history books.
" For All
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"No matter your race, religion nor ethnicity, The Promise is worth watching for the sake of understanding what humanity has endured and continues to endure in other parts of the world. It brings to the center of our attention the inhumane acts committed by the turks of the ottoman empire, who continue to ignore that such acts took place. I find it important for all to watch The Promise and to be aware of the history of other cultures."
" Classic Historical Drama That Avoids Sappiness
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"The Promise is epic, sweeping, beautiful, emotional, heartbreaking and eye opening - this is why we go to the movies! Yes, it has a love triangle, but it avoids the cheesiness and modern soap opera feel that so often befalls historical films that use that trope for human interest. All the actors are at the top of their game. The cinematography is gorgeous and the CGI establishing shots are believable. This is an Oscar worthy film. The Promise will do for The Armenian Genocide what Schindler's List did for The Holocaust. If you are a fan of films like Hotel Rwanda, Defiance, 12 Years A Slave or Flowers of War, you'll love The Promise."
" Excellent
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Exquisite direction, sublime acting, heavenly music, impeccable editing. Overall true and compelling story. What else can be said. This is the first movie depicting events of Armenian genocide. Every Armenian family has its own personal story like this. The. Story speaks to the hearts and minds of all human beings regardless of race and creed. This movie is definitely a piece of art and will stay in history of cinematography as such."
" An excellent movie!
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This was a very well done movie about a very difficult time in history that should not be repeated for any race or religion. It is not gratuitous. It is a simple telling a many true stories of what people experienced at a time in world history. This story is more than a love story. Given the current crisis in Syria and around the world, this is a warning that we must not repeat history. Is not the Genocide, the Holocaust, and atrocities in Rwanda enough? Watch the movie. The acting, cinematography, costumes, plot - everything is excellent."
" Mesmerizing and Truthful
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"The Promise spreads awareness to the wrongdoings of the Armenian people. It tells their story by depicting their losses, their agonies, and their woes. It eloquently details the ambition and courage of the Armenian people and their devotion to one another. Truthful and inspiring, this movie is one to see I've and over again. You will not be disappointed!"
" Excellent and Heartwrenchng and Haunting
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Truly hits home. I grew up listening to my grandmothers stories of growing up in an orphanage in Lebanon after watching her father die and her mother be taken away. She did not know what happened to her brother for years after they were separated. This movie is deeply personal while depicting a period of history that warrants global awareness and acknowledgment. Kudos and thanks to those dedicated to bringing the story to the world. Bring your family, friends, colleagues. You will be better for it."
" A pic without the E
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I gave it a 10 not because it deserved it but just to spite the Turkish attempt to deny their own genocidal history in the ratings game. The movie itself is an average one that does the subject up nicely for public consumption but keeps away from any attempt to go deep. Many dozens of movies have been made about the Holocaust and precious few about the Armenian genocide. This one will tick off the Turks, but given the direction Erdogan is taking them (with their helP) who Shives a git! Perhaps it's biggest victory will be if it becomes popular and educates."
" Epic Blockbuster
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie was well-written and superbly acted. Christian Bale--an amazing actor--continued to outdo himself as the American journalist reporting on the horrible atrocities to which he was a witness. Oscar Isaac brought raw emotion to the Armenian medical student, who witnesses the grotesque massacre of his loved ones during the Armenian Genocide, all the while struggling with his own emotions and new-found love. Charlotte Le Bron was a delight and provided an impressive third to the love-triangle. I congratulate Terry George for his directing and courage to take on such a difficult topic and make it palatable for for mass-market viewing. He was able to bring to light the heavy topic of the Armenian Genocide for educational purposes, while still making the movie watchable to those who did not have an inherent interest in the topic. Critics who were unable to comprehend this, of course, have provided negative reviews, which should be taken with a grain of salt. Unfortunately, the negative propaganda war against this film (and those prior to it) may ultimately impact the box-office returns--however, that was never the goal of this release. Those who were impacted by the Armenian Genocide, applaud the cast and crew and production behind bringing this story to the screen and look forward to the upcoming documentary!"
" Amazing, Must see!
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This film is powerful, wonderful acting, very well done! hits so many themes and is so moving and kept me engaged the whole time. It does a great job of shedding light to this time in history and has a great story line and actors. it was both very entertaining and emotional to watch. Would 100% recommend. Bravo to the director and producer, truly an amazing piece of work! Thank you Kirk Krikorian! It opened up awareness to the Armenian genocide!"
" A Must See for everyone.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Not a dry eye in the house. A packed theater with over 400 seats filled. Brilliant performances.The truth is finally being told. A true story of the persecution that the Armenians went though at the hands of the Turks. The only things it is missing is more of the history. Past and current maps of Armenia and the region in the beginning and end of the film would be helpful to those unfamiliar. More of the Armenian language, and culture would have been nice to see. But overall, definitely a must see. Will definitely be seeing it again!"
" Great movie. Over 2 hours and not a single minute of boredom.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Great movie. Over 2 hours and not a single minute of boredom. I checked the facts and they are indeed properly documented: Ottoman Empire pulled into WWI by the Germans to leverage Muslim populations against France and UK, Battleships Breslau and Goeben given as gifts, Berlin-Baghdad Railroad construction by Armenian slaves, etc. The movie covers historic details with great rigor.On the flip side, it attempts to cram too many facts and too many stories into a single stream. The storyboard is unevenly complex. It does not follow a classical hollywoodian rhythm and thus seems a bit uncomfortable (hollywoodian movies follow a certain pattern for a reason: they are cognitively easier to grasp)."
" BEST MOVIE ""The Promise""
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This is the best Armenian movie on the genocide that has been made up to now. It has been sold out in some of the theaters on this first weekend. My wife could not hold herself and started crying near the end. But the non-Armenian friends we took were crying too!!! She remembered the stories her grandmother told her of how they raped women and tied her brother up and dragged him through the streets with a horse until he died. Some of the things that I liked about the movie were: a) They rose above the vengefulness/retaliation issue by showing a Turk helping an Armenian and an American. Not all Turks or people of any nationality are bad. I do not want the world to think that the Armenians are after revenge. We are very forgiving and helpful people. b) I liked how Ana responded back to Michael when in anger he said that he wanted revenge after all the members of his family were slaughtered by the Turks: ""Our revenge will be to survive"" This further reinforces that we just want recognition that the genocide occurred (so that future genocides will not be attempted on other nationalities/races of people.) c) I thought they showed the impact of the killings on the survivors very well. The orphans left behind were devastating to watch. d) I liked Michael's comment to Chris reporting on the killings and then being able to go back to a comfortable life. The Armenians who survived lost family members and could not go back to any form of normalcy. They all had to start from scratch in a new country. This may encourage others (who live in a safe country and are not involved in ethnic cleansing) to get involved and help the victims in other countries. e) I did not think the love triangle was a cheesy addition. I do not think the public is willing to watch two hours of senseless killings and brutality. They needed to implement a relief so we could all take a breath and it also added to the plot. f) I appreciate that they gave credit and showed our gratitude to the French Navy and for the rescues and US Ambassador Henry Morgenthau for bringing to light the fact that it was NOT a war but a massacre. g) I loved the quotes at the end of the movie from William Saroyan and others. h) All in all, I think the movie's director, Terry George, fulfilled his commitment to make a movie that can be shown to teenagers in high school and added to the curriculum of history classes. What were your thoughts?"
" Exceeded my expectations
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful cinematography, outstanding acting, factually faithful and emotionally charged. Oscar Isaac did a fabulous job! Having read and heard of so many different accounts of the genocide growing up, I feel that the movie did a great job capturing bits and pieces of many of these stories, like a patchwork, to give viewers a better overall understanding of how the genocide was orchestrated and how slim chances of survival really were. At times, reminded me of Dr Zivango and the Titanic. Love that the proceeds from ticket sales are donated to charity. Bravo and thank you."
" Armenian Genocide
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,This is the best movie I have ever seen. Explains what the Turks really did to the Armenian population. Its time for them to own up for what they did. It's very sad and disappointing to watch but it's what really happened. I hate how all of our enemies are writing these low ratings when they haven't even watched it. They are just scared that the whole world is going to know what really happened. 1915 never again! Please go watch and support.
" The Promise Delivers A Dramatic And Historical Punch
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I am an Armenian-American but even discounting my ethnicity, this was a truly outstanding film on several levels. The Promise tells the important true story of the Armenian Genocide, which surprisingly few Americans know about. Outside of the Kardashian clan, Armenia and Armenians are foreign concepts to most Americans. This dramatic and tragic love story, set during the World War I period of 1915-1918, expresses without embellishment the horrors of the Armenian Genocide, which was the precursor to the Jewish Holocaust twenty-five years later: Hitler is famously quoted as having said ""Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?"" as an attempted justification for the travesty he committed.Dramatically, the movie is a love triangle story involving Michael (Oscar Issac), an aspiring doctor leaving his rural Armenian- populated Southern Turkey town to study medicine in the diverse and cosmopolitan Constantinople, the bridge between Europe and Asia. Michael enters into an arranged marriage with a young woman (Angela Sarafyan) from his hometown prior to his studies and uses the dowry to pay his medical school expenses. In Constantinople, through a family friend, Michael meets Ana Assyrian (Charlotte Le Bon), a fashionable Armenian who lived in Paris, and Chris Myers (Christian Bale), an American Associated Press journalist who attempts to send accounts back to New York of the graphic violence he has witnessed being perpetrated against Armenian citizens. As the two men are both romantically enraptured by the lovely Ana, the horrific events of the genocide unfold. German influence is carefully depicted and a growing nationalist bias is seen to take hold of Turks against any minority citizens living in Turkey, primarily Armenians. The performances by Bale, Le Bon, and Issac are engaging, and Bale is particularly convincing as the objective American horrified by what he has seen and determined to not allow the secret to be trapped within Turkeys's borders.The Promise is a cautionary historical tale about allowing unfettered and unchecked nationalistic fervor to grip a country which is amidst a depression and having its military, under the fog of war, to perpetrate unimaginable and unprecedented atrocities against men, women, and children simply trying to live in their hometowns based solely on their nationality. Not unlike events throughout the course of history, including perhaps events occurring elsewhere in the Middle East today, The Promise is a relevant movie that all Americans can learn from and intellectually apply to evaluations of current events today, to seek to protect the innocent and defenseless when necessary. Most importantly, the movie is the first wide-screen feature cinematic presentation of these historical events, despite the myriad of movies rightfully depicting the horrors of the subsequent Jewish holocaust. The Armenian Genocide, committed with calculated efficiency and cold organization by the Turkish military, gave Hitler a workable blueprint to commit his even worse mass extermination a generation later.In the court of public opinion, the Turkish Armenian Genocide- deniers and their pro-Turkey propaganda might be further quelled against the overwhelming evidence presented, and this film goes a long way in accomplishing that goal. Moreover, the movie could hopefully spur the long delayed American governmental formal recognition of this horrific event, whatever the political costs."
" in compliance with history
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This is by the far, the most impressive historical film about the Armenian Genocide. I really think that a majority of the scenes, the portrayal of the characters, was filmed completely in compliance with historically and archaeologically corroborated facts. I think that the more people see, regardless of ethnicity, political view, or religion, the more we raise awareness of the most turbulent moment in the history of Armenians, and perhaps Greeks, and Assyrians, as they suffered at the hands of the Ottoman Empire in the Armenian Genocide. This way we can counteract the Turkish government's vehement denial of this tragedy."
" Remembering my father and mother
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Remembering my father and mother who were kids at the time and their innocent parents who perished during the genocide Excellent film, first of its kind actually discussing the Armenian Genocide 10/10 Author: Jart from Los Angeles 19 March 2017 *** This review may contain spoilers ***Excellent film. It has all elements of a love story that is time after time faces roadblocks and bloodshed created by the racist Turkish regime. To put it simple, qassabs slaughtering innocent people while having no heart at all."
" Excellent Movie about Shamefully Unknown Atrocities
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,It is unfortunate that we have to learn about the Armenian genocide at the hands of the Turks over 100 years after it tragically occurred. Politics and a strong strategically located Turkey has prevented this story's dissemination and acknowledgment. A very well crafted movie that will hopefully be a big success!
" The Promise. Excellent movie about love and tragedy
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Excellent movie about love and tragedy in the midst of the Armenian Genocide during the last crumbling years of the Ottoman Empire with the emergence of WWI. Must see for history buffs. The movie depicts the grandeur of the Ottoman Empire in its last days, and their attempt to eliminate its Armenian population under the pretext of relocation during the war. It also tells the story of a diligent AP reporter discovering the horrible murders, and reporting the atrocities to the press."
" Political tampering
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,8,"All readers of the IMDb page for ""The Promise"" should be informed as many as 90,000 Turks have posted purely political, one-star ratings for this film since its first film festival showing. If possible, this should be rectified by IMDb. In other words, the present rating is political not theatrical - it is bogus."
" A must see!
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I am Armenian. Most of my family died in the Armenian Genocide. The few who did survive, fought with everything they had and because of that I am alive today. This movie did an amazing job giving people a feel of what happened to my culture. I held my mom's hand through the whole movie and it was very emotional for us. I am so grateful that this story is finally being told. Please go see this movie!"
" Great Movie to watch and learn history
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Truth should be heard about Ottoman empire doings of the 1915 killings of Armenians. which most of the world still don't know.. And still being denied and ignored. It is not right for things like this to get ignored, because it still will happen, and people to get away with it...A must see movie..."
" Beautiful and real depiction of a horrid time in history, a must-see
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This story encompassed such important and significant figures in the Armenian genocide and how against all odds, some Armenians, missionaries, journalists, officials from other governments survived to tell the tale of the atrocities committed against the Armenian, Greek and Assyrian minorities in the Ottoman Empire and neighboring Armenia. Acting by all, but particularly by Oscar Isaac, was phenomenal. Costume, music and cinematography was very realistic and beautifully used. Terry George has done it again, reminding us of our darkest moments as a human race so that we do not commit such acts again."
" Oscar worthy performances and cinematography
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This was an epic movie with Oscarworthy performances by Oscar Isaac, Charlotte Le Bon and Christian Bale. A love triangle woven in to the tragic tapestry of the Armenian genocide. Director Terry George tells the story with sensitivity, cinematic artistry and supreme regard for the historic facts. This movie has the makings of a classic. Go see it!"
" Must Watch
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Movie itself was Very good and MUST watch, but it was not enough to show the full scale of war crimes of Government of then Ottoman Empire (now Turkey) known as the Armenian Genocide. The subject of the Armenian Genocide is a different historic event and for that needs more detailed films based on true events, Documentaries and series of films on witness accounts, not one, but many.In this film the Director Terry George and the film Studio is trying to show many different stories based on Historic evidences like Henry Morgentau Sr. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morgenthau_Sr.) portrayed by James Cromwell, the book of Franz Werfel's ""40 Days of Musa Dag"" (https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007049) and many eye witnesses of the Armenian Genocide. In my opinion, the film succeeded as an entertainment and actors did an amazing work to show their craft! To make a film based on historic events of 102 years ago is hard and this film did what it was possible, under the pressure of foreign (in this case Turkish) government's heavy lobby against such films. Kudos to Producers, the Director, the film crew and actors who made a bold stance against foreign influence and stood up for what is right and made this film! I would love to mention the actors, Oscar Isaac, Christian Bale, Chrlotte Le Bon, James Cromwell, Marwan Kenzari, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Angela Sarafyan, Rade Serbedzija and least not last Stewart Scudamore, they did great job and leave audience in tears, to seek more of the history facts and get to learn about this part of the Humanity dark historic past! Chris Cornell's music touches the heart and soul of audience at the end, you can listen it here: https://youtu.be/WPiJ79Ure1I Definitely an Oscar worthy Film, Music and Acting!"
" Deserve an Oscar
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I don't believe the rating of IMDb (I think there is some internet hackers behind this because of the political subject of this movie) so i decide to register myself to IMDb to give a perfect note of this amazing movie The Promise. Bravo for the scenario, actors and actresses!!!I was wondering why we have being waiting so long for this movie to come out and show to the world how the genocide had happened at that time which it's more than hundred years ago.I am not Armenian. I am Vietnamese living in Quebec. A boat people from the 80'. Any war is horrifying me. But when the cruelty of humanity become an history fact: you must to recognize it, accept it and give a deep sincere apologize to all. That how we become a civilized society and move forward."
" Great movie!
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I thought the movie was nicely made. It had a beautiful story line set against a dark stained tragedy. This was a story that needed to be told, not just for Armenians, but for all of humanity. I find it pretty lame that nice movies don't have a chance to 'shine' due to fake-bad reviews. I find it even more lame that IMDb isn't able to filter out the BS!"
" A Powerful Movie, A Must See
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,9,"I was asked by a friend to watch this movie as it was very important and dear to her heart. I am so glad I did.Reviews for this movie have shocked me, it is almost like they did not watch the movie at all. The cast was phenomenal, the story was true, devastating, touching, and important, and I would recommend it to anyone.I would like to also put out there, for the record, while there is a story of love within this movie, it is NOT AT ALL a romance. If you come to this movie looking for something light-hearted, heavily romantic and with a cheerful, happy ending for all, you will be devastated."
" Excellent Movie and Great Depiction of the Armenian Genocide
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie was so wonderfully scripted and produced that I watched it twice already in the span of 3 days. It is great reminder of the atrocities of the Turkish Government against the Armenians in 1915. My grandparents were victims of the Genocide and walked the Aleppo dessert to escape it. We always need to be reminded and keep ""The Promise"" that such crimes will not occur anywhere in the world."
" Brilliant!
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"An emotional, mesmerizing, powerful movie that pictures the inexplicable sufferings of the Armenian population in Turkey, which till this day both the U.S and the Turkish government have not acknowledged. Nevertheless, this movie celebrates our ancestors' survival and growth. Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac, and Charlotte Le Bon play their roles magnificently. Definitely a contender for an Oscar nomination."
" My grandfather was a survivor of the Armenian Genocide
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"My grandfather was a survivor of the Armenian Genocide. His name was Kevork Norian (there's a few videos on YouTube of him highlighting his mission to bring to light the atrocities of what happened to the Armenians). I watched this film for him. I watched it in memory of him, and all the other Armenian's in what they went through. And unlike the initial fake bad reviews (uhum, Turk smear campaign), I actually saw the film. Now, I'm not a movie critic, but I felt the need to stand for this film and express my one voice. Because we all know, each person's voice counts. Together, we're stronger.Review of the movie: The cinematography was incredible, costume design so detailed, set and prop design was accurate for that time. The scale of the scenes was enormous and the scenery was beautiful. I got a better understanding visually of what the lands, people and places were like. This was clearly a big-budget film by Kirk Krikorian (owner of MGM). The acting was great. Oscar Isaac did a phenomenal job acting - he was very convincing. Emotionally played very well the spectrum of emotions needed for this film. The plot was interesting, and I liked how it was based on a non-fictional, a real person who retired in Watertown, MA (a town near my hometown). Christian Bale was amazing too. What I liked about his character was that he stood up for what he believed in and his principals, regardless of the consequence. I also liked that in the background of the dialogue between the actors or before a scene, I would hear Armenian, spoken which I recognized which was so exciting! I thought that was an awesome detail that they added to the scene which again made it more authentic. I'm sure the same was done with the Turkish scenes, but I don't know Turkish. If this is going to show the good and bad of the movie (a proper review) the one criticism I have was that the actress Shohreh Aghdashloo (who is a very good actress) wasn't able to pronounce the name ""Maral"" which was frustrating and cringe worthy. That was my only criticism. The criticism of the woman who was seated in my row (I mention her later) her criticism (we talked after the film) was that ""this only showed one person's story"" (the Doctors'). But my thought is that we all have stories of what each family went through (our history); moreover, how some people were slaughtered in front of their family members, some whose Armenian tongues were cut off because they refused to convert to Islam and speak Turkish, and some survived by the skin of their teeth. But in a 2 hour and 12 minute film, you can't convey the scope and emotions of the 1.5 million individual Armenians' personal stories. So my view is that they did a good job being concise, and choosing one interesting real story from one real person that they chose to showcase. I'm glad they did. I loved the quote that was highlighted at the end by William Saroyan, the last line that reads: ""For when two of them meet anywhere in the world, see if they will not create a New Armenia"". At the end of the film, I was elated that this film was made, and was put into theaters nationwide. Finally, someone was telling our story, and more importantly, our history. After the movie was finished, everyone was emotionally charged. I started clapping and it was contagious. Everyone else started clapping. I remained seated to read the credits, and when I was leaving, the woman in my row asked me, ""Are you Armenian?"" and I responded ""Ayo, Hye em"" (Yes, I'm Armenian) and I gave her a hug and kiss. I didn't know this woman, but this is what happens when ""two or more of us meet up anywhere in the world"". It was a beautiful moment. And with all that's going on in the world, the 101 years of continuous denial of the Turkish Government for the wrongdoing, and not taking responsibility for the genocide of 1.5 million Armenians is disgraceful. The reason why they aren't taking responsibility is because they would face accountability for what they did. We were part of the minority with Greeks and Assyrians. The reason we, as Armenians 101 years later are still talking about this is because there hasn't been restitution. What I also liked about this film was that they showed photographic proof of the scenes they showed. How can you deny photo documentation? In law, that's evidence. As a Christian, as hard as it is, I have forgiven what the Turks have done. But to have peace and a clean conscience, to the Turks and to the Turkish government: I will leave this with you - ""The truth shall set you free"" John 8:32."
" Dramatic tear-jerker & Excellent cinematic performance
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,9,"Excellent cast performance on a dramatic topic of human proportions in another time and place in history. You'll understand the existing friction between the Armenian,Greek,Assyrian Christian-folk inhabitants and a Turkish regime that continues to deny its government's dark events from a not-so-long ago era. Wow, why isn't this film getting the attention it deserves? Might take some background for the average joe but history buffs and film-lovers this story will move you!"
" Genocide deniers attack The Promise; Denial allows the crime to thrive today
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I couldn't stop my tears. A teenager walked out of the movie theater with his family. He was also wiping his eyes. We had just seen a powerful story of incredible pain and survival at an early afternoon showing of The Promise. Finally, some of my people's story is told. Perhaps not perfectly. After all this is Hollywood. It's tragic that it took $100,000,000 and 102 years to get the story of the Armenian genocide out to a somewhat wider audience than had been possible in the past.It's important to get this story out to silence deniers of genocide, any genocide, because this crime continues to torment humanity to this day through an unimaginably immense volume of killings, of physical and sexual torture and slavery, and the mass destruction of family, society, and culture, followed by the powerful and unconscionable politics and economics of denial which keeps genocide alive. Deniers of the Armenian genocide are actively and aggressively targeting this film.The next step for Armenians, survival and finding equity in the societies that they find themselves in, is more than just telling the story of genocide. It's also about reconnecting with humanity as Armenians,seeking justice for themselves and others, telling more varied stories and being heard, extending soothing words and a helping hand to an ailing world, and strengthening Armenian and endangered indigenous cultures and their unmatched contribution to humanity."
" Stunning movie; gives justice to horrific event
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This is a stunning movie set with the back drop of the Armenian Genocide, a horrific event that needs more visibility. The acting is incredible in particular Oscar Isaac who did an amazing and soulful performance of Mikael. It seamlessly weaves the story of love, family and tragedy and gives justice to the atrocities the Armenians had to endure. This is more than a film, it is a movement to bring awareness to social injustice. It took over 80 years to have this film depicted admist much controversy. All proceeds go to non profits. Go see the film and allow this important story to live on. ( Ignore the negative rating spam which was a systematic effort to see the film fail by those with other intentions that never saw it.)"
" A must see film.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Moving, touching, a film that touches us today. This movie captures all of the emotions of the Armenian Genocide, the first genocide of the 20th century. WW1 set the stage for the world we live in today. Without understanding this chapter in the history, one cannot fully understand our current events; events that are still unfolding in modern day Turkey and the Middle East. The acting is superb, the story is compelling, the message is inspiring."
" Meticulously detailed, historically accurate story of human survival
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"From its amazing cinematography to its captivating dialogues, The Promise takes the viewer on a journey of the love, hope and survival of the Armenian people during the Armenian Genocide, the systematic extermination of 1.5 million Armenians committed by the Ottoman Turks from 1915-1923. Armed with historically accurate details unknown by many, this movie focuses less on the horrific atrocities that the Armenians endured and more on the resilience of the Armenian people in their fight to survive and thrive. A love story amidst a tragic period in history, this movie will transport you into a world of Armenian culture and traditions. Oscar Isaac delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as the tormented young Armenian who witnesses the death of his family and his people. Christian Bale portrays a resilient American reporter who won't rest until the rest of the world learns the truth about the systematic extermination of the Armenians. Charlotte Le Bon and Angela Sarafyan give inspiring performances as the Armenian women whose love and strength defy all obstacles. The misguided reviews of critics illustrate the continued uneducated denials that plagues this subject matter, as they ignore the countless historical depictions and accounts of the survivors of the Armenian Genocide because of political suppression. A story that must be told - A must see epic movie!!!"

This is a part of history that is not well understood so I'm glad the story is being told. Great acting by Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac, and Charlotte Le Bon. Terry George did a great job directing this epic story."
" A love triangle is created in the midst of a war torn Turkey.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Being Armenian myself, I decided to pay tribute to the systematic killing that could have resulted in my great- grandparents to be murdered. I wasn't expecting much, but I was expecting a historically accurate drama with graphic scenery and intense themes of nationalism. I was right and then some; every single character had some kind of nationalism that motivated them through the genocide they were in the middle of. In terms of story, it was beautifully created and was plain to see within the words spoken and the distinct facial features shown. The pros were that the characters were chosen well except for, ""Ana,"" who stuck out like a sore, Caucasian thumb. She was casted poorly, but the rest were able to shine through. Another pro, yet with another con, was that Christian Bale's character, ""Chris,"" was acted supremely well, as I could expect no less from him, yet his character itself was too perfect with little to no conflict. ""Chris"" was selfless, forgiving, and overall an amazing human being despite the unnamed events that happen to him in the movie. One last complaint on the plot side was that there was a lot of skin being shown for a pg-13 movie, with sex occurring twice in the film. Anyway, on to the production side. Cinematography was average, nothing too bad, yet nothing special. There were a few shots that seemed unnecessary, and could actually be better if the original shot was left to linger, so I question the decision there, but there was nothing I could say was bad. The director did a great job with the story and the set design, but the acting direction was a bit weak. A few times, characters' movement was awkward and unnatural, but line delivery generally saved it. As I said, the set design was great, everything looked as it would and clothing looked like it was preserved from the time. The one thing that bothered me was the obvious green screen that could be seen whenever landscape shots were used. It was overtly seen and could have been covered up better. Overall, I enjoyed the film and would happily watch it again, it was intense at the right moments and cheerful at times when it was necessary. And to the people who deny the events of the Armenian Genocide, I would ask you to view the movie then look into the destruction the Turkish people caused. Believe it or not, the history of the film was fact and not fiction."
" A great movie and a must-see for everyone.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie provided so much truth on this subject and it was so beautifully made. It explained clearly what events occurred during that time and I recommend it to anyone and everyone I see. 10/10 must see.If your are at all curious about the Armenian Genocide and how it happened I urge you to see this movie This movie gives people a clear perspective on Armenians during that time.""We can either fight or die, and we choose to fight!"" Other than the story itself, the editing and production was beautifully made and , if it were up to me, this movie would be nominated for the best award there is."
" Keeps you on the edge of your seat
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,This movie is Oscar worthy. It is well acted and directed. It is the kind of movie you want to discuss with you friends and family after you've seen it. I highly recommend it. It is well worth your time and money. I could not stop myself from crying at the end. The main three actors did a marvelous job in creating memorable characters. The cinematography was excellent.
" A beautiful movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,This is an Oscar caliber movie. The cast is superior and the director brings a historical event that has been forgotten for over 102 years to humanity's attention.The movie forces each person to examine humanity and view the world from the eyes of a Genocide Survivor.A powerful and beautiful movie. A must see movie for everyone that wants to feel alive and human.
" The Promise
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,9,"The Promise is a powerful, a well-written, movie about the Armenian Genocide based in 1915. The Promise opened my eyes to a piece of the Armenian history. I appreciated the well-developed characters and costume. The Promise is a must see movie for 2017. I plan to watch this movie again soon with a friend. #Keep the promise."
" Great film. Academy Award deserving film.
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"A beautiful love story set during the last, awful days of the Ottoman Empire when a whole ethnic, indigenous population was destroyed. Great acting, outstanding cinematography and compelling narrative. The historical content of the film was obviously meticulously well-researched and truthfully presented. This film is Academy Award material."
" A must see movie!! It will touch your heart!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,I was very touched by this movie. The tragedy of loss of innocent lives is heart-breaking. It is truly unbelievable that this genocide continues to be denied by the Turkish government. I thought the acting was great. Oscar Issac deserves to get nominated for an Oscar. I hope many people get the chance to see this movie. It will impact you to your core. I am always terrified that human beings have the capacity to be so cruel and brutal and at the same time I am delighted that we have the capability to love and endure and survive the most horrific events.
" very nice movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"I like to recommend everyone to watch this movie. Stop politicize any historical movie.I don't have any personal hate to turks or so, but this was history and very well written, we all not playing hide and seek...""The promise"" has very beautiful story line and actors performance is excellent. Thanks to creators."
" A well made movie with fantastic acting that shows the truth during what was happening in turkey during ww1
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Wow, was surprised at how great this movie was! It's an amazing movie that shows the attempt of the Ottoman Turkish Government to eliminate all traces of the Armenian people. It's very easy to follow. The movie wasn't too violent but the audience is still able to briefly understand the horror to the Armenian people during that time. It was also a beautiful love story!!! Very well made and ALL MOVIE PROCEEDS GO TO CHARITY!!!! Get the tissues ready...."
" Would see again!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"I thought this was a great film, and will probably see it again. It included a lot more historical context than I expected based on some reviews I had read, but in my opinion that made it better. The overarching story and themes were, in truth, the best part of the film for me. It was a little hard to watch at times, certainly because of the history it's based off of, but also perhaps because several scenes made me think of the struggles that refugees are still going through today.I've seen some negative reviews of the love story, but I actually enjoyed it. My husband thought the love story was a bit schmaltzy for his taste, but he really liked the movie overall as well. Whether people enjoyed that part or not, everyone in the theater was touched enough to sit through all the rolling credits and didn't get up to leave until the lights came on. You don't see that too often.Overall, rating this an 8 out of 10. I have recommended it to my friends and would surely see it again."
" Relying on IMDb rating
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Before I would trust the ratings on IMDb whenever I wanted to learn about a movie I am interested in. But now, after the incidents of thousands of poor ratings on this movie long before its release, I would think twice before relying on IMDb rating. How careless of you to allow this to happen. Don't you have any filters to prevent such a nonsense to occur? I hope very much this would never happen again to any movie."
" Truth be told
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"""The Promise"" is educational and eye-opening, revealing the truth behind the atrocities of 1915. The cast, cinematography and story line are notable. I will see it again as I feel I was caught up in too much emotion to absorb some important details. I am suspicious of the negative reviews that were published before the movie was released to the general public on April 21st,- denial extends over 100 years."
" Great Film and Great Story
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***Copied from another user: ""Dear IMDb, Yesterday I stumbled upon an article about a film called 'The Promise' and how it has received an unprecedented amount of negative reviews on your site. This film has been screened three times, one being at the Toronto Film Festival on September 11, 2016. And yet it has over 55,000 1-star reviews. How is that possible? This film is about a touchy subject for many because it centers around the time the Ottoman Empire carried out a genocide against the Armenian people. But since it is not possible that all these people have seen the film considering the simple fact that it has not been released anywhere yet, how can people leave negative reviews about a film they've never seen? In my humble opinion, it really questions your website's credibility. This film was produced by someone who had a vision and his name was Kirk Kerkorian. He put many of his earnings on the line to put this movie into production. The director, Terry George, is one of the most renowned and respected in Hollywood. The cast is made up of countless brilliant actors. This film has quality written all over it and yet it is being unfairly rated down by people who haven't seen it. It is a known fact that the Turkish government and people have been denying this genocide for over a century and are willing to go to great lengths for it to remain unrecognized. But to allow your website to become a weapon of Turkish denial and propaganda is not the standard that your company set for itself when IMDb was launched. Your website has always been a respectable portal of knowledge about all films of the world, so I am in real disbelief as to why a film that has not been released to the public is being defamed and down-rated by Internet trolls. As I said, this whole situation just questions the validity of IMDb. Please do not allow this to keep happening. There are so many people who dedicated their time and effort to the making of this film. They spent millions of dollars to make it happen. This film tells a story of an event that the world needs to know about. And until people have the chance to see it with their own eyes and in turn draw their own conclusions, please do not allow this kind of spiteful rating to continue. Please do not let your site become another place of hateful political ranting. It only does you a great disservice."""
" MASTERFUL in every way
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"I am one who doesn't afford great reviews lightly. A film must earn it. It should have something exceptional about it.This one, has SO many exceptional things working for it. A definite must see for everyone from casual film goers to movie buffs. You will not be disappointed.--------------------Oh, and as a heads-up / reminder - I see many wonderful reviews for it, that have no rating. If you loved it, like I did, and you left a review, be sure you added your rating to it."
" Wonderfully done
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"The movie was amazingly done. Thankfully visually tame compared to the reality of many of the things that happened during the Genocide, but still able to help convey some of the weight of one of the most evil times/events in all of human history.Absolutely worth seeing. First as a great movie about events that are not as well known as they should be. And doubly so to spite the ""people"" (here the term is used loosely) who inherited the spirit of those who committed the genocide and are actively trying to silence the movie and it's message as much as possible, either by fake ""ratings"" on IMDb before the movie even came out (and therefore before they've seen it), or by other cowardly tactics like buying out movie theaters in Boston/Chicago and then returning tickets at the last moment to try and prevent other people from seeing it.The fact that these ""people"" are going to such lengths and sinking to such reprehensible actions should speak for itself. Do yourself a favor. Go see the movie. Learn about history and use that knowledge to change the present."
" Loved it!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,Finally a great movie about the Armenian Genocide. Hollywood is so behind. I am wishing they make more movies about this subject. Mr Issac played and acted Oscar worthy. Loved the story line and the clothes that they were wearing matched the times. I highly recommend this movie and I give it 2 thumbs up and 10 out of 10. A must watch!
" An outstanding film regarding an important and timely subject. A MUST SEE FILM.
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Terry George and the crew have done an exceptional job at bringing this important topic to life on the big screen. A topic that has been suppressed world wide by well organised and funded lobbying groups to conceal the truth of the crime. The genocide of the Armenians is a fact that has been omitted from the history books over the past 100 years. The climax of the film being set at musa dagh was perhaps a deliberate reference to the abandoned project of 'The 40 Days of Musa Dagh' where the Turkish lobby was able to silence Hollywood in the first half of the 20th century. Now, in 2017, the truth of this story is revealed in an epic way, and Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac, and Le Bon do an outstanding job at bringing the audience to 1915 and the reality faced by the Armenian civilian population living in the ottoman empire at the time. I highly recommend you see this film and tell your friends to do the same."
" Outstanding!!!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This is a must see movie. A love story that takes place during one of the greatest atrocities in the world ,the massacre of the Armenian people by the Turkish Ottoman Empire. The movie is captivating and heart wrenching. It was a tear jerker. The only thing that fell short was an explanation of why the Armenian people were massacred by the Turks. But at least the movie gets you wondering plenty enough to read about it on Google. So sad. Slaughtered like animals by a Muslim nation that wanted the extinction of the people of the first Christian nation."
" A Must See!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"I urge everyone to see this movie for themselves and be your own critic, rather than reading the false claims made in the previous reviews. Please look at where the reviews are coming from! Just another perfect example of how denial still plays a huge role, and how the deniers of such a horrific act in history will go to extreme lengths to fabricate facts. This movie is long overdue, and the story needs to be heard loud and clear! You are your own judge. See this movie!"
" Cinematic masterpiece
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Just watched #ThePromise. This was a moving emotional account of the terrible acts committed against Armenians and other minority's during world war I by the Ottoman Turkish government. The film was beautifully shot and starred #ChristianBale , #OscarIsaac who led an all star cast in this heart wrenching story. If you have not seen this movie, please, watch it. The massage of The Promise which deals with crimes and brutality against humanity should be carried on to prevent anything like this from happening ever again."
" Phenomenal
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"I've never hoped that one day the truth that was once only whispered out of fear of retaliation by Turkish government can now be proclaimed boldly from theater screens, thus making the denial of the genocide by Turkey not only senseless, but also pathetic. I want to thank the makers of the movie along with all the actors for their dedication to bringing the truth to light with such precision."
" Love Prevails, But Also Ruins The Film
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,5,"This movie is very interesting. It has huge controversy around it. The Turks are still denying that the Armenian genocide never happened and that they're evil pieces of **** who killed Turks, but there is the other opposing argument that the Armenian genocide did happen and that Turks were the ones that were slaughtering them all. Unfortunately, the Turks didn't go see this film. This film is essentially about a love triangle between a man, a woman, and another man. For about 70%, it focused more on the romance than the actual genocide itself, which is where the movie went wrong. The love story is generic and cliché like many other romantic dramas we've all seen before. Why focus on something less important than more about something important such as the Armenian genocide? The Armenian genocide is one of the worst massacres in history. Turning that into a subplot and giving us a half ass movie is the wrongest decision. I have no idea what Terry George was thinking. The Armenian genocide should've been the main plot. Sure, it's okay to have some romance, but keep it brief. When it is the genocide on screen, it's intense and gut wrenching. The film is competently directed and the acting is very good. The film has a budget of around $90 million and despite that having a great effect on the artistic value of the film, it is a bad business move. Open Road is looking to lose over $100 million already. The domestic box office shows too."
" Amazing movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,Great movie. Very touching and very close to the true facts. Does not whitewash history and provides very general but at the same time educational view. There were no dry eyes in the movie theater. Great movie. Loved it. Don't trust the fake reviews here. Go watch the movie and you will see how great it truly is.
" Must see movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"After reading the reviews, I went to see the movie today. It was an amazing movie along with great acting by Christian Bale, Charlotte Le Bon and Oscar IsaaC. They literally take you back in time showing you the power of love even during one of the darkest moments of human historyEven if you are politically motivated or live in the world of alternative facts you can learn a lot from this movie. I would however warn you in advance that it would be an emotional roller coaster for you."
" Its been a long time coming. Well done movie on a difficult subject.
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"The story is a familiar one. Small town young man, falls in love in a time of war and strife. The lovers and their story becomes overshadowed by the happenings of WWI and the genocide of the Armenians living as a Christian minority in Turkey. I've wondered how you can create a movie about genocide in a way that explains the horror of mass killings in a way that the audience can connect to. I am not sure that you can, but in my opinion this is a good try on a subject no one ever hears about. The cinematography is brilliant, the casting is great and the acting is first class. It is an epic film that deserves to be viewed. I found myself biting my cheek several times to keep from crying. I would like to see this subject developed in other films, because there is just so much here that one film can never do it justice. This is an excellent start."
" Moving Film!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"I was not informed about the Armenian deaths that occurred during World War I. I enjoyed the plot and the way they illustrated such a topic through a romantic story. It was touching and moving, not only to myself, but to my parents as well. This film comes at a perfect time, where the world is dealing with a refugee crisis. It was also inspiring to see the religious links from the Armenian people to American missionaries. Great film, overall! A must-watch!"
" Must see movie!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Heartbreaking story of tragedy and ultimately survival of the Armenian Christians. Story show the brutality of Turkish nationalists during the Ottoman Empire. The movie is very educational and need to be seen by all, especially in education systems. Knowing history is to prevent future genocides. The powerful acting, beautiful music this movie touched my heart. It is very sad that Turkish people until today continue Ottoman politics of ignoring the atrocities they have committed..."
" Incredibly touching movie, very well-made
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"I saw The Promise today, and I am still very much touched by this powerful film that celebrates survival, and ultimately human triumph set in the context of one of the darkest chapters of human history. The Armenian Genocide - the systematic annihilation of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, is portrayed in this movie through the lens of the main characters. The film is not too graphic, but it is extremely touching and powerful - you may need some tissues. It doesn't show too much explicit violence, hence its PG-13 rating. The movie is dynamic, relatively fast-paced, and cinematography is of superb quality. Different movie - one that makes you think, reflect upon the value of human life, and has great educational value as well. I highly recommend this film."
" Deeply Moving - Atrocity, Humanity, War, Love
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This film was truly exceptional. I thought perhaps it was more meaningful to me (than my friend) because I lived in Armenia for two years. But through our tears as the credits rolled, she shared how much she loved it, how much it moved her, and how much she learned. I'm not an Armenian, but my time there cultivated in me a love for the land and the people and a heightened awareness about the genocide and its lingering, unforgiving impact on millions of people around the world - the 11 million among the diaspora and the 2+ million still living in Hayastan today.The movie has a tender love story - sure, a triangle - but not unrealistic. The story is told beautifully; you will weep for love and loss. The landscape is reminiscent of Western Armenia (although shot in Spain, Portugal, and Malta). The atrocities against the Armenian people are captured in a few heart-wrenching scenes, but the story also includes enjoyable moments prior to the conflict, when Turks and Armenians lived in harmony in Istanbul (Constantinople).In the end, my sobs were audible - deep sorrow for the Armenians, for those I know today who still carry the scars left my memories and stories passed from generation to generation. But also I wept for the many individuals around the world who are living devastating, brutal, unfair realities today - Syrians, South Sudanese, Rohingya, Congolese of DRC, and so many more that don't ever make the headlines. Humans can be barbaric - killing innocent women, men, and children over identity, religion, power. My heart aches for humanity.See this film, then explore the history deeper and draw your own conclusions about the Armenian genocide and why only 28 countries and 45/50 US States have recognized the genocide for what it was."
" History coming to life
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie is fast paced, exciting, heartbreaking, but finally full of hope. The music is wonderful, haunting, and vibrant. The actors were excellent. I especially was impressed with Oscar Isaac. I would call this an epic story, much like Doctor Zhivago. Be sure to take some hankies with you! It seems that at some point, the Turkish government will do the honorable thing and admit what they did to the Armenian people. At this point in time honesty, I feel, would do more to aid in the redemption of their national character."
" Amazing!!!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"The complexities of the love triangle seem very genuine. The casting is excellent, and the characters live our their struggles with terrific conviction. The performances are superb. The writing is exquisite and the artistic liberties are undertaken with great care without compromising historical facts."
" Brilliance! Don't Believe the Trolls!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,9,"This movie tells the emotional truth of the genocide with a beautiful story. The acting, script, scenery are excellent. Don't believe the trolls with their one star ratings. Can you even imagine that these actors would sign up for a losing picture? Read the actor list and you will see. Only the very best. Bring your tissues; this movie will move you."
" Absolutely outstanding film.
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Visually stunning, moving dialogue and outstanding portrayals by every actor in this film. A gut wrenching look at the genocide of the Armenian people by the Ottoman Turks and as so, very disturbing. The film features a medical student who leaves his Armenian village to attend medical school in Constantinople. The physical settings are stunning and such a poignant backdrop to the suffering that this young man is about to endure. The story is told in a very moving, personal manner and when the lights went up, there wasn't a dry eye in the theater. Much like Schindler's List, it brings you face to face with people who suffered beyond all measure. See it. Bring tissues."
" Fantastic and applies to today
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This is a bit of unknown history. The history is important and it applies to today. ""Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it."" It is repeating. The plot was interesting. I was concerned about the love triangle, but it wasn't ugly like I expected. It was real and believable. This movie is 70 years in the making and based on a true story. I highly recommend it and I haven't felt that way about a movie in a very long time."
" Powerful and historically accurate film with a very relevant message!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,9,"The Promise tells the still seemingly untold story of the Armenian Genocide that occurred in the beginning of the 20th century. The plot revolves around a young man, Mikael, who falls in love with a woman, Ana, and follows them through their journey in Turkey, where they see their families destroyed at the hands of the Ottoman Empire.The plot keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire time, with very powerful moments and quotes that reveal how relevant this movie is today, in a time of multiple crises that we are currently witnessing such as the refugee crisis, civil war in Syria, and so on. There simply couldn't be a better time for this movie to come out.The movie stars A-list actors like Christian Bale, and has wonderful performances by all the stars, including Oscar Isaac and even appearances by the famous Jean Reno."
" Watching this epic story was like watching the history of my own family
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"There is something very special about the revelation of a long, stifled truth. Watching this grand film gives me hope that those who view it will know about this great injustice, the first genocide in modern history. The movie was discrete on many fronts so as not to take away from the real story of survival, sacrifice, love and triumph. There is no sugar coating the premeditated murder of a country's own law-abiding citizens. What was included was significantly toned down from the accounts of my own family members who survived these brutal atrocities. It is by the grace of God we are here now. The ultimate triumph has been the canonization of the 1.5 million martyrs to sainthood in the Armenian church. I was proud the movie included an endearing and sacrificial friendship between a Turk and an Armenian. My own grand-mother was saved by her Turkish neighbors. The movie's proceeds go to charity. I would encourage you to see it with a friend then talk about it over a beverage of your choice. There is much to discuss."
" Disturbing but hopeful
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. What beautiful scenery and acting. A historical film is always educational, and this film will tell the story that so many don't know. The cinematography is outstanding. The actors are very moving in the portrayal of each character. It is a long movie, but it really needed to be in order to tell the full story."
" Amazing 10 stars from Me.
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This is a beautiful Oscar worthy story. My wife and I cried so many times. The Promise is a complete emotional roller coaster of a movie. The acting is amazing! I didn't even want to go see this movie but my wife pushed me to go and take her to see it, and I'm really glad she did."
" Powerful, historical film
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,9,"Just saw this movie last night and was without a doubt moved by it. The Promise provides an honest and accurate view into the events surrounding the Armenian Genocide, albeit with some romance thrown in to keep broader audiences interested. If you don't know anything about the Armenian Genocide, this film is a good primer while also being a compelling film in its own right. If you are already well-informed or are a descendant of a survivor, you will not be disappointed by The Promise. The majority of the film is focused on the plights of the major characters, which at times seemed to downplay the enormity of what was happening across the Ottoman Empire. However, it builds nicely to an emotional ending. As a native Armenian speaker, it was nice to hear some Armenian spoken at the end, as opposed to the variety of accents the Armenian characters had going and the word or two of Armenian that was interspersed in the background throughout the movie. Stick around for actual photo footage at the end."
" A great movie must be seen. it's a part of History that everyone should know.
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"The Promise is One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. It's not only about a massacre and all the lives that have been taken, but it also is a wonderful love story. Worth to watch whether you Armenian or not. It is part of a History that should not be forgotten. The actors did such a wonderful job. Please go and enjoy this movie and let us know how this wonderful story touched your heart. ALL amazing actors and director put such great effort in showing something that has been denied for many years."
" Must watch
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,The best movie that shows the true side of Armenian genocide. I will definitely recommend to watch it. The film is beautifully shot with the touching love story. The actors are incredible and so the plot. Whoever is rating the film 1 out of 10 is not actually rating the film but providing political feedback. And I'm doubting that they have watched it.
" Must see!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"It was an amazing movie. A great depiction of the massacre of the Armenian people. It really made me appreciate my family and my culture more, being an Armenian. The only thing that upset me is that It didn't have more of an Armenian cast. The man guy was amazing though! I wish they taught the Armenian genocide more in American schools. But I digress, it was beautifully made and I would definitely recommend it!"
" Good movie, great cast!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Just saw the movie and find it great. Brought tears to my and everyone else's eyes. You can continue denying the genocide, but that will not change the facts, and I will believe my grandmother's stories more than you. She told us all the horrors she went through, and was the only one from her family that survived."
" Gorgeous and Moving Epic, Championing the Power of Love and Courage
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"""The Promise"" is a gorgeous epic on a scale seldom attained today. The film is an ode to the power of love – not just romantic love, but familial and human love and compassion. While Mikayel, Anna, and Chris see their lives forever torn asunder by the cruelty of genocide and war, there are thousands of acts of love, kindness, and bravery, from Armenians, Turks, and foreigners, that really highlight the power of the human capacity to empathize and fight for survival.The performances are moving and truly fantastic. The story alone, of the first genocide of the 20th century, denied to this day by Turkey's government, is incredibly compelling to Armenians and non-Armenians alike. However, the gorgeous acting, particularly of Oscar Isaac, Shohreh Aghdashloo, and Marwan Kenzari (a truly underrated gem), elevated the film, drawing both copious tears and laughs from the entire audience. Each character, however small, is beautifully crafted, written, and performed – Emre, Reverand Antreassian, and the unnamed Armenian clown were especially moving supporting characters.From the opulence of Constantinople to the sweeping and imposing shots of Musa Dagh, the backdrop of the movie is stunning. The costumes and setting details are also both lovely and historically accurate. Even in the most tragic of scenes, the audience is constantly blown away by the drama of not just the political and humanitarian issues driving the plot, but also of the pure power of nature. The film is as much an ode to the Armenian people and humanity as it is to the once-great Ottoman Empire and the nostalgia of a bygone era.The filmmakers did a phenomenal job of infusing historical accuracy and realism into the film. I recognized many lines directly taken from accounts of the Genocide, including those of Ambassador Morgenthau, and many events, which I've been amused to see critics describe as over-the-top, were directly taken from historical accounts. I found the inclusion of the protestant minister and the brief but moving footage of Komidas Varjapet (singing, in the church, bringing Mikayel and Anna to tears) particularly gorgeous.I cannot recommend this movie enough. It is fast-paced, evocative, and leaves you with a sense of not despair or sorrow, but one of the capacity of humanity to care for each other and act not as selfish individuals, but as unified groups."
" The Promise Movie Review
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"It's about time. It's about time a movie that has both great historical significance, and modern day pertinence, get made and have it's day in the sun. Oscar Isaac shines - and is simply fantastic, delivering an Oscar caliber performance that will bring you to tears. The film has some flaws, yes, like a trite love triangle, but it makes up for it by telling a completely original and often forgotten Genocide story. Set in 1915 Turkey, the world is at war, and with the cloak of war covering everyone's eyes, the Turks commit the murder of 1.5 Million of it's minority Christian Armenian civilian citizens, in an effort to spread Muslim Pan-Turkism, ultimately creating the country of Turkey as we know it today. The German Nazis (allies of Turkey in WWI and WWII) would then use this forgotten Genocide as a playbook for orchestrating the Holocaust in WWII. This film is undoubtedly one of the smartest films of the year, and in my opinion one of the 10 best movies of 2017. See it!"
" Spectacular movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie is spectacular! I saw it yesterday, which was the movie's opening day here in the US.I love history and historic movies. Although the characters and their specific lives are fictional, the whole movie depicts a very interesting (and terrible) episode of the history of the 20th century. The Ottoman Empire was crumbling, Turkey entered what would later be called the First World War, and the Turks decided to exterminate their Armenian population.I really liked the actors, Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac, Charlotte Le Bon, Angela Sarafyan and the whole cast did a very good job. Photography was excellent, there were stunning landscapes and as I viewer I really felt transported back to the beginning of the 20th century. Constantinople (now Istanbul) was so beautifully portrayed, as well as the landscapes around Siroun and Musa Dagh. I hope to visits those lands some day."
" Very good movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"To be short,excellent performances by main cast,not so atmospheric tho,somewhat unconvincing love story but historically accurate. I watched it at cinema but I feel it's somewhat more of a home movie for lovers of historical titlesRegarding historical accuracy,we Europeans best know what kind of people are Turks,we still have their remains in our back yard. 8/10 is a fair score IMHO."
" Suspenseful movie with fabulous characters
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie last night and I really enjoyed it. It was very suspenseful and my eyes were glued to the screen to the point that I couldn't even look at my phone when I got a text! I just really wanted to see what happens next. The characters are like-able, real, raw and draw you into the story. The acting is phenomenal. You get drawn into their emotions and feel their love, grief, pain and joy. From reading many history books about the Ottoman Empire, I think the movie was very accurate and true. I think the film could have used another hour because I know from my readings that there was so much more they could have shown, but the point of the movie was achieved and it was overall a great movie.. probably one of my favorites! Ill probably see it again because I really did like all the characters and the anticipation from scene to scene was superb!"
" An epic period movie that does justice to the memory of The Armenian Genocide and treats the subject with utmost respect.
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"The subject of the Armenian Genocide is very near and dear to Armenians and myself, and this review is not for my Armenian friends, but rather, my non-Armenian friends. Before seeing this film, I read about the big budget that went into it's production. Of course, this is a big beautiful motion picture, with terrific cast of Oscar worthy acting by Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon, with large scenes of sunsets and vistas, and a director who is a master of his craft. It starts by bringing our focus to a love triangle, which is a vehicle to take us to the real history that unfolds in front of our eyes. It touches a human chord that I have rarely experienced recently watching a movie. Terry George has handled the subject with utmost care and respect, and tells the story in such a way that took us into the period, and walks us through the atrocities, without the gore, and brings us to an inspiring finale with the triumph of the human spirit over extreme adversity and brutality.On behalf of our Armenian ancestors and the Armenian people, we thank you Mr George, for making such a beautiful motion picture and bringing the truth to the world in a very palatable way."
" The fake reviews
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"GREAT MOVIE, Before the the movie even opened to the public, there was already over hundred thousand reviews on this page giving it a low or negative review. It is a shame that IMDb lets fake reviews to alter the real review for the movie. Every review before the opening date should be looked at and taken down. Other then real, professional critics and reviewers who actually watched the movie. This movie gave a great way to educate people, adults, kids, people who never heard of the Armenian Genocide, to learn what happened. They could of gone the other way and showed a lot of violence, blood, gore, horrors of what really happened to our people, but this movie went the way to tell the story in a way anyone can watch and learn.This was a great movie, everyone should watch it and learn what happened in our history, during the time of our grandparents, how cruel, and brutal the ottoman empire was, and how still history is repeating itself. They, the modern Turks, can deny all they want. we know what really happened, I've heard the stories from my grandmother, grandfather, what happened to them, how they ended up in Lebanon or Syria, why we were born in Lebanon. This Movie shows why, and that we are still here and we will never forget until the Turks accept responsibility and admit what happened. GREAT MOVIE..."
" Amazing Film
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,Well produced film! Def worth seeing! Bonus that it exposes the truth about the Armenian Genocide! There are a lot of fraudulent reviews on here from people who have not even seen the film! It really is sad and pathetic that it has come to this. When will the truth be accepted?! Please support the film and go out and see it! You will not be disappointed.
" A love story within the tragedy of a nation
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Great movie, this is the best that I have seen in the last 30 years. Very impartial, even depicted some turks who attempted to save innocent lives. The movieIts well documented the true historical event and barbarism inflicted on Christian population in Turkey. Unfortunately denial of Armenian genocide has contributed to the Jewish Holocaust and other atrocities including what is happening in this 21th century with ISIS. A must, must see movie and deserve to receive an academy award."
" A beautiful movie of an awful event
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"My Armenian great-grandparents and grandparents lived through the genocide, so I remember many of their stories about the horrors of what they lived through. The accuracy of this movie compared to what I was told as a child is amazing. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone so I won't go into any detail, but sitting in the theater was like listening again to their voices. The movie was obviously a sanitized version of the events, but I think it had to be made this way so people could grasp what happened. If the truth were depicted, I don't think anyone would care to see the movie. There is a love story in the movie, but I think it is actually useful in portraying the profound sense of loss felt by the main characters, who, of course, are representative of all Armenians. As a side note, my grandmother was going to be ""adopted"" by Talaat Pasha but ended up being ""adopted"" by another high ranking official of the Turkish state, and another side of the family fought at Musa Dagh. The movie was a sensitive portrayal of a heretofore little known historical event, that, curiously, has great meaning in the times we are living in now."
" Great movie!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Went to see The Promise last night with my family, 3 generations were there. The movie was amazing! God bless Kirk Kerkorian for making this film so that people can see what really happened to the Armenians. So grateful that my ancestors made it out alive so that future generations could be born. They did a great job of creating the emotions of the people in the movie without being so graphic that we couldn't show it to young people. But you will need some tissues! If you are Armenian or not, go see the movie! It's very well done. The actors are superb. And it tells an ancient story that needed to be told for many many years and now has finally been told."
" Powerful movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"I was thrilled to attend "" The Promise"" last night with my fellow Armenians. This was a very powerful movie and tastefully presented. I definitely felt it will educate those people who knew nothing of the Armenian Genocide, let alone the Armenian people. We are a strong people and have prevailed. I just wish that my late father would have lived to see this film.Thank you to all those persons who worked tirelessly to make this happen. I highly recommend this movie. Thank you."
" PROUD to be an ARMENIAN
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"The Armenian Genocide, also known as the Armenian Holocaust was the Ottoman government's systematic extermination of over 1.5 millions including my great grandparents. This movie touches only the bare minimum of what actually happened, this movie is only the beginning of what is yet to come. The world needs to see and hear more about the decision to carry out a genocide against the brilliant, smart and innovative Armenian people was made by the political party in power in the Ottoman Empire. Hundreds of thousands were butchered outright. Many others died of starvation, exhaustion, & epidemics which ravaged the concentration camps. MUST go see THE PROMISE."
" Go watch The Promise for yourself
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Many of the negative reviews are unwarranted. The Promise is truly a good film in my opinion.Don't listen to the other negative reviews, most of which come from descendants of the Ottoman Empire (who are negatively portrayed in this film). Please go watch The Promise for yourself and form your own opinion."
" An Epic, Sweeping Masterpiece of a Film, finally telling the real story!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"""The Promise"" is a superb, epic film about the Armenian genocide. I saw it last night and sobbed throughout it, the first time during an early scene in which many men of the Armenian intelligentsia (doctors, scientists, academics) were lined up on their knees and executed by the Turkish army. What came to mind was the attempt at the ""stripping of dignity"" of these men by cowardly tyrants. It made me grieve for my Armenian ancestors, especially the ones who didn't manage to escape. My grandfather was one of the lucky ones, and though I don't know the particulars of his story I have heard that eight of his brothers did not make it out alive. The film is set in the early 1900's in Turkey. The color palette is made up of muted golds and sepia tones of a ancient painting. The small cities built of earthen materials, the towers, the dirt roads and the mountain desert landscapes are beautiful and sweeping. We are introduced to Mikael, a handsome medical student with dark eyes and a kind, intelligent soul who reminded me very much of my father who was also a doctor, though in America. We watch as Mikael meets and falls in love with Ana, a lovely woman who finds her true home in Mikael's Armenian heart. Chris, played by Christian Bale, is based on a real and renowned American journalist who is the first to relay the information to America about what is really going on, despite the Turkish government's denial of their forced death marches, burning of villages, drownings in the rivers and mass slaughtering of the Armenian people (in the end, a million and a half Armenians were killed). To this day the Turkish government denies it. Shame on them.My grandparents did escape and somehow managed to settle in Canada, where my father was born. My aunt Alyce was an orphan who they took in and raised. She had been marched through the scorching desert at the age of 4 and had seen her family killed—yet she survived and escaped—very much like some of the orphans in the film. Seeing these scenes of what ""my people"" went through brought tears again and again, for though I'd heard some stories and read books (like ""Forty Days of Musa Dagh"") nothing can prepare you for witnessing the heartlessness and brutality that blood-thirsty tyrants get off on inflicting on those whom they want to wield power over. (Jealousy, perhaps? The Armenians were a thriving, intelligent people) I read a theory somewhere that human survival has evolved two types of humans— those that subscribe to the ""dog eat dog, every man for himself"" selfish, brutal, cold-hearted type of destroying others to ""win"" and then the ""let's help, love and take care of each other"" types that don't wish to harm anyone, knowing that we're all in this together. Both types have used their methods to survive and procreate and maybe it's even a genetic difference as to which camp one lives in. I don't know, and yet I'm glad that the loving survivors and their offspring and their offspring's offspring have lived to tell this story, making the case for love—which ultimately is the highest power, the jewel in the crown and the way of the future if we are to survive as a species on this planet. May love prevail always! Amen.P.S. The Turkish government still denies the genocide to this day. Why? And why would Trump call to congratulate their dictator on his recent ""win""? I can see which camp these types live in, and I'll steer clear, thank you very much."
" History repeating itself
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"The Promise is a beautifully written story about the Armenian Genocide committed by Turkey. It tells what happened, how it happened, and how we can never let this happen again. The movie gives glimpses into life in 1915 Constantinople, smaller rural villages, and ""life on the run"" as it follows the life of Mikael from a young man wanting to become a physician to an midlife Mikael as a physician in Massachusetts and what he endures."
" Excellent movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Excellent movie with accurate historical facts. The events reflect what historians have confirmed based on historic archives and academic research. Enjoyed watching it. Highly recommended. The plot is interesting, the cast is first class, and the production is unique. Terry George has done it again, just like. When he excelled by directing Hotel Rwanda. A production of this magnitude on the Armenian Genocide was long over due. The Promise is a victory for truth ...."
" Excellent, Moving Film!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Yeva's story in this movie reminded me of my grandmother's story. She was 6 years old in 1915, while trying to escape from the Turks in Sasun, part of the historical Armenian Highlands - with her mother and 3 sisters. My grandmother and her older sister escaped, but they lost their two younger sisters... and their mother..."
" A significant step forward in history
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This is a beautiful, honest, and powerful film. It marks Hollywood's first ever feature made on the story of the Armenian Genocide. I urge everyone to go see this movie, as it artistically offers exposure to a facet of history that is all too often ignored. A wonderful movie creation, but more importantly a significant contribution to the voices of Armenians. Without acknowledging our history, we prolong the inhumane injustice of millions of souls, whose culture I share. My wish is for everyone to recognize and learn about the history of my people, beginning with seeing this truly moving picture. You will not regret it."
" A MUST See!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Excellent cinematography, enchanting characters, and an incredible story. The historical details and the intense drama were so moving and powerful. The Armenian genocide was a horrific atrocity that the Turkish government deny's to this day. People need to see this movie and learn about a part of history of a nation of survivors. The love story was also so captivating and realistic. Go see it!"
" A must see movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"I liked the quote at the end by William Saroyan ""I should like to see any power of the world destroy this race, this small tribe of unimportant people, whose wars have all been fought and lost, whose structures have crumbled, literature is unread, music is unheard, and prayers are no more answered. Go ahead, destroy Armenia . See if you can do it. Send them into the desert without bread or water. Burn their homes and churches. Then see if they will not laugh, sing and pray again. For when two of them meet anywhere in the world, see if they will not create a New Armenia."""
" The Promise is a true story
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Finally the truth is told for millions of viewers to see. This is an amazing film of the untold true story about the massacre of millions of Armenians. So sad to re-live the past but happy that everyone can educate themselves on the Armenian history. Watch the truth about the Armenian Genocide of April 24, 1915."
" Engaging
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie gives you what every successful movies should, an window into a world you might otherwise not know. The writing, the acting, the costumes, the sets, all are perfectly aligned to tell a horrific story with eloquence. Terry George did a phenomenal job with Hotel Rwanda. He does a phenomenal job with The Promise, giving us a slice of history that needs to be told. This movie doesn't hit you over the head with the horror, but takes you through the lives of those trying to survive the horror of their world. Absolutely engaging, heartbreaking, and inspiring."
" Must watch movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,The movie was a great recognition of the genocide that occurred to the Armenians. The added story line of the love triangle made the movie complete. This movie is a great representation of the struggles that refugees have gone through and how hard their lives can get. This is a must watch movie that unfortunately is receiving negative reviews primarily by Turkish nationals that fail to recognize the atrocities that occurred throughout 1915.
" Excellent,
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"The promise, This is a WONDERFUL MOVIE that shows how human rights are being deny to so many innocent people. It portrays the reality of cruelty to those innocent souls that their only fault at the time was to believe in Jesus Christ. Our ancestors were killed but we are the remaining of the only survivors of this terrible massacre that happen 100 years ago. We as the survivors should be together to defeat and defend human rights of any one who tried to deny us WE ARMENIANS SHOULD STAND TOGETHER FOREVER"
" For some, reality is not comfortable.
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"First, this is a lovely film. And a terrific history lesson. I suppose, if I were not Armenian, I could watch it without intense emotion. And since I have family who were directly involved in the massacres, this film has left me with a sense of sadness and anger, yet joyful that this story has finally reached the screen, albeit not without attempted interference from the Turks. We are thankful to Mr. Kerkorian and Survival Pictures for making this film come to life. After all, it was Hitler, embarking on mass extermination of the Jews, who said ""whoever speaks of the Armenians anymore?"""
" Very important film
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,I recommend that everyone see this film. It tells a largely untold story about the Armenian genocide and weaves in a bittersweet love story. The actors play their roles passionately and with utmost dignity. I think this is an incredibly important film and while the subject matter is heavy it is ultimately an uplifting story. All proceeds from the theatrical release are going to nonprofits! (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/promise-film-proceeds-donated- nonprofits-978409)
" Must See Film
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This was an incredibly moving film. The cast was phenomenal and really was able to portray the incredibly gut wrenching history of the Armenian Genocide. Its powerful and moving message should be one that everyone is able to hear. The complex dynamic between the characters represents a much larger metaphor. Must see this film, it is not to be missed!"
" Great movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Great movie, shows the suffering of Armenians, their great spirit and strength throughout that difficult time in history. It is a love story combined with horrible scenes of truth that never can be forgotten. I would recommend everyone to go see the movie. It is a wonderful movie with great cast and in my opinion a Oscar worthy film."
" A brilliant love story that flawlessly gives insight into the Armenian Genocide.
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely loved it. It was extremely moving. I went with a group of friends and there was so much to talk about and discuss after the movie. If you are looking for a moving and captivating film to sink your teeth into, this is for you. I encourage you to take your friends; you won't regret it. It may be fun to look up the history of the Armenian Genocide either before or after, to further give the movie context."
" Ver well made movie.
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,9,"I am not surprised Kirk Kerkorian spent $100 million on this movie. It was very well made, has great actors with terrific acting, beautiful scenery and a realistic love story. Overall, I ended up liking this movie much more than I thought I would. Ambassador Morganthau's rendition at the end was a bit different and not fully portrayed in the movie, and you can check that out in his Autobiography which goes deeper into his opinion about the topic. That's why I gave this movie 9 out of 10. But overall, wonderful movie. And all the proceeds from the movie are going to charity! I don't this this has ever been done before. Such a good movie, and I highly recommend."
" The Promise
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"The Promise was an excellent film. The scenery, cinematography, direction, and acting were outstanding. The music was beautiful. It is a multi-layered story of love, life, family, culture, humanity, and survival. You feel as though you are drawn into the story, actively participating in the plot. While you are grieving for the characters, you are simultaneously inspired by them. Ironically, one of the heroes of the film happens to be a young Turkish student who befriends the protagonist of the film , Mikeal. The film is very moving and has an appeal and an importance to everyone, young and old. A special thank you to the late Kirk Kerkorian for making this film( and donating the proceeds to human rights causes,) because so many attempts to make the Armenian genocide known to the world have been undermined and sabotaged by the Turkish government. Based on historic fact, The Promise tells the story of the first genocide of the 20th century. Although it is specific to the Armenian genocide, the story is universal, and cannot be denied."
" Awesome movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,Amazing!!! They were able to incorporate a beautiful love story in the midst of tragedy! Very well written and most importantly an accurate depiction of the truth. Very impressed. Definite tear jerk-er on all ends. Showed that even in the most dire circumstances and atrocities love will always prevail over hate and prejudice.
" Must See
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"The Promise was a long awaited movie which informed those who were not familiar with the atrocities in 1915. A must see for all as this was a subject never discussed in the history books. Our government still will not recognize the events as a genocide so not to hurt the feelings of the Turks. As a descendant of a genocide survivor, I Promise not to forget."
" Rate art both for production values and service to society
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"The objective of this film is to serve humanity and guide the actions of present and future people and their leaders to prevent repeating the past violations. The film is a vehicle to achieve this objective. In this instance the production values (cast/story line/personalizing) resulted in a deep understanding that helps viewers to enjoy a special personal experience and to act upon what is learned from being there. While growing up in the U.S., my parents told me in detail the horrors that they experienced and through luck and determination they survived. Seeing my parents' life stories, especially desert scenes, moved my mind images to almost being there. The totality of this a successful piece of work and should not be missed."

" A story of the Armenian people's hardship in Turkey during the Armenian Genocide
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"A beautifully shot and heartbreaking film that I would encourage everyone to see. This film showed the history of a nation of people and the hardships their kind has endured. Whether it to be for the romance or to learn about a rich history, I would recommend watching this movie. It does contain scenes from war that may be graphic for some people, however it portrays a very real event in the history of Armenians."
" A love story midst ethnic cleansing

A must see!
" Beautiful Movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie was truly incredible and moved me to tears. I am an Armenian descent. I have read a book before, similar to this movie named Orhans Inhertiance. Reading about what happened during these years, is different than seeing with your own eyes. The stories I have heard from family, the book that I read, and now this movie. It hurts my heart to know that we went through this amount of torture and pain and still continue to do so. This movie has a lot of emotions going on. You start with happiness, moving to love, then slowly going through the darkness of emotions with some light shinning in. I recommend all my family and friends to watch this. I have friends out of the Armenian race, who see me as their one and only Armenian friend and they were brought to tears watching this movie. #1915NeverAgain #Wearestillhereandstronger"
" Controversy and opportunity
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Like everything else that seeks to bring attention to the Armenian Genocide, The Promise has evoked much alarm and criticism from Turkey. The movie seeks to bring drama to the awful events that took place in Ottoman Turkey at the outset of World War I. Those who might criticize it should first read any history book about what happened during that horrific period, and come to realize what devastation was done to the Armenian people. Whether one party/group or another was seeking to ally with Russians to the east is immaterial when the horror of what was done - and continued to be denied! - is considered: a people who had lived in that region for centuries, perhaps as far back as the Bronze Age, were ripped away from it and all their cultural institutions, from churches to neighborhoods, destroyed. Yet we were not destroyed. This most lively of people survived and live in nearly every neighborhood in the world - from Los Angeles to Addis Abba --- making friends, thriving with our families, doing God's work. Get to know us and our history, whether through this movie, Saroyan short stories, the songs of Charles Aznavour or System of The Down. This movie shows that what Talaat Pasha and the Young Party did to the Armenians was brutal and unforgivable but the movie also provides a bridge to understanding, recognition and acceptance. Let us prove Hitler wrong once and for all when he told his generals as they were poised to begin a civilian onslaught 25 years after the Genocide, ""Who now Remembers The Armenians...?"" Lets try to cross that bridge and show that even more than a century later, the world remembers them and will learn from what happened to them."
" The Promise, A must see Movie .Thumbs up .
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,A very moving Movie .Great acting .Great shots .Worth seeing . It is about the Armenians who were systematically slaughtered and driven out of their villages and towns The movie portrays the suffering of the Armenian population and the injustice they went through under the hands of the Ottoman army . Till today the Turkish Government refuses to acknowledge that It was a Genocide . The movie the Promise clearly shows it was a systematic plan to annihilate the Armenian population from that region . Please go and see the movie. You will not regret it . You will learn about what happened to the Armenians during that period 1914 1915 My father was a survivor of the genocide .
" Incredibly Brave And Accurate Historical Drama
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This is the first major Hollywood movie to deal directly with a subject forbidden to Turkish citizens and vehemently denied and distorted by the Turkish government for 100 years. For this fact alone, it is a great and unprecedented film. It's the story of a love triangle during the time of genocide. It illustrates how love can overcome hate and prejudice. It does not depict the violence perpetrated against 2.5 million loyal citizens of the Ottoman Empire. It does not directly show the incredible hatred whipped up by the nationalist Muslim government against its Christian subjects. It doesn't focus on the million and a half Armenians slaughtered like sheep in a systematic way by the government that was supposed to protect them. Instead, the movie spotlights love, survival and hope. Because of its trail-blazing nature alone, this is a monumental work. Let's hope this trail-blazer will be followed by others that honestly depict the Armenian Genocide in an open and direct way without government sponsored censorship and denial. The Turkish deniers of history will sleep better at night once they own up with their history. Modern Germans have come to terms with their history and it's time for contemporary Turks to do the same. If you read this entire review, please go see this monumental movie, for it is much deeper than mere entertainment. It's the kind of movie that you will think about for some time to come."

Super educational without any bloodshed showing and without any near truly what actually went on during the Armenian Genocide as told us from our grand parents who went through the reality of events. This is a must see Movie. It is beautifully made, with superb acting, cleverly made and as simple and simply told as possible for the World to see. The good in Humanity should prevail. It is too sad that same thing is happening now in the same location Syria, Der Zor, Aleppo, to the grandchildren of those few survivors after 102 years of Armenian Genocide. Wake up world and let us together remember and avoid atrocities of the evils. PEACE to the WORLD."
" The promise
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Taking my culture out of this movie I thought it was non stop tasteful film leaving me hungry for more. While focusing on a love story I thought facts about the genocide were brilliantly put in. Neither story overshadowed one another and I believe this film was truly brilliant. Do yourself a favor and see the movie, the truth, which has been sweated under the carpet from political injustice."
" A reckoning to the world regarding the truth about the Genocide of the Armenians that began on April 24th 1915
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This movie had it all, a love triangle, if not a square. Murder, mayhem, lies (which still exist today) and finally truth. #turkeyfailed and will continually fail as we seek out our revenge by just surviving! I am amazed at the acting and producing of a movie that wrenches your soul, and brings the truth of what MY ancestors withstood for me to be here. Tell me it is all a lie, and the 1.5 million that were MURDERED will fill my soul, and you will see what an Armenian is truly capable of. Like the men & women of Musa Dagh that with held the Turkish soldiers for 40 days with old weapons and rocks, we will fight FOREVER to have the truth be told. Kirk Krikorian is proud of his final work to be reviewed WORLD WIDE. God Bless Armenians everywhere. God Bless everyone who worked to make this movie, and God Bless all the recognize."
" Amazing Movie!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"This was an amazing movie! This movie only shows you just a small amount of what really took place during April 24 1915-1917, But it's enough to show you the pain struggle and the mass exterminations of the Armenian people by the Turkish Government. They have been trying to hide this from their people and the world for 102 years, but soon all their lies and will come out, The entire world already knows what they have done. I'm a Strong and Proud Armenian and not even the Turkish Government can tell me otherwise! ""Our Only Revenge Will Be To Survive"" and we did Survive, and where stronger then ever!!"
" A must see movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,9,"I saw The Promise last night, and i highly recommend it to all. Parts of it retold what my father witnessed starting in 1915 when his entire family was killed him as the only survivor at the age of 4 or 5. The genocide story depicted is truthful and worth seeing and remembering. The love triangle story at the forefront helps build a narrative. The actors and production values are excellent. Please go see it and thumb your nose at the multi million $ Turkish lobby who is trying to suppress this movie."
" Fantastic - This is a must see
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,This is a must see film - not only for Armenians - but for everyone. Terry George did an amazing job of capturing the events of the Armenian Genocide - which is still not recognized as a genocide despite the mass murder of 1.5 million Armenians (committed by the Ottoman Turks). Beautifully done. I would recommend this to all of my family and friends.
" A beautifully depicted love story and history lesson
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac, and Charlotte Le Bon play so well in their roles. The perfect portrayal of such a difficult time for so many people. Finally Hollywood has gotten it right. For the past 102 years the Genocide has not been acknowledged. All these negative reviews trying to bring ratings down, but there is no way this movie should be a 5.4/10."
" The Promise is an excellent telling of the Armenian Genocide using fictional characters to tell a moving account.
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,9,"This is sound attempt to tell the story of one of the great tragedies of human history. The movie is an historically accurate portrayal using historical fiction of a family and love story around which to relate the plot. The Young Turks in a crumbling Ottoman Empire chose to unify their country by destroying the Christian minorities especially the Armenians. Modern Turks could save themselves tremendous amounts of money and political capital by simply admitting they made a horrible choice and committed genocide. They killed, massacred, destroyed, whatever you want to call it two-thirds of the Armenians, most all of the Assyrians, and a good percentage of the Greeks living mostly living as loyal subjects of the Ottoman Empire. The world knows it happened The movie has its flaws but historical accuracy is one of its great strengths not one of its flaws."
" Accurate and moving portrayal of history
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"My grandparents often spoke of their childhood in Armenia – the soft rolling mountains, the lush greenery, the magical cities where western and eastern cultures merged. And then how it came to a screeching halt as their lives were ripped away. It never made sense to me. But last night their world unfolded before my eyes. The acting, the scenery, the effort to accurately portray history. Thank you Kirk Kerkorian – for telling the world our story and for taking it one step further and donating the proceeds to charity --- unprecedented!"
" Eye opening - true historical event - must see!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Everyone must see this movie. It was so well done, portraying a terrible time in history, that the whole world should know know about. It will open your eyes to truth in history. ""The best revenge is to survive!"" This is not political, it is about a true event in history that has been hidden and hush-hushed all these years. It DID happen and the world needs to know about it."
" Excellent movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,Wonderful movie. Has a dramatic story which will keep you on the edge of your seat with never ending twists and turns. The sad part is that this is a true story that thousands of people went through. It is difficult to imagine the strength and courage of people that went through this and how they survived some of them. Cannot say too much without ruining the movie. All I can say is that after you see this movie you will be forever changed. This is a must see for all. One of the best films I have seen . Highly recommend this movie if you want to know about history and see great acting at the same time.
" Powerful and Gripping
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"The Promise is a powerful and based on the true events of the Armenian Genocide in 1915 that was perpetrated by the Turkish Government against the Armenian people. They were forced out of their homes, many killed and by the grace of God some survived to tell their story. Everyone should see this movie. Hilter felt compelled to round up and kill the Jewish people because in his eyes no one remembered or cared about the Armenians. Well, we Armenians are still here today to tell the story of our family members. Whether you are Armenian or not it behooves everyone to see this story and remember that people who are escaping terror are human beings who want what we all want peace, dignity, and love. Please see The Promise. I promise you will come out of the theater wiser and better for it. I thank all those who brought this movie and it's message to the screen especially Kirk Krikorian whose vision has now been realized."
" Excellent Movie
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Some might say I am biased but I did invite 3 other friends who were not really familiar with the details of the Armenian Genocide committed by the Ottoman Empire during WWI in 1915. After we saw the movie I asked them how did they like it? They were all very happy that they saw it. Not only because it was beautifully done but they were really engaged and learned something new that they said they had not paid enough attention too. This was besides the cinematography and well balanced romance vs history and a lesson of untold Genocide kept in dark and silenced for more than 100 years. It is an embarrassing era for current Turkish government and of course they deny with every political tool they have this truth. But you can google it yourselves, visit historical archives of USA museums and Europe, Even Germany's archives which were kept secret for many years because they were Turkey's ally during WWI have been recently made public which detail This first Genocide of the 20th century which became the blueprint of Hitler's killings and the Jewish Holocaust. Hitler himself said during WWII when asked how he will explain his orders for killing Jews, he answered:""Who remembers the Armenian Genocide of 1.5 million Armenians?"" And went on to kill more than 7 million Jews. So go ahead deny the history and look the other way especially now when the world is so tense and whispers of war is all around in Asian continent, and see if you can stop the next Genocide from happening, without learning from history. So yes it is important to me as it should be to any decent human being to accept that history does have dark chapters and pages but ripping those pages out of the books and attempting to keep people in the dark only harms all of humanity. I strongly suggest to see this movie not only because it is beautifully done and acted but because its historic value and lesson. Then come here and write couple lines about your honest thoughts. Thank you."
" best movie of the year
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"William Saroyan ""I should like to see any power of the world destroy this race, this small tribe of unimportant people, whose wars have all been fought and lost, whose structures have crumbled, literature is unread, music is unheard, and prayers are no more answered. Go ahead, destroy Armenia . See if you can do it. Send them into the desert without bread or water. Burn their homes and churches. Then see if they will not laugh, sing and pray again. For when two of them meet anywhere in the world, see if they will not create a New Armenia. Mr President, recognize the Armenian genocide and not ignore it like the last presidents before Don't make us make another sign with your name on it! If you don't recognize the genocide there will be more Christian genocides on the way,"
" Great Movie a must see for all
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,This movie tells a story that needs to be told. It's well done and has a strong impact to the viewer. It's based on a love story but the underlying story has never been told before about the Armenian Genocide. I recommend you see it and also bring your children if over 13 years old. It's amazing how many non Armenians don't know about the Genocide.
" Excellent Movie Go and See It
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Hi I loved ""the Promise"". You should go and see it. its a love story and drama. Its what happened on Ottoman Turkey to the Armenians.There are lessons to be learnt for all of us as humans living in this lovely planet earth.I really enjoyed the store and the action too.Go and see it."
" Great Movie with Great Cast
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Just watched ""The Promise"", few hours ago. It is a great movie and I highly recommend you to watch this film if you are a fan of drama specially historical drama. Please ignore the 1 star ratings since they are not real reviews. They are made by Turkish people/government (most of them even before release of the movie) as part of their long term denial policy in regards to the Armenian Genocide committed by ottoman turks."
" The Truth Must Be Told!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"The fact that so many people are already coming out and denying this movie before they have even seen it will have the reverse effect of what they are trying to achieve. I have a few Armenian friends and what was done to their families is just as bad as what the Nazis did to the Jews. With all the fake and biased news of today, it is essential to do your own research and fact check for yourself before you put your voice behind something. Even though I have not seen the movie yet, I would encourage you to go see it and decide for yourself."
" A Wonderful Film
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"""The Promise"" is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It was incredibly moving and I would encourage everyone to go and watch it. For me to explain how deeply personal this movie is to me would be impossible, however I want to stress that the importance of this film is bigger than my personal feelings about the Armenian Genocide or the pride that I feel for being Armenian. If I could pretend for a moment that I wasn't Armenian, and be completely objective about the film, I would still think that it was a very good film. However, my family history, personal experiences, and my knowledge about Armenian history and culture only support why this film is so good. The film is incredibly historically and culturally accurate, and while the main characters are fictional, their story was not far fetched. The film was incredibly heart wrenching, and difficult to watch as an Armenian, and a human being; but it was well worth the emotional journey. If you care to learn about one of the lesser known but significant stories of history, I would recommend this film, as it accurately sums up the events that took place in Turkey at the turn of the 20th century. I believe that everyone should watch ""The Promise"", because it honors the lives of the 1.5 Million innocent Greek, Assyrian, and Armenian civilians who lost their lives during the duration of World War I. The genocide is not widely known about in the United States largely because of our government's ""quiet policy"" on the issue. It is because of Turkey's NATO alliance and its geopolitical significance in the Middle East. It is because Turkey's government denies the genocide to this day, and threatens to sever its ties with the United States if they officially recognize it. However, the truth shall always prevail and this film finally tells the story of the Armenian people to an American audience and it is one of the most beautiful artistic expressions that I have ever witnessed. My final rating is a 10/10. Please go see ""The Promise"", and tell everyone about it. I promise you won't regret it. #keepthepromise"
" Great movie to watch! Impressed!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"""The Promise"" – an amazing movie that combines so much in its plot. What impressed me a lot in the movie is that the whole story is a love story along with historical tragedy of Armenian genocide. We see that despite all the hardships of life, a human nature still made people love, build strong friendship, dream big of achieving their career goals and, most importantly, giving promises. The main promise of the movie is the promise to survive. However, what I found fascinating about this movie is that the main character Mikael Boghosian really keeps every promise he makes. He promised to marry a young woman Maral, who was waiting for him, and despite the fact that he fell in love with another lady, he still stayed honest to his original promise. Also, we see that even though Turkish and Armenian people were enemies, there are still great people in every culture. The example of it would be a Turkish friend of Michael, who helped him so many times. That's another promise – a promise of being a good friend despite the politics and opinions of people around. The Promise is a movie that shows a general idea of suffering Armenian people went through during those days of genocide. Armenia is a small country and Armenians are spread throughout the world. However, this nation has one thing in common and this is the tragedy of the genocide this nation went through. I can go on and on talking about this movie, but the main thing is that I am very proud of people who contributed a lot of hard work in creation of such a movie. May this movie be a good lesson for all of us to know that no matter what happens in life, we never have to forget how to respect our families, ancestors, we should never be afraid of falling in love, building friendship and keeping the promise of fighting for life. Life is a gift and we have to keep the promise to keep it! #ThePromise #ArmenianGenocide"
" An Outstanding Film
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,The Promise was an outstanding film that captures the true story of the Armenian Genocide while presenting a dramatic love story. The history of the Armenian people has been brilliantly presented while continuously captivating the audience to evoke emotion. I would definitely recommend this successful film to any movie lover because it is truly unique and appeals to various audiences.
" Bravo
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,I am so proud of this film. This film took an extremely long time to be made. It's such an important part of Armenian history that isn't taught outside of Armenian schools. Nobody would know about the history that took place and the fact that it was truly a Genocide. The systematic massacres and attempt at annihilating a people are retold in this phenomenal film. I am so proud to be Armenian and I am so proud of the filmmakers and all the people that made this movie happen. Please see this important piece of Armenian history and learn about the horrors of the past so we do not repeat it ever again.
" Great movie
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie. Very entertaining on many levels. It revealed the untold story of the Armenian Genocide, a tragic plight against a persevering nation. The scenery, acting, story lines and historical context made it an extremely enjoyable movie to watch. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in World War I history."
" Love story, compassion of non-Armenians and the terrors towards Armenians..
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I watched the movie last night. I'm Armenian and my review may seem biased to many of you...However, I tried to be objective and explain why I love this movie. Right from the beginning of the movie you immerse in the Armenian culture and follow the life of an aspiring medical student..I like the whole idea of love story since it is something that many non- Armenians will appreciate watching the movie..It's well-written and professionally played by the actors. Thank you to the crew of the movie for showing good examples from Turkish side as well..When a Turkish young man is not afraid to go against the system and saves his Armenian friends...This illustrates the natural friendliness and mutual respect among progressive, educated and open-minded people regardless of ethnicity and religion. The killings of Armenians and their fearless attempts to resist the Ottoman soldiers..The tragedy and the pain are felt everywhere...They kept the promise...They SURVIVED! I highly recommend everyone (especially, non-Armenians) to watch this movie..You won't be disappointed!"
" Powerful, stirring and thought provoking!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Just saw the film on its opening night in the US (4-21). It is a very powerful, stirring and thought provoking film filled with a lot of emotion. The actors, writers, directors and producers genuinely deserve the accolades that will come for accepting the challenge to tell these events of the early 20th century that can only be described as man's inhumanity to his fellow man. The massacres of the ethnic Christian minorities and particularly the Armenians by the Ottoman rulers shocked the sensibilities of the civilized peoples. Thanks to reporters and missionaries events depicted in the film were reported almost daily in the New York Times. Foreign correspondents like Chris Meyers (Christian Bale) were the eyes to the world exposing a government slaughtering its own citizens in an ethnic cleansing. It is a must see! But come prepared.I doubt there was a dry eye in our packed theater! ""Keep the Promise!"""
" The Promise a very special film
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"The Promise keeps it's word. It is a wonderful film. It's a lovely story line built into historically accurate facts with such authenticity. I was amazed at the accuracy of the information provided, yet the story line and manner of handling horrors beyond imagination, was very well done.The movie softens it all.I wondered if it was too soft but realized that a brief snippet of what happened was enough. There was an event that occurred that took place in 40 days and yet in the film it appeared to be only 2 or 3 days, but I guess it would be herd to portray that.The acting was superb, and it's hard to pick who I though played it the best. Wonderful actors and a delightful cameo from one of my favorites, Jean Remo.Go see this movie."
" A must watch movie
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I watched ""The Promise"" today. It is an amazing film. It absolutely deserves to rate much higher. I highly recommend you to watch this film . Their story is so beautiful and emotional. Please ignore the 1 star ratings since they are not real reviews. These reviews are here because Turkey can't tolerate the release of this film."
" An outstanding performance by everyone
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"What a great movie, great cast and a wonderful love story. The directing and acting was outstanding and it depicted a sad period during the Armenian history. One of my favorite food this year. A story that had to be shared with the world, despite of all deniers of the Armenian Genocide. And what was even more appealing is that it had a beautiful story linked to it, and events in locations that actually occurred. Oscar Issac and Christian Bale did an amazing job, and Charlotte Le Bon was very convincing as an Armenian. Angela Safarian was very charming with her village girl looks. Terry George did it once again, an amazing job directing the movie and telling a story the way it should be told. Thanks for a wonderful movie."
" A solid film dealing with an important topic.
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"If you have critiques of this film that are less than good to excellent, then please keep them about the filmmaking. It seems many have lambasted this film without having seen it themselves. Is it perfect? No. Is it important? Yes. It is well shot and puts a human face to a major atrocity in human history. Of course there are some flaws and the plot between the main characters could have been moved along a little better, but it is at the end, dealing in serious issues that need to be heard. Go see it, before you make up your mind."
" Amazing movie and shame on what I found out!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"AMAZING movie. The actors played their roles very well. The way the movie was filmed, amazing. The scenes, wonderful. This movie really touched me. Very well done. There are a lot of great Armenian survival stories during the genocide and even before Christ. I hope more amazing movies come out. Best line was, ""our revenge is to survive."". Just WOW!One final thing I want to add. We went with a large group of people to watch the movie during the opening and unfortunately the movie was sold out. I was lucky to get a ticket. And most of my friends went home and came for nothing. When I went into the theater, the room was 75% full. After the movie, I went and asked what the hell happened. They told me that someone reserved for 125 people and they never showed up and got refunded. Whoever is doing this (I'm assuming the turks, who else?), have really nothing else to do. So if you see that the movie is sold out, go and check for yourself. I'm sure they're doing this everywhere. The location that this happened is in Laval, Quebec, Canada at a Famous Players theater."
" Beautiful and moving, despite the forced script
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,9,"Despite the handful of heavy handed lines referring to historical events in Armenia since 1914, the filming is beautiful, the actors are wonderful, and the story is touching and believable. Quite a cast of veteran actors! It's unfortunate that a Guatemalan is playing an Armenian, but Oscar Isaac is a very good actor - I was quite moved by a few scenes he nailed emotionally. I'm sure there will be plenty of criticism around the roles of the U.S., Turkey and Germany. I don't think the political mishmash is enough reason to skip this movie - it has stuck with me these past few days,and to me that is a sign of good entertainment."
" A Must See!!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Heart-breaking, beautifully made, a must-see. A tragic but extremely important part of history. This film tells the story of what happened to the Armenians during the final days of the Ottoman Empire at the hands of the Ottoman Turks. There is a love story, but it is not cheesy. The acting is superb. You will not leave the theater with dry eyes, but you will have learned more about this very significant part of history. Very relevant to what is going on today. Go see The Promise!!!"
" Beautiful movie - A Must See!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Everyone should see this movie - it's a must see. It portray a very dark patch in the history of the world, that the world should know about. The cast is amazing - the movie shows the events that took place during the Armenian genocide. It doesn't show that much violence, but, you connect to the characters, you feel for the people, and you feel their pain."
" A masterpiece, everyone must see!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I just watched this masterpiece of Terry George, a powerful and moving film shedding light on a horrible crime against humanity that occurred a century ago in the Ottoman Empire. A big thanks to everyone who contributed to the realization of this epic movie, what you have accomplished will be remembered for generations to come and will help prevent future genocides. I recommend everyone to go and see this movie this weekend, and please don't forget to rate it. All proceeds will be donated to non-profit organizations."
" Great Movie
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I saw the movie today it did amazing.1915 Never Again!! With out history there is no future. Without knowledge of the past there is no future. If we don't recognize the Armenian genocide then there will be more genocides.We should recognize the Armenian Genocide because 1.5 million people died, killed, murdered by the Turks. The Turks made Armenians move away from there village which was not fair. If you don't learn from your history, you're destined to repeat it. All we want is Turkey to say yes we killed 1.5 million of Armenians and it happened but they refuse. You can not rate a movie that has not even come out yet, you rate a movie after you watch it."
" Must Watch!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,Watching this my heart broke into a million pieces! But I also want to watch it over and over. The film was beautifully done. The writers and director have taken the tragic history of the Armenians and have shared the story in a remarkable way; allowing for viewers of all ages to watch and learn from. Great cast! Empowering film! A definite must watch!
" A necessary movie!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,9,"Finally, Hollywood has made a movie about the Armenian Genocide. They released it on the weekend commemorating this atrocity. Perfect timing. As a non-Armenian who has visited Turkey, this historical movie should be seen by all peoples. Only 20 years after the Armenian Genocide did the Holocaust in Europe begin. Our children need to learn the lessons of the past to prevent more Holocausts in the future. This movie helps to achieve this goal, framed within a love story. A must see!"
" Good movie. Polarizing as some refuse to accept truth.
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Christian Bale is great in this. It is amazing that they are donating all of the proceeds to charity. Most civilized countries have accepted the mass murder and displacement of the Armenian people at the hands of the Turkish (Canada has recognized the genocide in 2004). Unfortunately many of those in Turkey not only have refused to acknowledge this but have reacted angrily to statements of fact, such as this movie (as you can see from some of the reviews). Turkey is a valuable NATO ally but it is irrational and causing more resentment and damage to deny the harm done to the Armenian people. Please just accept it so the reconciliation and healing can finally begin as we all need to devote our energy towards, and stand together against, the real current threats facing the entire civilized world these days."
" Great movie, will watch it again for sure
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie so much. It was so interesting, I didn't want it to end. It demonstrates the truth of how Armenian Genocide did happen. It also has a great love story that made the movie even more incredible. The cast has been picked perfectly. They all play their role amazing. I want to go watch it again, that's how great it was!"
" Incredible
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"**May Contain Spoilers**Incredible movie with an interesting plot to captivate the audience in an otherwise emotionally heavy setting. This film did an incredible job at depicting a glimpse of what the Armenian Genocide was and what it did to the Armenian people, their culture, their homes, their families...etc. I highly encourage you to see the film so that you are made aware of history and to educate yourself on how to boycott similar atrocities going on in modern-day."
" Great Movie
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"This was a great movie with a very important story to tell. I learned a lot about the Armenian Genocide from this movie, and I'm glad that others will have the opportunity to learn as well. The scenery is beautiful. Oscar Isaac gives a great performance as Michael. Please disregard the majority of negative reviews given on this site; Armenian Genocide deniers have decided to target this movie by writing terrible reviews. See this movie!"
" Best movie I have ever seen.
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I cried three or four times. Gomidas CHURCH music scenes slayed me. SHAME on the Turks who gave this one star. THIS was a 10 star film. Flawless, and appropriate for age 9 and up.The music of the Armenian Church, the friendly Turks, and the heroine and martyrs, OMG what a great film. Take a friend!"
" Seeing it again
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"A wonderful performance from Christian Bale, Oscar Isaac, and Charlotte Le Bon. Terry George did a great job directing and writing this movie. This beautiful romance during the Armenian Genocide, a worth while movie. It is the first time I sat in a fully packed theater with viewers sitting in utter silence, and majority of them drying their tears from their face. I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews that I'm reading. I'm assuming that because of all the politics around the Armenian Genocide it's causing some anger amongst some groups of people. It's also great, no gory details of slaughters, and rapes. No nudity. Truly an amazing movie."
" Amazing Movie!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I just came back from seeing this movie with my sister. I rarely go see movies and have never written a movies review but I felt compelled to write it for this movie. Oscar Isaac's acting was heartfelt. Christian Bale & Charlotte Le Bon along with the rest of the cast made the story come to life. I never for a second become bored or frustrated watching this & hoping it to be over. It was full of suspense, it had a beautiful love story, death, betrayal, hope & the best part is that it is a true story. This movie portrays the reality of what transpired in the early 1900's with the genocide of the Armenian people! This also applies to the Greeks & Syrians! DON'T BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS& GO WATCH IT!"
" Movie of the year
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,All I can say about this movie is WOW! Just got out of the theatre and had to leave a review it is absolutely magnificent the drama the romance the history... Oscar Worthy and worth 5 stars. It shows that their has been a lot of maticuloise work with a lot of planning to hit the emotional component and display the historical context with out losing the back bone of the story.
" incredible movie
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"finally! The Promise, starring Christian Bale and Oscar Isaac. The $100 million movie is projected to earn $1.5 million-$2 million Friday from 2,251 theaters for a $4 million-$5 million launch. (One rival studio shows the movie coming in much higher at $10 million, but that's still a sobering start considering the movie's hefty budget.)The Promise was fully financed by the late Kirk Kerkorian, who was of Armenian descent. It is the first major U.S. film to address the genocide of Armenians during the waning days of the Ottoman Empire."
" Best movie that I have seen in a long time, great drama and music! Profits go to charity!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Five of us saw this amazing, epic film last night and we all agreed that it was an excellent and moving film. The story and actors are captivating with lots of suspense. The story is set at the beginning of WWI, depicting historically accurate events without showing a lot of blood and gore. This story has it all, love, friendship, betrayal, death, and survival. You will be moved by this story long after you leave the theater. All profits from this film go to various charities!! Bravo!!!"
" Masterful film
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Don't believe the ratings or the reviews! I've long been interested in the Armenian Genocide and was looking forward to seeing the first major film on the subject. I was expecting at least a halfway decent work, considering all the talent involved. What a surprise! This is a great film, masterful in all respects: script, acting, cinematography, music, etc. Very powerful and very moving. I can't recommend it highly enough."
" Fantastic movie. Very accurate, historically. Great plot
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Fantastic movie. Very accurate, historically. The whole love triangle was very intriguing and kept me engaged in the movie the whole time. The plot hit very close to home in that I am Armenian, and all that aside, it was still an outstanding film. Great acting by Oscar Isaac, who apparently learned some Armenian, which was also pretty nice as well. Great that the Armenian Genocide was finally displayed on a national/ international level, and although there is an insane amount of lobbying on the Turkish end for the movie to not do well, it was still an amazing movie."
" A movie that shows the lives of the many Armenians who faced tragedy, hope, and survival.
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie changed my life. I used to not care about the Armenian Genocide as much as last time, but when I saw this film, my eyes went ka-boom! This movie is a really interesting, suspenseful, emotional, and very truthful movie. If you want to know what really happened to the Armenians, you MUST WATCH THIS FILM!!"
" Fantastic
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,9,"A wonderful effort from director Terry George & the entire cast. This film is the first legitimate movie to tell the story of the Armenian Genocide that will appeal to not only the Armenian people, but also regular moviegoers who for the most part have no idea that this historic atrocity actually took place. Is it perfect? No, but a emotional experience not to be missed. Tell your friends. A 100% of the proceeds of this film goes to charity so it's a win, win."
" False reports on IMDb.
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"How can there be 123,000 votes for a film that hasn't even opened in US or UK until today? Over 50K low scores. It leads one to believe this is rigged and set-up to deceive those who are here to read valid reviews. Allowing this type of voting does not do any service to the credibility of IMDb. I saw the film today and found it to be excellent: history, love story, human and the social impact of it. I didn't know anything about the early 20th century Ottoman murders of Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians. Powerful film..."
" Very good movie, excellent acting and story
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"The movie was well written and acted, it was an accurate representation of the issues facing Armenians under the Ottoman massacre's. It is a good thing this movie has brought the truth to many whom did not know of the Armenian genocide and many of the scenes depicted were events that actually happened . It was a first rate production, I recommend all to see it."
" Important movie to see
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"While I thought the love story was a little weak, the important story in this film is the Armenian Genocide. Long denied, long ignored, most of my non-Armenian friends know little to nothing about this first genocide of the 20th century. I felt the movie portrayed man's inhumanity to man juxtaposed with man's compassion, loyalty, courage and help for those being oppressed. Many of the scenes could have been taken directly from my own grandparents memoirs. I appreciate that, while there are some graphic scenes,the story was told without a ton of blood and guts...it was enough to touch and move the soul but not enough to make one ill. So, while the love story was a little weak and predictable, it was a good foil for the bigger message, which is that 1.5 million Armenians were displaced, murdered in an effort by the Young Turks to wipe them off the face of the earth. Why does it matter? It matters to descendants of survivors to have their families horrors acknowledged. It should matter to all of us because if we don't acknowledge what evil we humans are prone to, what havoc and pain hatred can wreak, we are destined to turn a blind eye or even participate in repeating it. See it for yourself. DOn't believe the reviews of people who rated this movies months before the film was even released."
" Memorable and very emotional, one of the best depictions of the Genocide.
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,This movie will earn your respect by educating you about what happened in history and how the truth has been hidden from the world because of political and economic interests.This movie does a great job helping raise awareness about the Armenian genocide. Every country owes it to Armenians to help set the record straight.
" Amazing film
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Amazing movie! Very accurate depiction of the real events that occurred during the Armenian Genocide. Though no amount of the pain and suffering of a genocide, which the Armenians went through and are still going through, can be captured in a film, The Promise does come very close."
" Best presentation in a relatively short movie
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,9,"This movie was every bit as accurate as my father told me who was orphaned during the Genocide of the Armenians of course minus the love triangle. A nightmare he lived for the most part of his life, I was not immune of the pain. The sad part is that relatively few people knew/know of the atrocities and most of the survivors have died since. In some ways Hitler was right when he said ""after all who remembers the Armenians."" The race survived so did the pain of losing the loved ones, and the ancestral land. Forgiveness comes when there's admission. A century later the saga continues in a country where dictators thrive."
" excellent movie
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,Very moving story describing a sad tragedy.Reminded me of Dr Zhivago movie.The Promise is an excellent movie to see.The characters are well developed.The story is that of a love triangle happening against the background of the first genocide of the 20th century.Although the horrors are felt throughout the movie there are no violent scenes which would make it uncomfortable to watch.Christian Bale and Oscar Isaacs are great.I watched their interview on CBS where they explained that this was the only movie that 100% of the proceeds go to charities.So by seeing this movie you would have contibuted to charities too!
" Tell ALL your friends
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Tell all your friends to watch and come rate.SUPERB, wonderful movie.Brilliantly acted, filmed, written.Oscar-worthy with powerhouses in the lead.DO NOT miss this one. It really can't be done any better."
" Amazing movie
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Just watched it, amazing.must watch and learn about history.I will watch it again for sure. cant wait.A movie that shows that the worked hard for it. Amazing actor and actress. Perfect love story and great pictures. def a Oscar worthy.everybody should go and watch it. Armenian genocide was existed and we believe that one day every body will agree with it."
" Two thumbs up!!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,9,"The trailer looked interesting, so I went to see the movie. I was pleasantly surprised of the cast and the set. It really did capture the times, gave us important part of human history while following a love triangle. It was beautifully done and if you are a sucker for a good love story with little bit of true history thrown with it, I recommend you go watch this film."
" This movie is much better than a 5/10!!!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"My 1st ever review. I felt compelled to write because of the bad rating which almost made me skip seeing this movie. I have no horse in this race. I just like a good story to go along with a good movie. This movie tells the true story of Turkey committing an atrocity. The truth hurts, Turkey just can't admit it. In my opinion, that is what seems to be behind the bad rating. THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE!!! I am glad I took a chance to see for myself. I was definitely rewarded."
" The Promise was a gripping tale of survival
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,9,"Just saw the Promise today. I was not excited by a 2 hour long romance - however this movie was not really some love story as much as it was a gripping story of survival. This was way better than one of those mountain climbers fighting to get up a mountain or astronauts trying to get back to earth. I think it was better because I really connected with the characters, thanks to the great acting and a really compelling script. By the end of the movie, I didn't even think I had been in the theater for 2 hours -seemed to pass quickly. The subject is sad, but the movie was not graphic. It reminds us that people come to the USA from all kinds of difficult situations. I highly recommend this little gem of a movie."
" Must watch
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I'm really not a movie goer, but being Armenian, I had to see this to see if they were historically accurate or if Hollywood creative licence would disappoint me. Putting my Armenian bias to one side (as much as possible), all I can say is WOW!For anyone that wants to know the truth of what happened to the Armenian people at the hands of Talaat Pasha and his Committee of Union and Progress (C.U.P.), go see this movie. Thank you to everyone who made The Promise a reality. You have done right by the Armenian people and humanity!"
" Support The Promise; Let the Truth be Known
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"As a grandchild of an Armenian genocide survivor, it was an emotional and proud moment to know that my grandparents suffering was not in vain. They survived these atrocities at the hands of the Turkish government. And now we live on to tell their story. This film is an actual portrayal of what was happening to the Armenian people during the ottoman regime and the organizations that were trying to assist and let the world know. The cast so aptly tells every story right down to the Turkish denial and lies. it's about time a movie such as this was made to let the world know and to make people aware that this is still happening in modern day. We need a humanitarian awakening and The Promise does this superbly."
" Beautiful love story set against accurate, tragic history
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie. The characters are still with me, and I find myself thinking about them and what it was like for them. It is beautiful, poignant, sad, and inspiring. It is also the story of my family, very few of whom survived the genocide. The historical aspect is absolutely accurate, and the love story is beautiful."
" Excellent movie
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Just got back from seeing The Promise in Livonia, MI. I have to say I didn't think it was going to be that good, but it exceeded my expectations. This is a must see. From what I got out of it is that Mikael, main character, makes two promises and keeps them both. After seeing the death marches, it brought back memories of the stories our grandparents told us. I left in tears."
" The Promise has the potential to change and spread the truth
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I am an Armenian and as of yet I haven't even commented on the movie ""The Promise"", since I haven't seen it yet. But, today I am going to give it a 10 to make sure i give the movie a little better appeal. Turks and possibly Azeris are flucking here like the Turkic nomads of Central Asia to plunder everything that doesn't agree with their nationalistic ego and greed. Main reason The Promise is getting low overall reviews is because of the fear the deniers have to come here and counter act the process. History has evidence and the first thing that leads one to get curious about the Armenians comes before the knowledge of the genocide and it is the ""The Armenian Diaspora"". From there the evidence gets stronger. Even the US ambassador to Turkey at the time spoke of Ottoman's intention to eliminate a whole race.Given that at least half of Turkey are nationalist and follow their dictator with heart and soul is prove that they will do anything to make the truth about the Armenian genocide look fake. But, its not only about the Armenian genocide, the events of 1915 started a stlaughter of Christians that resulted in more than 4 million death. Calling The Promise useless and waste is a prove how much energy deniers waste on believing what they are brain washed for. And the only reason anyone supports Turkey on the lie they try to spread is the fact that Turkey is a major strategic member of NATO."
" An excellent & accurate portrayal of the Armenian Genocide committed by the {Ottoman}Turkish Government
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I actually have SEEN this movie {unlike so many other reviewers who have posted unfavorable ratings in an attempt to discredit the film and/or discourage people from seeing it and deciding for themselves}.I am a descendant of victims, and a grandchild of SURVIVORS, of the Armenian Genocide committed by the Ottoman Turkish Government under cover of World War I, and actively, consistently denied by the governments of the current ""Republic"" of Turkey for the 100 years which have followed since the premeditated crime. Respected and credentialed historians worldwide -- both Armenian and non-Armenian -- have provided ample documentation -- including telegrams from Turkish Government leaders ordering the extermination of its Armenian population -- that this was GENOCIDE -- killing over 1.5 million people -- and the first of the 20th Century.While some people may despair the inclusion of a ""romantic love triangle"", I believe that doing so helps to personalize/humanize and provide a manageable basis for understanding the various horrific atrocities which were experienced by men (including clergy), women, and children (including unborn children who were cut out from their mothers' wombs). And by not graphically portraying these atrocities, the makers of the movie have made it feasible for it to be viewed by millions of young students so they can become informed/educated about this terrible chapter of the world's history and, thus, hopefully help to prevent recurrences of such genocides. I applaud the screenwriter, cast, crew, & director; and special appreciation for the late, great entrepreneur & philanthropist Mr. Kirk Kerkorian who self-financed the movie.I sincerely encourage people, especially non-Armenians who know nothing or very little about this subject to make every effort to see and ""judge"" this movie for themselves. Armenians will find it an important cathartic experience. *** NOTE: All proceeds from the movie will go to charitable organizations around the world."
" A Must Watch
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Saw This Movie Last Night With My Girlfirend (Not Armenian) With A Theater Filled With Non Armenians; as Well as Armenians (The Reason I Say This is For There Were IMDb Users Who Gave This Movie A ""Bad Rating"" Before the Fill Even Came Out). Those Who Actually Watched This Movie, Know That This Movie Is Extraordinary and Just The Cinematography and Acting Alone Made It Outstanding; And To Add Upon With The Love Triangle, The Intensity, The Drama, And Its True Story of The Events That Took Place in History as Well as Its Significance Today Made This Movie Unforgettable and Amazing. In Short, This Movie Drew Myself, My Girlfriend, and The Auidiences Attention, Put Us At the Edge of Our Seats, Took Our Breath Away, and Accomplished Its Main Purpose; Which was Educating Us All. Must Watch"
" The Promise delivers on all levels!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Wow what a movie just wonderful. An accurate account of history that some deny. A love story that is touching, emotional, and unforgettable! A must see and Oscar worthy from acting, directing, producing and more. Oscar Isaac is fantastic and should be awarded for his flawless acting. I will definitely see this movie again soon."
" Excellent film
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,This is a magnificent film. Deeply moving. I highly recommend it. It's based on historical facts about a genocide that is hardly spoken about. The actors were brilliant. It was hard for me to watch as an Armenian who lost many relatives in this largely unacknowledged crime. But I'm glad I went to see it. I recommend it.
" Must see movie
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,Excellent movie. I left in tears. It is a poignant love story with the beginnings of a tragedy to annihilate the Armenian people. I found that Mikael made promises that he honored to keep and he did. I didn't expect this movie to be good but it exceeded my expectations. It brought back memories of the stories my grandparents told us of how they persevered during the dead marches. We will never forget. Oscar Isaac did a phenomenal job as did all the other actors. Please do yourself a favor and see this movie.
" 10
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"It's a very nice and true, hope to look full movie in this nearest days. Thank's to all people who have done a big work for producing this film. Special thank's to Christian Bale!Sooner or later truth about Armenian genocide will win, God is with the victims of this horror."
" Captivating, Surprising, Edge-of-Your-Seat History
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,9,"THE PROMISE is a surprisingly fascinating, epic depiction of Turkey's genocide against Armenian Christians in 1914-15. Mikhail leaves his bride to be in their small village to attend medical school in Constantinople. In Constantinople, Mikhail falls in love with Ana, the beautiful tutor of his uncle's children, and she with him. However, Ana is already having an affair with an American journalist, Chris Myers, from the Associated Press. As they start to get to acquainted, Turkey aligns with Germany and undertakes to kill off all the non-Muslims aka infidels, including the Armenian Christians. Can anyone survive? Can promises be kept? THE PROMISE is a very powerful, exciting historical epic. It keeps surprising the audience with new twists, turns and intensified jeopardy. THE PROMISE is full of action movie violence. The bedroom scene diminishes the Christian commitment of the two featured Armenian characters, as does the woman's affair with the American reporter. That said, the movie's positive Christian aspects are overt, pervasive and spot on. In the end, Christian heroism and nobility prevail despite the terrible genocide committed by Muslims in Turkey, whose Muslim past is filled with horrific examples of brutality and murder, via the morally corrupt Ottoman Empire, against Non-Muslims, especially Christians and Jews, from Turkey to the Middle East, Southeastern Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. THE PROMISE elicits compassion, emotion, tears, joy, and ultimately victory."
" A Historical injustice brought to light though a story written in love and humanity
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"A love story set during a dark time in history, where the Genocide of Armenian people is fought against by bravery and humanity from all sides involved. Great film, Christian Bale at his finest. Director Terry George, once again, is able to illustrate the evils of genocide and ,some how, instill a message of hope. Must see."
" This movie is a MUST SEE! Armenian history, love story, great acting.
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,9,"""The Promise"" is a movie that tells the Armenian story, of the sacrifice, the bloodshed and the many lives lost through the horrific Genocide over 100 years ago. This was a magnificent production with breathtaking scenery and excellent actors. It revolved around an interesting love triangle. Michael, Ana and Christopher - 3 strong, caring individuals. My eyes never left the screen! The background music was soft and subtle where it needed to be. And when it got loud or built up during nerve rattling, frightening action sequences, I sat ever so still on the edge of my seat. I was lifted up into each specific moment on the screen, whereby I felt the emotion. Oscar Isaac was phenomenal as Michael. He totally immersed himself into his role. I was drawn in to every word that he spoke. His eyes showed so much feeling, love, and compassion. His reaction upon seeing his murdered father and butchered pregnant wife by the water's edge oozed with his heartbreak and pain. His actions and his eyes expressed it all; there were tears and sobbing. Movie watchers could feel his terrible loss. It was very moving! This is a movie that EVERYONE can enjoy and should see, but not just Armenians. Yes, because it's a true story of our people. Also, for the spectacular and powerful film that it is. Entertainment at its finest! Thank you to Kirk Kerkorian for making this movie possible!!"
" A worthy movie for shedding light on real events from the past, as well as its focus on ordinary people in extraordinary times and their relationships with one another.
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"The Promise is a romantic drama taking place during the Armenian Genocide. Unlike most romantic dramas, the theater experience adds value to this movie. The following is my personal reaction to the movie, as well as my best attempt at an unbiased review.The movie touched a deep nerve in me, moving me to extreme emotions of sorrow, pride, disgust, joy, shame, love, disdain, admiration, regret, and hope. Still swimming in a cacophony of emotions, I appreciate having a major motion picture represent a defining moment in the history of a nation not usually in the spotlight.The movie did an excellent job of capturing some of the key events, aspects, and atmosphere of the Armenian Genocide as the backdrop of a Dickesnsian story of an Armenian medical student during the final days of the Ottoman Empire. The production quality is quite high, with beautiful cinematography, sound and effects. The setting is gorgeously reproduced and the historical and cultural elements feel authentic. At times, the movie seems lacking in nuance, perhaps because it attempts too much. There were a couple of scenes that felt contrived, merely to complete the painting of the broad picture of the Genocide backdrop. I appreciate that the story of the Armenian Genocide needs telling, and connoisseurs of history will be forgiving and grateful. However, I can see how attempting to cover so many facets of the events of the time make it more difficult to weave a tight and coherent story and might not go over as well for general audiences.On the positive side, the acting on the part of the main leads was quite excellent. Christian Bale, in particular, was great as a troubled, yet heroic, American journalist. The remaining primary characters, especially Oscar Isaac and Charlotte Le Bon were also quite effective and affecting. I associated strongly with all three of these characters, empathizing with the agony and humanity of their sometimes difficult choices and actions. As the importance of the characters decreased, so did their depth and quality. This, again, was a side effect of trying to cover too much ground and being forced to forgo proper character development.An important feature of the story was portrayed through the Turkish medical student, played by Marwan Kenzari. Kenzari's character development and representation on screen was superior to many of the other (especially other Turkish) secondary characters. I believe that this character's interactions and connection with the movie's primary characters is the model of what relations between people, regardless of race or heritage, has always been during the best of times and what it should be at all times.In conclusion, the movie is a must see for anyone interested in the Armenian Genocide, as well as anyone interested in the relationship between people and peoples. This movie will not be easy to watch or provide a happy escape for a couple of hours. It will, however, provide insight into the complexity of the human animal: An animal that can be so majestic, creative, and caring, as well as so cruel, destructive, and vulgar; a being that can appreciate and produce so much beauty, but can also loose itself to greed and mindless fervor and violence. See The Promise on the eve of the 102nd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, understand the dark past, reflect on our inner humanity, and resolve to vanquish darkness by shedding light on the beauty of our existence."
" Must see!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"Saw the movie at an advanced screening and found it very moving. Bravo Terry George, Oscar Isaac, and Christian Bale. You beautifully gave a voice to a story that needed to be told. Standing ovation to composer Gabriel Yared. I have been anxiously waiting to see this movie since its premiere at the Toronto Film Festival -- the wait was worth it."
" Don't believe the poor reviews & see it for yourself - I did !!!
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"I wanted to see why this movie was getting such poor ratings from your site . I saw it last night 4/20/2017 at the AMC District in Tustin . They only had 2 days(4/20&4/21) & 2 showings. I was truly impressed at the quality & screenplay of this film . I enjoyed it completely ! I found myself engrossed in the story & the acting was amazing! Bravo to THE PROMISE! I truly hope there will be some Oscar nominations for this film!!!! Also to all that are giving poor reviews & haven't seen it . I urge you to watch the film with all negativity aside & see it for its acting, directing , & screen play. I believe you will come to a different conclusion . Happy Movie Going!"
" The Promise
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,9,Saw the film last night with my family and was moved to tears. We were beyond sadness by the historic and tragic sequence of events. I would thoroughly recommend this film to all. Many do not know the plight of the Armenian people both historically and biblically. This film provides details of the genocide of the Armenian people by the Turks.
" A Great movie for the ages
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"A great movie both factually correct and very entertaining...A worthwhile film to watch..And you'll send a message to the denialists campaign that truth and justice does matter...The hateful cover attempts will not work anymore..More movies will be made and the awareness of the ARMENIAN GENOCIDE will continue to grow...The pressure will continue for Turkey to acknowledge its murderous past to join the civilized world finally...It will become a better country for it like Germany post ww2....Please see this movie once,twice even three times and tell your family and friends to see it to send a message that the truth ,love and justice will prevail over lies,hatred and cover-ups"
" Great insight on this Historical Nightmare
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie was an amazing compilation of scenery, history and life lessons.I did not know about the Armenian genocide, I was sad, very sad throughout the movie and after, but it taught me an important lesson about resilience. This movie is powerful."
" The Promise
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie at a special screening in LA. Don't believe the negative reviews about this film. This is a must see movie! They've done a beautiful job making this film. I hope the Oscars will recognize this film next year. The cast did a wonderful job of telling a beautiful story. The epic cinematography of this film reminds me of another great film ""Empire of the. Sun""."
" Amazing, don't believe negative reviews from people in denial.
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Amazing movie during the Armenian Genocide. Do not believe the negative reviews from people still in denial. Such a powerful movie that takes place in the Ottoman Empire in present day Turkey and Armenia. I would definitely recommend this movie that has drama, love, history, mild violence, and politics."
" Truly exceptional
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Excellent movie. Great acting and talent. Sets the true historical facts about the Armenian genocide which have been recognized already by many countries, except the Turkish government being responsible for it, because they are the heirs of the Ottoman Turkish government, the true perpetrators of the genocide. Oscar Izig was fantastic. Also brilliant acting from Christian Bale ind Charlotte Le Bon. A must see. I highly recommend this movie."
" Best Film I have seen in ages
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"I am usually not a big fan of historical epic films however I was gripped by the story of the characters and the absolute beauty of the cinematography. I was not aware of the tragic history of the Armenian People and immediately googled ""Armenian Holocaust"" when the titles appeared at the end and was blown away that this story had not been told before... this movie was as moving and inspiring to me as ""Schindlers List"" and is as Oscar worthy!!! It is a must see and I have been telling all my friends to see it!!! Simply amazing film"
" Must be watched. Eye opening.
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Great sad love story in manner of Dr Zhivago with events taking place in Constantinople. Will be on my top 100 list. Drama unfolds very dark and silenced part of Turkish history. The sensitive and sad subject presented in delicate and modest manner. Great movie to go inline with Midnight Express (1978), Touch of Spice (2003), Hamam (1997) and Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul (2005)"
" Overall A MUST SEE MOVIE
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"This movie is exposing a genocide swept under the rug and is in dire need of acknowledgment so that people know it can never happen again. Even if you don't like the actors, all the box office money from this film goes to various charity organizations(i.e. Elton John's AIDS Foundation, UCLA Law school Center, etc.). SO PLEASE WATCH THE PROMISE and expand your knowledge on history and donate to amazing charities while doing so!!!!!Plus its actors and directors are A-List so expect a show!!"
" Unreal!
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"We got to see this masterpiece last night, tears of joy and sadness were on everyone's face. Mr Bale absolutely nailed it! We have seen many movies on the holocaust but finally a movie on the Armenian genocide. I loved the balance between actual history and romance. It saddens me that many will miss this movie because of politics, but please watch it, this is a very big part of world history."
" A Masterpiece
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"The Promise was nothing short of pure perfection. From the detailed set design to the outstanding performance of the cast, to the hunting sound of duduk, this movie left me speechless and in tears. It not only showed the travesties the Armenians went through during the Armenian Genocide in the 1915, it showed raw human emotions by the beautiful love story. I traveled back to time with Michael, fell in love with Anna, and felt the pain and the anguish of every fallen soul. I highly encourage everyone to see this movie and to #keepthePromise."
" It goes home with you...
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,9,"Didn't realize that over 2 hours had gone by when the movie ended. You're talking to a restless person here who can't sit still.It's good. Be sure to take more than one handkerchief.Well done, Mr. Kevorkian. Thank you. Sorry you're not around to see it. Maybe you do see it, from heaven.Good cinematography, good music with Traditional Armenian-music overtones, or is it undertones.Very powerful. Can you last through the movie without getting angry? I ask myself, what if you were a Turk and you went to see this film, would you be sad, or would you be angry, or would you be upset that there are Armenians all over the world, and they do not forget.Thank you for reading my brief comments. It could be longer, but I do not want to antagonize people unnecessarily. Please, just go see the film before you post your opinions. Thank you."
" A love story set during the Armenian genocide
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"It was an excellent movie. The acting, story, and music were great. The backdrop of the Armenian genocide was very powerful. I felt emotional throughout the entire movie. As a descendant of genocide survivors, this story hit me hard and felt very close to home. I would absolutely recommend to see this movie."
" We promise to survive
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"Very well produced movie to tell the story about the Armenian Genocide--their love and dedication to one another, their faith, and the growing strength of survival. This film truly moves you and immerses you in the devastation of genocide. It is a saddening yet motivating storyline that puts into perspective how lucky we are to be alive as Armenians."
" Incredible Film
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"Hands down one of the best films I have seen in such a long time. It truly amazed me at how this Armenian Genocide has been so minimized. Truly heartbreaking.It will surely make you appreciate everything that you have. I just don't understand why this was never recognized. Everyone know about the Jewish Genocide, why not the Armenian. I am thankful that this was produced. Much more meaningful than another fast car movie. I came home and began to explore the history."
" Intense but important
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,9,"It is the early stages of World War I. The world is a tinderbox, but the beauty of Constantinople seems a haven from the ugliness. Different ethnic groups come together to learn, to shop, to live. But the ugliness of the tinderbox invades this idyllic setting, and all too soon, friends are divided into classes by those who wish to create more chaos.Follow the story of Mikael and Ana, proud Armenians; Chris Myers, an American reporter seeking the truth and unafraid to lift the veil; Emre, a Turk who risks it all for his friends; and a people who overcame the horrors of genocide. Their story must be told so that we can truly keep the promise and never again sit idly by while a people and nation is destroyed.In short, you need to see this. Truly. No joke. If you want mindless entertainment, this isn't your movie, but if you want something thought-provoking and inspiring, The Promise more than delivers."

" A Step Into History of the Origin of the word Genocide
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"Dr. Raphael Lemkin created the word Genocide in describing what happened to the Armenians by the Turkish government. He was trying to bring attention to the Jewish people in Germany.The movie was an exposure in what happened during World War I in Turkey to the Armenian people. It was tied in with a love story along with the brutality. Had it not been for the American press, the Danish and German missionaries who bravely documented the atrocities and helped the Armenians, no one would have known the extent of the carnage.It was a great picture, and it went by quickly. The acting was realistic. Christian Bale did a realistic performance as the AP reporter."
" A beautiful film about the atrocities of the Ottoman government against its Armenian Citizens.
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"The tragic historical accounts of the Armenian Genocide is told beautifully by director Terry George, with outstanding performances by Christian Bale, Oscar Isaacs, Charlotte Le Bon, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Angela Sarafyan, Marwan Kenzari and the rest of the impressive cast.

" Historically accurate and honest movie!
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie at a private screening and everyone couldn't stop crying, that was a success for a movie that didn't make whole lot of violent scenes ( even though there is more than enough historic footage and proof). I really enjoyed how the love story was the main action that made the movie very easy to watch and relate to, but also did an honest and very respectful story of historic facts of 1915 Ottoman Empire atrocities against Armenians. I hope that we as a civilization can deal with our past and not let things like this happen again. It is especially timely right now, when the same region is under fire and violence."
" Wow!
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"Such a great and inspiring movie. Great acting and beautiful story. It just got me excited in every scene to know what's going to happen next. This is a movie that should be seen by everyone especially Turks to be educated in what happened in 1915. And yes it was genocide, not a massacre. More movies as such should be made to educate the world in a series of issues that have been taking place and have a lack of knowledge of that issue."
" Great A+
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,Wonderful cast and film! See it and judge for yourself. Kind of interesting how Turkey has turned toward being authoritarian recently. So this movie is very appropriate for the times and reminds of what happens when humanity remains quite and does speak to the injustices of the times. A must watch for all.
" Give this movie a chance!
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"To potential viewers - This movie deserves a chance because never before has there been a major motion picture that's capture the Armenian genocide in it's plot. Go see it! To IMDb, shame on you! You've allowed your ratings to be hacked and have done nothing about it thus far. There is no way that over 100K individuals have rated this movie, more than half giving it a one star, when the movie is not even out yet. No way! Potential viewers could look at the FALSE ratings on your site and be turned away simply because someone rigged the votes. Nice work. If this was a holocaust movie, you would correct the problem instantly."
" Must See
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"An amazing movie that everyone must watch! Do not mind the low rating given by Turkish people. They can keep denying. The movie is based on true facts and that makes it even more tragic. With the Armenian Genocide Commemoration day coming up (April 24), it's a good movie to watch to educate yourself. Lots of history, culture, emotions, pain, disgust, human tragedy, humanism, pride, desperation and hope in one movie. I just couldn't hold my tears. I don't want to go into details of the plot, it is just one story out of the millions that fell in this tragedy. But the movie is well made as it makes you care for every character and submerge into the story."
" Fraudulent ratings on IMDb
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie at TIFF and am planning on seeing it again as it is an incredibly powerful, moving and epic film. Yet, it is rated with only 2 stars ??? This is obviously a result of Turkish activists opposing the presentation of true historic facts as they cannot face up to their own history. IMDb, in an attempt to remain a credible website for movie reviews, should do their homework to accept only confirmed and valid ratings by people who have actually seen the movie and not posting for their political gain."
" In the midst of the ill-hearted and uneducated, a cinematic masterpiece rises with a backdrop rooted in Facts
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"During a time of turmoil and GENOCIDE, a film is set with the blissful hope of not only entertaining but educating the viewing public about historically factual events which defined tragedy for one nation, one race, and one culture. Amongst the GENOCIDE of the Armenian people by the Turkish Ottoman Empire, a love story unfolds that becomes not only reminiscent of a people's will to withstand tyranny but to also forge their passion, desire, and love for their own race even more than before. It becomes a fluid and tussled romantic metaphor for a culture's need to prevail despite the failed yet HEAVILY DOCUMENTED GENOCIDE by no one other than TURKEY. It was documented as the 1st genocide of the 20th century and even gave the tyrant's tyrant, Adolf Hitler, the inspiration to commit such a heinous, unforgivable, and disgusting act as the Holocaust. Because he in fact once said ""Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?"" We do! We transform into a well thought out, beautifully created, FACTUAL film brimming with Oscar nominated and Oscar worthy talent. Because after all, WE speak of the (FAILED) Annihilation of the Armenians! This beautiful film expresses that through a prolific love story, a love not even turkey was able commit genocide against."
" Amazing movie
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,Amazing movie with great acting. It's a true story about the Armenian Genocide that took place about 100 years ago. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie to understand the truth about the history that actually took place. I believe this movie is Oscar worthy and will get a lot of credit for it's historical facts.
" Emotional, Dramatic and Historically Based
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,8,"As a fan of historical drama this film met all my expectations plus. It's very emotional and stands to enlighten the American public regarding the seldom spoken about Armenian Genocide of the early 19th century. It is germane to what is transpiring in the Middle East now and is emblematic of what ISIS is doing to Christians today. A shame that Barak Obama could never get himself to utter the words Armenian Genocide, instead using the euphemism 'Great Crime'. This movie made me want to check out Wikipedia when I returned home."
" Great movie
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,First off the low ranking of this movie is entirely due to genocide-denial trolls. Second off anything that Oscar Isaacs touches is gold. see this movie not just because it's a good movie but also because it shows an important story that is still actively being suppressed. Don't let the trolls win.
" Tear-jerker done right
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,"Great movie, especially the performances. It is a tear-jerker, so, be warned. I didn't expect more than a romance-in-war movie, and it was much more profound than that--but even so the romance element felt real, rather than tacked on to a movie. That's pretty rare no matter the genre. I highly recommend this movie."
" Amazing Movie
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,I cant wait to go and see this movie with my class this Friday. For the longest time us Armenians have been wanting to spread the news about our past history and I feel like this movie will achieve that goal. This movie will help spread the hardships that we have faced in the past
" Fantastic!
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,"A fantastic fictional movie set against the backdrop of a very real genocide at the hands of a Turks who still deny to this this day the over 1 million lives they snuffed out. Do not hesitate to see this, there are definitely false reviews here to crash the ratings because they are afraid. Not gonna happen."
" Amazing
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,"I can't wait to see the movie. Armenians have wanted to spread the news about the Armenian genocide and to get it recognized. This movie will help us be able to spread about the Armenian genocide, and we might get recognition for it. I am very happy that this movie will be shown in many theaters."
" Promise is good
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,I am going to watch this movie on Friday with my class. It is a great movie. Go watch it. From what is read it is a beautiful representation of hardships and what the Armenian people faced. It is very important for people to watch movies like this and understand the history behind every culture. We as a nation need to respect human rights and have a fair understanding and fair reputation.

I love how we're having a big hit movie, playing in a lot of local movie theatres around me. A lot of people are finally going to see what we've been through, and we're going to be recognized for what's been being denied for a long time.

" Shame

" Very touching movie.
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,I'm dismayed at all the fraudulent negative reviews but I am not surprised. The Turkish government has brainwashed its people in believing the genocide never happened. The truth always comes out. The movie was slow at times but very powerful. I highly recommend this film.
" See this movie
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,9,"It may be a contrived love story, but it is set in a powerful moment in history that should never be denied or forgotten; had the world acknowledged then the first mass genocide of the 20th century for what it was, the Jewish Holocaust would not have been carried out with such ease."
" Fantastic movie about the Armenian GENOCIDE
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,"Fort those of you who are not in the know; a group of Internet trolls gathering on a Turkish message board decided to try sinking ""The Promise"" with bad reviews before it even came out. The movie is about the Armenian genocide that occurred under the Ottoman empire. Turkey, in a failed effort to cover up their crime, is denying the atrocities out of sheer hypocrisy ."
" Dark Point in History
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,"It is incredible to me that this movie is rated a 5.3 out of 10. It is very clear that Propaganda of Genocide deniers is behind this poor rating. I would urge IMDb to find these fraud reviews and take them down. Also, I would recommend we all go and see this movie as it highlights a very important part of human History."
" A great movie, a necessary movie
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,"The Promise is the greatest historical movie ever made. It tells the tale of the Armenian Holocaust, perpetrated by the Young Turks. It was the greatest crime in history, worse than any other genocide.The movie is brilliant! No other movie has ever been so historically accurate about any genocide, especially one so denied by Turkey and its trolls. The cinematography is spell-binding, the acting brilliant, and the story...well, the story of the worst crime in human history tells itself."

" Brilliantly Executed Depiction!
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,The Armenian Genocide was a tragedy of epic proportions! This tragedy is brought to light in a very emotional and well acted movie -- long overdue. Story execution was on point. The setting was beautiful and closely resembled the actual locations. Would have enjoyed more history and a little less focus on the love triangle of the characters but this didn't take away from the film at all. Will watch again and recommend to all my family and friends!
" Fake ratings!
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,"Something should be done with these negative reviews! This is not acceptable 50.9% of 1 star, this is a premeditated act. I think IMDb should pay attention to this or at least rethink their review/rating policy.This movie represents Armenian history and what we had gone through! I am sure it's a must-see and these reviews are totally anti- Armenian."
" Amazing! Truth telling story!
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,10,"Finally this important and very relevant historical atrocity is being given much needed attention! Great movie, great acting! If you want to learn about WWI and the Genocide that took place during that time, and set the tone for the century of genocides to follow this is a must see. I wish more people saw this, but they will get to in a few days!"
" Great Movie excellent actors
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,10,I saw so many bad reading here on IMDb and found out that most of these rating are political motivated to prevent people watching this amazing movie and learning about the Armenian Genocide i mean how can you give over 100.000!! 1 start rating before it's in the Theatres.I am glad i watched this Movie and recommend everyone else to watch it.
" Love it
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,10,"Finally a true representation of history. The movie is very well made and interesting. Highly recommend. Not sure how all the people who gave it a one star can actually do so. What I liked about it is that it is not just historic movie but there was actually a human aspect to it. I have seen other movies representing the ""Armenian Genocide"" but they have all been somewhat amateurish. This one is a true movie that even people who are not into the historic side of it can enjoy."
" A very good and VERY important movie
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,9,"Watched a screening of this movie at UCLA last night, followed by a panel discussion with the film's director (Terry George) and producers Mike Medavoy & Eric Esrailian. Very well told narrative highlighting an often overlooked piece of history, the genocide of the Armenian people in Turkey during WWI. Very well acted & directed, with noticeable homages to both Schindler's List & Dr. Zhivago. The story & characters really drew me in. Probably could have been 15-20 minutes shorter as some scenes were unnecessary and overly long. A little melodramatic at times, and some scenes felt contrived for dramatic purposes, but considering the human tragedy that this movie portrayed, those scenes felt justified. Would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants a better understanding of this dark stain on human history."
" Great Movie
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,10,"Great Movie! A must See. Was not really interested at first and got dragged into seeing the movie but I was glad I did. from beginning to end it is full of great drama and keeps you on the edge of your seat.best movie I seen this year. I would recommended to everyone, CB plays a great roll and finally good to see him in a meaningful movie."
" Fantastic Movie! A Must See!
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,10,"I was able to see this movie during a private screening at the US Capitol with Director Terry George. It is an absolutely beautiful movie! A love story mixed within the truthful events of what actually transpired during the Armenian Genocide. For those individuals who want to see and understand how and why the Ottoman Empire decided to systemically kill 1.5 million Armenians and erase any notion of their existence, I suggest you go see the movie when it opens April 21st. I intend to take family and friends to see it because it is an important part of our world history and an education tool on why we as global citizens must recognize its occurrence and never allow it to happen again. It makes me very happy knowing that the producers of the movie are going to be using this film as an educational tool in schools and donating proceeds of the movie to several charities. Well done!"
" Finally Hollywood screened a movie depicting the Truth about the Armenian Genocide
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,10,"An excellent movie and amazing Cast. In other words two in one , which means that apart describing the real events of Armenian Genocide , the movie also illustrates a love triangle between Anna and two handsome men. So who will choose Anna? Micheal or Chris? I recommend everyone to watch the movie."
" Finally, a mainstream film on the Armenian genocide!
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,9,"How incredibly refreshing and heartening that Hollywood finally has a film that effectively captures some of the under-reported atrocities perpetrated by Ottoman Turks against approximately 1.5 million Armenians at the beginning of the 20th century. Rendered easier to watch by inserting a love triangle into the film, it portrayed death marches into the desert, poisonings, and what looked to be killings of groups by bayonets and left in heaps by the riverside. It also showed how some Turks provided refuge to Armenians during the roundups in the streets, which is how the relatives of many modern day Armenians survived. I'm giving this important movie a 9 only because I wished the role of Ana (played by Charlotte Le Bon) should have been played by an Armenian woman! The film ended on an emotional (yet not manipulatively so) note--the battle of Musa Dagh--where Armenians resisted on the hill. While the closing credits noted that Turkey has not acknowledged the genocide, they should also have noted that the U.S. has not formally acknowledged it as well."
" Excellent Film!
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,10,"Excellent Film! Those who provide a 1 star of 10 clearly are not actually rating the film, but providing political feedback. How many who have rated it as 1 in 10 have actually seen the film? Some of the rants are a clear attempt at revisionist history to try to rationalize the actions of the Ottomans."
" Wonderful Film
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,10,"I'm not surprised, that some ""critics"" will be ""criticizing"" and naming this film as ""boring"". The film is Must see and it's based on true story. It is worth checking out this movie. Many Armenians have died in 1915, under the Ottoman Empire – i.e. The Turkish government.

" Truly riveting
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,10,"At first, I was very hesitate to watch the film due to the low rating but after tons of research I learned why the film was given such low rating. Due to the reason that this movie is based on the Armenian Genocide, a true event in history that the government of Turkey continues to this day deny, many Turks have rated it a score ""1"" without even seeing the film and are simply spreading propaganda. After finally watching this film at a premiere, I can confidently state that this was one of the best historical dramas I've ever seen. Terry George, once again, directs an incredible film where you truly experience the intensity of events and simultaneously learn about stories untold. An compelling and strong movie that stops political propaganda and helps viewers witness the truth."
" Historic war atrocities and romance
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,7,"Greetings again from the darkness. I've said this before, but mixing romance with historical war time dramas is fraught with peril – it's a difficult line to navigate. Writer/director Terry George (Hotel Rwanda) and co-writer Robin Swicord (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) have delivered a sweeping historical epic that is immensely watchable by not over-blowing the romantic triangle, the war atrocities or the courage and bravery of the main characters.The one-too-many lovers are played by the talented Oscar Isaac as medical student wannabe Mikael; Christian Bale as Chris, an American war correspondent; and blossoming international star Charlotte Le Bon as Ana, an American tutor based in Constantinople. These are three varied and distinct characters we accept because they have admirable qualities, as well as human flaws.Mikael marries a local girl (Angela Sarafyan who was the robot with hypnotizing eyes HBO's ""Westworld"") for the sole purpose of using the dowry to pay for medical school. His ""promise"" is that he will return and learn to love her (so romantic!). Chris is a hard-driving and hard drinking journalist who is not welcome most anyplace he goes and finds himself in quite a predicament with his job, girlfriend and life. It's not until later in the story that he flashes a caring heart underneath his armor of brash. Ana is nearly angelic at times in her goodness and with a smile that lights up the screen. Her devotion to Chris is as odd as her attraction to Mikael, but seeking logic in matters of love is often a journey without merit.The story is based around the time of WWI and specifically highlights the Armenian Genocide – something the Turkish government denies to this day, referring to it instead as a ""relocation"" of nearly 1.5 million Armenians. The film began as a passion project for Armenian-American Kirk Kerkorian, a businessman, philanthropist and the once owner of MGM Studios. He raised the money and helped assemble the team, but unfortunately passed away just before production began. He would undoubtedly be proud of the finished film, and find some solace (if not humor) in the fact that it hits theatres only a few weeks after The Ottoman Lieutenant, a Turkish government backed project that purposefully ignored the atrocities and leaned heavily to a singular view of history.The cast is deep and included (one of my favorites) Shohreh Aghdashloo as Mikael's wise and courageous mother, Tom Hollander (""The Night Manager"") as a fellow prisoner of the Turks, James Cromwell as an American Ambassador, Rade Serbedzija as a leader of the Armenian resistance, and Jean Reno as a commander of the French Naval fleet that plays a vital role in 1915.Cinematographer Javier Aguirresorobe captures some breathtaking vistas and desert landscapes, while also delivering the intimacy and urgency of both the romantic and dangerous moments (including a spectacular rain-drenched train sequence). The acting is superb throughout, with Bale dialing back his sometimes over-exuberant traits, Isaac giving us someone to pin our hopes on, and Ms. Le Bon bringing the compassion to an area when it's so desperately needed. Expect to see her explode in popularity and respect when the right leading role comes along. Lastly, it's rare that I would think this, but the film's 2 hour and 14 minute run time might have benefited from an additional 10-15 minutes of detail towards the Turkish military strategies, and both the Armenian resistance and slaughter. It's a part of history that should be neither ignored nor glossed over."
" A great period piece about a forgotten genocide. Superb.
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,10,"Dear IMDb, Yesterday I stumbled upon an article about a film called 'The Promise' and how it has received an unprecedented amount of negative reviews on your site. This film has been screened three times, one being at the Toronto Film Festival on September 11, 2016. And yet it has over 55,000 1-star reviews. How is that possible? This film is about a touchy subject for many because it centers around the time the Ottoman Empire carried out a genocide against the Armenian people. But since it is not possible that all these people have seen the film considering the simple fact that it has not been released anywhere yet, how can people leave negative reviews about a film they've never seen? In my humble opinion, it really questions your website's credibility. This film was produced by someone who had a vision and his name was Kirk Kerkorian. He put many of his earnings on the line to put this movie into production. The director, Terry George, is one of the most renowned and respected in Hollywood. The cast is made up of countless brilliant actors. This film has quality written all over it and yet it is being unfairly rated down by people who haven't seen it. It is a known fact that the Turkish government and people have been denying this genocide for over a century and are willing to go to great lengths for it to remain unrecognized. But to allow your website to become a weapon of Turkish denial and propaganda is not the standard that your company set for itself when IMDb was launched. Your website has always been a respectable portal of knowledge about all films of the world, so I am in real disbelief as to why a film that has not been released to the public is being defamed and down- rated by Internet trolls. As I said, this whole situation just questions the validity of IMDb. Please do not allow this to keep happening. There are so many people who dedicated their time and effort to the making of this film. They spent millions of dollars to make it happen. This film tells a story of an event that the world needs to know about. And until people have the chance to see it with their own eyes and in turn draw their own conclusions, please do not allow this kind of spiteful rating to continue. Please do not let your site become another place of hateful political ranting. It only does you a great disservice.""Was the above review useful to you? Yes No"
" Incredibly moving
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,10,"If I could give this movie more than 10 stars, I would. I am not a big movie goer but I was able to attend a private, advance screening of this film and it was incredible. Seriously, just WOW. The acting, particularly from Oscar Isaac, was top notch. There are a lot of people out there trying to make this into a propaganda film: Turks vs. Armenians. Here's the truth: it's a film about humanity. Yes, it depicts the Armenian Genocide because, guess what? IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. However, it also showcases very well all the complexities and depths of humanity: from the levels of depravity we can reach to the levels of selflessness and love. Every single person in that theater was moved. This is a film for everyone. And hey, you might even learn something. Run, don't walk. GO!"
" Excellent movie/documentary presenting the tragic Armenian history
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,10,The actors and the directors do an excellent job in sharing this history in a two hour long movie. It's a great opportunity for people who are interested in history to watch and see what the Armenians have gone through during those dark periods. For people not interested in history it's still a great movie to watch with high quality.

",2017-04-15 00:00:00,10,"This is a best film ever, and I think each human must watch this to know what happened to Аrmenians a century ago. Everyone must see the real face of Turks, must know the truth, which is hidden from even Turkish people. I think it was a great idea to make this film. Some day we'll have back everything, I'm sure..."
" ""The Promise"" is a powerfully engaging and enlightening drama.
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"The most infamous genocide in history, Adolf Hitler's murder of 6,000,000 Jews during World War II, was not the first genocide to take place, or even the first one of the 20th century. Nearly three decades before the term genocide was even coined, from 1915 to 1923, the government of the Ottoman Empire (present day Turkey) killed 1,500,000 ethnic Armenians within their borders. Under the cover of World War I, the Ottoman government carried out mass executions, subjected able-bodied men to forced labor and drove women, children and the elderly on death marches into the Syrian Desert. As with any human tragedy, personalizing the story brings about greater understanding of the events that took place. That is what the drama ""The Promise"" (PG-13, 2:12) attempts to do, drawing its inspiration from historical events and adapting part of Franz Werfel's 1933 novel, ""The Forty Days of Musa Dagh"", the first book that brought the story of the Armenian Genocide widespread attention around the world.Mikael Boghosian (Golden Globe winner Oscar Isaac) is from a small Armenian village, but dreams of becoming a doctor so he can be of service to his people. He is engaged to Maral (Angela Sarafyan) and, with the blessing of her and her family, plans to use her dowry to go to Constantinople (modern Istanbul) to study medicine. Mikael promises Maral that he will return to her as soon as he graduates. In Constantinople, he meets people who would later have a big impact his life, including fellow medical student (and son of an Ottoman military officer) Mustafa (Numan Acar), American journalist Chris Myers (Oscar winner Christian Bale) and Chris' girlfriend, a beautiful Armenian named Ana (Charlotte Le Bon), who was raised in France and is serving as nanny to the children of Mikael's uncle in Constantinople.As World War I turns Ottoman society into a military state, Mustafa helps Mikael avoid being forced into the Ottoman Army, based on his medical student exemption. This deferment is short-lived, however. When Mikael tries to help his uncle who has been arrested, he himself is sent to a forced labor camp. Mikael escapes and returns to his village where his mother (Oscar nominee Shohreh Aghdashloo) urges him to take Maral and hunker down in a cabin in the woods, unaware that Mikael has fallen in love with Ana. Meanwhile, Chris is jeopardizing his freedom and even his life by steadfastly reporting on the military rounding up ethnic Armenians. The intensifying Ottoman campaign against the Armenians causes Mikael to repeatedly cross paths with Ana and Chris, as they all fight to survive, to help the Armenian people and, ultimately, to resolve the very personal issue of their complicated love triangle.""The Promise"" is a powerfully engaging and enlightening drama. The film's story is similar to that of ""The Ottoman Lieutenant"", which was released earlier in 2017, but ""The Promise"" has a more widely and deeply talented cast. It also has a better script, written by Terry George (who also directs this film and previously co-wrote and directed 2004's ""Hotel Rwanda""), along with Robin Swicord. As deeply as the movie goes into the suffering of the Armenian people, it never loses touch with the individual human stories which drive its plot. There's plenty of drama on the personal level, as well as in the overarching political and military realms. The romance subplot, which could have ended up sappy or emotionally manipulative in the hands of a lesser director, further adds to the film's impact. Although the ""promise"" isn't as integral as the title implies, this is an otherwise exceptional film. ""A-"""
" Outstanding revelation of the Armenian genocide - know for a century
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,10,"Excellent account of WW I Armenian genocide by the Turks. The review score is low because the TURKS still do not accept the fact that they did a crime against humanity.Christian Bale and Oscar Isaac, I assume, did this for low pay. They just wanted the sad story told.The truth shall set you free. You are not free yet - by a long shot."
" A love story set in trying times of war
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,10,"A thoughtful, and excellently made film by the Director of Hotel Rwanda exposing in further detail the genocide of a million and a half Armenians by the Ottoman Turks, a fact still denied by present-day Turkey. Basically beginning as a love story, it delves into the atrocities committed against the Armenians that displaced them from their homes, slaughtering them as they tried to flee. Henry Morgenthau, US Ambassador at the time, tried to help but his pleas fell on deaf ears. A film not to be missed. Excellent portrayals by the cast, and kudos to all those associated with this film. Filmed in Malta, Spain and Portugal."
" The Movie is about the Armenian Genocide in 1915-1922 and Human Rights!
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,10,"I saw the movie during its primer on April 12, in the Chinese Theater. This is my objective opinion- -given that I am a descendant of survivors of the Armenian Genocide. ""The Promise"" is an extremely Powerful and thought provoking movie; every scene is depicted based on Historical Research and True Events. Alas, it was made 102 YEARS TOO LATE. Had the world stopped the tragic slaughter of innocent human beings then, the ongoing and current genocides would have never happened. This movie is to bring awareness to Leaders of Countries who currently are using the same technique, may be worse- -in uprootingv of innocent people in Syria, Iraq, and many African countries. I, and many of us hope that the movie ""The Promise;"" is actually a 'PROMISE' to end the barbaric treatments of harmless, blameless, and innocent people, children and elderly around the world. It is important to note; that the entire proceeds from the movie and the song written and sang by Chris Cornell will be going to charitable organizations worldwide."
" An Epic Film about the dark history of the Ottoman Empire
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,10,"A beautiful love story centered around the events leading to the 1915 mass deportation of Christian indigenous people of Turkey. The film is well written and directed by Academy Award winner Terry George (Hotel Rwanda) and some fine acting by Christian Bale and Oscar Issac. I recommend this film to all history and movie buffs, it will satisfy both. This film should be a reminder to everyone to #NeverStaySilent #StopGenocides."
" Exotic and informative
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,9,"I am definitely going to watch this film again. It is so exotic because it is based on the Ottoman Empire, which not every kid is entirely aware of. The school subject I dislike most is history, but after seeing this film, my mind is forever changed because I am fascinated about how much goes on in the world. The Promise is set in the Ottoman Empire, in Armenia, the eastern part of the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Mikael Pogosian (Oscar Isaac) is a young, Armenian medical student who recently married in order to receive an endowment to pay for medical school. He leaves for Istanbul to further his studies. In the midst of his medical endeavors World War 1 breaks out and Armenia is deeply involved in it. When he travels to Istanbul, a mass Armenian genocide is initiated and he has to overcome these obstacles with Ana (Charlotte Le Bon), a woman he begins to fall in love with. Since her husband, Chris Myers (Christian Bale) is not too happy, a love triangle begins to form. Pogosian and Le Bon work together to keep everyone safe and try to leave Turkey and go to the United States. Oscar Isaac (Mikael Pogosian), the protagonist, puts others first and acts solely on instinct, which is a great quality to possess. Ana (Charlotte Le Bon) has a kind heart and desires to save all of the Armenian children. Chris Myers (Christian Bale) is a reporter for the Armenian genocide and takes great pride in his work. The budget for this film must have been very large because there are hundreds of weapons utilized, many explosions and gunshots and many buildings destroyed. I love that the men ride on horses because horses are one of my favorite animals. It reminds me of history class because, in the past, soldiers rode on horseback. My favorite part of the film when Ana is teaching Pogosian how to dance with her cousins and Pogosian's cousin walks in. There is complete silence. Not many men dance, so it is entertaining to watch. The message of this film is to be informed about the past and to appreciate all that you have. Living in America, I feel fortunate to be safe and could not imagine what people in countries such as Armenia and Turkey have gone through. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars. Since there are many casualties and gory scenes, I recommend this film to children ages 16 to 18 and think adults will enjoy it too. This movie changes how I think. I learned so much from it. If you can watch intense scenes, then you should see it because it will change your life. It is a movie that you truly do not want to miss. Reviewed by Samantha M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
" Excellent Movie
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies I have ever seen, enjoyed every minute of it. The story takes you to another world and the harsh truth of the 1915 happenings by the Ottoman empires to the Armenian people.This film is about a touchy subject for many because it centers around the time the Ottoman Empire carried out a genocide against the Armenian people. But since it is not possible that all these people have seen the film considering the simple fact that it has not been released anywhere yet, how can people leave negative reviews about a film they've never seen?"
" History, love, war, hope and the Armenian Genocide
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,10,"An intriguing depiction of history, war, love and the faith of the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. Oscar Isaac, Christian Bale and Charlotte Le Bon provide extraordinary performances. Endorsed by Sylvester Stallone,Leonardo DiCaprio, George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, Elton John, Barbra Streisand, Cher and Andre Agassi among other public figures."
" Top film of 2017
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,10,"Excellent film showing the truth about the Armenian Genocide. Great actors, great director, overall amazing. I hope everyone watches this movie and learns a thing or two about what really happened to the Armenian people. This film received several thousand horrible reviews by people who did not want this film to be made, 1 star reviews from people that afraid that the truth will be exposed. A film that is not even in theaters, yet has over 60000+ reviews, with not even a 5.0/10 rating ? That should show a lot. Please take the time out of your day and watch this movie, and understand the truth about the Armenian Genocide."
" Don't listen to all the bad ratings!
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,9,"I just saw this movie at the Atlanta Film Festival and can't believe all the negative reviews that the film has on IMDb. Were they watching something else? I found it very moving and very entertaining. Maybe not a 9, but considering all the fake ratings, I feel like I need to bump up the average. When I saw that it was over 2 hours, I rolled my eyes, but I was pleasantly surprised about how much it kept my attention and I was often on the edge of my seat. What was most shocking of all is the fact that I had never heard this genocide had ever happened. It's been buried in history, and I'm glad that the filmmakers decided to bring this to light. I met an Armenian woman at the screening, and she was in tears about how glad she was that the story was finally being told. The film is not perfect, and I have some issues with the love story behind it, but the overall historical perspective makes this movie a must-see. It'll open your eyes, especially in these troubled political times."
" Enjoyable movie
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,10,"Really enjoyed the movie. Watched it at the Dallas film festival as a pre-screen. If you like history and based on true historical facts you'll enjoy this one. Very touching, moving, keeps you in suspense. Feel bad for the Armenian population but great to hear they still exist as a nation!"
" Good film
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,10,"A good film with good actors. I advise everyone to watch this film and think about it.The actors play excellently and felt everything on their own.It is very difficult to feel everything on yourself and experience what people experienced when they were killed, raped, and driven out of their homes. I hope those who watch this movie realize all that was going on in 1915."
" Great Movie
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,9,"A wonderful movie, love story though it is, as a former history teacher its time period around the 19teens is beautifully shown. It is a story that should not be ignored, the time period and events were atrocious and hard as the Turks try to cover and deny they fail miserably. Great acting by Christian Bale and the Iranian lady. Writing is good, story good, production good. With all the movies that are made and compared to how many are actually seen by MANY, this is one that should be considered for an Academy Award and actually seen by the masses (at least if they care about atrocities committed by mankind on a regular basis, unless they are hypocrites and just drop crocodile tears.)"
" Great Movie, Turks are afraid of the truth
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,10,"It is currently April 2, 2017. This movie has had 3 screenings and has not been out yet. Yet it has 92000 reviews with a 4.2 rating. Moonlight, which in February won the academy award for best picture and has been out for months has 117,000 reviews as of today. Do you think that maybe there is a consipiracy to try to sabotage this movie because the Turks do not want people to know what happened during the Armenian Genocide? They are stuffing the ratings with bad reviews so that people don't see this movie. The review organizations should better monitor their sites to get accurate reviews. A disgrace."
" Although sometimes slow, still a ""must see"".
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"I saw this movie at the Sonoma International Film Festival, and although I felt like it could have been edited tighter, it was an amazing story that I'm glad that I experienced. The acting was great, the period costumes and sets were flawless, and the story that it told was heartbreaking and needed to be told. I doubt there was a dry eye in the house (my wife and I certainly cried)."
" Great history
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely fantastic film, great history behind it and the actors and actresses play their roles with such passion. Definitely states a lot about the Ottoman Empire times and a lot of history behind many cultures who are still strong in growth as of today across the world. If you are interested in seeking a film that will pull you into the screen and get lost in suspense of disbelief then this is the movie of the year that you should invest your time into watching with no distractions."
" A dramatization of the first genocide of the 20th century.
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,10,"My wife, the president of San Jose State University, and I were fortunate to see this film at a festival in our hometown, San Jose. It played to a full house and a discussion followed with the director of the film. Years ago, in the 1920s, an attempt was made to make a film on the Armenian genocide following Franz Werfel's powerful book, The 40 Days of Musa Dag. As many know, the salvation of a small band of determined Armenian survivors were saved from the Mountain of Moses (Musa Dag) on the Mediterranean coast by a French warship.Ihe salvation of the persevering few was an inspiration to the Holocaust resistance movement in Nazi occupied Europe and copies were passed around from one cell to another.Unfortunately, the film was never distributed due to the collusion of a frightened, anti-communists State Department fearful of losing Ataturk to the Soviet sphere and a determined Turkish government to deny the ""murder of a nation,"" as the US Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morgenthau, term the Armenian genocide, a word to be invented later by Rafael Limpkin to suit the Armenian case.Turkish denial of the Armenian genocide continues to this day and the government of Turkey spends millions of dollars every year to hire lobbyists to influence American thinking. The thousands of negative votes on this film currently under consideration should be a dead giveaway that the Turkish government is once more active in trying to prevent the distribution of a film on the Armenian genocide. Furthermore, the Turkish government currently sponsored a film, The Ottoman Lieutenant, which gives the impression that all of the people of the Ottoman Empire in Anatolia suffered equally.The Promise is an excellent film bordering on greatness. I urge people to see it and judge for themselves."
" Amazing must-see film
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,10,"This film hits so many themes and is so moving and kept me engaged the whole time. It does a great job of shedding light to this time in history and has a great story line and actors.Shot with a beautiful backdrop and vibrant characters, it was both very entertaining and emotional to watch. Would 100% recommend. Bravo to the director and producer, truly an amazing piece of work!"
" Its about time the truth is coming out of the Armenian Genocide
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,10,Very proud there is a movie coming out about the Armenian genocide. My great grandparents survived this genocide and went through hell. It is a shame that the Turks are brain washed and in denial about something so cruel their people did. I also noticed a lot of those in denial are making horrible reviews to sway people's opinions to see the movie. Just horrible. Go see the movie for yourself to see the TRUTH!
" Great Cinematography For Such A Big Wound!
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,10,"I have not yet watched the movie but plan to when it is released. I cant believe there were fraudulent reviews on this movie, even now, they try to silence us. Anyways great actors, the shots are beautiful, although it does not teach EVERYTHING that took place during the genocide because there's just so much history that cant turn the movie into a documentary. :)"
" Overall great movie
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie at the Toronto film festival 4 or 5 months ago. It was honestly a very good movie. Christian Bale and Isaac did a good job acting in this movie. As a fellow Armenian, I am also disappointed in all the bad reviews that this movie has received. This movie is right now a 4.1 / 10 when it should really be closer to an 8 or 9 or at least a 7. This movie was rated before it even came out and it is not fair that it doesn't receive a fair rating. Overall this was a good movie. The music was well done by the singer of System of a Down and the director did a good job as well putting everything together. I would recommend seeing this movie for anyone who is out there."
" Best movie
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,10,Honestly one of the best movies i have seen this year. Such a great portrayal of true events of the Armenian genocide committed by the Turkish government. I don't want to give too much away but the movie is very well written with a great climax and ending. This movie with actually wake people up and will inform the audience. Overall Christian bale is an amazing headline actor. He does a great job on pulling off the role correctly. So glad this movie was made to shine light on the truth of the tragic events committed by the Turkish government. Waiting for this movie to be available for purchase! Will not leave any person in the theater not crying! Very good movie everyone should watch not just to be informed but the story is so interesting and creative!
" WATCH IT! see the TRUTH! Education will free you..
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"I loved the preview of the movie and know this movie can teach us more about the Armenian Genocide and what Armenians had to go through... As a Jewish American I can honestly say I know what the Armenian youth are going through my ancestors barely escaped the Holocaust, but I and my family are survivors and we will survive . The uneducated people who are on here and trying to get YOU as the viewer to not watch it isn't because of the quality of the film it is the history. They are afraid THEY WILL FACE HISTORY one more time and see what animals and disgusting creatures run their government and corrupt their citizens minds. Please allow yourself to step into the shoes of innocent people who lost their lives and to understand why Armenians are fighting and have fought 101 years for recognition. DO NOT ALLOW A PAID REVIEW OR FALSE COMMENTS from the other side to stir you from the truth. They can only hide from themselves not from God or reality. Enjoy the film I know I will!"
