" A Go To Movie
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,9,"I've watched it several times, and it's a go to movie and great story if you're looking for a pick me up. Definitely one of Costner's finest performances. Great performances by Maria Bello, Valente Rodriguez, and Morgan Saylor as well. The entire cast performed well. I work with Mexican immigrants in NE Ohio, and the work ethic on the film and what I see here, are spot on."
" Costner revitalised
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,8,Excellent ðŸ‘Œ Costner back at his best and the storyline is compelling
" Definitely watch this if you get the opportunity
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,8,"Well made, well acted. Hearty viewing.'McFarland, USA' sees Disney do a true story sports drama for what feels like the billionth time, but there's no disputing they sure do know how to create a wholesome and meaningful film for the genre; despite the clichÃ©s and predictability. This is no different, it's very good.Kevin Costner leads astutely as Jim White, while Carlos Pratts is the pick of the bunch when it comes to the younger guys. All of the latter, who play a group of runners that White coaches, are well cast in truth. I felt a connection to the story, thanks to the writing but also to them.It does turn into a very pleasant and enjoyable 128 minutes, it's also quite unique to see a sports film about cross-country running as opposed to the usual basketball, American football etc. Score/cinematography wise, it's good.Definitely watch this if you get the opportunity."
" Inspiring bio and unusual story
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,10,"McFarland is a truly great feel good movie. I found it impossible not to love the characters in this. Costner is excellent in this type of role, and he doesn't disappoint here. Great script, and a wide cast, cast well. The cinematography, locations, etc, raised this piece to a solid 10. A highly interesting and unusual story represents more than just it's own glory. Fantastic movie."
" In an overdone genre McFarland stands out
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,9,"Let's all be honest, this type of movie has been done waaaay too many times. I typically loath these flicks, if you've watched Afflecks most recent disaster you know what I mean. That said, this movie has a lot of heart & soul. Kevin Costner was amazing. This is based on a true story & the way they captured that was impressive. Do yourself a favor & give it a shot."
" I cannot wait to watch it again
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,9,"I loved this movie!!! This was the best movie I have seen in a long time. I was totally immersed from start to finish. I just love how this movie showed such positiveness about people. I love how even the one most not picked for the team did so well in this movie. I just loved this movie! And Kevin Costner's facial expressions were so good. I think everybody should see this movie, runner, athlete, or not!!!"
" A great movie.
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,9,"This film is based on the true story of James ""Jim"" White, a cross-country coach in McFarlan, from 1987 to 2003 his country-cross team won nine state championships in Divisions III and IV.
The fact that the film is based on a true film gives him a very special strength.
Besides I envoy very sports movies in which young men or women are showing the best of themselves (self-improvement).
McFarland USA is also a film about the friendship: little by little Jim and his family will know the Latino families (eating enchiladas, celebrating 15 years feast for example)."
" Wonderful movie that should have been a huge comeback for Costner as a leading man
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely love this movie. Maybe I am a tad biased because I actually only live about 50 minutes away from the McFarland of the title, so the culture of the San Joaquin Valley where the movie takes place as well as some of the details of Hispanic culture were very familiar to me. Sure it's a predictable and formulaic story, but even so I have rarely felt a deep connection to a movie of this formula as I have to this one. I thought this movie would be a huge smash when it was released and would revive Kevin Costner as a leading man. Keeping in mind of course his career tanked badly after 1995's Waterworld and although he has had hits in supporting roles like Man of Steel and Hidden Figures both of which were huge hits, he has never found a huge hit sadly in the last two decades as a leading actor. I thought this would have been that huge hit that would have revitalized him as a leading man, but it was only a modest box office success sadly, and Costner's career remains exactly where it was before the release of this movie. He has made some poor career choices since the mid-90's but this film was not one of them, and this should have been a much bigger hit. I think a lot of the reason why this film didnt do as well as I anticipated was because audiences were tired of the same old Disney sports movie formula. Well this movie has more depth than would be expected. This has insight into every one of its characters and breaks away from the traditional sports movie formula. Perhaps if you are not familiar with Central California culture that could have been another reason why it didnt catch on with audiences. This movie was huge in the area I live and played in theaters for over three months, but it was nowhere as big elsewhere. Still this is an absolute treasure, with Costner at his absolute best. I hope he can make a comeback eventually as a leading man. But most importantly this is a magnificent film in every way that should have made him the big star he was decades ago. If you haven't seen it and think it will be another Costner stinker watch it and be proven wrong. If you think the story will be predictable from beginning to end you will be pleasantly surprised."
" Really good and sweet, which I was not expecting
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,10,"McFarland, USA was actually really good, which I was not expecting. Of course, I suppose I had been biased against it because it was filmed at my high school in the midst of my junior year, and the entire student body was annoyed that we had to put up with these giant wooden barriers with doorways cut into them that were set up in the busiest outdoor covered hallway, oftentimes couldn't use our office building (which is where the office scenes at the school were filmed), the front of the school, the service road (which was where they took the bus from to state), the football field/dirt track, the PE area (where they drank at the water fountain when the Diaz boys weren't there), and many other places. We could even hear them yelling ""McFarland!"" while we were in classes. I also remember that the day we heard Kevin Costner was there, my English teacher, Ms. Hill (a 5' nothing, 65 year old black woman) ran out of class as soon as the bell rang for nutrition and ran halfway across campus just to meet one of her favorite actors. That was a major feat, given that the halls were extremely congested for months because they left up the wooden structures.In general, the entire student body was annoyed with the intrusion into our education for a movie about a track team?! Everyone thought it was dumb. (I didn't learn that it was actually about a cross country team until I sat down to watch the movie.) Given that the sport of choice at Cleveland was football, nobody was happy in the slightest. Then, we learned that it was about a Latino team dealing with racism in the sport, and most students were ok with it again, given that Cleveland is also located in a predominantly Latino area, and the majority of the student body reflects that, so everyone understood. Additionally, my brother ran track and cross country throughout middle and high school, so watching this movie with my family also added another layer to it because we recognized the places that the team ran as places my brother ran.Given that I had so much bias against it because they filmed it at my school, it really says a lot that McFarland, USA ended up being a lot better than I expected it to be. It's pretty wholesome, even though it deals with serious subjects at times, like racism and the lives of pickers. It's also got moments of hilarity. All in all, not a bad way to spend a couple hours."
" McFarland, USA
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,3,"For a movie about running, this is awfully slow-going."
" Nice
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,6,"Well acted, well written and well directed sports story. Able acting by Kevin Costner."
" run to the hills and far away
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,6,"Gary moore once sang in a song from the 80's, did they find their inspiration from that or from run to the hills of iron maiden? anyway its a sports movie, a film about growing patiently from nothing to win it all. its not a funny movie, but like all american sprts flicks it happens to have a winner in the end, and its a darn happy ending too...as a filmproduct it follows all the moviemakers cliches that could be found whenever they are making a sports movie. what drags this film down on my scale of starawards is the unbelievable slow pace on the development of this movie. its like the director have said ''all you need to do is run'' to the actors, and may you thirst to death in the baking summer sun in central californian desert. there are not much finesse nor fantasy behind this victory, just running and that is just like forrest gump, at the end of his criss cross country running coming to a halt, ''i wanna go home'' and that really lingered my mind several times.the grumpy old man loves movies where the underdog wins, this was allreit and nothing more than that"
" Ridiculous
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,3,The race scenes had the McFarland team running at sprint pace: they'd barely finish a 10k let a cross country circuit and was appeared more suited to sumo wrestling!
" Excellent biopic!
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,8,"I've seen this film a few times, and again today after a long time. I can't get bored of it. A story about commitment, dreams, not giving up, family and sport. Excellent biopic with great directing, writing and performances. These type of films are right up Costner's alley."
" How to become a winner.
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Again, Kevin Costner stands for high quality. Unlike many sports dramas that celebrate the winners rising from ashes with much melodrama, this movie keeps its feet on the ground. Winning doesn't come overnight, but is a path of development for both parties: the runners and their coach. The quality storyline of McFarland follows this path, yet without boring repetition nor lengthy distracting side-plots. The cultural gap between the Hispanic runners and their American coach is at the centre of this development. If you want an ongoing 90min winner's high you may prefer another movie."
" Nice Slice of Life
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)This is a true story of a big city high school football coach gets fired and is forced move his family and take a job at a small and poor California town with a heavy Mexican population of field pickers. He bands together a cross country team of picker's sons and begins to give them hope, confidence and self-worth. He also must earn their respect and truly get to know them and their way of life. Will they be able to compete and make it to the state championship? This is the definition of a feel good movie yet never feels cheesy; almost. Has some picturesque shots, clear story and touching moments in a fairly unique tale while making high school cross country look lightly moderately exciting."
" THEY TREAT YOU LIKE A PICKER
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,8,"Jim White (Kevin Costner) is a football coach whose luck and temperament has lead him to McFarland, the last stop. He moves his family into the Hispanic community and instructs kids who are ""invisible and expendable."" His daughter asks, ""Are we in Mexico?"" After watching some of the kids run, he decides to form a cross country team, which initially shows little support from the community. As Jim and his family give back to the community and strive to understand them, they discover a community who is family and supportive as his family becomes one of them.Yes this is another true Cinderella story. We know how they end, or else they would have never made the film. This one doesn't involve basketball, football, or AP calculus, which makes it a bit dry. The community drama was minimal, as it would be in real life, and Costner would not have been in my top 10 people to play Jim White.It is a feel good film based on a true story suitable for most families."
" Coach Costner
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,7,Very easy-going and inspirational movie.Amazing Kevin Coster in his usual role as coach but this time he is coaching a cross team( yes this isn't one with baseball and rescue swimmers). Relaxing movie for Sunday afternoon.
" An inspiring film about dreaming high
",2017-12-09 00:00:00,9,"McFarland, USA, is an excellent and inspiring film. One cannot help but see the film, a depiction of a true story, as a reflection of the American dream, and it is certainly that, considering that it is a story about a group of boys, living in an Hispanic farming community, who, with the help of their coach (Kostner) become champions in their field of running. Besides the warmth, humanity and principled aspect of the film, it touches on this contemporary subject of the American dream, can anyone actually live it, and of course, Kostner proves to these kids that they can. This dream is not only shared in America, it is shared by everyone, in every nation because the American dream is nothing more than the potential to dream high, and to have the opportunity to achieve it, and that message resonates throughout the movie. The ending is extremely touching - but no spoilers. The film should be required watching for any elected officials - reminding them why they are in office and who they serve."
" An Instant Underdog Sports Classic Made in Disney's Provocative Style
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,8,"McFarland, USA is a city in California that to this day has a sizable Hispanic population, many of whom work as migrant farm workers picking crops. ""McFarland"" is a film that tells the story of Coach White, a passionate coach who gets fired from his football coaching gig at a wealthy high school when he escalates a fight between him and his players to violence. The wealthy high school football players seemed more concerned about the after party than the game. Athletics for these players is a prestige thing that has nothing to do with sportsmanship. After a series of disrespectful actions, Coach White snaps and subsequently gets fired. But as Coach White reflects later to another coach when he arrives at his new school, ""It's not the fight in the dog coach, it's the dog in the fight...depends on the size of the dog..."".Coach White moves to Cliff Avenue in a Hispanic neighborhood with his wife and two daughters. When he first arrives in the new neighborhood, one of his daughters questions if the family had ended up in Mexico. The Whites struggle at first to fit into their new neighborhood. Meanwhile, the high school students in the small Hispanic town of McFarland have their own struggle. Most of the students at MacFarland have jobs. Athletics isn't even an option for many of them because they come from the fields to go to school and run back to the fields when class gets outs. Many become adults in those very fields. Unless a prison gets to them first. It is a hard life which stands in stark contrast to the lives of Coach White's previous students. He begins to see the athletic potential in his hardworking students and questions the temporary nature of his transitory job as coach at MacFarland. In the classic Disney fashion, Coach White's new community welcomes him. His neighbor even plants him a tree and tells him, ""in five years senor you're going to have some nice shade"". The simple transitions in the film show the migrant worker's lives with Hispanic music in the background. The scenes are poetic. But the most beautiful part of the film is the raw determination of the high school students trying to compete in a sport and environment that sets them up for failure. A boy named Thomas Valles becomes a de facto leader of the team after Coach White catches the high school student running at 12 miles an hour. This same boy shows up to practice with bruises because he gets his dad to punch him instead of a wall since as a migrant worker his father needs his hands to work. It isn't until coach White works a whole day as a migrant worker himself, picking crops getting paid by the field instead of by the hour that he begins to understand the plight of his athletes. In the spirit of Stand and Deliver Coach White understands that he needs to go beyond his position as coach for these students. He begins to treat them like his own. During one scene, he rushes to a park without enough money for the entrance fee and tells the officer, ""I've got five dollars and seven kids who have never seen the ocean"". He brings his students to the beach. Eventually, McFarland becomes more than a temporary home for Coach White and his family. It becomes their community, one which adopts them as warmly as they adopted it. The family moments such as the father's speech at his daughters quinceaÃ±era will tug at your heartstrings. Coach White disproves Thomas Valles' initial belief that, ""Nobody stays in McFarland unless they have to. Because there is nothing American dream about this place"". This film is based off a true story and Coach White ended up at McFarland coaching at the town's high school long after better prospects opened up for him. By the end, Coach White recognizes that these kids at McFarland cherish cross country and athletics, something he admits is a privilege many take for granted."
" Fantastic Must-See!
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,10,"The synopsis of this movie will probably make you think it's a cheesy Disney movie about a washed up teacher who makes a difference to his bad-boy students. It's not that movie. It's a fantastic, moving, inspiring tale that you'll want to buy and add to your collection.Kevin Costner plays a fired high school football coach with nowhere else to go but McFarland, USA, the poorest town in America in 1987. The kids there have no hope and no motivation, because before and after school they're out in tomato or lettuce fields helping their parents pick produce. They're not going to college; they'll become pickers when they graduate.Costner sees his kids running after school and comes up with the idea of creating a cross country team. With no funding, no support, and no clue what he's doing, he starts training the kids.The cross country portions of the film are exciting and fun to watch, but there's a lot more to this movie than the plot I just outlined. Costner and his family learn to make their new house their home, and this half of the film is interesting, tension-filled, and heartwarming. It's terribly sad to see the state of the town and how the poor residents survive, when the rest of America is thriving. Costner's character is unaware of their struggle when he first arrives, as most of the viewers will be, but as he gets to know his neighbors and bonds with the community, he (and we) are exposed to their cultural traditions.If you're not drawn to the movie because of the sports, or the inspirational story, or because you like true stories, or you like Kevin Costner, I'll give you one more reason to watch it: Maria Bello's costumes. I've never seen her look so pretty, and she wears the most darling outfits! But seriously, watch McFarland, USA. It's incredibly moving to watch how one teacher impacted a community and inspired a group of boys to look higher up than an agricultural field."
" Runner's high
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,8,"A coach inspiring a group of underprivileged kids to form a team to beat well-heeled rivals has been done before, but ""McFarland, USA"" does it well. Set in the 1980's, Jim White (Kevin Costner) takes a job as assistant sports coach at McFarland High, a mainly Hispanic school in Los Angeles. However the area seems too dangerous for his wife and young daughter, while scholastic achievement and prowess on the sporting field are not priorities for the students, many of whom work in the surrounding fields as pickers to help their families. However when White realises that some of his students are strong runners, he creates a cross-country running team to take on the wealthier schools that dominate the sport. Then as White and his family get to know the people in the area, they feel a sense of belonging, which they hadn't felt before. The film builds to an emotional, uplifting climax. Although a fair amount of rearranging of the facts took place, it is reassuring to learn that the story is essentially true. The film gets its message across without being preachy. At the end, when the actors segue into the real people, the theme behind the film becomes clear; if you can engage people and focus them on a goal and build self-esteem then they are more likely to become the citizens you want. This is a movie that sneaks up on you. Kevin Costner plays it low-key. One can see how an overly effusive approach to teaching would in reality have seemed fake to students wary of anything false. Maria Bello is perfect as Cheryl Whitel it's not a big role but she lifts any film she is in. Valente Rodriguez almost steals the show as the likable Principal Carmillo. Long distance running takes on an almost mystical significance in movies. Possibly the link with cross country-running, the endurance required and the sense of achievement it generates was one of the reasons nearly all the boys in Coach White's squad went on to lead meaningful lives. A football team or a baseball team would also have had a galvanising effect, but endurance sports are different â€“ it could have a lot to do with endorphins cutting in creating a natural high and great self-confidence. McFarland is a movie with a heart; it's a winner all round."
" A nice, sweet film
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,7,"I like the idea of a film about how sport can transform lives. Kevin Costner does well as Coach White, who starts training a troubled group of Mexican boys in cross country running. The film makes beautiful use of light and makes the flat fields of southern California look stunning. The film is refreshing in portraying Anglos and Mexicans as trying to get along. The Mexicans might be poor, but their community is close and loving. There is lots of gentle humour and a bit of the coach being a fish out of water. But generally, the outcome of this movie is not really in doubt. But it's a well written and heartfelt movie, about teenagers trying to improve their lot in life. The message is, there is no way around working hard towards what you want to achieve, and doing your best. And the support of being in a team is amazing. Sure, it's a bit of a schmaltzy film at times, but it has moments of genuine inspiration."
" Uplifting high school sports film
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"Hollywood has been good in one area a couple decades into the 21st century. It has turned out some very good sports films based on true stories. ""McFarland, USA"" is one. The movie was made by Disney in 2015, from a screenplay that was being developed since 2004. It's based on a true story of a high school teacher, Jim White, who made championship cross-country teams in the mid-1980s at a small California high school. The town of McFarland is in the farm area of central California, north of Bakersfield. The high school is largely Hispanic.Kevin Costner heads the cast as White, and all turn in fine performances. This is a very good drama, historical and biographical film. It is peppered with small doses of humor. The production qualities are superb. As with most such films, this one has been changed from fact to fiction in places. But, it tells a good story about a coach, a town and a high school team. Some of the fictional changes including White having been fired from different teaching jobs before going to McFarland. In reality, he began there in 1964 after he graduated from Pepperdine University. White taught different classes and grades until 1980 when he began coaching. When he noticed the speed of some of the kids, he decided to start cross-country running which the school had dropped the previous year. The film is just about the boys' team, but he started both boys and girls teams, and took both of them to the Cayucos beach during the 1985 season. White had three daughters, not two as in the movie. And they were older in real life. At the time of the cross-country championships, the girls were in college. The move was a hit and apparently led to increased interest in cross- country running in schools around the country. This is a good film that should be of special interest to young teens. Here are a couple of favorite lines from the film. Cheryl White, ""Fourth place? That's not too shabby. Jim, ""Four out of four â€“ also known as last.""Jim White, ""Tell your father I said it was an honor to be invited into his home."" David Diaz, ""Dad, he said it was an honor to be invited into your home."" Senor Diaz, ""Tell him I said 'Thanks!'"""
" ""McFarland, USA"" pleasant and effective
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"You've seen it countless times before. A non-traditional coach takes up a team of misfits and leads it to greatness. Did I mention that it's based on a true story? Disney has presented viewers with this scenario in several movies such as ""Glory Road,"" ""Miracle"" and ""Remember the Titans."" Despite this formula being overused and predictable, add in a great lead such as Denzel Washington, Kurt Russell or in this case Kevin Costner, and time and time again Disney will show you that it still works.Costner plays Jim White, a football coach with a bad track record in previous coaching positions. Following this incident, he and his family move to McFarland, California: a rural, impoverished and primarily Hispanic community. He starts his new job as the assistant football coach, as well as taking up the life science/PE teacher position. It is clear from the start that White does not want to live in McFarland, and will accept a better job if the opportunity arises.During PE class one day, Jim observes two Hispanic boys running laps. His daughter comments on how fast the boys run, and Jim notices the stamina that they possess. After continuing to watch them, he approaches the principal of the school requesting permission to start a cross-country team with these young men to compete in upcoming state championships.Coach White does more than simply coach a cross-country team, however. He invests in the lives of the boys and provides them with greater opportunities that would not have been possible otherwise. He also learns humility and the value of hard work from the guys on his team, who spend their mornings working in their parents' fields from the crack of dawn until they go to school.Costner does an excellent job in portraying the various struggles that Jim White endured to gain the trust of the guys on his team. Jim holds nothing back in guiding his team to excellence academically, athletically and as upstanding young men. The members of White's team, played by Carlos Pratts, Johnny Ortiz, Rafael Martinez, Sergio Avelar, Ramino Rodriguez and Hector Duran, are top notch as well.The film shows the hardships that the boys and their families faced as Latino migrant workers during this time period. The town and a majority of its families are plagued with a seemingly endless generational cycle of poverty, and their work is comprised of grueling, long hours with minimal pay. The writing by Christopher Cleveland and direction by Niki Caro adequately display this struggle. While the writing is solid, the film takes a little while to get going. The first 30 minutes of the movie leading up to White forming the cross-country team dragged on for me, however the information presented at the beginning is necessary build-up to the main plot, which is more than worth the wait. Overall, the direction by Caro is superb, and I am looking forward to seeing her future directorial work.The cinematography in the film is commendable. Most of the locations where the competitions take place include rolling hills and lush countryside in addition to a few urban areas. The enormous hills at the last location the team competes at are stunning to view from a distance, and the camera-work in the movie captures its beauty effectively.While ""McFarland, USA"" does not bring any original ideas to the table, the execution and effectiveness of the film is a pleasant surprise. Fans of Costner and sports movies alike will not be disappointed."
" One of the best sports dramas I've seen in a long time
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,9,"Niki Caro's ""McFarland USA"" is a film filled with pure heart and soul, dedication, determination, and pure inspiration, which this is a movie that is also based on a true story. The movie stars Kevin Costner as Jim White a high-school teacher who just got fired from his job as a football coach and takes up a job as a cross-country coach. After Coach White assembled a cross-country team the team isn't really that inspired at first, but then White pushes them to their real hidden potential so that they can perform as well as they can and how he would want them to in cross-country meets. With this movie Niki Caro who directed the movie really proves she knows how to direct a very well made sports movie. While I was watching the movie I was reminded of another sports movie called ""Remember the Titans"" (2000) which was made 15 years earlier with Denzel Washington in the leading role. I was reminded of that movie for two main reasons, the first one being because the things that coaches White and Boone are that when they started in their respective sports as the new coach in town everyone practically hated them and then came to respect them, and the second reason being that both White and Boone pushed them to their limits with their approaches being totally different with White being more laid back and encouraging, and Boone being tough and hard as nails, as well as being very strict. This movie also happens to be one of the best sports movies ever made. Kevin Costner gives one of the best performances of his career as a simple but flawed man who proved that his coaching skills were still good. This is a great movie as well as a near masterpiece that shouldn't be missed at all, and it is even a gem of a movie for all kids to enjoy."
