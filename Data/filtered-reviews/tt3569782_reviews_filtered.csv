" Bobby Simha will steal your heart
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,"When I first watched this movie I had zero expectations. I think that amplifies my love for this movie.Mainly, Bobby Simha stole the spotlight and all our hearts. Excellent acting, and makes you love him for him despite his rowdyism. His chaotic energy along with his henchmen brings loads of laughter at how insane they are. Brilliant acting, almost overtook Sidharth's acting. Still, good acting on all their parts.Cinematography and every frame was very beautiful. Loved the aesthetic and the artistic components of the movie - something lacking in many many tamil movies these days.Completely different feel from the other tamil movies being released these days. You'll love it."
" Marvelous

" A MUST WATCH !!
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,9,"Karthik Subbaraj who received unprecedented acclaim when he dished out Pizza (2012) as his directorial debut has served us a delicious drink in his second outing. Jigarthanda tells the story of a short filmmaker Karthik (Siddharth) who comes to Madurai to develop a script for his debut feature based on the life of real life don ""Assault"" Sethu (an excellent Simha). He settles down with his friend Oorani (Karunakaran) and attempts to profile the life of this ruthless gangster for his movie.The duo follow several leads and covertly try to get inputs from various associates of Sethu including some of his goons as well as Kayal (Lakshmi Menon) whose mother is an Idly vendor with Sethu as a regular customer. Though Kayal is smitten by him and even proposes to him unilaterally, Karthik, with his single minded intention of making his movie, merely pretends to be in love with her to access details about Sethu in the same vein that he tries to leverage the weakness of others.
After a series of quirky and hilarious twists, Karthik and his friend land in a monumental mess when they are caught red handed by Sethu spying on his activities. Sethu presumes them to be working with the police who want to finish him in an encounter. What follows is a roller coaster ride that keeps the viewer guessing with several surprises fused with the process of how Karthik manages to make his debut feature.Jigarthanda proves unequivocally that Pizza was not a mere flash in the pan and Karthik Subbaraj is an auteur to watch out. His skills in cleverly weaving a metamovie on the travails of wannabe directors within the fabric of what is a gangster flick on an apparent level are praiseworthy. The narrative is embellished with Tarantinoesque flourishes of raw violence and oodles of comedy even in sequences where they are least expected.
While Siddharth is impressive as the opportunist aspiring director with a singular focus who pays scant regard to manipulating others for his goals, Lakshmi Menon is convincing in an unconventional, albeit minor part of a smitten lover who could throw a spanner at her beloved's dreams when spurned. But, Jigarthanda belongs to Simha who nails the part of the dreaded psychotic don, ""Assault"" Sethu, oozing terror from his every pore. He straddles the entire emotional spectrum of this layered character from being ruthless and menacing to being darkly hilarious. His performance is the lynch pin of the movie and deserves several plaudits and awards that are sure to come his way. Karunakaran, as Oorani, is impeccable in his comic timing and goofy expressions.Karthik Subburaj's detailing is impressive - be it the pulse of the city that never sleeps (Madurai) or in the eccentricities of the minor characters. Santhosh Narayanan's score is brilliant and accentuates the intensity the proceedings. Although the songs may not be stand out chartbusters, that blend beautifully with the flow of the narrative. Cinematography by Gavemic U Ary captures the proceedings beautifully in resplendent tones.
Despite its self proclaimed tag of a ""musical gangster"" movie, Jigarthanda's ambitions are much more chimeric. It is also an effective dark comedy, a con movie and above all, an incisive satire on the state of Tamil cinema where the constraints of commercial viability continue to choke the creativity of aspiring filmmakers.Yet, at a deeper level, it is the metamovie where Karthik Subbaraj, appears to convey, through his namesake protagonist, through what could well be his personal experiences before succeeding in Kollywood, that despite these challenges, all is not lost for the filmmakers who could master these murky waters if they dare to remain steadfast in their focus and could smartly use their sails to navigate to the shores of success.
The movie is not without its flaws, especially the length which clocks a little less than three hours, resulting in some bit of drag in the second half. While it could certainly be trimmed by at least fifteen minutes, I felt it would be more of nitpicking as what was on offer was definitely delectable.Wildly imaginative, unpredictable and laced with loads of humour, this layered multi-ingredient beverage is a YUMMY offering from Karthik Subbaraj. A delectable & praiseworthy dessert to follow that delicious Pizza which whets our appetite for even more... Bring it on !"
" CONFUSING PLOT !
",2019-10-09 00:00:00,2,"I am a great fan of film and I watch all kinds of film from all around the world. This particular movie also crossed my mind and I watched it. It's a waste. I mean what the director of the movie was trying to do. The plot of the movie is confusing. Is it a gangster or comedy or a neo noir fantasy action. Really I still don't get it. If it was a gangster movie then the plot should been within the terror environment in which people lives but that is fully absent. It shows Sethu as a dangerous gang leader but the fear is absent from the movie. If it was a comedy movie then the plot about gangster is a waste. I was shocked when the plot turned comical when Sethu was displayed as a comedian and he finally turned his life from crime to acting!!!!. It doesn't fit in that way in real life my dear.
It could have been a good action movie with the available types of technical perfections but NO. The performance of the lead actor is not satisfying. Few things are good but wholly its irrelevant. The rating is 2/10 only for Nasser sir in beginning of the movie."
" The most overrated movie of this decade
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,4,Seriously! How did this movie got so much hype.... It's just an other comedy story with a low-key crime background. With a lot of flaws the movie just didn't concentrate on the main subject rather than showed some pathetic drama on some village gangster. This movie is an absolute replica of Poolarangadu ( a Telugu movie released in 2011)
" Short review
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,9,"This is definitely one of the best blend of humour,drama and crime. The way the story moves is very interesting. Will definitely make you laugh. The crime scenes is equally intriguing. Definitely a fresh one.
The direction and screenplay is perfect. Both of these made the movie refreshing.
The cast is very capable. They were used maximum in this movie.
The story is very unusual, and it is very nicely used in this movie.
Overall an outstanding movie"
" Needs a certain mindset to imagine this is a dark comedy although it isn't
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,5,"If you see a murderer, you run and report him to police, not employ him.
But it is only a movie, so you are supposed to brush it off and imagine it is some sort of a dark comedy where human lives are not important and a you are supposed to accept the murderer of several people as some semblance of a positive character. I couldn't, I have morals and compassion, I gave up after a few minutes into the nonsense of the acting role play by the murderer."
" Shame to have not seen Jigarthanda yet!
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,8,"It's a shame that I hadn't seen the 2014 film, Jigarthanda for so long! What a fantastic climax. Director-writer Karthik Subburaj weaves a story that will leave you on the edge of your seat till the end.Siddharth delivers a nuanced, measured performance. As an aspiring director, he showcases the excitement, vulnerability and relief when finally vindicated. The last scene with Vijay Setupathi is so perfectly staged.And what an endearing gangster is Bobby Simha. This quirky rowdy is relatable from the moment he enters the film. Again, flawlessly scripted by karthik Subbaraj.Santosh Narayan lifts the film to another level with brilliant background score and surprising classical music pieces in some scenes.Overall, thoroughly engaging and a must-watch."
" Jigarthanda (2014)
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,8,The film was very good. Bobby Simha acted very well in the movie. Even other actors also acted very well in the movie. Songs and BGM were also good in the movie. But some scenes are so violent.
" Karthik (siddharth) is tasked with making a brutal gangster film when he is challenged by a top director who is the judge of a reality show
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,8,"Karthik (siddharth) is asked by a producer to write and direct a brutal and realistic gangster film complete with violence. Karthik chooses to make a gangster flick about assault sethu (bobby Simha),a ruthless psychopath gangster. Trouble ensues when Karthik's plans to try to get close to sethu through his henchmen backfires miserably. Almost on the verge of getting brutally murdered,Karthik,having gotten within striking distance of sethu,finally reveals that he would like to make a gangster flick about sethu,to which sethu agrees. All goes on according to plan until kayal (lakshmi) sets everything in disorder,putting Karthik's directorial debut and career in jeopardy."
" One of the greatest gangster epics of all time
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,8,"4/5An aspiring director who wants to make a gangster epic that is different from the clichéd stuff, a brutal gang lord who becomes the subject of his fascination and who is also on the cross sight of the police and the rivalsthe aforementioned gangster's right hand who is a porn addict, but is a family man and a teetotaler, another who is a violent alcoholic and the third who irritates the hell out of people by telling them stories from his distant past; novice who wants to start his career in chopping up peopleSome of the most fascinating characters in crime genre populate this gangster epic and make the first half an incredibly enjoyable ride through the underbelly of Madurai.Unlike the usual gangster movies wherein the mole who wants to infiltrate the group earns the trust quite easily and just gets in, ""Jigar"" explores the efforts that go into this much overlooked aspect of such films. The second half is as diametrically opposite from the first as it can be. The denouement is real doozy and makes for a truly different, genre-crossing and rules defying visual experience.Bobby Simha, who plays the gangster, is the beating heart of this epic. He gets the role of a lifetime and dazzles the mind with his brilliance. He, deservedly, won the national award for best supporting actor.This is Mr. Subbaraj's second directorial venture (haven't seen his first, a horror movie, Pizza , which was remade in Hindi, too). He has written the script and the screenplay, too, and that is evident from the sure hand that he displays while helming this outstanding movie.A mandatory watch for any person who loves gangster films, both of yore and of modern times, this is available with English subtitles, on Hotstar"
