" A masterpiece with no expiration date
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,9,It is hard to find any flaws or weaknesses in this well thought and well done movie even after multiple times of watching.
" Fast & Funny Movie
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,8,"Fast, fluid, immersive, funny.. Primitive visual effects but that's OK. Quality acting and carefully tuned cinematography, conceal all the flaws. I loved camera angles. This movie will be remembered in my memory as a good and funny movie."
" Good!!
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,7,"Its a special type of movie!!enjoy it!
this movie have very nice actors and very very good genre!"
" So Beautiful
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,9,Every single shot was just so pretty and aesthetic. Wes did a phenomenal job. The movie is absolutely brilliant and it probably find myself rewatching it so grab any further details that i might have missed. So so good!
" Great Storytelling
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,The Great Budapest Hotel is a great example of story telling. In fact is it about someone telling a story (not to give too much away). The visuals and excellent acting make this movie one of my favorites.
" An excellent parody of classical film!
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,8,"By far the best part of this movie is the way it is filmed, every shot is deliberately placed to draw the audience and make it more believable of the set time period. The colours are bright and bold and bring the movie to life while still managing to create dark scenes. The comedy is excellent, it is one of the few occasions where visual comedy is used a lot and it works brilliantly. For those that don't know, visual comedy is when something funny is shown instead of simply telling the audience something, it works far better but is much harder to achieve. The acting is nothing to scoff at either. There are some big names in this movie, most of them having very small parts, it was a very risky move but I feel has worked in favour for the movie. The use of physical miniature models for the chase scene and others further emphasises the time setting but is also so deliberately and obviously fake that it becomes hilarious. The plot is alright and creates for some funny turns, the pacing is generally quite fast for the movie which can affect it in a perhaps negative way...I'm not sure how I feel about that yet. Some of the dialogue I found to be quite hard to follow due to the ostentatious language used by the upper-class individuals. Personally being only 16 I very much enjoyed watching a modern movie stylised to be more like older movies and enjoyed the movie as a whole. 8/10 bangs"
" Witty, Weird, and Funny
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,8,"Ah, my favorite fictional hotel. The story was very fast-paced. I was very hooked by the weirdness of the frame and the color of the movie. Among the star cast, Ralph Fiennes was the best part as he carried the movie with his charismatic personality and how fast he talked. Willem Dafoe as the hit man was also very fun. It's not his usual role, but he was quite menacing with his minimal dialogue and presence. I felt the story was not too fascinating, but the journey and the character interaction were enjoyable and entertaining. 8.5/10"
" Finnes Shines In What Is Perhaps Anderson's Best
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"I have long held a tumultuous disposition towards Wes Anderson's unique cinematic style. Cutting when the camera should pan, panning when the camera should cut, splitting his movies into chapters, and choosing distractingly vibrant color pallets, Wes tends to be a bit too flashy for my taste. Nevertheless, despite it still sporting all of these Wes-isms, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is an undeniable gem.Anderson's eighth feature, ""Budapest Hotel"" is a (double) framed narrative told over a 1968 dinner at the titular establishment. Aging hotel owner Zero Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham) tells an unnamed visiting writer (Jude Law) the tale of how he first came to the Grand Budapest in 1932 and served as a bellboy under the hotel's infamous then-owner, M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes).After M. Gustave's late mistress (Tilda Swilton) leaves him a priceless painting in her will, the family suspects him of manipulating or even murdering her. Rather than wait for the will to be verified, Gustave and a young Zero (Tony Revolori) decide to steal the artwork. What follows is a wild adventure involving bounty hunters, prison breaks, romance, friendship, and tobogganing down an enormous European mountain.For everything wonderful about this film, it is Fiennes who steals the show. Gustave is an enigmatic anti-protagonist. At times he is admirable and at others appalling, but for the audience, he is wholly entertaining. It is nonstop fun to watch Fiennes break from his regular villain roles to play this larger-than-life hotel manager, who nevertheless delights through comedic subtlety.Fiennes also has wonderful chemistry with the reserved yet stellar Revolori. It is not a funny-straight man match up, but rather a burlesque master-apprentice relationship where the master (Gustave) is undeniably the more ridiculous. Both characters are ""straight,"" but Gustave gets himself in more outlandish situations where watching him retain his squeaky-clean demeanor becomes a source of laughter.Outside of Fiennes and Revolori's dynamic duo, the regular Wes Anderson actors makes appearances. Willem Defoe, Ed Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, and Owen Wilson all pop up as expected. Meanwhile, Harvey Keitel has a brief cameo while Adrian Brody and Saoirse Ronan play more integral parts. It feels like a big, all-star Anderson reunion surrounding freshmen Fiennes and Revolori at the story's center.Moreover, I must admit that I even came to like the style in ""Budapest Hotel."" Unlike many of Anderson's other movies, this one takes place in the fictional country of Zubrowka. Therefore, I had an easier transition into Wes's Wacky World, willing to suspend disbelief and appreciate that I am somewhere outside of the familiar universe.With that in mind, I could better appreciate the film's artistry. Despite its rich colors and sounds, it actually reminded me of early silent pictures from F.W. Murnau or even Georges Méliès. The sets are unapologetically fabricated with miniatures, and the aspect ratio is archaically square. Given that the film's bulk takes place in the 1930s, this felt tellingly transportive. For the first time in a live action Wes Anderson film, I found myself deeply relishing in the director's artistic liberties."
" A piece of art that deserves its place in the cinema history books
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,10,"From the story to the acting, from the cinematography to the score nothing is forgotten it's a perfect picture"
" Enchanting production
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is truly something else. The aesthetic, camerawork, colours, characters, the most adorable interactions between these characters and the acting, all combined gives us this never seen before masterpiece. The whole time watching this I had a nostalgic feeling in my stomach. The feeling I would get as a child when reading a great book. I believe it is such because The grand Budapest hotel made me feel like I was reading a book. The movie was something only my adolescent imagination could made up when reading literature which can only mean this movie is clearly something of a dream."
" Great film but...
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,8,This is a a very well crafted film like all Wes Anderson's movies. THe only problem I always find is that they're predictable and carry the same tone throughout. No much room for surprises.
" A very special and funny crime comedy.
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,"I had only seen two Wes Anderson movies before I saw this one: Fantastic Mr. Fox and Isle Of Dogs, both animated. But The Grand Budapest Hotel has to be my favorite. The first time I saw this movie, I didn't quite understand it. But I at least thought it was funny. I wanted to rewatch this movie again for 7 months, and now I finally did. And now, I understood it more.Now, this is one of my favorite movies. It had some (probably) unnecessary scenes, but I laughed quite a lot. This is one of the most special and funniest crime movies I've ever seen.The cast in this movie is one of the biggest I've ever seen. Celebrities coming in as main characters, supporting characters and cameos. This is very fun. In the big leads of this movie, we have Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori. In other roles, we have Saorsie Ronan, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Jude Law, F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson amongst others. Wow! I'm giving a huge ""Thanks!"" to all the actors supporting this masterpiece. Especially Ralph Fiennes, an actor known for serious work in movies like Schindler's List and Harry Potter. Well, this is some of the funniest actor performances I've seen, not just from him, but from any actor.This is a funny and unconvential movie, that has some problems. This movie is a masterpiece. Enjoy!"
" Boring movie for arthouse junkies
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,5,"Not for those who watch for entertainment, you can skip this movie"
" A Masterpiece
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,10,"I just re-watched this on Disney Star and was reminded what a work of pure genius it is. From start to finish it is visual perfection, the performances are exquisite with Ralph Fiennes disgracefully overlooked at the Oscars.
If I allow myself to wax lyrical about Wes Anderson's superb piece of work then this would go on forever. So do yourselves a favour and seek it out if you like movies that are a feast for the eyes, senses and intelligence. 10/10"
" A well-made and well-made film
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,8,"This is a great movie with great cinematography starring Ralph Fiennes as Gustav and brilliant director Wes Anderson. In this film, we see an imaginary city with imaginary characters that are well watered. Be sure to recommend it. 8/10"
" Movie title should be ""Deep sleep video""
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,2,"This movie can put you to sleep everytime you want to. Poor story. Poor direction. Don't waste your time and money.
I watched this due to high ratings. I think everyone who suffered this torture wanted others to suffer so they rated it high"
" A Great Introduction to the Wonderful World of Wes Anderson!
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,8,"This is my first live-action Wes Anderson film. I have already seen ""Isle of Dogs"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"". ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is, quite frankly, a really fun movie to watch. Wes Anderson's visual style is a real treat. The characters are also very fun and interesting too. I like the story a lot, but I wish Dimitri got more screen time as one of the other villains of the film. The actual hotel is really well-designed. The story within a story bit is pretty cool as well. Wes Anderson's style is very distinct and impressive, I would highly recommend you watch this film if you haven't already."
" Whence came these two radiant, celestial brothers
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,10,One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I watched it because it was a Top 250 and I believe that it should be much higher on the list.
" a magic movie like a poem.
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,10,"This movie has amazing photography as a painting. Many scenes have humor. It is like a well-tuned clock, which works perfectly.it also has hidden meanings and messages for the evolution of man on a spiritual and cultural level."
" An extremely beautiful movie about friendship
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,9,Wow. Every single shot and frame of this film blew me away. Easily one of the best-looking films ever made. Don't miss this one.
" Not The Best But It Still A Terrific Piece Of Work
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,8,"""Maybe if you already watch some of a Wes Anderson movie or at least one you will already know the style of all of his film and that's why all the amazing cinematography and all of his things is not making me surprise anymore even though it still an amazing thing especially for you who watch Wes Anderson movie for the first time, i still like this movie but not a lot, i think the cinematography is amazing but like i said before not too impressed me anymore, the perfomance is amazing, the editing is amazing, the set is terrific, the music is good too, but i'm just not a big fan of the story, i don't know, the story it just pretty basic and nothing special, but overall The Grand Budapest Hotel is probably not the best Wes Anderson movie and i'm still picking Moonrise Kingdom to be my all time favorite Wes Anderson movie but it still a terrific piece of work, i highly reccomended"""
" Absolute gem
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,10,"I never thought I'd like this movie but it's charm, wit and dry humor won me over. Absolutely a wonderful gem"
" 8.7
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,8,"My mother recommended me this movie. I've never watched a Wes Anderson movie before but i've seen his work on some youtube videos and i find it cool to say the least. I appreciate his art but, unlike my friend, i didn't find my self in awe. Sure it was stimulating, and i enjoyed it very much. Was thinking a lot about what budget this movie had. Everything was very grand and there was a lot of attention to detail.
Cinematogrophy was outstanding and i'll give that a 10/10. I don't remember what my friend gave it for overall score but i remember he also gave a 10/10 for cinematogrophy.I enjoyed the great contrast between Zero and Gustave. Very beautiful.-watched with Tor yesterday!! (22/01/2021)"
" Every frame is a painting, but..
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,4,"Every frame of this movie is a painting, but I quickly found myself wishing for paint thinner. This movie isn't about anything. Nothing happens. It has no purpose, no direction, and no soul. It's boring and a waste of time, and I regret even renting it from Netflix except that it gave me the opportunity to come up with my ""paint thinner"" line, which I am proud of. It's like Goodburger, except instead of a burger restaurant, it's a hotel. And instead of being a good movie, it's a bad movie, and instead of burgers it's a guy or something. Imagine a TV edit of The Shining."
" The most perfect film ever
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,"I can rewatch this over and over and like fine wine it only gets better. It is my favorite film, and each time I watch it I am reacquainted with its quirky perfection. The script, the design, the pace, it's all so well done"
" brilliant
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,10,"Everything about this movie is stunning! Story, sets , cast, and the cinematography is incredible."
" Wasted my 1h 40m Lockdown time
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,1,Just go and sleep or read or do something else than watching this hyped movie.
" Good movie.
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,"It is a nice movie filled with love, friendship, trust, emotions. Do watch it."
" A masterpiece!
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,10,"This film grabbed my attention from the get-go with its quirky looks and fantastic cast. It's got a brilliant comedic side to it, along with an intriguing storyline and great performances throughout.This is surely Wes Anderson's best film, and I would go so far as to say, this is one of the best films ever made. Certainly one of the best films I've seen. Well worth watching! - 10/10"
" What a delightfull reminiscence of old times
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"A touching movie with well developed characters and a great script played by excellent actors. Very well spiced with drama and humor. Photography, stage and tricks are those of a great movie. The many quotes to the grand old days are perhaps even better understood for someone who grew up in Europe. A wonderful realization of an inspiration by Stephan Zweig."
" ridiculous
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,1,This is one of the most stupid movies I have ever seen. The $1 DVD from the op shop was a waste of money & it went in the bin after wasting my time trying to watch it.
" thats a wasting of time
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,1,One of the most overrated movies in the entire history
" A beautiful movie that you won't forget
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,9,"Saying that a Wes Anderson movie is beautiful is kinda unnecessary. The colors, the framing and the subtle details all make it so this movie looks like a series of paintings stitched together.
Nevertheless, the movie has substance to back it up. With quick and witty dialog, it makes you wonder where is it going, just to make a turn once you believe you got it.
It does fenomenal cinema without taking itself too serious, and, in the end, it is it's beauty that makes it such a masterpiece."
" Not only ""Symmetrical"" but also ""Cyclical""
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,"(modification of former review, please kindly change.)Impressive!! This masterpiece contains not only ""Symmetrical"" but also ""Circulation"", in the point of view of Classical Music - 'cyclic music', for example Berlioz, Saint-Saëns, Frank and so on. As shown it, Classical music composers, Gustave(Gustav Mahler), Dmitri(Dmitrii Dmitrievich Shostakovich), Ludwig(Ludwig van Beethoven) and Wolf(Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) appear Cyclically in this story. Are these conscious or not?"
" A suggestion to beautify the day
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,8,A film that leaves a hot chocolate taste in the mouth. The colors are used very well.
" Hospitable, Stylish, and Artistic
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,9,"Movie has Wes Andersen written all over it. The narrative style and pacing make tremendous impacts and its easy to get lost in the story. What it lacks in character development (specifically with the Lutz family) makes up for in visuals and the acting from Ralph Fiennes. Cinematography was great: the wide shots of the men walking through shadows, the Jeff Goldblum/William Devoe chase scene, the hotel shooting scene in the end and countless other examples. The beauty and style really give this movie width and breadth
8.5/10"
" like the film style and characters, very picturesque. art in every scene
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,8,"Just when you think thrillers can't possibly get more inventive, leave it to Wes Anderson to prove us wrong. It is without a doubt one of the greatest films of the 2010s and features wonderful performances from the entire cast with Ralf Fiennes giving perhaps his greatest performance yet."
" Checking in?
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,8,"Wes Anderson's quirky, Oscar-nominated 'The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)' is inarguably his best work. It's a thoroughly entertaining experience that's almost as funny as it is distinct. With its pastel colour palate, pseudo 'silent movie' sets and purposefully dry dialogue, the piece creates its own unique yet cohesive style that almost seeps off the screen. There's nothing quite like it. It's a tangible and twee little tale that constantly subverts expectation. It's often incredibly funny (a moment in a monastery is straight-up side-splitting) and it remains good-humoured from start to finish. It also packs a surprising amount of emotional heft, especially as it approaches its ending. It's just a fun time, really. It's chock full of spot-on performances, set-pieces and plot-points. It's great. 8/10"
" This film is a masterpiece
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,10,"The cast includes some of my favorite actors. The storyline, based on the writings of Stephan Zweig, is gripping. The script is well-written and funny. The costume and production design are exquisite. The photography is sublime. The color palette is lovely in pink hues, and has beautiful lighting. All these factors make this film an enchanting pop-up book come to life, which in no way trivializes the harsh realities of war, of loneliness, of greed; but instead, heightens the purity of kindness, and treats the subject with the courageous optimism of Fellini's ""Nights of Cabiria""."
" This is a special film
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely loved the movie, it was a wonderfull story with a well excecuted movie around it. Its different in a sence that the movie feels incredibly playfull yet mature in the same way. Lovely acting. And mostly of all i incredibly enjoyed the atmosphere this film was setting. To me personally it is a definite 10/10"
" A delightful and interesting movie!
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,10,"As we see this Wes Anderson's masterpiece, we become fond of it's characters and cinematography, the movie is filled with Anderson's trade marks that we love and can't get enough. The two main characters played by Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori have an amazing chemistry, even though Tony isn't a very experienced actor he can keep up with Ralph for the entire picture, I guess people just need an opportunity to prove themselves great, and he did it.
The thing that I found most enjoyable in this light comedy, was that instead of having those ""movie feels"", I felt like I was at the theater watching a 3 act play, and it was an amazing experience for me!"
" Catastrophe
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,3,What a mess ... the longest time I've ever watched something like this ... I cannot clarify but it all makes no sense
" Pure joy
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,10,"What an incredibly pleasant film. The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of those movies that just keeps on giving. It's as gorgeous and funny as it is heartfelt and lovely. As a matter of fact, I can't think of anything that I would've changed or liked to have had differently. I think that that's a pretty good indication of just how good this film is.I think that the most obvious thing about this movie is the visuals. Every scene, every set-piece and every shot is just magnificent. The movie is grand and colourful just as much as it's cosy and warm. Indeed I can't quite describe the feeling this movie gave me. But certainly, I was happy and grinning like an idiot for the entire run time.Then I need to talk about the cast. Like the movie as a whole, it just keeps on giving. As the film gets going I couldn't believe how many stars were in this cast. They were all introduced in great ways and I just kept laughing as more and more of them were revealed. For me, the stand out was Ralph Fiennes. He captured the mood of the film so perfectly that it felt like he was born for this role.Although I separated these two aspects of the movie, they are just parts of an incredible sum. Everything in this movie is just sublime. And when you combine all those sublime parts you end up with this masterpiece known as The Grand Budapest Hotel."
" Simply Extraordinary
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"I've never seen a film quite like this one. Really pulls you into the magic of this complex, incredible world. Thank you, Wes Anderson."
" What a wonderful movie!
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,9,"This is absolutely one of the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Everything look so perfect: direction, photography, editing, acting. The cast is full of star, but I want to make a special mention to Tony Revolori in the role of the Lobby Boy. This movie bring me in a spiral of emotions from the first to the last minute of it. I wish I could watch much more movie like this in my life!"
" Surreal.
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,9,"If there was one word to describe this movie it would most certainly be 'surreal'.This movie is unlike anything I have ever seen before. I honestly don't know how to categorise it, and I honestly don't think I can. The story, albeit hard-to-follow at times, is highly entertaining, and takes you on a very colourful adventure. The cinematography in this movie will forever make it one the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. The whole thing is coated in this... candy-coloured hue and of course you have the unmistakably Wes Anderson symmetrical shots. As a Brit I'm pretty experienced in the field of dry humour and therefore know that it's hard to do well, but this movie executes it to perfection.Absurd, entertaining, weird, incredible.-Sasha"
" I was so angry when this movie came out because
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,10,"Ralph Fiennes wasn't on the list of nominees for Best Actor for the SAG Awards and I therefore couldn't vote for him. At the time my party and I had just screened another nominee movie that sucked the soul out of our bodies. We finally shut it off and tried The Grand Budapest Hotel. It was like opening a large hardcover beautifully illustrated picture story book and jumping into that world. Ralph Fiennes was unrecognizable as M. Gustave. His mannerisms, inflections, and stylized acting carried this movie and this wonderfully witty movie, a breath of fresh air, revived our souls and through to the end, we were elated."
" My favorite Wes Anderson movie so far
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,10,The Grand Budapest Hotel is probably my favorite Wes Anderson movie so far. Not much more I can say.
" My Beloved Intro to Wes Anderson
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,10,"For those lucky enough to have been avid moviegoers in 2014, when it appears film was at its 21st century best, The Grand Budapest Hotel proved to be a diamond in the midst of emeralds. The plot seems simple: an aging hotel owner recounts the tale of how he went from refugee to wealthy property owner. Yet, the story is not so plain. Full of zigs and zags draped in regal costuming and set pieces, The Grand Budapest Hotel is arguably - no, definitively the most wonderful bit of cinematic expression from that year.The film stars Wes Anderson regulars, Ralph Fiennes, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Tilda Swenton, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, and Adrien Brody. But the great magnitude of traditional Anderson actors does not outshine our newest key characters Zero (Tony Revolori) and Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) who are remarkable as the young lobby boy and his inevitable bride.I am overwhelmed with internal frustration when thinking about this movie. I am afraid that never again will I see such a film. The vibrancy of the color pallet is undeniable. The enticing blend of humor, morose, and hope is inspiring. The rewatchability factor is at an all time high. There is simply nothing bad I can say about this movie. Wes Anderson has once again capitalized on his style of pastels and symmetry without becoming repetitive.I pray The Grand Budapest Hotel never leaved Netflix. I have watched it more times than I dare admit. For those who wish to learn about screenwriting and the fashioning of great characters, go out and buy the script. You will not regret it."
" Do not understand the strong praise
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,2,"After watching Moonrise Kingdom and not overly enjoying that film. Decided to give this other Wes Anderson film a try, as remembered seeing much high praise about it during its release.After watching the film, found it to be unfunny and not nearly as interesting or engaging as many others claim so. Do not understand the strong following for both of his films. At times was dozing off and became tremendously bored.The acting may be great but found the characters rather irritating and the dialogue just tedious and pretentious. This is a film which awkward to think it is smarter than it is, and for this sake could not get into it.The positives are the visuals and the acting but just did not care about the story and it feels longer than its 100 minute runtime."
" It's like a children's movie for adults and I love it.
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely love how the movie has a mature topic and has mature content in it, but is made like a children's movie. I absolutely love the use of symmetry in this movie, Wes Anderson is a genius! This movie is a must watch, and should be shown in film schools. I honestly have no idea how Wes Anderson is so creative."
" I enjoyed it greatly.
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,9,"Another masterpiece by Wes Anderson and it stays consistent within his style of strange, obscure movies and settings with characters so close to reality but at the same time far away. A must see, without a doubt"
" .
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,9,"It was very colorful and visually appealing movie with so many great shots. Although i even laughed several times, there was lots of violence which made me uncomfortable."
" Beautiful film
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,9,"Yeah not only was it beautiful in its colors and choice of scenes the main character was beautiful in his ideals and English refinement. A very strong cast here. The screen play was special and the directing was done just as special. Incredibly low budget of 25 million, not sure how they pulled that off."
" Great fun
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,7,"Wes Anderson's films are a bit of an acquired taste for sure, with his quirky characters, wide shots and pastel colours, and this is absolutely bonkers to the highest degree... but it also has buckets of charm. Ralph Fiennes puts in a phenomenal performance, and the film is utterly bursting with big names that sadly each only have minimal screentime. Willem Dafoe was brilliant as the psychopathic antagonist, and Jeff Goldblum was, well... Jeff Goldblum - but the film just feels like it's missing something I can't quite put my finger on. Perhaps it's the somewhat unsatisfying ending, or maybe it's the fact the humour doesn't always hit the mark... in any case it's an interesting and entertaining watch that fans of Wes shouldn't miss"
" Wes Anderson's best film
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,9,"This film was pure joy to watch. Wes Anderson has such an eye for detail. Every single shot, character, setting and prop is perfectly designed with a distinct style that permeates the entire film. The story itself is a great portrayal of friendship and loyalty with plenty of excitement, humour and intrigue along the way."
" Artsy, ludicrous and absolutely delightful!
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,10,"If ever there was a film that was difficult to pigeon hole this is it. It moves from the ludicrous to the sublime in the blink of an eye and left me thoroughly entertained in the process. Mr Gustav is superb, Zero is superb, this film is superb. It truly is a masterpiece and quite unlike anything else. Wes Anderson does what he does best in creating an image so rich and vibrant its impossible not to fall in love with it.

" More extra than guac at Chipotle!
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,8,"This movie was just too much!! But in a good way. It's not ""hilarious"" - it's entertaining. It's not beautiful - it's cinematic. It's a modern classic. It's a total mood of its own. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. Definitely worth the watch!"
" Would make a great operetta
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,8,"The Keystone Kops meet Victor Herbert. All that is needed is for everyone to break out singing every now and then and this would be a great operetta, a melodrama set in the fictional European Republic of Zubrowka. The single camera technique employed by director Wes Anderson (only moving side-to-side or front-to-back-to front) can become tiresome at times but generally maintains its role as providing a special feeling to this fairy tale. Anderson's style includes what film critic Judith Crist called the ""Hey there..."" technique. She was referring to biblical epics of the 1960s with many famous actors in bit roles. It applies here, for example: ""Hey there, it's Bill Murray!"" or ""Hey there, it's Bob Balaban!"" etc. Another frustration with the film is its fast pace and quick screen shots. There is so much detail in each setting that you want to feast your eyes on the grandeur (as well as visual ""in"" jokes). For that reason, it's best viewed as a DVD so you can back up and watch scenes over and over again"
" Another Wes Anderson Art!

",2020-08-09 00:00:00,10,"I came to watch this movie because of Saoirse Ronan. Never have I set any expectation on this except to see Saoirse Ronan. But oh boy this movie takes you to the edge of your seat in its own way.It's filled with diverse colors which metaphorically takes you to vast experience, action and adventure. It's vintage style adds more appeal to its delivery.A murder mystery film that never takes away the suspense when it's fun or the other way around but instead it gives more than what is necessary"
" Definetly an original.
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,7,"I find myself enthralled for the 1st half of the film, but always start drifting midway through. There's still funny scenes in the 2nd half. But a lot could have been left on the floor. I wouldn't have missed the entirety of the Dafoe scenes, and he was my favorite part of Life Aquatic. It's nothing against him."
" What a movie. Wes Anderson is the master.
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,8,"This is such a nice movie. Almost a weird fairytale. Everything is so dreamy and princessy. Such a feel good movie. I laughed a lot and it as fun to watch. Great, cinematography, production design and performances. Congrats to everyone involved."
" Fantastic Fast-paced Comedy

" Love the way this film flows
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,8,"I like this film. The camerawork and colours are nice, as expected from a Wes Anderson movie, and the extremely styled nature of the movie makes the stilted dialogue and weird characters not feel out of place. That is an issue I have with some of his works. It's fun, give it a go if you are new to his filmography."
" Taking Wes Anderson's Humour and Comedy One Level Up. Not hysterical but definitely Hilarious.
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,7,"The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) :
Brief Review -Taking Wes Anderson's Humour and Comedy One Level Up. Not hysterical but definitely Hilarious. I didn't expect such wild and crazy humour from any film of 2010's decade and here comes a complete shock that brought smile on my face instead of a frown. It's a freaking crazy heck of a ride that doesn't give you a chance to lose interest throughout 99 minutes. What makes it such a good going thing? It's Writing, Acting and Direction. Three strong pillars of this Humongous and Lavish Hotel hold the burden of expectations quite well. It may not make sense sometimes but it ain't got any loopholes or uncertain spams in the writing. After a slow start and losing 12-15 minutes before the main character's arrival, this film tunrns into a hilarious sighting from which you get an adult, spoofy and capricious humour. Ralph Fieness as Mr. Gustavo is as crazy and spontaneous as you can expect. The dialogue delivery by him makes the humour look even more whimsical. Tony Revolory brings cute dumbness through his character and the elder version of him is maturely played by F. Murray Abraham. The supporting cast is brilliant in every scene and every provided situation. The Grand Budapest Hotel has got a pacy storytelling because of which even some mistakes goes unseen. But not to forget the screenplay has so many variations and so many different funny situations placed and sown at right occasions. Wes Anderson has taken his humour and comedy level Up which certainly makes one strong reason to recommend this film. The other 2 reasons are of course Acting and Writing. It makes a rare combo of Crime, Thrill, Drama, Adult Humour, comedy, tragedy, war, fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty etc. so add it in your watchlist if you are looking for any of these ingredients.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest"
" Bravo!!
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,10,"Throughout the movie, I felt how happy it was to be with great actors. It feels like I'm eating hot and delicious rice soup after a long time. The satiety drew a smile around my mouth."
" A movie worth watching
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,9,"I recommend this movie to anyone . It's very funny, dramatic and the directors did a great job on making it a great movie."
" A movie or a painting?
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,10,"A visual masterpiece, Wes Anderson took his style and critics and went to the next level, and doing what he does best, make movies that feel like movies. this film serves as painting, the visual style is a narrative on its own, accompanied by the story narrative. These two narratives correlate to create this ultimate, immersive, graphic, and evocative stream. it's a story, inside a story, inside a story, inside a story, and each story is loyal to its period's popular aspect ratio ( yes the changing of aspect ratio has a meaning), it's a perfect comedic tragedy wes took from the comedic language oof twenties and thirties cinema and gave it a twist of modernity. Emotions are conveyed with colors, light, and mise on scene techniques rather than poignant dialogues or melodrama, and it worked perfectly. This film touches the spectator on a sensual level, it's engaging and makes you wanna dive in its world. in general, it reminded me of the euphoria I felt when I watched movies as a child. it's definitely Wes Anderson on steroids embracing nostalgia and fighting tyranny with irony, frivolity, and unshakable charm (hens the ZZ is a hint to the dutch SS). a perfection and one of my fave of all times."
" It's great
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,8,"That's awesome! Each frame can be made into a postcard. The score is great, too. This is called a movie, the extreme enjoyment of hearing and hearing."

",2020-06-19 00:00:00,10,"Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot.-- Charlie ChaplinAs a comedy film ""Budapest Hotel (The Grand Budapest Hotel)"", appears to be a quirky comedy world, but it is filled with a little sad, of course, there is no denying The fact that The film viewing process is pleasant and smooth, but always have a lingering falls lingering in my mind, can be said to be The nostalgia for bygone era, also can saying is The humanistic spirit of festivals, also can be said to be The good feeling for The volatile, when there is ""inspired by zweig"" until The end, finally clear The sad reason.

" A Unique and Original Classic
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,10,"TGBH is one of my favourite films ever.It's aesthetic is visually pleasing and colourful which makes every scene a joy to watch. Furthermore, when paired with the very fun score from Desplat it gives even the most quirky scene a hint of suspense and tension (such as Deputy Kovac's run from Jopling).Its dark tongue in cheek humour is perfectly timed and not too overdone.The plot is very complicated but certainly not impossible to understand, however this wonderful film is one to entertain, rather than to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat; therefore I would recommend to a first-timer to try and enjoy it rather than to try and keep up and figure out the story.It is a shame that Wes Anderson did not receive any Academy Awards for this masterpiece."
" A cinematic blast!!
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,8,"Wow I really enjoyed this movie! The cinematography was just soo good in this film! The set design for the hotel looked so good. Everything looked so satisfying in this movie!
This is my first wes anderson movie soo I of course figured it out that it was a little weird.
Anyways this was a blast to watch with some great actings and I had a shock while famous actors were in there too"
" A total waste of time

" a brief evaluation
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"A film, if classified as a comedy, will at least taste sweet, no matter how dark it is at the core.
If contemporary American scams are the equivalent of an American milkshake, the grand Budapest hotel is definitely a raspberry pie, with a floppy pie base and a rose-colored mousse topped with a fresh layer of raspberries. It's the one you look back at when you walk past a dessert shop window."

",2020-06-06 00:00:00,7,"It's a long movie, even if it lasts less than 2 hours. That's the short review. But seriously, it's a fast-paced film that got tedious because of the excessive amount of, mostly rhetorical, speech. I know the movie is a narrative, but it does get boring after a while. The plot is full of turnovers and twists. With many big names on it, the cast, make the movie worth being watched once and, sometimes, makes us laugh. The art direction and production were a case apart, it was great."
" I have seen this 8 times, and show all my friends
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,10,"While this is for school to get extra credit, i enjoyed writing this review and this movie.
Wes Anderson's off key writing and directing creates a wall between those who like his movies, and those who don't. I am part of the group that adores his movies. However in the turn of the 2000s, his directing took a more ominous turn. Instead of a cute and pretty style, it turned unhuman, harshly colourful, and unappealing to some. However when mixing together all the weird cameras, actors, and story it creates the wonderful The Grand Budapest Hotel.The Story seems to be rather mundane compared to high actionpacked movies, even if I summarize the movie it would seem boring and slow. I agree, the plot is rather boring. Through my first watch-through it felt like a 2 hour movie. But I was charmed by the quirky colours, camera, and writing. The acting brings out the joy and antics of the movie. Paired with beautiful cinematography, lovely colours and environments.My favourite part of any Wes Andersn directed film is the disconcerting acting. The way they talk and move almost seems inhumane, but still conveys the emotion, and deep connections of human nature. While unusual, and often disliked by some. The charming nature of the speech and emotions of character allows you to form connections, even in a fleeting movie. Zero is by far my favourite character, his quirky yet passion for his friends shows through the whole movie. To explain Zero's character in a word, I'd say dedication.While Wes Anderson's movies contain subtle 'political' commentary, The Grandbudapest Hotel contains a more prevalent one. Zero came from a town that was taken over by fascists, and fled in search of a home. Acceptance, solace in a world of chaos, is the moral of the movie, and the beautiful relationship between Zero and Gustave tears at the heart of everyone, even if they didnt love the movie. ""His world had vanished long before he ever entered it, but he certainly sustained the illusion with a remarkable grace.""While the acting is my favourite part, the cinematography is beautiful. With vivid colours, wonderful environments, and beautiful shots there isn't anything bad I can say about it. The best thing I can say is, watch this movie. If not for the actors, story, commentary, watch it for the wonderful artistry of the camera.
My favorite scene can be watched spoiler free. It contains the wonderful quirky-ness, fun editing, camera, everything I loved.
My Favorite Scene
However the movie did not contain many women. None of them are main characters, and usually the women are played for jokes, such as Gustave's many older women lovers. The exception to this is the baker's girl, Agatha, who was just a love interest of Zero. This is my only complaint, and I wish there could have been more women prominent.If you can't tell, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of my favorite movies. At the end of this overly positive review, I rated it 10/10."
" A complicated movie
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,8,"M. Gustave also admires the fact that he can insist on being himself in any environment, and his heart will not be swayed by the environment. All the experiences he will feel are just experiences, leaving no trace of change on him"
" The magic of framing
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,9,"From the first general shot that the film opens, we realize that Wes Anderson takes great care of the frame, which predominates totally in this work. Each shot is cared to the millimeter, in absolutely the entire film we delight in an absolutely stunning cinematographic frame, perhaps too perfect. The static camera with lateral and panoramic movement predominates in general shots that serve not only to tell the story, but even more, to locate the viewer in the context of the characters. Protagonists that Anderson repeatedly places in a painting within the painting or in a circular vignette, making sure that the attention does not leave what is intended to be shown.
And just as he perfectly handles the framing, Anderson also manages to mix or honor different genres, like musicals, comedy, or even silent movies, making it totally work.
We are probably facing one of the most aesthetic films in recent years. Wes Anderson manages to innovate and achieve a fun story with the great success of the frame, which totally steals the attention with its vibrant colors, bright settings and magic that stands out at all times."
" This is not just a movie
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,9,"This is not just a movie, it is a game, a fairy tale, or a piece of art, which perfectly combines the author's aesthetic style, form and nostalgic theme! Regardless of the story, play, theme and aesthetics, its recognition is only for yourself. For fans of Wes Anderson, this is a masterpiece!"

" Wes Anderson Catering to The Wrong Crowd!!!!!
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,1,"Yes, Grand Budapest says Wes Anderson all over it... I've been watching Wes Anderson films from the start and with each film, he loses the human aspect along the way, one after the other. It's almost like his ALL STAR cast becomes suppressed and in anticipating their performances you'd hope to see, but instead falls flat. They just become ordinary people to be honest.Yes, Wes Anderson is praised for having hyper attention to detail in his scenes (which is appreciated), but do you watch a movie to see how organized a bookshelf is in the background? Wes Anderson feeds into these praises for his great attention to detail and sticks to it and then keeps refining it to where his films have fallen off for me. I think he forgot about the rest of us who liked him for being ""unique enough"". Since Moonrise Kingdom, he's gone too far off that I could not appreciate a decent story because it focused too hard on small details that was unnecessary to pay attention to. I'm sorry, but someone has to say it, after watching the trailer for The French Dispatch... I already know what street Wes Anderson took. Yes I want to watch it, but it's only because i'm looking for that next Royal Tenenbaums or Rushmore. However, I'm afraid he's too far past those stages now.I'll say this, one time I found myself among Wes Anderson fans at a Halloween party and we all went around claiming our favorite film of his and our least favorite... Honestly, we all had different answers because each film struck different heartstrings, which made each of his films equally appreciated. Now, that's the big question, which Wes Anderson film is the best and which is the worst? I saw The Grand Budapest in theaters with another fan of Wes Anderson and we both struggled following each detail of the movie because overall, it was not necessary to pay attention to all the small details and the overly did narrations. It's really cool to have a visually aesthetic backgrounds or scenes, but to say ""hey, look how cool the set is, focus here."" It shouldn't steal the attention away from the storyline. It's not a psychological thriller where we need to know if some detail in that scene will affect the story down the line.To put everything simply, at first I felt like Wes Anderson catered towards extroverts and the introverted characteristics followed slightly behind. Now, I can say his films are more introverted, they make you look, think and analyze each scene, but oh and look Bruce Willis... oh well... its cool he's in this movie... Wes Anderson needs to come back to a balance I think. Some of these Directors have a climax and peak in their career, I'd say maybe some of Wes Anderson's older fans would agree that he's past his peak. Like M. Night. Shyamalan, who focused too hard on making an epic twist in his films, he fell off over time ( but took the time off and is due for a comeback, hopefully).Wes Anderson will get the praise for his symmetrical scenes, quirky humor and very cordial character roles. Of course, Wes Anderson fans will say after each film, ""yep thats Wes Anderson."" However, I refuse to be blind and say that's okay or say what else would you expect from him. There's a niche market, but Wes Anderson has gone Hyper-niche. I could introduce one of his earlier films to any of my friends or family and they could get into it and would likely enjoy it. Although, I feel like with his later films, I have more difficulty to pulling in someone brand new rather than someone who's already exposed to his style. That's the huge difference with old vs. new Wes Anderson and so I'll rest my case there."

" pretty good
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,"The movie was really beautiful at first glance. Every frame is like a picture, which makes people forget about it and tells the story. The deaths of the characters in the play are all taken in one stroke, without much rendering, like a long stream flowing slowly. If you don't understand the life of the author of this work, it is actually very suitable for watching at afternoon tea, beautiful scenery, and telling stories. When you understand the reality that you feel too heavy, you cannot watch it with a relaxed attitude. But Gusta in this movie let me know the exquisite life, and I want to eat a little cake."

",2020-05-07 00:00:00,10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) - [10/10]I've spent a long time trying to word this review... and I can't. This film is amazing. It's spectacular. Every little thing about it is perfect (aside from a few continuity errors, but I only first noticed them on my fourth viewing) much like the exquisite mise en scène. It is beautifully written, masterfully directed, and wonderfully executed. I have nothing but compliments for The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014), so I'll keep this review short. With excellent production design, spectacular performances, and camera movements and shots that fill you with satisfaction, this film is a cinematic experience and masterpiece. It is rewatchable. It has small significant details that you won't notice until a second or third viewing, so it makes each viewing a new experience. Everything is perfect, just like Wes Anderson's symmetrical framing. Like the imaginary Mendel's Courtesan au Chocolat delicacies, The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) is a delightful treat that you will not be able to get enough of."
" A mosaic of grandeur
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,10,"After watching hundreds of movies, you naturally forget some of them. This is a one almost impossible to forget, packed with adventure, comedy and drama.When I think of Wes Anderson I see colors, symmetry and visual aesthetics. Grand Budapest Hotel is Anderson's aesthetic in a nutshell, and I could watch it again with muted dialogues just to admire the scenography. All the colors add a pleasant vibe to the story but don't make it overly cartoonish.The pace is slow at first, but don't let it fool you. As the actual plot of Zero's story begins, we see chase and fight sequences so good they could be in an action movie. Not to mention the numerous themes that are present throughout the story - and there's a whole lot. Friendship, loyalty, romance but also war, nostalgia and loss.Overall, it's not a movie, it's an experience. A story that's almost never-ending, because you can watch it again and relive it, and it will feel just as good as the first time."
" Very dated
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,5,"I was watching this film , after greatly anticipating seeing it. Well, the corny narration and ZOOM IN'S really caught my attention. Where have I seen this before? Oh yes, The Royal Tananbaums.. It's a great story but ruined by this old style archaic way of shooting film. What's with the narration? Also,, the whole ZOOM lens thing.. very early 60's. One of the first things I learned in film school was the zoom lens, was invented,, and suddenly everyone started ZOOMING IN AND ZOOMING OUT. Until it was realized that it simply doesn't work. Film should reflect what the eye sees. The zoom does not reflect this. I found this film hard to watch, and horribly dated, even though it's brand new."
" Not really grand.
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,6,"It's nice! Starting interesting, it develops misteriously but at half point it becomes obvious and thus tedious. The story reveals itself far too soon and the engaging mistery leaves room to excessive absurdity and indulgence. I would say it is still enjoyable, worth giving a try. Overall average in its content, though marvelous in the scenography and audacious in the choice of characters. I wouldn't suggest it and neither advise against."

",2020-04-26 00:00:00,8,"Wes Anderson keeps evolving and it's beautiful. The storytelling, the use of backgrounds, foregrounds, the sets, its like its own world! One thing I like about this movie most is the positions of each character in a shot is very locatable even if its a chaos going on in the scene, this is the most ""Wes Anderson"" movie till date."
" Wes Anderson at his finest!!
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,10,"My introduction to Wes Anderson. I was entertained throughout the whole runtime, and I was invested in the characters, even though it might be hard at times to find the story believable in our reality. The characters are not written as ordinary human beings, but still, you find the humanity in them and connect with them in ways you wouldn't expect. The music is fantastic and the cinematography is beautiful, which is especially appealing due to the various aspect ratio changes that Wes uses throughout the picture, as well as the gorgeous color palette. Highly recommended if you want to see Anderson's unique style shine at its finest. I am eager to rewatch it already."

" A Visual Treat and Delight for Movie Lovers
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Wes Anderson is one of my favorite directors. It is his unique taste in portraying his movies which makes him stand apart.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is also one of his master creations.Describing the title of the movie itself, it has been said that the Grand Budapest Hotel was a picturesque, elaborate and once widely celebrated establishment and around this very hotel revolves our story. It is about the adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge between the wars and his favorite lobby boy Zero Moustafa, who turns out to be his protége, his companion, his brother and also his sole heir. The story gains pace and interest when one of Gustava's close friend and client dies and leaves her priceless Renaissance painting to him. The battle for an enormous family fortune begins hence-- all against the back-drop of a suddenly and dramatically changing scenario. The war has its own role to play in the story.The narrative enthrals and mesmerizes the audience with the story. There's not one shot that seems dragged or uninteresting. According to me, the portrayal of the characters are the most important in this movie. How each character holds their personality till the end is remarkable.The movie's visuals are very charming. Certain frames look like paintings. If you are observant enough, you'd see shades of one particular colour in each of these frames, especially pink. This is one of the things about Wes Anderson's movies. He is very artistic in the way he portrays his movies. His approach is minimalistic, colourful and symmetric.In short, I would definitely recommend you to watch this movie and have a good time."
" Funny and visually wonderful
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,8,"Great acting with great comedy and outstanding visuals and storytelling, I even got Citizen Kane vibes on some scenes. A perfect movie for entertainment purposes and for a family session.
Highly recommend it!"
" Bizarre, intelligent, good-looking, witty and poignant ""cartoon"" that isn't...
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,8,"At some point in Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" - when you get past the shock or surprise of the strength in depth that is the stellar cast present here (often only briefly) - you'll realise that you are watching a movie whose look, brilliance, storyline and way of highlighting things most likely owes more to the cartoon than film-making.And of course the cartoon emerged out of history to allow people to say strong things about the world and what is wrong with it in a funnier, perhaps lighter way.This piece is no exception, but it's a flawed masterpiece - as so many are. In the first place, it takes the risk - a serious one - that many a viewer is REALLY going to say ""why should I care?"" And this is a danger that arises as easily 70 minutes in as at the start. The film is so surreal and so much of a pastiche that again and again one is tempted not to care. What held me in for the duration was the AMAZING visual side and the obvious fact that somebody in there was actually trying VERY hard with all this.But - BE WARNED - you'll probably ONLY get your deepest feelings about this work a few minutes before the credits roll, and that's a mean way to treat an audience. Big SPOILER then, for the sake of encouragement - if you're like me, you'll suddenly realise (if the title doesn't make it clear) that you have been watching some kind of extended metaphor for the cruel things that happened to the Eastern Bloc from the 1930s through to the 1980s. And indeed those final credits roll - paradoxically - to an AMAZING Russian balalaika theme tune from a very gifted Alecandre Desplat.You might need this injection of depth from me, because at first glance the eccentric and overtly-""meaningless"" story presented about employees in a hotel of fading glory (at moments facing challenges of war and oppression) will look sharp and funny-ish, but in the end also dullish. And at times just too incongruous to live with. Who knows if we are looking for any ""reality"" in this movie? But if we are, then the delicacy and elegance and fastidiousness of Ralph Fiennes's starring character M. Gustave DO NOT correlate with his frequent resort to four-letter words. The 1930s were not like and a character such as his was not like that. And so this looks like an absolute own-goal from the makers, or indeed like a deliberate attempt to repeatedly shock us out of taking this thing seriously or treating it as anything other than an artificial arena.Don't know about others, but I (probably) don't actually come to a film to be slapped in the face repeatedly. This work seeks annoyingly often to bury sentiment under crude farce, even though it's ultimate goal is actually really and truly a sentimental one. Why do that? It looks awfully like deliberately hurting your own fans and followers...For all that, ""Hotel"" may offer you an experience you've rarely had elsewhere (conceivably a bit in, say ""The Lady Vanishes"" (1938)). Some may even concede that they've NEVER seen anything quite like it.And there must be SOME merit in that...!"
" The tragedy of the era
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,9,"At first, I thought it just told a story of legacy dispute. Then, I found there exised love and friendship beyond the country, culture and values. Finally, I realized that behind this story the dark clouds of politics and war always hung over it."
" Unique film!
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,10,"This is the first Wes Anderson film (director) I've watched. I had it in my watchlist, because it looked unique & humorous from the trailer.The 1:1 aspect ratio, its artistic direction and its colorful images make the film look like a mixture between miniatures and paintings... very enjoyable to watch. Even only for its unique visuals I suggest movie-lovers to watch it. I really enjoyed the funny elements here and there too. Ralph Fiennes plays a major role in that. He's great! Often I was wondering: Is his character making fun of the person he talks with? Or is he plain serious? Is he just trying to lighten up the situation? An interesting and likeable character.Furthermore, the music accompanied the film perfectly, as a great music composition should do.Overall... what a story! It is indeed unique and I'm glad I watched it!"

",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"Like a warm cup of hot cocoa, so sweet but not frivolous, many lines and jokes are intended to point to, but also natural, not stiff. At the end of the film I saw the director's tribute to Zweig, and my tears fell."
" The Grand Budapest Hotel
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,7,"Not much revealing about the plot the film is based on a journey which centers around the Grand Budapest Hotel. The film is narrated chapter wise showcasing the 20th century European culture. Many critique has written that this movie is the best Wes Anderson directorial which can be true as the film was nominated for several categories in Oscars including best movie. However for me the best thing for which I personally recommend you to watch this movie is its cinematography and the cultural portrayal of old Europe for which I would specifically like to mention Robert Yeoman the cinematographer for doing his job fabulously and it should be watched once, as far as for rest of the movie I would say that it is more of a Drama rather comedy with some long list of solid and seasoned cast. If you are an art lover then this movie is a must watch for you"

" On the establishment of an independent illusion world
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Watching ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is like pushing a layer of secret doors into a parallel world of real history carefully driven by memories of emotions. Through the vocabulary of this world, we see the thrilling resistance and self-struggle of the weak human civilization under the ""barbarous slaughterhouse"".
Narrative structure
""Symmetry"" aesthetics not only appears in the composition, but also uses a loop-lock structure in the narrative. Tombstones, young writers, conversations between young writers and old Zero, and Zero's memories are repeated in reverse after the memories are over, like piling up precious gifts layer by layer. After attracting people into the play, the spirit that naturally throws people in the world of illusion is guided away. The subtle realization of the ""purification"" effect of Aristotle's ""tragedy"" gives people an excellent and satisfying impression.
Narrative rhythm and audiovisual language
The unique narrative rhythm of the film and audio-visual skills jointly build this independent world. The ubiquitous sense of rhythm creates an unexpected comedy effect, and the serious theme and a serious line of content constitute drama irony. The actions and expressions of the characters, like stop motion animation, enter fast-forward mode when in motion, but also play an extremely prominent and accentuating role when at rest; if the former brings overall ease and humor, then the latter creates a stream of water The rugged rocky reef lurked in the fortress, and was hit at the climax.
Abnormal colors such as pink and the overall dream-like toning atmosphere are spread in the guiding composition; the music is relaxed and eager and has a certain era style. These three are unified in the creative impulse and personal style of the director under the strong emotion of recollecting that particular historical period, which maximizes the illusion of the general 's film and counteracts the reality of setting the world. . For example, Mr. Gustav took a deep breath and leaned slightly after a close-up lens with a side face. The rhythmic and psychedelic music sounded, and the main character walked through the screen with the same rhythm. . This means that Mr. Gustav enters his service role, and also means that the audience enters the specific world constructed by the director.
create character
An important pillar supporting the unique stylized presentation of this film is the symbolization of characters. The placement of the nickname ""Killer"", Zero's ""doorman"" identity throughout, and Mr. Gustav is the embodiment of the classical European noble culture. Behind the story of the encounter between Mr. Gustav and Ozawa Roze, it shows the survival and reaction of a certain spiritual form in a certain environment-a bit similar to the ""scenario"" concept proposed by Mr. Sartre. ""The world maintained by Gustav has long since passed away. He relies on strong personal charm to maintain this illusion as much as possible"" is the most obvious expression. The film constructs the character itself through the various reactions and habits of the characters in the whole story, and let him die together with the story.
Stepping out of the story and looking back at the Budapest Hotel, which has become synonymous with depression, loneliness, and perseverance, the last curtain of the classical aristocratic culture came to an end."

" The Grand Anderson Film
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,9,"The best way of describing The Grand Budapest Hotel is an art piece; all thanks to the film's stunning visuals due to the auteur, Wes Anderson.The entire film is so mesmerising due to its unique and artful framing, be its use of: wide shots which are often accompanied with great puppetry work adding so much charm; symmetry being utilised to make many shots looks like a painting; and or the change of aspect ratio between decades which, in combination with the use of dull and bright colours, makes it easily distinguishable and engaging to watch.The writing was also exceptional, balancing its witty comedy while still maintaining some of it's dark undertones. All the main and side characters had great personalities with all their respective actors giving their full efforts. Ralph Fiennes absolutely killed his role giving a lot likability presenting very memorable lines with an equally memorable performance.The runtime is justified with every scene always serving a purpose and in combination with it's fast paced dialogue keeps its pacing sharp, keeping me on my toes until its end."
" Ralph Fiennes' Best
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,8,Wes Anderson made great picture and of curse that was Ralph Fiennes' Best Performance. I enjoyed of the story that was very good one and I always like the way a narrator narrate the story. and of curse it was quite an Adventure. 99 minutes movie with great dialogs and I liked almost every single line of it.
" Humanity in times
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,9,"The film is a reminder of those bygone times. Those naive yet ignorant, prosperous yet shallow, but rich human times. Like Europe before world war ii, like France and the United States in the 1960s, like Japan during the taisho period, like our brief republic of China and the 1980s. It is the spectacle of a culture in transition from old to new, the fever and dream of history. Although ludicrous and unrealistic, but always see all better than the later era of harsh and cold - in revolution, or creed, or national, or development, or democracy, or consumer, or personality, or liberation of all kinds of banner, pretend or frustrated, or passionate, or serious, or center, or understanding, but his bones was traced to sophisticated and calculating."

It's been on my watch list for a while and today I finally decided to watch it, This first 30 minutes of this film I was both in awe, and laughing my guts out. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, I found it surprisingly funny and compelling. While I do feel the story falls apart a bit, I still found this movie a lot of fun. Watch it if you're into other Wes Anderson films."
" Great filmmaking
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,9,An old man tells his story to another man about his early years as a lobby boy at The Grand Budapest Hotel in 1932. What you get is a very quirky mad cap caper film that is highly entertaining and very funny. Ralph Fiennes plays the consierge who is the lobby boys mentor. Ralph puts in one of his best performances he is very funny and spits out lines in a very witty way. This film has a great ensemble cast and has some great lines and set pieces. I loved the production design and costumes. I really enjoyed this film. Highly recommend it.

" A Great Adventure and funny with a touch of Nostalgic sadness
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,9,I loved this film but I can understand that some people could easily dismiss it as just a farce/caper story. Wes Anderson fans who seek his story quirks and eccentric characters and people who are willing to immerse deep into the world of The Grand Budapest Hotel will feel the romance and nostalgic sadness of a bygone era. A time when magnificent hotels were built to cater for the boom of grand travel around the first half of the 20th century.
" One of the best movies by one of the best directors
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,9,"A joy. The saga of the Grand Budapest and its concierge. There is nothing like Ralph Fiennes in a comedy. It's really the saga of the concierge and his lobby boy. The two of them embark on adventures right out of a spy novel. One of the concierge's women is found dead, murdered. He inherits a million-dollar painting from her. He is accused of the murder. He is imprisoned. He escapes. A wonderful chase and gunfight ensues. Well, it's all wonderful."

" A true sensual masterpiece
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Wes Anderson is an artistic genius disguised as a storyteller. Period.In The Grand Budapest Hotel he presents a moving art canvas with actors juxtaposed in every frame. A true visual treat with impeccable story telling. A symphony to the ears, colourful feast to the eyes and enlightenment to all senses. Watch to experience it, savour it and reminisce. Even ten out of ten would be an injustice."
" The Grand Budapest Hotel welcomes audiences to the most whimsical and characteristic lodging cinema has to offer.
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,10,"War-torn Zubrowka. 1932, '68 and '85. A grandiose inn towers over the frosty mountainous peaks, accessible by rickety cable cars. Its halls, like a fabergé egg, wrapped in decorative garnishments. Jewelled classicism haunts the ornate corridors, tainted glows guiding visitors to their designated suites. International guests, brimming with eccentricity, seeking warmth within the inn's own hearth. Employees upholding the luxurious lavishment that surrounds the building's legacy. These descriptions are, of course, illustrating the proud member of the Society of the Crossed Keys that is The Grand Budapest Hotel.Film, in all its expansivity, offers a multitude of poignancy within each story that is told. Some depict historic events in an attempt to remind audiences of humanity's past mistakes, others strive for emotive reflection within their searing drama. Anderson though, no matter where your opinion lies in terms of his trademark aesthetics, is a distinctive storyteller through and through, as if reciting a bedtime tale. Very rarely, the simplest of stories can be the most effective when manipulated by a distinctive style that exudes an abundance of personality. No convoluted twists. No melodramatic sorrow. No burdensome themes. Just good old fashioned capers. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a reminder that film can combine artistic integrity with general entertainment to form a crowd-pleasing feature without resorting to archetypal traits. It is, without a doubt, tapping on the edge of mastery.Through three differently adorned timelines, Anderson's comedy-drama depicts the story of an unlikely friendship between the hotel's concierge and newly recruited lobby boy, as they embark on several misadventures to prove the innocence of a wrongly accused murder.First and foremost, let's address the obvious. Every single frame in this feature can be extrapolated, printed on a canvas and exhibited in an art museum. Anderson, inhibiting his inner Kubrick, meticulously positions his actors, props and camera in such a mesmerising way that it can only be surmised as art. Whether that be precariously placing Fiennes' arm on a counter or dictating hierarchical power by positioning actors far away from each other. It's purposeful to accentuate Anderson's beloved visual flair. His trademark visual style, involving symmetrical compositions, exterior and interior tracking shots, snap-zooms etc., explicitly grants the hotel itself an abundance of character. The introductory segment expends precious limited minutes in detailing the very foundations of the building, most notably the various rooms that occupy its floors, and does so through epigrammatic cinematography that alludes to embellished imagination.Anderson's story flows beautifully throughout, constantly introducing eccentric characters into the eclectic mix of talent. Gustave's flamboyant yet nonchalant persona juxtaposed Zero's monotonously blunt personality, but it is with this stark contrast that the film proudly expresses its ability to marinate polar opposites. Anderson's screenplay bursting with energy, providing supplement to his perceptible approach, granting every single character memorability and characterisations. The odd expletive or two emphasising the hilarity that ensues within Gustave's misadventures, yet bestowing an equilibrium in visual and literary comedy. I recall my initial viewing being an experience of astonishment, by just how much disposition was embedded within the script for such a small runtime.Every cast member embraced Anderson's aesthetic appeal to maximise their characterisation. Fiennes, in particular, was sublime and withheld the ability to switch between passive aggressive to sarcastically calm beautifully. Revolori battling against Fiennes' domineering demeanour perfectly, each assisting each other in becoming that inch closer to perfection. But even members who had minor roles, including Anderson favourites Swinton, Wilson, Schwartzman and Murray, made a massive impression within the hotel. Costumes were exceptional, exhibiting vintage European cultures without hyperbolising its attire.Desplat's score, ranging from a balalaika to traditional orchestral instruments, elevated the surrounding alpine environment that the hotel was built upon. And, finally, praise must be given to the brief animations that were intertwined. From the skiing chase to the mounting of cable cars, the handcrafted nature of these segments, again, aided in producing personality to Anderson's feature. Especially the introductory tracking shot of the Grand Budapest, which was clearly crafted from layered card and agglutinated together.The Grand Budapest Hotel is brimming with intricacies that enable it to be so much more than just a standard comedy-drama. It's a masterful exercise in combining character-driven dialogue with a contemporary visual style, bestowing a mass appeal upon the colossal front doors of the hotel. Quirky, vivacious and aggressively funny, it secures a director's ambition into the realm of auteurism. It is, in my humble opinion, Anderson's greatest cinematic accomplishment and receives an elusive perfect rating from myself. And remember: ""Rudeness is merely the expression of fear""."
" Wes Anderson outdoing himself.
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,9,"I'm not sure how Wes Anderson managed to out-Wes Anderson himself, but this film is proof.
Take all the main elements of all his previous films, boil them down to their purest forms and mix them together and this is what will result. I'm not necessarily saying that this is a bad thing, but the forced symmetry and centering, bright colors, and quick dialogue all are a bit overwhelming at times.
This film is not without its humorous moments, but its true charm comes in the aforementioned visual style. I almost have the feeling that this was the film Wes Anderson wanted to make all along . . ."
" The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,9,"Directed by Wes Anderson. Starring Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, F. Murray Abraham, Saoirse Ronan, Adrien Brody, Jeff Goldbum, Willem Dafoe, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Mathieu Amalric, Harvey Keitel, Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton. (R)A writer recounts his visit to the Grand Budapest Hotel, where the owner (Abraham) describes past events that focus on the friendship between lobby boy Revolori and concierge Fiennes as they get involved in a dangerous inheritance game and the outbreak of war. Presented by writer/director Anderson in his trademark style of artfully-staged whimsy and symmetrical elegance, with greater emphasis on sophistication while being even more meticulously artificial than ever before--many filmmakers borrow, honor or parody his furbelowed trappings, but no one does it quite like him. The cast is over-loaded with talent, including bit parts for several members of Anderson's recurring troupe (Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Bob Balaban, etc.), led by Fiennes in a fabulously droll performance as the dryly-witted and mirthfully-profane M. Gustave. Those who find Anderson's work too twee and precious for their tastes aren't likely to be converted, but it's as cozy as a peapod for anyone else, with eye-popping visual delights and the sort of heartstring tugs he found with ""Moonrise Kingdom"" that had often been absent in his earlier pictures.

" Masterful Wes Anderson film
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,10,"So charming, beautiful, unique, and fun to watch! An incredible pastille of well crafted glorious art throughout! I love how there's videos showing how cool Wes's movies are and the camera shots. Very special experience that isn't talked about enough."
" Best comedy movie of the 21st century
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,10,"Wes Anderson is one of the few directors working today who understands the importance of aesthetics in making a good movie. As someone who can't enjoy a movie if I don't like how it looks, his perfectly designed, retro-flavoured sets are a real boon in this age of harsh lighting, muddled camerawork, and gratuitous cgi. I love his movies even though they're mostly in genres that don't normally interest me. Highly recommended, unless you're one of those people who thinks that Marvel movies are great cinema."

Anderson's almost vignetting work does not want to convey a precise message but delights the viewer with a direction and a script worthy of note. A refined comedy, in full Wes style."
" Visually striking, wonderfully acted, emotionally touching.
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,10,"The Russian army of World War One considered nostalgia an incurable contagious disease. A soldier who was considered to have ""contracted"" this ""disease"" was to be shot as if he was a deserter. If this principle was still the prevailing thought today, I, along with many of the characters of this masterful film, would meet the same fate as a Russian soldier.
M. Gustave H is a man so desperately trying to live his old world in a time that has so dramatically left him and his kind behind. Zero's visas MUST allow him passage, they always have.
Zero gave up a massive fortune to a presumably communist government, who possibly would have let him keep it otherwise, just to keep a reminder of his late beloved.
This movie is not what it seems. On the surface, this is a heist movie, a war movie, a comedy, and a picture of the old world where the rich still toured Europe. But this movie, while being all of that, is far, far more. It is a message that all things end. Zero's absolute desolation by the end of the film, his inability to move on from the ""good times"" before the war is a message to us to do just that. Do not linger on the good times until they are no longer. Move on.
Package all that into a beautifully framed package, and add some hilariously comedic dialogue, and you end up with the best movie of the decade."
" Forgotten gem that I finally got to watch
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,10,"I've heard about thuis movie but never got the chance to watch it, but now with the holidays that came to an end.
I must say that al the good critics were true. The cinematics were beautiful, the acting was brilliant and it was fun to see all those A-list actors performing in big or small rolls.Conclusion: The best movie I've seen in years!"
" Wes Anderson at his best
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,9,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" has the rather peculiar narrative structure of the double flash back. In the beginning of the movie we meet an old writer who remembers an interview he has hold when he was still young (flashback 1). In this interview an old man tells the story of his life (flashback 2).Just like in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" (2012, Wes Anderson) the story seems an adaptation of an exciting boys book, but it is (even more) over the top. Wes Anderson likes his films to be artificial. In his opinion everybody knows that a film is fake and artificiality does not preclude identification.Being over the top the film has also something of a persiflage. The character of Jopling made me think of Anton Chigurgh from ""No country for old men"" (2007, Joel and Ethan Coen). That was a persiflage of a Western but of what genre is ""The Grand Budapest hotel"" a persiflage? At first I thought of Agatha Christie adaptations, the disagreement about the heritage of a person who was murdered being at the core of the plot. At second glance I think ""The Grand Budapest hotel"" is a persiflage of Max Ophuls films, glorifying a society that definitely belongs to history.The world I am alluding to is the Habsburg double monarchy. This world is personified by monsieur Gustave, the hotel concierge who anticipates on the wishes of his (female) clients before they themselves are aware of them. Anderson himself has indicated that ""The Grand Budapest hotel"" was not written but was certainly inspired by Stefan Zweig (""The world of yesterday, 1942). Maybe the writer in the film is Stephan Zweig?.Given this references to the Habsburg empire it was a bit of a surprise to me that the war in the film is not the First- but the Second World War. To give his actors a hint of the ambiance of the film he was aiming at Wes Anderson mentioned ""To be or not to be"" (1942, Ernst Lubitsch), so it really is the Second World War. One of the others film he mentioned was, not surprisingly, ""Grand hotel"" (1932, Edmund Goulding).In the present tense after flashback 1 (the time when the writer is still young en when the narrator is telling his story to him) the Grand Budapest Hotel is definitely in decay. The design is seventies at its worst and makes one think of that other famous film hotel"": the Overlook hotel from ""The Shining"" (1980, Stanley Kubrick)."
" What do you know? Ralph Fiennes made me cry
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,10,"Gustave H. talks about humanity, though he knows he's not the most sterling example of the species. There's a part at the end where we know he was right all along. Yeah, you can say the movie is largely about a bunch of dysfunctional, quirky morons who all have something to do with a pastel pink-painted, sometimes dilapidated hotel, but you can't deny there's something truly authentic about it all."
" UNIQUE.
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,7,"This movie is unique. Funny, different, stylish piece of work that kept me smiling throughout, but there were some parts of the movie that seemed forced in."
" thoughts on the grand budapest hotel
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,10,"Another fantastic Anderson film. Other than the obvious/expected Anderson style that we all know and love, The Grand Budapest Hotel showcases some great writing and execution.The characters were well written and enjoyable to watch. Personally, I found the beginning slightly confusing and at first wasn't really sure who was the narrator until later on in the film. The character/relationship development wasn't forced and felt natural following the plot.This films story line is what I think was the most stand out about it. Sometimes a selective few of Anderson films can seem to slightly blur together in my mind but I think The Grand Budapest Hotel did a good job of being unique and different in terms of the story. (Moonrise Kingdom is another film that does this really well)"
" A fantastic movie of loyalty
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a fantastic movie filled with adventure, action, mystery and love. The movie focuses around two main characters M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and his lobby boy Zero Moustafe (Tony Revolori) and their adventures together and how they solved their problem. While watching the movie you may notice that the key theme through-out the film is loyalty. Wes Anderson (The Director) did an amazing job capturing this theme and presenting it in such a fun and entertaining way with his choice on angles and lighting.
While watching the movie unfold you cannot help but notice the lack of space on screen. Wes Anderson makes sure, in an intentional way, that everything on screen is being used and applied to the whole story of the movie. If you a seeing something happen in the background it is because Wes Anderson wants you to see and notice the event. The angles of The Grand Budapest are rather simple and straight forward but, executed in a brilliant way that does not interfere with the film or distract the viewer with too much. Most of the scenes are filmed head on to Gustave and Zero hiding most of the background or focusing on the main points of the story but, some scenes like the jail break scene intentionally use a different angle to show what is happening. It does not pull from the story it does not ruin the scene and it is fairly subtle and that is the genius of the angles in the movie. As for applying this technique to the theme of loyalty it is done with quite skill. Using the head on filming just the two Gustave and Zero it really helps build their bond for the viewer. We get to see them from the beginning where Gustave does not trust Zero as much it is filmed showing mostly their whole bodies. When we realize the theme of loyalty is when the film is showing the two closer together and more of their upper bodies and faces. That is really when we the viewer become engulfed in the fact that Zero would do anything for Gustave and vise-versa.
The Grand Budapest is filmed with a unique lighting that helps us the viewer know what to feel. At the beginning of film it hotel is dark and almost has a sad fog in it but, when Mr. Mustafe (F. Murray Abraham) is recollecting his journey with M. Gustave the hotel is very well lit and has a joyous feel to it. This lighting technique is used in practically every scene, if we are supposed to feel sad or disappointed then Wes Anderson made sure that the scene was darker and gloomier. This technique can also help enforce the theme in a simplistic but, very well done way: when Gustave and Zero are together the scene is brighter more happy feeling and when they are separated it is darker and gloomier. Eventually, Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) is introduced and she becomes loyal to Zero and when they are together the scene is brighter as well. Ralph Fiennes is no stranger to the lighting technique and a theme of loyalty. However, he is known for the dark lighting playing the bad guy, Lord Voldemort, in what could be his most famous movies; the Harry Potter films. The Harry Potter films share a common lighting style of darkness is sad and light means happiness the films also have a loyalty theme through-out all of them."
" Quirky movie
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,8,Fun movie with quirky humor and great acting. The movie takes the viewer in quite a ride.
" Hey Academy.. Can u hear us?
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,8,I will not rest until the academy pays for their heinous crime of not even nominating ralph fiennes for best performance by an actor in a leading role. just wondering when they'll learn to have fun & recognize comedic talent!!!
" Good, not the best, but it more than meets what is proposed.
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,8,"The Grand Hotel Budapest is a great film and narrative work. It has an excellent script but sometimes sins of pride. A very innovative and fresh narrative; and with an anti-war concept - with a harsh criticism of greed and greed - very well executed in order to be grandiloquent, achieving it clearly. Very good performances, taking the film clearly Ralph. Sublime address. Good soundtrack Good sound. As for its genre, I must emphasize something that seems essential to me: it has been cataloged to the film as a comedy ... but, it does not seem like a comedy, since although it wants to imitate and honor the film branch which Chaplin potentiated , it seems to me that it does not reach that level of comic range; Now, however, this work manages to generate a non-unique, but rare style: a surrealistically detective style, which catches during the hour and a half of the film.
In conclusion: it seems to me an excellent film, which more than achieves what is proposed, without stumbling at any time during its path."
" RUBBISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,1,"Wes Anderson is my Least favourite director of all time. He is only liked by the yuppies and the barriests of the world. All of his movies suck. This was awful! Myb grandma liked it (""quirky"" appartnely) and well, all I could say was OK BOOMER expect that wasn't a thing thenTERRIBLE!
The characterss are really annoying and the plot is inspid."
" A much pleasing watch.
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,10,"I am most impressed by the story telling: it is fast and propelling. I was almost always kept seated, due to the feeling that the climax was about to happen. This and the style of abrupt cutting between scenes reminds of Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Lock, stock and two smoking barrels. There is something comedic and intriguing about them.
The main characters are well built, and the acting did enough to demonstrate it.
The visual is stunning, as I expected before viewing. There is one short sexual shot, and one violent-implying shot, which is great. Keep it natural, no need for PG-13 :D
The anachronistic-ally noble behaviors and etiquette of the main character was a fun to watch. (This certainly reminds me of Kingsman). By showing such usually-ridiculous man under such a positive light, I believe Wes Anderson meant this movie to be a lament of a lifestyle long lost in the course of time.For quite short a screentime, the plot does have to resort to plot conveniences to keep it going. Nevertheless, they are by no means big problems, making no critical pauses to the flow of the movie.A 9.5/10 to me."
" It's a joy - because just when you think it might droop - it picks up a new colour
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,8,"Poinless describing the plot as it's surreal. There's visual joy in this movie from the start. Animation, hyper-reality, backdrop, green-screen, cartoon, It hops about in the most delightful way. All the central cast are great -and all play just the right ""tone"" for their character. There's cameos , most of which are fine, except Goldblum who does his ham schtick as usual and is greasy and creepy , as usual. This whole fim is stand-up unique. There's laughs here and, of course, charm. But it's, truly, all shades, done really well."
" Cinematography
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie is such a pleasure to watch, not only visually but also emotionally. The cinematics and editing of this spectacular movie is astonishing and hightens the audiences emotions to the characters. The cast is superb which is complemented with an amazing script. Would highly recommend this film and enjoy to those who are about to watch!"
" A Masterpiece.
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,10,"Quite simply, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a masterpiece. I'll even take it a step further by saying, that in my personal opinion, as someone whom has rated over 650 feature films on IMDB, it is firmly within the top ten. The reason? It has some of the best world-building in any film.I'm not simply talking about production design (though that was an Oscar well earned), I'm talking about replicating the kind of atmosphere associated with Europe within the works of Stefan Zweig. Anderson has taken something based on truth, and he's added his own wild, quirky and fictional essence to it. What do you get? Something original, yet surprisingly believable.Don't get me wrong, the film has a spectacular story, a great narrative, a great cast, with great performances, great costumes, great music, great cinematography (the use of different aspect ratios for different time periods is very clever, by the way). But overall, the thing which makes me truly love and adore this film is that it creates a world that I'd love to be in more than any other film world.It's escapism."
" Funny, Engaging, Wonderful

" YES

I truly recommend it with great pleasure"
" Something different and gorgeous at that!
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,10,"It's Wes Anderson's movie all the way. Visuals are gorgeous, characters odd and interesting and humor is mostly on the spot. Only thing I didn't really like was the movie's ending. It feels kinda abrupt, though it's not without it's strength. I watched it with a mate and we almost constantly laughed and enjoyed the charm of the movie, especially when things start to heat up. It really has the feeling of a good and memorable movie. I give it 10/10 and I recommend it if you want a fun and beautiful comedy movie crafted with love and care and not some rubbish that usually comes out of Hollywood labeled as comedy, when it's not even close."

" Not a Tripadvisor review
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,10,"Wes Anderson had made a delightful offbeat art house film that never outstays its hospitality. It has a stamp of an assured filmmaker, confident of his eccentric style.Mr Zero Moustafa (F Murray Abraham) recounts to a writer (Jude Law) his tale of the now faded Grand Budapest Hotel over dinner.In 1932, the Grand Budapest Hotel was epitome of decadent and luxury somewhere in Eastern Europe. Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) a refugee started out as a newly hired lobby boy. He is taken under the wing of the eccentric concierge Monsieur Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes.)Gustave in effect runs the hotel and attends to the personal needs to some of the older ladies who stay in the hotel such as Madame D (Tilda Swinton.) When she dies, Gustave is bequeathed a valuable painting. Her son Dmitri (Adrien Brody) is far from pleased with this. Gustave is accused of the old lady's murder and Dmitri's henchman Jopling (Willem Dafoe) makes sure any irritant is disposed off quickly.Wes Anderson has directed a whimsical and absurd black comedy with a camp performance from Fiennes that has a startling odour. It was a shame that he was not Oscar nominated. There are cameos from Anderson regulars such as Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Edward Norton. The story can get dark and murderous at times, it has an underlying sadness. You see proto fascists who demand to see papers of all the travellers on a train. Enough to parallel the real world of the 1930s."
" Exceptional
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,8,This is totally genius work. Shot beautifully and the unexpected plot turns near fails to surprise and the cinematography is of next level.
" A wonderfully funny, creative, stylish, original film with occasional dark tones from the one and only director writer Wes Anderson!
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,10,"Set in a fictional location and hotel of Eastern Europe during World War Two, "" The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a fast moving, hilariously funny, occasionally dark film told in flashback as the aged former owner of The Grand Budapest Hotel tells his story to a young writer. Featuring a great ensemble acting cast. Highly recommended."
" Anderson's greatest.
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,10,"Costumes, makeup, music, performances, direction, cinematography, script, cameos, actor's own accents, Boy With Apple... all sublime.
The only problem I have with this masterpiece is that it wasn't 5 hours longer."
" Light hearted in its depth
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,8,"Light hearted in its depth, fantastic humour. Throughly enjoyed Jude Law in his bystander role."
" Completely Charming
",2019-08-27 00:00:00,10,"Wes Anderson is an unequaled cinematic treasure; or at least, that's how I view him and his work. Anderson is a filmmaker whom plenty of cinephiles adore, but a few find him to be too pretentious. To those who think this film is pretentious, I say 'bah humbug!' It's not pretentious; it's refined. This is a film for people who love stories, more specifically, people who love books and the relationships we can form with their characters even if we don't meet them and about longing for a time that we've never known.Though I enjoy all of Anderson's films, if I'm being honest, I think this is Anderson's best. As far as story goes, it's certainly his tightest and most intriguing script, and it has some of the most delightful and well-developed characters, and the charming world that he crafts in this film is one that I love so much I would be willing to live there (quite seriously). I love this film; I love the characters; and I love the humor. It's simply a marvelous delight to watch."
" A Story Of Legacy, Companionship, Loyalty And Greed.
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,9,"Written and directed by Wes Anderson. ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (set in the fictional war-torn European country Zubrowka in the 1930s) tells the story of two people: Monsieur Gustave H., a concierge, and one of his employees, the lobby boy Zero. Showcasing the friendship they form as they team up for several misadventures while trying to prove Gustave's innocence after he was framed for murder.So I love Wes Anderson. I was introduced to him by watching ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" and falling in love with it. He's definitely got this style to him that is so up my alley it's not even funny. I CANNOT believe I haven't seen this film until recently, it's so damn good. Literally everything about it visually was perfection. The framing of the film, bright color scape, gorgeous sets. There are many moments in this film where I just wanted to pause it and stare at the screen. I'm not sure how much of this film is filmed on an actual built set, if anything was physically built for this I'll be very impressed. But either way I'm impressed honestly.I'm a sucker for good camerawork. This movie has a lot of it, meaning every single shot is intriguing. Whip pans, quick zoom ins, tracking shots, etc. Like ""The Favourite"" it made me drool and I'm not ashamed of that. There's a particular shot that included a character getting into a trolley car and we see a motorbike reflected onto a window with the shade dropped down. Such clever ways of showing us what's happening in the scene without making it grossly apparent. The accompaniment of classic Wes Anderson score adds to every scene as well, heavy strings.The way that the narration is constructed throughout this film is fantastic, it made the movie very engaging while also looking stunning. There's this quick whit to it along with fast paced story-telling. The dialogue is genius. When the movie gets going, it gets going dude! It's essentially a tale of legacy, companionship, loyalty and greed. But we also get this small subplot of a super group of hotel managers and their bellboys. It had me dying! The acting was overall good, but Ralph Fiennes really shines here. His character was so well written! Even though some of the actors didn't have much to do on screen, when they did it was apparent.I also can't talk about this movie without mentioning the superb costume design. I really wanted that purple petticoat so bad! I know the movie got academy awards for costuming and makeup so I'm glad that got recognized. Though the ending felt slightly abrupt, the film is fantastic. Wes Anderson is a master at his craft and I definitely need to watch his other films to fully immerse myself."

" A Little Too Pretty
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,7,"I'm someone who absolutely loves dumb artsy fun in a movie. I love being able to look at a movie and have several times where I audibly say ""Wow."" The problem with The Grand Budapest Hotel is that every frame is one of those frames. The first five minutes are the best. Then, you just become desensitized to it looking good. It honestly kinda hurts to watch. Maybe another person would be fine with it, but I found the movie to be kinda boring and it eliminates what it aimed to be."
" Magnificent
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,10,"Excellent plot, immaculate directing and magnificent sets, this movie has an impressive bag of smarties of my favourite actors/actresses: Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel, Willem Dafoe, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Léa Seydoux and Saoirse Ronan, of course Fiennes is the star of this show from beginning to end. Fantastic in the literal sense are scenes of absolute impossibility managed to perfection in this Art Deco masterpiece. One of the all time greats to watch, you will love it."
" Interesting tale
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,6,"Interesting tale and humour, but not as deep or thought out as I expected it would be. Didn't enjoy the ending, or the beginning. Light hearted comedy."
" A tediously long, drawn-out movie with little entertainment
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,2,"I agree with a few of the other posts in that this is one of the few instances where my rating of the movie differs greatly from the avg IMDB user. I was excited to finally see this movie, and the first 15 minutes gave it a lot of promise. After that, the movie drug on without much excitement, comedy, or character development for the first half only to establish a lazy and played out plot for the second half. All of the great actors that show-up throughout the film have their talents wasted.This film is another great example of critics and film geeks lining up to shower praise on a film that a viewer could take a 45 minute nap and not miss a single thing. If you want a laugh, read the critics reviews on Rotten Tomatoes as they fall over themselves trying to praise the film."
" Pretentious? Nope. Fun? O yes.
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,9,"I was put off watching this film by the polarised reviews on IMDB, then watched it and realised exactly why some of those reviews were so polarised - because some were looking for more in the film than a tall-tale beautifully and wonderfully told. To me it succeeds in telling that tale remarkably well. Some say it's pretentious, over-long and makes poor use of a ""stellar"" cast - I'd say it's none of those things myself, indeed the ""stars"" taking part might even be glad (and proud) they got to play even a small role in this truly remarkable, fantastic and silly-fun film. Stars don't always make a film remember."
" Entertaining
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,7,"A story is told in flashback about the titular hotel in the fictional small country of Zubrowka in alpine Europe. In 1932, the hotel's concierge (Ralph Fiennes) is wrongly accused of murder of one of the hotel's wealthy guests.Directed and co-written by Wes Anderson, this film shares the same unique whimsy which Anderson showed most recently in ""Moonrise Kingdom"". The energy is always snappy especially with camera angles that move forward, backward, up, down, and sideways to display events happening simultaneously.The story and characterization are enjoyable though not especially strong. But with an energetic performance from Fiennes plus Anderson's playful direction, this film comes off as quite charming and entertaining."
" Wes Anderson does it again
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is an experience like no other. Never have I seen a movie so original, creative and beautifully made.Wes Anderson is a director who clearly understands his craft and knows what he's doing. The camerawork is simply sublime. Every shot feels artistic in some way and works well with the time period the film's set in. The set design is gorgeous. The wide range of bright colours creates this joyous and retro feeling. I love the change of aspect ratio as the time of year changes. Each one is respectable and used to its advantage during each time period.The acting overall is just outstanding to say the least. Ralph Fiennes gives his best performance in years as M. Gustave. He adds so much charm and wit which adds a lot of likability to his character. As a debutant, Tony Revolori was brilliant and is a great accomplice to M. Gustave. Two other characters which I thought were amazing were Jopling (Willem Dafoe) and Deputy Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum). Both actors portrayed them perfectly and brought some of the most precious moments in the film overall.Wes Anderson's script was something you've never heard before. He adds so much interesting and investing dialogues which embellishes the characters completely. Anderson doesn't stop his imagination from running wild. His story has a mixed bag of darkness, excitement and humour to keep the viewer from getting bored at any point. Accompanied with his stylish direction, the costumes, cinematography, score, set design, acting and crisp editing this fairy-tale like film is a one of a kind experience that has to be watched at any given cost."
" An exception film to watch when you are bored
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,9,"Such an amazing film I watched after a long time. Little comedy is so perfect and right on the plot. First half is story telling and second half is crime plus thrill. Difficult to decide who's the hero in the movie both the Lobby Boy and Gustave have a very strong character. I watched it with my wife and we literally paused, rewinded and discussed the scenes multiple times."
" Favorite movie
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,10,This has perfect cinematography and is extremely funny at times and is a tear jerker at others.
" You're the first of the official death squads to whom we've been formally introduced.
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,10,"Damn I love this film.Of all Wes Andersons films this is the one that impresses me the most, a wimsy of live actions with a dash of animation dotted here and there connecting the many scenes & locations.Though some friends I knew did not like it, as I said ""Wimsy"" you have to like that and I found I did.This is a sad but funny tale of the early days of a Lobby boy within the Grand Budapest Hotel, it is a story of romance, murder, art theft, jailbreak and a cast of gloriously barking mad maniacs and oh yes, theres chocolates as well.Maniacs I said, oh yes, don't blink or you'll miss yet another great actor or actress playing a bit part just because its FUN! And above all else is Ralph Fiennes best part in years.Thats the thing funny & sad but above all else this film is fun.So come visit the Grand Budapest, just dont forget to tip the lobby boy;)"
" Unique and fun to watch
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,9,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a unique movie. Its artistically shot, almost looks like a Cadbury's advert, the cast is breathtaking despite the short appearances of some and the script, simply genius. Its by far one of the funniest movies Ive watched this year, which is helped by quite brilliant relationship between Zero and Gustave. At times it feels like its been edited to look like a silent movie and the grandness and colour is used effectively to be so pleasing on the eye creating a sense of wonder about this odd story. It is a strange movie but will be enjoyed by all."
" A breathtaking tapestry of beautiful images and brilliant characters!
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,9,"As one can guess by the title of this review, The Grand Budapest Hotel is one heck of a film. No, this isn't just a movie but also a fine specimen of the artistic brilliance of Wes Anderson and the team.
Admittedly, I'm rather late to the party and shamefully enough, I have not been witness to much of Anderson's work. But, that doesn't stop me from appreciating the fact that TGBH has aged like fine wine.
The frames are so immaculately shot yet so simple when you think about it. There's a sort of mechanical precision in the way Anderson and his DP capture the story. The grandeur of the setting is expressed beautifully and use of colour and the colour theory is so damn well-done!
The characters are so....unique. And interesting. And engaging. It's as if I'm reading literature, there's some sort of 'literary texture' in the way they speak, interact and move. So engrossing!
The plot itself is not really complex and is rather straightforward and even comical at times. It's really absurd and that's Anderson's whole shtick, isn't it?As you can see, I cannot stop gushing over this film! It's safe to say that it's certainly one of the better ones I've seen in a WHILE.Solid 9/10."
" Brilliantly acting and masterful comedy and a fell good film

" An Anderson work of art.
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,9,"The story of a hotel manager and his lobby boy told through the mystery of a terrible murder, with an excellent touch of comedy, absurdity and above all, Anderson.Those who are related to Wes Anderson's work know that they are for a special movie, and let me tell you that it is completely. No film can be compared to such an exceptionally original work. Wes' direction is something that already stands out without needing to mention it, he knows how to direct like no one else, his style is simply impeccable and he has been given a special place in the history of cinema.This film is no exception to his style, but it is one of his best examples. Manufactured in a detailed and unique way, with an excellent atmosphere unique to find, a wonderful style reminiscent of a play. The performances are magnificent, incredible and fun; it is a comedy with a slight criminal and mysterious touch, full of fun and unique moments that undoubtedly make this film deserves a special place. The relationship between the protagonists is something fantastic and wonderful to observe through the development of the plot, never boring and always keep us emotionally attached to them, something I must highlight is that, the film will move us completely with a unique narrative and a special ending.A fantastic film, a comic tragedy with a style impossible to plagiarize."
" Nothing more than a murder mystery with obsessively detailed visuals
",2019-05-17 00:00:00,1,"This is the first Wes Anderson movie I've ever watched, and given it's supposed to be its masterpiece, I think it will be the last one. In fact, I could just stand to watch half of it, and decided it wasn't worth wasting the rest of my time so just read the rest of the argument.When I watch a movie, I wanted to have some emotion behind it, and to teach me something. The reason why didn't like this movie (and probably, Wes Anderson's particular style) is that I felt there was nothing in it besides its visuals, this perfectionist shots and stiff way of acting. All the scenes look alike, and all actors act in the same way: stiff, inexpressive. It didn't seem funny to me at any point.Even if the plot made up for it (which is based on a book by Zweig), the execution of the film just spoils it. This very plastic, very materialistic outlook of the movie, with an obsession with this beautiful visuals, just seems a way for the author to conceal the shallowness of the movie."
" Unique

" A time capsule you'll both regret and not regret
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is like fantasy, adventure, visual art, and a bowl of chicken noodle soup all distilled into one rollercoaster of an experience that leaves you with the feeling of waking up from a dream you wish you could return to. Wes Anderson is known for his cinematography and quirky stories, and whether you've been a Wes Anderson fan for years, or you're new to his work, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a solid pick.
The plot of the film revolves around Gustav H. (Ralph Fiennes), the head concierge at a very high-class hotel in the 1930's. The story is told from the perspective of Zero (Tony Revolori), a young refugee that is hired by Gustav as a lobby boy. After an elderly guest of the hotel meets her untimely demise, she wills a priceless painting to Gustav. Then begins a whirlwind of drama between the children of the women led by her son Dmitri (Adrien Brody), Gustav, and Zero as they try to track down a secret will and try to avoid being murdered by Dmitri's hired thug.
The story is exceptional, and a blast to watch unfurl for every second of the 110-minute runtime, but what makes The Grand Budapest Hotel truly unique amongst a sea of delightful and satisfying films is its cinematography. Many of the wide-angle shots in the movie, believe it or not, were created using sets built with miniature models, and then stylized further in post-editing. This type of set design and cinematography gives The Grand Budapest Hotel a truly exclusive feeling of warmth and surrealism.
When you put all the elements of the film together, though, it left me with a profound feeling of loss. It was a strange feeling to have after watching what had chiseled its way into my top three favorite movies of all time. A feeling like I may never again enjoy a movie like the one's which credits I was seeing scroll by. Then it hit me, while the shots were beautiful, the comedy sharp, and the PG-13 action was top notch, the whole story was really a story of loss.
The loss of a different time, further described by the opening shot in which a girl brings a book to a statue, in an obviously muted world. Then that statue is revealed to be an author, who wrote the story of Zero. These separate layers of storytelling ingrain the feeling that while you, the viewer, are experiencing the grandeur of Gustav H., its beauty, class, and wonder is firmly in the past, never to be experienced firsthand again. I felt the loss most painfully when the author was speaking to Zero in the time-scorched Grand Budapest that I'd learned to love, and listening to him regale losing Agatha, and losing Gustav. It was then, that I felt the true loss that The Grand Budapest is portraying.
A quote from Gustav, ""You see, there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity."". Through the movie we come to know that Gustav represents this faint glimmer, and then we are forced to realized that faint glimmer that makes up every one of the many warm feelings stirred when watching the film, went out along with him. That made me feel a loss that I will carry with me for some time."
" Art, not entertainment
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,7,"While the film had a certain aesthetic and dialogue that would, in my opinion, define and qualify it as art, it just lacked any real entertainment - watching it would be like admiring art in a museum, not watching a film.
Its culmination was disappointing and the film didn't get my attention at any point of the film. It seemed to lack depth.
Still, it made for good art and was overall a very unique and somewhat intriguing concept."
" An Odd Little Film.

Every scene is framed like an exquisite work of art.While I'm not fond of the story or it's characters - the color and cinematography is gorgeous to keep looking at!And just like a good looking cake its full of sugar and empty calories - a marvelously pretentious movie with no apologies! Happy viewing!
" The rating this has is as pretentious as the film
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,1,"This is a tediously irritating, messy, pretentious and boring film which utilizes extremely uninteresting characters that rely on the 'weird' Wes Anderson humor/pacing (which I don't mind if what they where saying or doing was actually funny or had substance) in order to appear relevant as a character, in a VERY uninteresting story that keeps jumping from one line to another every 4 minutes.
The lobby boy was particularly awful. There was absolutely nothing special or endearing about him wich would make me believe that the main character would get attached to him. Which actually seemed to had happened from one second to another and for no particular reason.
Also, something that contributed to make me take the story less seriously was the casting of Murray Abraham as the adult version of a latin boy. It's like casting Beyonce to play the adult version of Elle Fanning. Just plain bizarre."
" This's a well-finished work in perspective!
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,8,"In spite of an innocuous and an elusive story, I'm surprised it wasn't that boring. The attention to the details that went into making it was really good! The colors, the music, the buildings, the costumes and the videography. All of those are really done well.
Also, the characters and their worldviews are very unique.
Its attraction is a rather beauty of shots and characters' personality than the actual story."
" Great
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,10,I'm surprised by how much I liked this.Totally unexpected.
" The Grand Budapest Hotel
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,10,"The Grand Budapest hotel was written and Directed by Wes Anderson. The Film was released in 2014, and was based in part on a series of short stories written by Stefan Zweig. The film stars Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori as a pair of hotel workers at the Grand Budapest Hotel. The film won 4 Oscars and was nominated for another five. This is Anderson's seventh feature length film, as well as his most successful.The film revolves around the characters of M. Gustave, as played by Ralph Fiennes, and Zero, Tony Revolori, Gustave is a concierge at the Grand Budapest, and Zero is his lobby Boy. After Gustave is framed for murder, the two are forced to unravel the mystery behind the death and clear Gustave's name.The sheer beauty of this film is breath-taking. Never before in a film have I seen such vibrant and detailed scenes and backgrounds. Each frame looks like it could be its own painting. The cinematography is excellent, and the film has its own distinctive and independent style I have not seen in any other film. The plot of the film, as well as its pacing, is also wonderful. It's a fascinating plot about mystery and humour.The acting in this film, while of times fast paced, rings true and is full of genuine emotion. The relationships between the characters is extraordinary and fascinating. Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori's relationship is one of the greatest highlights of the film. A nice little detail to note is that despite the film set in a fictional Germanic country, all of the actors retain their own native accents. This particularly evident with the characters played by Saorise Ronan and Jeff Goldbloom, who Irish and American accents respectively, are extremely distinct from anyone else in the film. This is interesting as the Director, Wes Anderson, hired these people based solely on their acting ability, their nationality and their ability to speak with an accent was not considered.I find it difficult to think of any negatives about this film. The only one I can think of is that some people had issues with the ending, but I think it ended perfectly. Such as it was.The Grand Budapest, to me at least, is a masterpiece. Filled with wonderful performances, a great plot and absolutely amazing cinematography, it is one of my favourite films I have ever seen.Without a doubt the Grand Budapest Hotel is a perfect Ten out of Ten for me."
" Just another super impressive work of cinema
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,10,"The movie shows a great use of cinematography and lighting and color. The most impressive part is the color in this movie. Every single shot is attractive to look at and it will keep you invested in the story if subtle funny dialogues are not your thing, The story is nothing exceptional, but it didn't needed to be anything other than what the story was. The sarcastic use of visual and written cliche was very appreciated a lot by me. The other thing I loved about the movie was how it was almost like a play I was watching live. Definitely watch this movie for what it is."
" great movie
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,8,"A lovely movie which i can watch again and again.with this and fantastic mr fox and life aquatic, wes anderson really hits the sweet spot"
" FUN AND INTELIGENT
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,7,"This great scenes make you full of joy ,colorful and intelligent , this is what i can say about this fantasy movie , of course i don't like the murderer individual."
" Slick, stylish and ferociously funny
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,9,"Wes Anderson is perhaps one of the most delightfully unusual filmmakers working today, his films characterised by picturesque symmetry, wry humour and more than a hint of the macabre. The Grand Budapest Hotel is no different and actually stands as one of Anderson's finest films; it's precisely choreographed, gorgeous to look at and, above all, an intelligent comedy that pays homage to bygone cinema whilst adding its own unique spin.
Though the action may jump time periods (whether it's from Tom Wilkinson's direct narrator or F. Murray Abraham's narrator within the story), it centres around The Grand Budapest Hotel, an elite establishment for the rich and pampered in the fictional state of Zubrowka. Our attention is immediately turned to M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), the hotel's concierge, who tends to the guests with a managed slickness... that is when he isn't courting dowagers into his room. The film takes off on a race of storytelling, as Gustave is framed for the murder of an old lover (a prosthetic-clad Tilda Swinton) and must flee the law and who knows else with only the help of his protégé, lobby boy, Zero (a suitably boyish Tony Revelori, when not played 30 years down the line by a mellow F. Murray Abraham).
The film is a delightful farce, Anderson and Hugo Guiness' script providing intelligent and subtle comedy that delivers even amid such a frenetic and occasionally scatty pace. For the most part though, The Grand Budapest Hotel is as tightly wound as one could expect from Wes Anderson; even amid the absurdity of ski chases and severed fingers, there's a remarkable level of control to the madness, helped along by Anderson's assured writing and direction.
Employed in the cast is a who's who of star-studded spectacle; Ralph Fiennes, Willem Dafoe and Saoirse Ronan are plot-central, but around them are bit cameos from the likes of Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and Lea Seydoux. Fiennes leads with rapier-sharp timing as Gustave, his performance radiating clipped composure, all complete with an irresistible charm. The supporting cast are admittedly largely one-note (occasionally the abundance of celebrity proves a little distracting) but are earnest enough to drive the film through.
Where the film has perhaps received the highest praise, however, is its design. The Grand Budapest hotel is a visual treat, its design vibrant yet avowedly architected. There's almost a sense of the characters having been painted on screen; from the bright colours, sharp angles and miniature set pieces, the film feels as much a spectacle of art as an espionage romp. Alexandre Desplat's score is perfectly judged, the musical voice established by the distinct and innovative use of the balalaika. The film is shot with equal verve, snapping from camera ratios incessantly to produce an energised and unexpected cinematography that boosts the narrative. At points, the movie may be a case of style over substance, but the film's unusual design only seems to enhance one's enjoyment of it.
The Grand Budapest Hotel is a strange film, a comedy full of black humour and gentlemanly profanity. Thoroughly entertaining and visually enchanting, this is certainly a gem from Wes Anderson."
" The Great Grand Show misses its greatness slightly
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Well, 4 Oscars. You are kidding me, huh! But yes, it has got. Ask them about Psycho? It got 4 nominations. Oscars can be a bit baffling at times. Anyways, not a bad movie. Indeed a good one. But can never be a great without that Oscar tag. Sadly, there was no chance of Ralph Fiennes grabbing an Oscar as his role was not of an protagonist or a supporting cast. It was good all the way. But, never ever a great movie as has been portrayed. An honest opinion.So not wasting much of a webpage."
" Very artful and absurd, partly surreal, Comedy. Visually stunning !
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,8,"Every inch in this movie looks visually perfected, every word in the script has a purpose.
Wes Anderson, inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig, lets his fantasy blossom in 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. He, with the help of everyone involved (costume/setting designers, the huge ensemble of legendary actors, sound department, etc.), manages very well to let the viewers be part of this colorful world.
Yet it felt like a very long 99 minutes and I expected more of the plot. Still a very loveable and appreciated piece of art."
" perfect in every way
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is my favorite film of all time. I do not have a single problem with the film. It has incredible acting, an incredibly engaging story, and wonderful visuals. I don't know about you because this is just a personal preference of mine, but I absolutely love Wes Anderson's style, and TGBH is his style at its most prominent. This film just has such a unique visual flare to it. The Grand Budapest Hotel is perfect in every way. For a movie that's really just about how someone gains possession of a hotel, I could never, in a million years, think of a move creative idea."
" Expecting more
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,6,I was expecting a little more from this film with a star studded cast. Overall a little disappointing
" What if Hergé met Wes Anderson?
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,6,"The movie consists of consecutive tableaus. One cinematic comic book style dollhouse backdrop after the other. Never closing in on a reality anyone has ever seen. Dream like at times, the contradiction to this the overt nature of man that is evident as it is decadent greed and perversion.
I kept thinking this is what would happen if Tintin was made into the realm of the real tangible world."
" The Grand Budapest Hotel
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,10,"A masterpiece of a film that is striking in every sense. Memorable characters, a delightful plot and most impressively, it is absolutely gorgeous of a film. Grand Budapest Hotel contains everything a movie lover can ask for. It's visual and pace is distinctively Wes Anderson while paying homage to films from the past. It has a sense of mystery found in movies from 60s and 70s, complete with delightful foreign names and a quirky mystery. Despite all this, there is also something so pure and true behind the film, it tells the story and journey of men. While not always glamorous, these special men remains loyal to themselves and their beliefs, and this is what coats the entire movie into the masterpiece that it is. A special movie that can be seen as the masterpiece of one of the most imaginative director of our time, Grand Budapest will also live in my memory for a long time."
" More like an experience than a movie
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,10,"I can see why this movie might be divisive among people, the storyline is complicated and the dialouge can seem stilted at times, but I cannot deny the profound effect it had on meThere are very few movies that I have finished and wanted to watch again immediately after but this is one of them. Every shot is like a piece of art, and there is just this sense that the world being displayed is not our own but like some surreal Wes Anderson-land.Although it is unlike the real world it still manages to portray this true feeling of melancholy that I have simply not experienced with any other movie.While I do not think it is a flawless movie I do think it something everyone should see once."
" Deserved in my oppinion
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely amazing! Great casting, great story, great acting, amazing dialogues, excellent music, loved all about this movie."
" Best film I've seen in years
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,10,Rivals Inglorious Bastards in its originality & humor.
" Hence a witty one, a certain sadness and longing there is.
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,10,"Definitely Wes Anderson's masterpiece for me, reckoning the screenwriting, cinematography technique, and all. I myself have the favouritism of Chaplin, Iñárritu, Kubrick, Tarkovsky and Bertolucci. But after I've finished Grand Budapest Hotel, I immediately know what the missing piece of my life is!And what an amusing film! There is a tremendous flairs, a unique one, of what I call ""life"" there; a spectrum of time that you could feel the absolutely of pleasure out of it, a conundrum and a tear shed for humanity, and a momentary of a certain sadness. From time to time, I usually have a different word to describe those feeling of life passing by, the romanticism... and a vast, indescribable longing of something far, far away...After the end roll in which I was clapping my hands along, it's good too know that The Grand Budapest Hotel gave me those beautiful feeling... and at least I'm contented by that fact."
" Just perfect
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,10,"A beautiful, well crafted film with great attention to detail and excellent pace. The accompanying score works an absolute treat setting both time and place. What a wonderful film, Well done."
" What a pile of crap
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,1,My husband liked this and I thought it was one of the most stupid films ever which was just quite frankly weird and very very long!
" As a non Wes Anderson fan, I did find this pleasant and the cast does an amazing job
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,7,"I'm not a bit Wes Anderson fan but this was enjoyable, with great performances from all."
" An amazing pop-up book
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,9,"Where many films attempt to be endearing in a way that ends up being artificial, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is artificial in a way that is endearing. Wes Anderson doesn't try to pretend it's real and that allows him to make GBH as delightfully eccentric as can be. The aspect ratio is perfectly harnessed to make every shot one-of-a-kind. He has a way of framing every moment in the most perfect way, and this is often used for delightfully goofy humour. Playing into the artificiality, some of the shots appear to use models, such as shots of the hotel from far off and the brilliant ski chase.The characters are charming and funny but not one-note. Gustave and Zero are a great pair of protagonists. The way their friendship pans out fleshes both of them out. Gustave is not a simple character, his quirkiness hiding real depth. He is loyal and values loyalty, but this tends to be the case when he hopes to get something in return. His kindness to fellow prisoners for example is rewarded by allowing him to escape without calling the guards. Or does he genuinely want to please people without expecting anything in return? The way he takes Zero on despite him having zero qualifications surely shows that to be true. Zero himself is definitely not of zero worth, showing himself to be multifaceted. He puts loyalty to Gustave above everything else but he isn't defined by it, nor is he afraid to stand up to him openly. Over the course of the film it's impossible not to care about him and to feel sorry when tragedy strikes."
" ""It is never until one realizes that one means something to others that one feels there is any point or purpose in one's own existence"": Stefan Zweig.
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,8,"Inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig. Novelist and short story writer. Born at Vienna 1881. Died of suicide at Petropolis, Brazil 1942.This is a work by director/ writer/ producer Wes Anderson. Playful, funny, original and quite unigue! A cartoonesque styled picture about love in times of war. Cant compare it with anything else because Wes Anderson's directing style is so quirky and unique.Anyone familiar with this director will wanna watch everything he makes, because he belongs to the pinnacle of indepedent american film making. He wrote AND produced AND directed this movie. His total creative control over all his movies makes them unique in its kind. Yes it is a comedy, but not as we are used to see it. Yes, it is quirky, but not as we were used to see it before.Wes Anderson's comedies are subtle,full of tongue in cheek jokes and photographed in a CARTOONESQUE visual style that has been copied (miserably) by many others. Wes Anderson's direction style is not just a simple technique though, but a set of mind which differentiates Wes Anderson's pictures from all the other comedies. His jokes are very visual. Many many many directors CAN NOT achieve such a level of visual comedy, it is a unique talent only a few directors are blessed with. Wes Anderson is one of them.Now you still dont know if this movie might be to your liking. Let me explain it this way: IF you love arthouse movies and IF you love to be touched by gorgeous creative photograhpy and original quirky stories then this movie is definitely worth trying. IF none of the before apply to you, this movie might be a waste of your time, because it is too peculiar to be liked by the masses, although it was the most popular independent movie of that year. Please take a chance, if you dont like this particular visual style, you will find out within 15 minutes. The rest will have discovered a delightful gem, suited for young and old."
" Destined To Be a Classic
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,10,"Stunning, Beautiful, Witty and Warm, these would be only a few words of which describe the grandeur of ;The Grand Budapest Hotel' a story told retrospectively by a writer whom found himself being a told a retrospective story himself.From the bold acting of M. Gustave and the star studded cast with each vibrant roles, makes this film beautiful. I found myself watching it several times as Wes Anderson's use of camera techniques and story telling are tremendous. The use of Cinema is often wasted in the hands of directors where a big budget will leave you feeling unsatisfied or tithe you over for two hours. However, This work of art gives cinema a new meaning, a classic meaning. More art lesser the mindless action. Each scene belongs and feels like time and creativity was put into it.Too many times have I watched a film and been left cheated from my money. Not these title though. It was a story that I loved and still do.Would I recommend this title?Yes, In a heart beat."
" Majestic as always
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,9,"It's a fantastic Wes Anderson film.
Definitely stands up after repeate watches.
Fiennes is spectacular, so is everyone else for that matter.
The cast includes one of my top 5 most hated actresses/actors and wes made them look good.
Not much else to say except watch it."
" A grand movie.
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,8,"Not being a big fan of Oscar winning movies normally, the year 2015 was a great year for the Oscars. Great movies like The Theory of Everything, Still Alice, The Imitation Game and Interstellar, were all worthy competitors like The Grand Budapest Hotel was. It was a difficult year to chose the best from all those movies. The Grand Budapest Hotel won 4 Oscars and it deserved them all. No Oscars for actors though, and that's because of the quality of the other movies, as Ralph Fiennes did a great job in this movie playing M. Gustave. The young Tony Revolori as Zero, the lobby boy, was also a delight to watch. The rest of the cast, with great names as Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray etc, they all have minor roles but it says enough about the quality of the cast and the movie. Probably Wes Anderson's best as thus far. The movie is very pleasant to watch as it is told in a funny but very structured way. It looks like everybody is walking in a straight stiff line, what gives this movie that something special. The cinematography is also a delight to watch, it's all very horizontal and vertical, every shot is rehearsed until it looks all strangely normal. Not only is it well shot but the story is also captivating enough to keep you amused and entertained. Definitely one of the better movies of that year."
" Perfect film to study filmmaking
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,10,"This is by far one of the best films i have seen to understand cinema as . a language. This also helped me understand a lot of things about framing, composition, lighting and a lot more.
Wes Anderson is . no doubt one of the best director in the entire world."
" World of Wes Anderson
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,8,Another feeling. Another thoughts. Development of imagination. Development of imagination.
" Engaging Fantasy
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,7,"A fantasy, comedic story of the owner of a grand hotel. Luridly coloured, and inventively shot, the story is daft but engaging, with many humorous moments (but few to me were laugh out loud) and the characters and events quirky, but not to the extent of disbelief."
" Beautifully Absurd
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,8,"""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" has a wonderful quirkiness to it that can only be felt, not explained. It is incredibly charming, as can be expected from a Wes Anderson film.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: Once again, Wes Anderson directs with amazing artistry. The story is one that is both hilarious and melancholy. It is a film that refuses to be forgotten. *Editing/Cinematography: The cutting together of the film is near perfect. Every moment timed beautifully and expertly. All the ridiculousness unfolds without blemish. Director of Photography Robert Yeoman brings back the signature style of Wes Anderson films that audiences have grown to love. The color palette is vibrant and exciting. The camera moves are quirky and odd. It all falls together wonderfully. *Dialogue/Acting: Total ridiculousness is what comes out of the mouths of the characters, but that is all for the better. We feel pulled into the world of the Grand Budapest Hotel for how absurd it is and how unlike our world it is. The performances are incredible by all of the cast. Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, and F. Murray Abraham all shine in this wonderful film. But everyone clambers for their chance in the spotlight. Jude Law, Saoirse Ronan, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Tony Revolori, and others all perform spectacularly. *Music/Sound: Once again, the music is phenomenal like in most Wes Anderson films. It has an air of innocence but also a bit of chaos and even some melancholic themes. It is the perfect accent to a beautiful film. The sound design is detailed and incredible. *Production Design/Special Effects: The costumes and set pieces are glorious and visually incredible. They are fantastic additions to the world Wes Anderson has created. The props and miniatures are all wonderfully made. The animation portions are gorgeous. All parts of the film tie together wonderfully.*Conclusion: ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" is a wonderfully bizarre film that must be watched. But although it is sure to be enjoyed, one may not be able see if there was a reason for all of it. And perhaps it doesn't need one. That is what adds to the charm."
" One of the most underrated films by IMDB standards.
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,10,"I have, honest to god, seen this move a number of times succeeding that of my fingers. And every single time, it never ceases to amaze me.This movie is evidently, a beautiful one. Every scene, every prop, every colour, and every shot is so deliberate. Yet, the movie, in its entirety, extend far beyond a series of colourful and lavish shots. The dialogue is impeccable. Each character is given their own personality; a quirky set of dispositions that remain, throughout the movie, largely believable, and more importantly, strongly enforced. From Zero, to C. Gustave, to Agatha and Jopling, you are left, not only wishing them to be real, but very likely believing it yourself.On the surface, you may gather that this movie conveys a grand adventure, through the plains of all worlds, in recovery of a painting. It is very much a grand adventure, but this term should be applied to the relationship formed between Gustave and Zero. I find, that if you consider this notion when watching the movie, all the deliberation of camerawork, care in colour, and attention to detail will leave you truly amazed."
" Why Our time is so useless
",2018-11-08 00:00:00,1,"I think it is my first review, I think so.Well what I want to say is that I very much want to sue the maker of this movie and also the voters who have given more than minimum possible rating.Come on guys, are we kids? Who can give me back my precious time wasted on this ...... I don't know what to say it."
" Extraordinary! Much better than Birdman
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel was robbed of numerous Oscars when it was in my opinion a significantly better film than Birdman. Everything in TGBH is flawless! The cinematography is gorgeous. The script is deeply engaging. The directing evidences such a high level of detail. The makeup and costumes are admiring to glance at. Wes Anderson creates such a beautiful and fanciful story woven between two horrific periods of endless conflict. It is remarkable both as mere entertainment, and for artfully weaving comedy and the futility of war implication in such a satisfying manner. It is enjoyable to watch over and over again. Anderson has created arguably his best film to date!"
" I'm in love with this. Thank you Anderson.
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,9,"I've ben a big fan of Fantastic Mr Fox since the year it came out, at which point I was only 6 years old. I saw in it a fast, quirky and symbolic tale whose pacing and speed of comedy is what made it so great to me. Besides, I loved the animation style and the way it completely subverted how other films are crafted. This was the first point in which I understood Wes Anderson.Last year, the trailer for Isle of Dogs dropped, and my excitement sprang up. Even the trailer showed that it still had the same quirky style. When I watched the movie, I will admit that I didn't think it was quite as good, as some of the comedy was swapped for some rather dark stuff, but heck, it was still a very fun movie.Cut to a couple of days ago, where I discover that this had been put on Netflix. I'd never really heard about it before, recognising the title but knowing nothing of what it was about. So I immediately dove in blind.I will admit that it does drag a bit at first, because everything happens so fast that the first half hour contains a whole hour of material. It fixes the pacing a little later on however, and I could finally settle down. First things first: this movie is fantastically unique. Despite the fact that it is live action, it still manages to add in the half drama, half comedy antics that were present in the animated flicks, with the addition of some brilliantly crafted music which feels suited to the era it is set in and somewhat Pink Panther-esque. This allows even the darkest bits of the movie to be funny, and some of the things that the characters do and say is in the area of comedy gold.I did not expect so many things to happen in the space of 100 minutes, but it is so jam packed full of fast walking, dialogue gags and side shots that despite the bad pacing, I couldn't stop enjoying myself. Not to mention I flat out had to pause it laughing when one character got his fingers chopped off by a metal door. This is why this film is such a great description of the masterful way Wes Anderson can blend together two totally opposite genres and fuse them in a way nobody else can. This is undoubtably one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Definitely worth a watch."
" Charmily Funny Adventure
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,8,"This movie has a little bit of everything. It has comedy, suspense, romance, drama and visual appeal. It is the retelling of a story once heard from the mouth of Zero Mustafa, former lobby boy of the Grand Budapest Hotel. He tells of a roller coaster adventure he has with Mr. Gustove, his boss, mentor and friend, revolving around the death of a wealthy, elderly lady and a painting that she leaves to Mr. Gustove. As they become more caught up in the circumstances of greed, murder and concealment, they realize they must figure things out for themselves.I loved the way this film was shot. The colors were engaging for the eye and the shots were grand. The acting was top notch with cameo appearances in a script that was well written. The story was cleaver and while there were a few moments, for me, that seemed to drag slightly, it was a well paced film overall. It is something that I would recommend to a friend."
" Excellent
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,10,"A brilliantly written and acted film. Funny, witty, and beautiful rich viewing. Absolutely star studded and worth every single cameo within."
" The dialogue is quick and the humor is brisk
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,8,"The Grand Budapest Hotel definitely has that quirky charm that we've all come to expect from Wes Anderson movies. The dialogue is quick and the humor is brisk during this flashback within a flashback within a flashback. Plus, it's impossible to dislike Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of unflinching propriety in the face of disagreeable circumstances. This is probably in my top three Wes Anderson movies."
" I've just got to stop watching Wes Anderson movies
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,4,"My fondness for Royal Tennenbaums combined with the critical acclaim and distinct look of Wes Anderson's movies always sucks me in, but I've regretted every Anderson film I've watched from Darjeeling Limited on, and Budapest Hotel is no exception.I can't say a lot about the plot because I saw the movie on a red-eye and slept through the middle. From what I saw it's about a man who inherits a painting and has some trouble about it.The man is played by Ralph Fiennes and he is terrific as a cool, quick-witted, unflappable character. His dialogue is sharp and funny. The movie overall is pleasantly goofy.,So why didn't I like it? Well ...Some movies engage and draw in the viewer. Some movies try to do that a fail. But Budapest Hotel strives to distance the viewer as much as possible. Characters are filmed at a distance and speak in rapid-fire patter that never achieves the warm quirky charm you get from patter-classics like The Front Page or Bringing Up Baby. The movie feels like a clever experimental short built around the concept of people in a dollhouse and stretches it out forever. Everything in this screams out FORMAL EXPERIEMENT; nothing screams out CARE ABOUT THIS.Would I have enjoyed this movie more if I'd not been so sleepy? Maybe a little. I might have found this a more almost-fun movie like Fantastic Mr. Fox rather than an increasingly annoying one like Moonrise Kingdom. But ultimately I find all of Anderson's later films are quirk-heavy stylistic exercises that leave me cold, and there was nothing in what I saw of Hotel to make me believe my reaction wide awake would have differed much from my reaction half asleep.So this is it. No matter how the critics rave, Budapest will be my last Anderson movie. For those of you who like this sort of thing, ENJOY!"
" cinematic delight
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,9,"In my opinion this is Wes Anderson's finest work as a whole. From the use of colors and symmetry every shot is pleasant to the eye and entertaining to watch. The dialog is witty charming and engaging. Fiennes does exceptional as his role as the concierge with an all star supporting cast including Murray, Willis, and Norton adding even more to an already great movie. Overall a 9/10 and in my personal top 10."
" Loved it!
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,9,"Absolutely fell in love with this movie. 
You can't aliken this film to any other which is so refreshing. 
The casting was genius, the film was fun, thrilling, a little chilling at times but a real heart warmer. Ralph Fiennes was the perfect choice for this part and played it beautifully. The film takes you on a real journey, I was captivated the whole way through."
" Wes Anderson's Masterpiece
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a brilliant film by Wes Anderson and probably his greatest. There is no other directior that has a more distinctive style than him, so only he can handle this film perfectly. It's very entertaining to watch, and not only is this a nostalgic throwback to the 1930s but also a charming and nice story that gives justice to the source material.In 1932 in the fictional Republic of Zubrowka, The once famous hotel called the Grand Budapest owned by the legendarily funny and interesting Gustave. H. The person who plays Gustave H., is probably one of the greatest performances I have ever seen in a movie, he's funny, rude, mysterious, and hilarious, he should have been nominated for an Oscar. And the immigrant lobbyboy Zero is also very funny and interesting. They both form a friendship as the movie progresses. Gustave's girlfriend dies tragically so, he goes pays respect, but her family is evil and rude, so he and Zero steal a very important Oil painting. And then the movie becomes an action adventure, and things get Tarantino-style violent. The reason why the characters are obsessed with the oil painting is because it's the only thing in the movie that isn't Wes Anderson style. BTW Wes really gets carried away with the symmetrical framing and warm colors, but that's what I love about his movies, his movies are original and creative. The actors who play Gustave and Zero do respective jobs, but we also get equally hilarious performances from Adrian Brody, Jeff Goldblum, Willam Defoe, Edward Norton, the list goes on.This film looks like an oil painting. Brilliant work of art.Masterpiece."
" Naive tale (PG-18)
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,8,"Pros: all the characters are perfectly played (they will be remembered for a long time), puppety, which was not in any film before, a good storyMinuses: a little boring, average graphics.
Minuses: a little boring , average graphic."
" One of the Best Ever
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,10,"This is my third favorite movie ever. It looks amazing, great screenplay, great acting, and with the best score ever. It also has my favorite movie character: Gustave H. This movie takes all the great things from other Wes Anderson movies and takes all the worst things out. It's kind of disappointing Ralph Fiennes wasn't nominated for an oscar."
" An outlandish masterpiece
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,10,"A funny exciting adventure brought to life by a great cast. If you want to sit at home and get lost for 1hr 39mins this is your man. Excellent acting, directing and production! A weirdly wonderful experience."
" I love it
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,8,"Keeps your eyes with the movie all time, even when the matter is serious it is able to show it in simple and light way.I like the way they move on the screen ... like Old days movies.:)"
" One of those overrated films
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,3,"You know the type: Birdman or The Shape of Water, etc Films that make no sense and are largely boring too."
" A compelling piece from beginning to end.
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,10,"I have just watched the Grand Budapest Hotel (and grand it is, indeed) for the first time and I was wowed beyond expectation. I must admit that I do take prior IMDb ratings into account before watching a movie and I was impressed by this film's high appraisal. Also keeping in mind the noise made by this movie a few years ago at the Oscars, I entered this movie with quite high expectations. This film is nicely paced, and instantly I was put into a trance by the beautifully designed set. I must give credit to Anna Pinnock and Adam Stauckhausen, they rightfully deserved the Academy award for production design on this film. This film is simply beautiful to the eye. This aspect is nicely complimented by the intricate and aesthetically pleasing costume design. The star-studded cast definitely positively impacted my experience. I appreciated the smaller roles played by A-list actors such as Owen Wilson and Bill Murray (Wes Anderson regulars) and others including Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton. The acting in this movie is stellar, especially considering that this type of film/performance is not often seen by mainstream present-day audiences. This is not necessarily your run-of-the-mill movie, but in my opinion that is not a bad thing. Although not typical, I would say most movie-going audiences would enjoy this film as I did. The Grand Budapest Hotel balances just the perfect amount of bizarreness, creativity, sentimentality, independency, and story-telling ability to craft a one of a kind piece that will stay with you long after the credits roll."
" The best comedy of the 21st century
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,8,"This show is amazing. The acting is superb, the plot is convulated, absurd but captivating. The film is also filled with humour, sometimes dark. Wes Anderson really did a good job."
" Charming and entertaining
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,6,This movie is a story told by one of the fictional characters that is in a fictional country and lives in fictional hotel. The scenes were just jumps in the story but comes in the appropriate order.. The characters do not tell jokes BUT the ordinary and sometimes the not so ordinary behavior the characters do that make it funny along with the an unexpected sequence of events. This movie is so colorful with clear spoken language and shot in attractive way.
" BOY WITH APPLE
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,10,"Not since ""The Book Thief"" have I been so entertained by a movie that knows how to create art. Rather than mention the plot, I will say that the language flowed with grace and humor. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) our main character had the ability to be classy while being crude. The harpsichord soundtrack fit well into the production. One could see where classical action/comedy/romance films of the 50's and 60's have influenced the film until it spoofs them in a generic fashion. Even minor characters like Saoirse Ronan are carefully crafted with odd flaws, such as her facial birthmark shaped like Mexico.Gustave describes sex as ""eating steak."" His affairs with older women he claims, ""The cheaper cuts are more flavorful."" He is also a lover of poetry and writes poems and speaks poetically with a way that amuses the audience.While the film has a classic look and sound to it, the humor is suited for a younger audience."
" it's funny and heartwarming
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,9,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a sweet adventure that will warm your heart, wes anderson knows how make a emotional scene even with a cartoony tone and cartoony characters, the acting is great especially with Ralph Fiennes, the way this movie is shot is amazing it's shot like it's in the time period and wes anderson uses the the practical effects used at the time and uses Aspect Ratio that were used at the time, my only problems is that some of the actors are underused like Bill Murray and Tilda Swinton and there was that one scene where there was an old naked woman but thats the only problems with the movie, overall the movie was amazing you will love it."
" A fun movie with a lot of Wes Anderson wit
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,9,"If you like Wes Anderson, you will love this movie. Witty, entertaining and pleasant, it is a comedy in his unique style, that hits all the tones and notes that make him a unique and original director."
" Old World Charm Never Goes Out of Fashion
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,8,"I've found that amongst movie-goers Wes Anderson seems to be a bit polarizing. I'm one of those folks that falls somewhere in the middle regarding his work. I had modest expectations for The Grand Budapest Hotel but have to say I enjoyed it immensely. All of the performances are good and all of the characters are so unique and interesting. Each of them is unique in a way that for me was real and believable, and therefor someone I could relate to. In particular I found the Lobby Boy and his loyalty to the Fiennes character very endearing. Visually it was continually interesting and the hotel, along with the decor, and mannerisms of this film did have an elegant, reserved, old-world feel to it, which added a new dimension to my enjoyment."
" One of my favorites!!
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,10,"Nominated for 213 awards and winning 125, this is an absolute gem of a film. It is a rare find that is perfect on every level. There simply can not be any doubt as to why the film won so many awards. The storytelling and humor is uniquely different! I was spellbound and mesmerized from beginning to end. Impeccable dialogue. A masterpiece! This is one of my all-time favorite movies."
" Absolute perfection.
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,10,"This is what filmmaking is all about. The acting, script and cinematography are perfect. 
Don't miss this one."
" a wonderful caper brimming with pleasant marvel
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,9,"This is simply another marvelously crafted piece, specifically the 8th, by auteur Wes Anderson, whose artistic flavor and ability manifest in its meticulously arranged camerawork and grandiose sets, the rich nature of the soundtrack, and the gliding pace, given even more vitality by the performances of a straight-up stupendous cast. The combined presentation is phenomenal, I'll argue. From the opening shot, all attention is placed on the scenery, a motley of color and positively baroque environments. From the floridity of the Grand Budapest Hotel to the brutalist nature of the prison, there's intense mise en scène all around; Wes Anderson did incrediblely well to build a world, boxy yet vast. All of this is well-framed under the lucid camerawork, a sort of hovering betta delicately absorbing both the most penitent scenes and most beautiful scenery at once as it follows the cast throughout, as they indulge in their eccentricity and plots, to the tune of the balalaika-heavy soundtrack, which can range from bubblingly mellow to bubblingly anxious. The acting is mostly underplayed but by no means diluted; the humor and general dialogue is executed in a natural yet purposeful cadence, coupled with fluid motion. I've had a couple of chortles watching, and was heavily invested throughout. I honestly can't recommend this enough. Now, issues some might have: The plot acts only as a vehicle for all other facets of the film itself, and by extension the characters may come across as superficial. I honestly don't view this as a defect; I figured the intention was to impress the audience with an absurd caper and enjoyed it greatly under that assumption. All the same, because of this, the film is sorta hit-or-miss, depending on what you're looking for or to resonate with. I suppose most of all Wes Anderson films are. Still, I recommend giving this a watch, if only to appreciate the style that penetrates this film immensely."
" Unlike anything else!
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,9,"This film is the true definition of ""you cant judge a book by its cover"" because I genuinely believed I was going to hate this film when I originally saw it over 4 years ago. The experience of watching this film was breath-taking and stayed with me for ages and even still today its brings a smile to my face and a sense of enjoyment.Strangely before seeing the film I had not heard of Wes Anderson as a film maker, his name had never really come up before, however I would never forget his name afterwards. This film is truly remarkable start to finish, from the star studded cast to the fantastical journey this film takes, every part is immaculate. I was and am still astounded by the directing style of Anderson especially in this film, it fits so well with the story begin told and the time period. I have no idea the technical term for his camera movements and style but its quite unlike anything else I have ever seen still to this day. Absolutely incredibly achievement.The story is a fantastical adventure that has so many twists and turns, keeping the flow and the rhythm of the film at a perfect pace. In essence this film is a story of a hotel from the perspective of an long time employee/owner, set back against this magical wonderland that is perfect. The story does get very complex with all the moving parts and the amount of characters that are dotted throughout it, truly brilliant. The story is propelled by the incredible dialogue which is mesmerising, it is a fantastic mixture of language of the day with a modern twist here and there. Some of the wittiest dialogue I have ever heard. I cant imagine the time it took to come up with the script for this film.The cast are all superb nobody has an off day, there are some many names to chose from but there are a couple of standouts. Obviously Ralph Fiennes is truly remarkable and a role that was perfectly suited for him. It is straight to think because in theory the character doesn't really match up with what you expect with Fiennes, but wow is he incredible. Did he get nominated for any awards?? The other standout has to be Tony Revolori who is just brilliant as ""Zero"" witty but innocent at the same time, the character becomes more and more like Gustave H, (Fiennes), as the film progresses. Really good performance. The last two positives are the effects and the score. The effects used in this film to either show the landscape or the action scenes are purposely made to look dated as if the film was actually made during the time period. The skiing montage is truly fascinating as to how they achieved the look, the same must be said for Willem Dafoe riding on the motorbike. All of the landscapes of the film are like water paintings rather than a physical location or CG which only adds to the unique quirkiness of the film. The last positive is the score which is really good, quite haunting and sombre at the same time, the sort of thing that would be played at a funeral. (I'm taking about the choir part of the score).Overall 95% out of 100 or 9.5 out of 10, Wes Anderson has made a film that was break-taking and helped to form my own opinion about film. He still is on my radar still to this day as a director to look out for, saying that I didn't see ""Isle of Dogs"" oops. This film is for everyone and it will make you smile, laugh and cry. This is the reason why I love film, magically brilliant in all its quirkiness."
" cake movie
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,9,"What a lovely n incredible film it is! I'm truly amazed by its beautiful scenes n ironic story. It may look just like a perfect cake, but you can hardly know how dark n cruel in its making process behind the pretty surface. And the movie exactly show it."
" (A must watch art film
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,8,"Once again Wes Anderson shows why he is one of the very rare selected few auteurs whose vision can easily be recognized. Grand Budapest Hotel is a fantastic fim- quirky as any other Anderson outing, and ably acted by everyone from usual Anderson stock to new faces like Jeff Goldblum Jude Law and Willem Defoe. (A must watch art film)"
" A Top 100 Film of All Time
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,10,"I write a yearly book for listing 2000 of the best films of all time at Amazon. This film not only makes my top 2000, it makes my top 100, which is very difficult to do. And I do not usually give out tens for ratings as well. A ten represents a perfect film, which this is. Films like Cinema Paradiso, Lawrence of Arabia, Lost Horizon, and The Producers get 10s. This is a comedy as good as The Producers.
The actors in this film really stay in character, and no one hams it up. Brody came close, but his role called for someone over the top. Everyone else was extremely professional and low-key. It's the best thing that Goldblum has ever done. And several of the cameos are absolutely first-rate. This is a film not to be missed by any serious filmgoer. Fiennes deserved an Oscar for this role.Dr. Arthur H Tafero

" artsy and humerous, but what in the hell did i watch?
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,6,"I heard of it being a classic must-watch, so i watched it. It's one of those movies that apparantly requires a certain taste for the lightheartidly absurd, if I had to describe it as anything. It borderlines arthouse material, with every single scene being centered to the last inch. If anything, this movie continues to grab your attention by putting every character, in ever moment dead-center. You have no idea if this even takes place on planet earth, or in a parallel reality. The country in which it takes place is somethting vaguely German-European and when there is a sporadic mention of a war -an element that is marketed to be a key plot point but really the movie is the same if it were without it - they even go as far as renaming SS to ZZ. I mean... what? The story doesn't have much to it - it's a man telling a story, about another man telling a story on how he was the protegé of an esteemed congierge of the dubious hotel. How said hotel has fallen into ruin in the first place is hardly mentioned, and the story that you'd expect - about the hotel itself you'd presume - becomes a weird tale on art thieves, a dead widow and a shady testament. Could be fun, and it kinda is, but the manner in which it all is told is silly to say the least. Something monty-python like posh slapstick humour almost. So yeah, weird and silly, but strangely amusing at the same time. Still wondering why the hell some characters were portrayed as being a vampire or werewolf without ANY reason for them to be those things in this premis! 
 
All in all: masterpiece? naah. The only thing masterpiece worthy here is the acting. Too bad Tilda Swinton had such a short role - I love that woman in every role she plays! Ralph Fiennes' posh but foul-mouthed caharcter is a delight, there are some teeny tiny roles for Owen Wilson and Bill Murray and Tony Revolori has a very endearing character. They amused me well anough for leaving this movie a positive review but other than that it just left me confused."
" Such a delightful film.
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,10,"My time spent reviewing the film here will be brief as it would be pointless to describe how much I love this film here. Great cinematography, score, acting, and of course directing. The mood is such a warm and friendly place to be, fitting that it should be named after a grand hotel. Love the use of aspect ratio. Every character is utilized to perfection and never overstays their welcome, leaving you completely satisfied in their conclusion. A great film."
" Different kind of storytelling
",2018-04-09 00:00:00,9,"I liked story of film. kind of beginning and ending the film was really inventive. 
Of course, I though story is deceptive and incomplete (sometimes), but it is still justifiable.
finally, you can enjoy from all minutes that will drown you in a fantastic piece of a person's life."
" Charming, Funny, Brilliant
",2018-04-05 00:00:00,9,"Every moment of this is fantastic. All of the characters have something special about themselves. Whether it's Dmitri and his gang who are quite frightening. Mr. Gustave who steals every scene he's in, or Zero who's awkwardness makes him a great suppor to Gustave and even better when he's on his own. They all come together to form one truly unforgettable and entertaining film that will be a classic in the years to come."
" Fiennes at his finest
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,7,"I totally understand some people find this movie boring, shallow, pretentious, all style and no substance etc. I'm not a huge fan of Wes Anderson and would have felt the same if it had not for one outstanding factor: Ralph Fiennes. He is spectacular here. I never thought he had so much comedic chop in him. He carries the whole movie almost single-handed, perfectly playing the haughty and suave but hopelessly insecure and lonely concierge. Forget other stellar cast, who play more or less cardboard cliche characters. Forget cinematography and production design, which are very pretty but unrealistic. For me this film was worth watching because of the amazing performance by the lead actor. I have to add that young Tony Revolori as the lobby boy was equally great. Together, the two make one of the best ""buddies"" in movies I've seen in recent years."
" the very best of Wes Anderson
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,8,"Wes Anderson is a master at using limited, but powerful color palettes, fast, witty dialogue, and character driven plots to create beautiful worlds with beautiful stories. He has never done better than The Grand Budapest Hotel. The Grand Budapest follows the adventure of M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) and his lobby boy, Zero (Tony Revolori) as they ""steal"" a priceless painting and try to find the missing second will of Madame D. (Tilda Swinton). We are told the story through the perspective of the Author (Jude Law) who is told the story through the perspective of Mr. Moustafa (F. Murray Abraham). The film is rounded out with Anderson's usual cast of unusual characters; Bob Balaban, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson with one time collaborator Saoirse Ronan.The film's pastel palette adds to the visual look with the bright pinks and reds of the hotel at its peak in the 30s and the muted oranges and greens of the hotel well passed its prime in the 60s. The comedic one-liners of M. Gustave parallel the more somber tones of Mr. Moustafa to combine to make a script that is sure to make you laugh and maybe even make you tear up at the end. The movie would not be complete without the beautiful score created by Alexandre Desplat which includes fast pace guitar with slow piano playing that add to the tones of both the 30s and 60s timelines."
" An inspiring movie
",2018-03-14 00:00:00,10,I saw the movie four years after its release and I was mesmerized by all the hidden plots it revealed. I am grateful for Wes Anderson for producing & directing it and for giving me many things to think about and for greatly entertaining me...Robert Breneman
" Shifts in Society and Ski Resorts
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,9,"In his latest film, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Wes Anderson does an incredible job of telling an ugly story taking place in an even uglier time in a beautiful and light-hearted way. Receiving a 93% rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, The Grand Budapest Hotel is not only loved by fans, but also critically acclaimed. Taking place in the 1930s, the movie tells the story of a lobby boy, Zero, and his mentor, M.Gustave. M. Gustave manages a fantastical ski resort where he spends time meeting the needs of the hotel's old, rich, blonde occupants. Coming from zero, Zero is an immigrant who fled his war-ridden home to come to Zubrowka, the fictional European country in which the film is set.
 Alongside the adventures of Zero and M. Gustave is another story: that of the violent shift of culture in Western Europe during the World Wars. When the movie starts, it depicts a society of structure, nobility, and social hierarchy. From the beginning, Anderson portrays a hierarchy even within the hotel, with M. Gustave near the top, staying in a grand room with a grand bed, and Zero at the very bottom, living in a room the size of a closet. Everyone treats each other with respect, and everyone knows their place in society. Everything is structured. As the movie progresses, this theme is still apparent, yet things begin to change. For example, while traveling, Zero and M. Gustave's train is stopped in the middle of a barley field. It is then boarded by militarized police, who are seemingly ready to arrest Zero for lack of legal documentation. However, before they can do anything, they are stopped by their chief, who is a friend of M. Gustave's and gives Zero a note stating he is legally allowed in the country. This scene hints at the shift in the current society. At the end of the film, the plot makes it apparent that the shift in culture is nearly complete when a similar train scene is displayed, with Zero and M. Gustave's train car stopped again, but this time it is boarded by a stand-in for an SS death squad. Yet again, they are about to arrest Zero, but this time M. Gustave hands them the letter from their last barley field pullover. A member of the death squad proceeds to shred the note and bash Zero with the butt of his gun, symbolizing the near completion of the shift in society. 
 The beauty of the cinematography ude of a light-spirited sense of humor, although contrasting the ugly themes portrayed in the film, make the movie very charming. The excellent use of still and tracking shots, symmetry, colors, and beautiful sets allows for a stunning style of film that grants each shot an oil painting look. For example, at the beginning of the film, Anderson launches a colorful long shot of the hotel, giving a sense of its size and grandeur, followed by a tracking shot from the gondolas all the way through the resort, displaying the world it contains. Additionally, the humor is consistently subtle and funny, with skits ranging from the mysterious Society of the Crossed Keys, to the hunt for a strange yet priceless painting, Boy With Apple. The inclusion of humor and cheery tones in the film allow The Grand Budapest Hotel to be very enjoyable and fun to watch, even though the film tells a story of violence in a violent time."
" One of the best films of 2014
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,9,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is fantastic. Wes Anderson puts so much work into every film he's made. He's a great filmmaker, and he has really out done himself here. The style and cinematography always matches the time period and place. His style is amazing. He uses lighting and shot placement to establish emotions in a very affective way. Every shot is symmetrical and every pan, or zoom, or tracking shot is mastered and used to great affect. He makes intentional mistakes and uses different aspect ratios so he can make you feel like you are watching a film from whatever time period the scene is taking place in. Ralph Fiennes is great in this movie. I think he gave the best male performance of 2014, and he was snubbed. Anyway besides the style , the comedic script is very good. The way it sets the tone, it really is an escape from reality. The only (very minor) complaint is that there was one sequence where they used CGI which would have been betterif they used practical effects. Other than that it was an absolute joy to watch and I will defiantly be watching it again. I give it a 10/10"

" The best film of 2014
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,10,"I love me some Wes Anderson. I'm very biased towards the dude and his work so take everything I say with a grain of salt. The cast is freaking amazing. Ralph Fiennes, Saoirse Ronan, Jeff Goldblum, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, F. Murray Abraham, and Edward Norton? Sign me the hell up. All of them do great and no one scene is stolen completely by any one actor. The cast isn't the only amazing thing about this movie, the Soundtrack is also great. The Cinematography by Robert Yeoman is a treat for the eyes, as Yeoman has a real skill for the details. I could down the list of all the reasons I love this film, but I don't wanna be that verbose."
" The beginning of the end of the end of the beginning has begun! (Spoiler free review)
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,8,I went in to this movie not knowing anything about its plot or story. I only knew it was about the adventures of some hero from a Budapest Hotel. Honestly I didn't think this movie was going to be any good since its plot wasn't that much interesting but I though I'd give it a try since it was the only movie from the 2015 Oscars highlights I didn't saw. Now I can say that I was not wrong because this movie succeeds as a comedy with some absurd scenes that had me laughing very hard and with characters that are really well done. Aside from that this movie in my opinion had some issues. Mainly the story is very weird told and I was bored for most of the movie although I understood the main thing of the movie and this whole adventure Gustavo and Zero had. The movie never emphasised the characters who were important to the story... I get the movie had to be absurdly funny but you need to catch the viewer's attention with a plot that can be followed and interesting and characters that are introduced properly. I was continuously asking myself who's this? who's that? because the movie's story went on like I was supposed to know who those characters were. But putting that aside there were things I liked like the absurd humor that sometimes had me laughing very hard and the way the movie was constructed. It's been told like a multi-layered story that goes from present to the past with 4 levels of story which made it really interesting in that perspective. Apart from that there were some extremely well done scenes and the movie as a whole was very colorful with some of the best cinematography (I honestly would have given the oscar for cinematography to this movie not to Birdman) although I literally can't understand how Interstellar was not nominated that year. Overall a funny movie with some interesting characters and a multi-layered story and absurd humor. 8/10
" From Zero to Hero.
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,10,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is quaint, both story-wise and visually. Characters are memorable and charming, even the antagonists.It's a Wes Anderson film through and through, and one of the most endearing films I've ever seen."
" the movie tries hard but fails
",2018-01-13 00:00:00,1,"The Grand Budapest Hotel tries hard to be charming, mysterious, funny and dramatic at the same time but doesn't quite achieve the goal. Plainly, it's just an ensemble of American stereotypes of ,,europeanness'' all put together in one pot. A bit more accuracy (like Tarantino) could have helped. Instead, there are tons of references to historical events, all slightly altered and often very randomly put together. 
In addition to that, there's a lot of completely unnecessary violence. As for the ,,funny'' scenes - I didn't laugh once. Maybe, if you're not familiar with European history and don't mind the completely random mixing of historical references (and accents) you might enjoy this movie - otherwise it's a complete failure.What a waste of a good plot!"
" Greatest comedy
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,9,"For me this was the greatest comedy with a special kind of humor.
The makeup was great, the actors were chosen well and the action is very exciting.

great actors!"
" Another exceptional addition to Anderson's cannon
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"I'm not sure I can say much more about Wes Anderson that hasn't already been said - he's definitely one of the most singular filmmakers of our generation. Needless to say, if you liked 'The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou', 'The Darjeeling Limited' and 'Moonrise Kingdom' (which I did), then you'll enjoy 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. It's got a huge ensemble cast, but the usual faces (Murray, Schwartzman, Norton, Wilson) are only given bit parts, with Gustave (Fiennes) the undisputed central character here.Even though it's named after the hotel, only about half the film takes place there - and when it does, it looks fantastic, with the colour and framing. They do a great job of telling the film as a back story, allowing Zero (Revolori/Abraham) to be our eyes and ears into the hotel's - and Gustave's - past. It's a fascinating story, with plenty of laughs, but also a decent murder-mystery/chase film packed in there. This is aided immensely by Adrien Brody & Willem Dafoe playing the ""badguys"".Everything flows nicely, there's precise dialogue (as always), a great score and great set/costume design. Goldblum's great as the lawyer and used really effectively. I can't really say much more - it's a really well-made and enjoyable film!"
" An excellent story with a disappointing ending
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,9,"An old man tells the story of his youth at the famous hotel to a young writer, together with its adventures and perils which ultimately led to his position in the present day. Then, he worked as a lobby boy for a very odd but perfectionist concierge, which involuntary gets involved in a dodgy testament, filled with crimes and murders.Their adventures are told in an unique way, funny, entertaining and unpredictable, having a hard time keeping even a single moment of sobriety. Although interesting most of the time with its dark atmosphere, it disappoints me with its simplistic and inconclusive finale. Its actors play superbly, especially the concierge, which puts a lot of soul and hard work into his character. It's a very good movie, worthy of an Oscar nominee, if not more, which brings some well-rounded characters and together with a good story, managing to create a truly great movie, if you count out the ending."
" The Grand Movie
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,10,"Wes Anderson does it again by creating a movie that puts movie making back on the map! Watching this movie will stimulate all of your senses all at once. I could feel, see and taste the movie as I was watching it!!!!!! These types of movies are not for the faint of heart and the faint of laughter! Watch, see, feel, enjoy!"
" Quick paced, quirky and hard to take your eyes off
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,9,"I tend to avoid finding out too much about the actual plot of movies I'm going to watch as possible, as I am easily distracted and it helps me focus on the story. As with most Wes Andersson movies though it turned out I really had no need to worry - whatever I thought I had figured the movie to be about beforehand was not even close to what I'd find.
The movie didn't have a single slow moment, always something going on. Camera angles, colouration and characters are quirky and swift as is Wes' characteristics. I'm not the biggest fan of Anderson myself, though I did also enjoy Moonrise Kingdom which this movie do have similarities too both in how the story is told and the characters, but this is a movie I believe will do well even with the people that might not be into the slower, more artsy movies. Not only is it pretty to look at but there is also an epic adventure taking place that keep your eyes glued to the screen."
" A visually stunning interpretation of a coming of age story
",2017-12-06 00:00:00,10,"he Grand Budapest Hotel is the story of Zero Moustafa, played by F. Murray Abraham and Tony Revolori, and his adventures with M. Gustave, played by Ralph Finnes. The story revolves around the death of a wealthy patron, Selene Villanova DeGoeff und Taxis played by Tilda Swinton, and the ensuing adventures created by the disposition of her estate. At its heart, this is a coming of age story but instead of the usual formula of a young person finding their way in the world we have a maturing of both main characters in as they are forced to confront a changing world out of their control. From the view point of our main character Zero, this is a classic young hero motif as he seeks to create his own future by emulating his new-found hero, M. Gustave and gain some entry into the closed luxurious world of The Grand Budapest Hotel. In contrast, M. Gustave matures throughout the movie and his interactions with Zero as he begins to realize he may care about something other than himself and his wealthy patrons, namely his protégé Zero. The genius of Wes Anderson is truly on display in this film as he brings these two characters closer together of the course of several adventures and interactions. This is best illustrated in the contrast between the linked scenes in the train stopped in a barley field. The first time this happens and violence ensues M. Gustave shouts, ""Get your hands off my lobby boy"" while the second time he says, ""Get your hands off him"". As can be seen from the difference in phrasing the two main characters have grown together in a significant way. Wes Anderson has been honing this thematic technique throughout his career with movies such as ""The Life Aquatic"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" which are essentially movies about identity and discovering one's self in a world which one may not fit in. In The grand Budapest Hotel, he takes his vision to new heights by creating a world unto itself using nearly recognizable events and places. While there is no place called Zubrowka or Lutz, Anderson creates a believable setting using words like Sudeten and an ominous organization, the Zig Zag, symbolized by a ZZ. These subtle ques and Wes Anderson ability to create a unique world in extreme detail makes this a rich setting but the vague familiarity of it allows the viewer to concentrate on the story and the characters. With universal themes of discovery and coming of age presented in a fresh way and through the vivid expression of the director, this film waits patiently to be a classic for all time."
" Difficult...
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,6,"I think this movie achieved almost perfectly what it was going for. My problem is, that I don't like what it was going for. This whole style of the movie feels so choreographed and unnatural, and I know this is part of the comedy, but it just kept me from really connecting to it. But it actually got better with its run-time."
" A pleasure to watch
",2017-11-17 00:00:00,10,"This film is like spending an hour and a half in your grandparent's attic. It takes our romantic understandings of the era to create a hyper-exaggerated version of reality, that is only possible if we take the things that don't matter too seriously, and ridicule the grandiose. Despite its rather unimaginative plot, the setting only emphasizes its dry humour and lively camera-work. A real joy to watch."
" Wes Anderson
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,10,"Wes Anderson is not for everyone. At this point, his films are an acquired taste, and there's enough of a body of work for people to make up their minds whether they like the brand of hand-made, exquisitely carved life-sized doll houses he's selling (if you told me a major director was also a serial killer, my first guess would be Wes Anderson). I happen to be an avid Anderson fan, but I don't argue with people who aren't. His bouts of whimsy are prone to self- indulgence, and his austere emotionalism can be hard to connect with. He's a tremendous filmmaker but he isn't invincible—The Life Aquatic is self-indulgent, The Darjeeling Limited is just plain bad. Still, Wes Anderson on his worst day is better than 98% of working directors on their best.The Grand Budapest Hotel is Wes Anderson working on a very, very good day."
" Intelligent and refreshingly original.
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,10,"When it came to comedy in my younger days, I always watched movies that make me howl with laughter like Ace Ventura or Animal House, but when my parents recommended The Grand Budapest Hotel, I watched the trailer and it peaked my interest and I later watched it and absolutely adored it. From it's ingenious writing and glorious visuals to it's comedy and acting, this is what so many modern comedies aspire to be and yet always fail.The movie opens in modern day where a young woman reads from a book by an author who vacationed at a run-down hotel in the Republic of Zubrowka called The Grand Budapest Hotel in the 1960s where he encounters the owner named Moustafa who tells him the story of how he inherited the hotel. We are than again thirsted back to 1932 where the Grand Budapest's attendant, M. Gustave is busily attending to the desires of the hotel's rich customers as well as educating Moustafa who is the hotel's new lobby boy, but when a favorite client of his is killed under questionable conditions, he is framed for killing her and is placed under arrest but is able to escape. Now, Gustave and Zero must clear his name and reclaim what is rightfully his.While on the surface, the movie may seem like a zany comedy with a murder thrown in for good measure, it's actually a series of arranged events in which many people tell the story of M. Gustave over the years while the extraordinary intro hints at the boundless creativity of director Wes Anderson. Some viewers might think that it's pointless, but it does give a lot of background when the last title card shows up, summing up the reason for the time skip, but it doesn't let up as the movie is a comical multiple genre journey that never seems to slow down for a breather, but even when it gets to the tense moments, there's always a sense of cheeriness right up until the movie ends. Much like what Quentin Tarantino did with Inglorious Bastards with it's self-awareness and adjusting of history, it's hardly surprising that Wes Anderson added in references to WW II throughout the movie as it's based off of a few books by author Stefan Zweig which adds to the authenticity of the movie not to mention that throughout the movie, the war rushes our heroes and villains to carry out their motives rapidly in order to accomplish their various ambitions which adds to the authenticity of the movie.While the human characters are fascinating, The Grand Budapest Hotel feels like a character itself with its spectacular setting, the baths, the hallways, tall roofs, soft colors and identical carpets and walls all give the viewer a sense of grandeur and awe making the viewer feel like they are actually staying there while the visual landscape and photography is simply gorgeous and not only ingenious in approach but also beautiful in gorgeous and smooth editing not to mention the production design, the clothes, hair and make-up all justly earned their Oscar wins as they encompass a distinctively bright and enchanted aura to them while at the same time giving meaning to the gloomy aspect that mirrors the crime drama characteristics of the movie wonderfully. The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is also wonderful with its memorably compelling and captivating musical themes while the film's score crafts a whole new setting for the movie's characters to thrive in and the themes for the various characters are just as attention-grabbing. While the movie has an undercurrent of seriousness, it's still a laugh riot and there's pretty to chuckle at in the movie from Gustave's prison breakout scene to him and Zero fleeing across the snow. The characters are portrayed to such excessiveness that it's impossible not to be entertained by watching them in spite of the dangers they face, the witting too is marvelous with plenty of hilarious lines that are bound to make you laugh your head off more times than once during the movie.To make the movie complete, Anderson recruited one of the best ensemble casts for a comedy I've ever seen and everyone is perfect in their roles. Saoirse Ronan is wonderful as pastry chef Agatha, Tilda Swinton leaves a wonderful impression as Madame D and gives a fine performance, Jeff Goldblum is fantastic as a doomed attorney, Bill Murray is great in his role as is Owen Wilson, Edward Norton is great as the police chief, F. Murray Abraham is wonderful as the older Moustafa, Adrian Brody is awesome as Madame D's conniving son while Willem Defoe is perfect as the evil and brutal psychopath especially when he's standing in the shadows and endangers unsuspecting targets. Ralph Fiennes is fabulous as M. Gustave and brings his familiar endurance to this outlandishly bizarre character, but in a comical curve puts on a formal yet amusingly vulgar witty persona that is more than captivating and there's no absence of hilarious dialog coming from his mouth as he spouts passionate poetry, biting banter or distasteful fits of swearing, truly one of the finest comedic performances of the decade. Assisting in Ralph's crazy adventures is the inexperienced yet ever devoted Zero, perfectly acted by Tony Revolori who brings a dash of boyish zazz to the role as Zero learns his surroundings, but we do learn about his troubled past later on in the film not to mention the interaction between him and Fiennes is so heart-melting as it feels like a father-son relationship by the movie's end.Honestly, there's nothing else I can say about the Grand Budapest Hotel, it's a wonderful comedy that provides plenty of laugh-out-lord moments but still manages to stand above most other comedy movies by being intelligent with it's writing, characters and humor, so if you want a comedy movie that won't insult your intelligence than this is your movie."
" An unusual film, just not to my taste
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,5,"'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a rarity in the world of film in that there's nothing really like it out there. It's one of a kind and is near impossible to categorise, let alone describe. It's a fascinating film to watch due to its sheer weirdness, but it's also divisive in that some people will love it and others just wont see what all the fuss is about.I'm probably somewhere between the two - on the fence if you like. I was entertained for most of the film, but the story did nothing for me and neither did the humour. For all its style, the film lacks a solid and coherent plot and ends up just being a silly and shallow little adventure.Its quirky and weird nature makes it memorable, but it's a film I'll only ever watch once. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is an unusual film, but just not to my taste."
" Absence of substance
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,5,"I have to admit I don't understand the appeal of Wes Anderson's films. It's not just that I don't like them very much - I'm not a great fan of superhero movies either, but I can comprehend the sensibility that they appeal to. But Anderson's movies, so widely feted, leave be not only cold, but mystified. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', for example, conjures up beautifully a comically rendered vision of Mitteleuropean splendour fading into Nazism and communism in a way that should appeal to me. But in that world, Anderson tells a one-note story devoid of any human depth. To contrast, consider a movie like 'Delicatessan', for example, which is also set in a tragi-comic alternative world; but which tells a story full of very real emotion. To me, the richness of that movie's reality is light years away from the complete shallowness of Anderson's work. As I said, it's as if there's something that's sailing completely over my head; either that, or there's an audience completely unconcerned by the absence of substance. But I'm not part of it."
" The most excellent tale, told in the most beautiful way
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,10,"The story of the Grand Budapest Hotel is told in the most beautiful, artistic and amazing way. Set in four levels based on the story of M.Gustav and Zero, told by an elderly Zeron, a young Author (Jude Law) and his elder self (Tom Wilkinson). Level 2: Author Introduction (Tom Wilkinson) - again very brief, as an old man is to tell the tale of his visit to the Grand Budapest. Level 3: Author Visits Hotel (Jude Law) and meets Zero (F.Murray Abraham) - this is many years after the main story and Zero who is now a lot older is there to tell the tale of how he came to own the hotel, by the visiting Author Level 4: Bell Boy Zero and M'Sieur Gustav (Ralph Fiennes) - the main story. Beautifully told story, it is so amazingly beautiful. M.Gustav is the most wonderful eccentric concierge. The imagery is as beautiful as you can find and you will see similarities between this and The Fantastic Mr Fox. Lastly you will find many familiar faces popping up, including Jeff Goldblum, Tilda Swinton, Willem Dafoe, Léa Seydoux, Adrien Brody, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel and Owen Wilson.It is one of my favourite films ever, simply it has been put together with the finest detail and a quirky fun and elegant tale. I can understand if you don't share this view, but ask you simply listen to the great word play and the fabulous scenery. There are so many great lines. Hope you enjoy it."
" You have to watch it
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,9,"Ralph Fiennes shows why he is considered a great actor! You can easily follow the story, you will understand the characters and most of all you won't feel the time passing by... Isn't this the main reason why movies exist? You will laugh, you may cry and next time you visit an hotel you will remember this staff. 9 out of 10."
" A comedy refined and elegant, but that may not be funny for those looking for easy laughter.
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,10,"This was my first contact with Wes Anderson's cinematographic work, and for the very little I now know (this single film), I believe I can agree with the general opinion that the director is good, very competent but also intellectual, making very good movies that are a little difficult to describe in a nutshell. The film entertains us and we're able to enjoy the refined comedy that we're watching, but we can hardly say that its a movie suitable for all audiences. People looking for something less elegant, a more ""popular"" kind of comedy where humor is easier, may have a hard time noticing the jokes and actually laughing.The veteran Ralph Fiennes is the actor with more protagonism. Needless to say, he again gives proof of unquestionable versatility and gives the public a work of excellent quality. Adrien Brody and Edward Norton were also perfectly up to the characters and their challenge. F. Murray Abraham, Willem Dafoe, Mathieu Amalric, Jeff Goldblum and other actors of enormous weight and prestige enter this film, but their roles are so small that we cannot even call them roles. Most were cameos. Perhaps the director's prestige and the overall quality of the film were the motives that led so many stars to make these small appearances. After all, as the poet said, ""there are no small roles but small actors"" isn't it?"
" Perfect mix of everything
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,9,"The Grand Budapest Hotel has it all: great actors, an interesting story-line, beautiful cinematography, a dreamlike set, and of course a brilliant director. Ralph Fiennes, who played M. Gustave, was the perfect concierge. He not only embraced the intimate role of the concierge, but he somehow ""completed"" those words on the screenplay in a way that most actors could not. I have to say that the entire cast made a stellar performance on this film, but sadly cannot name them all as I would run out of space to write the film review. M. Gustav and Zero's relationship throughout the film was a pleasure to watch. It was funny to see them from the very beginning, when they had first met, to the point where they trusted one another with their lives. In a way, they became the family they'd always missed.If you're a fan of Wes Anderson's style, the colours, the patterns, the comedy, the symmetry, and all that jazz--you won't be disappointed. The sets are beautiful (no wonder they won an Oscar for Production Design) and the costumes are very well put together (another Oscar there).Wes Anderson has created a masterpiece--a literal piece of artwork that will be praised for decades to come."
" Nothing special about this movie
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,1,"Watched the entire movie, and really have nothing great to say about it. It did not catch any attention, the script is mundane, it is definitely over-hyped. It tries to come off as something very special, and with complex narrative, by creating this beautiful atmosphere, but delivers nothing to me. Honestly, 2 hours wasted. I did not find the movie philosophical or in any way profound."
" Delightful and witty
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,9,"The dialogue is so rich that one must stifle glee lest the next bon mot be missed. Tastefully bawdy, filled with innuendo, intellectually low brow and fun. We loved the characters and the old fashioned, very vaudevillian running gags. This is a wonderful film for couples, even a first date, the clever adult inferences were seen somewhat differently by my wife, leading to lively post viewing conversation."
" Visual, Direction, Acting, Dialogues .... this Movie has everything at its best.
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,9,"I have only seen one wes anderson movie until i watched TGBH(it was darjeeling limited : i liked it but it was just only a good enough movie for me) but grand Budapest hotel just blew my mind of. from the very start u get addicted to the movie. this is a movie that should be seen in big screen not in your desktop, because this one provides visuals of that kind. i never even felt a single boring period or any lags. The acting by all the main characters were of top quality. The character development has been done brilliantly, casting was also spot on. Since watching this i have downloaded almost all wes anderson movies. Storywise it has a good story nothing more than that, but instead it was the screenplay, art direction, dialogues, acting which made this movie from good to great. To me one of the best 100mins spent. If you haven't seen it , see it asap because this one you cannot miss."
" Pastel Colors but not from Tim Burton
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,10,"When I first saw The Grand Budapest Hotel, I wasn't acquainted with Wes Anderson.Surprisingly, my first Wes Anderson experience was his best movie ever. After watching I realized that he is the one that I'm looking for.The cinematography,colors, musics,casting everything was awesome.I have watched immediately all of his movies in a week. This week was probably one of the best week in my life. If we are going to talk about movie-it's typical Wes Anderson movie- You may think that it's simple and average movie from its plot summary, but Wes Anderson movies don't provide meaning from the point of script view. The real meaning of Wes Anderson movies was hidden in its visuals."
" Attractive picture book
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,9,"As soon as I saw the poster of the movie, I was captured by its unique and artistic colors and picture. And as a person who especially enjoy mystery films, I couldn't not watch it. And it was as good as I thought it would be, or even better. There is a unique aura throughout the movie that takes the viewer into a different world- one like a fairy tale or a picture book because of its cinematography and effects. (Although it wouldn't be at all for children) The color scheme is beautiful and very visually appealing. Although the story might be predictable and the development of it slightly sudden and unusual and even boring to some people, it is entertaining and it was not tedious at all for me with its short running time. There are many scenes that are darkly comical and it's almost like you're in a game in some scenes such as when they escape prison and are being chased. Like this, this movie is truly peculiar and is not just a commercial film. It's beautiful and attractive like a piece of art."
" Tricks and Treats...
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,9,"In a fictional country whose name might earn 100 points on the Scrabble, one of these typical points in the map that started the century in the Austrian-Hungarian splendor and ended up in Soviet austerity, there is a hotel. In this hotel that used to be the place-to-be to all the visitors from Europe, there was a professional, no-nonsense but not without a debonair quality of his own, concierge, his name was Gustav. He had a lust for aging blonde socialites, and from the way he explains it, it's something that requires the taste of a gourmet.There's also a timid but motivated lobby boy named Zero, a baker named Mendl, a murder, a jail sentence, inheritance, family plots and many other ingredients of a real pastry of movie whose story and tone will get over the heads of those who expect something with a plot. Well, that's not what the film is about, it has the old-fashioned charm of Golden Age Hollywood movies, but with a sense of self-conscious wit that gives it a modern touch of originality. It is weird, it is old, you wouldn't believe this is a 2014 movie but like Gustav' tastes, it takes a gourmet to appreciate it.There's something delightfully refreshing in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" in the way it doesn't call for any particular analysis, and provides nothing that can encourage your mind to venture into intellectual considerations. This film is meant for pure visual and narrative entertainment and all you have to do is imagining yourself checking in a hotel where all your wishes will be granted, you don't even have to think, it's all in the 'wait and see' premise.There's also a leitmotif in the film consisting on a delicious pastry, from renowned baker Mendl, who looks and tastes good and is so appealing in any way that when it is sent to a jail pensioner, the man in charge of checking if there's no outbreak device hidden in food, doesn't even let his butcher knife spoil the visuals. This is almost a metaphor to Wes Anderson's aesthetic power, one you don't want to butcher with 'thinking'. You don't need and you shouldn't, because if you try, you're likely to find yourself in some sort of private joke you're the only one not to get.So, embrace that big joke of a film, that shaggy-dog story where each shot, looks like the vignette of a comic-book, enjoy the dry with of Ralph Fiennes in his greatest comedic performance since ""In Bruges"" and don't take the whole thing seriously. The only serious aspect about it is that the film is a visual masterpiece with a unique use of colors, contrasts and environment shots, Anderson is a director, who like Jeunet in ""Amélie"" knows how to make people move in an environment, whether a hotel lobby, a jail or a mountain. Actually, he even know how to make them static, in the middle of a frame, looking at the camera but never breaking the fourth wall, quite a stunt, really.Other moments come in mind, an exchange of punches that look like the frame never moves yet three or four guys end up on the floor, there's a suspenseful moment over a ravine where a man breaks the ice to make Gustav fall only to be thrown away and fall while spinning like in a Tex Avery cartoon. The juxtapositions between shots is another trick cherished by Anderson, a group of escaping prisoners look down over a hole they just opened, the next shot features the exact opposite with guards. I mentioned comic-books, the film's story board would have made a terrific one. The uses of costume is another aspect that immediately associates the film with the animated world, nothing is too wacky or over-the-top if it means a great-looking shot or a hilarious gag, or both.The film is also known for his ensemble star-cast and indeed, it's part of the publicity, it would take a whole paragraph to list all the actors, but the thing is that the film owes them nothing, they're giving their best shot even for a few minutes of screen-time (Bill Murray doesn't have more than a minute but he steals that minute) because they know the film is good enough to have fun with it. It was Ebert who mentioned in his show with Siskel that there was nothing better than seeing actors having fun with their characters, the film would highlight that 'fun' aspect. We know actors love rely on disguises, phony accents and go beyond their usual method acting just to make fun of their own shtick. That's how refreshing the tone of Anderson is. The film would garner 11 Oscar nominations, the most with ""Birdman"" but not one for acting. Fair enough.And as star-studded as it is, Anderson was wise enough to cast a relatively unknown young fellow (Tony Rivelori) for the central role of awkward lobby boy Zero (his old counterpart is played by F. Murray Abraham), Zero doesn't have any physical appeal, he's not even competent, but he's totally devoted to his Master Gustav and that is the key to their relationship, he's his eyes and ears during his absence in prison and together, they lead a heart-pounding adventure with the dawn of the War as a backdrop. Their relationship, which is one of the mentor and master can be very inspiring at time, even poignant, so maybe there are a few things to appreciate beyond the zaniness, after all.But apart from that, it's a film that can be tasted like a treat and full of tricks whose only purpose is to make you laugh, the whole thing wrapped up in a sumptuous visual package à la Anderson, a cinematic Mendl. ""The Grand Budapest"" is all about intellectual detachment, visual entertainment, and fun, fun and fun, tricks and treats, really."
" Stylishly Unique and Strangely Compelling: Wes Anderson at his Best
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,9,"To use the word ""quirky"" to describe a Wes Anderson film is like using the word ""wet"" to describe water, ""hot"" to describe fire, or ""horrible"" to describe Adam Sandler's film Jack and Jill. That being said, The Grand Budapest Hotel takes that very recognizable element of Wes Anderson's well-established style and embodies it in the most thoroughly enjoyable way yet. I would go as far as to say that this is his masterpiece. It has a fast-paced, humorous, and stylish cleverness to it that pervades nearly every setting, character, costume, and piece of dialogue contained within it.The entire aesthetic of the film, particularly the hotel itself, is so vivid and energetic so as to border on surreal, while being so uniquely stylized as to be completely distinct from anything else you've ever seen. The music for the film is also a tonally perfect match, being equal parts mysterious and playful. All of this brilliantly complements the revered, nearly mythical status of the strangely compelling lead character, eccentric hotel concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), who carries the film on his shoulders with great enthusiasm with his loyal lobby boy at his side.The film's universe and characters also have a distinctly ""out of place, out of time"" feeling to them. They feel just realistic enough to not be complete fantasy, but so fantastical so as to not feel real. The actual mechanics of the plot are compelling in their silly simplicity, revolving around a valuable painting known as ""Boy with Apple,"" yet the adventure that surrounds escalates into fantastically amusing absurdity. Even the villains are filled out in such a way so as to function as effective, intimidating villains yet still be surprisingly funny and almost cartoonishly nefarious. There is also a looming, somewhat nonspecific war on the brink of breaking out in this fantasy world (reminiscent of World War II era Europe), that threatens to tear it apart. Additionally, the way the story is set up is such that we know in the beginning that the glory days of this great hotel and its legendary concierge will, with time, come to an end. These elements add hints of melancholy and longing for a bygone era, which gives the film a bit more punch and substance than it might otherwise have.At its core, it's funny, fast-paced, witty, and weird, yet surprisingly simple and enjoyable. It will almost certainly win you over if you're interested in seeing something that isn't too heavy or serious, but still satisfying and full of substance. My only really complaint is that occasionally the Wes Anderson signature ""quirky"" style shines through so strongly in some of the more comedic scenes as to be cringe-inducing, but this is merely a matter of personal comedic taste. That being said, I think this movie maintains a wide appeal, even amongst individuals that haven't been a fan of Wes Anderson in the past. After all, this is probably his most universally liked film, having a unique and imaginative aesthetic and a fantastic leading performance."
" A work of art!
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,9,"Just wonderful movie, starting with a Very peculiar story the way it was recorded, it seems a sunset In a risky scene. The locations, the changing rooms, the decoration, everything It is very beautiful in this production. All details are very good CareRecommended to be seen!"
" Quirky comedy that outlives its welcome
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,5,"THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is another quirky comedy from director Wes Anderson, a man who can seemingly make no other type of movie. I watched and enjoyed the first half an hour of this film, finding it fresh and inventive; however, the magic began to wear off after this point, and by the end I found it more than a little tiresome. I have a feeling that the director's style would best be suited to short films, not overlong efforts like this.The problem with the film is that it has no meaning, no depth. What you see up on the screen is everything you'll get. The plot is simplistic, and devoid of much interest; Anderson keeps you watching only by including endless random cameos from all of his celebrity friends and actors. I've never been a fan of Ralph Fiennes and he can't shake off his coldness here, although the young cast members fare better. Some of the stars, like Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum, are great but get too little screen time. The movie raises a few smiles and has some nicely dark moments, but I was left wanting more from it and I found the whole experience oddly hollow."
" Wes Anderson being Wes Anderson
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,9,"The iconic hyperbolic nature of Wes Anderson's movies are seen here in the 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' in all its grandeur. What makes the movie standout is the complex nature of the story and the story telling methods which has been stitched into the fabric of a Wes Anderson movie seamlessly with the help of a robust script penned by Anderson himself. While the script allows itself to discuss complex relations and emotions, the actors shine in their respective roles with Ralph Fiennes and Tony Revolori giving flawless performances.Anyone who is familiar with Wes Anderson movies will know that the technical aspects of his movies are instrumental to his unique style of film making. This movie is no different. With brilliant cinematography, costume and production design, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a visual treat.The movie did fail me in one regard though. The story, while it is interesting, did not conclude its tale in the fashion it started in. Personally, I found it off-putting. But nonetheless, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a product of Wes Anderson's mastery in his style along with some brilliant performances."
" Masterpiece of Graphic Art
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie with many layers.Watch it for the story, the scenery, the direction, and the action, THEN watch it for the fantastic graphic work, a tour de force of signage, props, paper ephemera, even the carpeting, are all masterworks of design. Adam Stockhausen and his lead graphic designer, Annie Atkins, did fantastic work, this film will be shown as an example to film designers for years to come."
" Escapism perfected
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,10,"It's a bit like... going into an antique shop full of toys from your youth. They are toys, by definition, but they no longer represent toys - kids of today would barely know what to do with them. What they DO represent is nostalgia with a whiff of escapism. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a box of chocolates with grown up flavours. It allows the discerning viewer full access to the world of fantasy and escapism. Wes Anderson does such a stellar job; one almost gets the impression that the film is an, all but forgotten, favourite from the past. It, arguably, verges on blasphemy to make any comparison. Having said that; if Tim Burton and Roy Andersson skilfully were blended together - they may be venturing into Wes Andersson's territory.The Grand Budapest Hotel is, to a great extent, what good film making is about. In the world of film - it is also one of few ""musts"" on the shortlist."
" A visually masterful non-sense
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,3,"I feel sorry for the operators and all the other technicians that were recruited to produce this visually excellent picture about nothing. The script is so empty and devoid of any sense whatsoever that it made me question the emptiness I constantly feel inside my own life, and convince me that my life is actually full of wonder and magic compared to the dullness of this film's script. Wes Anderson must have indeed been on drugs. This movie is pure trash."
" Best film I have ever seen
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,10,"Ralph Fiennes steals the show as Gustave , who never despairs, even in the most unfavourable circumstances. But the real star is, of course, Wes Anderson. He is a Genius. In my opinion the most fabulous of all writer/directors past and present. I want to give him 1000 Oscars for every film he's ever made. Can't wait for the next one."
" A Magnum Opus for its Director and Grand Fun
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,10,"When this Wes Anderson film debuted in 2014, I was only vaguely familiar with the eccentric filmmaker that is Wes Anderson and was curious at this new release. After the movie was available to rent, I immediately went to the library and got my rental. Not knowing what to expect I was braced to may be not like the movie (I had only seen ""The Royal Tennebaums"" at the time), but was laughing myself silly within ten to twenty minutes of the run-time. Wes Anderson managed to blend elements of drama and comedy into the prefect recipe for fun in this delightful romp throughout the film.The film's premise is quite simple: an accomplished writer recounts his trip to the film's titular hotel back in his youth and is subsequently told the tale of how the hotel's current owner came to acquire the hotel. Interspersed with flashbacks we are thrown to a comedic and suspenseful narrative of wrongful accusations of murder, a stolen painting, prison escape, chases and a touching bond between opposite personalities.As expected, director Wes Anderson collects a vast array of colorful actors and actresses to portray the delightfully oddball players of his cinematic world. Outside of normal collaborators in minor roles, the film is bolstered by the dynamically offbeat performance of Ralph Fiennes as the bizarrely eccentric Monsieur Gustav H, the owner of the Grand Budapest in the 1932 flashbacks. Fiennes does bring his usual stoicism to the role, but in a hilarious twist piles on a dignified yet humorously profane comedic persona that is beyond enchanting. There's no shortage of quotable dialogue from M. Gustav as he delivers eloquent poetry, spouts scathing quips or has his off-putting bouts of inserting profanity into his monologues.Aiding Fiennes' wacky concierge is the naive yet eternally loyal Zero, played to near perfection by newcomer Tony Revolori. Revolori brings a youthful zazz to the character as Zero must quickly learn to adapt to his surroundings and the situations he is placed in, but there is even a world weariness to the young man as we later learn of his difficult past prior to arriving in Zubrowka Province at the start of WWII. The chemistry between Fiennes as Gustav and Revolori is so touching as the men become almost like a father and son by the story's end; ""We're brothers"" as Zero states after helping Gustav escape prison and reminding the bewildered concierge why he (Zero) has remained a faithful employee and friend. Bonus to director Anderson for casting Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham as the elder Zero in the 1968 time-line; bringing the wisdom needed to tell the writer the story with gravitas.The film boasts a stellar supporting cast in players like Saoirse Ronan as pastry chef and Zero's loyal and brave girlfriend, Agatha, Tilda Swinton as elderly wealthy widow Madame D (sadly we get little time to see Swinton deliver the goods in her performance but she leaves her mark), Jeff Goldblum as ill-fated lawyer Deputy Vilmos Kovacs, Edward Norton as a Nazi-inspired officer who really isn't a horrible guy but only doing his job, and as the film's memorable baddies are Adrien Brody as Madame D's scheming son, Dmitri, and as his muscle is a mostly silent Willem Dafoe as the sinister, sadistic psychopathic Jopling. It's up to the latter two actors to be as villainous as needed without delving into caricatures which both actors do with finesse. Dafoe in particular delivers the chills as he looms in the shadows and menaces unsuspecting targets with little dialogue, somber glares and violent tactics to accomplish means to an end. This is used to perfect effect during the museum chase when Jeff Goldblum's Kovacs tries to elude Dafoe's Jopling; Anderson utilizes the isolation of each exhibit room, sound of footsteps and shadows to build the tension in the scene until the shocking outcome (hint: it doesn't end well for one of them).Director Wes Anderson decides to use a bright color palette for the setting of ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" to bring out the whimsy and comedic tones. We are presented with light shades of purple, white snow and various light and bright shades of pink particularly the pink exterior of the film's titular building and then we see the reds, purples and golds of the interior to bring the world to life. There are few dark colors like grays, black and dark blue hues for the villains, the internment camp, the Nazi-style uniforms of the soldiers and the pre-dawn sky.A visual treat, excellent acting and a delightful story that will appeal to any Wes Anderson fan."
" ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" Movie Review
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,8,"Before watching ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", I have never seen a movie that combined a love story, ridiculous moments, dark humor, and colorful characters, especially shown in breathtakingly beautiful scenes. Although there is so much to love, I personally think the characters, the cinematography, and the dynamic story are what make it Wes Anderson's best film. From young Zero, all the way to Gustave's fellow inmates in prison, the characters each have a unique flair about them. And of course, if you are familiar with Anderson's work, he has filled this movie to brim with visual beauty. I feel like I'm walking through a painting each time I watch it. Also, Anderson managed to incorporate so much different themes, details, and several story lines that develop within.Whether he is the character you root for, or the evil one, each of the characters have been made exceptionally. The young hero of our story is Zero. He is the teenaged assistant to the concierge: Gustave. Zero is the small, skinny Indian teen who does exactly as he is told. While Gustave is the boss of the Hotel, keeping it in tip-top shape, taking care of any guest's needs. The movie ultimately revolves around these two and we are able to learn about the deep hidden secrets and mysteries of Gustave. Gustave's intelligent ""posh"" British humor was outrageously funny. As the audience, we get to see how Zero learns the ins and outs of running a hotel and learning more about people and life through his adventures. And in broad terms, the details of each character's outfit is what truly wowed me. Each time that I have watched this movie, I have noticed a new small detail in someone's costume that shows just a tad more about their identity. Thus, the Oscar for Best Achievement in Costume Design fortifies the importance of appearance. The attention to detail and the range of characters and what the audience can see about them adds to the greatness.Even the non artistic viewer can appreciate the undeniable beauty in each scene. In fact, I think it is Anderson's best work because it is the most ""Wes Anderson-y"". His distinct framing and screenplay is very unique and out of the box for most movies in modern cinema. If you are familiar with his style, you could watch any moment of GBH and know instantly that it's an Anderson flick. But, his individuality and homage to film during the 1930s, roughly the setting of the movie, is what makes the viewer feel a more authentic experience. Anderson plays with different aspect ratios that were most commonly used for the specific decade in which the story is taking place. This is a brilliant touch, and rare in Hollywood movies today. Also, his use of bright, saturated colors and arranging them to complement and contrast are aesthetically pleasing to the viewer. The reoccurring light and happy colors contrast and emphasize the dark themes in the story. What I like the most about the screenplay and cinematography is the symmetry. The way that a majority of the scenes incorporate shapes and all the design elements to work for each other is truly masterful. Personally, my favorite scene is when there is a chain of concierges from different hotels calling each other in order to aid Gustave. The simplicity of shapes and using different colors is pleasing to watch, and really shows off Anderson's art.The plot of the film was the meatiest of the Anderson movies that I have seen, with lots of different conflicts and excitement. The main story of the movie is Gustave running the hotel between the World Wars in Europe along with the chase for a priceless renaissance painting. Although the action and plot is great to watch unravel, the small themes and little side stories really impress me. We see the coming of age story in Zero. As we watch him learn through experiences that teach him how to run a hotel and eventually become the owner of the GBH. And we see the different ideas of love, coming from young Zero experiencing love for most likely his first time, and eventually marrying the girl despite their young age and short time together. On the other hand, there is Gustave's love life, where he is romantic with many of the old wealthy widowed women who stay in the hotel occasionally, mainly for his love. Perhaps, Anderson is saying about love and relationships with the different types shown in this movie. It could be the spontaneous and brash decision making that you can make when you fall for someone in an instant. Or, possibly the slow, methodical, elderly prize driven lust that some may crave. It's truly up to the individual to decide.Personally, the main reason I fell in love with ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" was for the cinematography and art within, but I couldn't help but enjoy seeing the characters and watching the story. I liked that with all the humor, darkness, and other factors, there was still a lot to think about after watching the film as well. I hope everyone can carve out an hour and half sometime to watch my favorite movie, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel."""
" Amazing film
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"Well, there is not much left to say after seeing this amazing picture but that i regret not to have seen it earlier. The way this story is brought to the viewer is in my opinion, brilliant. The fact as it is not presented to you in a deeply realistic way, i by this i mean that this movie has a very marked caricature way in its characterization, image, speeches and even narrative. Gives you the constant same feeling you get of you reading a book, as you imagine the scenes, the places, the light everything. And i think that shows what a great job the Wes Anderson did giving you this brilliant film. With nothing else to say i advise everyone to see this movie."
" A film with nostalgic vibes
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"The Grand Budapest Hotel. I didn't know what I would expect when I saw the trailer for the first time. Wes Anderson, the director of this movie, has done such a brilliant job creating this masterpiece. Every scene seemed to be perfect and well-thought according to my aspect, Robert Yeoman (cinematographer) is very clever for creating scenes with aesthetically pleasing colors and angles to attract the person watching, the vibe of the movie is what made me most excited to watch it. The plot is fun, exciting, and funny. Not a movie that you'd find yourself yawning half-way. Zero (Tony Revolori) is the new lobby boy that finds himself on an unusual adventure with M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) his manager."
