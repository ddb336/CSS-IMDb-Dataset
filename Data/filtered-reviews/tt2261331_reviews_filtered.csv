" Ok.
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,6,"Alright, pretty predictable when it comes to building the plot. Overall alright movie, could have ended better."
" Great acting all around, and taut, well made
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,9,"Super script and acting, very entertaining. Real narrative power, and for submarine buffs, a treat!6.4 is just way too low a rating, deserves at least a 7.0! Giving it a 9 to bump it up a teeny tiny bit ;-)"
" Don't create sparks near fuel
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,4,"Starts out promising. Then the gimmicks to propel tension get stupid. To wit:Open barrels of fuel near sparks.
A killer who roams freely.
A hull breach that ""sends 'em to the bottom.All lazy writing and a wasted opportunity."
" Da gold!!
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,6,"Jude Law is on his A game here along with the always brilliant Ben Mendelsohn. They carry the movie, the whole film revolves around lost WW 2 Gold. I like the premise but it is a little silly at times and missed just slightly on being a really good movie. Still was worth a watch tho."
" Reminds Me a Lot of Kelly's Heroes.....
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,8,Good Movie about Lost Nazi Gold under the water trapped in a submarine. Very enjoyable. 8/10
" Great submarine flick.
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,8,"I love Submarine movies. Das Boot, Red October etc are super films. This is up there with them. Not the same level of casting or cinematography but really well made and well acted. Jude Law is fantastic, although the Scottish accent wasn't necessary. Great action and believable scenarios. You are rooting for the crew until the end - except for Scoot McNairy."
" Decisions make no sense
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,4,Terrible movie....literally let the guy whose murdering everyone lose and side with him only to get themselves killed....trash
" Dangerous Crew
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,7,"After working for many years for the marine salvage company Agora, the submarine captain Robinson (Jude Law) is fired in a downsizing without pension plan or any reward. While drinking in a bar with his friends Blackie (Konstantin Khabenskiy) and Kurston (Daniel Ryan), who were also fired, the depressed Kurston discloses that he knows the location of a World War II U-Boat loaded with gold that sank in the coast of Georgia. Robinson and Blackie meet a man called Lewis (Tobias Menzies) that agrees to be the sponsor of a salvage expedition of the treasure; in return, he charges 40% of the gold and demands his friend Lewis (Tobias Menzies) goes with them. When Robinson seeks out Kurston, he learns from the young Tobin (Bobby Schofield) that his friend committed suicide. He decides to invite Tobin to replace Kursten in the half-British half-Russian crew he has team-up. Along their journey, there is constant friction between the men jeopardizing the operation. Will Robinson be capable to control the dangerous crew?""Black Sea"" is a tense and claustrophobic thriller with good story and great performances, highlighting Jude Law. Most of the scenes are breathtaking and the conclusion perfect to the plot. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Mar Negro"" (""Black Sea"")"
" Great idea, not very well executed.
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,6,"Ex submarine divers go looking for Nazi treasure.Sounds like a great idea, and for the most part it works.
Acting is fairly good.
Story is OK however think it could have been better with a longer run time.
Characters are fairly undeveloped and you will struggle to care for them.
Unfortunately some of the suspense is ruined when the film trys to pull of these unrealistic scenarios which just make you cringe.Is it worth a watch.. sure!"
" Great action movie, great cast!!
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,7,"I read someones review and it's funny how people think movies have to be so accurate about things like drive shafts, compatibility, technical garbage it's a fricking movie you moron!! Its NOT real, sorry but they're are no aliens, there's no god, the bible is a story, there are no ghosts, wrestling isn't real, trump isn't a human, it's a movie its SUPPOSE to be just 1 thing ENTERTAINING and this movie was!!!! Also jude law was phenomenal!!"
" The scriptwriter needed a bad ending
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,3,"WARNING: PLOT SPOILERS
Agree with other reviews so far as the atmosphere and suspense (both terrific). The acting is excellent and the script first rate most of the time: people speak lucidly and coherently except in a couple of major instances. The trouble I had with this movie is the script/plot. For the first half, the story moves logically and tension is built up nicely. Then the ""psychopath"" (if you knew he is a psychopath, why would you hire him?) gets upset and murders a crew member. This same psycho was motivated by greed (why should everyone get the same share?); in the second half, he thinks the gold is affecting the captain's judgement and wants to surrender it to the Georgians. You can't have it both ways! Then out of nowhere, there is an electrical fault that disables the sub. End of story. By this stage, you realise you have been well and truly sucked in by the scriptwriter into believing that a happy outcome is possible. To top it all, the captain mysteriously inflates a rescue suit loaded with gold! Credibility is shattered by then so anything goes. I gave this movie 3/10 instead of 4/10 in the hope that it deters the undecideds from watching it."
" Submarine Action
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,7,"Haven't remembered seeing Jude Law since Ai where he played a strange synthetic. This time as a washed up sub captain I'll be remembering him again because he was excellent.
Basically Robinsin (Law) is given an opportunity to salvage some gold with a make do team on an old Russian sub. Not technically brilliant but some tense underwater action, personality clashes, bit of humor and interesting till the end.
Well worth the watch for action/sub fans."
" LAZY WRITING for people who have an IQ.
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,3,"The writers did not want to do any work, so they install plot devices that were elementary-level dumb.Examples
1. Bringing an 18 year old who is so dumb he thinks there is a chimney on the submarine(I am not making this up).
2. Bringing an accountant who is claustrophobic for reasons to propel the story(why do we need an accountant on a sub?)
3. Bringing a psychotic, knowing he is a psychotic for no other reason then to propel the story. It would be different if he had a specific needed skill, but he did not.
4. Having the 18 year kid(who doesn't speak Russian) work with the Russian fixing the sub instead of having one of the other 6 Russians so we can have issues with language that damages the sub.
5. Having the psychotic, AFTER HE KILLS SOMEONE and everyone knows what he did, walk around like nothing happen as he just broke a lamp, just so he could do something else to mess with the mission The protagonist(Jude Law) didn't even tell the psychotic that he was even in the wrong, just gave him a grimaced look. That scene alone just sank the movie.
6. Almost forgot, using a 70-year old sub before checking it out first to see if everything is working.Sad, because story and Jude Law had so much potential Das Boots or U-571 was able to create the tension and drama without artificalliy creating the drama with completely stupid devices."
" ASTONISHING!... and not in the good way.
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,1,"Beyond criminal... I'd be surprised if Kevin Macdonald doesn't spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for this turkey.Save yourselves. If you watch this, it's two hours you'll never get back, and you'll curse yourself for not listening to me.BELIEVE the bad reviews. You've been warned."
" Another Solid, Gloomy and Tense Submarine Film
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)The need for submarine pilots has tanked. The jobless pilots are looking for work and money. A group of men, privately funded, hatch a plan to find sunken gold buried in a submarine. The team resurrects a...um...historic submarine for the task. A well-oiled machine this is not; neither are there crew. Strife between the men put the mission in jeopardy. Will they rise to the challenge with the gold and their lives? This was pretty entertaining and had reasonable character development, acting and plausible enough story to care what happens. Dig deep and you can spot plot holes."
" Whilst watching this film i thought i could be watching?
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,5,Das boot or The Hunt for Red October both better movies
" Jude Law proves he can act again.
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,9,"When, I saw Jude Law in Gattaca, I was stunned. He was so good in that film, I could not wait for his next movie. But every movie since then, he has not acted he has been Jude Law.With this film, he again shows he can act when he wants to. The whole movie has a great cast, but Jude Law stood out and to me at least proved he could act again. Watch this its well worth it and is gritty and real.Shaun Wallace"
" SEA THIS MOVIE
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,8,"It is worth watching and let it entertain you by resisting the temptation to critique and instead give-in and enjoy a mature, seasoned Jude Law as we dive into this movie. It reveals itself early on and then at some point you wonder about human nature as the characters aboard act out dysfunction against the opportunity to make millions. Will they or wont they succeed? At times you may find yourself holding your breath which for a submarine movie is expected. Enjoy the developing plot, suspense, problems, solutions and twists as we hope and wait to see if this sub will surface. What's at stake? More money than you can spend for the rest of your life. The risks? Your life! Would you gamble it all or some or none? While you are contemplating what you would do watch what they do. That's the movie plain and simple. Good snack movie plus a tasty drink adds to the pleasure"
" Voyage To The Bottom Of The Barrel, or 20,000 Leagues Sub Standard. Abysmal.
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,1,"Jude Law's Scottish accent is worse than Sean Connery's Russian one, and that's the least bad thing about this heap of unpardonable dreck.A bunch of unemployed (Jude Law gets Das Boot from his submarine-driving job) middle-aged English and Russians who ought to know better decide to make a submarine film for the Twentynoughteens, in the hope of retrieving - yes, you guessed it - Nazi gold. They fail, miserably. Not even spectacularly. The end.Every single submarine cliché known to man. Ice Station Zebra was avant-garde compared to this. You know how they say when you're drowning, your life flashes before you? When you get to this movie you'll want to fast-forward.You know you're watching a complete and utter load of puerile, putrescent tripe when the three crack deep-sea divers down at 95 metres -
that's the old one with emphysema, the 17-year-old who's done a bit of SCUBA and the psychopathic one who completely predictably caused all the problems (otherwise there'd be no, y'know, drama) but still gets to lead the dive team -know they've discovered the U-Boat with the gold because they brush off a bit of silt and there's a huge swastika visible. No disrespect to stupid people, but that's insulting to the intelligence of stupid people, let alone U-Boat experts. (Presumably there were no U-Boat experts available for technical advice, or they all went off gold-hunting in pre-production).More holes in the plot than the rusty old Russian sub itself. Do you know how bad this movie is? Not even Michael Caine was in a film this bad, that's how bad."
" Anarchy in a sub
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,7,"This movie is actually pretty good, the acting was believable and the cinematography was well done. The premise gave good backstory and for the most part flowed nicely. Then about 3/4 into the movie and the crew collapses and pitches the movie into complete anarchy. The crew members are backstabbing, have shifting priorities and switch sides every minute. The ending is actually quite sad. Plot is a bit of a stretch and not entirely believable on all points."
" A B movie starring Jude Law
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,5,"Just an ok movie. Really, a B rate movie in the truest sense. Let Jude Law star in it to get people watching, otherwise it was average at best."
" Thin
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,4,"As many reviews previously stated, Black Sea is not believable. Most of the plot points are phoned in right from the start, the writer doesn't even try to make you believe them. Therefore watching it is not that compelling. The ending is supposed to be emotional, but suffers from the same lack of drama. Overall, Black Sea grants 2 hours of mindless entertainment."
" Exceptional Jude Law Submarine/Gold/Disaster Suspense Movie - Loved It
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,8,04/17/2019 This is an excellent suspense movie. Well laid out storyline played out by professional actors. Do not pass it by. Bon Appetit
" A technical nightmare
",2019-03-19 00:00:00,1,Any person with minimal technical knowledge will have nightmares after watching this aberration. Avoid at all costs.
" Pretty Good!
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,8,"Ignore of some the bad reviews, just saw this for the first time and really enjoyed it. Too many people looking for perfection in a movie, no it is not fast paced action but does you keep you into the story. Stop looking for perfect and just enjoy!"
" Technical issues galore!!!
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,3,"Why is it so hard for various producers to create storylines that even remotely pass muster of believability?Sure, we'll just hop in a ""vintage"" Soviet submarine, that's been sitting around for however many decades, and off we go! No fuel polishing, taking on fresh fuel, servicing systems, batteries, etc- nope we're just going to grab some food and go!How many times can we crash said vintage submarine and it not suffer structural damage/ implode?Escaping in an ""escape suit"" (which looks like a red Tyvek painter's suit) from ~300 meters depth? Sure, why not! (the pressure from equalizing the tubes would kill you in 2 seconds)""Sonar"" with no pings but a dude can create a 3D map of the surrounding area via banging on the hull?Speaking of sonar, if anyone thinks it's possible to just slither around underwater in a submarine without various Navies realizing that you're there, it just doesn't work that way.My absolute favorite though, is the ""driveshaft"" mumbo jumbo. First of all, ships/ submarines don't have ""driveshafts,"" they have ""propeller shafts."" I used the plural of the word ""shaft"" since the Russians have favored twin screw designs for their subs, and all of the exterior scenes in the movie show a twin screw vessel.Diesel/ electric subs are exactly that. The diesels (again, more than one) turn generators which produce power to charge the batteries. The screws are turned by DC electric motors. They can either run continuously while surfaced, or within periscope depth (where the snorkel allows for engine and cabin air exchange and also hydrogen gas venting from battery charging). When submerged deeper than this, they secure the diesel engines, and everything draws off the batteries (including the propulsion motors). The norm was to run surfaced at night to charge the batteries, and submerged during the day. During combat, they could conserve power and remain submerged for, at most, a few days.Back to the ""driveshaft."" Steel shafts don't ""shatter"" during a fire (especially ones there are 5"" - 8"" thick, which is what they'd be). What's far more comical to anyone who knows anything about mechanical things, is that what's pictured is a crankshaft from a car sized engine. The auxiliary generator engines on a vessel like that have a crankshaft that weighs over 1000 pounds. The main diesel engine cranks weigh several thousand pounds.A propshaft for a vessel the size of a submarine is also several thousand pounds.Even if we ignore the nomenclature, and substitute ""prop shaft"" for ""driveshaft,"" there would be two of them (one for each screw). So, even if one ""shattered,"" they can limp along on a single screw.""Oh, we'll just machine it to make it fit."" Sorry, but you can't ""just machine"" a BMW crank and make it fit into a Honda motor!I seriously laughed out lout at the scene that shows the ""driveshaft"" spinning away with the throws (which are what the rods attach to in a piston engine) connected to nothing. Oh, the sparks flying were a nice touch too.I get that this isn't a documentary, but is it really THAT difficult to keep things remotely within reason?"
" Imbecilic
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,1,"If you know anything about physics, mechanics or diving don't watch this movie unless you just want a giggle. Among other idiocy the crew boards a U-Boat that's been on the bottom for 70 years and finds it full of air; water somehow doesn't get in when they enter it (!) then they take a crankshaft (which they call a ""driveshaft"") from the U-boat (Daimler-Benz diesel engines) and install it in their Russian submarine, to start the diesel engines while they are on the bottom (!) and drive away. Oh, and they do this breathing ""oxygen"" at a depth of 95 meters. All of this goes on while a crew of 9 operate a diesel-electric submarine submerged. There's even more stupidity than this; if you want to laugh at it watch the silly thing.
This is the stupidest submarine movie since U-571, which had WW2 era subs dueling with torpedoes while submerged.
The writers of this silly circus act didn't take even a casual look at the operation of submarines or diving before penning this silly script."
" Good story
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed (most of) this movie. I kind of expected the ending, but it had a certain ""grab you"" story. I really wish that English movies would cut back on the F-bombs. Unnecessary and distracting. You may say ""realism"", but I disagree."
" Intense
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,8,"This movie is action packed, the submarine scenes are truly realistic the dive action is great the acting is pretty good but really intense a really hold your breath movie with a great plot."
" The overall feeling is general
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,6,"The overall feeling is general. After 10 minutes, you will know that it is the traditional treasure hunting route. You can guess that you are going to die when you see the submarine and the team. It can only be said that in the face of enormous wealth, anyone will shed the greedy side of human nature."
" ""We live together or die together.""
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,8,"I don't know what it is about submarine movies but they generally offer a great deal of fascination to go with the claustrophobic feel of remaining in a confined space. I thought this was a good one despite the relatively low score here on IMDb. I had to chuckle a bit when Captain Robinson (Jude Law) made known his manpower requirements for the gold salvage mission - six Brits and six Russians. I'm just about in the middle of watching all the James Bond movies in order of release, and that sounded like a plot element from something like ""The Spy Who Loved Me"".But I'll tell you what. When I got my first glimpse of that rust bucket Robinson decided to take on his mission, I was pretty convinced right there I would never have gone along for the ride. That, along with the behavior of some of the crewmen, argued against the credibility of the picture. With the story line's insistence that the sub couldn't be operated with anything less than twelve men, each time someone like Fraser (Ben Mendelsohn) went off half cocked, he not only jeopardized the mission, but everyone's life including his own. Granted, he was described as a psychopath going in, and he lived up to that description, but it made for a less than satisfactory conclusion for most of the seamen.I don't know if it was a continuity error or not, but remember when Daniels (Scoot McNairy) told Robinson that the ship's financier Lewis (Tobias Menzies) wanted Daniels to go along on the mission. Later on under duress, Daniels admitted to Robinson that Lewis was actually an actor and that it was Robinson's former employer Agora that was staking the voyage and that Robinson would be arrested as soon as the sub surfaced with the recovered gold. The question mark is why then did Daniels board the sub, unless it was Agora that forced him as an employee to keep an eye on Robinson throughout the mission. One could assume that, but it was never clarified later in the story, and by that time, Daniels was hysterical about dying in an underwater death trap.So, no happy ending here for Robinson and most of his crew. I'm of mixed opinion on whether he should have ditched the mission or not. His odds of achieving a positive outcome kept lowering with each crewman's death, and even if his go for broke attitude resulted in personal failure, he was still gambling with the lives of all aboard. When all was lost, his only consolation was to accept his fate while sitting on a pile of gold, and as the grim reaper is fond of reminding one, you can't take it with you."
" So many factual errors
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,5,"This film had us until we saw footage of a crankshaft, more likely from a Holden than a U boat. Wherever it is from is immaterial as they are searching for a propellor shaft to repair their sub, not a crankshaft. Otherwise an entertaining flick. Good cast."
" ARE WE GOING TO DIE DOWN HERE?
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,8,"First the disclaimer. I am a sucker for a good submarine drama/thriller.Robinson (Jude Law) has been let go from his salvage company because they no longer use submarines and hence do not need submarine captains. He is soon given a salvage offer for gold that may exist on a submarine in the Black Sea. Its location is known, however the operation will be illegal, but the reward is high. They must use a Russian submarine, and thus the crew will be split, half Russian, half British. The drama begins right away. The crew includes a man who is claustrophobic, a near 18 year old newbie, and some psychos. The disagree over the food, sleeping arrangements, and share splitting. In fact the drama was a bit silly since the reward and short duration of the salvage far exceeded the need for bickering. Then there is a twist, a few improbable moments, and an ending that wasn't formula. Enjoyable, but then again I literally spent years on a sub.It is not ""Das Boot"" but it was in English.Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity."
" Good drama
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,4,Is not an Oscar Movie. But is good enough to watch at home. Good ending and a good message
" Wow...
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,3,Man what a stinker... I was once in your shoes... reading reviews about this movie and wether or not to watch it. I read all the reviews... some good ones and some bad ones. I gambled and went with the good ones. Crap I was wrong. Should have listened to all the bad reviews cause they were right on. It could have been so much better but man it was pretty bad. Listen to the bad reviews please and don't bother with this one. If you want to watch a good sub movie go with u571 or crimson tide... leave this one in the black abyss of stank ass! Peace!!!
" Best sub movie for a while
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,7,"The plot etc is covered well everywhere else so this is limited to my opinion:I liked it a lot. Law's accent is dodgy, technically there are a few issues and several things are implausible (e.g. taking a noob kid on a sub when apparently he knows loads of experienced guys, fiding the swastika on the 200 m long sunken U Boat etc). However, it felt realistic and gripping and the best thing about it was I had no idea where it was going.Nice job, delighted I watched it."
" Black Sea
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,6,"The title made it obvious it was some kind of dark movie, in the water, I knew the leading actor in it, and that critics gave it good reviews, so I was just hoping for something worthwhile, directed by Kevin Macdonald (Touching the Void, The Last King of Scotland). Basically veteran sea captain Robinson (Jude Law) has recently divorced from his wife and is estranged from his son, he then receives the news that he is being made redundant, given £8,640 for his services and told to clean his desk. Later Robinson has drinks with former colleagues, he meets his friend Kurston (Daniel Ryan) and a Russian called Blackie (Konstantin Khabensky), Kurston tells Robinson they have an idea that could make them all a lot of money. A German Type VIIC U-boat from World War II that sank off the coast of Georgia, with a cargo of gold worth millions, their former colleague found its location, but it was never salvaged. Robinson agrees with Kurston to meet a backer named Lewis (Casino Royale's Tobias Menzies), who agrees to fund Robinson's expedition, on the grounds he receives a 40% cut on proceeds worth up to $40 million, a 20% cut on anything above that, and that his executive Daniels (Scoot McNairy) accompany the expedition. Robinson agrees to the deal, but then a young man named Tobin (Bobby Schofield) informs him that Kurston has committed suicide, Robinson decides to bring Tobin on the expedition, acquiring a Foxtrot-class submarine from the Port of Sevastopol. The crew is 50% Russian and 50% British, there are issues between the two groups almost immediately, only Blackie speaks both Russian and English, and Tobin is viewed as a bad omen, mistaken as a virgin, when in fact he is an expectant father. Tension begins to mount between the two crews due to the close confines of the submarine, and Robinson makes the decision that the take will be divided equally between each crewman. Due to mounting pressures the crew fall out, there is a fight, and Fraser (Ben Mendelsohn) loses his head, stabbing and killing Blackie, the ensuing scuffle causes a fire to break out, the sub is damaged, Robinson is knocked unconscious and at least two men are killed. Eighteen hours later, Robinson wakes to find tensions at breaking point, the Russians have taken over half of the boat, with the British in the other half, and with Blackie dead there is no way to speak to the Russians. The sub's drive shaft is damaged, they discover they are close to the old U-boat, they may be able to transfer its drive shaft and save the boat, but tensions continue to mount when it discovered Morozov (Grigoriy Dobrygin) speaks English. Robinson sends Tobin with Fraser and diver Peters (David Threlfall) to recover the drive-shaft and the gold, but on their way back, Peter perishes when his air hose gets cut. With Morozov translating the crew manage to get the Russians to install the drive-shaft and get the submarine moving again, at this stage, Daniels admits that they have been set up to do the dangerous job, his employer will seize the gold as soon as they surface. Robinson decides to remain submerged and travel to Turkey, to keep the gold and avoid arrest, he also decides, against the wishes of the crew, to attempt a risky journey through a narrow channel. Meanwhile Daniels persuades Fraser to murder Zaytsev (Sergey Puskepalis), there are no longer enough men to safely operate the submarine, and a second fire and explosion sends the boat back to the seafloor, and it begins taking on water. Fraser and the remaining crew members try to repair the leaks, but their efforts are futile, before the men can escape, a panicked Daniels locks the bulkhead behind him, three men are left to drown, but he traps himself snagging his clothing. Morozov closes the final bulkhead, Daniels if left to drown, and he, Robinson and Tobin are protected in the torpedo section, there are three hidden escape suits hidden. Robinson evacuates Tobin and Morozov, he explains he will follow using an emergency lever, the two men surface, but Morozov informs Robin there was no lever, Robinson chose to sacrifice himself, it ends with the thirs suit surfacing with some gold and Robinson's family picture inside. Also starring Jodie Whittaker as Chrissy, Karl Davies as Liam, Michael Smiley as Reynolds, Sergey Veksler as Baba and Sergey Kolesnikov as Levchenko. Law sports a strong Scottish accent and is good as the captain struggling to maintain control, the other cat members are fine as well, it is a simple enough story, westerners versus the Russians undersea, mixed with a desperate struggle to survive, and a treasure hunt, there is a fair amount of disaster to keep a pace going, overall it is a watchable thriller. Good!"
" Submarine epic for the common man **NO SPOILERS**
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,9,"This really is the kind of theme that can justify an excellent movie, If done right.Black Sea really is done right.If Crimson Tide is the officers submarine film, this is one for the guys slopping the grease.It's a tale of the down trodden trying a last attempt at fighting back against ""the man"". It's the Miners Strike of '84. It's a workforce made redundant trying to fight the power.The camera work is down low at parts almost as if the cast are being filmed by a peeping tom. As the pressure cranks up the lights are predominantly neon blues and reds aboard the sub. The atmosphere achieved is almost alien.Gold is the aim. And gold is surely achieved in this supreme film. Pretty much faultless.A buoyant 9 out of 10 for me"
" A disaster with plot holes deeper than the title
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,1,"I'm an avid submarine fan and love these kind of movies, but though also a fan of some of the actors, this is a movie to avoid at all costs. I was baffled to see a 6.4 average for this on IMDb. It contains so many plot holes, not just for a person familiar with the operation of underwater vessels and diving (just 1 example: how about sonar pings from a 50's sub making no sounds?), but will most likely be unbearable to anyone because of this. Whole segments are just as if they were left out, and the whole concept was down right stupid on top of that, and the reasoning among the characters is amazingly weird, and not in a good way. I will not go into any more details, not to spoil it for those still wanting to waste almost 2 hours of a Saturday night as I did, but heed my advice - avoid it."
" Fairly unique and well-portrayed depiction of a search for submarine riches
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,9,"Kevin Macdonald is the British Director who gave us ""The Last King of Scotland"" and ""State of Play"", so we have every reason to expect another worthwhile job with ""Black Sea"", even if we may start off by asking serious questions about the value or worth of a (""let's take out an old Russian sub to recover Nazi gold from an old German sub on the bed of the Black Sea"") movie that is remote, not only from our experience in the audience, but also from the experience of pretty much everybody else on the planet.But Macdonald of course shows his class here, as this is not merely a (very) well-done submariner film (with all the claustrophobia and clumsiness and danger that that denotes), but is also a piece about how unity and disunity, loyalty and treachery fight it out in a group of professionally-trained men, pretty much down on their luck but suddenly given one very, very big chance in life. Just how ruthless are they prepared to be, most especially in those moments when ""the job"" doesn't come first and they have time to reflect and see the big picture? And beyond even that, the very big ""big picture"" is one in which these men have risked their lives, been supremely professional, in order to serve and enrich others less skilled, less daring than they are, but in the fortunate position of being able to pull the strings, rather than hang from them, puppet-like. While most of these former sailors and divers are left on life's scrapheap, they have certainly gone on contributing to the wealth and power of others. Somehow, this Gini coefficient-based truth about the world would strike a powerful chord in countless viewers of this film. The problem is best embodied here by a quite non-Jude Law-like Jude Law as ""Robinson"", but in fact all the characters present exemplify this same message well. Here are people ready to risk everything in order to finally get ""ahead of the game"".Of course, it is another world of down there that is being portrayed, and we do get a good hint of that, authentic enough given the extensive expert assistance listed in the film credits. It's tense, but also well-observed stuff, and there's plenty to keep us interested for the 1 hour 50 minutes the film extends over."
" Possession obsession
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,8,"Jude Law stars with Karl Davies and Daniel Ryan in ""Black Sea"" from 2014, directed by Kevin MacDonald and written by Dennis Kelly.Robinson (Law), does ocean salvage but is fired by his company. A friend, Kurston (Ryan) tells him about a Nazi sub that went down in the Black Sea that was carrying millions in Russian gold.The two find a backer who will take 40 percent. Robinson wants six Brits and six Russians for his crew. The backer wants Daniels, his banker (Scoot McNairy), to go along too. The end result is a bunch of low-lifes with different ideas about the gold and the trip.The sub is old with lots of problems. That, accompanied with the attitude of crew members makes for big headaches. While trying to salvage a driver from another downed sub, Daniels gives Robinson some devastating news and tells him to abort the operation. However, no matter what happens, Robinson insists that they continue.Suspenseful and claustrophobic film with a biting performance by Jude Law as the determined Robinson. Law has been a smooth leading man, a character actor (Road to Perdition), and now a tough character lead. He is very effective. The rest of the performances are very good, including Karl Davies as a near-eighteen-year-old who has a child on the way. Scoot McNairy, Daniel Ryan, Ben Mendelsohn, and Konstantin Khabenskiy give great support.I think the IMDb score is low. This film made me nervous and held my interest, and I loved the ending. To me those are indications that this film deserved more than 6.4."
" Should have been Torpedoed as soon as the script was released.
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,4,"*Spoilers*Submarine movies have the natural ingredients to become classics and I was hoping this could live up to it's predecessors success. I was wrong. It starts with a double take at Jude Law's Scottish accent and progresses slowly with a hint of promise as the adventure begins. The promise slowly builds as the film initially takes shape but swiftly sinks after being torpedoed by the characters and storytelling. I was forced to turn it off once the only English-speaking Russian crew member is stabbed in what seemed like a scene from a performing arts GCSE class. The characters are unbelievable and the fact that some Australian psycho starts causing trouble over absolutely nothing just killed it. Some custard-cream munching soft-lad from Liverpool finds himself on the boat and is entrusted with helping fix the diesel engine - duly causes a mass fire, explosion and they're doomed. Jude Law smashed the only radio on board with an Axe because one crew member has checked his lottery numbers - really? Oh and some bloke commits suicide after hatching the plan to salvage all the Nazi gold - sure he does! Don't bother watching this trash and watch Red October on repeat.Das Boot this in the bin."
