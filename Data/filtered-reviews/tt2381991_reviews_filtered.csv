" I liked it
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,8,"The new version of the old story.
But kids don't have to watch this"
" Usually, it honors its predecessor... but not always.
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,7,"The fate of most successful films is to have sequels that are reasonably more depressing than the first film. So it was with ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". The film was a relatively remarkable success and the production of this film, a hybrid of a prequel and a sequel, was expected.The story centers on Queen Ravenna's sister, who instituted a reign of ice, fear and insensitivity in a territory North of the kingdom that Ravenna controlled. The story reminded me a lot of the Snow Queen, by Hans Christian Andersen. In this film, the possession of the old Ravenna's mirror is the key of the plot, after a group of soldiers who carried the accursed object had massacred each other for no reason. On the one hand, we have a group of dwarves and the Huntsman, willing to escort the mirror to safety; on the other hand, we have Freya's forces committed to steal it. The personal story of the Huntsman, who we discover to have been a member of a kind of Freya's ""elite troop"", and his romance with Sarah, are also important plot elements.The film is good and entertaining, but it is far from perfect. The story told has a lot of flaws in logic and continuity. The film was able to create an interesting new villain, but Freya was never as effective and threatening as Ravenna, and is a little melodramatic. We may feel sorry for her, but we are almost never afraid of her. On the other hand, there are several moments where things become too unusual. This is the case with the Goblins sequence which, despite being one of the best action moments in the film, seemed too extravagant. There are some people who criticized this film because Snow White is basically a brown eminence who never appears. Personally, given that, in the first film, Kristen Stewart was horrible, it doesn't even seem like a bad idea to do that.The cast has strong and well-known names. Chris Hemsworth returned to the role of the Huntsman and is totally at ease, doing a good and convincing job. The same can be said of Jessica Chastain. She looks great. I would say that both of them really liked their characters and had a good time working because not only did they seem to have fun, but they also created a convincing chemistry. The villain was played by Emily Blunt, who was sinister and insensitive as Freya. Nick Frost, Alexandra Roach, Sheridan Smith and Rob Brydon are funny and season with humor and pleasant doses of action four characters very necessary to the plot. But their exaggerated comic streak can take away some credibility. Charlize Theron also reappears as Ravenna, closer to the end, and she is good at what she does but has little to do.Directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, the film has a fast pace and things happen quite intensely from the middle on, with more and more action and a great ending. He knew how to explore the visual and stylistic aspects of the film very well, but is less happy with the development of the characters. The costumes, in particular those for the female cast, were very well-thought-out and have a strong visual appeal. The film makes great use of the potential of CGI and computer graphics, acquiring an incredible cinematography, with vivid colors and light, grandiose sets (although somewhat imaginative) and very well done details. There are, however, very specific situations and moments where the CGI was too much. The soundtrack is signed by James Newton Howard and fulfills its role well."
" Absolutely Superb
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,9,"If you like your fantasy adventure films to be well-thought-out with stellar scripting, excellent acting and clever and insightful directing, not to mention generously light-hearted humour throughout, then this film is for you.
If you are one of those who will try your utmost to find plotholes, or who lacks creative imagination, then stay away: this is not for you.On the other hand, if you want two hours of sheer enjoyment whilst being transported into a different world, then sit back and enjoy.Highly recommend."
" Boring
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,1,"This movie was such a disappointment. Boring, horrible writing, no real plot and pretty much no connection to the first movie."
" Visually cool but vapid as hell
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,3,"The cinematography, CGI, costumes, and cast were all excellent. It had the makings of a great movie, but there is very little engaging about the story and characters. It seems like the screenplay was written over a weekend, and a second draft was never even bothered with because those who wrote it knew it only existed to provide some work for a bunch of visual artists and to help some big actors to fulfill some contractual obligations. To put it bluntly, this movie would best be watched on mute while playing James Newton Howard's excellent soundtrack that he made for this hollow impersonation of a film."
" Yall got that over there?
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,2,Okay so you can always get me out for Thanksgiving and then I don't remember the name of my family staying home with my sister and the other girl who was gonna eat that baby and I guess she was going through the whole movie and was just trying to make her feel like she's not a girl anymore but she's not really sure how much I love you too much but I don't know what to say about it but she's still looking forward with it for a reason not yet to come in and say that they were not a lot like that and they didn't want to.
" Enjoyable romp
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,7,"The Huntsman: Winters War doesn't work well as a prequel to 'Snow White and the Huntsman' due to a number of anomalies pointed out by others, mainly relating to the lack of Ravenna's brother Finn in her past and the presence of a new sister. However, treat it as a separate film and it's pretty good. Chris Hemsworth plays his part well and Charlize Theron is the fairest of them all, if not the nicest. The special effects are well wrought and the adventure keeps you watching. As in the previous film, the dwarfs provide light entertainment. Enjoyable hokum and great escapism. I enjoyed it."
" A beautifully pointless sequel
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,5,"The huntsman winters war has great visuals, cool action, good acting, and a entertaining villain. But all is wasted in a boring and predictable script, uninteresting characters, unfunny comedy, romance that is boring and could have been cut, and a disappointing final battle. Not as bad as critics say but not that good."
" Better than the first one (even if some liberties were taken)
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,7,"No, seriously this one is better than Snow White and the Huntsman (not that it was bad).Hemsworth is, once again, great as the Huntsman. Theron IS the Evil Queen!!!
The addition of Blunt and Chastain to this movie added A LOT!!Those liberties,, well, they changed the story around a little,,, but that's forgivable as long as they do it well (just my opinion). Such as who killed Sara,, the queens brother did it before,, now she was never killed, only believed to be. Also,,, THE ICE QUEEN? While I very much enjoyed Blunt in this,,, they kinda borrowed from Narnia and Frozen,,, just a lil,,,All in all,,, i really enjoyed it.Watch it already!!"
" Pretty Entertaining
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,8,"I liked a lot about this but not as good as the first movie. Still pretty good. Only main thing I didn't like.. they talked a lot about Snow White, but she was never in this movie. The was a bit of a letdown. Maybe the actress wanted too much money. Who knows? Anyway liked the introduction of dwarf women. The mouthy one was a little cute I must admit. Don't think there'll be another Huntsman unless some new witches come along."
" Surprising!
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,9,"The Huntsman: Winter's War surprised me! It was way better than the first film and held way more depth. The acting was amazing this time around with Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron. The added cast Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain fit perfectly into the movie. Each character had significance and held great power. There was character development that flowed naturally.
The story was great and held no plot holes. Every event in the movie felt needed and thrilling.
The CGI was stunning. The fight scenes with the two sisters was fantastic to watch. I could feel the intense scenes building with each word of dialogue.
Overall I love it! And having Halsey sing at the end was the perfect touch."
" Chess rules
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,1,Watched it for three minutes. They broke the rules off chess. Switched off tele.
" Fell asleep
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,5,"The only thing that kept me awake was laughing at the useless attempt at a Scottish accent by two of the leading players. The fact this nonesense was nominated for two oscars only shows how far Hollywood has fallen. A poor script, average acting and quirky direction make for an average film, by no means the best of the genre. The money it cost would have been better spent on feeding the poor."
" Surprisingly fun and enjoyable! A lot better than the previous one.
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,7,"This movie way quite an enjoyable time!My expectations were pretty low to be honest, especially having seen the first one which I can't say I liked very much, but it proved me wrong. This was a fun watch.Chris Hemsworth, Jessica Chastain, Emily Blunt, Charlize Theron, obviously the cast for this movie is stacked and they great as you'd expect. Honorable mention to the dwarves. I loved them lol, there were some moments which I was laughing like an idiot :D.To get to the point though, I liked the story and the plot overall, or should I say the execution and the delivery of it. Nothing amazing or groundbreaking, but as I always say, it really doesn't have to be. If you like and you've watched a lot of schience-fiction, action, adventure and especially fairytail movies such as this one then you already know what to expect. You've pretty much seen every possible plot twist or storyline. In these kinds of movies there aren't many things that will surprise you and if you go into such a movie expecting something never seen before then you're naive imo. The name of the game with these types of movies is execution, delivery and characters. And that is what I liked about this movie. I thought the ""love makes you weak"" theme was cheesy and stupid but ultimately I liked how they developed it through the characters' story arcs.I really felt for Freya in the end :'( and I thought it was pretty sad how at the end it turned out that she did care about the huntsmen and huntwomen which she kept calling ""her children"" despite her trying to be emotionless and never show them any affection because she believed it was a weakness. In the end however when she realiazed her sister was behind everything she tried to protect them from her. The saddest thing though is that they never got to know and she died protecting them.""How lucky you are""Overall nice movie, should be a very good time with family at a Saturday night."
" Stunning visual effects
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,6,This film is pleasing to the eye. Visual effects make it worth watching. In the storyline there is nothing new or exciting. Acting is good. Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron are both excellent queens.
" All started with a superfluous Biancaneve's remake...
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,5,"...and ended with a prequel in which Biancaneve doesn't appear and of what we didn't have absolutely necessity. If you are not fan of Thor medieval-version muscles, let go. Plot carried on with efforts. Gags of characters-mascots (the gnomes) like in the easiest entertainment movies for kids. Superfluous."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,6,"Pretty good movie with an interesting story and some cool scenes. i enjoyed it for the most part. it also could have been a lot better. there were some missed opportunities. (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
there were definitely a bunch of surprises in the story and twist moments. some were great, others were poorly handled. the ice image of his wife dying was a huge surprise. her being sent by the ice queen could have been a good surprise but the reveal was so poorly done. I suspected it but it still could have been a nice addition. and the one about charlize's character backstabbing her sister was also good, but could have been great."
" Magnificent
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,10,It is an amazing movie and sequal to the last movie all the characters were well fitted to their roles and all the characters acting was magnificent
" A slight inferior than the first Huntsman!!!
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,7,"I' really love fantasy' movies, l'd watched the first Huntsman and found it slight inferior, perhaps for the previous one was the original and resounding on first sigh, this time the story is told by backwards when Ravenna's sister the young Freya was introduce to us, after having an affair with his beloved suitor who intend to marry her, she has a baby girl, but her daughter is killed on the bed by his promised husband himself, so she went away to northern ice lands to reign there with angry ice force, receiving children from everywhere Queen Freya rules on ice iron hands, the Huntsman and Sara are growing up together, this compelling story stays more strong when the real characters appears, yeah the funny double drawfs, wait a minute some minutes ahead another two them were included, now two female drawfs, thus make sense a romantic couple, stop for a while, there a bitter couple aside, well the picture pays himself for two great reasons only, the invaluable drawfs and the endless beauty coming from Charlize Theron, to me the most beautiful actress on earth!!!Resume:First watch: 2019 / How many: 1 / Source: Blu-Ray / Rating: 7.25"
" The Huntsman: Winter's War
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,4,"Snow White and the Huntsman was a reasonable dark take on the classic fairytale, nothing compared to the genius Disney cartoon of course, but not bad, this follow-up served as borth a prequel and a sequel combined, I had my guesses what it might be like. Evil sorceress Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) has a younger sister Freya (Emily Blunt), whose powers have not emerged. Using her evil magic, Ravenna not only finds out that Freya has been having an affair with already elsewhere engaged nobleman Andrew (Merlin's Colin Morgan), but she is pregnant with his child. Freya gives birth to a baby girl but is enraged not only to find Andrew has broken his promise for elopement, but he murdered their child. Fuelled by grief and rage, Freya's broken heart freezes over, and kills Andrew with her newfound powers, the elemental control of ice. Freya abandons her sister's kingdom and builds herself a new kingdom up North and becomes known and feared as the Ice Queen. She orders that all parents are killed, and the children abducted and trained to become huntsman for a fearsome army to conquer for her. Eric (Chris Hemsworth) and Sara (Jessica Chastain) go through training and grow up to become huntsman, but they also fall in love, with Sara claiming ""marriage"" with a metal medallion necklace, and Eric promising never to leave her side. But before Eric and Sara can escape together, Freya discovers their secret love, confronts them, and creates a massive ice wall to separate them. Eric watches as Sara is killed by another huntsman, while he is beaten and thrown into the fast-flowing river. Seven years later, after Ravenna's death, Queen Snow White has fallen ill, the power of the Magic Mirror is the most likely cause, so she has ordered it to Sanctuary, the magical place that can shelter and contain its power. Snow White's husband, King William (Sam Claflin), informs Eric that the soldiers tasked with carrying the Mirror went missing whilst heading the Sanctuary. Knowing that the powerful dark magic of the Mirror can make Freya even stronger, perhaps even invincible, Eric agrees to investigate and attempt to retrieve the Mirror. He reluctantly allows Snow White's dwarf ally Nion (Nick Frost) and his annoying half-brother Gryff (Rob Brydon) to come along. They travel to the last known location of the soldiers, Eric determines that they killed each other, most likely as they possessed by the Mirror's powers. At a tavern, the trio are attacked by a group of Freya's huntsmen, until they are rescued by a still alive Sara, it turns out she was imprisoned the whole time, Eric was falsely made to see her die, and she falsely watched him abandon her. Sara joins Eric, Nion and Gryff, the quartet end up ensnared in a trap set by she-dwarfs Bromwyn (Sheridan Smith) and Doreena (Alexandra Roach), but they come to an agreement and the she-dwarfs to join them find the Mirror. The next day the group travel across a bridge in the forest where goblins that stole the Mirror live, the party fights off the goblins and retrieve the Mirror, and eventually the monsters are defeated. As the group travels near the Sanctuary with the Mirror, they are ambushed by Freya and her huntsmen. Freya reveals Sara has been loyal to her all along, using her companions to find the Mirror for her. In the ensuing chaos, Nion and Doreena are turned into ice statues, and Sara shoots an arrow into Eric's chest on Freya's order, he falls and appears to have died. Freya departs with the Magic Mirror, but she is unaware that Eric survived, Sara purposely hit the metal medallion, protecting him from the arrow, he realises she loves him. At the palace, Freya recites the spell ""Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all"", this resurrects Ravenna, her soul became one with the Mirror when Snow White vanquished her into it. Ravenna boasts her restored and improved powers, usurps Freya's rule, coordinating the huntsmen and army to reclaim the kingdoms Snow White had liberated. Eric infiltrates the ice palace with help of Gryff and Bromwyn. Freya realises Sara did not kill Eric, and manipulated by Ravenna, sentences them both to death. However Eric is able to convince a few huntsmen to rebel, Ravenna begins killing them, but Freya, who regards them as being like her children, creates an ice wall to separate them. As Eric, Sara and the other huntsmen climb over the wall, the two sisters argue over the ice kingdom. Ravenna lets slip that she is responsible for her sister's awakening of her powers, the Mirror reveals that it had told that Freya's child would become more beautiful than Ravenna. The queen enchanted Andrew to kill the baby so she would remain ""the fairest of them all"", now aware of the truth Freya is outraged of her sister's betrayal and deception, she finally turns against her. Freya is impaled by Ravenna, but with her remaining strength she freezes the Magic Mirror, Eric takes advantage and shatters the Mirror, thus destroying Ravenna. In her last moments, Freya is happy to see a vision of herself holding her child, and Eric and Sara's devotion for each other, she smiles and dies. All those imprisoned by Freya's magic are freed, including Nion and Doreena, Eric and Sara share a kiss, and peace is restored to the kingdom, but it is unclear if evil has been defeated once and for all. Narrated by Liam Neeson, and also starring Sope Dirisu as Tull, Sam Hazeldine as Leifr, Sophie Cookson as Pippa and Ralph Ineson as Barkeep. Hemsworth is alright as the leading huntsman, Blunt is reasonable as the sort-of villain, Chastain is fine, Frost, Brydon and Smith are humorous as the dwarves, and Theron is fabulously evil. The absence of Kristen Stewart (who had an affair with the previous film's director!) is obvious, with a very thinly papered over plot, there are some reasonably well put together fight sequences, and the special effects are as good as you'd expect, but the first movie was much more interesting, a disappointing but not awful dark fantasy action adventure. Okay!"
" Loved It
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,10,I loved this so much more than the first one. Good Film.
" Cheap lord of the rings rip off
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,2,Budget version of LOTR basically - but shorter and less interesting and loosely based on the snow white story.And the accents...just why? Why are they Glaswegian?
" A bit naff... too much shakycam AGAIN!
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,2,I got fed up trying to watch it especially when the camera shakes every time there is any fighting.
" Cool costumes, zero substance
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,1,"Liked their makeup, their suits, their cool jewelry, their fight scenes but the plot is dumb and the whole movie even dumber. I did watch it through the whole thing though. While working out. So... very boring."
" The Huntsman: Winter's War Review
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,8,"Seven years after Snow White defeated the evil Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron), Eric the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) tries to keep the Magic Mirror away from Ravenna's sister - the equally cruel Ice Queen (Emily Blunt).
Although sold heavily in trailers as a prequel to 2012's dark fairy-tale remix Snow White And The Huntsman, the bulk of this follow-up actually takes place after that film's events. It's a small detail, but an important one, in the sense that it speaks to a wider confusion of intent that turns Winter's War from a fitfully enjoyable hunk of fantasy nostalgia into a perplexing tangle of different timelines and retconned plot threads.Hemsworth does a decent impression of a man enjoying himself, but it's hard to see the wood for the enchanted trees.
The core tale starts simply enough. Gravelly narration shows us nascent wicked stepmother Ravenna (Charlize Theron, gamely selling the overwrought cackling) in her pre-Snow White days and briskly sets up the tragic death that turns her kindly sister Freya (Emily Blunt) into the fearsomely powerful Elsa-alike Ice Queen. Newly fitted with a hardened heart, kick-ass frozen palace and Karl Lagerfeld hair, Freya sets about turning orphans from the villages she topples into an army of adorable killers who will grow to be her Huntsmen (never mind that half of them are women).Two of these deadly warriors are Eric and Sara (Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain, armed with ill-advised Celtic accents), who, in defiance of their queen's wishes, fall in love and plot an escape that ends in disaster. Seven years later, with Snow White indisposed (original star Kristen Stewart has been dealt a poisoned apple and doesn't even appear in flashback), Eric is enlisted to find the Magic Mirror before it falls into Freya's frigid clutches.
Thus begins (eventually) the strongest portion of the film, as Eric and a band of misfits - including Rob Brydon, Nick Frost, Sheridan Smith and Alexandra Roach stealing scenes as a quartet of boisterously offensive dwarves - chase the requisite mystical MacGuffin through a visually striking fantasyscape. Hemsworth, despite the anaesthetised Braveheart voice, does a decent impression of a man enjoying himself and French director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan (promoted from his visual effects role on the first film) brings an exhilarating intensity to a battle with a horde of goblins.But in the end it's hard to see the wood for the enchanted trees. Allegiances switch back and forth, obvious twists come lolloping over the horizon and it all starts to resemble stray fantasy elements - Lord Of The Rings, Frozen, Willow - cynically thrown into a whirring blender with the lid off. ""This is the worst plan ever,"" says Eric, not long before a set-up for another sequel lands with all the subtlety of a swinging axe. Hard to argue with that.Visual inventiveness and spectacular casting can't quite salvage a muddled fantasy epic that, if it were a magic mirror, would be held together with gaffer tape."
" Has its moments
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,5,"Story is okaydialogue is cringy at timesCGI is 6/10The movie starts out rather serious, then decides it does not want to be so serious. Then is serious again, then not so serious.
This alternation between beeing serious and slacking off makes this hard to watch.The jokes and relieves (relieves to wich tension exactly?) are well delivered.
Towards the middle, the movie reaches peak mediocre. Stuff gets done for no reason, there is a fight with trolls/cobolts/whatever for, suddenly Eric crossed the bridge he just destroyed?
The final ""fight"" is completly boring, the final heroic action of the ""not-so-evil""-ice queen is expected at that point. Main characters, Eric and Sara both shrug off their near demise and walk off. Personally, the two dwarfs, Nion and Doreena were less cold hearted than Eric and Sara.
Mrs Blunt played the dying queen rather well though."
" Enjoyed it
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,7,"Good movie for what it is. it had more humour than the original. Hemsworth is a cheeky gorgeous actor and Charlize Theron always chews up the scenery nicely. Jessica Chastain is a good actress although I don't find her particularly engaging in this role. I actually liked Emily Blunt's understated performance, she was quite compelling. The best actress was the lusty female dwarf with the bad ass lines - she added real spark. Overall I missed Kristin Stewart and wish she could have played Chastain's role. I thought she and Hemsworth had far better chemistry."
" Great movie, but great music too!
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Another review of this movie might not really be needed by now, and I can only agree with most others I've read: pleasantly surprised; fantastic costumes; nice CGI but not overdone; movie not too long; ok and logical plot; superb acting by the four leading roles. It's hard to say what the intended audience is: sometimes the movie was a tad childish (which is why I don't rate the movie even higher), at other times it was rather dark/grim. The reason why I am writing this review is to say something about the film score. It's so good! It's traditional fantasy movie music (think LotR or so) but it's much more than just good craftsmanship; listen to the music carefully and you'll see both how good it is by itself and how well attuned and responsive it is to the different scenes. Great job by the composing team!"
" How many right guesses did you have?
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,2,"Oh my god. First of all, you should understand that even if this movie was based on children stories, the target audience isn't children, so feel free and review the title as an adult. I couldn't digest the stupid story.Here it is:
They made a city on a bridge over the river. WTH? Was that a necessary imagination?Because of grief and anger, Queen Freya decides to move North and build a kingdom, take kids, make an army and rule. What?So, they killed their parents and they're all just fine. They're tough for no reason and adapt fast and easily. We see they become warriors in two days. Yes, mutants. And the music when they're training is epic. Wasn't that a bad thing?Queen Freya can make owls out of ice or perhaps iced a real owl and can control it! Oh my god. Somebody explain it to me please. Anything is possible for her. But why one owl? Why owl at all? Why not an army of men? Why don't we see other possibilities or any explanation?Jessica Chastain's accent and acting. 2 points right here.How did they fall in love? And they marry in two hours.The fleeing plan was very funny. They decided to flee seconds after the marriage. And the next day they're going to honeymoon without even considering guards. And they're smiling, OMG. What were they thinking?Queen Freya can make you see different things on ice. OK.7 years passed and neither Eric nor his clothes didn't change a bit. Was he frozen all these years?What was the role of dwarfs? Didn't make any change to the plan. Could be easily removed.When they're trying to escape from goblins and all except Eric passed the bridge, we see a dead goblin on the other side, just so that she could have all equipments and specially some oil for her arrow.""I never miss!"" We already knew that. Enough with stupid lines.He's dead, but... wait... he's alive, noooooooooooo waaaay, thaaat waaaaas soooo originaaaaal.""She never misses!"" OMG.What did those two dwarfs do after breaking the castle? Nothing.Eric could have made that last speech earlier when he was trying to flee with Sara to convince his friends to turn against Queen. They turned easily.And they lived happily ever after.To sum up, the plot is awful, subplots have nothing to do with the story. For example remove dwarfs or goblins subplot. At least 1 hour could be clipped.
And you can easily guess most parts. It was one the cheesiest scripts I've ever watched.
I just gave a 2 for its visual effects, that's what I get in these kind of movies."
" Frolic in the Kingdom
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,5,"Hollywood's ingredients to make this movie
1 x Hunky Hero,
1 x Comedic Hero's Partners,
1 x Evil WomanAdd a dash of an extremely poor Sean Connery accent and a sprinkling of Disney (Frozen)
Give to a director to ruin and you have a Bird's Eye movie.I used Google translate to try and understand Chris Helmsworth,s drunken Scottish accent, being Scottish makes it even wors."
" Exquisite
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,10,"Much much better than the prequel.
Touches perfection!
Note: What annoyed me the most was the fact that in the previous movie Eric fell in love with Snow White (he mentioned that she reminded him of his wife) but yet in this sequel he seemed irrevocably devoted to his partner Sarah. This does not make sense, bearing in mind that practically he was the ""Prince on the white horse "" who -by kissing her- brought Snow White back from the dead. This was somehow disappointing. Still, it's a pure 10 !"
" Unnecessary Prequel/Sequel!
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,6,"There's plenty of reviews of THWW, so for something different, I'm just going to list some observations that caught my eye.Charlize Theron is a great negotiator if what I heard about her receiving the same salary ($11 million) as Chris Hemsworth is correct. It's a while before Hemsworth makes an appearance, but from thereon, the film is focussed on his character. In a close to 2 hour film, Charlize is only in it for around 25 minutes at best.The film does have a great cast and Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt do wear quite amazing costumes. However can't say the same about some of the wigs those 2 ladies wore which looked extremely obvious in some scenes, to say the least.Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman/Eric is a much more agreeable and likeable character in this film, than the earlier one. This is pretty amazing when we consider his upbringing, which we see in this film, combined with the ""tragic death"" of his wife from the earlier film.I really like Jessica Chastain's Sarah, but the over-complicated plot line restricted the important flow of chemistry, that should have occurred between Sarah and Eric. Questions such as whether she was, or was not, brainwashed are never fully clarified.The dwarves this time around just appeared to be generally unnecessary sources of comic relief, whereas in the first film, they had crucial roles to play. Where exactly in the film do they ever achieve some sort of positive outcome by themselves? I can't remember anywhere except perhaps when they help carry the mirror for a bit. They always seemed to go missing in the action sequences. I'm not sure whether it was a continuity issue, but in the final confrontation in the castle we see 2 of the dwarves go to the trouble to sneak inside the castle and then ... that's it. They don't seem to have anything to do with the finale, until everything is all hugs and kisses pre-final credits (which were good).Speaking of confrontations, I simply don't remember a Winter's War occurring, bearing in mind wars generally take a bit of time and are fought between opposing armies, which I didn't see here.The action scenes if anything, are better than those in the first film and I liked seeing Jessica Chastain in very much an action role, even if she did channel Evangeline Lilly from The Hobbit trilogy.Contrasting to the first film again and it was just hard to believe how quickly Eric chooses to seek to recover the mirror, compared to the first film when he was literally dragged kicking and screaming to participate in proceedings.The whole children's army thing didn't really work in my eyes. It's like the director/writers had an idea for something and then wimped out on doing anything really interesting with it.Ultimately the film was of some passing interest, but definitely won't live in my memory."
" Worse than the first...
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,4,"""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" is an Action - Drama movie and the sequel of ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". In this movie, we watch a couple who is raised by the evil Ice Queen trying to hide their forbidden love and in the meantime, they have to fight in order to survive from the wicked intentions of both Ice Queen and her sister Ravenna.I had already watched ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" when I saw that this movie was released so, I watched it expecting something more from the first one. Unfortunately, I was let down by it because its plot wasn't very bad but boring and even worse than the first one. One more thing that I didn't like was the bad direction which was made by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan and reminded me of the direction of Rupert Sanders in the first movie. In addition to this, I have to say that the interpretation of Chris Hemsworth who played as the Huntsman / Eric was average as it was also the interpretation of Jessica Chastain who played as Sara and she didn't reach her potential. The only interpretation that I liked from this movie was Emily Blunt's who played as Ice Queen / Queen Freya and she was very good at it.Finally, I believe that ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" is another average movie which either you watch it or not it will be the same. If you have two hours and you want to waste them then just watch this movie. Don't expect much from it because you are going to be disappointed by it and also don't expect it to be better than the first movie for the same reason."

" Wow, tons of hot women
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,6,Dang this movie has 3 very hot women in it. You would think this movie is for women with ONE hot male. Still it's a good movie. Is it 7 or above? No. Just a good movie above average.
" Good action.
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,9,"Definitely better, good action, no dull moments and good acting."
" Formulaic
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,6,"It was watching colour by numbers. Formulaic dialogue. Formulaic plot. Absolutely nothing interesting about the story line. It wasn't unpleasant, but nothing about it makes me want to recommend it."
" A fun watch
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,7,"It's basically Frozen meets Lord of the Rings meets the first Snow White, minus Kristen Stewart which I guess is a good thing."
" A nice sequel, and THREE female leads in addition to Chris Hemsworth!
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,7,"I saw this recently on Netflix; I enjoyed it and now I kind of wish I'd seen it in the theater. As a sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman (2012) which had reasonable and well deserved success, this one stands up well. The first one took the bare bones of the Snow White fairy tale (the captive princess, the evil witch queen, dwarfs, the poisoned apple, and a prince) and built a lot of extra stuff around it to make a thoroughly enjoyable 2 hours of fantasy-adventure. This second one is an entirely new story owing almost nothing to the fairytale but again, it's a fun 2 hours with many of the same advantages: great atmospheric wilderness settings, characters with at least a little bit of depth to them, and overall a good-natured feel to it -- yes, evil has its innings, the perils are convincingly dire and frightening, but we know that love and goodness will triumph. The storyline follows the general outline that you'd expect, but it's got some fun surprises too.There are 4 almost-equal lead actors (Chris Hemsworth, Jessica Chastain, Emily Blunt, Charlize Theron), so lots of star power -- and can you think of ANY other fantasy adventure with three female leads? Sign of things to come, I hope. They're all good. Just like in the first one, Hemsworth isn't the imperious God of Thunder here; he plays an action hero all right, but he's affably clumsy at times, and the fight scenes tend to be a bit of a mess. Of the leads, Hemsworth (Australian) and Chastain (American) affect Scottish accents, and pretty strong ones too. Blunt (English) and Theron (South African), on the other hand, stick to fairly normal movie-American accents. Theron plays Ravenna once again as an irredeemably and self-indulgently evil queen, chewing the scenery along the way -- but isn't that just what an evil fairytale queen is supposed to do? She sells it. Blunt provides a nice contrast as her sister. She's been pushed, by her sister, into evil doings herself, but isn't irredeemable. I won't give away the surprises that come along as the characters mix and match, but they give the storyline added richness.
 
The settings and set designs are I think first-rate. They have almost a Middle-Earth kind of feel to them. Blunt's snow-queen hairdo by itself is totally impressive -- a lot of thought went into that, and much else besides. Ravenna, who could turn herself into a flock of evil black birds in Snow White, can do the same this time but the birds now are golden, a result of her absorption by the mirror and her only half-human state.And, we get some dwarfs again, this time with two men and two women (though once again, they are normal-size actors and actresses visually de-sized on the screen). They provide most of the comic relief, but in a nicely different way than with the seven in Snow White; there's a lot of fun byplay amongst the two pairs, and all four have clearly different personalities.Not deep, but well done entertainment. If you've been missing Lord of the Rings-type movies, this one and its predecessor will keep you going."
" Terrible
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,3,"One star for the dwarves because they are funny (and good in this), one for Emily Blunt because I love her (she's great in this too) and one for Chris Hemsworth because he's gorgeous and everything else about this movie is god awful. This is another one of those movies with shoddy writers must have written this by throwing darts at a board... ok so the darts landed on 1) quest for lost item 2) evil queen 3) love wins and 4) couple who hates but secretly loves each other ...but that's not even the worst of it. Jessica Chastains terrible Scottish accent is encredibly distracting, I mean it is god AWEFUL! Why the director didn't just tell her to stop and use her own accent, I have no idea but he/she should have. It's very obvious that she's not pulling it off so that was a massive drop of the ball from the director. Chris' isn't much better ether but his Australian accent covers it up a bit.The chemistry between JC and CH is non existent and the one liners are boring and predictable. I haven't watched Enchanted but it seems like this might be the live action version of that, it's also very close to the Chrinicals of Narnia. The ice queen story has been done before and it's always done the same so something new for her story would be nice because she's a cool idea.This movie would have been better as a made for TV movie because it reminds me of those awesome but cheesy D&D Sunday night TV movies. That way they wouldn't have wasted all that money and people wouldn't have disliked it so much because they would have accepted it for what it is and not expected to much from it."
" Mostly Boring
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,3,"So, it's been a while since I've seen this movie so this might not be all that accurate, but who cares?
I watched this movie when it first came out because while the first one wasn't all that brilliant Charlize Theron was a treasure and it seemed like she'd be in it a lot. And she did return. For the last ten minutes. Maybe twenty. It seemed as though the focus would be on the Ice Queen and Ravenna a lot more than it was at the end, most of the story was about the Huntsman and his wife, a story arc that was completely uninteresting. The wife had no real character to speak of and was relatively two-dimensional. You couldn't have completely taken out of the story, I'll admit that, because she did have to be there for at least a few plot points, but there were a lot of scenes where they just walked around and nothing really seemed to happen. It worked in LOTR. It didn't work in this movie. The Ice Queen was also pretty boring, with barely anything to do. The only thing interesting about this movie was every scene with Charlize Theron, which were preciously rare. The relationship between the Ice Queen and Ravenna, the twisted sisterhood would have been interesting to see developed, as well as Ravenna's transformation from a strange but human witch to a strange human/witch/mirror hybrid. The final action scene did have some interesting things but it was sad to see this powerful Ice Queen be defeated by her sister so quickly, only for a human to defeat her. He's a badass but you'd still think the other woman with powers would do more. It seemed wrong to have one of the most powerful characters suddenly take a back seat, espescially since I doubt this would've happened had it been an Ice King.Sadly, I'm probably still gonna watch it if there's ever another movie with Charlize Theron in this franchise."
" Kristen Stewart Cameo was needed
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,7,"The movies overall was good...but Kristen Stewart as Snow White, her presence was very much needed to improve the plot of the film.
It didn't happen though. That was the disappointing portion of the movie. It a third sequel is made, please add the original cast members too along with the new ones."
" Worth Seeing
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,7,"The Huntsman: Winter's War. Friendly but tetchy Dwarfs, ghastly Goblins and miniature Gollum lookalikes who are nice and helpful. Beautiful production design with great costumes and good acting from Emily Blunt, Jessica Chastain & Charlize Theron. Chris Hemsworth was meh. A prequel and a sequel as the previous film is glossed over with a Seven Years Later screen card. The script and direction lagged a bit but worth seeing. Oh, the plot? As two evil sisters prepare to conquer the land; two renegades - Eric the Huntsman - who previously aided Snow White in defeating Ravenna, and his forbidden lover, Sara set out to stop them.6.5/10"
" Mish-mash of genre tropes
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,4,"THE HUNTSMAN: WINTER'S WAR is a belated sequel to SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN, thankfully ditching Kristen Stewart's character (yay!) and focusing instead on Chris Hemsworth's dashing but one-note hero. This is one of those stories that serves as both prequel and sequel, but in the main it turns out to be a mish-mash of genre tropes and themes utilised better in the likes of the NARNIA trilogy. Charlize Theron is bypassed and has little screen time, with the bulk villain duties instead given over to an insipid (and utterly unimposing) Emily Blunt. Jessica Chastain plays a single-note warrior woman while film as a whole is obsessed with constant CGI scenery and effects at the detriment of any discernable storyline. Indeed, the dialogue and plot are both full of cliches, with Hemsworth's character alone seemingly killed two or three times in various hackneyed moments of high drama. I did enjoy the first movie, to a degree, but this one's a step too far in the wrong direction."
" Lacks Original an Innovative Ideas
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,5,"According to legend, the reason why Rupert Sanders and Kristen Stewart were blackballed from ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" was due to the esoteric affair they had during the 2012 film ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". I'll take it as a possibility. But if that's the case then why were all but two members of the Seven Dwarfs return and the other five didn't get called back? Granted their absentees didn't matter much, ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" proves to be nothing more than a sequel that lacks fresh ideas or any creative merits that was never needed to be filmed and was just an excuse to carry it as a potential franchise. Here we go again.Chris Hemsworth returns as Eric the Huntsman and is once again on the brink of another epic battle with the evil Ravenna (Charlize Theron) and has brought along her younger sister Freya (Emily Blunt) to the scene. Freya has less baggage of wrath than her sister and has converted to evilness due to the loss of child by her killer ex-lover. Feeling that love is non-existent, Freya gather a platoon of highly-skilled fighters located in her ice castle. These fighters were once children who were once kidnapped and were trained to become deadly warriors to the point of being quite the untouchables once they reached adulthood. One of them is Eric (Hemsworth) the fighter who was instrumental in helping Snow White defeat Ravenna, The other is Sara (Jessica Chastain) another strong fighter whom Eric is in love with.Prior to his supposed death scene for breaking Freya's no-love compromise, Eric is thrown from a cliff but survives, but his lover sadly is placed to her death. The story then follows up from the events of the first installment as Eric was assigned from orders of the King by an ill Queen Snow White, to retrieve the magic mirror which was an integral part of Ravenna's pompous ways of exploiting her beauty was stolen. So Eric is joined by the comical dwarfs Nion (Nick Frost) and Gryff (Rob Brydon), they set out to find the mirror before Ravenna does and uses it for her evil purposes.While it does have a very in depth look at Eric's origins, 'The Huntsman: Winter's War"" doesn't have much going for it plus the sole purpose this movie was made was to put a hole through our wallets and to start a potential franchise. There's no wide open expansion in their universe, the atmosphere is opaque and dreary though tone here seems more lighter than anticipated. Hemsworth was all right as the leading protagonist and does well with the material that was given to him. But his charisma is quite limited in a role that requires a vast amount of it and to make matters worse, he's forced into speaking in an unorthodox accent which he's intended to sound Scottish, but it weaves to sound closer to Irish on and off. Freya as a villainous is quite unconvincing as she's porttrayed as being just generally depressed over full-blown evil. Things start to heat up one Ravenna enters the fray by the the time the movie is half-over. By then it's too little too late and there's really not much to do to set the tone of this film. Even Theron's presence with her icy complexion and her flawless beauty could save this film."
" Really poor accents.
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,1,I thought Charlize Theron's accent was the worst. Also she didn't seem evil to me at all. Really poor acting by Theron. I thought Theron's accent in the first movie was even worse. Hollywood is really beginning to suck at picking lead actors.
" What does the mirror show you?
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,8,"The film starts out as the prequel to Snow White and then turns into a sequel. The evil Ravenna (Charlize Theron) had a sister Freya (Emily Blunt) who started an ice kingdom up north which she extended with the help of specially trained fighters. Through a long twisted series of circumstances, ""The Mirror"" becomes stolen and must be returned.I won't say anything more specific about the plot, it easy to spoil. Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain are the two main characters looking for the mirror. The scenes include the enchanted forest with goblins and dwarfs. The accents varied on the characters. Hemsworth grunted like Rocky and later impersonated Dave Winfield (August 4, 1983 Toronto) . Chastain would feign a slight Irish accent. I loved the plot and the twists up until the end.The theme of the film is ""Love conquers all""....I thinkGuide: PG-13 violence. Nude implication with couple in water. Language such as ""bitch"" and KMA. No Kristen Stewart, Snow White shown once from the back.Note to self: Cut ropes to bridge after you cross."
" The story lacks depth
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,5,"The movie is OK on its own...sort of. It just feels so disjointed from the previous one. Even the feel of it is off. I wish they wouldn't have warped the entire story and I believe they should have still gone with Stewart despite the scandal. I thoroughly enjoyed Snow White and the Huntsman, where the huntsman had a connection to her...while here, the romance seems flimsy and lacks depth, the imagery is off as well, everything is way too happy - you can easily tell it's a different director. Furthermore, because of the feelings he made known in the previous film, the huntsman's relationship his 'beloved' feels false and forced. Basically, if they weren't going to carry on with the tone and direction of the initial movie, they should have just left it alone."
" In my top 10
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,10,"Mirror mirror on the wall.. Define me a good movie. Oh that is very simple - a movie that is entertaining, relaxing, makes you smile, address your imagination, it has a good pace, you're not bored one moment and you come back to see it. This movie - has all that. I cannot think of a better movie than this. For me this felt more like LOTR but more chilled and I had more confidence in Chris. I made an account to write this review after seeing the existing reviews. I hope they will make more of it. Thinking of better movies... Warcraft? Is good but the rhythm is not as good nor is it so positive and relaxing. No country for old men? It has a rubbish ending. True Romance? Maybe... that also has moments where you want to ff. RocknRolla? Masterpiece but is a bit too urban for me. Edge of Tomorrow - second half is not as good - I keep watching only first half. Sicario, Pirates of the Caribbean, Payback are also getting close but The Huntsman - both movies - have something different - a flow of energy and continuity which none other has."
" So I guess Kristen Stewart wasn't the problem?
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,6,"There's nothing worse than casting top notch talent and underusing them. The only time this film was great was when blunt and Theron were on screen together, and that wasn't much. The plot was confusing and after reading the trivia that it's both a prequel and sequel I understand why. We all know chris hemsworth can carry a film when there is great writing. There was none of that here. If it was to be a film about the huntsman, far more character development and plot was needed. As it was, he was not the most captivating character in the film, falling short because he is the title character."
" Snow White without the Princess
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,4,"You've heard of ""Hamlet"" without the Prince. Now we have ""Snow White"" without the Princess. ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" is, officially, both a prequel and sequel to ""Snow White and the Huntsman""- the action takes place both before and after the events of the first film- but Snow White does not actually appear in it, even though she is mentioned on a couple of occasions. The film also borrows a few ideas from ""The Snow Queen"" by Hans Christian Andersen, or possibly from ""Frozen"", the Disney adaptation of Andersen's story.Although Snow White does not appear, Charlize Theron's evil Queen Ravenna returns from the earlier film. The main villainess, however, is Ravenna's younger sister Freya, who rules her own kingdom, a land of ice and snow, in the far north, and who remains in power even after Ravenna has been overthrown. As the title implies, Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman also returns. We learn that, in this context, the word ""Huntsman"" does not necessarily mean ""man who hunts animals"". The Huntsmen are the elite troops of Freya's army, trained in the arts of war from childhood, and Hemsworth's character, Eric, is one of these. He incurs Freya's displeasure, however, when he falls in love with a female Huntsman, Sara. (Freya's army is an equal opportunities employer). As Freya has replaced the Ten Commandments with one of her own, ""thou shalt not love"", Eric is banished from the kingdom and Sara put to death.I won't set out the rest of the plot because it is essentially a mish-mash of clichés drawn from every sword-and-sorcery adventure you've ever seen. I said above that the film borrows from ""The Snow Queen""; it also borrows heavily- as do most modern sword-and-sorceries- from ""Lord of the Rings"", both Tolkien's novel and Peter Jackson's three films. Like ""Lord of the Rings"" it revolves around an evil ruler trying to get his/her hands on a magical artefact, in this case Ravenna's magic mirror, which will give him/her immense power. In both cases the aforesaid evil ruler is opposed by an assorted group of good guys, in this case Eric and a few dwarfs, both male and female. (It is a general rule of the fantasy genre that dwarfs and elves are good, trolls and goblins evil). Besides the dwarfs, Eric also has the assistance of Sara, rumours of whose death prove to have been much exaggerated. (That's not a spoiler. No film company is going to hire a major star like Jessica Chastain and kill her off in the first reel).Although this is officially an American film, only one of the actors playing the main characters is American; Hemsworth is Australian, Theron South African and Emily Blunt (Freya) British. The one exception is Chastain, and even she does not sound American. Like a number of the other characters she speaks her lines in what is supposed to be a Scottish accent. Now I was not worried that some of these accents were not completely accurate- the action takes place in a fairy-tale fantasy world, not in the real Scotland- but I did wonder why an American studio were making a film using accents that many American viewers would have difficulty with.I never really thought of Blunt as being a Charlize Theron look-alike, but here the two actresses are made up to look convincingly similar; you could certainly take them for sisters. Where Blunt has difficulty is in trying to suggest a difference in personality. The script suggests that, unlike the bad-through-and-through Ravenna, Freya may not be completely evil and that she may have a softer side to her character, although she keeps it well hidden. (Ravenna, for example, would probably have killed both Eric and Sara outright rather than letting them live). Blunt never, however, really suggests this in her portrayal; the most that comes across is that Freya is only 99% evil, which is not such a big improvement on the full hundred. Theron herself was rather splendid in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"", but does not make the same impression here.I am old enough to remember just how bad fantasy films could be in the pre-Jackson era. (Think, if you can bear to, of ""Conan the Barbarian"" or ""Prince Valiant""). Even otherwise distinguished directors could make fools of themselves when they ventured into this territory, Ridley Scott's ""Legend"" and Richard Fleischer's spectacularly awful ""Red Sonja"" being cases in point Admittedly, in the 2010s no film could get away with special effects as inadequate as those used in ""Red Sonja"" and other eighties adventures, and those in ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" are generally well done, but that is no more than we have come to expect from the genre in recent years. Visual effects alone, however, are not enough; those film-makers who want to emulate Jackson's achievement need a story as good as Tolkien's, a literate script and first-class acting, and those are all qualities in which this film is deficient. ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is not in the ""Lord of the Rings"" class, but it still has plenty to enjoy. Not so its successor. 4/10"
" A disaster - what a waste of such a great cast
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,1,Even such a collection of stars - so appealing on their own can't save a movie which has a bad story that I actually was bored most of the movie. I love almost everything Jessica Chastain and Charlize Theron do. But there is no saving this terribly weak story.The good points: 1. Emily Blunt looks pretty here - more so than usual. 2. Charlize is stunningly beautiful as well. The costumes of the 2 queens are grandly done. 3. Jessica Chastain is good at action.The bad points: 1. Couldn't understand what Chris Hemsworth was saying. They should have abandoned the Shrek like Scottish accents 2. The dwarfs weren't funny 3. The story is absurd - looking for a silly mirror and killing her niece.Terrible. Serves them right for dumping K Stew.
" Surprisingly good
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,8,"I'm not going to say much about this movie, I'm sorry that people have experienced this movie as ""bad"" while I think that's not the way it is. The interpretations are okay and the story is really nice when you think about it. It's one of the few movies that have kept me fascinated lately compared to other blockbusters. I found the visual effects fantastic, you never knew what would happen next and it was not predictable like other movies. The trailer of the movie just made me curious enough to watch the movie and I found it fantastic."
" awful accents
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,5,"I am Scottish born and bred but I had difficulty understanding what Chris Hemsworth and some of the other players were saying. A French-Armenian director has no idea of the nuances of regional accents and should have steered clear of them. Just have everyone use standard English and not mangle the sounds of Scotland.Another obvious problem with this film is how much is derived from Game of Thrones, in look, content and concept. Little girls practicing archery is such a cliché these days. African warriors on horseback are another anachronism that third rate movies like to insert for some reason, perhaps to defend against accusations of racism? But not for historical accuracy even in a fantasy set in pre-renaissance Europe."
" Awesome
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,10,"Although this movie did not do well in the box office, I thought it was great. It was cool to see how the Evil Queen uses evil to give her sister some power, but it takes heartbreak in order for it to occur. The Winter Queen does not allow anyone in her kingdom to fall in love, because of this heartbreak, and in the end she finds out the truth and is devastated. I thought it was a great sequel, good cast, good plot, just overall good."
" Pretty bad
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,3,"That's all I feel it is worthy of stating in this review. If you're super bored and there is seriously NOTHING else on or in your libraries at your fingertips - watch this. Otherwise literally watch anything else. Well not anything else, there are movies I would rate under a 3, but there are an infinite (yeah) amount 3.1 & up."
" Not as impressive as the Snow White one but quite good anyway
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,7,"This is kind of a prequel and a sequel to Snow White and The Huntsman. It is not as impressive as the first movie but quite good anyway. I would call it a nice family movie although probably not for the youngest members of the family.The story is partly before and partly after the events in Snow White and The Huntsman. It is a good adventure with plenty of magic and special effects and a fair bit of action. It is a fairly straightforward story without much in terms of surprises.There is a bit of comical relief in particular by the dwarfs, especially when the two dwarfs following the huntsman encounters the grumpy female one and her friend.Apart from the classical Snow White setting, quite good special effects and quite decent action this is a fairly normal fantasy adventure movie. It is about two hours of good fun but does not really reach wow-status."
" **
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,4,"Even beautiful cinematography cannot save this 2016 film with Charlize Theron portraying an evil queen who starts off the film by killing her husband or lover during a game of chest. This cold calculating character with a miserable veneer is absolutely loveless and when she sees her sister in love with the man who fathered the latter's child, she has the baby and lover put to death and it takes the entire film for her sister to discover this evil deed.The sister goes off to another land with hatred in her heart and raises an army. Miraculously, Theron's empire begins to fall apart as her sister goes on from one victory to another.The sister raises an army of children where they are told to be devoid of love and have a sense of duty to the kingdom coming first in all matters of life.Naturally, two youngsters there grow up and find love only to be punished by the evil queen.It's a good thing that Snow White, whose kingdom is under attack, does not appear in this rather icy film."
" B o r i n g !
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,1,"Budget $115M. Total Gross $48M! Nuff said. A $67M loss. The people have spoken. If a movie breaks even it is probably a 5. If it loses $67M or 58% of the budget then it must be a 1. No one wanted to pay to see this movie. So, anyone who claims that this movie is worth watching is in direct conflict with public opinion.Slow moving. I've never seen a bad Hemsworth movie until tonight. Terrible!No redeeming qualities whatsoever. The director is to blame, not the actors. I want two hours of my life back.Don't waste your time"
" Barely worth watching but it has it's moments
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,3,"*** SOME SPOILERS*** There was a lot of potential that was overlooked during the pre-production of this movie that could have made this a solid entry in the Epic Fantasy genre, but it seems that the creators were more interested in getting the movie ""in the can"" and getting all the ""A"" list actors back to their other projects. The cinematography was barely adequate, and the color schemes that were chosen in the cgi enhancements as well as in the sets did a poor job of setting the scenes.The weaknesses in the visuals were added into by the so-so editing and the barely adequate direction, which succeeded in making many of the early scenes (Emily Blunt's story, for example) in having a lesser impact than it otherwise would have. Ravenna's opening scene with the chess game was also poorly done, as her opponent (a king, her current temporary husband) turned out to be a less than dignified and unworthy opponent not just in chess but in his kingdom role. The filmmakers missed a chance to build up Ravenna's gravitas a bit by making him a more interesting character, or at least, showing a more fitting death. I only share this as an example of how the film took the road of mediocrity where it could have done much better.Emily Blunt does shine as the Ice Queen, granted, with a weak script, and with a thin plot, filled with holes and weaknesses (such as how easily she was allowed to leave her sister's side after the manifestation of her power; and how it was just too easy and quick for her to kill the father of her dead baby, and speaking of that, how easy it was for Ravenna (Charlize Theron) to have manipulated/magicked him into burning his own daughter alive when just that day he was willing to have run away with his beloved and his daughter; just stupidly unbelievable)The relationship between Eric and Sara was also filled with potential, but their bizarrely paced romance made little emotional sense, both positively and negatively throughout the film. Their fights (mostly her coldness) and their warmth (mostly from Eric's side) did not always make sense with how human emotions work.Speaking of acting, with the exception of Emily Blunt, there was not a lot of range or depth in the characters or the actor's performances, and coupled with mediocre direction, mediocre editing, and a weak script (plot, characters, setting, just about everything) I don't blame the cast too much.The way the allegiances change back and forth throughout the film are rather abrupt, and along with that, the action scenes are mostly forgettable, such as the battle with the Goblins, which is too ridiculous to describe. Apparently they barely survive a single battle with one goblin, but then Eric survives an onslaught from an entire cadre of them with the help of Sara's single well-placed fire arrow which burns an entire group of them up, which scares all of the rest of them away.The whole military/political setup of the warring kingdoms are not properly portrayed and the character of Snow White, who is a queen during part of the film is only shown from behind, and also seems to fail to protect the mirror properly, and we are also not given adequate explanation as to the plan that was in place to put it in a place of safety.All in all, though I could go on, I would not bother paying a dime to see this movie, and if you liked the previous Snow White film, and you can see this on HBO for free, or can get the DVD from Netflix, it might be OK to put on while you are running a treadmill or folding the laundry, but otherwise it was a disappointing waste of time, sadly, though it could have been a solid fantasy movie with some more attention paid to detail. Unfortunately, the flaws of them film (except for the lead cast members) pervade the whole movie and poison the whole thing top to bottom.3 out of 10 stars"
" he Huntsman :Winter's War has good visuals but a huge disappointment even with its stellar cast.Entirely misused opportunity.
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,5,"The Huntsman: Winter's War (2016): Snow White and The Huntsman is one of the worse adaptation of classic fairy tale with bad cast of Kristen Stewart as Snow White.That movie is entire rubbish except good visuals and striking performance of Charlize Theron as Ravenna,the evil queen.But who would expect as sequel for that film.But surprisingly they made it and expectations were raised with entry of Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain.Forget Chris Hemsworth..I expected a lot from the trio female superstars of Hollywood.But unfortunately it didn't happen..:-(Plot:Frozen with evil touch + Huntsman=Huntsman Winter's War.Plus Points:1)VFX: This movie has brilliant visuals and sets.Now a days even a B grade Hollywood movie are having decent visuals.So nothing special when compared to Huntsman's huge budget.2)Casting: Well I am informing that this only helped to raise expectations.Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain,both really made me to watch this movie and don't forget the star of the movie Charlize Theron.Even though this movie has limited screen presence of her,she dominated the screen.Minus Points:1)Story and Screenplay: Well this movie may be liked by kids but to adults,its just so cliché ridden fairy tale with entirely unused potential of great actors.So,The Huntsman :Winter's War has good visuals but a huge disappointment even with its stellar cast.Entirely misused opportunity.My rating 5.5/10"
" Like watching milk mold
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,2,"It's astounding how bad ""Huntsman: Winter's War"" is. From the preposterous title (it would appear that the story occurs in springtime, and that the one battle in the film is a tiny 10-person battle in a throne room) to the absolute lack of reason, sense, or skill, this coldly-received sequel to an already flawed film (Snow White & the Huntsman) is like finding a diamond in the rough in terms of bad movies. In a way it's almost good how bad it is. Almost.The movie is narrated by Liam Neeson with empty phrases like ""lands to the North"" and ""the Good Queen built a fortress around her heart."" We meet the Evil Queen from the first movie (the absurdly over-the-top Charlize Theron who is the only fun role in the film) and her sister, Elsa -- I mean Freya, a woman who's heart was broken and uses her ice powers to turn her hair white, adopt an icy wardrobe, and reign in an ice castle on top of a mountain. Her ultimate character arc is the discovery that love can ultimately be a good thing. She didn't even have to sing ""Let It Go"" to figure it out.Simultaneously we have a remake of ""Braveheart"" occurring, as we meet the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth reprising his titular role) and his love affair with fellow huntswoman, Sara (with an off-again on-again Scottish accent). Declaring their love for one another in a forbidden encounter, the Huntsman all but states that he ""wants to raise crops and God- willing a family"" with his new lover. A stroke of misfortune leads him to believe Sara is brutally murdered, and thus the war is launched. I mean the battle that takes place in the last 3 minutes of the movie.In reality, the plot seems to be about the group of heroes (the Huntsman, some of the dwarfs from the first film (whoever wanted to come back, I guess), and some other female dwarfs) on the hunt for the Magic Mirror, hoping to find it before Evil Queen Freya reclaims it for herself. Like the ruby slippers, it's said to have dangerous powers, but I am sure as hell unaware of what those powers could be (aside from being able to judge the hotness level of women like a caddy bitch). Why this is so important is never explained, nor are any of the plot details seemingly relevant at any one point. The story is vapid, lifeless, thrown together. As I was watching this film, things kept happening, but overall nothing was occurring. I began to doubt the reasoning for this movie's existence other than an attempts for a cash grab (the original made over $400 million in sales... This one barely made $160 million against a budget of $115 million. Ouch).If you need an example of what is wrong with the Hollywood system right now, then ""Huntsman"" seems to be a textbook example. From the overly-choreographed fight scenes, Lord of the Ring's-inspired mythology (which seems to be the standard for fantasy films nowadays), and the rehashing of characters both living and dead with no regard to story (how many times can Charlize Theron come back to life without absolutely flushing brain power down the toilet?), the film churns along from one predictable beat to the next, and by the time it ends it's hard to remember that there are actually decent movies made anymore. To watch ""Huntsman: Winter's War"" is to lobotomize a part of your brain. Movies can be art, and they can be moving, and they can be thrilling. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of expired milk."
" Huntsman Begins
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"Although that's only partly true. While we do get a Backstory for the Huntsman (and other characters), we also get a sequel to the previous movie (Huntsman and Snow White that is). Snow White is absent in this though (apart from one quick scene), so don't expect to see Kristen Stewart in this.Whether this had anything to do with her shenanigans with the director of the first movie or any money/salary issues, or just wanting to get away and tell something different, is something I can't tell you. But I can tell you, that if you liked the first one, because of the fantasy part it had and generally are into those kind of movies, this will be a movie you have to watch too."
" Frozen Assets
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"Talented and charismatic stars turn what is a special effects dumpster fire into a somewhat entertaining special effects dumpster fire. The Huntsman: Winter's War is both a prequel and a sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman and in the very least is not burdened with that film's ridiculous premise that Kristen Stewart is more ""fair"" than Charlize Theron. (Not to mention the even more ridiculous theory that Kristen Stewart is Snow White. Unless giving the director's wife a poison apple counts but I might me mixing up my characters.)Unfortunately, despite this leg up, the sequel fails in the story department. The plot is the not Snow White but a live action version of Frozen. I know that sounds pretty cool. So how does one start such a film? A musical number? A colorful recap of the first film showing what its characters are up to now? Does somebody build a snowman? If you're a screenwriter you, of course, start with a brutal remake of the opening act of Conan the Barbarian. And of course, make sure you have plenty of voice over narration. People love when someone simply tells them a story rather than show it with the action on screen. (Yes, I know the Original Conan the Barbarian had plenty of voice over narration. In all fairness, though, it starred early 80's Arnie who spoke like a dozen words of English)This is the second film I have seen this week that glorifies child soldiers (the first was an even worse 5th Wave), whom barely make sense when you have machine guns and suicide bombs but make zero sense when the swords weigh more than they do.The Huntsman: Winter's War also continues the somewhat disturbing trend of having regular size actors play dwarfs. Which has always struck me as some weird digital blackface preventing actual dwarfs from being hired?All this aside it is certainly worth the watch for the actors on display. Jessica Chastain is stunning, Charlize Theron is still the fairest of them all and Chris Hemsworth brings his goofy broad charm that a movie about child slavery so desperately needs.The actors, costumes, sets and most of the special effects guys are absolved of all their sins. The director, however, deserves an eternity of building a snowman and screenwriter needs To be crushed, driven before us all to a soundtrack of the lamentations of his women."
" Frozen stiff
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,3,"The Huntsman is a confusing, dull, flat film which obviously tries to emulate Frozen but comes across as a mess.We have Ravanna (Charlize Theron) and her sister Freya the Ice Queen (Emily Blunt) who is betrayed by Ravenna as she had Freya's baby killed as she would grow up to be the fairest of them all.Freya's heart goes cold and she uses children to train in her army including the Eric the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) who grows up to fall in love with Sara (Jessica Chastain) but love is forbidden in the kingdom of the Ice Queen and tragedy befalls. Some years later the Huntsman has to retrieve the magic mirror with the help of some dwarfs but Freya is also on the scent.The comedy is unfunny, the action is mundane but at least the special effects are good but this is a poorly realised movie and an unnecessary follow up to the Snow White film."
" Not Worse than The First movie
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,5,"Now we have the huntsman without snow white. A story that was so made up to allow them to make a new movie whatever matters. The story begins with snow white's army transporting modest's mirror to a safe place then we know about the hunts man past and his old love Sarah and how the Queen Freya separated them from each other, then the story continues with them trying to get the mirror back after Freya had captured it.I was so bored and annoyed by the childish moment of the hunts man dying which were a lot and so faked and expected, how the hero dies in the middle of the movie for god sake!! I blame all of that on the movie director and writer.Beyond that the movie wasn't bad, a nice movie to watch on your extra free time to enjoy some fantasy.My rating is 6/10"
