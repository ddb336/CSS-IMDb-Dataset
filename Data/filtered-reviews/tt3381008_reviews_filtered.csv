" Good times
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,Hilarious. I didn't know what to expect. But a great comedy ride.
" JUST SO WRONG BUT SO RIGHT
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,8,I haven't laughed this hard in ages. It is mind boggling that this script was thought up in the first place. Comedy is subjective and i do not think American audiences will get it. Just superbly outrageous.
" No doubt.... This movie is insanely funny..
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,10,This is the most funnies movie I've ever seen..... 11/10
" Cheap but hilarious
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,7,"If you want a short film that will no doubt make you laugh, this is for you."
" Hardcore comedy for adults.
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,8,"This film is nuts. It's so hardcore, perverted and sick that I would not recommend it to most people. But the ones who love hardcore perverted films once in a while will have a treat with this one."
" funniest
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,8,One of the movies that makes me laugh a lot without stopping
" Tremendous comedy
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,Never laughed so much for any movie.Please enjoy it with your friends not family.
" Fun
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,10,"A great and funny comedy
Fantastic characters
Unique actings and good stories
Fantastic and valuable to see"
" I laughed my head off from start to finish..!!
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,10,"Sascha Baron Cohen's comedy genius serves well to truly take the piss out of Britain's welfare class and football fanatics, in this hilarious comedy..!! Tonnes of really inappropriate humour, the likes of which I have never seen before, which left me in fits of laughter throughout the film. Fast paced action from start to finish, with a few warm and fuzzy moments thrown into the storyline too. Thoroughly entertaining..!!! ðŸ¤£"
" Hilarious, utterly hilarious
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,10,"Its hard to recommend this film enough.Its non stop laughs. The plot is unimportant but is simple and effective.The jokes are phenomenal.It finds original comedy scenes based around the ridiculousness of the characters.Wonderful,."
" Great laugh ðŸ˜†
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,10,"The whole family was just laughing ðŸ˜†
Talk about stomach cramps lol"
" +/-
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,8,"+: some outrageously funny scenes, very slick action scenes, very entertaining, fresh take on James Bond plus Bromance story, actually had a message at the end
-: some humor may be considered too crude, silly story, some non-sequiturs within the movie's own logic"
" It's just a bit of crass humor at most.
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,7,Everything you expect from a scripted Sacha baron Cohen Movie.It pushes the envelope regarding physically repellent humor (I am leaving that a surprise) and of course a sentimental plot and cultural stereotypes abound.It's agreeable viewing when you want something gross and kind of silly and the acting talent of course really bring it. Cohen's lovable scrounger playing off the veritable tough guy whose name I don't remember.
" Great Film
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,"In short, Grimsby is a film that you'll find hilarious if that's your style of comedy. If you love Sacha Baron Cohen's style of comedy, this will be an easy 10/10, if seen this film about 10(ish) times now, and it still gets me. But it's not everyone's cup of tea, and I've noticed it's not the comedy Americans enjoy, but we New Zealanders, Australians, and Brits tend to enjoy this style of comedy, if an extreme comedy fan that is."
" There was a reason this was a box office failure
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,2,Sophomoric gross out comedy. You will laugh a bit but it will not be worth your time..
" Horrible
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,1,Every copy of this trash should be sought out and destroyed.
" A New Low...
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,1,"I have no idea how Mark Strong's agent talked him into doing this **** pie of a movie...Utterly juvenile, tasteless, crude, a worthless pile of steaming crap. I never liked SBC anyway but there was really no attempt at humor here, just a display of horrifying shock scenes.There's no doubt a lot of money was put into the production values, sets and effects, which makes me wonder even more how this atrocity got made in the first place.If you want to know just how depraved Hollyweird is these days, give this a look. Don't say I didn't warn ya..."
" A rather sloppy effort
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,5,"The extreme vulgarity and highly predictable gags mask the fact that this is actually a very slick production with surprisingly impressive effects and editing. As far as comedy goes this is some of Baron Cohen's weaker work, despite some good moments. It's a shame more work wasn't put into the scrips and make-up as there is potential for a great movie here, particularly with Mark Strong's perfectly frustrated straight-man act."
" Could Be Better... And May Be More Cringe-worthy Than Humorous.
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,5,"My Ratings:
Story 1.00 : Direction 1.25 : Pace 1.25 : Acting 1.25 : Entertainment 1.00
Total 5.75 out of 10.00 (rated as 5 on IMDb because I just couldn't give it a 6).So if you like puerile toilet and drug humour, then this is for you. The trouble is, the swearing and immature humour gets tired quick. By the time I was a quarter way through, my interest was waiving. And that is the trouble with this film. Though it's well filmed and has a decent thriller storyline, it's still a one-trick pony or should I say elephant (?)I really hate when writers only have one point of view and they stick rigidly to it. Here, it's the city of Grimsby and its population, who the writers think are nothing more than drugged up thugs and paedophiles living for sex, and to have as many kids as they can so the benefit pays for their life and fixes. But hey, that's riotously hilarious, isn't it (?) Actually, no, it's not. It's a stupid, sad, and a stereotypical point of view. But at least the writers can say they are being satirical with their topical and observational comedy.So what do you get between the fatuousness? Well, you get a decent story of a secret agent out to save the world. Sebastian Graves is following information that will lead him, not only back to his long-lost brother, but to a clever and controversial plot to save the world... but cull the human race.Director Louis Leterrier is great at the action sequences as shown with the fantastic opening sequence. Brilliant, innovative and imaginative. He also thinks out all the details to their best effect. I see this in the sequence where Daniel Radcliffe gets infected with HIV... though Radcliffe didn't participate in the film's making. The shame is, Leterrier isn't too good with comedy and his timing can sometimes be off. The mating elephant sequence is the best example as it goes on too long, even though we all know what the inevitable climax will be.As for the acting, well, Mark Strong is... Mark Strong, which is great if you're a Mark Strong fan. I'm not. But Strong was a wise choice because this is a Sacha Baron Cohen film. Even though this is full of good and decent actors and actresses, they are not allowed to outshine the star. Rebel Wilson as Nobby's love interest Dawn and Penelope Cruz as the bad bird, Rhonda George are near nonexistent - the carnal pachyderms have more screen-time... well, at least parts of them, anyway. Even our more comedic actors, like Johnny Vegas and Ricky Tomlinson, are only there for packing. A waste of talent and opportunities.So, even though this film scores over mid-marks, I wouldn't recommend anybody to watch this movie; unless you're a Sacha Baron Cohen fan or like this infantile humour. If you're a filmmaker, looking to shoot an action film, then check this out. As I stated, there are some great action sequences. Otherwise, stay away.Shoot on over to my The Game Is Afoot and Just For Laughs lists to see where this picture rated.Take Care and Stay Well."
" Don't see that movie when you are eating something
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,6,"Don't see that movie when you are eating something. If you are eating something, you will squirt something out of your mouth."
" Too funny
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,7,If you love slapsticks movies then you are going to love it and if you don't like slapsticks zoner please don't watch. Mr Cohen is as funny as he is known to be.
" Funny as ****
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,8,"This is funny to watch. Gross but funny! probs best for the older generation to steer clear but if your into gross, stupid comedy then this is for you. Worth the watch"
" Yes very stupid and very funny.
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,8,"I like Sacha Baron Cohen's work in general and this is still keeping up the standard set by Ali G all those years ago. Amazed who he got to star in this, like Penelope Cruz! Very silly but not a bad spy spoof and the ludicrous actions scenes aren't vastly more so than what Hollywood dishes up these days."
" very entertaining film,,,good job mr sacha
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,8,"When i saw borat ,,i just think that mr sacha is true comedian although that is scene make me pukee ,,but its alright ,,then this film ,,yes it got it too ,,with his raw comedy is very entertaining,,good job mrsacha"
" Best Movie Ever!! Sacha rules!!
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,10,If you like movies where you need to leave your brain at home and have pure raw entertainment..this is the one..Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Strong ensured there was no dull moment at all in the movie..The story writers deserve an Oscar for thinking bizarre and out of the box...Too much fun!
" Pushing the boundaries into filth
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,1,"Many people seem to praise this film for its comedy style citing as it pushes the boundaries and has no limits. However, although this film does go quite far into offensive and filth territory, nothing about it comes off as funny.Shock value comedy can be good when done well, such as Sachs Baron Cohen's highly praised film Borat, but here in the Brothers Grimsby everything feels completely forced, comes off as try-hard and is quite boring.The plot is thin and predictable. They also try giving the film a more sad and sentimental feel with its constant flashbacks of the brothers as children and them having a sad backstory. Even with a run time of only 83 minutes, the film feels longer.The gags as mentioned before such as an elephant scene, and the sucking of some substance out of their private go on quite long and the longer it lasts, the less funny and more cringe it becomes. The overall English accents and tone of the film is a turn off. Perhaps most of the praise comes from people from England or the United Kingdom who relates more to the humor.Overall simply because a film is overly raunchy and pushes the boundaries doesn't mean it is funny or great. Adding in, it is no surprise as to why this film was a box office flop, and it seems relatively forgotten today- which is for the best. One of the worst and unfunny comedies having seen. Would not recommend."
" Pure mindless comedy
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,7,"I have very little idea why, but I shamelessly enjoyed 'Grimsby'.This has all the makings of an absolutely terrible film, mainly due to the ridiculous tonne of toilet and sex humour. Yet somehow I actually had a fun time watching it, which is extremely surprising given the aforementioned.I can't even put into words why I like this, but I simply do. It's pure mindless comedy, one not to put any thought into whatsoever. I think what helps is the cast, as the likes of Sacha Baron Cohen, Mark Strong and PenÃ©lope Cruz are good actors who make it watchable.I will say, however, it is quite UK-centric. I assume most (not all) international viewers won't get it at all, which I can understand."
" what a load of rubbish - avoid
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,1,"No wonder the people from grimsby were so offended! The acting was ok but the jokes mainly terrible, aside from half a dozen corkers the rest were predictable and rubbish. The scene where someone throws a dog out of the window is disgusting even if that dog survived. The accents were an awful mix of mancunian and Yorkshire and aside from the one pub I don't believe anything else was shot there. Some of the script was just offensive. The kids parts were great so they're safe and the last 5 minutes were funny ish. How they ever got some of the cast they did I'll never know. Save yourself and the time watching this movie and pull your toenails out. It will be less painful."
" One of the most entertaining movie I have watched recently.
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,10,"I almost laughed every 10 minutes. I should say that, this movie contains a lot of british sense of humour. if you are familiar with English life style, this movie will make you laugh a lot in my opinion."
" How the hell did they know????
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,10,"Look, I'm not a humour snob. I find one of the funniest things in the world is the person getting biffed with a frying pan gag a' la Bottom, Reeves & Mortimer, What Lies Beneath (yeah alright it wasn't comedy in that last one but I still laughed, that is the power of the pan)
So take that on board when I say I haven't laughed quite so much at a film as I laughed at this one for years!
The plot though! This film is a few years old but you get to the last half hour of the film and think ""oh my bloody god! That is bloody spooky!""
Makes you think. ðŸ¤”"
" Puerile Rubbish
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,4,"Quite a few well known faces in this absolutely dreadful rubbish. The jokes are puerile and unsubtle, obvious and crude.Few redeeming features and those that appeared in it will want it scrubbing off their film CVs pronto.Awful from start to finish. I'm being very generous to give it 4/10Not quite sure why."
" Conditional Funny
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,5,"I did like the little puns, the main character does, but it also has some ugly gags with elephant sperm and some scrotch jokes. so I'm a little divided into two mind by this movie. I had some laughs and some wannabe laughs. It's nice, if you can cope with some real crude scenes. But if you have the opporunity to watch a real good comedy instead, take the real good comedy."
" Ive seen worse Brit Coms
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Its not the best Sasha film by a long chalk and i doubt that it will translate over the pond or Channel very well, but it as its moments, shame that they seem to be repetitive in one form or another.Rebel Wilson always adds on a point to any film hence why this 5 became a 6 for me.Some funny moments, some flat moments but i suppose it depends on how easy you are entertained. Got a feeling East Yorkshire / Humbersiders might score it higher."
" Very stupid
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,6,Very stupid and had some over the top laughs and some that even made you look away.
" Ali g is head actor and makes film big with great kingsman actor
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,9,Well funny action film America could not make. But did make trump and shame was not harmed in making of this film.Has a few great comedy actorsBut like a team will not be a second film but British are beter at second good film so ali g will make second may be.Leam Neeson will not be in a team again cus great team.Worth a watch but may be like carry on film for American person
" Sides-splitting humour
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,9,"Brilliant movie - it made my sides split. As long as you embrace the silliness, you'll love it."
" Garbage
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,1,"I'm a big fan of Mark Strong, he's a brilliant actor and I usually watch something with his name in the credits, which is why I stumbled into this nonsense. If you haven't already wasted away some of your life to the tune of whatever the run time is on this, just don't.
I can only assume Mr. Strong owed someone a huge favour, or simply lost a bet and the forfeit was to appear in this.
It's so bad, it's actually painful to watch."
" So bad but so funny
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,7,The headline says it all really. I put it on out of boredom not expecting much. Nothing could have prepared me for the madness that followed. It started to make me laugh straight away and I never stopped until the end credits and then I laughed some more.The film itself is puerile and nonsensical but it's about two brothers that are a secret agent and an unemployed waste of space respectively so you have to suspend your disbelief and just go with it.
" A new kinda comedic type
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Unless the stinking scenes , i think it'll be one of the best movies i watched this year"
" You'll laugh for sure
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,9,"If you haven't laughed out loud it in a while, this movie won't disappoint you.
But then it also depends on your taste of humor. If you have already watched the Dictator or Borat then you know what you are going in to. To let you know if you haven't, it contains mostly explicit humor."
" How anyone funds this funny
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,1,Cowen is not funny and this movie is a mess worst movie of 2016 how he things any of his movies r good is a joke
" Disgustingly funny
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,9,How far can Sacha push the envelope of what is acceptable? Surely this movie is at his limit. I think not. I love this guys humour but found myself many times saying WTF? Then a brilliant performance in The Spy movie. Not a 1 act wonder this talented man
" Pleasant surprise
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,10,"Never heard of it before. But i love it. Crazy, vital, fun, dirty as hell, high tempo, baron cohen and mark strong is a great duo."
" Absolutely fockin brilliant
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,10,I literally have sore cheeks from laughing so hard (too many puns in this review). Awesome movie!
" funny for all the wrong reasons
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,4,"Although this is the second time I've seen this it still had me belly laughing all the way through, some proper funny moments that in pure Sacha Baron Cohen style pushes the mark to the point of wrongness.Away from the comedy this film has some great action scenes that wouldn't look out of place in a Bond movie, I was impressed with the Point Of View shots."
" So funny!!!!
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,10,"If you have a dirty mind go watch this you'll find it hilarious, if you don't, don't watch it :)"
" A low level of toilet humour
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,3,"This film is very funny in places. However, elsewhere, it descends to the lowest form of toilet humour imaginable. The goal seems to be to make anyone with any sense of decency squirm with unease. Maybe they ran out of proper gags. If you enjoy this sort of thing, this film is for you. If you have any taste, stay well away."
" Utter Filth
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,1,"Terrible movie, with no funny moments unless you are 3, which you wouldn't be since this movie is rated R or whatever. How this even got made astounds me. I laughed, maybe MAYBE once. I wish I could erase this movie from my brain."
" Funniest Movie ever!!!
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,10,I don't know who gave this movie 6.xx but it was the Funniest Movie I've ever seen!! 11/10!!!
" Rude......Crude...... Lewd........ and Absolutely Hilarious
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,8,"Maybe I have a twisted sense of humor, but this movie left me with tears of laughter. If you like Cohen's particular brand of humor, then you'll love this movie. I laughed at his previous outings, especially Borat and Bruno, but this one had me rolling. If you're a fan, don't miss it."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,8,"I loved this movie. very different in many ways and at the same time very similar in many ways. this movie is more than a straight comedy. It's about half comedy and the other half is an action movie and a strong emotional story. overall I can't say it's a good story because it definitely has lots of dumb-ness and dopey-ness, and stuff that would never happen. but there were definitely parts that were emotionally powerful. And the action really threw me off guard. Some of it was ok, but most of it was BEASTLY. And back to the comedy, it was hilarious. plenty of scenes had me dying of laughter. overall it wasn't nearly as funny as Borat, but that's because Borat was a straight comedy for the entire movie.sacha baron Cohen continues to prove he is a GENIUS. this is another great character, and completely different from his past five (Ali g, Borat, bruno, Jean girard, aladeen). he's never afraid to take it too far and shock you. also, a lot of the comedy isn't just random, it frequently relates back to something in a clever way (3 viewings)"
" Hilarious
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,7,"Pretty damn funny. Lined with moments of comedic gold that made me laugh out loud, love humour when its well timed. A few over the top moments such as the elephant scene which could have been left out. Still not too bad and quite a neat little gem. Definitely not an Oscar contender but a good laugh in the end. A lot of comedies try too hard, this was a much better effort. 7/10"
" Very crude, but Very Funny
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,6,"I went to watch this as it featured Mark Strong, Rebel Wilson and Ian McShane. If you are easily offended don't even think about it. However, it was also really funny so I found myself laughing and they do say laughter is the best medicine. If you can overlook the really crude bits, it is hilarious."
" Hilarious
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,7,"Typical Sacha Baron Cohen project - you either like it, find it funny OR hate it, feel disgusted. I fall into former category. Can't watch it with family though. And Mark Strong being there helped too."
" Hilarious stuff
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,10,"This is hilarious. Just don't watch it with your family. Fast paced, extremely crude but very funny."
" Perfect for People with ADHD
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,7,The pacing of this movie is insanely fast paced and it's extremely hilarious. Don't take it seriously at all and you'll have a great time.
" Not Sacha's best
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,5,"When I found out Sacha Baron Cohen had a spy spoof film i immediately had to watch it. I can say this is not a boring movie, but that gets out of its way many times just for a joke, making it feeling forced and sometimes purposeless, slowing the pace of the movie. There's a strange Deus ex Machina by the climax, when one of the kids just happens to be standing in front of the evil woman and hits her. I get it, it's a parody, but there are still some rules they cannot skip if they want the story to feel at least a little satisfactory. In the end, the film is fun at some parts, but the jokes take away from the movie more than what they bring."
" Silly comedy
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,A good comedy to watch at the end of the night. Some not-so-funny jokes like that. Sacha Baron Cohen makes a kind of suburban English caricat football supporter. It's worth it if you want to watch something silly and light.
" there are a lot of laughing points.
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,7,"Brain holes are wide open and dirty to a certain extent, but there are a lot of laughing points."
" First you'll rub your eyes, then you'll need to wash them
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,5,"An elephantine (get it?) exercise in shock comedy: offensive, disgusting, lower-than-low, but frenetic and not boring at the very least. There is a breathtaking first-person POV action sequence at the start, and you will laugh at certain times, but you'll probably be too ashamed to recommend the picture to anyone. Most unrealistic thing about it: England reaching the final of, let alone winning, the World Cup in football. LoL. ** out of 4."
" Not what i expected
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,1,"Used to like this kind of movies, it looks i do not anymore."
" Absolutely Entertaining!!!
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,10,"Don't listen to the negative reviews because it's wrong and I enjoyed the movie and I laughed so hard watching this incredible film. You will have a big laughs trust me, Even the story was great and also there is a drama and action beside the comedy."
" Enjoyed all the way through.
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,10,"I couldn't believe the ratings for this are so low, the movie hooked me up right from the start,was laughing all the way through.
Dont watch it with minors though,haha.
The acting is good for a comedy,and the jokes are unique and I might say original at points.
The plot is entertaining,you get sucked in laughing that you don't care about it being silly,or somewhat predictable.
This comedy movie kept me laughing all way through,and thats why I think it deserves a 10.
I hope sasha will continue to play this kind of movies.cant get enough of his humor."
" Subjective
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,8,I don't know for real if that film was really good comedy or I just love that actor but I liked it.
" A low-ranked copy of Kingsman 1 (the security service)
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,4,"I watch this movie suggested by one of my friends but it was such a disapointment to me.
It was a really bad copy of Kingsman 1 (the security service) it has some funny parts but most them were disgusting rather than funny.WASTING OF TIME AND INTERNET FOR DOWNLOADING THIS MOVIE"
" Hilarious
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,10,I have never laughed so loud in my life. This movie is hilarious and I recommend it.......but watch it without your parents. The 2 lead actors were perfectly cast. Sacha is a genius and Mark is not left behind either. 10/10
" Hilarious
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,10,It's the first time I've laughed so hard. Sacha is a genius and Mark Strong......what an actor. I recommend this movie.......but don't watch it with your family.
" Comedy that was too heavy-handed for my liking
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,4,"Oh dear, given Baron-Cohen's previous work, I thought there might be more of a subtle parody element within this - I was wrong.Coarse, crude and heavy-handed comedic double-entendres - they didn't work very often here. 4 / 10 for trying, some of which was my patience.."
" It's starts OK, then loses steam
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,6,"It doesn't totally collapse by the end, which is nice. Still, it does leave you with the impression that it could have been much more. Actually, the middle is the worst. It's not very funny or fun, some gags are pretty much just grose, not even interesting. One of the main problems is that the main villain, Penelope Cruz, while superbly cast (""she looks pretty and sweet, but she's just the worst""), isn't properly introduced or followed through. She also doesn't do a very good job, but, given what she had to work with, one can't really blame her.On the missed opportunities, at the very least it could have had more fun on the expense of the terrible ""Fast&Furious"" franchise. Ditto for ""Harry Potter"". What they did barely scratched the surface of what one could (should?) do. While poking fun on James Bond is nothing new, still, they could have done more on that front, too. One impersonation of Sean Connery's accent isn't enough.Story is significantly better than other Sasha Baron Cohen comedies, but, still, way too simplistic and naÃ¯ve to be anything more than a framing device for the gags.There quite a few good jokes and gags, there's a good cameo by Annabelle Wallis, so, the whole thing is watchable, if you like Sasha Baron Cohen comedies. Otherwise, it's best you find some other spy-spoof comedy."
" Hi-la-rious
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,7,"Cohen and Wilson at their finest. I mean.... they are definitely C-R-A-Z-Y. Crazier they could get dangerous. Of course this Sacha Baron Cohen movie is a 1st (very very very 1st) degree humor bunch of skits. Of course a few scenes ain't funny. Of course, it's gross. Of course it's ridiculous. Of course it's pathetic. So you better watch this outrageous movie with the eyes of a child or .... Or you'll be missing the point. Trust me rolling on the floor laughing is really harmful to health.

" Best comedy movie i've ever seen. Laughed so hard!
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,10,"And i thought nothing could ever top ""40 year old Virgin""! Watched this 3 times!"
" Funny and enjoyable but...
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,4,"Since it's a comedy movie, it's undoubtedly a funny and enjoyable movie. But there are some nasty and tasteless scenes. I rated this movie 4/10 because those nasty scenes exceed the enjoyable parts."
" Non-stop gags...
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,6,"Normally I am not overly keen on the movies that Sacha Baron Cohen stars in, because he is fairly singular and monotonous in his movies. As in if you've seen one of his movies, you have essentially seen all.However I decided to give the movie a chance because it had Mark Strong on the cast list, and also because my wife said it was a hilarious movie. It turned out that this was actually a rather enjoyable and funny movie. There were some really funny moments throughout the course of the movie. And yes, I did laugh a lot throughout this movie as the endless gags kept coming.The storyline was a good combination of serious plot and silly comedy. And I must admit that this was one of Sascha Baron Cohen's better movies actually.The Brothers Grimsby"" is good for an evening of cheap laughs, but I doubt this is a movie that you will pick up and watch more than once as it doesn't seem to have enough contents to support more than a single viewing."
" Not funny, just gross!
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,3,"SPOILER ALERT!!!Sucking out deadly venom from your brother's testicles - check! Sticking a rocket up your butt to prevent an explosion - check! Make an elefant ""cum"" while you are inside a female elephants womb...*sigh* - double check! Does that sound funny to you? Neither to me! The list goes on, I rather not go into more detail.Story
Low life English scum Nobby finally meets his brother after they were split as kids from a foster home 25 years ago just to find out he is working as a deadly spy now. Chaos follows as usual and both have to stick together to find the bad guys and save the world. Here some points to consider.Positive
I laughed twice the entire movie. The running gag with Nobby smoking a cigarette after a each shameful event was pretty decent. And the time when he shot the bird (that came out of nowhere :)The action scenes were well done.The flashbacks were the most interesting part giving the story some emotional background.I was amazed how Mark Strong was still giving his A-game during all the embarrassing and gross scenes. I remember Ryan Philippe from MacKruger putting a parsley up his butt to distract some guards. That was just painful to watch and probably hurtful for his career. While Philippe seemed out of place for such toilet humor and looked very uncomfortable, Strong somehow is just going for it and gives his best in every scene. Kudos to him. (please don't ever do that again though!)Negative
As mentioned above, I only laughed twice. That is not nearly enough for a comedy of that caliber.Certain scenes were unnecessarily dragged on (Nobby confuse the hot girl with the cleaning lady or the whole ""toilet"" conversation following right after)The poorly over the top Ace Ventura rip-off with the elephant was simply not funny. It was cringe-worthy weird and embarrassing to watch.Penelope Cruz gets an extra negative point for not learning from previous mistakes. Saw her last in Zoolander 2 and now this? Not acceptable.Fazit (3/10)
You need to like gross-out humor to enjoy this movie otherwise it will be a painful experience. If you are not familiar with seeing a guys chunk or closeup of buttholes and pubic hair of an overweight woman (I cant believe the vocabulary I have to use for this review), then better avoid this flick at all cost. I like Cohen, he can be funny but this was a swing and a miss. Sorry Nobby!"

" My retinas have died...huh!
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Three minutes in, I didn't want to keep watching it but after ten minutes, I was committed to the end. I didn't want to like it but ...........I don't know what to say! Once you see some of these scenes you can't unsee them. Disgusting! ... but ... laugh out loud funny and most definitely, sickly original. Well done, I think!"
" Better than I expected
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,8,"I didn't expect much from this film, but was bored and had nothing better to do. I was pleasantly surprised that it was genuinely funny.
Sasha Baron Cohen is doing his usual thing of donning a silly accent and being an over-the-top caricature, but he was nicely balanced by a good script and Mark Strong, plus some side characters who were pretty good.
Some of the jokes didn't land, but overall better than I thought."
" Fantastic
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,10,Everyone needs to laugh and this movie is hilarious!
" Sardonic witticisms, vulgar one-liners, and some scenes that go on too long.
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,6,"I wanted to like this movie more than it actually turned out I did. Not by much, mind you, it scarcely looked like Oscar material to start with. But a couple of the jokes went past the point of humorous implications that made me laugh to the point of crass displays that made me cringe. 
Despite this, however, I found myself laughing heartily more often than not, particularly at the shock/slapstick gags which proliferate throughout the movie. I wasn't quite laughing to the point of tears, but I did become self conscious of the neighbors on account of how much noise I made on more than one occasion. 
I was surprised to see some of the celebrity clout cast in this comedy, but not unpleasantly so. Mark Strong shines, in particular, when you think of how many ""better"" scripts were likely on his radar when he chose to do this. He never seems to be phoning it in, even though this is a movie where he could easily get away with it. Cohen, the master of ethnic ambiguity, is his usual chameleon-goofball, this time as a football hooligan, to hilarious effect. 
This comes recommended for the not-easily-offended, but it wasn't one you need to see on the big screen."
" Funny times a million. End of. Ignore the haters. They don't know how to laugh.
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,9,"I freaking loved this film. You will also love it if you like laughing at very very stupid things. You will absolutely hate it if you are easily offended.It is best to not know anything about this film before you watch it so I won't include any spoilers. I knew nothing about it other than the fact that it was a Sasha Baron Cohen thing - the man can do no wrong in my eyes so I suppose I was an easy audience. I did wonder if quite a lot of the jokes would be missed by an American audience though, but the fab action scenes are universally awesome.If you have had a bad day then simply watch this film and laugh away your troubles."
" Marvelous

" Simultaneously great and gross
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,9,"This is a roller coaster of grotesque and bizarre humor that somehow manages to shoe horn in a touching, dramatic story about 2 brothers into it's otherwise ridiculous and twisted plot.One part action, one part drama and a heaping overdose of over the top gross out humor and what you end up with is an incredibly under rated and unexpected master piece.Of all Sasha Baron Cohen's films, this may be the most narrative and touching he's been able to achieve. While it's not quite the humor level of his earliest films like Borat, it contains more variety of elements than he's been able to achieve before this.You'll be cheering at the action, crying at the drama and if you can manage not to vomit, you'll be belly ache laughing at the humor.If you are sensitive to gross out humor, this might not be for you. But if you don't mind some cringe with your laughter, there's a lot to enjoy here."

" Not as bad as you've heard
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,7,"I recently watched an online survey video on Youtube about the stars who had - in their words - 'lost their shine.' I was surprised to see that Sacha Baron Cohen's name was on there, largely to do with 'The Brothers Grimsby' (or just 'Grimsby' in some cases). I saw the trailer in the cinema and it looked pretty funny (doesn't it always?), but couldn't see that it was destined to bomb.It's sort of a 'buddy-cop' film where a pair of mismatched individuals have to work together in order to solve X, Y or Z. In this case, we have a pair of mismatched spies - one (Baron Cohen) is a slob from Grimsby, while the other is his long lost younger brother who is now a genuine suave, super-spy (Mark Strong). Now, I'm a big fan of the pair of them and was looking forwards to seeing how they interact on the big screen, plus I own pretty much ever Sacha Baron Cohen film to date. However, now I've watched it, I can see why it didn't do him any favours.I'd say that the first third is probably the best section of the film. It is genuinely funny and there were a fair few 'laugh out loud' moments. It centres on the pair of brothers meeting and the set-up for their mission established. And, yes, Baron Cohen and Strong do play off each other well (in fact, I swear there are some shots which had to be cut short due to Mark Strong trying not to laugh at his co-star's antics!). The film feels like an extended episode of 'Shameless' (only with more stylised gunplay) and works best when it's actually set in Grimsby itself (although I do wonder what the real residents of Grimsby will make of the way they're being portrayed on screen!).Unfortunately, the action moves away from the titular town and begins to traverse the globe. This is where things start unravelling. There are still funny moments and many do land, however it's not half as slick as its opening. This wouldn't be too bad if it wasn't for the fact that the film includes between 1-3 (depending on your opinion) moments that are simply too over-the-top. I was happy to suspend my disbelief in order to make the plot/gags work, but sometimes things go too far - as if Baron Cohen is trying too hard to shock in order to get laughs. These bits stick out as annoying and just cringe-worthy in a film which is actually reasonably solid.I enjoyed the film, simply because more parts of it worked that didn't. However, as I mentioned, due to those few scenes which just stick in your mind for all the wrong reasons, I can see how it won't have helped Sacha baron Cohen's star remain sparkling."
" Shocking
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,3,"Sacha Baron Cohen's shtick has always been pushing the envelope and shock humour. He got everyone's attention with Borat. However, his successive attempts to do the same with Bruno and The Dictator showed that the gimmick was quickly wearing out. It could not be made any clearer with this film.So, the story. Nobby (Cohen) and Sebastian (Mark Strong) are estranged brothers having been separated after Sebastian gets adopted by an upper-middle class family, leaving Nobby to be brought up in the rough, working class environment of Grimsby.Twenty-eight years pass, and Sebastian has become a top-ranking MI6 assassin, while Nobby has raised a family with his girlfriend (Rebel Wilson). He's a gormless football hooligan, and a good friend of everyone in his chavvy neighbourhood. Nobby longs to be reunited with his brother, when he gets tipped off that Sebastian is in London trying to prevent an assassination attempt. Penelope Cruz is a humanitarian advocate hosting a philanthropic event in aid of a Middle Eastern boy with AIDS. Sebastian tries to complete his mission, but is distracted by Nobby, who finds him and embraces him, causing him to lose his aim, ruining the mission.Sebastian is then forced to go on the run as MI6 now believe him to be a traitor. Nobby agrees to help him fulfil his mission in clearing his name, and from there, it's really a below-the-belt juvenile spy film, with crude humour throughout.The jokes are fairly predictable, between Nobby's dysfunctional family to some of the grossest scenes Cohen has brought to the screen, and that's saying a lot. Let me put it this way, I'll never look at an elephant the same way again.The 'odd couple' dynamic has been done to death and there's no real surprises in this film. Some of the CGI is utterly atrocious. There's a scene that contains Donald Trump (well, actually, the photoshopped head of Donald Trump, and that's kind of my point) It was the tackiest bit of editing I've ever seen in a studio produced film.Cohen has tired out this shock humour technique in his work, and Grimsby is an uninspired spy comedy that shows us that he is in dire need of a new direction in his career."
" I tried not to find this funny, but I did.
",2018-01-24 00:00:00,8,"This film is puerile, childish, corny, yet I'm afraid to say it's also very funny.I can understand why some people hated it, but I guess a film where Sacha Baron Cohen lowers the bar for filth and infantile toilet humour to a new level is bound to get some negative reviews. I wish I didn't find it funny, but I couldn't help it, at the end of the day I'm still a big kid at heart and fireworks up arseholes or hiding in an elephant's vagina while being drowned in a mountain of spunk from a horny herd of elephants is funny. Not sure if many Americans would get the humour, but I'm sure a lot of Brits would find it hilarious. Certainly not a work of genius, just a crude and funny parody of spy movies and working class northern England.The coarseness of this film is relentless. Mark Strong plays along perfectly as the James Bond character who is reunited with his working class brother from Grimsby who eventually team up to save the world from being poisoned by a biological chemical weapon being released at the fictional Soccer World Cup final in Chile. If you are in the least bit prudish, you'd probably give it a 1/10, but if you like silly vulgar humour then give this film a go, it's not that long and is a good laugh."
" A real mixed bag
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,5,"GRIMSBY is a real mixed bag of a movie with some elements I loved and some I absolutely hated. That I liked anything about it at all is a surprise given that it was written by and stars Sacha Baron Cohen, an actor I find painfully unfunny and who tends to mar everything in which he appears. He tones it down a bit and even plays a mildly likeable character here, but he still can't resist throwing in lots of ridiculously crude humour which you'd expect in the playground; the poison scene and the elephant scene in particular are just stupid and crass and an example of everything I hate about modern comedy. It's a pity, as elsewhere this satirises working class life very well, with the depiction of Cohen's home life spot on. Elsewhere, the film's action elements are very good; I love Mark Strong and always thought he should have got the Bond job over Daniel Craig and he plays up to that persona here. There's some first person action courtesy of the HARDCORE HENRY director which is spot on, and even a Scott Adkins fight scene worth watching for alone. The rest is hit and miss, raising a smile here, repulsing the viewer at other times."
" ""Never, ever slag off a Grimsby lass.""
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,7,"I don't throw around the word ""genius,"" but unreservedly apply it to Sacha Baron Cohen as a comedian. He has me laughing too much to care if his humor is in poor taste or not. Though it is ultimately best that many people are put off by his humor, I regret that there will not be a sequel to this box office bomb. Grimsby, or as I prefer, The Brothers Grimsby reaches great heights of hilariousness without overstaying its welcome at 83 minutes. Furthermore, there is story enough to have me care for the main characters. I'd probably rate it an 8/10 if not for the overly frenetic action sequences. As for its dismal box office returns, it seems that too many Americans don't get the British and couldn't care less. It also seems that too many people failed to perceive a well-wrought story beyond the risquÃ© comedy. They went to the trouble of offering a dignified and reasonably coherent storyline, and like pearls before swine, people high-horsed it in response. Sheesh! I liked Borat, but consider this and the mockumentary BrÃ¼no to be Sacha Baron Cohen at his very best!"
" Uneven and then a killer
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,1,"There were a lot of funny moments, some great dialog, some well framed scenes. Then there were those moments which were really over the top ... obviously the elephant scene. However, what really ruined the entire movie for me was the disrespect shown for our President, Donald Trump. Hollywood just can't get over it. The actions of the extreme Hollywood left makes it less and less likely that I will spend a nickel on their products."
" Funny... Great... and Mark Strong is hot. Watch it!
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,7,"This is one of the funniest film I've seen this year. I like Mark Strong usually plays villian or sidekick role. It is great to see him in a comedy. The story is funny at all time and not a dull moment, I saw this film 3 times as I'm in love with Mark Strong, but also able to enjoy all the funny parts repeatedly. Definitely stands out among most of the mediocre films this year."
" mix bag of outrageous humor

His investigation leads to actress philanthropist Rhonda George (Penelope Cruz). Nobby's interference causes Sebastian to be blamed for an assassination. Sebastian is forced to team up with his secret brother Nobby.Nobby is partially annoying. Once I get over it, his idiocy is a little funny. It's all silly and outrageous. I'm half rolling my eyes, and half smirking in disbelief. I'm bored with the poop jokes and the more obvious stuff. The shock humor is over the top. On the other hand, SBC often hits the audience with some unexpected humor. It's a real mix bag."
" Over the top comedy with some fantastic scenes you have never seen before
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,9,"in fact one of the most hilarious comedy movies of the past decade. This was really funny, unlike 99% of all US so called comedies, which just aren't at all. Sacha kept the balance between Monty Python and Inspector Clouseau so well and also adds a tribute to all the regular scum people on this planet. This movie is fresh, over the top, political incorrect and full of offensive humor and has the balls to go right over the line, which most US comedies are not capable of crossing due to the unspoken censorship in Hollywood. Overall: fantastic comedy."

If you do not leave in the United Kingdom you might not get a bunch of references notably on the chav ""sub culture"" but in any case Sacha Baron Cohen will make you smile if you are not a hater of course."

",2017-09-22 00:00:00,10,"Another fantastic English comedy as Sacha Baron Cohen is at it again, with his funniest effort yet - actually beating Borat comfortably.Unfortunately, Americans - especially Donald Trump supporters - may well get lost in Grimsby's quick and clever one-liners, patois, and general humour.Hilarious? It's a must-watch for all Brit comedy fans!"
" The Funniest Movie I've seen in a while
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,9,"Sacha Baron Cohen really delivered in this movie. The man deserves an award for one of the funniest films I've seen in a while. The movie makes tons of jokes about Pop Culture references including Daniel Radcliffe,Donald Trump and much more! It is one of those films where it is best watched while no one is sleeping. I watched this film at 2 AM and found myself covering my mouth to stop me from laughing what felt like the loudest laugh ever. I believe that this film is Top 3 of Sacha Baron Cohen's works. Mark Strong is also excellent in this movie resulting in an amazing duo from the 2. I believe that this film is one of those that will easily make your top 5 funniest films.I rated this film 8/10 for the amazing humor and interesting story."

" The same plot as Unlocked but for sure more trashy (paytv)
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,7,"It's simple: it's again a spy against a treacherous leader who wants to teach a worldwide lesson and waits endlessly to trigger the annihilation during a sport event! So it's one thing or the other: either it's Unlocked that is so lazy in ideas that a big joke movie like Grimsby can find the same! Either the Grimbsy writers are really inspired to get the same ideas than Hollywood best??? Anyway this movie is more enjoyable because we know from start, it's for fun! Hilarious spy movies is a genre not that extinct (Austin Power, Johnny English) but this one would stay as the more dirty and sex oriented ever: The darts and elephants scenes are really funny and what about this final? The depiction of English working class families (fatty, full of rude kids, soccer and beer lover) makes laugh but it can also appear as a cynical treatment for the tastes of the privileged: that's the way they see us and this is so trash because they are so neat and the fun comes from the difference! Whatever it may be, I laughed and watching always serious Strong being pushed around was totally enjoyable as the smallest cameo PenÃ©lope ever did!"
" One of the best laughs this century.
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,9,"A hilarious comedy that seems to intentionally push boundaries yet still had me shaking with laughter. It is also action packed with good production, featuring a solid Mark Strong as the straight-acting brother separated as a child who is now a government spy. A friend of mine who claims to dislike comedies and only likes action movies (sigh yes I know) also liked this film.I'm not a Cohen fanboy, for example I think Ali G was genius, but I found Borat a cringe-worthy attempt to replicate the formula for the US audience. But when he hits the mark as he did in this movie he absolutely nails it."
" Reprehensible attempt at humor
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,1,"I would recommend to: Those who love pure unadulterated toilet humor.This was probably the worst movie I have seen so far this year. No scratch that - in my life. The first 10 minutes or so was relatively funny but then just went downhill - actually free-falling - from there.We all know that Sacha Baron Cohen can push the limits, but this time he went too far. I have seen comedians running out of good material and then reverting to absolute vulgarity in an attempt to re-enable their dwindling career (not that Sacha's career is dwindling unfortunately, but he is not funny anymore). Unfortunately there are people for whom nothing is sacred anymore and these are the people that will fall for this kind of tripe (I might have one or two members of my family who fall within this category and whom I love dearly but let me be honest - their overall taste in anything is definitely reprehensible).Pedophilia and kids with HIV can never be seen as funny material. Also the Elephant scene was just disgusting and as a kid from Africa, I find it deplorable to say the least.Every constant watcher should treat the Brothers Grimsby with the disdain it deserves. If I could give it a zero, I would have."
" BROTHERS GRIMSBY Tries Too Hard to Shock; Fails to Write Much That's Actually Funny
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,4,"I haven't put a lot of thought into what might've been the worst movie I saw in 2016 but I'm pretty sure THE BROTHERS GRIMSBY is a frontrunner. I really wasn't sure what to expect from it and I hadn't read much on it before watching, so it's pretty safe to say I was caught way, way off guard. It's a comedy about two brothers. One happens to be a spy with MI-6 and the other is a dimwitted soccer hooligan. It stars Mark Strong and Sascha Baron Cohen in the lead roles. I imagine you can figure out who's who. Now, I'm familiar with Cohen's work. I really liked BORAT and I didn't hate BRÃœNO, but this wasn't one of his mock documentaries where he goes to insane lengths to mess with ordinary folk through a character. I don't know what I expected this to be any different; maybe it was the inclusion of Strong, Penelope Cruz, Ian McShane, and Isla Fisher in the cast. Not only is this movie on par with Cohen's other outrageous movies; it also gives full effort to become his grossest yet. I'm not adverse to this. I can enjoy gross-out humor when it's done right. I own all three of the JACKASS films and watch them again every few years for a good laugh. The problem with THE BROTHERS GRIMSBY is that it sacrifices everything else for the sake of its incessant gags, most of which are something going in/coming out of bodies.I had to check out the writers on this film. I wanted to know who was responsible, and the answers surprised me a bit. Obviously Cohen was involved, and writer Peter Baynham has collaborated with him before on BORAT and BRÃœNO so we know he's astute at shock humor. He's also had a hand in writing for ""I'm Alan Partridge"", one of Steve Coogan's TV series and a pretty consistently funny one too. So the man has some talent. The third screenwriter, Phil Johnston, was also one of two screenwriters on ZOOTOPIA. Freaking ZOOTOPIA. So there's actual talent here and, for whatever reason, it doesn't shine through. To be fair, there are some good gags in this movie. I don't know why I laughed as much as I did at the Daniel Radcliffe bit and then laughed harder at the callback at the end of the film. But the bad outweighs the good. For every joke that'll elicit a legitimate laugh from me, there's three that fall flat and they'll telegraph the gag coming from a mile away. For example, the film's biggest bit involves an elephant. Early in the film, Nobby (Cohen) and his family are watching a nature documentary where he quotes a fact he learned about the internal size of a female elephant'sÂ…well, you can use context clues to figure it out. It's sort of weird throwaway line; weird enough to flag that it'll obviously come into play later. And it does, to an absolutely insane degree.Chances are good that the elephant gag is the one memory you'll walk away from this movie remembering. That and maybe the, ugh, caterpillar venom scene. That's because literally everything else about this movie is forgettable. The plot is simple and stupid. Nobby and Sebastian, orphans, have been separated since childhood. Nobby never gave up on his belief his brother would return (as explained in clunky exposition at the start of the film). We come to discover Sebastian has gone on to become an MI6 agent with the action hero skills of Craig-era James Bond or Jason Bourne. Nobby finds Sebastian in the middle of a mission, causes him to botch it, and Sebastian is framed as a renegade and finds himself the target of his own organization. Nobby and Sebastian go on the run to clear his name and complete the mission. Lazily-written antics ensue and the movie closes with Sebastian's acceptance of his blue-collar origins with fireworks in anuses. Again, most of the jokes in this movie revolve around something going in or coming out of a body. The movie is destined to be forgotten as one of Cohen's lesser works and Strong has hopefully learned to stick with KINGSMAN for his action fix. McShane, Cruz, and the rest should be fine, as I'd completely forgotten they were in this movie when I sat down to watch it a second time (I wanted to give it a fair chance and ensure it wasn't just a poor first impression).THE BROTHERS GRIMSBY isn't unforgivably bad. I'm sure it'll find some sort of audience and develop a minor fan base for the extreme levels they're willing to go in this film. I'm guilty of sharing with friends as with an insistence that ""You have to see this movie. It's just bonkers."" I'm sure most would agree it's in no sense a ""good"" movie, but it's primo material to entertain on a night when no one's sober and easy laughs are best."

" Better than expected, but my expectations were set very low
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,5,"Nobby Graves is a working class man, with a wife and several kids, living in Grimsby. His brother, Sebastian, went missing 28 years ago and he hasn't seen him since. Little does he know that Sebastian is now a secret agent with MI6.

Nobby goes to the event to meet Sebastian but hinders Sebastian's operation, making Sebastian look like the perpetrator of a terrorist act. Trying to track down the actual terrorists while on the run from the law, the two brothers now need to rely on each other more than ever...Better than expected, though that doesn't say much. I wasn't expecting much, as the trailer looked rather low-brow and puerile. Turns out, it is mostly low-brow and puerile, but it does have some very funny scenes and lines. It also has some of the most over-the- top scenes you'll ever see, scenes that really rely more on shock value than anything else for their laughs.Overall: silly but has its moments.The earlier stuff of Sacha Baron Cohen, who wrote and stars in Grimsby - Da ALi G Show, Borat and Bruno - was brilliantly funny. That humour was of a candid camera nature, relying on the other participants to be unaware that it was a set up. Now that he has turned his hand to non-candid humour, his movies are far less funny and far more low- brow. The Dictator was okay, but not great, and with Grimsby the trend in quality is downward. A pity, as he is an incredibly talented man and is capable of far better than this."
" Terrible film, unfunny - sad to see the decline of SBC
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,4,"If you're a fan of Baron-Cohen, don't watch this. It's a big disappointment for a career that once shone so brightly.If I had to rate Baron-Cohen's works, it would be the original Ali G TV show, then the US version, then the early British film, maybe tied with Bruno and Borat, and this is way, way, way at the bottom.Ali G used to make me laugh so hard I would cry. I still watch those old DVDs sometimes and it's still funny, many years later. This film was not funny the first time.A lot of the intelligent word play, intentional misunderstandings and confusions, all those tiny smart things are gone. Baron-Cohen once made a joke about selling or buying nuclear weapons from/to the UK, when the guest said ""Kazakhstan does not have nuclear weapons"" to which Borat replied ""turn off the camera, this interview is over."" You laugh because of the implications, the unspoken idea that Kazakhstan might have nuclear weapons. A crazy thought. Have the joke is on the camera and the other is your mind filling the blanks.Here, there is no subtlety, nothing unspoken or unsaid. Everything is shown. The insides of an elephant, an elephant orgy, butts, testicles, you name it. Everything is explicit. It's not crass humor, it's crassness instead of humor. We all laughed at Borat saying ""I took a bit sh*t to a dinner party"" or references to his sister, a prostitute, being recognized by the Almaty Chamber of Commerce. We laughed at ""sexy time"" or him awkwardly coming on to guests or Uncle Jamal's ""accident"" with a vacuum cleaner.It wasn't subtle, but it was not unsubtle either, and it was very effective.Here, it's all overdone. Instead of Baron-Cohen asking a copper if a court would believe that he was cutting his lunch with an attack knife, rushed to pick the phone and the knife slipped into his sock and stayed there while he caught the bus to work and accidentally stabbed someone a few times, a highly ridiculous and contrived story, laughing at Ali G's dumb criminality, here this film has him screaming into a megaphone at a world cup final ""we are scum.""Baron-Cohen's former personas were a social commentary, providing funny commentary and criticism at everything, from the United Nations to country clubs, from bars in the American South to environmentalist protests in the UK.This show is just a series of cheap laughs at easy targets. Fart jokes, fat jokes, tea-bagging, etc.There were some actual moments of comedy, but they're lost in a sea of meh."
" Grim Indeed
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,2,"Sacha Baron Cohen can be very hit and miss. When he hits he can be brilliant such as his Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan and when he misses? Well, we have Bruno.In the non-mockumentary category The Dictator was a fairly fun and a surprisingly funny romp and now we have the follow-up miss. The Brothers Grimsby is simply awful. Cohen and his clan of characters are so utterly unlikeable and the gross-out jokes so forced it simply is painful to watch.Gross out comedy can work. Borat's naked wrestling scene is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. That movie earned its gross-out scene which came from the characters interactions. This movie forces ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario in a bizarre game of one- upmanship.As for the characters. Well, the idea of James Bond having an incompetent simpleton brother following him around has good comedic potential. Cohen's character and those he surrounds himself with are simply unlikable and not a group one want to spend any time around. Sentimental about the classless freeloading scum and gross beyond the point of funny The Brothers Grimsley is a chore to even watch."
" Predictable storyline uses gross to find surprises
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,3,"The 'different worlds thrown together by threat from authority' is obviously as old as the hills but there can be different takes on it that keep it fresh and a pleasure to see.This is the crass and obvious take on it with none of said ingenuity applied. The storyline then needs to be rescued from being entirely predictable and this done with shock-gags and 'gross out' gags, so-called because it's 144 times less funny than it could have been.Mark Strong is impeccably brilliant, a true gem, and plenty of supporting actors deliver great cameo-sized moments.There are also a handful of laugh out loud moments that I loved and made me pursue the film. But not many moments and this is 90 minutes."
" Over the top
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,8,"Have seen the trailer I thought to give it a try. I didn't really knew what to expect because it showed that the trailer was hiding things.Let me say that that was true. This flick goes over the top and can offend some viewers. Did I had a laugh, sure, over the top is no problem for me. You ask yourself were they went over the top, well, it do has a lot of sexual jokes so I wont recommend it to younger viewers, face it, the children do swear like a trooper but it's all funny. There are jokes with some existing actors and people but the offending stuff lays in the joke with elephants. You love or hate it.The story itself isn't that bad after all. One brother working undercover and the other one being an England supporter. Together they will rescue earth. Be sure to watch until the end which mean after the end credits there's a joke hidden. It's one big joke, stupid, funny, action, and exaggerated flick. I loved it but many will dislike this. To give you a reference, if Borat (2006) was your stuff then you will enjoy this.

" Literally one of the worst films ever
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,1,"I attempted to watch this film yesterday on Sky. I couldn't even get to the end , it was THAT bad. I cannot believe that anyone who read this script would even have thought this would make a good movie. It appears to have been written by a 10 year old boy, as that's the level of the ""humour"" though I can't honestly bring myself to call it that. And to read that the budget for this was Â£35 million - outrageous. The scene with the elephants was one of the worst I have ever had the misfortune to watch. The use of the word ""grim"" in the title has to be deliberate,surely. For grim it is. I cannot for the life of me understand how this has gotten any good reviews..........."
" It could be a fun flick but in the end was a piece of junk.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"Gimsby is the latest of Sacha Baron Cohen gross comedy films and after that I am done with him and any future enterprise of him. The flick follows the super agent Sebastian Graves ,who in his latest mission he encounters his lost brother Nobi,a 100% dedicated football hooligan, in order to take out an arm's dealer or something like that I don't know in the mid point I jumped ship.Now to be honest the film during the first twenty minutes it is a decent spoof of the spy genre and even the gross jokes work, but after a while the plot becomes even more outrageous to the point that I was waiting Roger Moore or Rabbit (in their movies the plot is over the top in each case) to show up and do his thing! Yea, when you become a live action cartoon it never ends well and this flick it is no exception, for it is like they mixed the Looney Tunes with the Jackass crew, put them in a clichÃ© spy plot and that was called a movie. Really man?Mr. Cohen and your team ,it is time to under stand that the reign of the disgusting humor is over since at least 2012. And if we wanted to be real after the first Hangover and Jackass two we haven seen a good film with disgusting humor. In short this style is out of fashion do something else you are a creative team figure it out.In short the film doesn't worth your time just skip it and watch something better and maybe more family friendly in order to show that your aren't a weirdo ,who perhaps has more in common with the Joker rather than an average Joe in the psychology department!"
" Not Ali G's best.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,4,"Now, there has been many a time friends and myself have ridiculed certain films envisioning a comical or spoof version, even films we adore. Sacha Baron Cohen writes a story that's precisely that. What if James Bond had that annoying, beyond stupid brother that just ruins every moment they share. Action director Louis Leterrier who's best work would be Statham vehicle, The Transporter, MCU's Incredible Hulk and the first Now You See Me, actually puts his skill into play here creating some clever action sequences. In particular, Mark Strong's character introduction which even though feels like a cheap copy of Hardcore Henry's POV style, it's actually very well done and entertaining, but then it should be no surprised that Hardcore Henry's creator and director Ilya Naishuller served as a consultant for that very sequence. Mark Strong plays the super spy, special agent Sebastian Graves, oozing finesse, control and confidence where he's reunited with his lost lost older brother Grimsby's very own Nobby, played by Cohen. I would like to say he's the village idiot but it seems the town's complete population is of the same caliber. The plot makes good for stupid antics however, most are not that funny and are probably for an acquired taste of comedy. Cohen's makes good use of each comical opportunity, imagining what would an idiot do if they suddenly became a secret agent. I have no idea why PenÃ©lope Cruz would take such a part but she's does a terrible job. Isla Fisher is understandable, being Cohen's wife and Rebel Wilson is exactly who you expect. Films seem to allowing a lot of unnecessary genitalia scenes, but it's just uncouth but I suppose it has the desired affect. (Edit: Not the most uncouth filthy film of 2016, nothing's gonna quite top Sausage Party) Unfortunately, as much as Cohen is talented and funny, often pushing the comic boundaries far and beyond inappropriate, it's fairly awful and not one of his best. Strong is actually really good and can't imagine how hard it must have been starring opposite Cohen. Some people should find this film hilarious, but it did nothing for me apart from make me cringe and be semi-impressed with Graves' introduction.

" Years of not laughing like this
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"im not a big fan of football nor sex jokes and this kind of movies in general. but this one! at one point i was worried about getting a stroke or something, i watched it just to fall in sleep and because i saw a fx making of on youtube.but i just could not stop laughing,and laughing hard.the movie is an example of effort in all matters and an example of how Hollywood culture in general is just worthless as in years they haven't come with something like this or other movies. where creativity,effort and risk just leads natural.here you can see really good and new attempts of everything,action, comedy,jokes,script, i would dare to say that for the first time i see actors (Acting).if Hollywood would full produce this movie there would be. Ben Affleck,Vin Diesel,Mark Wahlberg or tom cruise as actors and for so in order to respect (Their) fame and image. 90% of the jokes, script,editing,action,etc,etc. would be taken off.And even if they didn't. the simply fact of one of them being there would trash the whole movie.this movie represents what cinema was created for. like it or not. be it your kind of movie or not. in general terms this is what films are meant for."
