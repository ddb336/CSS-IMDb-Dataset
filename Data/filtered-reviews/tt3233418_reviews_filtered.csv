" Good but not amazing
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,8,I saw this movie back in a 8th grade math class. I admit I only watched it because it had George Lopez but it was surprising entertaining. But this movie did have it's moments and was nice nice to know that it was based on an actual time. Although it does get a little slow in the 2nd quarter but it had some nice cheesy-ish humor.
" Better than anticipated
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,8,"George Lopez usually annoys me, but he did a really nice job in this, and really the whole cast was solid. Marisa Tomei played her part very well and provided multiple laughs.I typically enjoy true story movies, but they're usually cheesy OR so much dramatic license is taken that it barely resembles the true story in the end. This film managed to accomplish telling the story without falling into either trap (ok, a little cheesyness, but really not too bad). This is what America is all about, and I really enjoyed learning about these young men's story.Would recommend for anyone. And it gets extra kudos for doing it all without needing to throw in bad language, sex, or violence. Well done to all involved in the movie."
" Not Bad
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,8,This was actually a pretty good movie. I just can't take George Lopez seriously though when he does emotional scenes lol But I did enjoy this film and cried at some scenes. The message was very good and I believe in it wholeheartedly.
" 11 stars
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,10,This is a great example of how engineering makes life better in everyway. Very inspirational.
" Story of America
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,10,This story about 4 undocumented high school boys who were lucky enough to have two teachers that believed. Based on a true story you must watch. Bring a tear to your eyes.
" Good story. George Lopez can really act
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,7,"I saw this movie on Roku and decided to see how good it was considering George Lopez. Jamie Lee Curtis, Esai Morales, Alexa Vega and Marisa Tomei are all in it. This is the best acting Lopez has ever done. It's amazing how the high school kids beat out Ivy League colleges at the robotics contest. Very good acting overall. Plus, it's a true story. Nice heartwarming movie, too. Aside from ""Soul Surfer"" this is one of Sean McNamara's best films. I highly recommend it."
" howcome never heard of
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,10,"This was just a heartbreaking and heartmending beautiful film for everybody, even for a grumpy old man like me. its a full 10 star for the easy and never the less acting, spontanity, and the everlasting happy ending. if you hang yourself up in the details of the story, then go hang deg, because its a moodbooster of tremendous dimensions if your on the hunt for a goodfeel story."
" I SAW SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN A HORROR MOVIE ONCE
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,10,"Based on a true story, a group of high school students on a limited budget create an underwater robotic machine for competition. The kids are undocumented immigrants and take a chance competing.If you have seen ""Stand and Deliver,"" ""McFarland,"" or ""Up in Smoke"" you must realize it is just a matter of time before Spanish speaking people will take over the world. The film creates internal conflict to keep us watching and spends minimum time on the mechanics. At one point a kid says to Jamie Lee Curtis, ""I saw something like this in a horror movie once."" Perhaps the funniest line in the film, for me anyway.It is a decent family film. There some fighting and parental yelling. The theme of the film supports ""The Dream Act."""
" Wonderful story brought to life
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,10,From the start it grabs your attention and brings a true story to life - a great story. The whole family loves it- very enjoyable üëçüëçüëç
" Good history
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,6,"Good real history but not so good movie. Nevertheless, you should see and be inspired for these kids who work hard to make a difference."
" Very pleasantly suprised
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,8,When i heard about this movie i thought it was going to be a sterotypical underdog storie where they barely make it and then win in the end but its totally not. That is still basically what the movie is but its also very insipring and emotional. A few parts were predictable but thats ok in my opinion. Overall its a great movie that i think everyone should watch
" Mr Roboto Approves!
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic family friendly movie about perseverance and heart. Based on a true story about immigrant high school kids that form a robotics club in an attempt to get a leg up on their next journey in life. They face many obstacles: family, money, no papers, bad attitudes; but they have heart, will, & determination in spades! Lovely movie worth a rental. Fun for the whole family."
" Engrossing
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,10,"I stumbled upon this movie. I am a big fan of anything science or engineering related. I am pleased to have found this. The story is a bit trite but has enough twists and turns to keep my attention. Generally, I watch part of a move and then watch the remainder later. This is one of the rare times I watched the whole thing without a break. I would suggest that you do not do any research before watching. There is a very big surprise at the end."
" Standard feel good story
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,7,"Spare Parts closely mimics Disney's McFarland. A group of high school kids get tutored by an outsider who comes into their community. They exceed expectations, compete against a rich, white community, and overachieve with no budget or support. McFarland used running, while Spare Parts used science. They even had the same scene where the kids go to California, never saw an ocean, and go jumping around in it. Plus the star gets a non-immigrant girlfriend. Despite this obvious borrowing of plot, the story succeeds because of the strong acting from George Lopez as the teacher, Marisa Tomei as a counselor, and Jamie Lee Curtis as the hilarious principal.The bottom line is again that these kids have no shot at success. They have no papers, illegals. But somehow they get inspired to try to make something from basically nothing. They are smart, and tough, but they need a chance. The movie states that it is based on a true story, and the end credits show real pictures of the real people, like is done in so many based-on-true-story movies. I liked Spare Parts, but I think McFarland was better, perhaps because of Kevin Costner's role having more body to it, vs George Lopez, whose character never got fully developed enough to make you feel more for him. At any rate, for a feel good movie, Spare Parts will give you good feelings, so I recommend it. Enjoy."
" The immigrants and the miracle .
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"I really liked the movie's morals , this movie tells you that everyone has his mission in this life , nobody is useless here , his value might not be noteworthy as for solo work , but it will be remarkable in a team work , and that's what the movie incites us to do or rather shows us ,and how strong and full of surprises the team work is . The movie highlighted on another major point , which is the immigrants , showed us how gainful they might be , and that they are not all alike , a lot of them are genial who love The US more than its natives , and some won't hesitate to help for no return , and how some of them are suffering because the ICE pursues them but they don't want to go back to Mexico because they like The USA , they want to be part of the community , so as i grasp ,the message was to deport the criminals and support the smart and diligent or even the people who want to serve America in any way , the movie attained a huge earnings and i believe it deserved it , i gave this movie 8 because of some expected scenes or moments , but overall the movie worth the 115 minutes ."
" A bit typical but still very much touching
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"It's not gonna win any awards for most original screenplay or anything.The theme of underdogs going against the odds to try to win big in competitions have been done countless times before and the script follows the same mold more or less as far as that goes.But what it does have that's a little above the average is some truly likable characters that you just can't help but to root for.4 Hispanic teenagers from a rougher part of town, some with no paperwork to live in the US attempts to rise above what is expected from them (which in short is really not much) and become the first group from their school to enter a robotics competition.The cast is nothing short but excellent, with lesser known actors as the teenagers but also George Lopez as their teacher and in supporting roles there are Marisa Tomei, Esai Morales and Jamie Lee Curtis.The soundtrack is also really really good with latino acts such as Frankie J, Fonseca and Ozomatli mixing some pop, rap and r&b and latino, will definitely try to see if the soundtrack is avaible somewhere.So yeah if you're looking for something to get your emotions going and something that's also based on a true story then this should definitely do the trick."
