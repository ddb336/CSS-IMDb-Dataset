" Meh, not exciting
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,5,So the drone was stuck in a tree for almost a day with full battery juice and propellers and camera running like its on nuke power!!😂😂
" Sad
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,2,"How is the average rating a 5.0?
Totally unoriginal messy sequel kinda movie.
Please first watch the blair witch project before this then I assure you will rate this movie a 1 or 2/10"
" Seriously meh...
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,2,"It's good to see the Blair Witch has upped her game a bit, but between the constant shakey-cam and the never ending screaming most of the time I didn't know what was happening. Also, I wish they had fleshed out what happened with Lain. Like how long had he been there (or perceived himself to have been there) in the hous and what did he mean by ""you have to do what she says"". Furthermore, at the time Heather would have gone missing, 1994, James would have been like 4 years old and 16 years apart from his sister (I believe those children are called ""accidents"") so they couldn't have been close. In fact, he would probably not remember her terribly well. Overall, not really worth the time it took to watch."
" NO.
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,3,Do not even THINK about seeing this garbage. For your safety.
" Scream! Scream!! More Screaming!!!
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,6,"Well,, it's definitely a lot better than the first one, lol."
" Lightning in a bottle...or not
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,3,"The BWP was successful, largely in part because it was one of the first to capitalized on the found footage horror genre. BW2: BOS proved that the storyline was garbage, even with its increased production budget.
Somewhere around the 20-teens, Hollywood got lazy and started remaking old horror flicks (The Evil Dead, for example) and THIS...
Basically the entire plot was just another group of human cannon fodder goes into the woods and gets terrorized by the spirit, then they all die...end of movie.
What made this worse for me was the sporadic camera work which made much of the film largely unwatchable. In a movie entirely reliant on jump scares, it's hard to be scared when you're not clear what you're actually seeing. The acting was what you'd expect from a B Horror film, although not as bad as it could have been. There's no nudity, so it wasn't a true B horror flick, but it certainly toes the line.
The mere premise that the main character thinks his sister could still be living in the woods 16 yrs later wasn't just lame, it left me wondering if perhaps he should have been medicated.
As someone who grew up in the woods, you should never go wandering out into unfamiliar territory, with strangers whom you've never met before. Also, who keeps finding all this footage and how did THEY make it out?
At the end of the day, this film was poorly conceived and was the film equivalent of someone jumping out behind you and screaming in your ear. It's not so much scary as it is annoying."
" A dumb remake of a smart movie.
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,2,"Simple.
The first movie was smart, this one is dumb."
" Tree falls in the woods, it'll fall on you.
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,6,"This movie is VERY VERY ANNOYING TO WATCH! The jump scares are obnoxious and Unnecessary! So annoying! Glad they all die! Ashley and talia were the most annoying. Lane was the dumbest. Who goes far away to pee?! In The 2nd Jurassic park, a dude went far from campsite to pee! Really?! I pee in crowded parking lots in front of stores, in my empty gallon water jug! Nobody sees me! They dont think ill pee in a jug, but i do! I pretend im looking for something. And these idiots in these movies have to stray far away to pee?! I can understand to poop but to pee?! Im the professional pee-er! I can pee anywhere and most cases nobody will think im peeing. Lane was an idiot! Ashley was annoying! Talia annoying!The movie has potential. I like how funny the 15 minute mark was when lane was all serious saying ""nobody alive, anyway"" and black dude laughs! I laugh so hard at that point! Lol. I think the ""witch"" couldve looked more like a witch, not a walking tree from lord of the rings 2. And some other things explained, like the lights at the end. But yeah, the reviews are accurate. They yell and scream a lot! They do a lot of dumb things. ""ASHLEEYYYYYYYYY!"" As i type this, they're yelling that out! Very annoying! The house part is very creepy, though. STOP PUTTING IN FORCED JUMP SCARES! Stop it! The original Blair witch project was WAY MORE ANNOYING THAN THIS MOVIE! The yelling, the lack of direction. But this was better. Just a lot of dumb things. If only hillary clinton, camel face harris and gavin newsom could get trapped in these woods and meet the blair witch. And mayor garcetti, too. Would be a great movie to watch them struggle in the woods. Lol. Wait, hillary already in the woods of new york. Is she related to blair witch? Wow! Fun times."
" Uhhhh
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,1,"Black people hiking in the woods with white folk? Alone? Two of which had Confederate flags in their house, who they just met? Who's old uncle wrote this? We would NOT be in this situation!"
" I believe even the mainstream majority who were ordered by their media overlords to think the 2nd film was terrible would admit it wasn't half as bad as this one.
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,4,"I have written pretty thorough reviews for the first and second titles of this under-developed franchise. I will not be doing so for this one. Blair Witch is an amateur attempt to live up to the fame and genius of its predecessors, one that has failed tragically. I firmly believe that even the rare chosen few who have recognized the 2nd title (Book of Shadows) for the spectacular creation that it was (and still is) will not be able to avoid shedding a tear of grief for the death of the brilliant idea that was once The Blair Witch.The beginning of the story is actually quite promising. Approximately 15 years after the incident at Black Hills Woods the younger brother of Heather sets out looking for his sister, accompanied by his best friends (one of which is shooting a documentary about it) and two internet weirdos who initially uploaded a footage they claimed to have found at the premises. A very nice combination of the framing plot of each of the first titles. From there? Every single possible mistake is made.First and foremost - the film is way too visual, and I mean that in the worse sense possible. Sad attempts at faking bits of a fear factor through plain distasteful gor; low quality shots in which you can't really see anything (you just know ""oh, I'm supposed to be scared now"" because everybody on screen is screaming); and the worst - an attempt to actually embody and present the evil presence of the Blair woodland. I mean, seriously, how desperate could you get?! One of the most basic and crucial components of the fear factor which has kept spectators on edge for 21 years is the fact that the evil doesn't have a face! That's how every viewer is prompted to imagine their worse graphic nightmare. The second you show it on screen, everything's gone, and it's not because of the cheap unoriginal figure itself. Last but not least - after around 40 minutes in which absolutely nothing new happens, suddenly the plot and conclusions of a full film are clumsily crammed into 15 minutes of screen time. Seriously, the original film students back in 1999 could have shot a better film.Now, credit where it's due - the final five mintes or so are very, very well made and quite terrifying. That's the only part I'd keep and add to the Blair Witch chronicles. But you can't expect anyone to forgive 75 minutes of mediocre stale disappointments to just becasue the final 5 were good (or even great).Is Blair Witch bad? No. Should you watch it in order to get your personal closure, after watching the original TBWP 21 years ago? Absolutely. Is it going to be half as good as you've probably hoped? No. Far from it. So lower your expectations in advance and do not spend a penny on this."
" Worse than the first
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,1,This was horrible! Crappy camera work and way too much screaming for nothing. None of these movies lead anywhere. Just a complete waste of time
" Not horrible, but a big dissapointment
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,4,"An unnecessary reboot of a genre making flick, Blair Witch sadly is no match for its predecessors, and lacks any true originality or unique natures to be a decent time to watch, not to mention memorable. I really wanted to like this film, I have watched all the films in the series with an open mind, as many people don't enjoy them. However, this one just didn't do it for me, in fact I found it very annoying and frustrating to watch. First off, there are almost zero scares in this flick. All of the suspense made up in the first flick, and the psychological nature of the second is just thrown out the window for some jump scares, and some pretty humiliating ones at that. There are maybe one or two intense like moments throughout, but sadly there is just nothing gripping about this film, and I left feeling kinda disappointed and somewhat bored. The acting is fine I guess, but the actors just have nothing to work with, there is so little to be done for them, and truly they shouldn't have to work this hard to move the plot. I've never been a fan of the original film's ending, but somehow this film did an even worse job at wrapping things up, which is even more horrible when you think about how much potential it had for the end. The large majority of the first third- to first half of the film is just these 20 something year olds arguing and yelling at each other. It gets so old after a while, I almost turned it off. It has some cool moments, some interesting concepts, but none of them are executed properly. Perhaps the worst thing about the film is that it doesn't feel like a missed opportunity, it just doesn't feel like a fully functioning film at all, even less a horror flick- and in the end, as disappointed as I was, part of me was just glad it was over.
My Rating: 4/10"
" Ok it was fun
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,7,It was a fun scary movie ok not to be taken too seriously I'm not sure what ppl were looking for lol
" Better than expected
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,7,"I find this movie pretty good. Time bending was not as confusing as I thought it would be and the events that are happening make sense. The only thing I didnt like, was the missing of peter and his girlfriend. We never saw them again and dont know what happened to them. They probably died but they could've let us see what really happened. Overall it was a great movie"
" 3.5 Hours of Boredom
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,2,"The movie is extremely long, the end is very over done to the point of silly. The sound track at the end does not add anything. The production is poor. Nothing happens at the beginning or the middle, the first 2 hours consist of watching a group of people go camping and experience a few supernatural moments. These moments are 20 minutes from each other. The movie is interesting in how much story it tells, watching it is like watching a home video diary. This makes it an extremely poor horror movie. There was nothing that could have made it a better movie from the cast, it needed a condensed script, premium linking scenes and a decent audio and visual production. A foray into teenage rebellion whilst camping and nudity would have made the movie complete trash. The location of filming and more natural beuaty, in a style similar to the Revanent with its Grotesque soundtrack, would have truly added to the movie."
" A GOOD SCARY SEQUEL TO A HORROR MASTERPIECE
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,8,"Blair Witch is about the younger brother of Heather Donahue from the first film that vanished in the terrifying black hill woods in Marland, here James gets some friends together to venture out there to do his own investigation, although this is like over 12yrs or so later, James is now older & convinced his sister is some how still alive within the woods because of an on-line video that shows a glimpse of a girl in an old decrepit house. That's the basic story here & it's simple & easy to follow as our group of friends armed with lots of technology head out into those infamous woods.
I still remember the huge EVENT that was the first film way back in 1999 & i loved all the fuss about it & if it was real found footage & all the creepy missing people ads & documentaries on the Internet, it was a fun time to love the Horror genre again & be into Horror which i was obsessed with then!!! The Blair Witch Project is the scariest film i had ever seen ever & it's still the scariest & most creepiest even today in 2020, that's what an impact it had & what a damn good & well made Horror movie it is. Anyway the first film is a stone-cold Horror Classic Masterpiece & it's long awaited sequel is a strong Horror film in it's own right. I admit that the characters are less likable than the first films trio & none stand out as good actors but it's fine because we're here to watch the terror of what's in those woods scare everyone outta their minds & it does the job pretty well, not as raw, real & great as the unbearable atmosphere of dread that the first film dishes out but it's still got a solid darkness to it & often still very unnerving & scary. Blair Witch does give us some terrifying glimpses of the creature in the woods & it's scary as hell!!! It's not over done which i liked & it's small scale little glimpses & that's enough to be truly scary & had me on the edge of my seat.
The Blair Witch Mythology is discussed within the new group & i liked that & it's genuinely a good Horror movie & sequel to a Classic. Good late-night Horror fun"
" A worthy addition to the series
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,6,"I'm more of a fan of the idea of The Blair Witch Project and the related films. Found footage is an awesome concept, but it usually isn't done that well. My biggest complaint about found footage films is that I sincerely think most people would ditch the cameras as soon as gets real.Blair Witch felt pretty natural and I wasn't constantly questioning why they would continue filming. The forest felt a lot more sinister and alive than the original, with characters missing and reappearing disoriented in time and location.The original was brave for not showing the Blair Witch. Who wasn't kind of disappointed about that? In this film, split second glimpses of the evil spirit are seen, striking a good balance between revealing too much and nothing at all.The shaky cameras were fairly nauseating in the first film, but I found this one easy to watch.In many ways, this one was very similar to the original, but it is just more fun to watch."
" Nothing of substance happened
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,1,Boring movie with annoying characters and nothing really scary or interesting happening to the end of the movie
" Another one for the list...
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,3,"Being a big fan of 'The Blair Witch Project', I did get more than a little excited back in 2000 for the release of 'Book Of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'. At the mere mention of that title, those of you in the know will no doubt be way ahead of me, so I'll cut it short. I was disappointed.
As a painful result of that experience, I have now grown much more weary of sequels in general (particularly ones with the words Blair and Witch in their titles) which is why I put off watching this film until now.'Blair Witch' overlooks that second film entirely and serves as an extension to 'The Blair Witch Project'. In this film, we find James Donahue (brother of Heather) still searching for his sister. A video posted on You Tube contains what James thinks is an image of Heather and believing her to still be alive, he heads out to the woods near Burkittsville to search for her. James also takes along three friends; Peter, Ashley and Lisa, the latter wishing to film the whole thing for a documentary. They are also joined by Lane and Talia who initially uploaded the video.Since this film takes place over a decade after the events of Heather, Michael, Josh and their ill fated trip to the woods, this film obviously has a more modernised look and a significant update of tech. For me, this was one of it's downfalls, as what this also means is that any of the atmosphere and creepiness that 'The Blair Witch Project' had in spades (particularly through the use of the 16mm and Hi8 video cameras) is sadly negated here.
One of the things 'The Blair Witch Project' also understood so well is that the things you don't see are just as important as those you do.
The original film massively divided its audience; some loving it for its ambiguity and others expecting more of a spoonfed slasher about an evil witch.
It seems as if director Adam Wingard has listened far too much to the latter audience and has merely tried to serve up what they thought had been missing. So what you're left with are several (mostly forced and pointless) jump scares, the occasional glimpse of a creature who may or may not be the witch herself, more blood than the original film, but very little else holding it all together. I much enjoyed his work on 'You're Next' and 'V/H/S' but with 'Blair Witch', Adam Wingard seemed to shun his creativity in favour of simply trying to please the haters of 'The Blair Witch Project'.While by no means being the first ever film of this nature, 'The Blair Witch Project' did certainly inspire a great deal of imitators and pretty much kickstarted a vast outpouring of what are now known as 'found footage' films. But like with every genre, some are done well, while others fall very flat.'Blair Witch' is yet another film that could quite easily make it onto that ever growing list titled, 'Did this really need to be made?' But it seems likely that more films will follow until someone learns that the sheer impact 'The Blair Witch Project' had in 1999 simply cannot be repeated and that a good film is more than capable of standing up on it's own."
" Where Wingard fares best is in evoking an unnerving mood.
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,3,"The Blair Witch is capable of felling giant trees, warping time and space, and even foiling electronics: Just kill these poor kids already and be done with it."
" Decent
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,7,Too many jump scares. Besides that it tells the story of the black woods myth rather well. Builds suspense. The most scary aspect of these films is theres always some truth to the supernatural myths theyre based on.
" Enjoyable without great expectations
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,8,"Whereas the cast of characters were quite forgettable, I really enjoyed the intensity of this film. The beginning Is quite slow and even uninteresting at times but the second half of the film had a few exhilarating scenes that kept me on the edge of my seat. I didn't have great expectations beforehand and I didn't expect a cinematic masterpiece but I got an enjoyable weekday horror movie experience.Usually horror movies start loosing their interest to me towards the end when the mystery or evil gets exposed but I thought this movie endes at the perfect time."
" Jump scares until you're numb with indifference
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,3,"The main thing this movie gets wrong is the ""found footage"" angle. The original actually looked like found footage - shot from a handheld camera with extremely natural performances from the actors.Clearly the producers of ""Blair Witch"" wanted something that looked like found footage, but also like a traditional movie. The conceits they employed to attempt to straddle that canyon are laughable. We've got a drone, ear-mounted cameras for each of the indistinguishable actors... the movie really hammers this point home to try and explain to us why this ""found footage"" is going to look more like a regular movie.Except... it doesn't work, for two main reasons. First, the actors act like actors... not like real people. It's so obviously scripted, there's a kind of forced reality to it, a bit like you see in commercials where an actor is pretending to be a member of the public. They're not even particularly likeable, and seem to come from a cookie cutter of horror movie stereotypes.But the biggest problem is it's shot and cut together like a regular horror movie, with shots from the various cameras cut together to create dramatic narrative. There's even ambient background music at some points. And would anyone who discovered found footage really keep every time someone bumped into someone else and edit it in as a jump scare? Seriously... there are times when there's more than one jump scare per minute. No amount of adding hilariously fake-looking ""camera glitch"" and NIN-like sound effects sells this as genuine.There are plenty of other movies that have managed to get this formula right... and plenty of other regular horror movies that are extremely scary. By attempting to have their cake and eat it, the producers of this movie have sucked all possible tension and suspense from ""Blair Witch"". This movie is simply tedious and repetitive."
" This movie
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,2,"Is not good.
How long does this review have to be. I mean what I wrote is all that needs to be said. Anything more would be too much effort.But, if you like a movie with people yelling at each other for an hour and thirty minutes this movie is a 10/10.There's also a bit where centipedes come out of some girls wound. It's kind of gross but a cool effect."
" Completely underrated and misunderstood in my opinion
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,9,"Yes. We do get to see the Blair witch this time around in the last 5 - 10 min of the movie. I think this movie is on par with the first movie. Its actually that great. And I really loved the subtlety in this one where a drone was used to capture landscape of the forest for them to find the so called ""house"" where James's sister was last heard from the first movie. And also, of course, the earpiece cameras were a great subtle addition and made things more ""on the edge of my seat"" I guess. Normally in many found footage horror movies, the protagonist is the one holding the camera the entire time or sometimes their partner/best friend etc. But that wasn't the case with this movie. Every actor/actress got an equal amount of screen time because of the earpiece cameras, and I feel like that's rare with found footage films. There were a plethora of jump scares and man I got spooked like hell. However, there were some things I was able to easily predict like the main protagonist, right from the first 15 min. The director Adam Wingard directed a couple other found footage horrors that I hope I will enjoy and this dude was the perfect pic to direct this movie imo. I hope he directs a found footage alien/ufo movie sometime in the near future, I know that sounds kinda corny but that's just what I'm into nowadays."
" Modern Adaptation with New Twists. Questionable Execution.
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,5,"In this requel of the 1999 cult phenomenon, ""The Blair Witch Project"" younger brother of Heather Donahue, James sets out to find his lost sister after allegedly seeing her in a YouTube video. A bit far fetched but James and co set out to find Heather or what might be left of her. Compared to the original the first hour is very similar yet contrived of any authenticity. The Blair Witch Project itself a product of fiction yet it's cinematic visual style and non-scripted performances made it believable.Blair Witch (2016) makes no effort to invent the wheel other than appeal to the new generation with flashy visuals, technology, and more scares. Which there aren't many of. There is no buildup of dread or tension and this film suffers by presenting many lackluster and unearned jump scares. There is also no connective tissue between this group like Heather, Josh, and Mike making some of the characters and their relationship quite stale. The lore is however built upon after gratuitous exposition in the first hour to great results. The witches control of the forest is presented more clearly here as it appears she has cast a time loop upon the wood and seems to have a more direct influence on the characters psyche.When the remaining cast members finally arrive at the rusted out old house in the woods the film goes into full throttle showcasing the witches ultimate influence. This includes the revelation that it was in fact Lisa in the video that was found by Lane before the events of the film. This is where the timeline gets seriously convoluted and really makes you think about the power the witch possesses. ""Blair Witch"" is an interesting attempt at reinvigorating the long dormant franchise and is a so so worthy sequel but it also fails at capturing the raw magical phenomena of the first and its characters."
" Bad sequel, worst remake, pointless
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,1,"This movie sucks! It is a bad sequel or just a worse remake.
Footage movies were interesting when they 1st appeared... but now, this one was made for brainless people, all dialogues are stupid, characters are un appailing and flat, whole movie is a pointless running at forest at night and screaming.Do not watch if your time is precious."
" (ARCHIVE REVIEW) ""Stop recording... No, seriously, just stop!""
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,5,"Real quick before we begin: I'm probably going to break some eggs when I type this, but as much as I recognize the impact that the first Blair Witch Project had on storytelling and filmmaking, I don't believe it's aged especially well. Its ""found footage"" tropes have been used by countless newer films in the sub-genre, as has its clever use of viral marketing, and alas there is little to the one that started it all besides the fact that it did just that. The imagery is mostly trees, the acting isn't always great, the ad-libbing can be blatant, and it takes the idea of ""less is more"" to an extreme where you think ""well, that's true, but something woulda been nice"".Since the film first came out and nevertheless scared the bajeezus out of just about everyone in 1999, the found-footage concept has been milked to death and beyond after such movies as Paranormal Activity and Cloverfield popularized it. There has also been an infamous quasi-sequel to it, known as Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, which was so insanely idiotic and ill-conceived that I've probably blasphemed against the original classic by even bringing it up. So let's move on.The second attempt at a sequel, a recent release simply titled Blair Witch (kinda like how the follow-up to Rambo III was just called Rambo), is the movie we're looking at today. If Wizard of Oz can get a continuation four decades after its release, I guess 17 years isn't too long a wait. Assuming that anyone actually wanted to see a second Blair Witch movie all this time. Either way, much like 10 Cloverfield Lane, the fact that we were getting another Blair Witch film was kept in the shadows until its release date was near.The new Blair Witch comes with a modern spin. The shtick is still that it's composed of eerie footage from lost tapes that someone found and edited together, but its protagonists also make use of iPad cameras, copters and GoPro rigs (which must have made it especially cumbersome to cut all this found footage into the film we see before us). They also look for images of the titular Blair Witch online and in mysterious YouTube clips. It's videos like these that inspires them to head into the forests of Maryland with equipment a plenty and seek out this enigmatic woman, or creature, or whatever it is (if anything).The team consists of James, who initiates the operation after seeing images of what appears to be his lost sister in one of the videos, and his close friends Peter, Ashley and Lisa - a film student who knows her way around the tech. They are accompanied by two guides as well, and even though few of these people struck me as engaging and their chemistry felt authentic only at certain times, I appreciate that Adam Wingard cast mostly unknown actors for the sake of just that: authenticity.
blair-witch
If I know my film critics and movie-goers, I know that people will complain that this movie's a retread of its predecessor in more ways than three, even though it does have some additions that come along with the more modern setting (using so many different types of cameras allows for more varied shots, for example). Somewhat unfortunately, this comes along with a typical, contrived explanation as to why the characters can't call for help via their smartphones when they predictably become lost and horrific things start happening around them as they lose trust in one another. It would have made sense if they all had the iPhone 8 - Apple's latest innovation where the ability to make phone calls has been removed so as to improve the phone's performance and drain more battery life.Another notable difference is that this one is more in-your-face with its scares. The horror of the original wasn't so much about supernatural beings as it was about getting lost in an unknown place and hearing inexplicable sounds far away; it was based on fears that are intrinsic to most all human beings. The sequel, on the other hand, makes it sound as if our heroes are being chased by the Smoke Monster from Lost - at least when they're not busy jumping at nothing and screaming for a bit, not entirely unlike the sort of people who usually attend movies like this in the theater.But even if you aren't that squeamish, there may yet be parts of this movie that are effective, claustrophobic and eerie enough for you and your friends to be satisfied. As for me, I feel that this movie couldn't have come out at a less opportune time. Found-footage filmmaking appears to be a rapidly dying trend (finally) and I wouldn't be surprised if The Visit and Paranormal Activity 5 were collectively the last straw for most horror movie fans. Maybe Hollywood should try their hand at making sci-fi horror-mysteries á la 80s era Spielberg and Carpenter that star little kids who know things that the adults don't? Those are all the rage now, apparently.I was torn but I'm going to go with a thumbs-down on this one. However, that's not to say that it doesn't have its moments. If you want to watch it on home video with some friends during a horror movie night, I won't object. I might suggestively wave around my copy of Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead and see if you change your mind, but that's about it."

" Rubbish
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,1,"A movie where 99% of the ""scares"" are just jumps made by people running up to the camera and calling out to other people. It delivers nothing of substance, there is no real setup or payoff. The plot can be roughly summed up in a single sentence : some annoying teenagers go into a forest and after stumbling in a circle are no longer in a condition to stumble, or anything else. There is no sign of a blair, nor a witch.You see nothing. Literally bupkiss; there are zero frightening things visible at any time, in any form. There are lots of cameras, cameras in hands, cameras in ears, even a camera on a flying pig, but they are inexplicably pointed in all directions other than whence the scary things arrive. If per chance you are mortified at the thought of trees at night illuminated by flashlights, then oh boy, a horror tour-de-force awaits, but for the rest of you, prepare for disappointment. I endured to the end in the hope that maybe an angry bear would stray onto set and maul someone, even a crew member off-camera, or there'd be a drunken hunting accident of some sort, but no, the movie ends when the last camcorder runs out of battery power, and that's it. What complete and utter sewage."

",2020-01-22 00:00:00,4,"The Blair Witch Project was absolute genius: original concept, brilliant marketing, flawless execution. After that, everyone tried to rip it off, and we're now buried in mediocre ""found footage"" movies. Now we've got one more. Meh.James, the brother of Heather in the original finds a video on YouTube that convinces him his sister is still alive, and he heads toward Blair, friends in tow and cameras in hand. Yada, yada, yada, you know where it's going. Could I really spoil it even if I tried?The thing that made made the original work was the slow burn. They really sell the amateur documentary thing, and the tease out the growing feeling of dread little by little. This one goes too hard too early, and from that point, you just ride it out and wait for the inevitable conclusion.There are also a lot of technical problems. They frequently forget this is supposed to be ""found footage"" and add shots that couldn't possibly have come from one of the cameras. There's also the sound. I kept hitting the volume on the remote. I'd have to crank it up to hear them talk, only to get totally blasted at the next jump scene.So... worth watching if it's free and there's nothing else on, but definitely not memorable."
" Headache
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,1,This movie sucked and gave me a headache from all the yelling and unnecessary yelling. Just an all around dumb movie
" My Soul Went Off!
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,8,"Blair Witch oh my god, the story follows 1st blair witch after many years her brother goes to look for her to find her, 1st one was soul catcher 2nd one was so bad 3rd one was horrific as 1st, get ready to go into the woods, believe me or not you will be there with them its found footage movie so just be aware of what you are gonna watch, i enjoyed this one so much it is as good as first, my soul was rotten till i finished it i was just catching my breath i couldn't breath, the story is interesting to be discovered but it just doesn't do it Whats behind the woods?, after 3 movies we don't have much info about what we are dealing with, i couldn't relax throughout the movie i was so worried what am i gonna see next on my screen, the movie mainly takes at night and the soundtrack is so horrific you are just gonna expect bad things to happen, you will be haunted by the witch, its really stressful, basically the movie is like a remake to the 1st one, i hope there will be another a prequel to discover the real story in the woods that will be intresting, highly recommended but take care of your soul, 8/10⭐"
" Worst protagonist ever
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,1,"Literally could not imagine a more unlikeable, unrelatable, useless, annoying main character ever."
" If you liked The Blair Witch Project...
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,1,"If you liked the ground-breaking originality of the original, then you'll love Blair Witch... because it is almost exactly the same movie, but with more characters, worse actors, and no originality. And there is also amazing found footage camera-facing conversation scenes, as if they were wearing GoPro's strapped to their foreheads, but they aren't actually wearing them. It's amazing!"
" A good different
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,7,"I like this movie because i was originally terrified of the Original back in 1999. This one goes to show and all the speculation that the original movie caused because everyone was questioning whether it was real or not. As for this one it has the same feel but i believe Blair Witch goes more into detail and has more scare factors to it. I saw this movie in theaters when it came out. I'm glad i did because i wasn't disappointed. If you're trying to decide on to watch this one. I would say just do it. It's similar in some way. Of course getting lost, and thinking they're going in complete circles but the end is surprisingly different. Nothing i would've ever expected. Plan on watching this again sometime soon. But i enjoyed it."
" Startle but no scare
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,2,"This movie, with such great potential to build upon the first movie, completely misses the mark. Instead of a psychological thrill ride, it's a boring, mostly plotless drudge punctuated by meaningless startle effects. Meh..."
" Still Stupid
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,5,"This movie was ever so slightly better than the Orginal, mainly due to the way it was filmed, which makes it easier to watch, but the characters are still as stupid as ever, and the plot relies on scares that make absolutely no sense. you never REALLY see anything happin, its all set up in a way to make it appear to have, such as the stick figures. so in a way its creepy , but over all, its just feels like a load of bull krap."
" Being totally scripted is already a huge backlash from the original
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,3,"This motion picture wants to extend the original story in its own way that might be interesting for some, but overall it is just a lazy rehash of other movies' ideas.The main issue is already apparent from the first minutes: It doesn't make the same effort to put these actors in a desperate situation in order to revoke real emotions to all the happenings this film includes. The dialogues are forced and most of times without any soul, any evolution. The interactions between the characters are also unrealistic and non-convincing. It is understandable in a way because many things here are supernatural and needed post-production, like special effects and such, so it would be difficult for the actors to react on things in real time... still that would be the real challenge for the creators to figure it out. That would be the real Blair Witch sequel.And many s**t will happen in that forest, oh boi, many... just you don't know why, or where some of the ideas came from, how they have anything to do with all this story... like... flying tents, a deep wound in the leg that gets worse and is obviously a witchery thing, but in the end the idea of use this plot just kinda feel neglected as they had no idea what to do with it. It's like they held the ""HOW TO MAKE A FOUND FOOTAGE HORROR MOVIE"" guide book and followed many points from it but didn't figure out how to glue these ideas together. Not to mention some of these are seemingly stolen, or at least been already seen in other films. The neverending night plotline is for example used in Grave Encounters, an actually really well working found footage horror movie. The whole look of that monster (which is probably the witch, I guess) is also from REC/Grave Encounters. The wound thing is probably from some zombie movie with which they couldn't do anything... seriously, it had no function... at all... really... barely...However there are things I kinda liked. When one of them was marked with a voodooish figurine and someone broke it the marked one was also killed in the same way in that right moment. This might be a totally misunderstanding what the real function of these figurines are it at least gave a chilling moment to this whole nonsense storyline. The relative timelapse is also an intriguing plot element that should have been used at least a bit differently from Grave Encounters. If they really wanted to make some connections to the Original movie they could have easily make daytimes much shorter than nights, and bam, it is already more unique, and appeals more to realism standpoints.The most annoying thing in this film that it wanted to scare with ""jump scares"", which by the way weren't used one time in the original - and that is admirable - but this sequel end up using every horror cliché tools that have been in use for decades now. And there is nothing worse when the jump scares are done badly as they are already cheap narrative tools but doing it badly is even much worse.It's indeed hard to make something new today, especially in this ""found footage"" subgenre... but if the intentions aren't clear then the ending product will also end up with the same overall ""not clear"" effect. But if they wanted to pull off one more skin of this horse, then they accomplished it with a mindnumbingly average product. If they really wanted to emerge this franchise onto a higher level (which I highly doubt) then they are way off.Nonetheless not the worst found footage horror I have ever seen."
" Disappointed
",2019-09-18 00:00:00,4,This movie did not suck. It was very well made and the special effects were awesome. The SOUND did not work as well as the old movie. The old one had REAL sounds of trees falling. This one you could tell it was added in. There's a lot of unnecessary jump scares but whatever. I don't hate it but it does not compare to the original in scares. The old one made my heart BEAT and I was actually scared. This new one was like oh dumb characters oh bad acting. 4 stars not awful.
" I, for one, enjoyed this movie
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,8,"I remember when the first movie came out, how awesome is was. Truly one of a kind. This one tries SOME new things, but not many. However, I enjoyed it. I really liked the last 20 or so minutes, how they played with time.
Perfect? No.
Watchable? Of course!"
" I'd rather go to the Dentist than watch this again
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,3,"I gave it 3 Stars just so I don't feel so bad about losing the last hour & 1/2 of my life.
The original Blair Witch Project allowed you to get to know the personalities & character traits of the cast, which allows you to be personally invested into caring about the outcome of each person. Although you want all to come out safely, some you come to like and others you dislike, therefore you care for each individual differently. This movie makes all the characters unlikable, none of their relationships seem real and lack any kind of chemistry whatsoever. It's clear whom is with whom but you can tell they're just actors and you're not brought into the moment, you can tell you're watching a movie. Not a good one at that.
The cheap loud jump scares are too frequent, annoying and not well thought out. There was way too much jumping between characters and none of the scenes made sense with the timing of things, the movie did not develop into a plot, it developed into an ending that was ridiculous and although they tried very hard, it was predictable and silly. You were never given enough time in each scene to get scared, as soon as they attempted to scare you, they didn't allow it to develop. rather they switched scenes again and took you right out of the moment.
Rather than watch this movie, grab some pliers, yank out a Molar & head to the Dentist...even with laughing gas, you won't laugh as hard as you did at the movie."
" As boring as the original...
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,5,"Ok, well maybe a bit less boring. There were a few moments of something happening, which is more than I can say for the first. The first is way overrated, and I thought this might have some improvement...but it doesn't really. I've seen worse, but honestly, I think I could make a better movie..."
" Bubble gum fare. A free headache though
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,2,"This is even worse than the first one. A low budget, cheesy attempt at capitalizing on the first movie. God awful movie that utilizes, hold on to your hats folks, young adults running and screaming in the dark woods while you see nothing from a shaking, headache inducing, camera. Novel idea. I couldn't even finish it, just wasn't worth it"
" Just as disappointing as the original

" The sequel the original deserves.
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,8,"Ok, loved the original.... I watched it when it was released as 'real footage' and the premise blew my mind. Let's for now forget the sequel 'Book of shadows' ever existed. And with it forget the negative reviews, this is a great and atmospheric follow up, yes it's got a larger budget, but it's faithful to the original, and of course it 'steps things up'...... Give it an open minded view and enjoy."

",2019-09-01 00:00:00,8,"If you liked ""The Blair Witch Project"" back in 90s, you are going to love the ""Blair Witch"" sequel (2016). It's 2014, 20 years after the 1994 ""The Blair Witch Project"" footage was found and the brother of lost Heather is in search of her. 1,5hour of shaken cameras and scared friends running in the woods. Instead of VHS recording, now you will watch what happened to her brother back in 2014 through found DVD & memory discs' footage - even a drone was used as part of this footage. Screaming again out in dark woods!"
" Why?
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,1,"One of the most pointless pieces of garbage ever. This is not a Blair Witch sequel, is just your typical bad found footage ""horror"" movie, made by a corporation that doesn't have any more series to throw at stupid audiences, so it decides to make a cashgrab taking to name to a beloved film. 0/10 Fuh you Lionsgate."
" Better than Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,7,"Blair Witch is surprisingly, scarier and funny. In my opinion, this film is much better than Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2..."
" Irrelevant
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,3,"If there's one thing I can give ""Blair Witch"" credit for, is that it makes everyone appreciate the original ""Blair Witch Project"" even more. It all looked so easy, didn't it? Just throw a cast of unknowns into the woods with consumer-grade cameras, then have them hear strange noises and run a bunch of times. There, your movie's done. If only it was so simple...The thing this sequel/remake/reboot/cash-in misses so dearly is any sense of dread. The original was compelling because there was just something off right from the start, a creepy atmosphere that made you fear for the character's fates. We just hadn't seen anything like that before, and furthermore it had actors that improvised actual lines instead of just yelling character names to infinity. I swear: if you drink anytime these people shout the name of a missing (read: dead) character, you'll legit get alcohol poisoning. Which is only marginally more unpleasant than seeing this movie all the way through, come to think about it.Maybe it's just hard to shock people at this point, even for a generally talented filmmaker like Adam Wingard (""You're Next"" was pretty great). How many jump scares did the original have? Barely any, because there was no need. The situation was scary enough as it was. This movie constantly uses jump-scares as a band aid, because it has so little else going on. Lightning is simply not going to strike twice. If you're just going to make a bland rip-off of ""Paranormal Activity"", let this franchise die with a little dignity.This is actually worse than the universally panned ""Blair Witch 2"", a sequel that was churned out in less than a year after the unexpected success of the original. At least that movie was something entirely different (maybe a bit TOO different). This just feels like the work of people who saw the first movie, then remade it without actually understanding why it worked so well in the first place. I couldn't wait for these people to die, and that's rarely a good thing when you're trying to make intense psychological horror."

" my notes
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,5,"Overall this was a pretty entertaining throw-away horror flick. but if you think about it for a minute, it has a lot of issues. the false jump scares were ridiculous. i kept noticing it. one time the girl screamed loudly to cause the jump scare, but it's not possible that the voice came from her. it was just loud and ghost-y to scare the audience. the additional technology, like drones and head cams, was intriguing, but really went no where and was not utilized later (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
and the ""twist"" ending was absolutely ridiculous and makes no sense. it's the worst possible time travel paradox i've experienced. somehow the tape went back in time. after someone edited all the different footage and posted it on youtube."

" A petty attempt to follow the legacy of the original.
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,6,"All fans of the horror genre have heard about how special the original Blair Witch movie was, being the movie that started the popularity and gave life to the fake documentary genre and at the same time using fantastic marketing techniques through the internet. Leaving a mark on the history of horror movies. I didn't need any sequel, no reboot or remake, it was excellent as an independent film, but of course, there always have to be sequels in this business. And the great majority of the times they are mediocre sequels.However, despite being a bad sequel, it had certain prevalent points that at least make it ''entertaining'' to kill time on a lonely night. The development itself takes a light and attractive step, the sound design is fantastic (although exaggerated with the use of screams), the practical effects are used again, and the end is probably the best part of the movie, although not as good as the original.Blair Witch follows in the same footsteps. Falling into each of the cliches of the genre, presenting us with unnecessary analysis and exposure of events and relying heavily on scares rather than atmosphere and psychological horror (which is why the former was so successful at scaring). Full of widely used techniques and soft drinks, it is another example of the curse of the aftermath. Once again, we end up with another classic example of mediocre sequel. I can probably only recommend the movie to non-demanding fans of the genre or people with low expectations, it's not a complete waste of time, but it's not worth it that much either."
" Better than the first.

",2019-04-15 00:00:00,7,"To many old tricks and borrowed, stolen, reused, over used. etc. nicely done though. if no others before it, this would be top notch. even then, the story telling is predictable even if at times, confusing. to many past events ignored while present events are affected by them. once dead bad guy shows up ok and then not treated as bad guy or as dead. hrmmm. not ok. then falling on original story line as if you saw it, were graded and the home work handed back as incomplete. if not for the obvious errors, and the lack of effort to work them out, this would have been an all time classic."
" it's the definition of so-so.
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,5,"This movie was very forgettable. It does feel very scripted so the whole hoax aspect, even if you willingly suspend disbelief, isn't a possibility here.It nicely takes us back into the mystery and tries to expand on the world and only raises more questions in the process (obviously this is a good thing).But I feel that while some horror sequels can be really good, BW Project is a movie that gains a lot from just being a thing by itself. Movies are usually autonomous to any derivative works but this is just chewable horror horror with nothing much to hate on but nothing much to love either."
" A belated rehash
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,4,"An American horror; A story about twenty years passing since the victims of a disappearance in the woods in Maryland, with a man still wondering what happened to his sister. When he discovers eerie internet footage of someone resembling her, he and three friends set out to investigate, taking along cameras to document their search. This found-footage supernatural film is a sequel to the eerie and genuinely chilling ""The Blair Witch Project"" released in 1999. Predictably there are effective jump scares and the usual devices such as loud noises to creates some foreboding and mystery, but there is nothing new on offer but gimmicks. Shaky camerawork is overused, mainly to cover up for lack of inventiveness or character building. Tension drains from the sequences and viewers of the original film are likely to get disappointed and feel cheated at no substantial 'big reveal'."
" Should have listened to everyone else
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,2,At home sick and stumbled upon this wee pile of garbage on Netflix. Currently halfway through. Contrived. Not frightening. Poor dialogue. Bad set ups. Crap transitions. Even the sound effects are out of place. The acting by the 2 male leads is a particularly special brand of awful. A student film at best. Not even sure I'll get through it.
" Not the Blair Witch
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,6,"This movie started great. Solid premise, good characters, and it was being pretty faithful to the original movie, which made the first half of this movie good. The scares in the movie are pretty effective and consistent throughout and the story doesn't have very many holes in it. But then the second half is where it started falling, and just kept falling. What made the second half not work is that it kept adding to the lore, expanding on it, making new rules for the Blair witch, and breaking those rules. A big part of what made the original good was the mystery aspect to the witch herself, how she works, why she does what she does, heck, you could even argue that there's no solid evidence that the monster in The Blair Witch Project is the Blair witch at all. It could be a number of different entities. But that's the original. In this film, too much gets explained. You even see the Blair witch multiple times, and part of what made the original good is that you never see her. As soon as she began manifesting these powers that were never established as ones she possessed, and you see her jumping out to scare the characters, it doesn't feel like a Blair Witch movie anymore. Also, the ending was very drawn out. What was about a 13 minute sequence in the house should have been much shorter. But still worth seeing once."
" Tedious and Loud
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,1,"I can only imagine any positive reviews here are from family/friends of people who worked on this production. Or I am REALLY out of touch with how low standards are when you're too young to have seen enough movies to know what's good. Like all the 1-star (honest) reviews point out, this movie was nothing but shaky-cam high-pitched screaming in the dark. Over, and over, and over. Not even screaming anything interesting -- just the names of other characters. Over, and over, and over. But somehow the moments when they paused from that were even more boring. Or maybe it was just boring in different ways: how do you prefer your boring: eye-rollingly cliché'd conversation? Or crank-the-volume-down repetitive shrieking for minutes at a stretch? Look, I dunno why anyone would knowingly watch this if you know what to expect, but... just so you know what to expect, that's about it. Boring dialogue, and boring repetitive shrieking in the dark. PS oh man, the characters are aggressively stupid. But still somehow, in ways that are really boring."
" A Decade Too Late, But Still Enjoyable
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,6,"If you attempt to recreate a surprise hit 17 years after the surprise has worn off in the woods and no one is around to notice about, does it count as a sequel?Blair Witch (2016) is the attempted revival of the long-dormant Blair Witch ""franchise"" that includes one arguably groundbreaking film and an extremely crappy sequel that has rightfully been completely ignored in this new entry. Directed by Andrew Wingard of The Guest and You're Next fame, it emulates the first film's distinct style but doesn't really allow Wingard any chance to get to his trademark dark humor (though there is a KPG reference). While Blair Witch isn't quite as good as The Blair Witch Project, it makes Blair Witch 2: Book Of Shadows look like even more of a flaming pile of garbage.If you have any idea of what The Blair Witch Project is then you know the drill here. In 2014 a group of people go into the woods to film a documentary about a dude looking for his long-lost sister (the girl from The Blair Witch Project) and run afoul of the titular Blair Witch themselves. 90 minutes of loud noises and ""this is freaking me out, man"" and our group of 6 mildly unlikable early-20s people all end up having to deal with the Witch in their own ways. Maybe in 10 years they'll make a film about searching for the cast of this one.While not a mediocre film, Blair Witch is just a tad too predictable to elevate it to the truly great category. It adds a couple of things to the mythology but doesn't really do much with it. I'll put it like this: if you've seen The Blair Witch Project you basically know exactly what will happen here - albeit with more cameras. If you haven't seen The Blair Witch Project you might actually appreciate this film more as a unique experience...which is incredibly odd to say about a sequel. It straddles that line between good and mediocre; genre fans will like it, other people will probably find it lacking.Just to start off I'll not knock this film for casting a some pseudo-known actors in our group of ""totally real people."" Callie Hernandez as the lead girl Lisa is only known to psychopaths like myself you have seen most of her filmography which was released after Blair Witch was filmed (I look forward to Under The Silver Lake!) and the rest are mostly TV and video game actors. Callie Hernandez is fantastic here and really does pull off the terrified look near the end of the film of a woman who has been broken by fear - and Hernandez is not afraid to look completely wrecked for this role! I really hope more films can utilize Hernandez's raw, intense talents...now if only they can somehow put her and Jane Levy together in Don't Breathe 2...a horror fan can dream! The other performances range from good to feeling at times like the actors are desperately attempting to make scripted performances look like natural dialogue. Yes this film was completely scripted for some reason I don't understand. Additionally I think the film might have been stronger if it cut out the ""douchebag best friend and his girlfriend"" who add very little beyond a higher body count and are the least believable of the group.Blair Witch does actually have some effective horror scenes; it just takes a while to get to. It only really becomes a horror film in the last half, and it hits that horror part like a sprinter bolting off the line at the sound of the gun. There's not much slow-building atmosphere here - once night falls it just goes full-horror-mode and doesn't look back. See, the Blair Witch spends about 24 hours tormenting our heroes, and then just kills the crap out of them. There's a good bit near the end when our heroes are just trapped in the woods as they become more and more terrifying and it is quite nice to see a film where the woods are actually so pitch black that a monster might be a few feet away but you'd never see it. The ""monster"" design is suitably scary and the fleeting glimpses we have of it are enough to make you be afraid of camping overnight anywhere near Maryland. The ending segment in the house is easily the best part of this film because you really believe that these are people running through a cursed, rotting house while freaking out because they know they about to die.It's just sad that before the monster shows up we're meant to be afraid people turning around or tripping on a branch. There are way too many jump scares (usually with loud, distorted noises) early in this film that really distract from any attempt to build up atmosphere. The fuzzy figure we can barely make out is far more visceral than the stereotypical girl who can't hear their friend behind them jump-scare. I hope you like people spinning their camera around and somehow not hearing people walking behind them ...which oddly our lead girl does actually point out when she says ""will everyone would stop doing that"" after the second turn-aroung-jump-scare in 20 seconds.Blair Witch uses modern tech such as headmounted cameras and drones to create a ""current day"" iteration of the classic found-footage horror genre that the original The Blair Witch Project started - all of which have amazing battery lives. In early scenes there are somewhere around 8-10 active cameras in the group between the mounted, handheld and head ones, with constant editing between them done by whoever found this ""totally real"" footage. This at least feels believable for how something like this might have been shot today given that this is supposed to be a ""documentary"" crew, but it has its drawbacks. All these cameras and cuts make it feel less like found-footage and more like ""let's make a modern movie but with POV shots"" - POV shots that are way too perfectly framed for someone who is just casually wearing a camera on their ear and sometimes is covered with hair. Seriously, take a shot when a ""POV"" shot is wildly off where the character in the scene is really looking as established by the other characters' POV. Say what you want about the original The Blair Witch Project but it at least had the feeling of people going into the woods with a crappy camera. Near the end when we get longer shots as our heroes dwindle it becomes far more effective. I just don't know why they edited Blair Witch like a standard movie because all it does is destroy the illusion of ""this really happened"" that The Blair Witch Project attempted to create.Blair Witch doesn't try reinvent the wheel with a franchise that was almost murdered by the first sequel made at the height of the hype. A surprise hit almost two decades ago didn't really need an additional entry that just recreates the first film - though if it was released a few years after The Blair Witch Project it probably would have done really well at the box office. Sadly the found-footage genre has been overdone in the years since then with later Paranormal Activity films destroying its charm, which undoubtedly hurt Blair Witch's box office performance. It's a good film by itself; it just suffers from being an imitation of a great one. If you can stomach a bad first half of a film you will be treated to a delightful horror experience with lots of tension and dread - albeit formulaic if you had seen the first film. I think the film would have been stronger if they cut out a couple of characters and left out the overused jump scares in the first half, but it's still probably the best story about the Blair Witch we could have hoped for. Horror fans will likely enjoy Blair Witch as a tense, dark and at times terrifying experience but be left feeling like this is a film that should have been made 10 years ago."

" TOO LOUD!!!!
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,5,"Blair Witch a decent follow up to the original, but it was ruined by the incredibly loud audio and bright lighting. In the original the cracks and noises they heard at night were quiet, and they often they would strain to hear them. In this film the noises were so loud that it took away from the slow build intensity and was kind of corny. The bright lighting was a bit much. It lost the claustrophobic feeling of the original as they peered off into the dark woods, barely able to see 15 to 20 foot in front of them. I did really like the continuous night time, and time manipulation that was added to BW. A decent found footage film. Looking forward to another sequel."
" Jumpy it is
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,7,"So why all the bad reviews?...I watched this for the first time tonight and it was ok...I could have been so critical bearing in mind the original was my first ever DVD that I purchased back in the day and loved that but no I always take every film on it's own merits. Be it an entirely new stand alone film or a remake I look at every angle.The film itself had a slasher style take on it but minus the gore apart from the odd bit. The story was good and the group of youngsters entering a forest to find out what happened to one of theirs sister's was creepy.Contradiction from me would be the amount of jump scares and the constant screaming of a members name when they wander off, but that doesn't really make it a bad movie.Any true horror fan would like This, take it on it's own merits and stand alone and it keeps you entertained."
" I dug it..
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,8,Its exactly what you would expect for a sequel almost 20 years later. They stuck to the formula (almost too closely) but it served its purpose. Not as bad as the reviews depict.
" Never should have been made
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,3,"In 1999, moviegoers were caught by surprise when the low-budget found footage film 'The Blair Witch Project' hit theaters. While 'Project' caught fire and sparked a whole new genre of horror thrillers, many have unsuccessfully tried to recapture the original's success. 2016's 'Blair Witch' is a prime example.As everyone knows, sequels rarely improve on their predecessors, and in this case, it's not even a close call. 'Blair Witch' is everything the original is not. While things seem pretty similar on the surface (college-aged kids film their expedition in the Black Woods of Maryland), this one comes off as a complete rip-off and, despite having a 17-year advantage in terms of technology, it doesn't feel fresh at all.The no-name cast is nothing to write home about, but they aren't offensive, either. No one is memorable, unlike the crew that had audiences gripping their seats years before. The only cool thing about 'Blair Witch' is the fact that there are many references to the original, and similar locations (like Coffin Rock and Rustin Parr's house) are shown. But one thing that can't be denied is the fact that this film is just not that scary. Sure, there are a few scenes that theoretically could send chills down your spine, but they are executed so poorly. And if a horror film doesn't deliver in the scares department, what does it deliver?Most audiences had an idea that 'Blair Witch' would be underwhelming, as the film suffered at the box office. It's unlikely that will convince studios to try to mess with this franchise further."
" Garbage remake parading as a sequel
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,1,"Remember when movies had originality? Before the massive quality decline in Hollywood from the mid-2000's, the first Blair Witch Project came along and blew the hinges off standard horror/suspense movie convention. It did so with such ridiculous ease, through audacious simplicity and originality.But now we're in a generation which sees every 'new' movie as a soulless sequel or heartless remake,Hollywood's insatiable greed gave the world an immediate terrible sequel which completely ignored why the Blair Witch was so brilliant, and in doing so, pretty much killed off any further development (cashing in) on the franchise.But we're in an era now where EVERY profitable franchise is being resurrected with a new lick of CGI paint, and that's why they've took another stab at Blair Witch... and they've failed miserably yet again.The only reason it is better than the first sequel is because this is basically a remake of the original, albeit with too much gloss and visual effects, and an ultra-annoying cast. At the end of this movie, you even see the Blair Witch - who they've decided to depict as a giant stick-man (woman). It's the equivalent of Judge Dredd removing his mask - it shouldn't be done.As others have said, this movie completely misunderstands why the Blair Witch Project was so brilliant. I guess they'll bury it for another five to ten years then spring another nostalgia-soaked 'sequel' trick on us."
" Quite scary
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,7,"Watched this a few days ago so not entirely fresh in my mind, other than to say that I thought it was a pretty decent follow up to the original Blair Witch Project (forget that awful sequel!). Seems to be a lot of hate and only 5/10 current score but it kept me engaged throughout, had decent acting/production values and, as a veteran of over 35 years of watching horror movies, I'm not afraid to admit that I found it pretty scary at times. And not many films do that."
" Don't waste your time

",2018-10-05 00:00:00,7,"Is this movie the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life? No. Is that what anyone is thinking it might be when they go to watch it? I hope not. Look, at the end of the day, this is an updated Blair Witch Project, and in my opinion, it's way better than the first one. It's a found footage type movie, so of course there's lots of camera movement and gasping and running through the forest (people complaining about that might as well go watch Halloween and complain that the killer never takes his mask off). All in all, I thought this was a pretty good scary movie. You actually get to see the witch in this one, which was one of my biggest complaints about the 1999 version. Lots more building in this one (instead of just ""ominous"" piles of rocks), and I'd much rather watch this one again than the original."

" An insult to the original.
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,3,"I'm really disappointed. The original makes a brilliant film out of nothing. This throws everything at you (including a giant CGI witch/monster) yet overal it's rubbish. Terrible acting from most of the cast except ""Lisa"", terrible characters and terrible story. Even the huge growling, rumbling, shrieking sound effects didn't have a patch on the giggling distant children of the first film.Only positives I can give we're a few little tidbits of story about the witch and the ""curse"" why the original killer did what he did. Not quite answered but some more to chew on. Sadly that's not enough to salvage this crud. I preferred the Bigfoot film made by the Blair Witch Project Director 'Exists'. Miles better than this though still a B-movie. Ah well."
" Awesome and mindblowing horror.
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,8,"It is not as bad as others ae saying actually its good but not like original balir witch. But they cant make same movie again. And ppl complaint about shaking camera but thats the good part about movie thats what makes it better and unique than other movies. Its the part of concept and its the thing that makes it more scary. If u are making video with camera in that horror of course its normal for camera to shake and its good.It was good movie but old is gold and thats true. In this somwhere we didnt got the attachments with characters as we did in original. But overall movie is excellent and u will like if u watch it in night with lights off, otherwise if u r watching horro and thriller movies in daylight and complain bout horror movies of courru will not like it and only will decrease imdb rating of such good movies"
" MTV Thug Version
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,1,"This is the MTV Hip Hop version of the original movie. Not original at all. It's crap. Bad acting, bad script, bad movie, bad idea all around. Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows was better than this turd. And we all know how bad THAT was."
" Second viewing.
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,5,"After I watched this movie the first time I rated it a 6 as I found it mildly entertaining. I recently watched it again and couldn't help but notice cheap jump scare after cheap jump scare. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, they used the same type of unfulfilling shock tactic 3 times in succession. THREE TIMES! I am of course discussing how it seems to be totally possible for someone to be able to walk up to another character, stepping on all those woodsy twigs and leaves and wotnot, and not be heard AT ALL until said someone is practically on top of the other person. Cheap and nasty thrills for the sake of nothing... NOTHING! I've since reevaluated my rating to a 5."

",2018-06-24 00:00:00,2,"SPOILER: You can't watch this pile of crap without groaning and wondering just where did these people who gave it 10 out of 10 crawl out from. They worked on it perhaps? They've never seen a movie before? Something is obviously wrong with them in any case.Anyway, the original hooked me, I was genuinely creeped right out back then. To compare this pos to the original is a joke. Ridiculous decisions, ridiculous reason for even going to look for this missing for 17 years sister and knowing how the first trip went, they go in without a weapon of any kind. Maybe they thought yelling each other's names in an endless display of stupidity would scare the boogies away. It doesn't and then the last 10 minutes or so just sink it even further by suggesting *spoiler* that aliens did it. Omg are you serious? 
I gave it 2 for the production-nothing else. What crap."
" ""Blair Witch"" (2016)- A contrary opinion.
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,8,"""The Blair Witch Project"" has remained a beloved if not divisive film since its initial release nearly twenty years ago. One of the earliest mainstream films to adopt the ""found footage"" format, ""The Blair Witch Project"" became one of the most acclaimed and profitable releases of its time, quickly generating a mass following and near-endless praise. And while the initial hype was dulled by an ambitious but ultimately misaimed sequel in 2000's ""Book of Shadows"", the love many have for that original film still rung true, and fans waited eagerly for a proper sequel. A sequel that would be released in 2016- ""Blair Witch,"" directed by Adam Wingard.The film's production was kept in a death-grip of secrecy, with false trailers and titles swirling. Nobody knew a new film was even being made. And upon release in the festival circuit, it seemed like audiences finally got a winning follow-up. Word-of-mouth was fantastic, with many horror publications boasting of strong feedback while giving the films high marks in their own reviews. And then it was released to the public... and it crashed and burned. The response was pure venom and bile. Audiences hated it. Critics crucified it. And it looked like another dud for the franchise.But was it really that bad? I don't think so at all.Yes, it's one of those wonderful times where I get to play the contrarian card, because sue me... I really enjoyed ""Blair Witch,"" and to me... this was the sequel I was looking for all these years.In 2014, James Donahue, brother of original ""Blair Witch Project"" director Heather, discovers a YouTube video purportedly taken in the same mysterious house where his sister vanished twenty years ago. Footage that appears to show a woman fleeing from mysterious, seemingly supernatural forces. Still haunted by Heather's disappearance, James assembles a group of friends and sets off into the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland, to see if he can find any trace of what happened to her...The great joy of ""Blair Witch"" lies in how obviously it is a loving tribute to that outstanding first film, though updated and appropriately amped up for modern tastes. It's what the first film was, only bigger, zanier and crazier... and arguably all the more ""fun"" for it. Albeit fun in the sort-of way where you find yourself giggling madly in anticipation of the next big jump or set-piece. It's a roller-coaster of a follow-up that still feels true to its more humble origins thanks to its callbacks, format and keen use of atmosphere, while adding in new twists and turns to keep the material fresh.The general malign directed towards the film often lays in people feeling that in some way it fundamentally went against what worked so well about the original. It wasn't as subtle. It's not quite as clever. It showed too much. And yes, that is true. But I'd argue that given the passage of time and the intimate knowledge that people have regarding what came before... it's better for this film to do those things that drive the hardcore fans crazy. It's better for it to be blatant. It's better for it to be more ""wild"" and less ""frightening."" It's better for it to be over-zealous. Because that's what we'd least suspect. That's what would get us.We've seen ""The Blair Witch Project."" We know why it works. We know that the philosophy of ""less is more"" is what made it a classic. So why would we want to see those same ideas watered down and repackaged? I know how scary it was seeing that original film in 1999 to simply hear Heather screaming ""What is that?!"" while running through the woods. This time... I wanted to see more. I wanted to see a film that threw its hands up, said ""Screw it, we're gonna have fun with this mythology!"" and actually started to give us demented glimpses of what had only been hinted at before. And I got what I wanted.This is a film that needed to be silly and psychotic... and even a bit messy to work.Director Wingard relishes in the atmosphere of the film in the best of ways. This is a stunningly well-choreographed film, from the stellar photography down to some of the most breathtaking sound design I've heard in recent memory. The film really does have impact, and though the scares are oft-cheap, they always feel earned. And I just loved how Wingard and writer Simon Barrett have embellished on what came before. There's some great twists and turns along the journey, and new ideas introduced, such as the Witch's ability to seemingly and permanently extend the night, add a lot to the proceedings.I was also taken with the cast. Stars James Allen McCune, Callie Hernandez, Brandon Scott, Corbin Reid, Wes Robinson and Valorie Curry are all very likable and fun, albeit in somewhat more trope-infused, archetypal roles. McCube and Hernandez have good chemistry and play well off one-another as what are essentially our two leads, while Robinson and Curry are just a blast and a half as geeky dweebs who are a little too obsessed with the Blair Witch legend. They add a cheekiness to the film that I very much liked. Almost like some of the obsessive real-life fans of the original film somehow ended up in the sequel. And though their roles are less defined, Scott and Reid ground the film as a couple of skeptic friends who are along for the ride.It really comes down to this. If you are looking for the original film again, you won't find that here. ""Blair Witch"" is an attempt to re-invigorate a franchise, while doing whatever it can to spook you at every opportunity. And if, like me, you're open to seeing a silly roller-coaster of a sequel, then check it out. It's not a great film. But it is great entertainment. And I'm giving it an 8 out of 10."

Everyone in the theater came away from that movie feeling that we just threw our money away. Low budget camera shooting and NOTHING but sounds when they slept. I will never forget how the audience applauded when the lead girl was finally killed. So annoying and disappointing that even this NEWER version was just as bad, only with more people in it.
I am very glad that I didn't get ripped off and paid to see this.

" A pretty good remake
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,8,"I love the original 1999 Blair With Project film, it is one of the scariest films made in my opinion. The way in which they made that film was very good, it was pretty simple, yet effective. This one is still very scary and an effective horror film. I enjoyed it and was actually creeped out by it. They used the a lot of the same techniques with this one that they used in the original. My favorite technique that was used again was the no eerie background music. Silence can be a lot more effective when trying to create a scary atmosphere. it keeps you more on edge and it stokes fear. I also liked the actors, pretty good casting decisions. Some of the scenes were inspired directly from the 1999 film, but they weren't point by point exactly the same. I liked the way they were done, and I liked that they added a couple little glimpses of what we are supposed to be fearing, they didn't show us, just showed a short glimpse of something. I don't know if people just didn't like that they remade this film or why it was very poorly received. I think if you just look at it as a horror film and forget that it's even a remake, you'll enjoy it. 8/10 for Blair With."

The only reason to watch this is if you literally have time to kill, and no better options.The found-footage idea is dead. There were a few good ones out there, but it got old quick, and no body wants it anymore. Please stop..."
" One of those movies where you just can't look away.
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,5,"I originally reviewed this movie and gave it a 2 but I've since rewatched it several times and bumped up the rating. For some reason, this movie is addictive - I'm not sure why. Yes, the movie is different from the original, but that was 17 years ago. The woods look different, the house where Rustin Parr lived looks different (VERY different, I might add), and there is a lot more technology used. We are not shown the reason why the witch can manipulate the darkness. Maybe that's why I keep watching it? To figure it out? Regardless, it will never replace the original for me and I don't think it is meant to."
" Should Have Left Off With Book of Shadows
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,1,"After hearing that the movie filming under the name of 'The Woods' was really Blair Witch, I was very excited to see it. I loved The Blair Witch Project and I even love it's sequel, Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. Despite it's generally poor reception Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 was a decent enough follow-up to The Blair Witch Project and at least tried to do something different. I think it would have been better received if the studio hadn't interfered with the cut-in shots of them running through the woods throughout, it takes away a bit of the did they/didn't they y the time it gets to the end. It certainly would have left a better legacy than the confused mess that is Blair Witch.It starts out bland and goes downhill from there. The characterizations vary between flat and outright annoying. In a bizarre stroke of laziness the character of Lisa is the only one to even be given a last name. There will probably be unmarked spoilers from here on in because Blair Witch is so confusing that I'm not even sure what would be a spoiler and what would not be.They take all of the mythology from The Blair Witch Project and instead of building on it they strip it, make their own and throw the rest out of the window. Much to the detriment of the movie. Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 at least tried to make a different statement but kept the core mythology intact.Every cliche from every found footage horror movie is certainly on full display here. Annoying personalities that clash? Check. Stupid decisions at every turn? Check. These are common tropes in horror but Blair Witch ratchets them up to eleven.The one thing Blair Witch manages to avoid is the eventual found footage argument about why they keep filming. They get around that by using earcams (that stay remarkably hair-free). Of course that leaves them plenty of time to argue over even stupider stuff. Like their drone. It's established early on that it's useless but when it becomes stuck in a tree it's the end of the world.The camera work is so jerky and choppy that through the second half of Blair Witch it becomes practically incomprehensible. Presumably scary things happen but they go by so quickly that it's hard to even make out what happened. I have a feeling that they intended to use the drone footage more than they actually did. If it was cut, my guess would be because it made theater goers ill. I don't usually have a problem with motion sickness (I was fine in the first Blair Witch) and the drone shots made me a bit queasy. I'd be curious to know if anyone else had a problem with it.A 'creature' appears near the end but it's unclear from the movie whether or not it is the Blair Witch or not. I have heard that on the commentary the directors claim that it is not the Blair Witch and that the clues are in the movie. If anyone figures it out, please let me know. I'm not watching it again to find out. All I could tell from it was that it looked rather like a skinny, mossy Ent.If you want a good found footage horror I'd go back to The Blair Witch Project. It at least had some effort and creativity behind it. Hell, Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 for all of it's faults is great cinema next to the convoluted mess that is Blair Witch."

" An Honest Review
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,1,"It's one of those crap remakes, where they take an original that everyone loves, then they dumb it down to reach the Millennial Generation, and then they make it worse.The original was more psychological and made to seem realistic. This one seemed more like a slasher film. But I guess that is what happens when you start remaking shows to appeal to people that don't want to think at all.In the original, it was really your imagine that created the scares. In this one its made for people with no imagination to run wild and the difference is self apparent.Stay away. The premise just doesn't work for the new generation's tastes."
" Something evils hiding in the woods
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,9,"The Blair Witch Project is one of the most originally scary horror films ever made. A first of its kind, it was a great idea to come up with in the late 90s. The movie went on to become a cult classic loved by many and feared by all. When u watch the movie u can see that there isnt much substance. It is mostly character driven and about how the friends interact. For a director to come and breathe new life into the film with out totally changing or ruining it was no easy feat. You want to respect the original vision while still making a surprising movie and still catering to the loyal fans. The Blair Witch Project did so well because its big on ""what you dont see'..this may seem a little too underwhelming for a new vision of it and it could cause it to fall alongside every other FF movie in recent memory. The best decision here was to have Adam Wingate direct the movie. Wingard is a TRUE Blair Witch Project fan, as you can feel its influence in some of wingard's previous films. Wingard and Eduardo Sanchez both .use rawness to achieve their scares, always giving us something for mature and seasoned horror fans yet sometimes too scary for others. They worked together well on VHS2 and Eduardo said he couldntve asked for a better director to bring The Blair Witch story back to life. Now, Adam Wingard's Blair Witch is very different than the original and it has a truly cinematic feel. You can tell many of the sound effects were made FOR theaters, making it very enjoyable on the big screen. I did not like some of the locations of woods they used in this film though. I liked how the original had many open spaces in the woods where Heather, Josh, and Mike were lost in. It made for a more eerie take on the woods, with bare branches and sketchy looking paths and openings. Adam Wingard used more enclosed woodsy areas, less bare branches, and there wasn't as much arguing as the original. Instead of arguing about 10 different things they should have continuously argued about one or two things, making them seem more important and realistic. I would have preferred more map use than the whole new age technology thing. While there are minor flaws, Adam Wingard maintains that raw Blair Witchy feel. The fear of the unknown is still here, as we still dont know the true origins of the witch. Her story is somewhat told, but only touched upon lightly. I don't necessarily agree with the exposure of the witch towards the end. Maybe she should have still been left to our minds. And I thought they should have done more with the rock piles. Its still one of my favorite horror movies as I am a true Blair Witch fan and Adam Wingard is one of my strongest influences in writing and directing"
" Horror Sequel in 2016: What Did You Expect?
",2017-12-05 00:00:00,10,"I didn't have any expectations for Blair Witch, in fact I went in thinking it looked rather dull and something that would appeal to fans of Saw or perhaps even The Conjuring Universe, which to me, is so completely blown out of proportion in terms of a quality horror. It's an Amityvillew ripoff with a big movie budget with that same dumb looking doll Wan already used in all of his movies! Anyway I digress...The film:The good - A somewhat dedicated cast of actors that were not afraid of getting their hands dirty and were willing to jump and the mud and probably hit pans to startle each other before shoots: they all seemed genuinely nerve wracked and terrified.The time/space bending realm that the film explored was a really cool twistSome really haunting visualsNon-stop horror pretty much throughout the whole movie; like a haunted house ride with the actors that swing chainsaws and whatnotThe time loop that mends with the first film and kind of mind fricks you near the climax.The bad - Too many cameras, devoid of any minimalism. I think if they cut the cameras down to.. say I don't know, 3? This could have been even better than what the original was introducing to the world.The lack of coherent dialogue: why are they screaming their names so much? Stop. Come on, it's silly.The loud thuds and bass wobbles and dubstep noises were reaching and made some moments a lot less effective.Overall: It's not as bad as people say. It's a fun ride. It was creative and packed a punch for the adrenaline junkies of the horror world.The naysayers need to chill and let people decide for themselves whether they like a film or not."
" A thoroughly annoying experience
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,3,"The original 1999 film was a masterclass in fear, suspense, improvisational acting and the power of subtlety. This belated cash grab, on the other hand, is a 90-minute showreel of every terrible found-footage cliché that has ever been used since the dawn of the millennium. It manages to extinguish every single one of its creepy moments - which are few and far-between - with deafening sound effects, weak acting and an everlasting number of pathetic jump-scares that are about as creative as a child running up behind you shouting ""boo"". Sitting through its running time was a thoroughly annoying experience, though its unintentionally hilarious ending had me in stitches."
" Meh
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,6,"Blair witch Meh. The concept and ideas behind this were sound. Pretty much just remake the original film - The Blair Witch Project, but modernize it and did what the original did not and actually showed the freaking Blair Witch. A small part of me wonders if that helped to make the original flick so iconic. Anyway, the new film starts out great.. ends great but OMG the middle of it is boring as sh#t because of the weak character development. The original film is literally three people wondering around in the woods however it develops character relations and etc, etc along the way. It does depend on special effects to tell a story, it let the characters tell the story and connect to the audience in an emotional level. I'm not calling the original Blair Witch Project the greatest film of all time. In fact I would rank it a 7.4 out of 10. Anyway, long story short this film could have been better. Final score - 6/10"
" The Same Old Turkey,Stuffed Only With A Couple New Ideas and a Bunch of Jumpscares.
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,6,"6.1/10 Here we are in 2016, where horror movies have loud noises every 5 seconds and nothing is left to the imagination of the viewer. The movie is okay and will do the job of scaring the mainstream viewer. All subtlety is thrown out the window and the ""Blair Witch myth"" is chopped into big chunks of exposition. It may kinda ruin the ambiguity of the first movie for some people. Some interesting ideas get thrown around, but nothing comes out of them. The first half is a bit boring, but overall not a disastrous experience."
" About 80% as good as the original, just a bit overdone
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,7,"I think the people who lacked the attention spans to ""get"" the original Blair Witch movie are the types rating this one poorly. I will never understand such people. They should stick with standard slasher films that don't require the mind to engage much.I found this film (or video, rather) almost as compelling as the first, even though the technique of making a loud noise at almost every new appearance of a person or thing was overdone and sometimes absurd (there's no need for a crashing sound when a normal person walks up behind you). They could have kept it subtle like the first movie, but it was still a tense film that worked in its own right.Toward the end there was particularly claustrophobic scene that I won't spoil, but it rivaled scenes from ""The Descent"" (2005).My actual rating of this would be 7.5 if the choice was offered."
" Blair Witch review.
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,6,"Blair Witch is a surprisingly effective re-imagining/sequel to the 1999 cultural phenomenon The Blair Witch Project. Directed by Adam Wingard his notorious visual style isn't as quite as prevalent in this film, at-least until the third act when the plot kicks in. For the most part, Blair Witch follows the same structure of its predecessor. Which means large sections of the film are literally treading the same ground, the first hour of the film was incredibly dull.Thankfully the film becomes more engaging when James (James Allen McCune) and Lisa (Callie Hernandez) reach the witches house, whilst in search for James's sister who went missing 20 years earlier. Both actors do a fantastic job, especially Callie Hernandez who carries a-lot of fear and emotion in the final act on her shoulders. They're also accompanied by a couple of friends that aren't even remotely developed, and are essentially there for canon fodder.Over-all the film feels like a wasted opportunity. Large sections of the film were lifeless, I didn't need to see people walking in the woods for an hour doing very little again. However when the final act comes, it does a fantastic job of being atmospheric and genuinely scary. However it was too little too late."
" Throw a camera at a wall while screaming then watch it
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,1,"The first Blair witch had a low budget and was very watchable because the plot was good and the theme was interesting.For this to have a five million dollar budget, all I could think was where did th money go?? Certainly not into production, makeup, screen writing, acting or script. The script is literally scream people's names over aand over. My all time favorite line: "" I hear there are tunnels, like maybe the Underground Railroad went through here or something"" and it just gets WORSE.I couldn't even watch it it was SO boring. If you can watch a woman crawl through dirt with a camera for half An hour, go for it. YOU try to get a plot out of that....Five days of night??? Really?? Just don't even do it."
" not as bad as expected
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,6,"The Blair Witch Project was a successful movie because people thought it was real. Following what we believed were the final moments of that group of teens was enough morbid fascination to plunge deep in the story, see past any mistakes in the ""documentary"" and be contented with bumpy images of people running around the woods at night. From then on, that fascination was over. There were only a few roads the producers could follow if they still wanted to grab the public's attention and, in my opinion, pursuing the ""reality"" angle wasn't one of them after we knew it was all fake.On The Woods, we are sent back to the forest with a group of couples who are hoping to find the house where the events of The Blair Witch Project took place, following a lead on a tape discovered at the root of a tree. One of the guys in the group is Heather's (main character on BwP) brother and he still hopes to find her alive (ok.....).As soon as the night falls things start to get creepy and characters start to panic, leading them to do some really dumb things like running off screaming into the woods, alone, in the dark. Also, I believe some scenes were included in the movie only to increase the sense of unease and/or disgust in the audience, which I considered effective enough, but it's annoying when they have no real development or importance in the plot. I believe this is where most of the bad reviews come from.Anyway, the story develops in an interesting way, we find out more about the Blair Witch and what's going on in that forest, while witnessing the characters' torment as they try to escape.What started off as a bland experience, since it was lacking the reality factor, grew up to be a decent horror movie with some ""tight"" situations that left me gasping for air. The theory to explain it all, presented at the end, didn't disappoint me either. Keep an open mind while watching this and you might be entertained. I'd give it a 6,5 out of 10 rating."
" This is my fault
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,1,"After 15-20 years or so James (James Allen McCune) returns to Blair to locate his sister Heather based on some film he saw on line. He gets a crew, GPS, Walkie Talkies, a drone and two local guides. They get in the woods but it won't let them out and it stays dark so they wouldn't have to spend any money showing you cool stuff or creating special effects. The special effects hit on all the negatives: ground cam, foot cam, sky cam, tree cam, ""what was that"" cam, jerk cam, scream in the dark cam, drag on the ground cam, flashlight fail cam, blurred cam, and panic whine cam. It was all annoying, done before and better. I liked ""Blair Witch 2"" more, even though this sequel makes more sense, it was just done so poorly. Lane (Wes Robinson) was half decent. I expected more from Adam Wingard.Guide: F-word. no sex or nudity"
" Something I can't figure out...
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,1,"I really have nothing else to add about this film than what has already been said - that it is a cheap cash in of every other horror film in the last 10 years, masquerading under the title of an innovative, ground-breaking horror film from the late nineties. The film basically relies on one cheap jump scare; one person looking for another person for 5 minutes, calling their name out to no avail. Everything goes silent then all of a sudden....BAM! The person is right behind them and the audience jumps. Kid's stuff, basically. But why, when these people are walking through the woods, wouldn't they hear the other person walking up behind them? When they can hear a witch cracking sticks from miles away? Did the other person tiptoe? Float down behind them? Absolute garbage. Instantly forgettable and an insult to the original's legacy."
" Severely lacking in originality.
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,3,"Over fifteen years have passed since the mysterious disappearance of Heather Donahue in the Black Hills Forest, but her brother James (James Allen McCune) still hasn't given up hope of finding her alive. When found video footage surfaces on YouTube showing what might be a fleeting glimpse of Heather, James leads a group of friends to Burkittsville, and into the woods supposedly inhabited by the Blair Witch.Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 might not have been a very good sequel, but at least it tried to do something a little different to the first film. This reboot for the Blair Witch franchise smacks of laziness and greed, the makers simply rehashing the original movie for a new generation.This film takes advantage of the advances in technology, with digital headsets and a drone used by the characters, but director Adam Wingard is, for the most part, content to regurgitate the same old, same old: strange noises outside the tents at night, stick men suspended from the trees, piles of rocks, the characters seemingly walking in circles, and a frantic finale in a creepy old house covered in children's hand-prints.About the only part of the film that doesn't feel tired and predictable is a claustrophobic crawl through a cramped tunnel by final girl Lisa (Callie Hernandez); after all of these years, we deserved more."
" Better than the original
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,6,"Controversy time: I like this more than The Blair Witch Project. It is a deeply flawed movie, and the pre-release hype let it down, but oh boy is it better than most found footage horror films. 20 years after the first one, Heather's brother goes into the same woods to find her after discovering a video tape which seems to indicate she might be alive. TBWP has aged so badly and it remains a serious struggle to get through only 90 minutes, although it's not a bad film; just a very overrated one. This is what that film should have been. In Blair Witch... something happens. It's not just people walking around the woods and swearing. There are tense, creepy scares (Although too many jump scares for sure). The unsettling atmosphere the first film created is heightened by the sense of psychological order breaking down. The actors are fine as well, although the characters are instantly forgettable. While it feels more like a remake than a sequel, it suffers from disjointed editing, too many cameras and clichéd, predictable scares, it does remain reasonably enjoyable throughout. It also leads to a scary final act. The big talking point is this: we see the witch this time. In the first one, nothing could have lived up to that build- up. However, with the hype gone and 16 years gone by, it seemed acceptable to show the witch. And it's scary. She (Or it?) does live up to the build-up after all. This isn't great and can be pretty naff at times, but it's quite an interesting late sequel on the whole. 6/10"
" Too much jump scares, lackluster script
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,4,"I can't say I remember much about the original Blair Witch Project other than I kind of liked it, I have a feeling I felt the ending was pretty creepy, but since it's probably more than 15 years since I saw it I can't say for sure. Never saw the original sequel.I wasn't even aware that there was a remake, but what drove me to watch this was the director Adam Wingard. Netflix recommended the upcoming Death Note to me, which it looked interesting. So I looked up the director and realized he had previously directed The Guest, which I actually enjoyed a lot. So I gave this new Blair Witch a look as soon as possible.It wasn't a complete trash for a movie, but in general I must say I was very disappointed when it ended. I think Adam Wingard pulled off a very stylistic 80s inspired sleeper cult classic with The Guest, which makes me wonder what the hell happened with the Blair Witch as I can't see any of that stylistic touch. Stylistically this could've been made by pretty much any ""run off the mill"" horror director. Not bad, but nothing special either. The ending is pretty tight, I have to admit that, but it's nothing special either. Unlike the ending of The Guest, which is spectacular.One thing might be that The Guest relied heavily on style, score, cinematography etc. Blair Witch takes a similar found footage style approach as the original, but IMO it doesn't serve much purpose anymore, there's nothing said about finding the footage this time or who found it etc. It's only a stylistic choice, not part of the story.I think there was some electronic ambient kind of noisy background at times in this new version, but not sure. What I am sure of is that every jump scare - which were plenty - were accompanied with a piercing sound effect. Hate that stuff. Completely random sound fx.The script is not very good either. There is no beef to the Blair Witch story really, a few tales around a camp fire, but that's it. The rest of the script is really not very meaningful. Weird things happen, but they don't make any sense, so they aren't very scary either.All in all I was disappointed. But that's mostly because I felt the director could've made a lot better reboot. There's nothing new really in this one. Why not make better use of the drone cam for example or have the guys wear GoPro's or something, but they actually used DV cams and DSLRs, which bring nothing new to table."
" don't care
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,4,"A tape is found. James stumbles upon the footage on the web. He believes that it's his sister Heather who disappeared in the original. He goes to search for her with his friends, both real life and around the web. The group is hounded by unknown forces.As the pioneer of the found footage horror genre, the world has moved on. The trope has been done to death. This production is not that bad but it adds nothing new to cinema. The characters lack definition and there are too many of them anyways. They become a meaningless blob of young people. I don't care about them and their suffering lacks interest. That means that it's a tensionless, lackluster 1st POV chase footage. The underground is good but I don't care."
" Removed everything good about the original
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,2,"For me the original was about subtle, but effective horror, relying on sounds and what you can't see. Leaving the scary parts to your imagination, the most effective way in my opinion, everything that made the original film so popular. But this film showed too much, showing the Blair Witch (but according to IMDb was actually a BW victim), tents flying through the air and the house, looked purposely distressed, made up, instead of the house out of the original.The character of Lane, was just bad!! The character was poor, the actor not good. He could have been excluded with no effect to the film.I normally like Adam Wingard films especially You're Next, but think he dropped the ball with this film.Very disappointed."
" The scares were there but the climax doesn't add up
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,4,"I hate to keep dishing out sub-par ratings but I'm afraid they're deserved. Overall, it was an interesting, suspenseful, and dark movie-- I'll give it that. However, at the climax, the whole thing--the words of wisdom, if you will--was: if you don't look at her, she can't hurt you. Where did THAT come from?? That doesn't make sense in accordance with the first, which ended with Mike in the corner, FACING the corner, with Heather screaming at him from behind (while he remains motionless) until being whacked from behind."
" Hollywood keeps reinventing the wheel
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,5,"Good effort, wasted, but good at the end. There's movies that should not be made again, this is not exactly a remake but almost becomes one, it's a shame because it has a lot of good things that highlights the final result (most of it in the second half) but this movie is condemned since it's conception, The Blair Witch Project (1999) had it all, even the naivety of the spectators, this ones doesn't, if it wasn't called ""Blair Witch"" and if they weren't looking for Heather it would have been a better movie with better reviews, not so great because the found footage argument is overused and already pretty boring and predictable, but at least it wouldn't be such an obvious money squeeze from a franchise."
" Basically, just go and watch Grave Encounters
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,5,"This film is basically grave encounters. If you've seen either film you know what I mean (PERMANENT NIGHT TIME) It's not a bad film, as there's some suspense, but it by no means good or innovative. Seriously, watch ANY OTHER SHAKY CAM MOVIE and you'll save yourself the time AND get an actual storyline that isn't just a forced attempt at following on from a 17 year old movie at the time of writing (See: The Blair Witch Project 1999).Enjoy, movie lovers!"

" How do you mess up camera work for a found footage film?!
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,2,"The only good thing I can say about this movie, compared to other bad movies, is that I at least remember the characters' names. But that's just because 70% of this film is all of the characters screaming to each other. It begins with my least favourite horror movie opening: dumb teenagers filming mundane events. Basically just exposition dumping. From there, it devolves from irritating to boring really quickly. Although to be fair, it did make me laugh a couple of times from sheer stupidity. The plot sounded good on paper and I really liked the look of the trailer but nothing worked in this movie. And I usually like horror movies, even the bad ones. My biggest annoyance (and the reason I created an account to write this review) was that they screwed up the easiest sub- genre of horror: the found footage. There are a lot of drawbacks to found footage, like shaky cam and barely seeing the action and the inevitable question ""Why the hell haven't they put the camera down?"". But whatever, when done right it can draw you in. But in a lot of scenes at the end, the male character will be filming the female, and we see she doesn't have a camera/go-pro. Mid word, the footage will switch from her face to his, and he is now empty handed. Found footage is made to look like the people in the movie are also filming it, and they couldn't even get that right. The reason this film gets two stars instead of one is the scene where Lisa first sees the white monster, screams, runs two steps and looks back. I've put more effort into running for the bus. That scene made me laugh for a good five minutes."
" Well the 3rd is better then the 1st one.
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,3,It is not hard to be better then The Blair witch project. This was not is a good movie. No it was awful. Trying to top Blair witch 2 the book of shadows that is not easy to do. This one is not ever close to being has good has Blair witch 2 book of shadows. That one is very scary. It is the only Blair witch movie that is scary. In this one. We get to see the witch for few seconds. I would not give this a 5. The story line is awful. The acting is awful. The ending is awful. I give this 3. Do not see this movie it is awful. Just see The Blair witch 2 Book of shadows. Do not waste time with this movie. And do not waste money with this movie. It is one of the worst movies from this decade.
" Could be a lot better.
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,6,"I'm a fan of the original Blair Witch movie, which gave me nightmares when I first watched it at the age of 11 or something. Never watched the Book of Shadows, 'cause I knew it would ruin the original. Still not planning to watch. Though when I heard this one was coming out, I thought that with the current technology, a better budget and hopefully more creativity, Blair Witch would kick ass. And it did, its own. This movie is like a remake of the original rather than a sequel. Nothing new, no originality. And I wish they did something better both with the story and the witch herself. Not a bad movie, if you are fine with name-yellings every 5 minutes, but sooooo not the perfect sequel it had the potential to be."
" Yet another Hollywood mistake
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,1,"The difference between this and the original is the trend of POV camera movies should have stopped awhile back, so when it was first made, it was super cool, fast forward to 2016, POV movies should not be made anymore. Jumpy footage, people running about like lost sheep in the dark, and oh yeah, 'the dark'...I could hardly see anything and was left wondering what just happened in the scene. I don't even know what happened in the end and I can't be bothered. I was not scared once and am I the only one who thought that they all deserved what was coming. It's like walking into a fire knowing that the last people didn't quite make it but you go in anyway...quite predictable and should be forgotten. The original will always remain a classic and as we all know, you can't remake or reboot or wot not a classic movie."
" Its Blair witch...
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,6,"Oh what to say. I never thought a sequel would be mind, BW was the kind of film where no sequel should exist. Was it worth it?....Yes and no. Starts off very shaky but does give some background about why he wants to search for his sister and the events that followed. The films main problem is the acting and the almost unnerving stupidity of some of the characters. I mean who would search for firewood then? Climb a tree? Drone(why and what for?). That will make more sense when you watch it.I finished the film much like I did the 1st one (pretend BoS never got made). Confused, sure I have the story but then I am not so sure? Was that the BW? What happened to Lane in those days? Will they ever find this tape? Some things are not explained well and some things I suspect figured more greatly in a longer cut of the film, the drone being one such.Overall, I liked it. solid 6/10. If you did not like the 1st one thought, you probably won't like this."
" The ending saved it
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,6,This was heading for a 4/10 after the first three quarters of the film was just a poor rehash of the original. The originality of the ending and exceptionally uncomfortable viewing when Lisa is in the tunnels gave the title some genuine chills and a redeeming feature. If you've seen BWP just just skip to the final 20mins of this film safe in the knowledge you're missing little before it on BW.
" If you liked the Blair Witch Project, you'll like this
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,7,"I'm a big horror fan and I was also a big fan of the original movie. I wasn't expecting much from this one - given it had a 5.0 rating on IMDb. Usually a horror movie needs to be rated 7.0+ to be any good.This was pretty good though. The acting was top notch - especially the black guy - he's a talent. Sound design, set design and production also very good. One of the things I like about horror is that because it's so cheap overall, they usually don't go cheap on production.I won't spoil the story but will just say it is 'innovative'. I'm SUPER jaded when it comes to horror, but I enjoyed this."
" Going forward ... into the past
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,5,"I have to admit, I also thought this was a Remake or ""Re-imagening"" as they call it nowadays. Was wrong as many others I reckon. And there is more than meet the eye (if you can make out what meets the eye ... because of the ""shaky cam"" and the framing, that kind of leaves a lot blurred or at least does not clarify as much as some would like it would). A lot more especially if you are aware of the original ""mythology"" and all those crazy theories and whatnot.So I guess depending on your level of devotion you may see more here than others. But overall this is a sub-par experiment/rescue mission. It's OK but nothing too special. I like the director and the direction they took this too, but I'm still not a Blair Witch believer"
" Pointless
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,2,"Remember the first Blair witch movie? Yeah, then you don't need to see this. It's an updated version, but without the hype and sound design (oh, there are creepy sounds in this one too, so many in fact that they stop being creepy after a short while) that made the first one successful although not good, and slightly frightening. But sure, if you like to hear people scream names of people you don't really care about, and enjoy the tiresome jump-scares, and shaky cameras, and annoying frightened breathing noises, then you might enjoy this movie. I did not."
" Fear Not, All Who Enter Here
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,1,"If, like me, your paying to rent this movie in the hopes it's some kind of remake, a dust off from the original movie, made into its full possibilities of scream inducing terrors and things that go bump in the night, then your going to be very, very, very disappointed. If however you want a horror that shows people talking without their lips moving, stupid thrashing around in the woods scenes which will make you want to B/Slap one of them, and bad bad bad acting along with bad scripting & the feel of the 'self recorded film' feels super fake, kinda like when you watch a really bad movie and ... oh wait, you ARE watching a really bad movie, never mind. There's not even any gratuitous sex scenes or nudity to spice it up a little. So all I can suggest if you want to watch a good remake of an older movie, go hire out the Evil Dead remake, now they did that film justice ! If you want to hire a bad movie to laugh at, forget this one, it's not funny bad, it's just sad, lifeless and best left to gather dust on some server somewhere, let's just hope aliens never see this and think this is what us humans are really like, or we're all doomed to wander aimlessly in dark woods forever."
" The Very Sad Reality of Remakes
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,4,"Though this one wasn't the box office hit its original was, it still made back 25x its budget, when we have beautiful, terrifying films that sometimes just break even. Backpacking on a story that wasn't even theirs, with characters i'm not even sure we're meant to care about, and decision making that will have you rolling your eyes into the back of your soul, The Blair Witch falls flat on its back, and doesn't get back up.The movie has its moments, sure, where we are truly wondering what is going on in those mystical woods. It took the idea of the neverending night from many movies in the past but I wasn't even sure if I liked that, as it didn't happen in the first movie at all, but it is a definite visceral scare to think about an everlasting night so at least they tried.I didn't like the whole medusa idea like if you look at it you die... Hmm then what were those guys doing on coffin rock with their entrails gashed out of them all tied together?THE DECISIONS THESE GUYS MAKE LOL STOP IT. ""I think my seesters in there!"" 17 years later in an old broken down house after watching a video where she clearly died... Worst part about this movie was the most scares you got were always jump scares from the people scaring each other because apparently they walk silently and don't know how to tell their friends they're there. Please stop with the blair witch remakes unless you can really nail it without the gimmicks, I want this hour and a half of my life back."
" Everything That is Wrong With Modern 'Horror'
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,1,"This film is everything that is wrong with modern horror. Bratty characters that you actually will to die, rubbish backstories that you couldn't care less about, long boring bits of inane dialogue, pathetic attempts at jump/gross out scares (which neither make you jump or grossed-out), boring special effects and a total cop-out of an ending. Not scary in the slightest. Not entertaining in the slightest. Banal, no point to it. How on earth can someone class this kind of stuff as a 'horror'?? They get away with putting that label on total drivel now.I hate found-footage, so why did I watch it? I remembered enjoying Blair Witch all those years ago (when it was groundbreaking)and enjoying the eeriness of it all. This film is about as eerie as watching lawn bowls. It also has the flimsiest of connections to the first film. Have I learned anything from the film? yes, don't watch latter day sequels/remakes of great movies."
" Terrifyingly Great
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,7,"This movie has so many bad reviews I almost didn't watch it. This movie is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, even though the acting can be rough at times. The movie's fear factor was numbing, so if you like a good scare, watch this. I wouldn't recommend this to somebody who gets scared easily because it is definitely nightmare material. Overall, this movie, in my opinion, was much better and scarier than the first."
" Exactly what you think it's going to be like
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,4,"Nothing more, nothing less...It's another attempt at the first Blair Witch, the name of the Movie already has people watching it, the fact its the same, but not quite the same, movie will make people hate it. something like the Blair Witch Project isn't like a star wars movie you can remake and throw in everything people like about the first but on a bigger budget and everyone will love it. I don't think you can do another one and for the same audience who loved the first to love the next, i think the originality of the first is what made people love it in the first place, so you just have to make a NEW movie, imagine that, with a new idea, new story.. I've horror and found footage movies, as as far as they go this actually isn't bad. but i think people have really got to start coming up with new ideas rather than reselling the same thing"
" Truly terrified
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"the first Blair witch film still scares me to death. It is a classic as far as horror movies go. The sequel was fun but regretfully a bad film. So the third....I watched through my hands, jumped 50 million times and was scared to go to bed. Yes, I am a wuss but this film did its job perfectly in my opinion. The visuals and audio are so tense and creepy. The characters are performed well and the script is great.A must see for horror fans."
" A slick Blair Witch for the new generation
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,6,"BLAIR WITCH is an attempt to update THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT for a new generation. Some may look at it and see yet another found footage film that does nothing new, but I found it a movie that ties into the first film quite nicely. Director Adam Wingard has showed promise on his previous films YOU'RE NEXT and THE GUEST and in his hands this is a slick and watchable movie.If course, it's not as good as the original BLAIR WITCH, although it's obviously better than that BOOK OF SHADOWS sequel. But as a found footage film it's fast-paced and engaging, with some good actors filling out the roles and plenty of creepy sound effects and weird events taking place in the background. The film generally gets by on jump scares and atmospherics although the second half builds up with gruesome realism and an intense climax that plays out just as you'd expect. It's no masterpiece, not like the original is, but it's nonetheless a fun watch."
" Dear God why...
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,1,"It never ceases to amaze me how easily the majority of people are entertained. I know, I know, opinions are like a**holes, everyone has one. It just kills me that so many are that of the ""I'm an imbecile and this is one of the greatest films ever"" variety that litter the reviews here.Aside from the migraine inducing camera-work and horrendous audio making one wish that they were deaf, what really grinds my gears about this latest installment of the Blair Witch is the movie trend of insulting the viewer's intelligence and completely disregarding any lack of common sense. To be fair, many other horror films integrate this ideal as well, giving us characters who were plucked from fantasy-land who have never had to deal with any traumatic or life-threatening situation and lack any cognitive functioning on how to preserve one's own well-being.Yes, these are fictional stories, but part of storytelling and getting viewers to like characters is to make those characters relatable to the audience. This is where Blair Witch fails the most, which speaks volumes given all of its shortcomings. The movie explains that Josh was 4 years old when his sister Heather from the original Blair Witch disappeared. They don't give a specific age for Josh but presumably at least 17 years have passed as he is of legal drinking age in the movie. I don't care how deep-seeded your love for a family member can be, there is no way anyone would be foolish enough to believe someone who vanished in the woods 17 years prior would be found there still. Not alive at least, and yet even to the bitter end Josh clings to the ""I'm gonna find Heather!"" mantra that costs the lives of himself and his companions. Seriously, no one is that stupid and if they are they shouldn't have made it 20-something years through life without meeting an ""unfortunate"" accident.This movie wouldn't have garnered a single star from me had it not been for the interesting twist in the end that the found footage Josh viewed in the beginning of the film that led to him wanting to go out and look for Heather was actually the footage of Lisa looking for him in the house that would serve as their tomb. Even with that, this film was a complete waste of an hour and a half of my life that I will never get back, and I feel dumber for having sat through the entire thing."
" Sigh...
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,3,"You know, there are some movies, even some type of movies in its entirety, you can only see once in your lifetime. They simply can't be replicated, like the loss of your first tooth. The original Blair witch was one of those events, not even stating it was good or bad. It had me wondering, leaving the theater, if the footage was - actually - real, and I wasn't the only moviegoer in doubt. Let's just say the movie took my virginity. So a remake is doomed to fail for me, I realize that, even if I want that 'feel' back - but not for other moviegoers that will see 'found footage' for the first time, and are in doubt and genuine suspense because of the authenticity. But even there it fails, because of the use of the title. In fact, I would have scored this movie higher if it was an irrelevant project.The video quality is too crisp, the actors are professionals, the editing is done in a studio, and it all works against itself. The jump scares are unrealistic and out of place. The turning point of my tolerance was the added sound effects upon removing a bandage off of a foot.It is still way better than Blair witch 2, but I turned the movie off halfway. 3/10 is my fair rating, all things considered."
" (Unfotunately for me) Iv'e seen worse
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,2,I'm a cinema lover and watch really lots of movies of all kinds. The only reason I give a 2 is that I've seen worse than this but honestly this is almost crap. There's nothing scary on this movie ! Because of the way it was filmed (and some movies got it right some years ago) but it looks like you need to concentrate a lot to understand what you are watching. For me it just gave that that sad sensation of waste of time. Very poor script. The story is very weak too and it doesn't keep you entertained (At 1 hour of movie I was already thinking on stopping watching it.) Only screams and yelling in the woods. Total disappointment.
" Unfortunately more a horror film like any other, without innovating and nothing, Bad.
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,2,"Blair Witch (Blair Witch) is a continuation of the Blair Witch of 1999 that revolutionized the genre of terror, even though it is a medium movie, but this style of the actors themselves was the Blair Witch that popularized the style, Blair Witch (2016) is inferior to His 1999 movie, the film does not fear, and the suspense scenes do not work so well, I was tense only in the last minutes, but I found that they took something always worked well in the first Blair Witch, the cast is medium, the Actors act more or less, and this makes you feel nothing by the legs, the direction of Adam Wingard is medium also, it seems that neither director in the film, and well the film is well cliché, weak dialogues, a weak script, One of the worst movies of the last 10 years.

" Hollywood Recycled Product: Trash
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,4,"Why bother. Why even bother? Why even bother to make a sequel that will only serve as a rehash of its predecessor. ""Blair Witch"" could had been better if it went on a different direction from the first movie. The most we could discern on the differences between the two is the addition for more characters in the latest instalment unlike the original which has only three, and unfortunately, the rest is chaff. Director Adam Wingard's filmography includes a superb thriller ""You're Next"". I'm surprised he did make this.In the first movie, three film students, who reportedly went missing, travelled to a forest to make a documentary programme about a mythical figure called 'Blair Witch'. Now, in the sequel (decades later), finds the brother (James Allen McCune) of Heather (one of the three film students) believing that her sister is still alive after seeing a video on the internet containing an image of her 'sister'. The story at the start is already feeble; the brother's selected choice for proof of his sister's survival is merely a video he sees on the internet posted by people who lack credence.Unlike the original movie which is convincing hugely due to its originality, and superb writing and performances, ""Blair Witch"" lacks the impact its predecessor has. This movie which is scant of new ideas, is just another exercise for futility of horror flicks.If only recycling ideas from past movies is illegal, then I would bet that cinema will have a brighter future. Emphatically I stick with it being a wholly unoriginal work of Adam Wingard, despite performing quite well at the box-office. Critics and too general reviewers had voiced out about their contempt for this movie. Although it has some good scares and atmosphere, these regurgitated achievements will be useless as deemed perpetrated by what I have had mentioned throughout here.Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com"
" I knew it...
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,4,"Admittedly, I knew this wasn't going to be anything special. Especially not when it's attempting to live up to the 1999 edition, which was of course a simplistic masterpiece from a time long before the found footage style was overused and still relatively unique.It's not really scary, perhaps a little jumpy at best. The legend of the Blair Witch, a story and a concept which proved so powerful in the original is overshadowed in the remake by this desire to try and make the film seem as horrifying and as gruesome as possible. Also, part of what made the original so freaky was that we never see the Blair Witch, this leaves much to the imagination, whereas this remake reveals her as just another unspectacular CGI mess that's so common in modern horror films.I know, I'm comparing so much to the original but why not? For being so original and so simplistic, the 1999 edition captures everything I think a horror film should have, some disagree but those tend to be people who don't take the time to sit quiet and watch it properly. In short,there is nothing outstanding about this film, and anything new is dull and overdone, not to mention it fails miserably in its attempt to link the two films stories' together. If you like jumpy films then perhaps you'll like it, but if you're looking for a good story, look elsewhere..."
" Horrible
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,1,"A very unpleasant viewing experience from start to finish (not in a ''horror'' sense, just unpleasant). Ridiculously dumb characters, pointless gross-out, completely unnecessary ''witch'' monster (the original was great because it didn't rely on trite monster clichés and actually had some decent pacing)... The only thing that's scary about this movie is how much I cringed watching this. Would not suggest, even if you're a fan of schlocky horror movies like myself."
" Leave Well Enough Alone!
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,5,"This installment of ""The Blair Witch Project"" franchise is actually kind of a let down. All it really did was rip off from the original. To me, when the original ""Blair Witch Project"" film came out, it was kind of ground breaking and new because it set the stage for films of its kind. The original ""Blair Witch Project"" was absolutely scary. I couldn't even look at a forest, let alone take a walk in one without thinking about ""The Blair Witch Project"". Even one of my friends said that he had to sleep with the lights on after watching ""The Blair Witch Project"". This film, on the other hand, is nothing like that. I mean it wasn't scary at all and the parts that were meant to make the viewer jump or scream didn't. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is like ""Paranormal Activity"", leave well enough alone. The original doesn't need sequels, unless the directors and writers know what they are doing. With that being said, there was one good little twist in the beginning and end of this film when James (James Allen McCune) was watching the found footage from his sister, other than that this film is a let down. If you're expecting it to be like the original don't hold your breath."
" A return to the Black Hill Forrest and a Blair Witch search.
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,5,"Adam Wingard directs this spooky tale of college student James (James Allen McCune) convincing some of his friends to venture into the Black Hill Forest in Maryland to search for some clues to the disappearance of his sister, who, at one time herself, was looking for information concerning the legend of the Blair Witch. Things seem promising when a pair of locals offer to act as guides through the woods, but as night falls the group is lost and paranoia sets in hard. Slowly, sinister sounds and happenings give the group the idea there is a menacing presence that does not want them there.Some creepiness and fright similar to the original THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999). Some disturbing images and situations. Kudos go to cinematography of Robby Baumgartner, as well as the music of director Wingard.Rounding out the cast: Corbin Reid, Wes Robinson, Valone Curry, Callie Hernandez and Brandon Scott."
" Why such negativity?
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,7,"Why did this film get such bad reviews? I thought it was decent overall. It did have a lot of legitimate scares, albeit some of them a bit too gruesome and jump-scary for my tastes. However, as someone who played the PC Blair Witch games, I thought it was quite accurate and had a lot of tie- in moments (most notably Blair Witch, Volume I: Rustin Parr). I feel like the creators of this film might have maybe actually seen or played these games, and used them as inspiration. That's rare! The scares were a bit predictable-- I especially hated one character climbing a tree. But overall, I thought it was a tasty little addition to the Blair Witch mythos, and surely vastly superior to the vomit- inducing original sequel. I think Blair Witch is definitely worth a rental, but needs a bit of a warning to those with motion sickness. Still, isn't that a part of the Blair Witch charm? As someone who grew up in the 90s and loved the original film, I give a definite recommendation."
" Blair Witch is Plagued by the Same Problems as the Original but it Delivers a Decent Payoff at Least
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"This movie has a lot to live up to. The first Blair Witch movie divided audiences around the world but it raked in the big bucks. No one cared about the sequel (I haven't seen it but I've heard its crap) so the franchise died off and for a lot of people it faded from memory. I was in the camp that liked the original, I hadn't seen a found-footage movie before and it was pretty revolutionary. Watching it today, it's hard to understand why it was so popular. I went into this movie open minded though, it didn't get good reviews but there are lots of decent movies that get bad reviews. I came out liking this movie better than I didn't, it has problems for sure but it also gives you what you want by the end.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The footage for this movie was found on May 25, 2014. Our main character is James Donaghue (James Allen McCune) who believes he's found some evidence of his missing sister Heather online. The video shows someone running through an abandoned house being followed by something. There's a brief shot where you can see something in a mirror that looks like a woman. The footage was found in a forest in Maryland where Heather and her friends went missing looking for the Blair Witch. Lisa (Callie Hernandez) is filming a documentary about James' search for Heather. James and Lisa meet up with Peter (Brandon Scott) and Ashley Bennett (Corbin Reid) and they head out to meet the people that posted the footage online. The endgame is to go back to the forest to look for any evidence that Heather could still be alive.My review for this movie will be relatively short and sweet. When it comes to what I didn't like is that this movie couldn't get over the same hurdle that the original Blair Witch tripped over. Almost nothing happens for the first 30-45 minutes of this movie and it was pretty boring. It's pretty much these people meeting up and hanging out in the woods. They throw in a couple of annoying jump scares but that's the horror equivalent of low hanging hanging fruit. Just because something goes bang all of a sudden doesn't make it scary.The things they got right are that they created some decent characters and they gave you an ending that made the rest of the movie worth watching. I actually liked most of the characters in this movie, you get the motivation to go back into the woods and the conflict between them feels at least semi-plausible. It's rare for a horror movie to get that right. The other thing is that in the end, you actually get some cool scenes of people going up against the Blair Witch and her powers. The one scene that deals with claustrophobia was pretty effective and it left me squirming. I also need to mention that they obviously put some money into this movie. It's better filmed and the sound editing was much improved over the original.I can see why this movie is divisive but calling it absolute garbage isn't giving it enough credit. It's not a great horror movie and compared to other movies this year (Don't Breathe, Lights Out, Green Room) it doesn't stack up. It has the same problems but there was some improvement. Better characters, better production values and a better ending means this movie gets a better grade. It won't break ground but I think it will satisfy both fans of the series and newcomers alike."
" This film is bad and should not have been made.
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,3,"This movie is a prime example of everything wrong with the found- footage sub-genre. The characters are flat,scares are weak, everything is spoon fed and it ruins the mystery of the original film.Lets start of with actual ""horror"" element in this film. I'm not joking, nine times out of ten a character will come on screen via a fake jump scare. and that's all I have to say about the horror because all there is. There is none of the psychological thrill of the original. This film is bad and should not have been made.Then we have the charterers. Its just the usual blank slate protagonists. I'd be surprised if anyone could name more things about James then ""He wants to save his sister who loves he loves very much."" The dialog is boring and no one seems to have any chemistry. This film is bad and should not have been made.This film has ruined the original blare witch for me (I won't get into that to avoid spoilers).in conclusion, this feels like a cheap knock-off of the blare witch project. Don't give your money to films like this, it will only encourage more studios to resurrect more beloved classics to make shitty re-boots/remakes/sequels. This film is bad and should not have been made."
" You're missing the point of this movie!!!
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,8,"Too many reviews are focusing on the fact that this sequel does everything like the original. Yes, it is like watching the original with today's advance technology....but that's the point!!! Those stick figures in the trees are iconic and blood curling. Blair Witch is NOT some chainsaw or machete killer who thinks up different ways to torture her victims. This is witchcraft. She can make her victims lose those minds by doing what she has always done. ""A group of people getting lost in these woods"" That's the concept! Blair Witch can manipulate the physical appearance of these woods so her victims keep walking in circle with no way out. She can manipulate independent time where a person can think 5 days have gone by without the sun coming up, whereas a different character can only believe an afternoon has gone past. ""Same ending with people standing in the corner"" they are giving a more approached view on the belief 'If you don't look, she can't hurt you' Again, she can use her witchcraft to make you hear voices that aren't really there in order to trick you to turn around and look. This sequel did not ruin the point or originality of the first movie. It lets you keep your own fearful image by not exposing what the witch looks like. Blair witch, just like the original, keeps it scary by only imaging what they are seeing. There are quick glimpses of sinister looking figures behind the trees, but this is not her. Could be her previous victims under her spell? As explained in the first and this sequel ""You have to do what she says"" This is in order to be released from her spell and leave the woods. They do it all the same in this movie, but with more concept and explanation"
" Pretty darn good sequel!
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,8,"As a fan of the original, I was really unsure of how this movie would turn out. I was confused that this was categorized as a sequel and a reboot, but it plays mostly as a sequel. I don't usually like movies with unknowns, especially 20-something unknowns. (They're usually not good.) This cast didn't bother me, though. They were good, without overacting. I found myself really enjoying this movie. On the DVD, you see that there was lots of work to match the original's sets, and I read that there was a lot of thought put into creating this movie. It's scary, and interesting. If you're worried that it's a typical revamping of an old franchise, worry not! If you enjoyed the original, there's a great chance you'll like this one, too! 8/10 (P.S.- There's no need to watch ""Book of Shadows"" if you didn't see that one. Just move on to this one!)"
" Total trash. Almost unwatchable.
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,2,"The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. Though the odds are slim, it has a chance. I would wager, then, that in half the time it would take to reproduce a great play, a monkey could easily draft a screenplay with more skill and subtlety than ""Blair Witch,"" easily one of the worst films I have seen in a while. I don't know if that's a compliment to the simple odds of chance or an insult to the skill and brainpower of the filmmakers behind this slosh.In 1999, ""The Blair Witch Project"" began what has been dubbed 'the shaky-cam' style of filmmaking. It's borderline documentary, and the film did it with such skill and art that many people believed the three actors to be truly missing persons. Even today, rewatching this film is a powerful testament to structure, psychological horror, and growing suspense. I wouldn't say that I still find the film scary, but it does what great horror always has done: it burrows deep into our psyche. I'd even go so far to say that the final 5 minutes of the original film are some of the most genuinely-horrifying and eerie moments I have ever seen in a movie.It's almost 17 years later, and we find Hollywood churning out work like this; a movie so riddled with inconsistencies and jump scares that it's a wonder it was ever at all greenlit. The plot is so thin that it's barely there: a young boy tried to find his sister (Heather, the girl from the original film) who he believes is still alive in the woods based on footage he found online. Why he would assume a girl missing for over 20 years (don't forget, the original was footage found from 1994) would still be alive is one thing, but he convinces 3 of his friends to journey with him to find out the truth. At this point in the movie, he should have become concerned at seeing his friends are all attractive teenagers who fit the standard slasher lineup: a couple who is more interested in sex than anything else, a single and beautiful brunette, and a single teenage boy. Perfect.In the woods, they quickly begin a camp out and are joined by a local couple who originally discovered the online footage. In the night, many of the iconic 'stick-figure' voodoo dolls are mysteriously hung up. I wonder who's to blame? So forth and so on, the characters find themselves stuck in a loop as in the original: unable to find their way out of the woods. The local couple admits to stringing up the figures to conjure up fear, and yet the next night when they return, the group is again terrified of the mysteries of the woods.Where the original found horror in the unseen (I think the most horrifying moment is hearing a baby laughing in the distance while the campers sleep in the safety of their tent), this movie throws it all at the screen, with mutilated bodies and scary naked monsters roaming free at any given moment. There is no suspense, no build up, and justly no pay off. What the original mastered, this isn't even a pale comparison. It is garbage.I give the film 1/2 a star as opposed to zero based solely on the performance of Callie Hernandez (the single, attractive brunette) who in the final minutes of the film gives one of the most authentic performances of panic I think I have ever seen. The quiver in her voice, the inconsistency with her breathing. For only a moment, I found myself actually understanding the horror meant to be felt by the characters on screen. Too bad for me that I only began caring in the last 30 or 40 seconds of the entire film. What a mess."
" The Jump Scare Project
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,4,"Adam Wingard is considered by many in the horror community to be one of the best young directors coming up right now. Frankly, I've never much been impressed with his work before this and after seeing this travesty I'm even less impressed. I simply cannot fathom what some of the horror blogs and websites appreciated about this movie when they gave it such rave reviews. I know, as I push past 40 years old, that I am not exactly the target demographic for teenage horror any longer. Being the age that I am, though, makes me also right in the wheelhouse of the generation who adored the original. I was in my late teens when THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT came out. I saw it on a date, as a matter of fact, and was blown away. Having grown up in the era of the slasher film, I was more used to horror being much more blatant and gory. It had become a mockery of itself by the 90s, though, and we were all so hungry for something fresh to re-kindle horror and this movie took the world by storm. If you are too young to remember, it's release then you really can't understand the impact that it had. Nowadays, indie horror is packed full of found footage, but this was revolutionary to us. Even more, the style of horror was something that my younger, novice horror mind was not yet used to. This was horror that was that was not in your face with a villain or brutal deaths. This was much more psychological, an intense fear-driven journey through into truly frightening territory.I was excited when it was announced that a sequel/remake was coming. I thought this could legitimately have a chance to be good, but man was I wrong. This movie seems to completely misunderstand everything that made the original terrifying and replace it with dumbed down horror for brainless fans. Then again, when I see the younger reviewers on this site tear apart the original BLAIR WITCH as boring and ""unscary"", then maybe I get a better understanding of the adderall-fueled legions that this movie was trying to target.Whether you liked the original film, or not, it definitely starts out with a much more interesting cast. The trio in the original have their annoying habits, but they are likable people with personalities. The characters in this one are as cardboard as it comes. The tragic hero looking for lost loved one. The jock. The weird stoners. All we're missing is the slut. Now, take these boring people and stick them out in the woods with no building sense of dread, at all. Replace that with instant terror that takes almost no time to build right, then endless shots of the characters walking around screaming each others names. Now, replace all of the subtlety of the original for loud noises and witches who have now become X-men villains, capable of ripping tents up out of the ground and knocking over trees. All of it leads to a house in the middle of nowhere, with a camera-shaking chase through random scenes of horror, more loud noises and crashes and tantalizing glimpses of a bad monster that we're probably better off having not seen in its' entirety but since viewers seem to be too unimaginative now to see a movie and have to imagine the monster rather than see it, we have to be given something.I'm sounding a lot grumpier than I intended to, but this movie makes me mad. It's an all too perfect example of the sort of garbage horror that gets brought to the big screen while terrific movies go almost unnoticed on some streaming site that a few hundred people get to see. It's a reminder that Hollywood is completely afraid to back original horror and this mockery of the original doesn't deserve the Blair Witch name."
" Fun but completely lacks the authentic feeling of the original
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,5,"The first Blair Witch is a film that I have a lot of respect for and has had a huge influence on the genre. What made it so amazing, is the fact that the actors really were scared. The directors took a creative approach to making the movie that shouldn't have worked, but it did.Normally, when you watch a movie, you suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride. This usually involves overlooking the fact that it's pretty obvious you are watching actors acting, no mater how talented they are. The original Blair Witch is the only movie I know of where it's obvious that nothing is forced and nothing is fake. It's flaws and shortcomings are part of what makes it so real and so great.This movie is nothing like that. It's a carefully crafted Hollywood remake, and like most low budget horror films, the acting is not that great. They took the approach that every other movie in Hollywood takes, because it's the only way to guarantee results. It makes for a movie that works, but in a completely different way than the original. The original was a cultural phenomenon, that got everyone talking, because it felt SO REAL that people actually believed it WAS REAL! It was a historical event and gave rise to countless imitators and parodies. This remake will not go down in history and there is nothing terribly special about it, but if you accept that and are a horror fan, there is still plenty to like.So don't go into expecting to see anything brilliant or revolutionary, but if you get past the bad acting and cheesy melodrama, it will give you a few good scares."
" Dumb, clichéd bore-fest
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,2,"They do a sequel to Blair Witch years after the ""found footage"" thing has worn out every cliché and all they do is the same stuff every other movie has done, but worse. A good portion of this is just a bunch of idiots talking - oddly is supposed to be found footage and there are lots of ""camera going black"" or freezing up through the thing yet when the dumb ""conversations"" are going on between multiple people we get tons of angles just like a regular movie.There are a lot of shots that were not done by a camera supposedly someone was holding - I assume they're hoping no one would notice.There is tons of people walking through the woods calling out someone's name. Tons of this. There are lots of ""someone quietly looking for someone who then runs into them and a quick 'jolt' sound is heard."" Cheap fake scares that are done because of lack of writing and ability to do the real thing. In fact there's a lot of ""added noises"" like when someone runs into someone, the quick ""violin jolt"" noise and things like that.The characters are all idiots and unlikable. They had the opportunity to do something good here and misfired big time. None of these people involved in this stupidity should be allowed to be in the industry ever again."
" A decent sequel
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,9,"Seriously nowhere near as bad as some reviews make out! I sometimes wonder exactly what people expect from films these days, the acting was good, it was atmospheric and had good scares. Is it a masterpiece of film? No, however it was very entertaining. Just don't expect much and enjoy it. The footage of running through the woods was done well and the lapse of time was very creepy. I did enjoy the first one (didn't we all?) and this really wasn't disappointing. The house at the end was very well done and suitably confusing, this was probably my favourite bit. Overall I think this was a well thought out and decent sequel with good acting, good concept and still one of the best found footage type films. As much as films like this are always going to divide opinion, give it a try."
" It does not disappoint
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,8,"A great film, mostly cause I enjoyed a lot the original and this one is totally respectful from that film even after 16 years. I liked the Blair Witch Project because it is the first film which shows a found footage film (including low budget and without computer effects). The plot and the characters are well adapted and the dialogues remember me to the original dialogues, it seems that the director tried to keep the same atmosphere into the woods and reviving similar situations. The final was fine, all I have to criticize is that I felt disappointed about the way that the witch is created and is pictured (that's why I scored it a 8 out of 10)."
" 'Blair Witch' is scary-as-hell.
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Seventeen years later, we have journeyed back into the Black Woods in Burkittsville, Maryland to seek out the Blair Witch. Back in 1999, one of the first examples of viral marketing came splashing on the scene with 'The Blair Witch Project', where we saw trailers of faux police interviews and news reports that three college kids went missing in the woods and the footage that was found was real. Filmed all with a hand-held camera in first person back in 1999, this film was one of the first movies to deal with the ""found footage"" aspect and it worked to great effect as everyone thought the film and people in it were real. It was highly effective and scary-as-hell and became a cult-phenomenon and paved the way for tons of ""found footage"" movies.The movie was made for only $60,000 and ended up bringing in almost $250 million. There was a sequel called 'Book of Shadows', but it was nothing like the original and was poorly received by the masses, even though I enjoyed the film. Cut to present day where director Adam Wingard ('The Guest') and writer Simon Barrett ('The Guest') fooled everyone into thinking they were making a movie called 'The Woods', but at San Diego Comic Con, it was unveiled that its real title was 'Blair Witch', which is a sequel to the original film, set twenty years later. Like the original film, this follows a group of college kids, four this time who cross paths with two locals who want to tag along.The leader of this group is James Donahue, who is the brother of Heather Donahue from the first film who went missing. James along with his friends set out to find out what really happened, where like the original film, things start to happen in the woods. Wingard and Barrett have added some excellent mystique and twists this time around regarding the folklore and the witch herself, but they never give too many details, which makes the film still fresh and begs you to dive into that rabbit hole of its myth. Since we are twenty years later, there are some technological advances to use the film equipment, such as a drone and blue tooth ear cameras, which were cool to see used in this setting.The start of the film is business as usual with the usual subtle scares, but the last twenty minutes of the film is where things turn to eleven on the Holy-Sh*t-O-Meter and never stops. There are some real genuine scares here, and not just the type to make you jump out of your seat either. These scares stay with you for a while and make you afraid to walk down the dark hallway at night. This is an excellent sequel that pays homage to the original, while keeping the stories and characters fresh some twenty years later. Despite some cheap scares in the beginning, 'Blair Witch' is back and scary-as-hell.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
" Loved it! *Mild spoiling*
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,10,"It isn't often we see horror movies without the slasher-horror and that is what makes this the perfect horror-movie. I must admit I would've loved some kind of closure with the witch, but that's the only negative in my opinion. It got a lot of jump scares! Most movies i predict when the next scare is coming, but not with this one. It was refreshing! Brilliant work, both by the director and the actresses. I hope some horror-directors will get some inspiration from Blair Witch 2016. I am beyond impressed by the acting of the girl playing Lisa, especially at the end. All in all, this is the perfect horror movie to watch a late night with your buddy!"
" A Reboot with Zero Substance
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,3,"I was initially excited about this film. I loved the original, which gave us an entire new genre to horror. Although found footage has been exhausted by every measure I was willing to give the original a free pass due to it's founding roots... except this film was a massacre, same as the second installment of the franchise, to it's original. This is why Indie filmmakers are still leading the charge on originality and Hollywood studios remain steps behind... and late to the party.Regardless, I had some nostalgia when I saw the trailer and thought maybe... just maybe.. they might have made a fitting tribute to the original. No.The film is a disaster of senseless, random screaming, incoherent dialog and a plot that bored me out of my mind. By the end, I wanted to kill them all. Including the writer and director.It could have been great. It had a marketable legacy and an embedded audience. But it was dumbed down, not scary in the least, and an insult to fans of the original. All I kept thinking throughout was ""What a waste."""
" Not for intelligent viewer
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,1,"**JUST WATCHED IT**This movie will not be enjoyed by the intelligent viewer.This is the *WORST* movie I have ever seen. The trailer is 100 times better than the actual movie. Please do not be fooled.I give this a 0/10 for being the most boring and lame movie I have ever seen.This ridiculous movie was written by Simon Barrett. Remember that name.I am so frustrated I wasted 90mins of my life :(This movie is filled with lame sound effects done by every other movie in the past, lame supernatural forces already done by every other movie in the past, and the cheapest jump scare of all when a person suddenly pops up into the camera with sound effects; not even these jump scares were even scary.The sequence of events is completely predictable and absolutely nothing makes sense.I feel bad for all those people who actually paid to see this movie. They got scammed! It bothers me tremendously that this movie actually made 9 times its budget.I should have read reviews before watching it. I won't make the same mistake again.If you do not value your time, then go ahead and waste it on this movie."
" completely underrated and misunderstood
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"I see a lot of reviews saying the same basic things about this movie. It seems people either rate it poorly because it was a hyped movie, and it's fashionable to hate on anything hyped, or they completely misunderstood the movie; so therefor it's bad. The truth is, the movie expands on lore in many different ways, but the film makers do so through hints, and subtlety, mixed in with the chaos of the situation. This movie is simultaneously a thinking persons movie, and a popcorn scare flick. That is extremely hard to accomplish, so you should expect people to feel confused. But understand, that is the point of the movie. You are supposed to feel disoriented and confused. Found Footage movies should never fully explain what is going on, because that would be extremely unrealistic and obviously forced. There are terrible found footage movies, but people, this is not one of them. The movie had to have some parts that were similar, if not nearly exact to the original, or people would complain that it's too different. But now people are complaining it's too much the same. That's a copout. It's like saying Halloween 2 is too similar to Halloween 1 because it has Michael Myers stalking people. It's a moot point. And if you don't like shaky cam, or can't handle it, why are you watching found footage to begin with. Saying it's bad because of shaky cam makes no sense. You might as well complain about a black and white film because it has no color. Blair Witch expands on the mythology, but you have to pay attention. It delivers a story that is undeniably suspenseful/scary. And it toys with the possibilities of otherworldly forces manipulating time and space. All of these things are just like the original, but amped up; which is EXACTLY what you are SUPPOSED TO DO IN A SEQUEL. Ignore the haters and watch it for yourself, but understand if you expect to hate it, you will make up any excuse to fulfill that expectation instead of giving it a fair review."
" The history repeats, and so the story in some sequel films!
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"This is the third film is the 'Blair Witch' film series, but the second film from the story perspective. Anyway, I haven't seen the other sequel, you do not have to be familiar with that to follow this one. So I saw it, but what I thought is, basically this film is exactly same as the first film. Just the characters and timeline changed, that's all.They had nothing much of choice, so the story was repeated with the modern equipments. A new set of people, including a brother of one of those went missing two decades ago, heads to the same woods to investigate. But soon they all begin to witness strange, horrifying events. Now it becomes their survival game of getting out safe from there, but would they? Is what the film's end to notify us.If you are a horror genre fan, particularly about the killing stuffs, then you might enjoy it. Other than that it was not scary, well, it was not for me. The today's generation might enjoy it better, but if you are like above 30 and already saw the original, this will be an average or trash. So young people should watch it. For me, it was okay, because I was not expecting anything from it. So I hope they end it here, no to another sequel or the reboot.6/10"
" Another predictable horror full of jump scares.
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,5,"It took something that was unique (for it's time), individual and simplistically effective and turned it into your regular run-of-the-mill modern horrors. Full of predictability and cheap jump scares (a LOT of cheap jump scares). It was also so predictable, in fact, that you can almost count down the seconds to every scary moment.I would've gladly rated this movie a 2 or 3 out of 10, if not for the final quarter of the movie. It was genuinely scary. A few elements that we haven't seen much of before, or haven't seen done effectively. For that, I'll bump it up to a 5. I understand that it was aiming for a vast audience. Directors know that jump scares are unappreciated by people that actually take the genre seriously, but they also know that it hauls in the crowds that are just after easy thrills. They prioritise revenue over creativity, and that's something I strongly feel cheapens movies. Especially when it's done so shamelessly, like this."
" mh,you see.yaa
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,5,"Blair Witch is the long waited sequel to one of my fav horrors The Blair Witch Project which I have on my page. The film dose not connect at all to Book Of Shadows:Blair Witch 2. Its about a man who finds a rare piece of footage on the internet that might be his sister who disappeared twenty years back and decides to search for her with is friends only to be targeted by the Blair Witch herself. The film is not a remake if wondering and also if wondering Heather dose not appear in this film and I'm not sure if she is portrayed by another actor I don't remember her being in this. The film was a bit boring a times but apart from that this was an OK film. It had some stupid scenes and some really intense and scary scenes. The ending was really terrifying but at the very very very last minute,not gong to spoil but it was a bit disappointing as if the director didn't put enough effort into it but apart from all of that,Blair Witch is OK.."
" Insultingly bad
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,1,"The wonderful potential of the found footage genre is that it's cheap. However, it requires an intelligent production team to compensate for the low budget and make the thing work. It is an exercise in creativity - at least, it ought to be, if it is to be successful.This film has no ambition to be original in any way. Instead, it throws in everything but the kitchen sink. We have multiple cameras, multiple characters, even a camera drone. We have scares of every description thrown in. Whenever they didn't know what scare to use next, they would just rip off something they saw somewhere else. Thus, there are no rules in this film. It just keeps throwing new things at you, and constantly confusing you. However, one thing becomes crystal clear: this film is total nonsense, and whoever wrote it was lazy and dumb. There is no suspense here, no sense that the script knows where it's going, and absolutely no ambition to create something worth watching. They just ripped off elements from five other films and stuffed them together, just to create enough material to fill the 1h 20min length of this tedious drivel.The screenwriter is so lazy that he doesn't even exploit the elements he introduces. For instance, they bring a drone with a camera, but they never use it for anything. So why bring it, then? And why not exploit this new type of camera? Laziness and lack of screen writing talent."
" Quite and effective and entertaining found footage film.
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"The first one was a huge success, especially because of it's budget thanks to it's marketing. But people have gotten a bit more educated, thanks to technology and networking. So found footage like this won't really have the same impact that it did in 1999. However I thought this was a very creative and unique found footage horror movie. The start is a bit slow, but it didn't seem to drag and I started to get the gist of each characters. The cinematography is actually quite effective and really starts to bring out the eerier, bizarre and creepy vibes. It was felt like I was watching a good ""Silent Hill"" movie, and if ""Silent Hills"" the game actually got made. I have a feeling it would have been similar to this movie. Sure it's a short film, but at no point did I feel that it really started to drag. As a matter of fact the tension kept on building and building. This just didn't seem like a lazy effort at a found footage movie, but it looked like some genuine effort went into it. Overall, I personally think that this is actually quite and effective and entertaining found footage movie that is worth the watch.7.5/10"
" Who are the real heroes of this movie ?
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"Blair Witch takes place in 2014 with he brother of Heather from the original Blair Witch Project, names James. James with his friends enter the forest, but this time to see if they can find the house that his sister was once last seen in, after the search team for his sister and friends found no evidence of a house existing.The simple part of this movie is, the most part of it, it is just Blair Witch Project, but set in the 21st century. They have GPS, Phones, new Cameras and even drones which in the end is as irrelevant as the map that was used in the Blair Witch Project. About half way through this movie does take a different turn and comes into its own, but almost comes so far into its own it rarely relates to the Blair Witch Project in the second half. The Blair Witch in this one, knocks over trees, makes loud stomping sounds and is present without being seen, and even at point does something so drastic its so out of the ordinary to the original movie (will no spoil this). Where as Blair Witch Project you saw nothing and head little besides sticks and leaves, and kind operated like this 'is she supernatural, or just a scary old woods lady, this was most of my problem with this movies.As far as this movie is scary, yes it is scary...but nothing more than due to sound and editing. I know, I know that is a fundamental to horror / scary movies, but this movie actually didn't build much in suspense in plot, but it relied on silence followed by loud (way turned up) scratchy camera sounds, wind blowing into mics and jumpy footage to make you on edge and towards the end became really annoying and left me waiting for that 'moment' again rather than being actually in suspense. In saying that I also understand that this movie has a lot to compete with in trying to be scary with 'found footage' movies, the bar has been raised since 1999 and the genre is almost a dime a dozen these days...but the real heroes of this movie on making it 'some what' quality is the sound and editing team.This movie wont be for everyone. If you are a fan of the first, or fan of the now 'found footage' genre then this will be a fine watch for you. The movie is mostly watered down by a non-involving plot and really a genre there isn't much left you can do with.Thanks for reading, if you want to continue this you can hit me up on Twitter; @ohitsjustadamh"

" Watchable, but barely.
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,4,"First off before I even get started I just want to point out that this movie cost 5 million to make and so far has already made 20 million. I don't think the filmmakers care if we liked it or not. And from what I'm seeing on the reviews I think we can all agree this movie was crap.I think my major issue with the movie is I just don't really see the point. It's very obviously just a cash grab and I'm going to assume that the majority of the five million dollar budget went to marketing with their foolish ""the woods scheme"".Since Blair Witch 1 I have been obsessed with found footage movies and I can tell you right now there are a few B rated movies that are actually freakier than this.I'll stop rambling now and summarize.Badjump scares - illogical story - way too much screaming - story holes (peter? Time travel? Girls foot?) - too much subterfuge instead and no answers lolGood-some cool camera angles -succeeded in achieving the ""being chased"" feeling (almost a con for ruining the original) -good acting for the most partIts a remake. Remake's suck. But I suppose it was watchable. 4/10"
" CInematic Masterclass!
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,5,"Blair Witch had some neat spooks and audio work, but wasn't much to holler home about. Characters were cardboard cutouts and the film itself didn't embrace what made the original work. The increase in characters with cameras made me feel like I was seeing too much. It felt more or less like any other average ole found-footage movie rather than a Blair Witch sequel, which is disappointing considering Adam Wingard is a pretty talented guy that's made solid thrillers like You're Next and The Guest. But hey I'll tell you one thing, the leftover ham in my fridge, which I had thought previously was eaten by my cousin DIno, was delightful and for that reason I'd say it was a most enjoyable experience."
" Bare Witch
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,2,"Why? Why?! Why do you remake a movie when there is absolutely no reason to remake the movie?Blair Witch (2016) is as unimaginative as its title. When the original ""Blair Witch"" was released (way back in 1999) those involved had done a remarkable job at reeling in all the fish they hooked from a cleverly done marketing job, selling the public all sorts of different accounts of a legend, i.e. the Blair Witch. They had their own web site chock full of different ""eye-witness"" accounts, histories, victims--you name it; it was there. However, a real funny thing happened only weeks before the movie premiered. The public was let in on one big secret: the Blair Witch NEVER existed. It had all been a hoax.So, in 2016, you get a production company trying to continue to sell a lie by having a story line that the brother of one of the first ""victims"" (Heather) found a video suggesting his sister may still be alive? Really? Really! After 17 years, she's survived on what? She bathed in the creek, I suppose, and became one with nature. Geez Louise.There was NOTHING new about this movie. Everyone was STILL completely bug-nutz about stick figures, everyone wore a sign reading ""KILL ME NEXT,"" and given all the goings-on from the first venture, nobody thinks to bring a gun. The pretentiousness of the people involved in this big old turd is just mind boggling. The movie is rated ""R"" for those terrifying stick figures, language, and (mostly) off-screen violence. The only reason I did not give the movie a ""1"" was the production values were decent."
" worst than book of shadows
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,2,"If you ever saw V/H/S and like it and never saw The Blair witch project you will like this,if you saw it then you will find this movie disgusting,it has non credible characters and bad acting,doesn't feel not even a bit real,for something that is suppose to be a sequel its so bad made its outrageous.Its full of jump-scares,a creature you can actually see and hear,that's the opposite of the original movie,where you couldn't see a witch,and the supposed witch on this looks more like an alien.There is so much wrong with this movie i cant describe it,its the biggest murder to the franchise so far."
" Completely misses what the original was about.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,2,"Here I was, expecting a continuation to a truly scary ""lost in the woods"" simulator. What I received was a couple of American teenagers getting picked off one by one by the supernatural - as usual in low effort horrors.The Blair Witch Project (1999) was good, because it was trying to be realistic. Heather, Josh and Michael for all their faults weren't lacking chromosomes, unlike the protagonists of the sequel/reboot. James, Lisa, Ashley, Peter, Lane and Talia - each one of them makes 12 y.o children look like master tacticians. One terribly stupid decision follows another.Let me kick around parts of my tent, because I'm a choleric who can't put it up in 5 minutes. Let me just go gather firewood alone, in the middle of the night, losing line of sight with the camp. Let me climb this tree, even though I could barely stand 10 minutes ago, because of the fever and leg wounds. See a creepy dolls hanging around? Oh, look at this one - not only it looks like a human being, but also it has some hair of this crying, scared out of her wits girl. I see no reason I shouldn't snap it in half, dealing with a witch and all.When I saw the preparations - GPS, drones, portable radios I thought I was in for a great, well-written story that despite the wonders of technology will show how helpless a man can be versus nature (and a curse). I wasn't wrong about the last part, but I didn't expect the witch to be a REC-zombie rip-off walking EMP. You know that electronic devices known for their reliability in survival situations? They don't work anymore. Why? F*** you, that's why.It's extremely hard to watch. I considered leaving the theater mid-session, because I felt insulted by just watching it, but I managed to endure it to the end.I felt relief when the last survivor got picked off the same way her friend was few seconds ago. She SAW it happen and then she did the same thing herself nonetheless. ""I'm free now"" I thought ""and nothing of value was lost"".The only reason I didn't grade it with 1 star, is because of my respect for Blair Witch Project (1999). Yeah, it started the whole 'found footage' fad, but it was original and scary for someone who lived near the woods for most of his life."
" Two Major Warnings
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,1,"Guys, I saw that movie yesterday. I think that I have to warn you (people who have not seen that and are planning to watch it some time in the future) about two major things:Warning 1: 95% of the movie is night close shots with a shaking camera to either persons or tree leaves and bushes, shots that will not make you understand anything.Warning 2: 95% of the movie script is just calling out loud the names of the heroes: PETER! JAMES! LISA! etc.I would like to write more but I think there is everything included in the two warnings above.Conclusion: It seems that I eventually lost one and a half hour of my life... pointlessly... meaningless things... better be more cautious next time."
