" Jump scare grudge cemetery
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,3,"A messy collection of many, many jump scares in a mediocre story (reminding me a little too much of pet cemetery), packed with horror clich√©s on an awful music score. The evil character was pretty scary but obviously inspired by the grudge."
" REALLY SURPRISED BY THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!!
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,7,"After reading so many negative reviews as well as some good ones, I really didn't know what to expect. I was honestly prepared for an awful film. I'm a massive horror movie fan, so takes a lot to impress me. I felt this movie had some good original elements to it and naturally some I've seen in other horror movies. It's got all you need from a successful horror movie: slow reveal of a back story, suspense, jumps, scene setting music and so on. I thought this movie was pretty good overall and I've definitely seen FAR WORSE. I even like how it ended. Not a masterpiece but definitely worth a watch in my opinion!"
" Interesting comparisons.
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,7,"It's odd, that so many comparisons are being drawn with Pet Cemetery and none with the premise of 'A Dark Song'.
Effective but nothing startling."
" Tragic Accident
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,10,"The movie story is so spooky and I love it. The movie is great to watch, I'd recommended it."
" If you want horror movie go for it
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,7,The movie is really good for a horror moive & the end of it makes me feel satisfied about the story anout the whole movie its showing you what happened behind that door so I loved how they drew as to the end üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
" Bringing your kids back from the dead is never a good idea
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,5,"Nicely set in India an American family lose their young son in a freak motor accident. Riddled with guilt the mother is told she can speak to him one final time at an ancient Hindu temple, but that she mustn't open the door! Naturally she does.
Pet Sematary springs to immediate mind, substituting an animal for a human. There are a few decent jump scares but, as is so typical of modern horror movies, these soon become cliche and quickly lose their power. The film also goes for a J-Horror look, needless. The shamans are very creepy.
This is a decent watch, just neither remarkable or memorable."
" It wasn't bad
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,6,"I understand why a lot of people are disappointed with this movie, but for die-hard horror fans it's a good way to spend and evening after work, and relax.
It's not gonna scare anyone, that's for sure.
But the story is quite good! Try it. Enjoy it"
" A Great Movie - definitely underrated
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,10,"Great acting, great script, great scenery. Really nicely done! I don't know why this movie is so underrated. As for me I was quite pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone."
" Don't bother opening
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,3,"Your time should be too precious to go through it (the door/the movie). Technically speaking the movie is ok, there is nothing to fault here. But if the inciting incident is so bad, it should make you feel physical pain, there is almost no saving grace. Especially because the story is cliche after cliche after cliche.Now I'm not about to bad mouth the actors (I quite like Jeremy Sisto in general anyway to do that), I'll just state that they didn't or rather couldn't help the matter either. And again, I wouldn't lay blame on them (other than chosing the project in the first place - but hey they needed the money and all that) - don't watch it if you're not a sucker for horror movies in general. And even if you are, there are so many really good ones out there ... or even decent ones that are better than this movie"
" Tedious
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,3,"THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR is another cheap, tedious and digital modern horror movie with a supernatural plot. The main characters are a dull married couple living in India. When their child dies, the mother enlists the use of black magic to bring him back, and of course things don't play out as expected. Sadly this is one of those productions that takes forever to go anywhere, and by the time it does you wish they hadn't bothered. Sarah Wayne Callies is just as annoying as she was in THE WALKING DEAD (and an equally bad parent!) while the major scare scenes just openly rip-off those in THE GRUDGE."
" Horrible
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,1,"Whole movie makes no sense, poor dog had nothing to do with all of that and had to die...disgrace of a horror movie if I've ever seen one"
" Let The Wrong One In
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,3,"It was bearable up until she opened the door, then my review title occurred to me. With 83 prior reviews this may have been said before, but has anyone else noticed the obvious plagiarism of Hammer's 2009 Wake Wood? That, I loved. This falls into insulting stereotypes of Indian people and culture, along with innumerable cliched moments."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,6,"Well made horror movie. nothing special overall but good creepy tone and tense scenes. some very scary parts (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
And I definitely enjoyed the opposite of beginning when the same thing started again with the husband trying to talk to the wife"
" Pet cematary without the atmosphere.
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,4,"This movie is Pet Cemetary, only in a more exotic setting and more poltergeist than undead.It dives right in without the tedious build up to the inevible dead kid. It doesn't do much to make me like the mother though. She's the kind that hates her Husand for being able to be asleep when she has the flashback-dream. It actually advances the plot nicely so it's the rare good use of dreams in this genre.Very cliched. The mystical local women, the warning ""don't open the door"" (I wonder if she will open it...)I appreciate that this movie could be scary if you had never seen a horror movie before. It's like a catalogue of things we've all seen before.No an impressive movie. It tries to be poignant but just ends up being simpering because of lax charcterization."
" feel fake
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,4,"Antique traders Maria (Sarah Wayne Callies) and Michael Harwood (Jeremy Sisto) are struggling after the death of their son Ollie. They live in India with their daughter Lucy. Maria is still haunted by the guilt from Ollie's death and tries to commit suicide. Her housekeeper Piki suggests a way to connect with her son for one last time at an abandoned temple where the line between life and death is blurred. She warns her not to open the door.This is a missed opportunity of mixing western horror with Hindu mysticism. Despite the exotic location shoots, the Indian aspect feels hollow. Like the lead characters themselves, they are looking at it through western eyes. It feels fake. The house and the temple are obvious studio stages but there are touches that make it feel ever like the indoor sets that they are. Quite frankly, Maria could at least dress in local garb. It's detrimental to the establishing of mood. There is a functional ghost story here and it really gets compelling with the child on child possession. Sadly, that happens way too late to save this movie. It's the only part that has the potential of real scares. It's mostly wasted."
" Rating this 6 because it was actually scary!
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,6,"The story was really good. And some scenes were acatully scary. Being a horror movie it did it's job.
First half of the movie is not scary it's just bits of sad scenes.... 2nd half is scary.I like the talking behind the door scene very much.. If only they could have dragged that scene a bit longer and showed us more."
" It could been better..
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,2,The movie was good until we get part when maria played by sarah wayne callies who was in walking dead she played lori grimes she goes to this tomb with out telling her husband she only lives a letter telling him that get alway cause over her death son when she trying say bye to him at tomb this character is very selfish she tried kill self ealier cause she cant deal & has another kid who probably feels alone . i hate this charater .. but other then the frist half was good i was very upset with maria charater maybe they tell her story different why like bringing her husband to the tomb or something..My rateing - 2 stars ill would gave bigger rateing if the maria charater hasnt upset me so much..
" This horror trend has to stop
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,2,"The movie is laughable.The plot is so contrived and none of the characters are believable. The character development goes nowhere. The mother is also, besides hot, not a good actress. With the right manuscript I have seen both of the main actors do well but this is just not working. For me this became a comedy quite a short while into the movie. And not a very good one at that."
" Good, but its lacking something...
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,5,"A good plot, but it somehow feels the film is missing crucial information. It would have been far more effective had they shown the accident scene, instead of just showing it in flash backs. Although the film is very atmospheric, there are very little scares. Some rather effective visual effects. A very good message is being conveyed here, though."
" Dark Ghosts
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,7,"The other side of the Door: A US couple live in Mumbai, running an antique business. Their son drowns in a car accident when the mother (Sarah Wayne Callies) only manages to save the daughter, sort of a Sophie's Choice. Their Indian housekeeper offers Sarah one last chance to speak to her son through a series of rituals, the final one taking place in a ruined Hindu Temple. She must not open the door, only speak to her son's spirit through it. But of course she opens it. ""Mommy, Oliver is back."" 7/10."
" Not your typical horror, suspense and tension.
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,8,"Horror fans after shock scares, gore and sheer terror will find this a disappointment, it's a horror, but subtle in its delivery, it boasts a sinister plot, plays on fears, and delivers its scares with purpose.Instead of the typical British or American creaky house, we're transported to India, and its colours and sunshine, it certainly makes you see a horror film differently.It's well acted, well produced, I don't know why, but I kept thinking of the Woman in Black, that kind of delivery. For the first forty minutes very little happens, we get back story, plot, but little action, it's more creepy then scary.Not for everyone, but I enjoyed it."
" Mummy will be mad
",2018-02-20 00:00:00,6,"Michael (Jeremy Sisto) and Maria (Sarah Wayne Callies) have given up the city that never sleeps to live in India, the part that looks like paradise and doesn't have all those third world beggars. Maria has trouble coping with the loss of her son Oliver (Logan Creran) who she accidentally drowned Susan Smith style. She is informed on how to talk to her son one last time, by going to a remote temple only known to the locals and those with Google Earth. Here the boundary between the living and dead is weak. After spreading Oliver's ashes and waiting until night, she can speak to Oliver through a door, which she is instructed never to open. She gets it all correct, except for maybe that one thing, which you would know if you are old enough to read the title.Soon they have visitations which are initially pleasant and then formula. The film was meh up until the last 10 minutes which were great.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. The ""R"" and BCFF 15 ratings I consider a bit high."
" The Other side of the Door
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,6,"I find it very funny so many disliked the film maybe because it has no real graphic horror or sexual content that most of the critiques seem to need to enjoy a simple ghost story. This may not be the best ghost story ever told but it has plenty of creepy & atmospheric moments & a great ending. To many horror buffs can't just enjoy a story without sex & graphic gore they aren't really fans of the genre & i fail to see why they are so surprised when she opens the door when told not to ,it's like to body under the sheet you dont want to look but but still you have to. This is not a bad film & the story though it's been told before like in Pet Cemetery love make people that are grieving do things they shouldn't do . I enjoyed the film from the perspective of ghost story's & though it may not be the best ghost tale ever told these comments of hate are as lame as can be."
" don't trust the bad reviews
",2018-01-12 00:00:00,8,"I just watched this movie with my wife and we enjoyed it. my wife says it's a bit too scary for her. :) Loved the setting of India. It creates a more mysterious story due to the place being foreign. The special effects were great and the movie kept me interested start to finish. So creepy when oliver took over lucy's body and stabbed the father. This horror film deserves no less than a 7 rating in my opinion, so to counter so much unfair criticism I decided to give this an 8!"
" I enjoyed the movie, though it may not be for everyone.
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this movie a great deal, though I will be the first to admit there are plot holes and inconsistencies. The movie did not always follow their own rules in regards to how spirits act, and it was frustrating at one point towards the end of the movie. However, I enjoyed the story element of the movie, and enjoyed that there was a general vibe of sadness and creepiness, and not as many jump scare moments. Personally I prefer that type of experience from a horror movie, and was happy to have watched this movie."
" Decent enough but does have some flaws
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,6,"After the death of their son, a couple living in Mumbai trying to cope learn a mystical way of bringing them back to communicate with them again only to find that something sinister is following them home and must find a way of stopping the spirits' influence on them.This one wasn't that bad if an altogether decent supernatural affair. One of the few great parts about this one is the fact that it manages to get the conditions and practices of the ceremony into the story rather nicely. The way it details the instructions specifically, from the manner of how to get there and what to do when they arrive and in what precise order it must be carried out in order to work properly, these are all handled quite well and gives this the kind of set-up which brings the scenes in the temple itself their inherent creepiness. By going through the motions of retrieving the ashes, arriving and preparing the candles and the layout of the ceremonial trinkets that are prepared for the start of the ritual inside which is quite creepy and works due to these early set-ups as well as the details of the temple itself. Once it comes back to the rather impressive supernatural details later on, this one is even better with the series of rather chilling events showing the demonic spirit tormenting her and her family out in the slums of the city or the series of rather tense confrontations in their home which are rather fun and chilling from the accidental death in their backyard or the battle in the kitchen with the possessed individual. With so many of these scenes featuring the rather creepy and chilling looking designs of the spirits taken directly from Hindu folklore for their appearance, this makes for a much more shocking look that really helps this one, this one manages to really get some impressive elements here although it does have it's fair share of sizable flaws. The main one here is the fact that so much of what happens here doesn't have the slightest bit of interest here as it's just not that chilling or scary to go through the rather bland scenes of their marital problems or her physical condition which manifests itself following her return. There's way too much melodrama in this part which doesn't come off in the slightest bit interesting following the stellar opening half with the accident and the ceremony, so that dip really appears obvious with some really troubling and bland scenes that feature the wholly expected jump scares of shrieking ashen-faced specters only she can see that are just so expected and clich√©d that they're not even that worthy of generating the jump. That becomes a recurring theme here where it tends to rely on this clich√©d look and topic for the vast majority of it's scares and it really becomes old after awhile not only seeing the same type of scares but going through the motions again. Likewise, the other big problem area here is the fact that the ending is somewhat abrupt and just seems to end really without warning, stopping and just rolling credits which somewhat neuters the effects just shown beforehand. Otherwise, this one wasn't all too terrible overall.Rated R: Violence, Language, children-in-jeopardy and implied animal violence."
" the overall CGI tears it down
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,6,"The idea of making a horror in India looks promising because you can add culture and believe into the story. And they actually did but the problem I had with this flick wasn't the story itself.I had issues with the effects used and not being scary at all. In the beginning of the flick the first scary moment is done with CGI so for me it was clear that this wasn't going to be my thing. It isn't scary at all even as they put in a creature that reminded me of so many Asian horrors, the long haired crawling girl. As said, the story is rather okay with the temple and the occult being added towards the story. But overall it's except for the drowning all done CGI wise. The last 10 minutes are the best part but again, for me the CGI used pushed away the scary part. It's not one for the real horror geeks but I can understand that teens will like it because it fits perfectly in the Anabelle's and Conjurings of this time being.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5"
" This is one Oliver who doesn't need an army.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,6,"Directed by Johannes Roberts and Roberts co-writes the screenplay with Ernest Riera. It stars Sarah Wayne Callies, Jeremy Sisto, Sofia Rosinsky and Suchitra Pillai.Still struggling to come to terms with the death of her young son, Maria (Callies) is told of an Indian ritual where she can say goodbye to her son one last time, under one condition. The condition is that the conversation will be on the other side of a door - a door which simply must not be opened...There were far worse horror films than this released in 2016, that's not to say this should be a selling point for The Other Side of the Door, but it at least is effective in what it does. The problems really are that it's all very clich√© ridden, but how many horror films do not have clich√©s anyway? This is one for those who are just after a few genuine scares, some creeping dread like atmosphere, and a nifty ending. It doesn't tread any new ground, and it comes off like the bastard child of Ringu and Pet Sematary, but sometimes a safe horror with clich√©s is all you need for a decent night in with the lights off. 6.5/10"
" Nonsensical and insulting
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,3,"I've found the movie to be a very poor attempt at horror. Not because of acting or effects but the scenario the movie suggests. -SPOILERS AHEAD-So to quickly sum up the story, a mother is tormented by the loss of her son in a tragic(?) car accident. She was driving the car, had to chose between one of her two children, chose the daughter and now guilt and sorrow are eating away at her. She attempts suicide because the loss in unbearable, learns of a ritual to have contact with her son for one last goodbye and is given an extremely simple set of instructions to follow for said ritual, which of course she doesn't follow. Evil is unleashed, bad things happen to her family and the movie ends with the ""some things should be left undisturbed"" morale hanging in the air. -SPOILERS END-The mother is so laughably unstable and unlikable (again, this is a writing issue, not a cast or acting issue), that i felt really bad she didn't actually take her own life. The movie is plagued by the classical clich√©s of all horror movies, from contrived reasons to do things to nonsensical or illogical behavior on the part of the characters. DO NOT RECOMMEND 3/10TLDR: You're better off wasting your time on something better."
" I am still nostalgic about The Sixth Sense!!
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"I remember going to the movie theater to watch ""The Sixth Sense"" by M. Night Shyamalan. I was not expecting a lot, no bias since I had not read any review and I was the first among my friends and family to watch it, so really good to be total unaware in a movie like that. Looking back, it is unbelievable that just turned the calendar to 2017. 2017!!! So, The Sixth Sense is almost reaching ""the legal age"". It is actually 18 in my country! And absolutely I have not watched a better movie of this genre ever since. Some horror movies are actually gore. Others are so clich√© it is not worthy watching 5 minutes.This movie was so poorly made I can't understand that happens. It looks like some kid wrote it. They exaggerated in many of the scenes just pure nonsense and nothing adding up a good ghost story, it is even hard to rate this and be simple but I will try: ""It is a bad horror movie"". Just bad! Five is already a good rate for this. I am happy I saw it on TV and not in the theater."
" Pet Semetary made in India.
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,5,"""What if I could bring your son back to you just one more time? What if I could give you the chance to say your final goodbye?""""The other side of the door"" is not really a bad movie. Technically speaking it really looks magnificent at certain moments. Moreover, India as location and the used ancient ritual sure made for a unique starting point. But ultimately it was only a collection of all sorts of previously used ideas. I thought it felt a bit outdated. That wouldn't be such a huge problem if there was a certain tension or creepiness. Unfortunately, this was also missing, making it once again a horror that never exceeded mediocrity.The story reminded me of ""Pet Semetary"" with the loss of a child and the desire to bring it back to life again. In ""The Other Side of the door"" Michael (Jeremy Sisto) and Maria (Sarah Wayne Callies) decided in an impulsive moment to stay in Bombay and to found a family. Years later we see how they have settled there, living in an idyllic looking house somewhere in downtown Bombay and their lives being enriched by the presence of their daughter Lucy (Sofia Rosinsky) and the typical family dog ‚Äã‚ÄãWinston. However, it's not entirely rosy because of the tragedy that occurred in the past, with the death of their son Oliver (Logan Creran) as a result. Maria is tormented daily by guilt and grief. Fortunately, Piki (Suchitra Pillai) the housekeeper has a grandiose idea. The things needed to fulfill this idea are the ashes of the deceased child, an old dilapidated temple and a nightly sleepover there. This could bring relief to Maria's heavy psychological problem. But obviously there's a golden rule that shouldn't be violated. And of course it's clear that is definitely going to happen anyway. Now we're off to a kind of ""The Conjuring"" made in India. All kinds of objects suddenly start to move around and ghostly apparitions appear and reappear in the background. And for the umpteenth time we get a self-playing piano. And for God's sake, when is anybody going to pay attention to the warnings of the dog. First the phenomenon is the kindness itself. Afterwards it turns out to be fairly aggressive again. Nothing new either. And just like in ""Lights Out"", the solution to the problem is the relationship between the caring mother and the ghostly presence. Again so predictable. Throw in some primitive painted Indian folkloric figures, called the Aghori who practice rather peculiar rituals so they can communicate with spirits in the afterlife, and it's complete. Those Aghori are creepy individuals appearing out of nowhere and producing an annoying, mesmerizing sound. But they aren't as scary as Myrtu who suddenly begins to interfere with the whole affair. It's a creature from the underworld that looks terrifying enough. I think they've used the ""stop-motion"" technique for this one (also an obsolete special effect). For me this was probably the most positive part of the film.All in all, it's just an old-fashioned ghost story that didn't take place in an American old mansion to my relief, but in dark India instead where the mystic about afterlife and primitive rituals are still alive among the elderly population. Clearly modern Western people shouldn't experiment with such rituals. It's nothing earth shattering, but it's not bad either. Though expect a few strategically placed jump scares and a thoughtful ending. More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
" A tragedy
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"I agree with another review I read here - that this is more tragedy than horror. If you judge this as a horror movie, then yes, it's not that scary. It has the occasional jump scares here and there and the occasional creepy looking ghost/spirit woman but other than that, it's not scary. But it is tragic, and if you look at the story-line, it's very relatable.A mother loses her child in a car accident and blames herself for it. She learns of an ancient ritual to contact him, locking herself up in an old temple to do so. She is warned not to open the door at any time, no matter what she hears. But of course, in her desperation to see her lost son, she does open the door. This is about coping with a loss and the consequences that come from playing with the other world. It's not a brand new and novel idea, but the way it is portrayed is quite convincing. It's in a beautiful backdrop of a remote part of India as well, which gives the film an ethereal kind of feeling.8/10, honestly for me."
