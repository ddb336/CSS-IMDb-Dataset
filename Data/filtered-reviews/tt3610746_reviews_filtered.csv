" Hang up, just... hang up.
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,3,"Pros:
Garrett Clayton and Gregg Sulkin make a hot pair of himbos and their scenes sitting on the couch are kinda hot.
Blood and gore supplied!Cons:Plot. None. Bored college boys prank call people telling them severely distressing things and record it for lolz. Eventually someone retaliates and spends an evening terrorising them. Even with an impressive kill rate, the holes in the plot stretch credulity to past breaking point: the lights and electricity keep going on and off (suspiciously at dramatic moments) but no one ever thinks to check the house for intruders? Are all electrical appliances now linked to the internet? Bodies move in and outside the house through closed doors. Are they all deaf? The back door is barely a ten second shuffle from the sitting room. Characters are advised to call the police and seek shelter, so of course they run back to the scenes of the crime and hang about waiting to be killed off instead of alerting neighbours.Twists. Every twist has been done better elsewhere: Mother's Day, the Saw Series, When A Stranger Calls, Urban Legend and others are all referenced in some way or another and this movie just proves that they all did it better. Mr. Lee, the killer of this film, has all the charisma of Michael Myers attempting stand up. What's worse, Mr. Lee communicates mainly through the telephone, with a voice that sounds like an anime VA reject.As a vehicle for the two stars, this is probably useful for their careers in eventually winning MTV teen awards, but overall a massive misstep and dreadful addition to the horror genre."
" Could have been better...
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,5,"The ending twist could have been way better. It should been the girlfriend, Peyton, that set up a grand prank on Sam. The ending makes me think that the writer, Joe Johnson, got pranked/picked on a lot growing up... because moral of the movie's story is don't prank people. It's kinda dumb if you think about it. I ranked it a 5 out of 10 only because the beginning and middle of the movie kept me intrigued."
" Had low expectations, was pleasantly surprised
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,6,"While I didn't have high hopes for this one, I was actually pretty pleasantly surprised.I will admit the first act was a little rough, but it ramped up towards the second to a fairly entertaining level. I appreciated the use of a subtle but effective score, and the writing wasn't bad either.The acting was a little all over the place at times, and the characters weren't likeable; though I didn't really expect either coming into this, so it didn't ruin it. It also got fairly predictable pretty quickly, but that didn't really ruin it.If you don't go in with high expectations, you should have a pretty good time."
" Good thriller for movie night
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,7,"This is your typical teens out-of-control acting stupid movie in which their antics catch up with them. There are some interesting twists and scares throughput the movie that will hold your interest and the characters are likable and believable enough to make it enjoyable.
Definitely not an award winning film, but if you just want a fun watch with thriller/suspense for a typical movie night flick this will not disappoint. It's actually a pretty decent movie."
" Better than I expected
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,6,"Ok, I'll be honest in saying that I had absolutely no expectations with this movie and I will admit that it was better than I thought it would be. I expected some b movie with hideous acting and no plot, but luckily this was significantly better.The problem with these types of films is that it's very one dimensional. You have the 2 characters and then the bloke on the phone and that's it. So at the end of the day there is only so much you can do with that and towards the back end I did feel my concentration levels dropping, but none the less I did find the plot to be interesting enough, it kept a good amount of suspense throughout and they did a good job of adding layers to the characters.BRIEF SPOILER AS I TALK ON THE ENDINGNow I won't go into any details, but I wasn't a fan of the ending. The ""baddie"" who's face we don't even see wins so you get this unsatisfied emotion when the final scene happens. This is a personal preference but I just feel like a good ending could have happened. There was no major reveal or anything and you could kind of guess who it would be by the midway point anyway. I just found the end to be annoying and unfulfilling.The film contains a lot of gore and a lot of suspense so it'll definitely please a lot of horror fans. It's not a film you'll shout and scream about at all. Another reason that just sprang to mind is that it contains a lot of classic horror cliches and so on which I can make parts predictable. But overall it's a fun film that kept me entertained and didn't dwindle about. It just got stuck into what we want to see. Gotta rate that."
" Great plot, great scares, great horror movie
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,9,The plot was so great. I love a movie with a great plot and you don't often get that in horror movies. It was scary and tense with lots of suspense. Everything made sense in it unlike many other horror movies. The acting was great and I don't understand why this movie is only scoring 5.6. It is really worth watching and shows the dangers and consequences of pranks and online blogging.
" Cant stand the pretty boy actors
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,3,"The actors make it hard to like this movie. I literally rooted for the ""bad"" guy the whole time."
" Pass the time
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,5,"Brady....Brady...Brady.
The acting was horrible. I couldn't stand it. The ending justified what Mr.Lee had been through. Very sad."
" Great film
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,8,It's been done before but it is a good film and I like it that they have taken it into the future with online pranks etc even if it is a 2016 movie.
" Prank gone wrong...!!!
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,6,"3 guys do prank with random peoples and upload into internet...one day they got call from a stranger and he tries to prank with them but it seems very horrible..
Worth watchable.."
" Predictable, and yet, watchable
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,5,"Nothing we haven't seen before. A little bit predictable but still, can be fun watching on a rainy night..."
" A very engaging Thriller ,Dont listen bad reviews
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,10,"I enjoyed this movie a lot, was very engaging Intense not get bore for a minute, typical but thought provoking story for Losers prank people( prank culture cause problem many time for innocent)& soo surprised why many bad reviews? Infact many people have bad habit always speak bad for good"
" Witless
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,3,"DON'T HANG UP is a pretty awful slice of low budget horror with perhaps the two most awful and dislikeable protagonists I've seen in any movie. It's a tired old riff on the old WHEN A STRANGER CALLS type plotline, with prank calls spelling disaster for a couple of lads when they try to prank the wrong person. Mind games are interesting at first, but then this descends into typical slasher fare and becomes a witness exercise in attempted scares. They don't work."
" it's good but
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,8,"Great film overall, good acting & good story plot the only thing that disappoints me in this movie is the fact i knew what was going to happen before it happened, very predictable but good."
" Don't pass this by if you're after a reasonable time filler
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,6,"""Don't"" movies, almost a genre in themselves. Mainly horror or thrillers they go back to at least the 1970's, Don't Answer the Phone, Don't Go in the House and Don't go in the Woods.... Alone! being some of the more notorious titles. Don't Hang Up, along with Don't Breathe, is a far more recent entry. A pair of teenage pranksters pull a prank too far and they themselves become the pranked, unfortunately for them it is by a murderous psycho who knows a great deal about them. Queue potholes - exactly how did he manage to gain all this personal information, and more to the point how did he manage to seemingly install secret cameras in the home of one of the boys? If you can overlook details such as these then what we have is a fairly decent suspense horror, original it is not but that doesn't matter. How many slasher movies are original? As a Brit one things that really gets under my skin is European movies trying to pass themselves off as American. I didn't realise that this was a British movie until later when I looked it up on the site, so despite a cast that includes Europeans they did a good job.The running time of 83 minutes pass well, it is no masterpiece that's for sure but despite its lack of originality I found it a reasonably good watch."
" Don't pick it up.
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,3,"I can see a strong scream inspiration, so if you're into this kind of movies go straight to the original movie. The intro scene I found particularly annoying (maybe that's what it was meant to be to set the stage?) the main part is in my POV heavy handed and cliche loaded. The on screen protagonists do a lot of sobbing and bro' talk but this did not help me to build a connection. So in the end i did not care about any of the characters. This said, the ending raised my rating a bit as it was on a small scale original."
" Excellent , suspenseful and different
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,9,"There are countless movies where we get the damsel in distress or damsels. In this completely suspenseful, under-rated horror film the film makers dare to put the 2 handsome guys in distress and it totally works. This isn't the type of movie based in any type of reality, most horror films aren't but the writers and director here understand horror. Creepy, disturbing, very suspenseful and expertly acted by Greg Sulkin and Garrett Clayton, I have seen this several times over the years and enjoy it completely every time. One of the best things about this movie is it does not cop out, not even in the end, which I won't give away, but it's perfect. The movie is also shot to perfection, great music and sound effects, interesting camera angles. Great film and a must watch for anyone who appreciates a well done thriller."
" Unknown caller
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,6,"Prank calls - not a fan. And I'm not just talking about being the passive part of it (the ""victim""), but also doing it myself to others. Or generally understanding why one would think this would be funny. It's actually pretty mean. Now does that warrant retaliation? Does that warrant what happens and might possibly happen to the ones involved here? Even if you'd agree to a certain degree to that notion, you wouldn't like the overall scale/scope this extends to.Having said all that, the thriller aspect of it works quite decent and there is enough tension to keep you on the edge of your seat from a certain point forward. I got no love lost for the main characters, which undermines a bit of their struggle or my caring for it. I do care for other people involved that had nothing to do with it ... And then there is the twist ... the reasoning. I would say it works, but you also have to suspend your disbelief when it comes to a certain ""stabbing"" incident ... but that's me. Sometimes in the heat of the fight ... well things don't go the way you'd expect ... or maybe they do just that"
" Fun slasher film
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,7,Fun slasher film that gives some high school kids some of there own medicine.
" Rooted for the killer....
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,8,"I don't give a crap about any of these obnoxious characters
so I'll give 8 stars for the killer wiping everyone out and leaving one to root in prison for the crimes...."
" Peaks & Valleys
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,7,"I threw this on randomly the other evening. Being a massive fan of SCREAM the killer utilizing the phone to torment the main victims went a long way for me. Some unique moments of trickier from the killer. A great cold opening that has a great full circle moment. Bad acting went both ways it had me laughing but also trying to anticipate ploy twists. I don't think you'll hate it. Press play, CHECK IT OUT!"
" The film is not so good, but it is not so bad.
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,5,"Boring. The film exaggerates too much on the issue of technology. The antagonist is super cliché. I was not scared at all, nor did I even recognize scenes that they were meant to be. Weak soundtrack but with good actors. A weak script but good cinematography. At the beginning there were scenes that, honestly, gave me cardiac arrhythmia hahaha! But it breaks the mood with this premeditation. In short, the film is not so good, but it is not so bad."
" Not the best but certainly not the worse by a long shot
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,7,"REVIEW - DON'T HANG UPYouTube is full of videos of people doing prank on one another, some are harmless and some not, the biggest problem I've always had with pranks are the after effects or what happened afterwards.This film is entirely about this premise. A group of kids decide to prank call people unfortunately whilst undertaking one such prank call the unthinkable happens.One day 2 from the group receive a prank call themselves or is it?The television comes on to show them a couple tied to chairs and they are told not to hang up or they die.Through a series of plot twists they are turned against each other until.....Interesting little story especially the reveal at the end which honestly had my jaw on the floor and saying aloud, noooo!Not the best but certainly not the worse by a long shot.Rating 7 out of 10"
" Worth it just to see karma at work.
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,5,"Don't Hang Up is pretty much just another average trek into the teen slasher genre and while it's obviously not the best one, it does have it's moments of infrequent mild suspense and reasonable enjoyment. Note how I say ""mild"" and ""reasonable"" because it does struggle to get past this, especially with a lot of the characters being so annoying.After the first few minutes, we're introduced to the main (instantly unlikable) characters who obviously get their rocks off by carrying our moronic & childish pranks. I don't know if I'm the only one or not, but I instantly wished a speedy karma on them, and we obviously get that with this movie. I don't think there was one victim of Me. Lee's that I really felt sympathy for, apart from the innocent few who were dragged into his plan of revenge. Of course, two wrongs don't make a right, but it's hard to drum up any kind of disdain for what the killer doesAs with a lot of slashers, the plot line is somewhat thin and predictable, but even with the predictability there, it's still a decent enough trip made that much better just to see the main trio of Sam, Brady and Mosley get their comeuppance (there's that karma I mentioned earlier).Not an in-depth review, but there's not much to go in-depth on here. If you don't mind teen slasher flicks then you could do worse than this."
" Another Bunch of Bad Nuisances Receiving Their Part
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,6,"Three guys are doing really bad pranks on harmless people via phone. And then there comes the one guy who is much worse than the three ugly guys, putting them into his own game. It's not only a clichee, it's also long winded on some parts of the movie. The beginning of the film was interesting, but the more the story continued, the more predictable the movie was. If I didn't saw so many movies with that kind of storyflow, I may have given the movie a better note. I would predict that movie to people who finally want to see some horror movies, but didn't see much in the past. I was entertained for a time, but at some point the movie coudln't tie me to the screen anymore. It was obvious what will happen."
" Ending was absolutely unfair!
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,1,That dude didn't deserve what came upon him. All the laws of the universe went against that dude. Could've been such a good movie if the movie did not end like that.
" Hang up
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,2,"Interesting intro but thats about it, the characters were annoying teenagers, pretty simple predictable plot with cliche horror trophys. I didn't have any expectations and maybe it was for the better. The Mr. Lee could have more intimidating or creepy voice, it kind of wasn't that scary. Maybe that was the point then."
" Familiar troupes / Unique perspective
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,8,"Honestly, I'm shocked this film isn't rated higher than it is. It seems that most negative reviews have to do with the familiar plot but, c'mon folks, if only 100% original movies were to be produced, there'd be one movie made every ten years or so; almost *everything* has been done at some point or other. Should Carpenter have not made HALLOWEEN because BLACK CHRISTMAS and FRIGHT came before it? Should Kubrick have not made THE SHINING because other haunted house movies predated it? Is THE WALKING DEAD and virtually every other zombie TV show or movie not derivative of Romero's films?
For me, it's not the originality of the plot that matters but how well the film is executed that matters and, in my opinion, DON'T HANG UP was executed extremely well. Forget that the basic plot has been done before. Suspend your imagination, follow the story for what it is, and this is one fun, entertaining, and enjoyable horror movie.
On an academic scale, I give this film a solid B+"
" *Dramatic zoom out* BROS FOR LIFE
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,1,"Am I meant to like these characters? I've seen this woman for 2 minutes, she literally just comes in and kisses a guy. Am I meant to care about her? Who tf is the pizza guy, why do I care he's dead? Who tf is is prank monkey?
Wtf are these camera pans, they're god awful
Summary:
-10 minutes into the film I predicted they'd end with a news report about how this was a bad situation; surprise, it does.
-30 minutes into the film I predicted the killers motives
-""Bros for life""
-a pinnacle moment in the film, where our CHAD of the film is dying, what does the victim say? ""Bros for life"" I BURST OUT LAUGHING
-the most god damn obvious plot twists which will only surprise those that have watched at max 2 thrillers, why did OUR CHAD, wearing the villains outfit, try swinging at our main character??
-I swear you should never EVER in a horror/thriller have a zoom out camera pan it looks god awful and comical. The literal last scene is a zoom out of the main character, who REFUSED TO DROP THE WEAPONS INCRIMINATING HIM, look up at the sky dramatically, no joke.This is awful, just awful. Awful cinematography, awful characters, awful horror, cringy script, awful plot twists, awful plot, awful killer or whatever he is.BROS FOR LIFE"
" As bad as it gets
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,1,"From the very opening you hope that the bad guy wins and is able to inflict as much pain as possible on the protagonists.
Cliche after cliche, bad acting and plot holes the size of the empty space in the writers brain.
Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, I'd go as far as saying that anyone who enjoyed this movie should re-evaluate whether their existence on this earth is necessary."
" Everything you think will happen, happens.
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,4,"It's ok I guess, a standard ""switch off your brain"" and fart until you're happy. The acting is passable, the story is as you'd expect and the characters are so generic that you can predict their story arch's and actions well before the story gives anything away
There's some really cool cinematography and the production was clearly professional.So yeah, not good, not bad, just ugly.
Just how I like em."
" Oh God why !?
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,1,I cannot believe that people are rating this highly!!! This movie is awful!! Horrible acting and very predictable!! I wish I had picked something else to watch tonight.
" Best Horror in 2016! You reap what you sow!
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,10,"I was thrilled & on the edge of my seat the whole time!Definately worth watching! In this movie the heroes actually are the bad guys by pranking people causing them trouble...i won't say another word , go a head and enjoy it!"
" All the Logan Pauls of the world should experience this
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,7,"Entitled brats ruining social media, what's new. They are like cancer, having fun at the expense of others. I have seen a mother scaring her little child to near death just because of ratings and people seem to love that. Because of the hatred that I have for these kind of self-absorbed morons I give this movie a 7/10, when the movie itself is very mediocre and you can guess what happens next. But the story is so fitting to this time, that I have no other choice. The acting is decent and some of the camera work and effects are actually pretty smooth, so even when you ignore everything else, you can say that the movie is shot well. So this is in no means time wasted."
" act
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,9,Garrett and Gregg are very bad actors.Especially Gregg
" Good film, nothing spectacular, but good
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,6,6/10 for me. Good storyline/ plot. Worth a watch. Don't go in with huge expectations and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Quite enjoyed the ending.
" Predictable and not scary
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,1,"I understand some people calling this a throwback to slasher films of the 80s but I don't agree with them. They can still be actually scary.The opening clips already make me go for the ""sadistic stranger"", these ""it's just a prank bro"" teenagers are believable but doesn't make them good at acting or otherwise. I didn't have any connection or interest with the characters that I was supposed to, which only made me anticipate their demise more eagerly. Unfortunately waiting for their comeuppance isn't interesting no matter how much intense music plays or attempts at jump scares are made.I will say that the camera work was really good, some classic horror/thriller angles as well as some good tension building with obscured shots and zooms, I think this is what makes me see the classic 80s slasher in this film.The blood wasn't the right colour and the dripping blood on the wall looked like someone's attempt at drip painting rather than someone bleeding onto the wall, no smear marks from them falling either? I laughed out loud many times and checked how much longer often. The voice of the ""sadistic stranger"" wasn't threatening or scary in any way to me and almost every step is predictable.This was recommended to me on Netflix so often that I gave in and watched hoping to surprised but that was not the case."
" Everything You're Looking For
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,8,"The point of watching a horror/ thriller is to get your heart racing, your muscles tense, and your adrenalin goes through the roof. Don't Hang Up succeeds to master all of these feelings throughout the movie.This film took a different approach compared to other thriller/ horror films today. Instead of the antagonist killing random people, he is selectively killing those he decides to kill for a very clear purpose (don't want to give away any spoilers)!!This movie had me on the edge of my couch from the start to the finish. Great 21st century approach to this film. The lesson- what you do has consequences!"
" Good ol' fashioned teenage gore.
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,8,"Psy-Ko your review was spot on. Sometimes you just want to see scared kids, a machete or an ax or a sword or a cursed pike, a scream or three or ten, a plot twist or two, and that's it. I appreciate the artistic horror flicks but on occasion I would rather kick back on the couch and watch the kids run for it. You nailed it."
" Entertaining
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,2,"It's a fun watch. By the books. Nothing too surprising for anyone who's watched more than a handful of horror flicks. But, you may not be surprised to hear, it is not an objectively great movie by any means. The biggest problem is the setup is superficial and by the time it all hits the fan, we simply do not care about these characters enough. None of them.Good for a fun watch. And, nowadays, that may be the most we can expect."
" Average Horror Flick
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,5,"Nothing stood out to me as particularly ""Good"" or ""Bad"" in this film. It was just another horror movie, although it brought a somewhat original premise (I use the word original loosely). Ultimately I was left unsatisfied in the end."
" Am I the only one who loves this movie?!
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,8,"Sure, the caller had a few times he was too good with tech (hacking phones so they can't call police) but overall I think it's a great movie. One of the few new horror movies that kept my attention."
" Prank calls don't pay
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,5,"A formulaic, pointless story of teenagers behaving badly and get their comeuppance. It's a disappointing film for how it progresses from a decent enough premise and set up to plot devices which don't ring true - the technology required to trick the young people is not plausible. The characters are drawn thinly and there isn't much tension which is a let down. All in all, it's watchable to the finish but it has a predictable ending."
" Something old, nothing new, many things borrowed, still worth a view
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,5,"I had no idea what to expect from this movie, which in hindsight is funny because once I started watching it I knew EVERYTHING that was going to happen. A lot of reviewers liken it to 'Saw', but I don't really see it so much, other than the revenge theme. But it 'borrows' a great deal from 'Scream', to the point that it sounded like the same guy on the phone. So between Saw, Scream, and a multitude of 80's slasher flicks, I didn't really find a single innovation to the story. But like another reviewer said, ""at least it doesn't use found footage"".The Good:
Decent acting, good camera work, good fast pace, high-quality production, entertaining and suspensefulThe Bad:
Obnoxious millennial character stereotypes, tired plot twistsIn summary: 
While this movie is basically a stereotype from beginning to end, with every twist and turn taken from a past movie, it is still efficient enough in it's storytelling, and has enough suspense to maintain your interest until the end.My recommendation:
I wouldn't go out of my way to see it, but if you have the time and the Amazon membership, there are worse movies you could watch. However, if you have a choice, go back and rewatch 'Scream', or watch 'Hush' instead."
" A 5 but one more star for the effort
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,6,"One thing is for sure ... This movie will catch you by surprise, one way or another.
Since no one can match the original Scream, not because it was a masterpiece per se, but because of the ingenuity that came to define it, you would expect a film that attempts to imitate the aforementioned classic, to be full with clever twists and scary scenes that keep you glued to your chair. It Really doesn't do that, but the effort is there so I would say that it wasn't a waste of time. If you're not into the genre that much, you might even love it. But since I'm writing this review, most if not all the ""clever twists"" are not clever or authentic and as a viewer I have to admit that I was expecting them. The subtlety of the friends inquiry about the relationships status exists, but somehow the affair becomes crystal clear. This is a major twist that the creators failed to keep under wraps. The whole idea crumbles when you realize that basically all the kids that died have received a threat online in the form of a friend request that can easily identify the grieving father as a prime suspect, but one can point out the killers savvy tech nature as a cancelling out factor.What really ruined it for me, is the effort to enforce their idea onto the viewers by any means necessary, like the final scene where one friend kills the other. If he somehow managed to remote control a teenage boy, then I can't really see that happening. The extreme use of several tricks other films introduced into cinema is off course another minus ...Introducing many elements keeps the audience intrigued, but it's a two-edged sword. Even if you believe that the killer planned the whole thing to perfection and waited for the right moment, he couldn't have known the boys were to order pizza, thus delivering him two of the main characters, or that the girl, who's an absolute must plot wise, were to get delivery duties by her boss, because the delivery man called sick.All and all, the foundations are there, the effort is also present, so if you got nothing better to do and you like the genre, go for it ..."
" What a pleasant surprise this fast-paced slasher.
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,6,"Maybe it's time for someone like me...
to come over there and wipe that smug grin off your face.You know what's fun sometimes? Haphazardly starting a film without knowing what it is about and afterward admitting you were pleasantly surprised. That's my experience with this film. A film with a bit of suspense and tension. And thanks to the short playing time you don't have the feeling it was a waste of time. Even though it isn't a blockbuster. It's also the first time that I didn't feel sorry for the two teenagers Sam (Gregg Sulkin) and Brady (Garrett Clayton). In this movie, these two spoiled, annoying brats reap what they have sown. And the whole time I was expecting the rest of the gang to pop up suddenly and announce it was all one big joke.Like many others, I found the two main actors irritating. But then you have to admit their acting was masterful. Because wasn't that the whole point? After all, they are two obnoxious young boys who pull pranks on others. They make extreme prank calls. The only thing I couldn't believe was the fact that those pranks were watched so massively after posting them online. Is that a reflection of what our society is evolving into? A society where gloating is self-evident?""Don't hang up"" is a low-budget film. That's noticeable. Everything takes place mainly in the parental home of Sam. The camera work is uncomplicated but to-the-point. Besides a camera moving through the set in a penetrating way, it generally looks mediocre. It gets bloody in this film, but the used ""practical effects"" don't look spectacular either. And yet this film was worth a watch and can easily be added to a whole series of other films from the same mid-level.Because of the short playing time, the pace is swift in this movie and you don't have to wait long before the unwanted caller turns up. And still despite the pace, one manages to increase the tension gradually. The sinister caller has a rather frightening voice (a Jigsaw-like tone), which in turn makes it extra creepy. His technological omnipotence was slightly exaggerated though. And despite the fact that it's about pretty arrogant and unsympathetic youth, I found the friendship and expression of sacrifice commendable. But all in all, I couldn't avoid gloating and a convincing inner ""Yes!"" resounded at the end."
" Quite bad.
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,3,Extremely unrealistic and over the top. The killer is seemingly some super computer hacker and demi-god.
" This may be the worst movie I've ever seen
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,3,"Terrible horror, crappy jump scares, no real suspense, TOTALLY unrealistic and over the top.Awful, just awful, beyond awful."
" Waste of time
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,2,Such a weak story line . Could have been good . How would killer have known about prank call . He wasn't home .
" Contender for The Worst.
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,1,"You can imagine the whole thing from the opening if you know anything about formula. If you stay to wait for the twist, like I did, you will become sad about humanity.Spoiler: it really is *that* dumb."
" Good story.... poorly done and bad acting
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,5,"I liked the idea of the story - pranksters get pranked as revenge for their antics but it just turned into another unrealistic slasher. Gregg Sulkin is the worst actor in the movie ....considering he is the main protagonist !!! Garrett Clayton was not much better and the acting is very forced and wooden. Not particularly scary or gory , or maybe it was but the bad acting just over shadowed it. In all , not a terrible movie, but forgettable."
" Unbelievable premise with far fetched technology
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,2,"So far fetched. In reality, kids pranking someone where deaths occurred and posting it online- it would have been all over the news and the cops and/or FBI would have taken them down within days. The killer wouldn't have to get revenge because those kids would have been prosecuted, not confused as to why this guy was seeking revenge. Also, the killer must be a genius to have the most amazing high tech gadgets no one has ever seen. Just ridiculous hahaha. The directing was interesting, even if it looked like he just graduated film school and was doing all the classic shots from previous award winning films- kudos for the great copy cat work."
" Don't understand the hate for this movie.
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,8,"I've never written a review before but for this one to get so much hate, I had to say something. The acting wasn't great but it wasn't terrible it was good enough from the main characters. Great story and great ending."
" Not Great
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,4,"I really really really wanted to like this movie! Great concept, great suspense, even a decent script. However, terrible execution. I still did enjoy it, just was hoping for more."
" Pranksters BEWARE.
",2018-04-24 00:00:00,10,This movie has a great plot! Incredible ending! It makes you not sympathetic for the main characters cause the pranks they pulled are extremely below the belt. It's a classic prank gone wrong scenario with unimaginable consequences.
" Don't Even Answer..
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,2,"Well, luckily, I'm safe. I barely even answer a call when it's from anyone I know.Not intentionally, mind you. 99.1% of the time the sound is off on my phone and I haven't had a landline since 9/11. I digress. What was I here for? Oh, yeah, this crappy movie. Probably the 100th ""Don't..."" horror movie and it definitely rings true here.Pretty boys, make that adults playing teens (both leads were in their later 20s and it shows) are stalked by some guy who's playing God with their electronic devices one rainy night. Why is this grown man stalking these ""Teen Beat Bait?"" Not for the reasons I just put into your mind.These two are half of four disgusting ""kids"" who prank call people in horrific ways to get YouTube hits. Naturally. And now, the joke's on them!That sounded more dramatic and original in my mind before I typed it. My apologizes. It's just as bad and unoriginal as this dull movie.Immediately into this movie, any sensible human would hate these guys. Literally hate these guys and are happy this is a horror movie so they'll get the karma coming to them. Annnd, those are just two of the many flaws here. It's so incredibly predictable and you never like any of the characters. Of course, they try to make one sympathetic, but he's just as bad or worse since he knows better. He's just a follower of his bad-news friends and says no to the bad ideas like a teen would say no to a social media post.Everything's foreseen, the acting was laughable at best, the ""villain"" was so bland - such an opportunity to get a great voiceover and the ending tries to surprise you and might just do that...to the four people left that's never seen a movie before this one. The one nice thing I can say is: it wasn't badly shot. They were definitely competent in that one single category.The rest you can skip. There are hundreds of more ""home-invasion,"" ""stalker"" films out there that are 100x better than this trash.***Final thoughts: Please stop casting people close to 30 as your teens. It cannot be pulled off unless you CGI the hell out of them and if you plan that, just make the first Pixar Horror.On second thought, I second that idea. THAT would be awesome!"
" Worth watching
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,8,"The movie is very well made and well acted. If you enjoy ""teen scream"" movies, you don't want to miss this one. I started watching out of curiosity and stayed riveted thru the whole film. Fans of ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" will want this in their queues!"
" Poor Casting - Great Story
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,6,"What I liked about this movie was the twist on the old skool teen slasher theme - a cross between Scream and IKWYDLSSome of the plot lines are far fetched, but it is a movie, so half the enjoyment is parking reality to be entertained...But for me the real let down was Colin Jones casting Garrett as a tough tattoo'd ""soon to be"" marine, which is like casting Jack from Will & Grace as the next Jason Bourne - just not believable!! Don't get me wrong, Garrett is very easy on the eye, a rising star, great in Teen Beach.... but in a horror / slasher movie?? All that pouting and peacock strutting... and getting caught in bed with Peyton? ""really""Great twist at the end - had me fooled as I was sure I knew who the killer was...Would have been an 8/10 but couldn't get past the wrong actor getting Brady...."
" Great Directing but a mish mash of other ideas
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,4,"Don't Hang Up: Directed by Damien Mace and Alexis Wajsbot and written by Joe JohnsonDon't Hang Up is a horror film where internet phone pranksters meet someone who turns the tables on them. This is a strange premise for the age we currently live in. It feels a lot like a dumb movie made out of time called Chain Letter. This teenager is making his prank phone calls via a landline. It's been a very long time since I've seen one of these in action outside of a business. It's why what little radio shows remain do prank calls to businesses. That was a little jarring to see but I was able to look past it. I have to say the directing is actually really well done. It tries for a David Fincher Panic Room vibe to a lot of the camera glides. It mixes Panic Room, Scream and Saw. It's an excellently done tension filled movie in that regard. It is super formuliac. The story is not going to be filled with surprises. It tries its best to put twists and turns in the story but you can see it coming. The characters are obnoxious d-bags in the very beginning much like Hostel. I'm starting to sense a pattern where even though this is a well made movie, it is still this mish mash of other films and better films. The actors eventually redeem these terrible characters as the real ramifications of their decisions dawn on them facing down this monster with a grudge. This villain though seems supernatural in what he is able to accomplish on his own. It can become difficult to comprehend how he is able to do this. You think he patches himself into things but it goes above and beyond that and it can get pretty hokey in the grand scheme of things. It tries. It's not enough. But it does try and I have to give the filmmakers some credit for that. I look forward to what they do for their next film. They just need better writing to go along with their directing skill. I give this film a C."
" Not worth the time.
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,2,"This movie was boring, bland, and left a bad taste in my mouth. The entire first 20 minutes of the film were basically unbearable to watch, the editing reminded me of #Horror - without the self awareness. The characters are never developed- why should I care about a couple of obnoxious teenage boys? And the acting was subpar. Sulkin's accent came out in the most 'intense' scenes, while he was yelling or struggling, and that automatically took me out of every scene. The plot was nothing special, and the ending got no reaction. Just another common slasher- barely even enjoyable, nowhere near noteworthy."
" Waste of time, better learn to knit, evreything else is better
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,3,"I read reviews that linked this movie to the bad influence of social media, interesting, maybe. So I gave it a chance, and after 40 minutes I gave up. This movie is a bore, and although I didn""t see the the whole movie, sorry but half a movie of boredom says enough to me.
The acting is bad, the story is bad, it should be a thriller but there's no thrilling moment. I say AVOID!"
" Actually pretty good
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,7,"I did not have great expectations for this flick, in fact I just threw it on to have something in the background while I picked at a little work..But I was pleasantly surprised.I mean, its not Oscar material or anything, but there are enough twists in the movie to make it worthwhile."
" Not very good
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,1,"Hopefully, anyone who watches this will be put off prank-calling for life. That's about all it's good for."
" This film feels like a YouTube compilation video of bad slasher clichés.
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,4,"I can spend hours on YouTube, clicking one pointless but entertaining compilation video after another. They have compilation/montage videos of pretty much everything you can think of, and naturally many of them are edited from famous movies, like explosions, car crashes, etc. Just type in whatever random key word in the search field and add the word ""compilation""! Why am I writing this? Well, because ""Don't Hang Up"" reminds me of these videos! This whole film actually feels like a compilation of literally ALL the dreadful clichés and stereotypes that have been overused in slasher movies since the beginning of the genre! This would be awesome if it were deliberately intended as a spoof or an overlong joke, but I suspect that everyone involved in this production considers ""Don't Hang Up"" a dead-serious and adept career achievement! I dare anyone to find a movie with more clichés. It already starts with the title; - another ""Don't!"" flick! Between the mid-seventies and early eighties, ""Don't"" titles were extremely popular and we had masterpieces like ""Don't Go in the House"", ""Don't Answer the Phone"", ""Don't Open Till Christmas"", etc Then there's the plot. Juvenile phone pranks, are you kidding us? Half of the '80s slasher oeuvre revolves on films where some stupid prank goes horribly wrong and the victim or his/her relatives subsequently take bloody vengeance. ""Don't Hang Up"" recycles this ancient premise and doesn't add anything, except of course the use of inevitable social media like blogs and smartphones. Moving on to the characters then If you think that dumb and irritating teenagers only existed in the 1980s, this movie definitely proves you wrong. The pranksters here are guaranteed the most loathsome protagonists you'll ever see. From the very beginning, you'll choose the side of the unknown killer and hope that he will butcher these idiots in the most excruciatingly painful ways imaginable. In order to make the stereotypes complete, they are also miserable cowards who betray each other and sleep with each other's girlfriends. Now, I certainly don't want to sound too arrogant myself and I'll gladly admit that I still prefer watching brainless and straightforward slashers like ""Don't Hang Up"" over pretentious and wannabe art-house horror flicks. Although 200% uninspired and forgettable, this film at least isn't boring and kept me awake at 4am in the morning after a long day. With a derivative plot and zero suspense, the makers should have been focused on a higher body count and more gruesome killings, though."
" almost the whole movie is predictable but still it works to make it watchable
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,7,"Don't Hang Up, did remind me of some stuff seen in the early eighties. Could be a title of that era, but it isn't because it's all about the social media and what it could do. There are already a few flicks out about the social media about being unfriended and things go wrong, let this one be a revenge flick about doing pranks on social media and one of them gone wrong.The way it was shot was really nice, doing effects like going through keyholes and windows with the camera so on that part it was okay. And the score did add towards the creepiness of this flick but of course it isn't all that good. It did remind me a lot of Saw somehow and it all predictable. You know towards the end who is going to kill who. In fact there are so many scene's that are predictable but still you want to see the ending. Even as you seen it in other home invasion flicks. Nothing is original but a big hurray to the director and writers. They did a good job because it didn't bothered me at all. Good entertainment and the red stuff is out there. A nice flick to start off the Halloween night and it will do at many events.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2,5/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5"
" I enjoyed this one! Good horror webcam/slasher movie.
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,8,"Oh, there is another ""Don't"" horror title.. I actually think Don't Hang Up (2017) wasn't bad at all. It was fun! I found the twist sad, but I think the killer/mysterious stranger was genius with his game and rules. Some of the characters weren't really in depth, the acting was very average. It had me like what will happen to the end lol, the ending was surprisingly good though. It's not as good as Don't Breathe (2016) or The Den (2013), but it was pretty enjoyable horror/slasher movie, and I loved the story and the way what the killer all wanted. I'm glad I enjoyed this one.My rating: 8.5/10"
" Great Movie
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,8,"Though this wasn't a perfect film, it was well orchestrated. The build-up is great, the story - intriguing and so are the characters. The acting by a few seemed sketchy but nonetheless, they delivered. By far one of the top thrillers to actually have a well-grounded story line and thought-out ending. Definitely, would recommend this."
" Not much to say
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,2,"this film had even more clichés than theater-blood. Basically a quick summary would be ""Cliché-galore"". Everything was predictable if you have just seen a few horror films. And ye, it says its a homage to old slasher film, but it does nothing to live up to these. And that would be okay if they made something new or different. I guess that's were the whole ""prank-channel""-plot comes in, in a desperate try to make an old genre relatable to current times (even though it isn't really needed), but they end up spending all the time on the phone anyways. It just ends up as a bad try to remake scream, without the meta-awareness that a film like scream, already back then, had incorporated in the plot. I usually don't mind common simple horror-films with a bit of spooks, but this was down right boring."
" If your looking for thrilling mystery this is one to watch.
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,8,"Don't hang up is a brilliant Thriller mystery that is just amazing, don't let the ratings persuade you , this movie is a must see , the story line is great, the acting is OK, sometimes the characters get annoying,but all else it epic , theirs great suspense and twists and the killers voice is amazing ."
" Basic, but fun
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,7,"PROS: This movie really captured the thriller aspect of the film. It was tense and dark and kept you on the edge of your seat. The mood set in the film described very well what the film would be about. The overarching tone was very dark and bone chilling. This sort of vibe led to a great build up in tension as the movie progressed. At the peak of the movie was when the acting was undeniably good, other than that the acting was shaky. To continue, the acting didn't take away from how smoothly the movie progressed. When you got to the resolution of the movie you were completely absorbed. Overall, DON'T HANG UP had great tension and a well executed finale CONS: The biggest and most overt problem was the inconsistencies in the plot. There were way to many loose ends and things that didn't add up. This takes away from the film because you end up spending a lot of time trying to put together the pieces of the movie, and they just wont fit. It felt seamless, but there were actually way to many hidden issues. During, but most importantly after, you really tried to comprehend how certain events took place, when you clearly couldn't. The final problem was the acting. These actors clearly weren't meant to be horror actors. Actors like GREGG SULKIN did an OK job, but most of the other actors in the movie weren't meant for this genre.www.chorror.com"
" Brady looks like Zac Efron
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,7,"Lol it was hard to concentrate on more than half of the movie because the character Brady looked too much like Zac Efron. The last like 30 minutes of the film was okay cause he was covered in blood and whatnot, so it didn't bother me as much. This is a dumb review, I know. But doesn't anyone else agree? Haha7/10: Got me on edge every once in a while. Gooooood thing they didn't use typical teen antics throughout the whole movie. Phew!"
" Only a hater will dislike

Only reason I made one is to put a review on this amazing movie. This by far is one of the most interesting and thrilling movies I've seen. I don't understand why many people put 10's on 20's about ""oh so predictable, oh I seen it coming"" like shut up. Admit that it wasn't even boring. Because I personally was on the edge of my seat through it all and yes I did see some predictable things but it overall had really good acting. I love the main character, he's always been a good actor to me. The creator of this put in some thought and I enjoyed it. Some silly kids took a prank way too for and suffered the consequences in a twisted and cruel way. Please watch and just eat some damn popcorn and enjoy."
" Deny, Deny, Deny
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,6,"Sam (Gregg Sulkin) and Brady (Garrett Clayton) are close friends, ""Brothers for Life"". They operate a web site called ""Prank Monkey 69"" where they make serious prank phone calls. One night while home alone, they make their prank calls, but then one of the people they call knows them and things get serious as this turns into a semi-home invasion type of film with a stranger calling the shots...or else.The serious prank phone calls famously died down in 2012 when an individual took their own life over one. If you watch these types of films you have a pretty good idea of the ""why"" behind it. After all there can only be one reason Scooby-Doo. The film had some decent scenes, but was over-all uneven. This is certainly not the worst in the genre, at least they didn't use a voice distorter. Considering the many bad horror films that have come out lately, you could do worse.Guide: F-word. Brief sex.

" Just Desserts
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,6,"Some friends do sick pranks on people like pretending to be the police on the phone, telling them their spouse died and then post their reactions to their sites. Not having any remorse, they continue pranking until a mysterious man calls them, turning the tide. Just desserts are served as he ups the ante by knowing everything about them. Having their parents tied to a chair, waiting to be killed, persuades them a bit. He continues to make their lives hell as they struggle to keep from hanging up the phone.This one starts off with some cool camera shots and then the film just grabs you and doesn't let up much at all. If there was a tension meter this film would have it maxed out.There are some predictable scenes and a minimal amount of violence but overall it still rocks. A decent budget and loads of jump scares keep you on your toes. Watch this one for sure and whatever you do Don't Hang Up! 6 pizza pranks out of 10."
" Uninspired
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,2,"This is a typical ho-hum revenge slasher thriller movie. The opening scene sets it up as something that seems like it might be an interesting movie but as soon as they cut to the frat boys on the other end of the phone line the story immediately becomes stupid and the acting is ridiculously bad. A lot of the smaller characters in this do a fine job it is just the leads who are just really awful. I don't understand the casting in this movie. They look the part and it is a relief for once to not see 40 year old men playing high school kids but they just don't seem believable with their dialogue and the way they act. When they laugh at their jokes it seems fake. When they get mad at their prank caller they don't seem real either. They don't seem real when they are worried, or missing their girlfriend, or anything. Just bad acting.The script is also very bad. It's a collection of jump scares and plot ""twists"" that have been done a billion times before, and better, so nothing is original or scary or even that interesting. Every single scene you can guess what is going to happen before it actually does. It's also pretty obvious as soon as these prank callers start getting called back who is probably doing it and why. The flashback scene is really awful too.The other actors are OK, the soundtrack is good, the CGI is better than in most movies in the low budget range. But the awful script and lead characters/actors means this movie is hopeless. At least it is mercifully short at only like 70 minutes plus credits."
" Scared me, but not the best ending
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,7,"Ignore the aggressive reviews with low ratings, this film was a decent film. A good mix of ""saw"" and ""the strangers"". You have no empathy for the killer nor the protagonists throughout the movie, yet you want someone to get killed. The unnerving and creepy feeling of the film kept me watching, although the ending could have been better.. I do recommend this to anyone who likes a creepy slasher. I've seen MANY bad horror films and this is not close to one."
" Really satisfying
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,10,"Sure, it can get predictable, but the main characters got exactly what they deserved. I mostly care about getting scared and seeing blood everywhere so I can't say if the story is amazing. Same with acting. I just loved seeing exactly what I wanted to see. These characters are perfect for this kind of movie. They're obnoxious and inconsiderate. You want to see them fail. Seeing their faces the moment they realized they messed up was pure bliss for me."
" So many plot holes that make this movie unbelievable
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,2,"I started watching this movie and was somewhat interested as the movie went on, a typical revenge killer movie. I found hints of ""The Strangers"" in it. Taking away the safety of being in your own home, but they decide to ruin the movie within the last 20 minutes. They just created so many holes that made the movie unbelievable. 1) they boys did not cover up their friend at the back door with anything, yet when Bruce or what ever his name was went back there, the body was covered and he does not question that. Not to mention the height difference. 2) when Sam was in the back yard with his girlfriend, the ""killer"" which soon after you find out is Bruce with his mouth taped up and what I would assume the knife taped or zip tied to his hand tries to attack Sam.... why? Why not just stand their making noises with your mouth and attempt to take the mask off with the knife, but instead act like the killer (who manages to take 4-5 baseball swings without going down) Sam also doesn't notice after the first few swings that the knife is unwillingly in his hands.... 3) we learn that the first scene where the boys are pranking the blonde women ends up having the women kill her own daughter and herself. If an intruder is in your home, why is your instinct to shoot at no higher then crotch height and through a door. Seriously? Do you think an intruder is 3 feet tall... also if the cops weren't going to shoot the intruders because they have your child, then why would you, someone who is untrained with a gun, think it would be a good idea. The whole ending just baffles me, to the point where I made an account to write this review. Poor performance"
" I thought it was great
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,8,"Idk why people on here are bashing this movie. It is an amazing movie that had some creepy ass scenes. It didn't just rely on jump scares Though there is like 2, but had actual hair stand up on the back of your neck scenes. I do agree that the characters weren't really in depth but then again this is a horror/slasher movie. It's hard to give characters such significant depth before they are axed off that it is to be expected to not have the greatest moments. Take You're Next. like 1/10 characters in that show had depth yet people rave how great it is. Alos I just wanted to point out something since this movie is getting bashed for the technology you see and I feel like I need to set things straight. yes, the technology exists today that you see in this movie. My auntie can turn on her TV, turn off her lights, and even lock and unlock her doors with her phone. So people going ""omfg it pisses me off how unrealistic this movie is"" just haven't caught up to the times. It's a creepy movie, characters died gory deaths, there was a few scares, I was happy with it."
" Incredibly predictable..
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,1,"I usually avoid saying in all reviews that the movie was ""predictable"" and you'll see ""the twists coming from far away"" because it just makes you sound pretentious.But wow, you really DO see the twists coming from far away and the movie IS incredibly predictable. And no, it isn't ""clever"" like some reviewer said.The bigger problem isn't even that it fails to get to you or shock you, if you're a regular horror movie viewer, with laughably bad jump ""scares"" (my old review for movie Last Shift, ""LOUD NOISES AREN'T SCARY"", now say that out loud directors). The problem is that you don't empathize with ANY of the ""main"" characters in this movie, at all.Not a single likable character, from protagonists to girlfriend to the guy who apparently was the one uploading the prank video but is like a side character (wtf is with that?). In-fact, the only one you'll empathize with is the killer and maybe it's intentional, maybe you are supposed to cheer for him. But then why spend time trying to make main characters likable? Obviously the directors were confused with whom the audience should side with here.Then there is the predictable turns, calls and twists. Which became REALLY ridiculous near the end when I actually started giggling like a git, predicting what'll happen next. It was THAT obvious. Oh and the killer is not scary, the voice actor for the killer has a generic whiny voice which does not instill fear in you or awes you in any way whatsoever. Killer looks like a toned down version of Michael Myers with smaller cheaper mask.Do yourself a favor and instead of this, go watch Phone Booth (2002) and Cellular (2004). Both of those movies did what ""Don't Hang Up"" is trying to rip-off. And they did it WAY better, ages ago while actually being more believable with use of phones than Don't Hang Up (oh derp, killer magically hacks phones to redirect all calls to.. himself? I guess he's a top App developer as well in his spare time?)."
" Not too shabby!
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,6,"I did have low expectations going in after seeing the trailer thinking to myself ""how many more times can they do this type of film?"" However, it wasn't as bad as I expected. The plot twist at the end was refreshing, but I had trouble with the two main leads - I don't feel they were cast properly and belonged instead in some low budget comedy, not a thriller of this caliber. They were very unconvincing. Even the rest of the cast were nothing special. What was the most impressive was the directing, editing and cinematography - the latter of which I felt was too good for this type of film (i.e. camera zooms from keyhole). The pace was slow, but otherwise this film was not too shabby. It's a 6/10 form me"
" Meh - You've seen it a million times
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,5,"Nothing really new here. This movie rehashes known formulas. There were maybe one or two decent jump scares, but the rest is pretty mundane. It will pass the time and to its credit, the film isn't too long that it overstates its welcome.However, as I said, there is absolutely nothing original about it. Any attempts at ""twists"" will fall flat instantly as you can see them a mile away.It will also, sadly, completely fall apart as soon as you spend 5 minutes thinking about it.**** SPOILERS BELOW! ****Leaving aside how the guy managed to do everything he did, or that the kids are so stupid (Did Sam really get out of the house and hasn't bothered trying to get into any other house to call the police? He had a bat in his hand for crying out loud just smash a window)But what's absolutely worse is that the story makes no sense. We are to believe that these kids made a prank on a women to scare her and posted a video of it online. She was so terrified, that she accidentally shot her own kid - and yet the kids never heard about it? Seriously?!?"

Why keep making the same thing?Acting could have been better. But the obvious major problem here is the plot, it's been done so many times. However, it did manage to scare me at times, I wouldn't say it's a bad film, but the ''twists'' had my eyes rolling. Watch it if you want."

",2017-06-17 00:00:00,7,I can easy see how this movie can offense many people cause nowadays with the booming of technology it very easy to prank call other people and get away with it so left alone the movie just the concept of this movie already make me feel sick.Right from the start the movie did a good job on making us the audience hate the two main character to the guts so when karma bites back to them you just can't help rotting for the villain cause his motivation is clear and heartfelt.The movie is fast faced just about 1h 23min but it packed enough suspense and thrilling to satisfied any horror lover.It does sometime get a little silly when you see some character make very dumb choice and annoying as hell with their wooden acting but for a first time director this is as good as it gets
" A Pleasant Surprise That Mixes 'Saw' and 'When a Stranger Calls'!!!
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,8,"I love buying up horror movies, and I happened to stumble upon this at Walmart. I read the back, and it sounded intriguing. I watched it and was surprised at just how good it was. Very suspenseful and makes you wonder what the caller is gonna do next. A couple of guys named Sam and Brady make Youtube videos of themselves prank-calling people with pretty dark material. On a dark and rainy night of pizza, movies, and prank calls, Sam and Brady receive a call of their own. The voice says to call him Mr. Lee and ""don't hang up"" or something terrible will happen. Sam and Brady try to call 911, but the caller has hacked their phones. If they try to leave the house, the caller will hurt someone they love. Who is this mysterious caller and why has he targeted Sam and Brady? I highly recommend that you DON'T HANG UP!!!"
" honestly...
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,6,"id recommend this movie for the ending, some what predictable, and somewhat not, ultimately rewarding. i mean, its touching on something millennials are literally making profitable lifestyles out of... who hasn't binge watched prank videos on youtube for hours before. this movie depicts a watch worthy result of one gone too far."
" its very entertaining
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,9,its a good story these teens prank call which can lead to bad results so they kind of have themselves to blame but this guy did go to far but he had his reasons very good i loved it should give it a go no way you cant like it also very good acting by all of them but this film is a example of people doing bad things and paying the price so make you sure you don't copy these guys!!!!
" awesome movie reminds me of scream
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,10,This movie is awesome I like it a lot. It reminds me of the scream movies but now is only guys which is cool is quite different and the movie experience was just amazing! They really should make movies like this more often no damn weak girls dying I really hope they make another one.
" Great Story But Film Was Too Long
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,6,"I loved the story. The reason the killer was after them was ingenious, and I loved how he set them up. I believe in an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, therefore I felt the killer was right in what he did. I don't think he should have killed the girlfriend because she was innocent but the rest of the pranksters deserved it for what they did. I just found that the movie was too long and too drawn out. The film could have been and hour long and it would have been perfect."
" YAY death
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,4,"When you start watching, you really want the original characters to get their dues. They are assholes who terrorize the community. When they start to get whats coming to them, you get a little bit of feeling for them but not enough. To be honest. You feel more for the ""baddie"" than the protagonists in this film. No real story or pay off. Zero twists."
" Watchable
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,2,"I think the main problem with this move is that, if you've seen at least 10 different thrillers or horror movies ever in your life, you're going to know exactly what is going to happen. And that really ruins the movie for the viewer in first 10 minutes or less. The acting is okayish, not the worst tho; movie itself is completely predictable and kind of slow paced, nothing was really going on for most of the movie and I was just sitting there waiting for it to end. Maybe I've seen to many movies, but I do not see how this could keep anyone ""on the edge"" throughout the movie. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone; unless they're deadly scared of horror movies but still want to watch one; although I would rather classify this as a bad thriller than a horror. There are millions of better movies to watch, if you're looking to waste 1hr and 23mins of your life, there's many more useless stuff to do than watch this."
" Predicable, predictable, predictable.
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,3,"Figured this out (for a large part) within about 15-10 minutes of the start of the movie. But even if I hadn't, this film still wouldn't have been enjoyable. None of the characters are sympathetic - including the only female of the cast - and you really don't care what happens to them, you just kind of watch them as the transparent story unfolds. The male characters are stereotypical unlikable asses, the mopey protagonist is cookie-cutter material for a thriller movie, and how the villain manipulates technology is never remotely discussed. The climax is anti-climatic and the only positive thing I can say about the experience of watching (and wasting two hours on) this movie is that I'm glad I didn't pay for it (freebie rental!)"
" Not that bad,matter of fact good
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,9,Really good movie sometimes predictable but most movies are.Idea not that original but it keeps you to the screen.I would say watch the movie there are definitely better movies but this is a good movie to watch if you have extra time.Also idk why are people hating on it so much.
" Terrible; Not even worth a rental
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,4,"WARNING: SPOILERS IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPHFortunately, I got this movie via a free red box rental code, and didn't have to pay a dime. By now, you know the plot, so I won't rehash that. I will say that the film does have a few decent things going for it: primarily, it is pretty suspenseful during certain scenes, and it does have a couple minor twists to the story. And surprisingly, the acting is not bad at all, which is somewhat surprising for a B-level horror movie.Aside from that, my main issue with this film is the TERRIBLE ending. We don't even get to see the killer's face. But on top of that, the final ""twist"" (if that's what you want to call it), is TERRIBLE. Aside from not seeing the killer's face, the film ends with Sam being framed for the killings by the killer. Yeah...very original, and it felt like it was placed in the movie solely for the purpose of one final ""twist"".If your curiosity is still piqued, I strongly recommend watching this via a cheap rental. It's not worth much more."
" Not a bad flick...
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,7,"20 Reviews. This movie has 20 reviews and most of them are negative. Not understanding the hate fest that's going on right now, but trust me, if you've seen as many BAD movies that I've seen...this would be an Oscar contender. All and all, this held my interest and has some intense and scary moments. Love the twists and even as the movie began I knew all these pranks these punks had done would eventually backfire on them. They made the wrong guy mad...and what happened to this poor man...these pranksters deserved every single bit of what they got. Not going to spoil it for you. Nope. Not how I roll. I will say I enjoyed this movie, but it's a one time watcher. The kind of movie you'd recommend to your friends to watch. Watch it folks. Give it a chance."
" no good
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,1,"When I first read the storyline, I was looking forward to watch it BUT from the very first scenes I noticed absolute lack of atmosphere,anyway I was waiting for something original to happen but no luck. The acting was bad, the dialogues so unnatural and it was really hard to find something original. It was impossible to feel empathy for anyone or tension, it was waste of time"
" Artistically disgusted
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,3,"Welp! So much for the nice cover! Anyways, this movie was basically a formulaic redo of every other slasher/killer-arrives-at-my-house type of movie that includes a choice-making game or w/e.The first and the last 5 minutes were nice and the rest of the movie was B O R I N G - here's why:1) Poorly developed characters; nothing makes u want to root for them and u're just like ""um, am i supposed to feel sad here""; 2) Clichés every 30 seconds; 3) Poor background and ambiance sounds, most of the time they were sooooo out of place and odd; 4) Too many impossible to explain things, for example, how on earth does the antagonist, which we know nothing about till the end of the movie, so much knowledge on technology? And how dafuq is it possible to manipulate the landline, the GSM coverage, and the main character's house technology and electricity only thru the laptop we get to see in the bad guy's truck??? 5) Literally no suspense, everything was sooooo predictable - no plot twists, no surprises, u literally could see everything coming.Welp, I could keep going, but u probs get the idea. Anyway, what I did like about the movie a lot was the camera work. It was absolutely incredible, like damn boi! Congratz on that, but how good is a movie that the only nice thing about is the camera work - a hint - it's not."
" A very short review of ""Don't Hang Up"" (2017)
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,7,"""Don't Hang Up"" (2017) is an absolutely derivative horror movie that nevertheless manages to be halfway decent. I'd rate it a 7 out of 10.We follow a handful of older teenage boys whose favorite avocation is perpetrating cruel prank phone calls and then posting them on the Internet. The horror genre's penchant for vengeance should make their comeuppance predictable. ""Don't Hang Up"" seems to borrow in equal (large) measure from the ""Saw"" and ""Scream"" film franchises, with touches of ""Unfriended"" (2014) and even ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991).Still, this was a halfway serviceable scary movie. There were nice moments of tension, and it held my interest.This doesn't belong on anyone's must-see list, but it's a fun enough time-waster if you can't find a better movie."
" Bit of a let down to be honest
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,2,"I knew as soon as I read what this film was about that it would be quite awfully executed. I was correct in my assessment of this. An awful story line with moderate at best acting coupled together to make this monstrosity.I think it would have been better if things were explained a little more. How did the killer manage to track these kids for a year and know everything about them, was he a spy? Also to kill that kids parents and also their friends was a little harsh, I mean they didn't actually kill anyone themselves.Ending was predictable and was upset that everyone didn't die in a horrific manner.2/10 would not recommend to a friend."
" No original ideas at all
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,3,"This movie has just picked up bits from dozens of previous movies and copied and paste into one. Obviously the killer making a phone call has been done a million times before and nothing wrong with doing again if you can add something different to it.But here you have the 'hang up and you \ someone you love dies' like in Scream, 'dead body rising from the floor like in Saw, killer stood in the background while victim looks scared like The Strangers, Good guy kills who he think is the bad guy only for it to be revealed it's not like in kill list..This list goes on as this movie is full of clichés and copying of other films scenes. Everything seems forced to accommodate the copied scenes, like the 'dead body' rising, why? completely unnecessary. I'm not saying movie can't copy from others and every idea should be original, but this one takes it too far, and the end where he screams into sky in the rain as the camera zooms out is just laughable."
" Sometimes you just want an old fashioned slasher
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Just got done watching it. Really liked it, nothing new but well done on old ideas. Kind of a cross between ""I know what you did last summer"" and ""saw"" with maybe a little ""are you in the house alone"" mixed in. High tension throughout, kept me interested and played out well. Lots of horror tropes that we all know and love (well some of us anyway) Looking at IMDb reviews and a lot of people didn't like it. But they're the same people who only like the artsier horror like Babadook or The Witch. Both good movies but sometimes you just want a good old fashioned slasher, something that doesn't make you think or try and figure it out. This is that movie.Good production value, good use of lighting, sound etc. Acting was decent and even though the ideas were old I thought the way they were brought about was good. I give it an 8 of 10, good use of an hour and a half on a boring night."
" Never mind 'don't hang up', just don't bother answering.
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,2,"I couldn't watch this all the way through, it was really that bad.I gave up around the hour mark as i just couldn't bear any more of the terrible acting, awful script and brutal plot... I'll bet however that at some point in the last 10 - 15 minutes the dead friend at the back door will used as a 'clever' distraction where our Killer takes his place, fooling one or both of these complete idiots. If this happens then it wouldn't surprise me if the 'clever' Killer also uses another fine Horror trope and fools one of our inept heroes into believing their friend is in fact the Killer at which point our inept hero will kill his friend... It seems that kind of film that wants to borrow almost to the point of plagiarising other films plots and ideas to then claim them as their own fresh innovation.There were instances from the start that had me scratching my head in utter disbelief... They 'prank call' people, causing massive upset along the way while all the time filming themselves doing so, then they upload these videos to a 'Youtube' clone and no one, and i mean no one they then prank even gets slightly suspicious at a strange number calling and concocting the most fantastical tales winding them up all the way to divorcing their wife or being convinced their child is dead or God knows what else. No one even seems to want to challenge them or close their channel down or inform the authorities or in fact perhaps even watch their videos it would seem...That is until they themselves then receive a call from someone who begins winding them up.Now of course these two super confident young pranksters are too cool for school yet within minutes of the stranger phoning them they're sweating, panicking, heavy breathing to the point of hyperventilating..their lives have collapsed round about them, all within the space of a few minutes. then they start fighting each other, hiding things from each other..all the rest of it AND this is all done in a way that is presumed to be clever film making... No, it isn't. It's all sign posted, illuminated like Blackpool Tower, flashing Neon signs pointing the way.. One will die the other will be framed for the murders... Am i right?? I bet i am.The thing is it all started so promisingly. the opening scene was excellent, the young Mother receiving the call - 'stay where you are, there's intruders in the house...this is the Police, we're monitoring them'....etc...etc. It was building an air of menace, that was quite clever film making and then it all went South, like dropping a hammer off a 10 storey building..BOOM! film over at that point. They started strongly with what could have been a fantastic concept for that initial minute or two and then the rest of what i could bear was more idiots doing idiotic things in an idiotic manner.Oh, one more thing and if i'm right here, someone has to buy me an Ice cream... The Killer will be related to the Woman in the opening scene, who probably accidentally killed her Child after being wound up by these idiot lads... Also if i am right, it will only prove just how predictable this whole mess of a film actually is."
" Now was that really necessary?
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,4,"This film is about a gang of teenage prank caller friends, who one day dial the wrong number. Now you don't even need to reach the 30 minute mark on the movie to know this is going to chastise prank callers. In fact, you just need to watch the opening scene to know that these particular prank callers are not only stupid but very very unfunny. Since when has home invasion been a riot, guys?That said, there are some interesting if small twists to the story and the camera work and editing are decent. That's about all the good points I can think of. Meanwhile there's a bunch of problems, including but not limited to overacting, detracting, bad writing, confusion and a whole lot of pointless darkness. It appears as if the movie is trying to be SAW, but WITHOUT the actual death scenes. WUT.Bed time story for an unfunny and irresponsible prank caller. Is this the modern equivalent of the big bad wolf now?"
" The good reviews
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,1,are all straight up pranks. I just want to shake anyone and throttle them until they come to their senses to claim this utter garbage is worth watching. Literally anything on CW is more entertaining to watch. Terrible twist that anyone could figure out. Direction is boring. CGI and use of social media is artificial. Actors are God awful. So much to dislike. The only reason I sat and watched the whole dreadful affair is because I am zapped of any energy due to the flu. I am easily amused and entertained when I super sick. So that's how I know how bad this movie is. Shame on anyone writing that this movie is clever and interesting. This is the kind of movie that is so bad that I am angry after watching it.
" I loved it!
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,7,"Not the best horror movie ever but I was very pleasantly surprised. In fact, I thought it was a refreshing change from all the remakes that have butchered many horror movie classics. The prank calling story line has certainly been overused but at least it wasn't about babysitters being told the calls were coming from inside the house. I thought this one had a different spin to it and I can't say I have seen too many movies lately that have kept my attention for 123 consecutive minutes. I thought it had plenty of suspense wondering what would happen next and who the bad guy was so those 123 minutes never had a dull moment for me. Other than the fact that you know someone is going to die, I did not find it predictable and certainly never saw that ending coming whatsoever. It was a nice twist that fit right in with the story and I wasn't left sitting there wondering ""what happened?"" or saying ""I don't get it."" Still trying to figure out the end of Nocturnal Animals. Movie doesn't have lot of gore if you are into that and I don't think you will feel like you just lost 123 minutes of your life that you will never get back. Give it a chance. It is good. Acting was just as good as most you see and maybe better. I rank this up there with The Strangers which was kind of slow in the beginning but when it came to life, it was great. I would watch this movie again."
" A double helping of ""clever"" .. but massively short on Empathy
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"If you are a film student you know that the ""reversal"" usually comes in the final act, and there is a reason for that. By that point, the viewer is fully engaged, the endorphins are pumping, the action is flowing, and there is a need to take things up a notch.What is happening here -- and let's give credit where credit is due -- is that the reversal takes place off the top, two pranksters get the tables turned, and it all happens in the first 10 minutes.That is clever and it is a great start. But it creates problems. If you bring the reversal in too early, you run the risk of becoming dependent on it to drive the film, instead of relying on the basics. Such as dialog, characterizations, empathy, viewer connection.Which is what happens here. After a great start there are major chunks that just lag, and the reason is that -- to be blunt -- by the halfway point, if you are a typical viewer, you don't really care if the 'slasher' gets the kids or the kids get the slasher. NO EMPATHY.Many of the subsequent ""slasher tropes"" that close the third act are just that -- borrowed tricks from dozens of films you have already seen.Overall the film is technically perfect and at some point in the not-too-distant future, those involved in it will look back at DON'T HANG UP as a great start for their Highlight Reel, but not entirely representative of their best work."
" It's Good, But...
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,5,"I read the plot first before watch the whole movie. Then, I get interested and then I watched the whole movie. First 15 minutes was okay for me for the story, two boys prank a lot of people with terrible jokes. By the time the antagonist play the role, I intentionally started to feel like ""it is a bit exaggerated"". It doesn't make sense that the protagonist knows every corner, every single thing the two boys did. It could make a sense if this film tells us the story behind it how the antagonist set all the cameras, how he get into those two boys' life, house, and makes an acceptable rapprochement. The good thing is the ending is not disappointed and makes sense yet I'm not that satisfied with the sense of its technology in this movie (it's like the murderer is a god. Knows everything)."
" A very high quality horror/thriller
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed 'Don't Hang Up'. It's a bit of a cross between 'Scream' and 'Phone Booth' - both films that I love. It's a return to the days of smart thrillers, where not everything is as it seems and you have to keep thinking right up until the dying moments. In fact that's the thing I liked most about it, is that it treats the viewer with respect. Too many films today insult the audience with bland and uncreative scripts that they think they can cover up with special effects and a great number of jump scares. Not 'Don't Hang Up' though. It has both a wonderful script to work with and is wonderfully shot.I'd call this more of a thriller than a horror, but there are certainly elements to it that would have to classified as horror. There are minimal (if any at all?) jump scares. Instead, they take the high road and simply do a tremendous job of creating tension in every scene. The acting from a young cast is also superb, and the voice work of Philip Desmeules is nothing short of brilliant. I can honestly say I wasn't far off giving this one a '10'. It's a brilliant film that needs to be seen."
" A Brilliant Movie
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,10,"Starting with direction and camera movement this movie is definitely one of the best. I like the fact that the environment they choose and the way everything implemented was very goo. Its kind of like collector meet scream with a little twist and turns, You can also add a elements of one missed call. ending was great and I am still hopping they can bring the second part as I want to know what will happened next and the best thing about this movie is that you will wait for what happened specially its a prank call so till the end you don't know really if its real or not or is is staged or something else. All I can say that you must watch these movie. Its not for typical horror or gore lovers but for real people looking for some cool direction, acting and teen movie. Must watch guys! a brilliant ride."
" Really worth a watch.
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"My first review, oh dear....;) So going into this movie I figured it might be to my liking, considering my tastes, but I was weary about the quality. I am happy to report that I needed have worried.The movie was shot well(none of that shaky cam crap for example) and looked professional. Don't ask me about the budget I have no idea, don't care and believe that is all a load of BS anyway, you don't need hundreds of millions $$ to make a good movie.As for the plot, yeah... there where a few bits that most people will probably see coming a mile away, but the ending... it might surprise a couple of people I guess. However I felt it kept up a good pace, never slowing down too much that it gets boring nor speeding up to the point where it feels rushed. It had a good flow.The actors also did a good job and there where no moments that made me cringe; not that I really think it's the place of most people to judge the acting in a movie(what do we know? we have no experience in that field), but then again there are some movies here and there where even a 2 cell amoeba has the right to say ""That was just bad!!!"".In conclusion I give it an 8/10 and think most of you won't regret watching it. And yeah, I'd watch ""Don't Hang Up 2"" if they came up with it.Hope this helped, wish you a fun movie night."
" boring
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,3,"It is a kind of revenge slasher - from what i think ... similar to maybe ""Saw"". The bad guys are being punished. The problem with this kind of setup is that it is hard to feel bad for them. Granted, the collateral damage to innocents around them - and the severity of the punishment is arguably too much - but they are still a far cry from likable enough to care for them.The reason for the revenge punishment is sooooo old, so predictable, so boooring. In my opinion - it might have been better if the guy stated that he was just a sadistic a**h**e, instead of the soppy origin flashback.So in short - the story is very, VERY old, uninmaginative and HIGHLY predictable. In fact - i felt like i was able to predict a majority of scenes shortly before they happened - just based on previous movies that did it the same way.The acting was average. A little overacting from the main protagonists - and all in all ... not very subtle.Something that throws me out of any immersion - especially with movies set in our time - is when they use internet apps that are clearly meant to be a brand name, but cannot due to copyrights. So there is no google, no youtube etc. . For me... it could as well be ACME then - instead of some placeholder. (it is just a little thing, but it tend to bother me)From a cinematography point of view. The camera works are not bad - but tend to display a little unnecessary CGI long-shots through windows and stuff. It feels like showing off - but at least it is not found footage. My conclusion is a 3/10 - because the movie is not innovative, uncreative - and hence ... quite boring. There is NO suspense at all - none. And there is also no feeling of any kind of satisfaction."
" Karma IS a *itch!
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"It seems just about any horror movie I venture to watch I find myself going in already rolling my eyes. ""Don't Hang Up"" was no exception...and then I watched the movie!""Don't Hang Up"" opens with a female receiving a call at 3:23 a.m.-- supposedly from the police--advising her house is surrounded because they have seen an intruder enter. They advise her to bar herself in her room and don't hang up the phone. Turns out, it is a vicious prank played by some very mean-spirited young men, you know, just for *hits and giggles. Seems this group of miscreants has a leader who is only interested in how many uploads his videos receive. The group cares nothing about the feelings of others. Unexpectedly, while two of the guys are alone, they start their little game again of prank calls, but unfortunately, someone answers and now the tables are turned.I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. Yes, you do have to throw caution to the wind about the plot because certain incidents that take place will have you scratching your head and saying ""this could not happen."" I say ignore the ridiculous and just go with it! The acting was a step way above most movies of this genre, and I thought it very creative of the directors to take a group of guys you absolutely despise from the very start of the movie and then turn them into people you really care about. The directors also manage to build some actual tension and the guessing game of ""who is doing this"" plays to the very end.The movie is rated ""R"" for violence, disturbing images, and language. Recommended; I think you will enjoy this one."
" More Processed Garbage
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,3,"So allow me to start off by saying: Do NOT waste your time on this movie. If you consider yourself to be a fan of horror/thriller movies, do yourself a favor and go watch ""The Babadook"" or ""The Witch"". If you like movies about killers, go watch ""Seven"" or ""Silence of The Lambs"".Jesus, if you appreciate the art of film-making , go watch anything else but this. This is the nothing more than the typical Hollywood DIY Horror Movie Starter Kit for film students. Hell, I'm not even a film student and i've made better short films than this feature film. I actually dare not call it a film. It is a product. I sincerely have no clue to how this movie is sitting at a 7.6 at the time of this review. Actually, scratch that. I do know how. Audiences. In this day and age, audiences are OK with not being challenged by the films they see. Most of them just go to the movies to see the newest action movie starring Jason Statham or Tom Cruise, merely to wipe their minds of their lives for one and a half hours. The same goes for horror. I consider myself to be quite the horror enthusiast, and have seen my fair share of fantastic masterpieces of cinema, as well as pure trash. So i believe myself to be qualified enough to have an opinion on this product. So, ""what's wrong with the movie"", you ask? Well, let's start with the basics. Right from the get go, the movie's tone is all over the place, from dark and grimm to silly and goofy in a flash. This can happen in a film, but usually it takes a director who has, you know, talent. The characters are written as outright cartoonish and annoying, boring and predictable. There is no main character for the audience to get attached to, and no likable character for that matter. This could work if they tried to make the movie about the villain (sort of like ""No country for Old Men"" which still makes every character interesting, relatable, or both), but dammit if he is not one of the most bland, clichéd, unappealing, and straight up uninteresting ""characters"" i've ever seen. His motives are simple, yet he doesn't get developed or have any depth to him. Are you starting to see one of the movies main problems here? No character is likable or relatable, thus the audience doesn't care what happens to them, nor feels any empathy when something does. The audience is removed from the universe of the movie. And that is fatal in a horror movie. You want your audience as engaged as possible, not looking at their phone or wondering about how they're going to deal with that parking ticket they got the other day. Another problem is the acting. My god, the acting... It ranges from bad to horrible, and no actor is believable enough in his/her performance to sell their ""characters"". All i saw was bad actors. The plot is paper thin. There is no tension, as it is predictable enough to guess the villain's identity within 5 minutes of his appearance. But what hurts the movie the most is just it's lack of originality and identity. It's another movie that belongs in the dollar bin at your local supermarket. A movie for teens to see and go ""Oh, that looks scary!"",only to realize they've seen this movie without ever watching it. I'm giving it a 2/10. My review? Don't bother."
" Ugh! Too many implausibilities...
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,5,"Many times when watching a film (especially horrors and thrillers), one needs to just swallow certain absurd plot points. You just have to sit back and go ""well, it is a movie, so I'm not going to let common sense get in the way too much."" But there comes a time when way too many absurdities come up and you no longer can accept what you are watching. It actually becomes comical. That's what happens in this film. The villain in this flick is so savvy with technology, he is able to do things beyond what anyone (unless they work for the Government in cyber security or something) could do. But of course, these masterful tech things are necessary to keep the movie going. I guarantee you are going to ask yourself at least half a dozen times during the movie if what you are seeing is even capable of happening, how it happened, how the villain worked it out, and how everything happened in such perfect order that it worked with no problems. And by the time you ask yourself that for the sixth time, you will be rolling your eyes. I can't even comment too much about the film itself (writing, directing, acting) because the craziness of how it all goes down just goes beyond looking at any other aspect of the film. Does it sometimes have good suspense? Yes. Are the main characters good actors? Sure. Will it make horror fans happy? A portion of them, yes. But does it take way too many liberties where the audience has to suspend their disbelief? ABSOLUTELY. Too many liberties. Sadly, those issues force me to grade the film no higher than a 5."
