" Worth every second
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,9,"'Not accepting the truth is not going to change reality, the best thing you could do is accept it. Accept what you feel and what you really want. FACE YOUR FEARS.' - Telling this was the purpose of this movie and it has done it beautifully."
" Pretty good
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Now this book was one of the first books that ever made me cry and the play I watched of it was also superb so I went into this with, I'll be honest, impossibly high expectations. However, it somehow reached them. Amazing performance from the young boy playing our protagonist and a heartfelt, emotional one from felicity Jones. This film nailed every aspect of the book, and so, for the third time, A Monster Calls franchise made me cry. Well worth the watch!!"
" Amazing
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,10,The movie felt like it was made for me i looked like the young boy at that age and lost my father i went through the same emotions and spent my time in the forest. The trees where always and still are there for me.
" A Monster Calls - Movie Review
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,9,"I never realized how popular trees are in cinema. How many films do we have that involve walking, talking trees? Wizard of Oz, The Lord of the Rings, Pocahontas, now this. However, all jokes aside, this film is absolutely stunning. Everything from the CGI of the tree, the voice work from Liam Neeson, who should voice every mystical creature from here on out, wonderful acting from MacDougall, and a surprise appearance from Sigourney Weaver, who I had no idea was in this until she popped up on screen. The plot is smart, chopping it up into what feel like segments made it easy to follow and get easily engaged. The message the film is conveying is impactful, and thoughtful bringing an element of tragedy like a Shakespearean play. And for the fact that it is a child having to go through all of this makes it all the more notable and emotionally involving. The layers this film creates is what impresses me the most. Instead of going to the safe route that the majority of films would have done, J.A. Bayona (the director) gave the story such a layered, and rich direction with his heart and soul poured into the story overall. I even caught myself saying I could easily see Steven Spielberg directing this, and that is the highest compliment I could possibly give this director and this film. And I'll leave it at that. (9.7/10)"
" Masterpiece.
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,10,"I went in without knowing and spent a good 20 minutes crying. Despite the fantasy elements, this movie is VERY real. The way that the characters are acting given the situation is completely believable. I can't say anything more without going into spoiler territory but you absolutely have to watch this."
" Beautiful and inspiring
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,8,"One of the most beautiful movies ever seen. The storyline, the details, the acting and...the messages in the movie....perfect."
" Incredibly moving, and I never say that about a movie
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,10,"I'm still ugly crying as I write this, right after watching A Monster Calls. I was just looking for a movie to keep me company on Valentine's Day, and I love a good fantasy. And I pretty much just randomly selected this one. I haven't seen a movie of any genre with this much depth of emotion, at least for my personal experience. Perhaps, if you haven't experienced great grief, it won't resonate with you; but if you have, this movie provides an incredible vehicle for allowing you to let yourself feel your feelings and actually understand a lot of them in a way you might not have been able to before.The story is both simple and complicated. It draws you in. The performances are superb, from the always wonderful Sigourney Weaver to the marvelous child actor, Lewis MacDougall. Liam Neeson's tree monster is both terrifying and sympathetic. When the monster first started telling the stories, I was thinking, ""Oh, this is going to be a bit lame,"" but I was so wrong.I have never had a movie make me sob this much, yet feel so much relief and comfort from doing it. A truly healing experience."
" Probably or is the best film I've ever watched.
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,10,"This film is both heart wrenching and magical. I've never cried this much over a movie it's not for those looking for a happy go lucky movie. It's more for people maybe looking to reconnect to their emotions. This movie is profound and has so much depth that if you've ever felt grief. Unless you have no feelings,It will reach you on a personal level. Certainly did with me anyway I remember losing my nan at age 11 and seeing my dad cry for the first time. This film brought back my inner childhood. The film tells the story about a young boy, that's struggling with the fact his mom is dying of cancer. He's also getting bullied at school and hates the idea he will have to live with his nan when she is really ill. He's very angry and takes some of it out on his nan.Until he realises his nan is grieving too! because she's losing his mom/her daughter. It's very sad but I'd watch it again. Liam Neeson is powerful as the voice in his dreams. Acting of the boy is amazing that he just grabs you and rips your heart out. As usual a great performance from Sigourney Weaver as the Grandmother. I feel like crying and it's the next day. I found the film healing me,myself and my grief I have suffered. It makes you realise for some of us we've never really let go of our emotions. It makes you realise even though love is never enough it's still left behind in you and others the that person leaves behind. Great film,highly recommended."
" Heartbreaking
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,10,"When a film moves me to tears, it gets the highest rating. It's as simple as that."
" Beautiful
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,9,"A beautiful film about dealing with grief and the powerful emotions that accompany. Simple but effective, good acting and beautiful cinematography."
" Emotionally draining, How a disease can take a lot out of your family.
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,10,"I could not find a good title except for the fact that this child is trying to explain this powerful source that makes him think it is a dream but at the very end not everything doesnt is as it seems. My service dog next to me is emotionally concerned for my tears and my depression after watching this movie and rightfully so because this movie really hit home for me and my family. All I can say to you ""Your not Alone"""
" My shortest review ever.
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,9,7.5 is way too low a rating for this film.7.5 is way too low.
" Beautiful. Heartbreaking. Healing.
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,9,"I just went through a massive grief episode about a week before I watched this movie, so I was a little nervous it would make me cry and feel it all over again. And yup, it definitely made me cry, but in a healing way. The message in this movie is beautiful and healing and incredibly real for those who have gone through grief. It helped me heal while listening to the stories and message in this movie, and at the end I felt calm and relief. This movie was a physical description of everything I've felt bottled inside, and it was cathartic to see it play out so perfectly on screen. Incredible."
" Outstanding Performance from an 12 Year Old Boy
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,"If Lewis MacDougall doesn't get an Oscar or whatever the English version of it is, I vote we stage protests."
" A movie with depth
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,"A couple of years ago I have read the book and was
deeply impressed by the whole story about Connor. The film is a prefect translation from the book, tje sceneries, soundtrack and actors....unbelievable"
" Excellent But Visually Challenging
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,8,"This movie is a 9 but I removed 1 point for the cinematography. I watched this with my daughter and we both found it difficult (not emotionally) to watch. The film is shot in such a way that you feel like you are in the front row of the cinema. Everything was zoomed right in on.We created our own fix by watching it in windowed mode that allowed us to reduce the screen size to 75%. Once we did that we could settle in and enjoy the show. Others may not have this impact.The film itself is absolutely amazing, so unique and entertaining and the effects are first class. The 'monster' is a superior visual version of Groot.The casting is spot on as each actor contributes to the sincerity of the story.An underlying theme of forgiveness is very fitting for an honest story such as this.Awesome :)"
" Darkly Wonderful
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,8,"A beautiful yet harrowing tale of a young boy dealing with the pain and grief brought about by having to watch his terminally ill mother slowly slip away. How each of us would handle the subject matter will probably determine whether this is a must see film, or an avoid at all costs one. For me it's firmly in the former category."
" Realistic drama served with fantasy
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Very good film a very real drama, in which a young man too young to be a man and too old to be a child has to deal with his mother's terminal illness. The fantasy, made in quality animation, is like the young person's psychologist. It is an emotional and tough film but it is very well done and has an excellent cast.
I strongly recommend it."
" Don't miss this movie
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,9,"I watched it because it initially looked somewhat intriguing, but wow...so very much better than I expected or could have wished for. Visually beautiful, incredibly well-executed, and such a wonderful story. I don't own just any movie, but I will be searching for a copy of this one."
" I LIKED THIS MOVIE A LOT, A NON-INSULTING CHILDREN'S FILM
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,8,"This is how kid's films used to be, dark and ambiguous. Only complaint was the kid was too old in the story to be behaving this way. In the book that this is adapted from the kid's like 8, where here he's like 10 or 12. Apparently, looked it up, the child in the book was a teenager, so ironically a better age in the movie than in the book if the movie is faithful to the source which being written by the author of the book, should be, more or less.It's an amazing and adult look at dealing with an unpleasant inevitably. The kid manifests a story telling tree monster who tells him three tales, and giant talking tree sounds cheesy but is a great vehicle. The tree amazingly voiced by Liam Neeson, tells the boy he'll get three stories and the final story the boy has to tell the tree monster. The two stories the tree tells him are AMAZING, they're not great stories, but the fact that a movie puts in stories that don't have a right or wrong answer to them and is gearing it towards kids, is great. Seriously, way to respect your audience. Also, the different art styles used to tell the story is nice. One of the best children's film I've seen since I was a child and saw Willy Wonka.What a great message to tell children; life's messy and doesn't always wrap things up in a nice bow. Also, to see that the author of the book wrote and directed the movie, was very impressive. I'd be afraid of being too married to my work to also make a watchable movie out of it. He did a great job. Also the story behind the story is pretty cool too. A Monster Calls is part of a series of books that I'm not familiar with. The original author of the series died before finishing it, so this guy pretty much publishes a fan fiction closure to the series with the author's family's blessing. So it's in-canon fan fiction. If I'm remembering the backstory correctly.Anyways, great Movie, heavily recommend, very sad and brutally honest. A great movie for kids 10 and up with valuable lessons."
" Oh boo hoo hoo - far too predictable
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,3,"The animation was lovely. I'd give 10 stars for that. I am guessing the story appeals to people who need to FEEL and there are evidently a lot of these, counting the high reviews and raves for tears. So horribly predictable and they just dragged it out longer and longer and longer. I am a great fan of Patrick Ness (Chaos Walking) and understood he took this on to round out the career of his dying friend, using her structure and characters outlined but not written. Well, ok, but his books are appreciably better than this Lifetime for Women tear jerker. Had a hard time finishing."
" Sublime heartbreak
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,10,"There aren't enough stars in any system to rate this extraordinary film. Simplicity and integrity are at the core of this unique take on a coming of age story. Visually astounding combination of animation and real life action, a muted colour palette and superb cinematography are only some of the delights here. The greatest treat is the genuinely felt no BS narrative of a young man, too old to be a boy, too young to be a man, facing one of life's most painful rites of passage, and summoning anger and rage with a little help from the titular ""Monster"" to come to terms with it. This is no sugary Hallmark card melodrama, or mawkish pop media perspective; the events are a genuine tragedy, but the tone of the film is pitch perfect and manages to not descend to stereotypes of ""it's going to be ok"". That's the ""truth"" the Monster is so keen on, the confusion, the rage, the anger, the acceptance, a state of conflictedness as the norm of human existence and experience. No sweeping platitudinous black and white pseudo comfort is offerred here to our young hero; instead the far more rings-true advice of "" if you feel like breaking something, then by God, break it"". The virtue of the film is that it respects the viewer's intelligence and does not try to pull cheap tricks. What you see and hear and experience while watching is what you get. The dramatization and narrative are kept straightforward without cinematic frippery, because all the effort has been put into developing the emotional turmoil the characters are going through. That emotion floods the cinematic experience we get here. All the characters are played with great conviction, but the young McDougall is an absolute revelation. And Neeson's voicing of the monster is just off the scale, indeed there's something about the eyes of the ""animation"" that resembles Neeson's own facial expression. The ""Monster"" motif is brilliantly conceived as the central theme infusing the action and is a multilayered one. See if you agree with any other viewer about who and what that ""Monster"" is. Sublime, superb, totally unmissable film for anyone with a mind and a heart."
" A true tale of human emotion
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,10,"This is a beautiful movie, it combines childhood like imagination with a very much real story and tells a tale that is both sad but with a shine of hope at the same time, it shows how human emotion is not black and white and does so in an incredibly well done beautiful story.
The animation here is incredibly well done and the stories told within the movie are illustrated very well, definitely a must watch for fans of good and human story telling."
" one of a kind
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie is on of a kind, and it is been so long since i watched an emotional movie like this one , i started to cry when i watched the movie and make you feel all the scene !"
" Beautiful
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,10,A beautiful story of how a young boy faced his own demons. Loved it.
" Good but overrated
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,7,"I honestly want to give this a 6.5 but most films nowadays s&$k so I guess I need to start ranking the somewhat watchable films a little higher. The film has good acting and a well done story but over use things too much and draws out the film to make it much longer than it should have to be. There is a moment where someone from the main character's past comes around and spends time with him. Watching it felt like an hour because the whole thing shouldn't have happened. Personally, I think they just scored a major actor to play the role and didn't want to trim him out of the film. That is just one thing that hurts this film but it is still an okay watch if you're into heavy films."
" A Bit Pointless?
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,5,"I read non-spoiler reviews before watching the movie and there was so much praising that probably I had a bit to high expectations. We could see where it's going and how it's going to end in about maybe 5 minutes of the movie and I kept watching expecting some plot twist, some intrigue, something that would make we go ""wooooow"", but allas, nothing happened. It's ended as anyone would expect it to end. There were some words of wisdom, but not to extent to be awesome or something you never heard. I'm giving it 5 out of 10 because actors did a good job, but besides of the actors you need to have a good story and this one wasn't it, just a very sad and depressing story.Verdict: Not recommended unless, out of sudden, you want to get sad or dpressed"
" A beautiful story!
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,8,"A film with many profound philosophies about human life. See if you are losing direction and need to find answers to your bottlenecks. The film is slow but attractive, with careful investment in images. The actors' acting is very good, portraying the character's inner side. A beautiful story!"
" You've to pass through the first minutes and prepare for tough drama
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,10,"At first glance the story runs a little flat and because of this the environment when fantasy enters scene seams a bit odd; but precisely due to this the stomp of the rest of the movie is just brutal. Photography goes along perfectly, generating a spring of reactions inside the viewer. Really touching."
" A beautiful film
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,8,A truly wonderful film! You will fall in love with this innocent yet realistic take on death.
" Couldn't care less about yew
",2020-07-22 00:00:00,1,"Ah, the desiccated wisdom of trees!This just didn't move me and so I really couldn't see the point of it: characters I would have liked to have cared about, simply irritated me.Something like Having You (2013), with Anna Friel, is a much better bet."
" Baby's first metaphor
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,4,"This movie did everything short of turning to the audience and telling them exactly what the movie is supposed to teach you. Actually, it kinda did that too since the monster and kid keep telling each other what the stories mean. The thesis of the movie is spelled out so clearly as if the director were convinced the audience were too stupid to figure it out.Honestly it's a pretty good film (the visuals are stunning and the actors are good) but they really think we're too stupid to follow a fairy tale plot a la Pan's Labyrinth and that's just offensive."
" Beautiful description of the nature of the human soul!
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,10,"This is not a review, but simply a simple statement. This movie portrays the way the human mind works with such intense honesty that it make you empathize with both the loss of love one for a parent and the nature and the nature of your own fears and monsters."
" The beauty of pain and healing.
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,10,"This is one of those very rare gems that you can watch over and over again and never grow tired of. It captures you from start to finish and keeps filling you with precious sneak peaks of a boy dealing with one of live harshest moments, death! If you're willing to shed a tear or two, you'll see it was oh so worth it."
" Gripping and powerful.
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,9,"A gripping, fascinating, sad uplifting fairy tale. All the performances are excellent. The effects are convincing and the story grips from beginning to end. A great achievement."
" A darkly engaging drama with a deep-rooted sub-plot.
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,7,"This is a cracking story from Patrick Ness with Lewis MacDougall really turning in a first race performance in this tragedy-tinged fantasy drama. As a teenager he has little engagement with school and suffers from disturbing nightmares. His single mother, Felicity Jones, is struggling with terminal cancer and he is largely left to look after himself - and her. His grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) arrives to help take care of him but they don't exactly get along - and coupled with some bullying incidents at school, this all leads him to despair. One night, he is visited by a terrifying tree monster who offers to tell him three true stories so long as he returns the favour afterwards with a fourth, of his own... The story is a wonderful mix of reality and fiction and it is not without humour but ultimately it is about a young lad who must face his own demons."
" I think some may miss the point of this film
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,9,"So, you've probably read a hundred times, it's about a boy who's mother is dying of cancer. I'm not going to list the entirety of the film because it's been said enough.
Flashbacks explain that Mum helped create the monster, tree monster, the big ugly dude voiced by Neeson throughout. The tree monster ushers the boy towards understanding the grief that stands in front of him and how to overcome those demons.
The ending explains a lot. Firstly, mum can see the monster as well, after all, she helped create him. But why? Well, during the closing stages you'll notice a photograph of Mum and her father (happens to be Neeson). Of course the whole thing is in the boys head/dreams hence him smashing the place up when he pictured it was the tree monster and beating the bully up again believing he was backed up by his gruesome friend.
The book of pictures that mum drew at the end explain that these are the stories he has been subjected to. These were stories told to her by her dad and in turn passed on to the boy when he was younger (when she helped put a face to the 'monster'). He used his imagination and creativity with this passed on wisdom to fight his battle and regardless of him creating a pretend friend, he managed to get himself through.
Nice film. Nice to think about it at the end and come to your own conclusions."
" A Monster Calls
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,"A Monster Calls is an adaptation of a Young Adult novel from Patrick Ness.This moody and gloomy film is far from being a kids film that deals with impending loss of a loved one.Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) is a small teenaged boy in the north of England. He is bullied at school and his mother (Felicity Jones) is dying of cancer. Conor shares his mother's artistic flair.His father works in America and his grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) is getting ready to care for him. He finds her distant.One night when the clock strikes 12:07, a pagan tree monster (voiced by Liam Neeson) visits Connor and tells him a story with a twist. He makes subsequent visits at the same time with similar stories.The monster has not arrived to help heal his mother, more to help get over the boy's guilt about his mother's condition.The film is an uneven movie dealing with grief. The bullying storyline is inept. When you get so savagely beaten you will bleed and have bruises. The father randomly turning up and taking Conor to Blackpool was pointless. The film should had got another actor to voice the tree, I think Neeson is typecast with these kind of voice parts.The biggest fault is that Ness is an inexperienced screenwriter as he showed in his Doctor Who spin off Class. Despite some well displayed animation, it is lethargic and lacks drive."
" Loved it!
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"Loved the film,good performances,,though the tree monster was a bit wooden."
" Advertised
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,7,"This is one of those times where an advertising campaign grossly misadvertises the movie. Remember when everyone thought ""Lady in the Water"" was going to be a horror film but it ended up being a fantasy? Same thing here. I thought this was going to be a fun fantasy ""Boy and his creature"" movie in the same vein as ""E.T."" or ""Pete's Dragon,"" but this was actually a very serious drama. It was well acted, the CGI on the monster is some of the best I've ever seen (between this and the Beast in the ""Beauty and the Beast"" remake, I'm getting more and more amazed and impressed at how CGI/motion capture is getting more realistic, without being creepy like with ""Polar Express"") and even the story, though it was depressing was still very well told. My one issue with the casting is that Hollywood for some reason loves to cast Sigourney Weaver in mean roles. Every movie I've seen her in, her character is the meanest in the film. It's been that way for 30 years, to the point where it's almost a trope like ""Sean Bean must die in everything he's in"". She is very good in this, but it's the same character as every other movie she's been in. Personally, I didn't like this movie. I wanted to, but it was just too depressing. There is no hope to this film, and it just leaves you sad. Personally I blame that on the marketing advertising it as something it wasn't. Now that being said, the film is done very well. It's hard to get a huge range of emotion from child actors, and the actor who plays the boy absolultely rocks it. His sadness and anger feel genuine. When he has to come to terms with the bad hand life has dealt him, you understand why he does what he does. Sometimes the film was a bit hard to understand (is the monster real? Is he a metaphor?) and the story didn't flow very well at times. But I get it. The film is based off a book (which I haven't read) so things need to be taken out for time reasons. It was a well-made movie but it was super depressing.
Grade: C 7/10 3.5/5 stars"
" Phenomenal guide to grief
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,9,"""A Monster Calls"" is a 2016 fantasy drama directed by J.A. Bayona starring Lewis MacDougall and Sigourney Weaver. Realistic character dramas do not only play a significant role in the entertainment business, as they also point out certain conflicts that we might or might not experience ourselves in our daily lives and simultaneously give us a chance to understand how the cruel world we live in actually works. Of course the most entries to this genre are primarily made to entertain, but a number of titles also want to teach us something and I think those are needed in some situations we simply can't handle ourselves. To this category this fantasy drama count. How do we cope with life when terminal illness strikes the life of a family, especially when one is just a kid? This film here deals with this delicate topic and elaborates a wonderfully touching story. In the same manner as Del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" it deals with the topic with a genre mix of fantasy and drama, suitable for an audience of children who are too old to be kids, but too young to be grown ups. I'm pretty sure there are countless people out there who have been through the same tragedy and will probably find themselves in here again and I think that's why this film is so tremendously important. It's told through the eyes of a troubled and struggling child and I'm sure that too many of people out there have been exactly this child once in their life. It's not only the premise that makes it work out so well, it's leading actor Lewis MacDougall who's the reason this film hits you right in the feels. His performance is absolutely astonishing and knowing that the newcomer has been going through exactly what his character experiences makes his portrayal even more bittersweet. Honestly, he should have been nominated for countless awards, just saying. Next to him, the rest of the cast has shown brilliance as well. Weaver's performance as the grandmother? Absolutely stunning. Jones's portrayal of the terminal ill mother? Just heartbreaking. It's all completed by a bone chilling voice performance of Liam Neeson as the titular monster. He's both frightening and consoling at the same time and fulfills his role in the film excellently. What furthermore makes this film stand out is how it covers this indeed delicate topic. It's an undeniably devastating and hard to take tragedy, but this film manages to approach it in a for children tolerable way that's not all too depressing, but doesn't sugarcoat it either. It's the perfect amount of sadness for kids to deal with. The visuals also support the film's general message with a superb play of colours and usage of easily understandable illustrations during the tales of the monster. It's carefully teaching lessons about life and that it's not always just black and white, sometimes extremely hard, but never not undoable. This coming of age story gently teaches Connor and the audience about acceptance of loss, compassion and the importance of grief. Step by step, it gets closer to the inevitable tragedy, but always reminds us that we're not alone with it. I'm not ashamed to admit that it had me cry occasionally and hit me right in the feels, but just because it's so absolutely relatable. In the end, it doesn't focus on the illness and doesn't even name it once, it rather focusses on the ones who also suffer immeasurably and gives them a chance and shows them how to cope with the tragic but never desperate truth. All in all, this fable is a welcome alternation to the drama genre and convinces with a sensitive approach to a devastating topic that many people in this world silently suffer from. It gives them a voice and it will most likely make you cry or at least make you feel extremely emotional with it's amazing cast and phenomenal message. It's a fantastic guide to grief that doesn't deny the shadow sides of life and always reminds that there's still positivity in tragedies. A must see for anyone who has been through similar experiences. But be sure to pack enough tissues. Unexpectedly outstanding drama."
" Probably the best example of one of these kinds of 'a fantasy land or a monster is a stand in for a child understanding his trauma'.
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Lewis MacDougall leads a raw and authentic performance, it's nice to see Sigourney Weaver but her accent is a little jarring. The VFX, concept designs, and the authentic photography and locations of England are all pretty solid. There's very little pandering in this movie and very little of the generic American faff that usually accompanies these films. It's quite talky and the four tales conceit doesn't translate easily to the screen, but I can imagine it being a very important film to young children or anyone struggling with this kind of grief, it's a meaty, heartfelt and complex look at this from a child's perspective. Sensitively and artfully told. It's nice to see a picture of the Grandad as Liam Neeson who provides the monsters voice, a small secret to show how grief affects all generations in different but also the same ways."
" Please read the book also !
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,8,"This is the only book I've ever read where I felt a physical reaction -- Every chapter was emotionally exhausting, I had to stop after every story; felt a deep sense of dread even thinking about picking it up again, and was utterly drained at the end.The movie captures a good measure of this, though some impact is lost in moving the monster from imagination to CGI. Please read the book, preferably the print version which has much better quality illustrations: The kindle version reproduces them poorly."
" Wow
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,8,That is the best word to describe this hidden gem of a movie. Just... wow.
" I don't care
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,1,"I don't care if I'm the only one on this earth who thinks this movie is so boring ! The drama is too much .. the bullies were too stupid ! The only thing I liked was the first story ! The other three were just ""Eeeh"" .. I expected it to be more adventurous .. much more with fairy characters .. and a lot more in a forest !The script for the boy was too mature to be his talking .. you can tell it's a grown up script rather than a little boy ..By the end I just skipped it because I started feel sleepy and bored to death with everything !"
" Masterful and spellbinding
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful and very moving acted to perfection by main cast members. The emotions just pour out, and the music score and CGI are spot on. You don't need a lot of effects to tell a good story - you need a good story to create the imagination and let the movie carry you through what perhaps evokes your own memories. I loved it very much."
" A most feeling story.
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,10,"No reason to discuss whatever this film is for youngsters or grownups. It is for people!
It's one of the most feeling story's in it's category in new time and with powerful Liam Neeson as the voice of the monster, you'll be taken in to a world we all recognise in real life. 10 stars, but certainly worth more. /Weltz, Denmark."
" Sehr gut, aber kein Kinderfilm
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,9,"Zunächst einmal muß ich festhalten, daß der deutsche Titel einmal mehr völliger Schwachsinn ist, aber sei es drum. A Monster Calls ist ein zutiefst bewegender und berührender Film, der es schafft eine ernste Thematik sehr behutsam aufzuarbeiten, ohne dabei auch nur im Geringsten kitschig zu sein.Allerdings ist dieses kleine Meisterwerk in meinen Augen absolut kein Kinderfilm, respektive für Kinder mit 12 Jahren, wie es die deutsche USK vorgibt, definitiv nicht geeignet. Ich würde den Film ab 14 Jahren freigeben und das nicht etwa, weil er besonders gruselig wäre, sondern weil er sich mit einem Thema befaßt, das Kinder in einem gewissen Alter in dieser Form noch gar nicht richtig einordnen oder verarbeiten können (sollten).
Grob umrissen, ohne etwas zu verraten, geht es darum, wie ein Junge mit (ich glaube) 12 Jahren den Krebstot seiner Mutter erlebt und bewältigt und daneben mit allerlei anderen psychischen und sozialen Problemen fertig werden muß.Ich selbst habe aufgrund einer Krebserkrankung mehrere Therapien hinter mir und kann daher einigermaßen einschätzen, wie Kinder, Familienangehörige und Freunde sich dieser Problematik stellen. In jeder sozialen Gruppe findet das anders statt. Aber diese Variante hier ist ausgesprochen gut erzählt und mit einem Tüpfelchen wohltuender Magie garniert.Aufgrund der Medikamente, die ich nehme, u. a. auch Antidepressiva, vermag mich normalerweise nicht mehr viel emotional zu erschüttern. Diese Geschichte ist jedoch so gut, daß selbst ich noch ein paar Tränen übrig hatte.Ganz großes Kino!"
" Tissue box for monster tears
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,8,"Great CGI. Super cute animations. The sound design is basically ASMR! The story is emotional, you might cry. All portraited in a very sweet way. Although you might be a little ""scared"" if you're a kid. This review is from a big baby's perspective. It's also a little philosophical. It's about being kindred to your imagination. Lewis Macdougall made a great performance. Lovely."
" A must see for those facing the loss of a loved one
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,8,"What can I say. This is a movie that appears to be aimed at those who have to live with the fact that someone close will die in the not too distant future. The underlying theme is how to comprehend this imminent loss and live the rest of your life without it eating away at your insides. Brilliantly thought out, but a little slow for those outside the lesson parameters. All hospitals with cancer patients in particular should have a copy of this film to show to close family members of those who are about to die."
" A Successor for Tim Burton and Neil Jordan stood up
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,8,"I'm very grateful to this particular Belgian TV-station for broadcasting ""A Monster Calls"" last weekend, but at a certain point during the film, I also came quite close to suing them. The reason for this is that they announced the film as a fantasy-adventure for the entire family. I can assure, however, that my two children (aged 10 and 4) were practically traumatized by the sight of the tree-monster, and that my wife (aged 38) consumed nearly three boxes of Kleenex handkerchiefs whilst crying over the sad plot. Just to say that ""A Monster Calls"" is an intense and totally absorbing film; - which is positive again in the end, though. Personally, I'm a tremendous admirer of so-called ""adult fairytales"" and gazed at ""A Monster Calls"" with pure admiration. The narration and atmosphere are reminiscent to some of the best (older) work of master story-tellers, like Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Sleepy Hollow"") and Neil Jordan (""The Company of Wolves"", ""Ondine""), and the special effects are - by lack of a better word - stupendous! With this film, Spanish director J.A. Bayona (""The Orphanage"") profiles himself as the only worthy successor of the two aforementioned geniuses, and I sincerely hope he'll make more fantasy/fairytales like this.Also, I don't know who came up with the idea, but it was a downright brilliant idea to cast Liam Neeson as the voice of the Monster. He emerges as a humongous tree, with a mission to teach a few valuable life-lessons to 12-year-old Connor. The boy's life certainly isn't easy. His beloved mother is slowly but surely dying from cancer, his father lives in the US but only comes to visit, and he's being bullied at school. With its harsh and confronting ""stories"", the Monster teaches Connor that happy endings aren't real and that enemies aren't always who they seem. Obviously ""A Monster Calls"" primarily aims at making the audience feel emotional and cry, but nevertheless, I've rarely seen a film that so open and honest deals with sensitive topics like terminal illness and trauma acceptance. The monster's stories are wondrously animated, the British countryside looks grim and depressing, and the performances are very powerful. 14-year-old Lewis MacDougall carries the film remarkably well, although with sublime support from Felicity Jones (as the mother) and Sigourney Weaver (as the grandmother)."
" Moving on is hard
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,10,"Forget child fantasies and fairytails. This movie fast-forwards a kid through tough life experiences. The story of the movie impressed me to tears as the main character's forced to accept his humanity, his 'weaknesses' in exceptional situations like loosing probably the most important person in his life at a fragile age."
" Incredible Actor!
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,9,"Young actor Lewis MacDougall is incredibly emotive and expressive, which makes this movie so freaking good. There are actors who don't even have half of his range and I hope he gets more acting opportunities because talent like this shouldn't be wasted."
" Beautiful movie
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,8,I loved this movie. So beautiful. Sad but not morbid. Stunning cgi. Great story telling. Very moving and touching. Acted with feeling and heart. Watched the kid who would be king not so long ago and the difference in child actors. Well. Night and day. That movie was a horrific in terms of acting ability. This one. A monster calls. The acting by everyone but most of all the boy was superb.
" Strong to the brain

" Impeccable
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,10,"This film is a perfectly executed emotional ride. The visuals are stunning, and the story hits with the force of a freight train. Absolutely incredible."
" A must see
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,8,"Facing a close relative's death is no doubt one of the most difficult challenges in everyone's life. It gets even more difficult while that someone is your mother and it gets exponentially worse while you are a child.About A Monster Calls, making it simple and short, this movie explains that difficult situation in which you see it from the perspective of the child. That is hilarious. at some points I remembered the Fountain especially through the story of the healing powers of the tree and its connection with the real story.One may think the real trauma must be more horrifying and it is somehow true but the process of fighting with the reality and walking across the sharp edge of hope, believe and letting go has been brilliantly pictured in this movie.so not even A Monster Calls worth watching but also it is a must see."
" A movie that packs an enormous emotional punch in its quietest scenes
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,9,"Directed by J.A. Bayona and was released back in 2016. At first i was so sceptical about this movie, simply because i've read the novel and it was THAT good. It got me sobbing and crying all night, trust me lads the novel is effing good. The story itself is a beautiful and inspirational depiction of a person's battle with grief, that being said that person is actually a young boy named connor who seeked help of a tree moster to face his problems. When his mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness which was cancer, connor was left feeling desperate, he was so in denial thinking that his mother is gonna be okay and everything's gonna be just fine. During his everyday life, connor became increasingly isolated thanks to all the bullies at his school then he came back home wounded(because of those bullies) and spent the evening comforting and helping his terminally illed mother because he only had her as his father lived in the US with his new family. Later at night, amidst the uncertainty and pain connor was awaken by a mysterious tree-like-monster who promised to tell the boy three stories about how he conquered his enemies. After that it would be connor's responsibility to tell the truth despite his fear of the moster. Connor began to view his supernatural visitor (the tree monster) with a hope that he might be able to save his mom from dying. The visitants were evoked by strands of thick ropes that are twisted and tangled to form the trunk and swaying branches of a yew tree.
Then the stories began, connor believed that the moster came walking to heal his mother. He realised that the moster didn't come to heal his mother but him instead when the third story was told. As the final story was told, it was connor's turn to tell the hidden truth, so he shared, the truth is that he just wanted it to be over, he couldnt stand the fact that his mother was gonna leave him for real. He was filled with tears as he sobbed because he simply didn't want to lose his mom. As he finished his truth, his grandma came and picked him up due to emergency at the hospital, connor knew that its ""the"" time, the monster stood by him and he finally said to his mom ""mom, i don't want you to go"" he hugged his mom and said ""i don't want you to go"" again, at this point i was flooded with tears i was crying like craaaaaaaaazy. His mom finally died. I was like no no no, my heart couldn't take this.
The movie itself is soooo good and beautiful and just heartbreaking, i watched it for like 4 times already. The scenery, the plot, the story are just beyond outstanding, i do recommend yall to watch this cuz itll be your loss if you don't. Yall should watch a movie like this at least once in life. Everyone needs a good cry sometimes and this movie should provide you your need."
" Who's the Target Audience?
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,7,"I won't beat around the bush, and say that the best answer is probably 'kids', kids a similar age to Conor. But this movie, as others have asserted, is so much more than a story for children - as is any good ""kids"" movie - it's also a contemplation of childhood.That's where I feel this movie falls short. It, to me, did not appear to transcend a flat and mostly denotative depiction of its themes. The monster feels rather blunt, not much more than an (imaginary) physicalisation of Conor's fears about death. Conor's bullies seem to have no clear motivation and are at times inexplicable, seemingly existing for no more than to deepen our sympathy for Conor and to transparently declare another major theme about invisibility.There's so much here for adults that I was ready to consider this a fully 'adult' film; but there's little magic beneath the surface, I feel. This film is a turbulent pool of deep, heavy themes, a turgent sea of death and pain and loss.And maybe it's Bayona's greatest triumph - just maybe - that this film set inside a child's mind so critically fails to grasp beyond."
" Monster calls you to watch this masterpiece
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,10,"Personally I believe that point of any art - if it is painting, music or cinematography - is nothing more but to move something within us, to touch us and make us reflect. This movie touched every part of me, I was not impressed like this for a while, and the story is seemingly so simple, what an experience.The moral lessons flowing out of the screen never seem to end. The movie shows that nothing in life is ever black or white, that love is an amazing force, that everything in our lives shapes us but pain especially.I thought that anyone who's experienced a loss maybe too deeply affected by this movie but after some reflection I think all such people should watch it more than anyone. If only to realise again how the people who are no longer with us helped us on our own paths, it is so very often forgotten and clouded by sadness, which is of course natural. We often forget to embrace the beautiful moments we've spent with them and the impact they've had on us, we shall not forget that for a second.Besides death itself, ""The Monster calls"" also touches on another subject - connection between a mother and son, something truly exceptional. Reminds us that the strongest bond of all can also shatter, that's just life, messy, as Conor's dad sums it up.The story is told in a little bit of an irregular pace which I found very inviting, it does make you slightly addicted to these emotional moments. I knew that I would be even more badly moved and yet I couldn't wait to see more. The constant emotional tension is something very difficult to achieve and it was even hard to bear at times.Taking the whole emotional load into consideration the monster portrays the way children can deal with stressful situations and tries to make us feel what Connor feels. Getting inside his head is so believable and made his pain as well as love truly real.The great story with real life and imagination entanglement, followed by top end acting, intense musical and visual art and well written script sum up to one of the best movies I have seen in a while.Be brave and watch it, you will not regret."
" The dichotomy of human

" Dramatic as well as spectacular Spanish/British/US co-production based on a prestigious novel and masterfully directed by Juan Antonio Bayona
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Stirring and tragical story based on a notorious novel and competently directed by Juan Antonio Bayona . Including an engaging screenplay by Patrick Ness , based upon the novel written by himself from an original idea by Siobhan Dowd . A devastating event happens in the life of a little boy , twelve-year-old Conor (Lewis MacDougall) , as he seeks the help of a tree monster to cope with his single mother's (Felicity Jones) terminal . Meanwhile , he must face his stiff-upper-lip grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) , his estranged father (Toby Kobbel) and the school bully . This is one family's moving story of sadness and love . As Conor is caught in a chaotic self-destruction , when he then is visited by the tree-like Monster (Lian Neeson) , who tells Conor it has to come to tell him three true stories . However , nothing is more powerful than the human spirit . Stories are wild creatures. Courage conquers all . Will he survive ?It's a grade A picture , a gem , absorbing , riveting , highly moving , incredibly tense .This is a very touching story about a boy who feels very damaged , unsettling , guilty and mostly angry , as well as his relationship with a benevolent and wise tree-like monster that has points in common with Treebeard the Ent from Lord of the Rings . This is a psychological/exciting/thrilling drama in which a boy becomes involved into a terrible tragedy . It is a smart and sensitive flick filled with intense drama , thrills , emotion , tear-jerker , state-of-art special effects , and pretty entertaining , though overlong . The complex plot deals with a tree-monster who tells three tales and after which Conor must tell the Monster his own story: the truth behind his nightmare, which Conor refuses to do. Interesting and thought-provoking screenplay based on a novel that was originally started by Siobhan Dowd who left it unfinished, at her death. Patrick Ness finished the book with credits to her idea. This stirring pic is a tightly-knit drama centered on the relentless personal fight , as it follows an affected boy suffering extreme bullying , and a seriously wounded mother , as she struggles to survive . The picture makes up for it with an evolving atmosphere of anxiety and fear . Everything in Juan Antonio Bayona 's impressive film looks so real that you might think it's a highly fantastic movie full of imagination and color , thanks to the sensational animated images and cartoon resolution . And a great main and support cast , such as Lewis MacDougall , Sigourney Weaver , Felicity Jones , Toby Kebbell . And Liam Neeson, who provides the voice of the Monster , appears as Conor's grandfather in the photo of Conor's mother as a little girl being carried by her father .Lavishly produced by Enrique López Lavigne , Belen Atienza , Patrick Ness , Bill Pohlad , Jeff Skoll , Patrick Wachsberger , among others.There is the urgent hand-held camera-work, a trademark refined and perfected by cameraman Oscar Faura , which lends an air of pseudo-authenticity to carefully staged reconstructions, putting us right there in the huddle of the action . Shot in various locations as Castlefield, Manchester, Greater Manchester, England, Cabrils, Barcelona, Catalonia, Delph, Greater Manchester, England, UK , the school scenes were shot at Colne Valley High School in Linthwaite, Huddersfield, England. Furthermore , an emotive as well as enjoyable musical score by Fernando Velazquez .The motion picture was compellingly directed by Juan Antonio Bayona who proved his usual aesthetics and nail-biting filmmaking as well as he formerly made in ¨the orphanage¨and ¨The imposible¨or ¨Lo imposible¨ . Bayona has directed 1 actress to an Academy Award-nominated performance: Naomi Watts (Best Actress, Lo imposible or the impossible (2012) and Sigourney Weaver in this ¨A monster call¨. Rating : This excellent film results to be above average , a really magnificent movie . Essential and indispensable seeing . The picture will appeal to J.A. Bayona fans ."
" I don't write reviews much. I just logged in to give this a 10 out of 10.
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,10,"Short and sweet summary:Set in the UKSigourney Weaver pulls off a role as a UK grandma with English accent and all.Fairy-tale type parts intertwined with very authentic day to day reality.Harrowing, sad subject matter. You're a heartless brute if your eyes don't at least get moist.The acting is all round amazing. Jaw-dropping , totally transfixing stuff. The main character, the kid, should get a Nobel Prize, never mind an Oscar, and Sigourney Weaver pulling off the Brit grandma role like that reminded me what 'professionalism' is supposed to mean. Good lord, it's something to behold. All the actors/actresses seemed to have given it their all here.Cruel, grey reality spliced with occasionally even animated multicolour tales and CGI.The story is real, believable, even gritty - hence the contrast with the 'fantasy' type labelling.Don't think this is a fantasy tale. It's a top-class production that ought to be in the top ten films ever created and the subject matter is simply the complexity and depths of the human experience."

" Brilliant but sad
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,8,"This was a brilliant film with great special effects, great acting and most of all a great story. It tells the fears and pain of a young boy dealing with his terminally ill mum through stories and metaphors. Anyone who's ever lost a loved one through an illness will totally relate to this and I guarantee the tears will be flowing.
As brilliant as this film is, it's equally heartbreaking."
" The concept is what we missing for the children
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,8,"What I loved the most is the concept behind the movie. There is no pure evil and no pure good, ""most people are in between"" as the yes tree monster said. 
I really became to hate the traditional fairy tales where there is always a pure evil character who doesn't have the slightest amount of good and vice versa. This is not reality."
" Nice movie, thanks for the reminder and the huntsman
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,6,"Good movie, good storytelling and good quality of work"
" Curiously torn about this one. And that might be part of the point?
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,7,"Probably like mamy others I tend to confuse this film with Spielbergs BFG simply because of the similarities in marketing and it probably hurt its sales more than it should. Because despite my critisisms. There is a great film here.My main gripe is how it feels not so much like a Spielberg ripoff as it feels like a director desperately wanting to be Guilermo del Toro, a filmmaker I feel is overrated in some ways himself . Things feel so heavyhanded at times that I wonder if I'll be leaving the film with my face black and blue from the bruises. But suddenly. About the halfway point the actual goal becomes apparent. The point that sometimes kids (and adults too) just want to be punished for sins they believe they commited. And the film brings home the lesson repeatedly. ""What could possibly be the point in that?"" And you are forced to confront the whole reasoning behind the concept of ""punishment"". And as the kid wrecked a room and both grandma and father refuses the kneejerk responses we assumed were coming and instead tried to build up a broken boy instead of breaking him further. That's the point that the film suddenly went from ""dear god this is tediously derivative"" to something almost profound at times. At least for me.These moments continue throughout and the lessons of not assuming that simplistic moralistic forces are at work at all times does become increasingly clear. It's just a crying shame that interspersed between those insightful moments I was so dreadfully pained by the obvious saccharin and run of the mill family movie moments that felt more forced than natural. In short. I just wish that the director kept his attention at what the story needed because if he did it would quickly move the score from good/great with caveats to a damned masterpiece. All the above being said however. If you aren't as allergic to the factors I griped about I would highly recommend the film simply because I honestly think the lessons herein is humbling and worth contemplating for all ages."
" Awful doesn't begin to describe how bad this movie is
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,3,"This movie is yet another example of how I/we can be fooled. Look at all the glowing reviews, high user ratings, 3 superb actors. How could this movie at least not be decent?It isn't even decent because among the script, the concepts, every aspect of the movie, nothing works. I don't demand that a movie be great in order to like it, yet I can't think of anything redeeming about this movie. It is silly, it is stupid, it is vapid, it is ridiculously bad. A boy is grieving that his mother is dying of cancer, and he has to face his deepest fears, both in his waking life and in his dream world. He is bullied at school (and this isn't done very well either). A monster comes along who has the answers; well, he doesn't have the answers, because as he says, life is complicated, humans are complicated. So boy, just face the world, tell/live the truth, do the best you can, life is tough. Yes, this is a monster: he is tough, but he is also gentle, kind, patient. Oh, he speaks such profound truths in that monster voice of his. It's pathetic, really.The boy has this bizarre need to destroy things. He destroys everything in his grandmother's sitting room. Yet everyone, including the monster, tells the boy that it's just fine: if you need to destroy, then destroy you must. The great Sigourney Weaver, though at least her English accent is passable, has absolutely no chemistry with the actor who plays the boy, and maybe that's because his performance is vile.Yes, the special effects with the monster are quite good - that's the only decent thing about this joke of a movie.Nobody seems to get one of the obvious truths of this story, which is that the boy is in his own way is clearly a monster. And now, having exorcised my own demons about this awful movie, I can put this bad experience behind me."
" Amazing
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,10,"This film is just incredible. Beautiful story, amazing acting (especially Lewis MacDougall!!!!), incredible animation... it's just beautiful."
" Very sad
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,7,Not as expected. Very dark and sad. But great actors and effects.
" An all-round perfect film!!
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,10,"Director J.A Bayona brought us 'The Orphanage', which is one of my favorite Spanish films. He then brought us 'The Impossible', which is one of my favorite films. And now 'A Monster Calls'. Oh my goodness, I hardly have words to describe how absolutely amazing this film was!!Apart from the impressive visuals, the film had a really great story. This was an interesting blend of heart wrenching drama and over-the-top amazing visual effects, and both were equally awesome. Due to the nature of its theme and the way the fantasy elements are presented, it all makes perfect sense, so the film will appeal to an audience who does not like fantasy films, as well. The acting is fantastic, especially from Lewis MacDougall, who plays the young boy. The giant tree together with Liam Neeson voicing it at times made me feel I was watching Optimus Prime from The Transformers, only here the character - or monster if you like - was a visual manifestation of the boy's over-active imagination as well as fighting his inner demons. The film was just perfect on every level, with an incredible message that will make you shed a tear or two. It tugs at the heartstrings with perfect friction. This was STUNNING!"
" Emotionally resonant and visually vibrant.
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,7,"'A Monster Calls (2017)' is the kind of 'fantasy as allegory' that's so often made all the less ambiguous, one way or the other, precisely because of its format. Film isn't quite able to achieve the kind of unspoken uncertainty that novels often inherently carry, considering the all-encompassing perspective of written fist-person narratives, but not every story is meant to work both literally and figuratively - though many often do and I can't speak to the intentions of the source-material (which I haven't read). My point is that some material perhaps has more impact if it makes itself as definitive as possible. Such is the case with this feature, which never really has any pretences about its more outlandish elements and always frames them as the coping mechanisms of a child - though the occasionally more tangible moment does break this illusion somewhat. While the stranger elements perhaps don't work as well as they would have in a piece totally told from the perspective of our unreliable narrator of a protagonist, the film comes together to tell a tale as old as time in a distinct way that actually allows it to be widely accessible and incredibly emotionally resonant, to boot. 7/10"
" Your truth
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,9,"At first i thought meh, cliché story, bullied boy escapes his reality into fantasie.
But that's partially true, the further into the movie the more i felt his emotions.
When the third story had been told and seeks out his mom, i cracked, i cracked even more when he had to tell the monster the fourth story about ""his truth""
It messed with my feelings completely.
I liked the ending very much, it had closure, no guessing, no open ending, everything felt in place. 
Well done.The cgi was good, the storyline was good.
You see that this boy struggles to coop with the reality."
" A fairy tale amidst reality
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,5,"A not uninteresting story about a boy engaging in a difficult reality of parental ill health and problems at school, who is drawn into a fantastical segway with a tree monster who tells him three tales with a rider that the boy must respond with one of his own. (I felt short-changed by the third tale).The film did not flow seamlessly enough for my taste. I found it stilted and perhaps that is why I felt unconvinced by it at times.I did like the review from another contributor who mentioned that the film made her dog cry. (Perhaps her canine felt that sticks could be put to better use?)."
" Beautiful, moving and deeply profound.
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,9,"What a beautiful, haunting and profound film. It's about a boy whose mother is dying (his mother is separated from his father, who now lives abroad). The boy is visited at night by a monster in the form a of a large tree growing within sight of his house, who on each visit tells him one of three stories; he says on the final visit the boy must tell him a story which must be true. It's as simple as that - yet utterly beautiful and moving. Each of the stories is told as wonderfully stylised piece of animation (the rest of the film is live action); the rest of the action narrates the relationships between the boy, his mother, his father and grandmother, as well as the boy's problems at school. It made me think of so much - the effect of loss and trauma on a young life, and how much my precious foster children have lost in so little time, and the creative steps they have to take to cope the loss. It made me think of my own losses, and how I live with them, deal with them and create a life that tries to encompass them and somehow grow through them. And it made me think of my own failings as a son and a father. It's one of the most moving films I've seen in years, directed with great power and economy, performed with lovely understatement that is allowed to cut loose at crucial moments. Highly recommended."

The bond between a mother and son is the main theme of the movie, and it's treated with such care and tenderness through the sad parts that it's impossible not to cry. I loved this movie, because it pictures those bad desires/thoughts that we humans get sometimes and that we don't want to get, and turns it into something beautiful and understandable. The acting of the child is impeccable. Even when working with such difficult themes, he manages to portray all the anguish and pain that this movie is about. Moreover, the animated parts of the movie are truly a work of art, and it's clear just with how much care they have been created. All in all, a masterpiece of a movie. Bayona, no matter what type of movie he creates, will always manage to grab your heart and break it into little pieces and make you like it."
" A New Star Calls
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,9,"I haven't seen him in his film debut, Pan, but after his absolutely eminent performance in A Monster Calls, there's no doubt - a new star calls for the actor's stardom sky. Lewis MacDougall's ability to bring one's emotional dephts into rare motions is simply astonishing. For the director and other cast to be working with this brilliant young actor must have been nothing but a special experience and a pleasure. The prestigious Sigourney Weaver does her best roles in a long time, and the excellent Felicity Jones shows again that she belongs up there, but MacDougall outshines them both, together with any other actor that I've seen in resent years. Yes, this is a good and absolutely well made film in so many ways, but it's really not necessary to say, because how could it possibly matter?"
" This is something else!

" Exquisitely painful
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,10,"Conor is having a bad time. Bullied at school, suffering a recurrent nightmare, and trying to cope with his mother's progressive illness, he is visited at night by a monster tree-man from the yew tree in the local churchyard who tells him three stories, and expects the true story of Conor's nightmare in return.This film takes Conor's real-life problems - very real, and all centred around his mother's illness - and smashes them face-first into the fantasy figure of the tree monster and his stories, fearsome and compassionate at the same time. This may not sound terribly convincing, but it works extremely well.The story came from a writer who died of the cancer which inspired her story before she was able to write the book: the author who worked her idea into a (childrens) book has also written the screenplay, and the stories-within-the-story are animated in the style of the watercolour illustrations in the original book. And this is some of the most beautiful animation you will see anywhere. Coupled with the CGI tree-man, there are some exquisite visuals on show here, interwoven seamlessly with the rather shabbily picturesque locations.Felicity Jones is good as the stricken mother, Sigourney Weaver does a brilliant job as the unsympathetic grandmother rather gracelessly making plans to take care of Conor afterwards, while dealing with her daughter's imminent death, a death which Conor is having such difficulty facing. Liam Neeson as the voice of the monster is amazingly good, and Lewis McDougal as Conor is stunning.All of which contributes to the emotional impact of this film, which is brutal. There is no niceness about what happens here, but it is dealt with compassionately and kindly as well as painfully. I sat in the darkness weeping as Grandma and Conor finally find a way to meet each other in a car stopped at traffic lights, and also as the Monster finally rips the truth of Conor's nightmare out of him. And as for the photograph of Mum and her father...This film hurt like hell, and I loved it."
" Moving Coming Of Age Film
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,8,"A Monster Calls: A boy suffers bullying at school, his mother is seriously ill, he doesn't get on with his grandmother. All of this forces him into a fantasy world where a Monster Tree (played by Liam Neeson) comes to life and tells him three tales. As well as the tree being CGI/Animatronics, the Monster's tales are played out in animation.A moving, coming of age film which also contains adult themes and no, Neeson's acting wasn't wooden. 8/10."
" Bedtime stories from a monster
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,7,"A young boy is having visions of a tree like monster that visits him at night.
The visitations coincide with him being bullied at school and his strained relationship with his mother and grandmother.The characters, effects, production and story are all great!
You really get sucked into the life of the main character and there are quite a few anxious scenes where he is trying to come to terms his life.The monster dispenses some short stories in cartoon format which helps break up the relatively bleak and slow real action.I didn't find there to be many surprises but although I could see what was coming up ahead when the movie got there I was still gripped.This is an excellent movie, however, I don't think it is a spoiler to say that this film is not a barrel of laughs and it is quite slow.Watch this on a big TV with the sound turned up to get the most of the monster scenes."
" Monster forces us to cry..
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,10,"This was a outstanding movie,I have zero clue why this movie was not nominated at Oscars.First of all,Its tells life of a little kid who was alone and her mother was seriosuly ill,and guy was helpless and tree came to his aid out of nowhere.Why would they call him monster is also another mystery to meIn his nightmare's he saw that her mother tumble down the cliff in a graveyard.Towards to end of the movie he did see that her mother dies in dream.When her mother finally dies tree was behind him , and later on same tree was his mother's friend as she send off her father's to his death.We didnt see that Liam Neelson's acting but his voice made this movie amazing."

",2018-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Your monster may be cancer, it may be sickness, it may be losing someone close to you, or not being pretty enough, not having enough money, not good enough in some way... we all have monsters.Sometimes if we just tell the truth about our monsters they don't seem so scary. If we just admit to them we can have a bit of compassion for our fears and worries and the human condition we find ourselves in. Conor O'Malley finds a place within himself of telling the truth about one of his monsters... something so hideous he could never admit it to himself or anyone else before (wanting his mother dead).Telling the truth frees him just as it frees all of us when we can find a place of acceptance for how we actually are without hiding or putting on pretensions. This film is deep and touching and I would like to somehow reward every person involved in the making of it."
" Emotional and touching
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,9,"This movie is dark and beautifully made. the acting is great, and the effects are stunning. With other words, you should watch this movie if you like deep films with a message. This movie is probably not suitable for people who only like fun and lighthearted movies, as it is pretty dark. Some people might find it too depressing, but it is a really good film if you like these type of movies. This is coming-of-age drama that will stay in your memory."
" Closest to making me get a tear in the eye
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,10,"This film is simply a beautiful masterpiece. It makes you care for the characters, feel sorry for characters. It has style and looks good. Music on point, acting on point, story on point! I've never cried to a movie, I don't get tears in my eyes. This might have gotten a little tear in the corner of my eye. This movie is just, fantastic. Watch it."
" A little gem
",2018-01-12 00:00:00,10,"In an imaginary world a monster comes to aid a kid to deal with his personal grief and makes him leave childhood behind.This moving story is deployed in a fairish atmosphere, which strongly reminded me of del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"": a bitter pill to swallow but with a cleansing aftertaste. Rarely such a feeling of catharsis overwhelms the audience. Protagonist is a little child who must cope with his mother's terminal illness. A monster awakes, the two worlds come together and the kiddo is challenged to discover the seemingly horrible, yet human truth inside him. A definite must, just a word of caution, however: prepare some tissues, and make sure you are not barely making it through a depressive phase in life."
" Hugely predictable
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,4,"A MONSTER CALLS is another film centred around the folklore figure of the 'tree man' already thoroughly explored in everything from GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY to LORD OF THE RINGS and THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA. This time around he's a friendly creature who visits a mixed-up young boy to tell him stories in the dead of night. It turns out the kid's mother is dying of cancer, so the tree man is there to help him cope and grieve. Yeah, it's a rather cynical film that goes for the obvious approach throughout, but merely comes across as depressing. The actors fail to really get into their roles and a miscast Sigourney Weaver and her off-putting British accent don't help, although Toby Kebbell comes across well as always. The tree man scenes go overboard on the CGI and Liam Neeson merely reprises his Aslan role with a voice full of gravity. I found the whole thing hugely predictable, copying the likes of THE BFG somewhat shamelessly, and imparting a message that would take 10 minutes tops to film."
" above average
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,7,"I liked it. Acting was well done and the story was fine, too .. but a little stereotypical. I had expected a darker tone though .. and was periodically a little bored.To me, it felt like a very, very silent, slow movie .. with very predictable storyline. I particularly liked Sigourny weavers performance.Maybe i did not quite enjoy it as much as it deserves, cause my friend was constantly complaining about not watching a ""real horror"" movie.The effects were .. well.. not very good though.. it felt like there were comprable cutscene effects in some video games - and the CGI did not blend in with the live action well."
" Very strong, and beautiful, portrayal of grief
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'A Monster Calls' has almost nothing to do with a monster - at it's heart, it's a straightforward story about a 12-year-old boy dealing with grief, with help from an imaginary friend. It's from Bayona, the director of 'The Impossible' (another very good survival drama), so it will be interesting to see what he does with 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom'. The film centers around Conor (MacDougall), a quiet kid who loves to draw, who has a sick Mum (Jones) and a stern Grandma (Weaver). At 12:07am each night, he has a dream/nightmare where he hears a tree-monster calling him.Filmed in Manchester, there's plenty of rain and opportunities for spooky shadows and scares, but the beauty is in the benevolent twist taken on the Groot-like ""monster"" (Neeson), who is obviously Conor's way of dealing with his mum's cancer. The watercolour animations set to Neeson's storytelling is excellently done, with some nice morals thrown in to the ""dreams"" Conor has when the ""monster"" is present.It never gets too fantastic or unrealistic, with MacDougall successfully carrying a great load for such a young actor. He's helped expertly by Jones & Weaver, who have very significant, but relatively small, roles. It's not sad the entire film, but it really hits home for the final 15min and did not leave a dry eye in the cinema."
" A great movie about a sad topic
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,9,"Warning spoilers!I passed on this movie when it was released theatrically and then on initial home video release. I found this movie in the 2 for $1 rental (blu-ray) at my local brick and mortar video store. On side note, great bass for home theater when the tree monster (voiced by Liam Neeson) walks and very good video quality.This is a well-acted, well-written and great story about a sad topic (terminal illness of a mother). Much like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is not a fantasy movie for young children though both have fantasy elements. Still I think pre-teens on up in age are ok to watch this if they are willing to watch and then discuss this thoughtful movie.Amazing performance all around and especially by the actor playing Connor.Even lIttle touches (easter egg) in movie like blink and you'll miss it serve the story: e.g. old picture of Liam Neeson (as human) with his movie wife (Sigourney Weaver's) character. Too bad this movie ""bombed"" at the box office. Instead poorly written tent-pole movies like Star Wars 8 The Last Jedi collect the money and fill the theatres."
" A Teared Apart Heart Calls
",2017-12-19 00:00:00,9,"In fact both the title and the poster of this film are quite misleading. At first I thought it's just another fairy-tale-like story about a boy and a monster. Than I decided it's something more like mild horror story. However this picture is neither.What you'll see on your screens - is a beautiful and sad story about a kid trying to put up with inevitable. The kid with teared apart heart. The kid fighting and reconciling with his inner monster. The way the story line is presented appealed to me a lot. Half-fairy, half-real world shows us the world and situation through the boy's eyes. And no matter how gloomy, dark or sorrowful the atmosphere and plot could seem the end of the film is happy - the boy managed to accept the loss of his mother and to let her go... which was exactly the thing he tried to do all the film."
" People are not bad or good, they are somewhere in the middle
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,10,"Conor is experiencing the worst time that has fallen to his share in childhood - the gradual extinction of the life of the most beloved and dearest person in the world - Mom. In an attempt to save himself from the pain of loss, which he is already capable of exposing to reality in a dream, Conor calls on the Monster, who will tell him three stories in return for a story he tells the young man himself.This tragic film is not a fairy tale told to children at night and, moreover, an entertaining film designed to cheer up the audience with bright scenes and merry moments. "" A Monster Calls"" - an instructive drama that raises an uneasy and very painful topic for each of us - the loss of a loved one. In this drama, fantasy is intertwined with reality, leaving a deep space for reflection and a sad mood.Probably, in all cases, children with a rich imagination do not remember their childhood well. Games like representing ourselves as a superhero or a character endowed with superhuman abilities allowed us to feel somewhere inside a force aimed at helping to overcome simple life troubles - to ""surrender"" the abuser in school or to destroy something dear to the person you hate. But Conor's rich imagination allowed the Monster to be called in the form of an alive trunk of an ancient yew. However, the Monster does not appear to be the monster we meet in Hollywood movies, but a wise mentor sent from above to help overcome the boy's tragedy.This film is worth watching in complete solitude, alone with your thoughts and emotions. One of those rare examples in our days, when the hard heart and soul is to stay away from the ""Voice of the Monster"" with criticism of unnecessary dramatization of events. The film is full of sad but useful emotions and feelings that I want to experience to all those rare people with a sensitive soul who understand that nothing and no one in this world is forever."
" Any slower and the clichés would have frozen
",2017-11-11 00:00:00,3,"The classic mistake of parents who simply never learn to communicate. Particularly in preparing a child for death.I am sure that the book must be amazing. I am sure that the author poured himself into this story. But this movie is just woeful. Yes, the tree is sensational, the special effects and particularly the fables and the animation utterly fascinating and wonderful.But the actors are WOODEN... unbelievably so... so much that I couldn't care less who lived, who died, who did what... Not only did the boy want it to be over but I couldn't WAIT FOR THIS BORING MOVIE TO BE OVER.Again, I'm sure the book is good but this isn't. 3 stars for the terrific stuff that had no real people in it."
" Not easy to get into at first, but pays off by the end
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,9,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Conor (Lewis MacDougall) is a young man who's having bad luck fall down on him like heavy rain (as it literally does in most of the film.) He's being bullied at school, and his mother (Felicity Jones) is dying from cancer, leaving him in the care of his strict grandmother (Sigourney Weaver.) Alone and confused in the world, one day he gets the surprise of his life when a giant tree (Liam Neeson) comes to life, and tells him about three tales he needs to hear, which will come to have a bearing on how events pan out in his life. As an emotional thunderstorm braces his life, Conor's friendship with the tree takes a turn that will set them on a forever course.The first thing that irks you about J.A. Bayona's unique tale is how misleading the title is. A monster is a description of a bad, evil thing, which the multi-twigged centre-point of this film is hardly. The title sounds like your standard, generic horror film that usually winds up in the straight to DVD isle today. Alas, A Monster Calls is anything but generic. The characters, the set-up, the delivery, are all profoundly unique, and develop a film that emerges as an entirely different experience to anything you may have seen before.Initially, it's all a bit disconcerting, and doesn't set the most concrete ground to form the basis of a story on. As a result, it doesn't hold your attention much to start with, and it doesn't help that the tone is so caked in misery. from the grey, drained surroundings, in the bleak area the film is set in, constantly doused in falling rain. But somehow, if you stick with it, it develops into a film all of its own, and stirs a deep emotional chord in your heart that pays off marvellously in the end.Performances wise, Neeson is perfectly suited as the voice and mirror image of the tree, his deep, gravelly voice embodying the nature and presence of his character wonderfully, but the real revelation is MacDougall as the young boy, seething with pain and anger at his predicament and those around him, who is forced to confront his demons by this other-worldly creature. It's a match made in Heaven, and makes this something as close to a must see as there can be. ****"
" Simply 10 out of 10
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,10,An amazing story of how a boy copes with the terminal illness of a mother. It will resonate with anyone who has lost a parent and is presented in such a way that the feelings and emotions a child has at the most awful time are shown with compassion and truth. You are left with a feeling of completeness even if it does have a supernatural twist. Beautifully cast and acted and amazingly well directed with special effects which compliment everything. Probably a must watch film for everyone before and after a loved one is lost.
" Yew can do it
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,8,"I don't know who you would market this movie to. It's not a kid's movie, tho it tries very hard to look like one. It's not an adult movie (a boy and a talking tree), tho its themes certainly are mature. Both child and adult will squirm under the relentless emotional requirement with only a faint wisp of humor to lighten things up. Melancholy overload anyone? No? But if you make it to the end, you'll have received an unexpected cathartic cleansing and a life lesson in your pocket that is hard, but beautiful in its truth.Once you stop blubbering, that is."
" It's Harry Potter meets ET
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,7,"This movie when it first came out failed at the US box office yet made up its grosses worldwide and sold better on home media and on TV. That movie is A Monster Calls, a fantasy movie based on a book starring Liam Neeson as the voice of the main character, a tree monster created from the imagination of a young boy whose mother is dying from cancer. The ending of this movie is very sad."
" An underrated masterpiece
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,9,"I don't cry in movies. The last time I cried was with Goodwill hunting about a year ago. The first time I cried with a movie this year was watching this movie, which came to my surprise. It didn't particularly hit close to home or anything, but Jesus it was just so good. Before watching it I had never even heard about it, and I realized what an incredibly underrated movie this is. This should have been a monstrous box office hit, but very few people have watched it. I cannot recommend watching another movie more than this one if you haven't already watched it. Again, I don't cry in movies, and this isn't an exaggerated or overly dramatic attempt to make you cry. I don't like those movies, and I don't even cry with them. After watching this movie a few months back, looking back at 2016 this is probably one of my top 3 movies of all 2016, even tho I watched it a whole year later. Comes to show how underrated it was. Still, I am incredibly glad I watched it."

" Where to start?
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,9,"I, too, lost my mother to cancer. I was 45, but standing at her bedside as I said goodbye I may as well have been the same age as Connor. There is something amazing about this movie, that it uses a character positioned as a monster, who turns out to be a savior of sorts. A friend, a protector and a voice of calm reason to someone whose life is in turmoil.This boys life is near turned upside down. School is a hell, the father is absent and the Grandmother is a distant somewhat disconnected person to him. His life lacks any real comfort and he knows no safe harbor but his mother. And he is losing her.What he needs is to feel safe enough to confront what is facing him. The ""Monster"" finally shows him how to summon the strength needed to do this. Funny, but in the end the tree is his keeper and friend.The acting is superb, by all. Liam's voice work is a defining role for him. One need only hear his voice to picture his figure behind the voice. That is true art.The real monster in this move? Just as in life, that would be cancer.I know this monster. I know its' face. I know its' name."
" A very dramatic movie
",2017-09-08 00:00:00,8,"A lonely and bullied young boy who often loses himself in his thoughts, gets visited by a monster tree who wants to tell him three stories. Although unfaithful in the beginning, the boy realizes that the monster's visits might actually help him cope with his situation, especially now when his mother is the last stages of a terminal illness.It's a very dramatic story of a troubled boy who struggles to live his life, being surrounded by difficulties both at school and home. The imaginary monster seems to be exactly what he needs, although his presence affects the boy's behavior quite drastically. It's beautifully designed and animated using classy CGI which surprises you and kind of ups the slow rhythm that the movie has. It's interesting and captivating but very slow paced, a bit predictable and not very satisfying in the end. It's a good movie to watch, but beware of the tears which might come."
" stunning fantasy with a great big heart
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,10,"I was expecting yet another derivative monster-reveals-his-inner-beauty-to-disturbed-child melange, but I was surprised by a brilliant, tender piece of the filmmaker's art. This outstanding movie reveals a few days in the tortured life of Conor, an English lad whose mother is dying of terminal cancer. Conor is bullied by his classmates, misunderstood by his father (who lives in America), distanced--as if deliberately--by his grandmother, rather breezily portrayed by Sigourney Weaver, and appreciated only by the giant spirit of the yew tree, who visits in his dreams--or are they dreams? Through a series of semi-random vignettes and the monster's assortment of stories, Conor learns about good and evil, happiness and sadness, growth and stunting, reticence and forthrightness, and pretense and honor as he comes to grips with his young mother's rapidly worsening terminal cancer and his tortured relationship with his grandmother. There are some unexpected and quite improbable scenes and happenstances--as when Conor beats the faeces out of a bullying schoolmate--but the tale is generally straightforward (notwithstanding the twenty-foot walking tree monster, albeit), and we end up with a sensitively etched portrait of a vexed but talented young man facing the hard realities of growing up in an uncertain world. Five stars!!"

",2017-08-31 00:00:00,10,"REVIEW - A MONSTER CALLSFinally had the opportunity to watch this and....... Without giving too much away basically it's the story of how one boy deals with loss, fear, loneliness, the invertible and facing them with the help of a monster. 12.07!A British made film and one I'm glad was made here, I honestly don't think this could have worked as well set in the USA. If you have ever lost someone you have loved or if you know soon you will then this will be emotional but it will make you do one very important thing, it will make you tell that person you love them before you regret not having the time to do so.

" An alternate way to confront the reality.
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,7,"Based on the British novel, made by a well known Spanish director. This film might remind you the titles like 'Finding Neverland', 'Where the Wild Things Are', 'Neverwas' et cetera, but still it is unique. Particularly for the message it carried out. Many lines were awesome, inspiring for those whose world are crumbling down. Emotional, as well as one of the best recent children's films.The story of a boy whose mother is severely ill. He starts to have weird dreams, following, an appearance of a tree-monster from the nearby cemetery. The monster is to tell a few tales and at the end of it, he has to tell the truth about his nightmares to him. So as the days go by, it becomes more challenging to him to confront the reality. He can't run away from all, but to face it and those are the remaining narration.While being a kid, they believe every fantasy tale have narrated to them. Even a picture of those tales would influence to have an imagination in their daily life activity. This film does not hide anything from the viewers just to bring a breathtaking twist at the finale. So, you would know what's happening, but why, is the puzzle to solve. Even that is not a hard nut to crack. Though the purpose of the film is to reveal how some children cope a tragic event in their life, like perhaps the film 'Before I Wake', with misunderstanding the words said by the grown ups to them. This is really a wonderful film for kids, as well as for adults. I Hope you won't miss it.7/10"
" Such a Good Film
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,10,"Now I never cry at a film, until this film, it was really heartwarming really tingles with your emotions the acting by Lewis McDougall, Felicity Jones and Sigourney Weaver were stunning and of course Liam Neeson and Toby Kebell this was a brilliant, must watch film it should of won an Oscar it was that good, I would if I didn't cry at this film all the time watch it a million times it was so good. WATCH THIS FILM."
" A bit depressing! 6/10
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,6,"Review: What a, surprisingly, deep movie! I was expecting an upbeat, fantasy movie but it turned out to be slightly depressing but interesting at the same time. Anyway, Lewis MacDougall plays a young kid called Conor, who lives with his mum, played by Felicity Jones, who is suffering with cancer. Whilst being bullied at school, his grandma, played by Sigourney Weaver, tells him that he has to live with her, but he just wants to stay with his mum, who has to go through severe cancer treatment because everything that the doctors have tried, hasn't seemed to work. Conor then see's a magical Yew tree, Monster, who promises to tell him 3 stories, only if Conor tells him the fourth, so everyday at 12:07, the tree appears, even when Conor moves to his grandma's. When his dad comes over from America, he tells his Conor that he is unable to live with him, so Conor is forced to stay with his grandma, against his wishes. After the tree tells him the final story, Conor tells the tree his final story, and he finds out that his mum also saw the magical tree, which saved his life, and made him face his inner demons. Its quite a magical story, which does have some touching moments, but it's quite slow and there wasn't enough scenes with Conor and the tree. With that aside, the tree did look amazing, and Liam Neeson's voice was perfect for the role. Felicity Jones and Sigourney Weaver also put in emotional performances, along with the young Lewis MacDougall, who was talking to a green screen most of the time, so he had the toughest role of them all. Although I found the film to be touching, you do have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it, because you are left feeling quite glum when it's over. It's still worth a watch, mainly because of the tree, but the director could have installed some lighter issues to lighten the mood. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by J.A. Bayona, who also brought you the Orphanage in 2007, and the Impossible in 2012. He also directed a couple of episodes of Penny Dreadful, so he is obviously coming from a dark place, hence the way he made this movie. I always like seeing kids being kids, so it was hard to see Conor having to handle adult issues at such a young age. On top of everything that was happening at home, his school life was also hard for the young lad, so he really didn't have anywhere to turn. That's why the tree really was Conor's saviour, and I personally think it was the saviour of the movie. I also think that a lot of people was expecting more from the film, because it didn't smash the box office, as expected, but I didn't hear many negative reports about it.Budget: $43million Worldwide Gross: $46.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their fantasy/dramas, starring Lewis MacDougall, Sigourney Weaver, Felicity Jones, Toby Kebbell and the voice of Liam Neeson. 6/10"
" Brilliantly Impactful and Perfectly Balanced
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,10,"A Monster Calls follows a young boy whose mother is suffering from cancer and how he meets an imagined tree monster who teaches him how to cope via stories. For starters, every cast member kills it. Lewis MacDougall as the main character is outstanding. More often than not child actors don't work out, and even if they are good they have a few hiccups here and there. This kid didn't. Not once did I cringe at his acting abilities, nor did I ever not buy a single thing he said. He was fantastic. The supporting cast, including Toby Kebbell as the father, Sigourney Weaver as the grandma, Liam Neeson as The Monster, and especially Felicity Jones as the mother. Each one at first embodies what may seem like a clichéd character at first but very quickly and organically brings immense humanity to each role. One of my favorite aspects of the cast is how they are used. MacDougall fills the screen for most the entire run time, whereas the rest of the cast are supporting characters, but it never feels like any of them should've received more or less screen time. We got just enough time to introduce each character before humanizing them, and as a result it all flowed together so well. The directing is fairly good as well. J.A. Bayona knows his way around a camera, and while the movie very much feels like a mainstream Hollywood movie with a good budget, he still manages to add his own flair to the way he shoots it. The character of The Monster consumes a good chunk of screen time, and thankfully he looks fantastic, along with all the rest of the special effects. The way he moves and talks and interacts with the cast are all fluent, and not once did I disbelieve anything I was seeing on screen. Sure, it is obvious that The Monster is CGI, but it was never distracting, and I recall even audibly acknowledging how good the effects were as I was watching the movie. And furthermore, The Monster tells stories and there are almost always stylized animations to go along with it, and each are distinct and beautiful to look at. The writing is fantastic. The dialogue is very well written, and the way the story is carried by both the real life story and the stories told by The Monster are engaging to say the least. The characters are relatable and investing, and each one plays off of each other incredibly well. I'm not afraid to admit that I was crying a fair bit towards the last half as a result of these characters. Even characters who maybe hadn't received a whole lot of screen time made me cry, which shows just how well they were written in such a small amount of time. The last act in particular is fantastic. Certain scenes towards the end show that the movie doesn't hold any punches, that it's willing to get right to the point over censoring itself. And as I said earlier, it honestly made me cry. There were a few little things that I really appreciated about the movie as well, such as the name Lewis MacDougall being credited first at the beginning. So often mainstream movies advertise their biggest actors first, regardless of how small their roles are, and it's very refreshing to see a no-name child actor receive a credit first. Another thing was the sort of 'twist ending'. It's not really a twist, but there are two interpretations of it: a happier one and a darker one, and I appreciated that the movie was willing to present both those options to the audience, that the movie could actually be exploring something much different and more real than what the average audience member might pick up on. Overall A Monster Calls is outstanding. It's excellently performed, written, directed, and filled with top notch special effects and gut-punching emotional content. I absolutely loved every moment of this movie, and I can't wait to see it again. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie."
" A Monster Answers.
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,10,"In 2016,this film along with The Girl With All The Gifts and The Survivalist were the two main films that I wanted to see on the big screen, but was unable to find them being shown anywhere near me at a good time. Coming up to my 1,500th review,I decided it was the perfect time to finally call the monster.The plot:Whilst holding onto hope with his mum that she can win her battle with cancer,Conor has to take care of keeping the house tidy himself, (where he gets told off by grandma) and also finds the school bullies turning him into an ""invisible boy"" in school. One night Conor gets a visit from an old yew tree in the area which has turned into a Monster. Putting Conor in his hands,the Monster tells Conor that over the next few nights he will tell Conor three stories which he has to figure out the meaning behind. Agreeing to this,Conor is then told by the Monster that he himself must tell a fourth story, which will lead to Conor facing his greatest fear. View on the film:For her lone non-franchise role of 2016, Felicity Jones gives a brilliant, drained performance as the mum, whose frail grasp on life Jones uses in open body language to show the love she has for Conor keeps her fighting. Taking the roots of the film at only 14 years old, Lewis MacDougall gives an outstanding performance as Conor,with MacDougall giving Conor a mix of maturity in caring for his mum, and a burning ball of rage of being unable to improve the situation. Each entering as outsiders, Sigourney Weaver gives an earthy performance as Grandma, whilst Liam Neeson towers above the house in a performance deep with gravitas as the Monster.Completing the novel after author Siobhan Dowd died from breast cancer,the debut screenplay by Patrick Ness beautifully balances dark Fantasy with a heart-felt family Drama. Separating the encounters between Conor and the Monster into segments, Ness makes each story the Monster tells reveal aspects of Conor that he does not want to face. Respectfully treating mums battle with cancer,Ness avoids any drop of Melodrama to keep the struggle that the family are facing grounded,from the uncomfortable silences of Conor and his mum having difficult relationships with grandma and Conor's dad, (played by a very good Toby Kebbell) to Conor having to face his nightmare of seeing his mum get released from the pain.Painting the Monsters tales on the screen,director J.A. Bayona and cinematographer Oscar Faura take each tale off the page with richly macabre, Eastern European puppet-inspired animation, backed by an icy score from Fernando Velázquez. Continuing on themes shown in 2012's powerful The Impossible, Bayona seamlessly blends a stylised poetic quality with a dazzling emotional rawness, with the meetings between Conor and the Monster being covered in fading reds and browns. For his major theme of the torn family unit, Bayona elegantly uses extended takes and close-ups on half faces to capture the bond between Conor and his mum,as Conor learns the meanings of the monster calls."
" a gut-wrenching tale about death and grieving
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Don't be fooled: it may be labelled a fantasy but the content of A Monster Calls (2016) is brutally realistic. And ignore the trailer: it does not come remotely close to describing a story of the horrors inside a young boy's mind as he helplessly watches his mother deal with terminal illness. Too bleak for young audiences and mislabelled for those older, it is one of the most gut-wrenching films this writer has seen in a long while.There are two closely interwoven story lines at play: one is a magical fantasy, the other a tragic drama. Thirteen-year old Conor (Lewis MacDougall) is withdrawn and bullied at school as he experiences raging frustration over his mother's (Felicity Jones) worsening illness. Each time the hospital unsuccessfully tries a new treatment his hopes are dashed. He has fits of destruction and is desperate to understand what the grown-ups are keeping from him. He hates living with his strict grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) and his remarried father (Toby Kebbell) leaves him feeling even more abandoned. Nothing can break Conor's cycle of despair and time is running out. Drawing deep from his young sub-conscious memory, he reconstructs a monster story told long ago by his mother, one that empowers his desperate search for a happy ending. Her long-forgotten painting of a magic yew tree like the one outside his bedroom becomes his psychological crutch and he fantasises it as a powerful magical sage that can cure her illness. The tree comes to life with destructive menace to others but kindness towards Conor as it tries to teach acceptance of things that cannot be changed.The brilliance of this film lies in the way that story unfolds not just from Conor's point of view but from deep inside his turbulent mind. Conventional cinematography and narrative structures position us where the director wants us, but this film goes much further. Through the sincerity and emotive power of the amazing young Lewis MacDougall, we viscerally feel what he is feeling. While we see magical happenings on screen, the role of monster and magic in this narrative is entirely cathartic. Some viewers may need a degree of forgiveness for the unimaginative CGI tree monster and its magical doings. The sinewy hyper-masculine beast with flashing lights from every crevice might startle ten-year olds but it is a tame cliché for older viewers. Some of its dialogue sounds preachy like ""heroes don't always win"" and its make-believe destructiveness can be repetitive. But these are minor distractions compared to the emotional punch this film can deliver.Conversations about death and grief are difficult at any age. From the outset, the film's narrator explains that Conor is somewhere between boy and man. By the end of his sad journey, he has grown emotionally and learnt about letting go. Much more than just entertainment, this sensitive coming of age tale is an honest conversation about some of the most complex feelings a human can ever experience."
" I know everything you want to say without you saying it out loud
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,8,"Connor (Lewis MacDougall) has it rough. Bullied at school, living with a single mom (Felicity Jones) dying from cancer. Connor is visited by a monster Treebeard-Groot who tells him stories in order to help Connor cope. The bottom line is life and people are complex, not all good or bad. This sets you up for that same warm and fuzzy feeling you had when Old Yeller died.This is a well done story, good original plot line, and great acting. Interesting side note Liam Neeson did both the voice of the monster and the Lion in Narnia, by C,S. Lewis. Lewis inspired the voice for Treebeard and the monster was a tree type monster. Okay, maybe it wasn't that interesting to you.The emotional ride is fairly intense. I am not sure if younger kids should see it. I am in my sixties and still have nightmares about Old Yeller."
" Well ... it mostly works ...
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,8,"A boy whose mother is dying is visited by a giant tree monster that tells him stories to help him come to grips with his devastating grief. I can see why folks would love this ... I don't quite love it. A closest point of comparison would be ""Pan's Labyrinth"". Like that film, this blends a fantasy-based magical realism with serious adult themes. I think it succeeds at the former, and comes close with the latter. It creates an amazing world, but leans too heavily on heavy emotional sentiment to somewhat disguise the fact that it doesn't really have a whole lot to say beyond fairly obvious platitudes."
" Emotionally ravaged
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,9,"I had the strangest experience watching this movie...i was in a quiet theater, maybe 25 people total, all sitting behind me. After the movie finished I sat for a full 5 minutes emotionally rocked of what I had just witnessed. I got up from my seat to leave and realized I was the first person leaving the theater....I looked around me and people were either crying or like myself stony faced.....it was so powerful it was hard to describe. Personally I think it is totally unsuitable movie for children of any age, they will be bored, not understand, or overwhelmed.I really can't emphasize enough how emotionally powerful this movie is."
" One of the worst movies ever
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,1,"Total nonsense, the story line is too long and everyone watching with me wished movie will get over somehow. How can someone make such illogically sad movie. I hope everyone related to this crap gets suffered for torturing the viewers for 2 long and agonizing hours. Most folks not only hates such cancer movies, this one is especially bad and its moral is to accept the truth and let your loved ones dies quickly of any fatal disease as there is nothing you can do to help them and its not your fault."
" A superb chiller
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,8,"A Monster Calls is a movie from a screenplay by Class creator Patrick Ness and based on his novel of the same name. A Monster Calls had its world premiere at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival on September 10 2016. For Australian moviegoers it has taken almost a year to reach here in Australia as it just got released in cinemas on July 27 2017. The wait I think is worth it. The movie is carried mainly by Lewis MacDougall as young boy Conor O'Malley. The adult principal cast is made up of Sigourney Weaver, Felicity Jones, Toby Kebbell and Liam Neeson as the Monster. A Monster Calls is a very moving movie and the stories that got presented here reflects well on the experience that Conor is having here. Lewis MacDougall is very good as young Conor displaying the difficulties he is having with his current situation. The difficulties being his terminally ill mother and being bullied at school all at the same time encountering the monster."
" Just... too much real
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,10,"I lost my mother this year for cancer. I feel like a sh*t. This movie can do to you a new perspective. It's just too much real. Like a therapy free for understand. If you lose your mother by cancer, you understand this movie like me.Prepare for cry."
" Beautiful animations in a good but sad movie
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,8,"A fantasy drama, not really the genre I would go for normally. But I have to admit I was impressed, positively impressed. It's a beautiful story, not a joyful movie but a sad movie. Nevertheless being a sad movie you get captivated by the story from the beginning till the end. The young Lewis MacDougall could not have done better playing his character. The whole cast was perfectly chosen for their respective characters. Even Liam Neeson that is just the narrating voice of The Monster was the perfect fit for that part. His narrating voice and tones are to me one of the better things about A Monster Calls. But also the animation during the told stories, they are just sublime to watch. It all brings the movie to a higher level. I will watch this movie again in the future, knowing well that even if I will be prepared this time I will still have sad moments."
" Great Movie. Better ending.
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,10,"This movie in unbelievably beautiful. A little slow at the beginning (first 30 minutes) but if you can past that you will not regret. It will be all about a boy trying to fight his deepest fears. Well, that is what i thought until the very last scene. Then, what so far was good, became GREAT. Last scene explain it all and till now makes me thing about some life values. (Have some tissues with you)"
" a child's experience
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,8,"""A Monster Calls"" reminded me of ""Pan's Labyrinth"", with the surreal atmosphere and story of a child's fantasies. The focus in this case is a boy whose mother has terminal cancer. He gets visited by the Monster, a yew tree that has a number of stories. But eventually it will come time for the boy to tell a story.The Monster is naturally an intense character. Don't get me wrong; he has a purpose, and lots of good things to say. But I would say that an equally intense character is the boy's grandmother. Stern and emotionally distant, she gives the boy as much incentive to imagine the Monster as does the school bully.It's an impressive movie. What I liked best was the Monster's stories (one focusing on a prince, another on an apothecary). But in the end, the movie is about letting go. And there are some fine performances. In the lead of course are Lewis MacDougall as the boy and Liam Neeson as the Monster, but strong support comes from Felicity Jones as the mother and Sigourney Weaver as the grandmother (Charlie Chaplin's daughter Geraldine also appears, having previously appeared in Bayona's 2007 movie ""The Orphanage""). I understand that Bayona is currently making the fifth movie in the ""Jurassic Park"" series."
" ""Let me tell you a tale of when I came walking.""
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,10,"I hardly even know where to begin describing this film. It's emotionally riveting and a profoundly sad experience at the same time, a picture I wouldn't consider suitable for very young kids, even though the main protagonist, Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) is only twelve years old himself. The 'Monster' in the story, voiced by Liam Neeson, arrives at moments of extreme stress in young Conor's life, with a series of three tales that tend more to confuse and obfuscate, rather than offer clarity to Conor's fear of losing his mother (Felicity Jones) to a deadly cancer. Compelled to relate a true story of his own back to The Monster, Conor is forced to deal with the truth of his situation. The story is one of hanging on and letting go at the same time, and is not an easy kind of movie to sit through. Not because of it's pacing or structure, but just because it's so heart rending in the way it deals with Conor's grief and anger. Not everyone will find the picture worthwhile, those who manage to stick with it will experience a sublime truth in trusting one's feelings in the face of tragedy and knowing they are real, even if painful. For the particularly sensitive, keep a box of Kleenex handy."
" A box office bomb that deserves an audience
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,6,"At one stage or another it seemed as though A Monster Calls was set to become one of 2016's breakout hits.Positive reception from initial trailers through to a fair portion of glowing reviews, once The Orphanage and The Impossible director J.A Bayona's film hit the public spectrum it only but enhanced this adaptation of Patrick Ness's novel of the same name chances of becoming a hit with a wide audience and even perhaps a hit with Academy voters.Fast forward to now and A Monster Calls can officially be described as a box office dud that failed to make it into cinemas in Australia until now whilst barely making a dent in the box office overseas where it was largely forgotten about in the X-mas rush, despite a critical rating of over 80% on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes.A hard sell in many ways and an awkwardly targeted film, this is a movie that's themes will go over many younger audience members heads and is perhaps too ""fantasy"" driven for some older audiences, Bayona's visually arresting and sometime emotionally resonate film is a film that often feels torn between being too many things and while it's hard not to appreciate elements of this unique take on the cancer drama sub-genre, you almost wish it had become more of master of one than a hodgepodge of too many ideas.One thing that is mightily evident outside of Bayona and his teams impressive visual feats, especially when talking about Neeson's CGI creation of the tree like Monster, is Bayona's continued solid work with his performers and after drawing out such memorable turns from his young cast members in The Orphanage and The Impossible, its quite clear the director is a skilled developer of young actors.Here led by Lewis MacDougall as young boy Conor who is struggling to cope with his mother's (played impressively by Felicity Jones) life threatening cancer, Bayona extracts a memorable turn from the young performer who has to do a large amount of the films heavy lifting. While the film may struggle in ways to connect us at all times to its hybrid of metaphorical monsters, storytelling and dramatic family conundrums, the efforts of those involved here can't be faulted.Final say – Elevated by a unique visual tone, memorable acting turns and some spot on voice work by Neeson, A Monster Calls is a solid film but one that could've been so much more.If we look back but a few months, that talk about this film becoming a true classic seemed to be legitimately on point but this final product leaves one with a feeling of being let down even though emotions for some may run deep as the runtime draws its closing periods.Still, Bayona is a director to get excited about and his upcoming sequel to Jurassic World should likely be quite the thrill ride.3 destroyed lounge rooms out of 5"
" dark brooding tale
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,7,"Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) is a scrawny English school boy. His mother (Felicity Jones) is terribly ill. He is getting bullied in school. As his mother deteriorates, he is cared for by his grandmother (Sigourney Weaver). His absent father (Toby Kebbell) returns from working in America. When the clock strikes 12:07, a monster visits to tell him tales.It's dark tale. MacDougall's sunken eyes perfectly fit the mood. The visually are effectively stunning. The drawback is that it's imaginary. The monster is causing damage like Gozilla but none of it is real. The boy does do damage himself which is compelling. In some ways, the monster is a distraction. I imagine a different kind of monster which is more horror than action would add to the intensity."
" Great Movie, but be careful of younger children watching.
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,8,"I found this movie excellent but a warning to parents, my fault but I had not researched this film at all before watching with my 7 year old son, and even though he really enjoyed the movie it was his first realization of what death really meant and got quite upset by the end of the movie.But in saying that our dog recently needed to be put to sleep and because of this movie I think it helped him say goodbye and get him prepared for what was happening."
" Nearly unwatchable.

It's slow. It's transparent from start to finish. The plot is uninteresting and there is no suspense, there are no good characters, the plot is nearly nonexistent, and the movie inspires no interest in the audience.It wants to tug at your heartstrings so badly that it strains from the effort and falls flat on its face. It then proceeds to ramble on for two hours about nothing particularly specific or even novel while doing it's best to ensure you don't accidentally forget that you should totally be sad and immersed.I give this poop out of five stars. I want my rating to be a poop emoji and I don't even like emojis."
" A beautiful story; don't listen to the naysayers
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,10,"I've been afraid of the film industry going down the toilet for years. It seems like genuinely heartfelt and deep stories are being replaced more often each year by bad remakes, crass ""comedy"" and Disney rubbish. I was thrilled to see that the amazingly poignant novel 'A Monster Calls' was being adapted into a film, and really surprised by not only the amount of work that went into it, but also the way in which it displays the reality of grief. All too often films suggest that people in grief should start popping antidepressants and sweeping the memory of their loved ones under the rug as though they never existed. This film, on the other hand, gives us the truth, a truth sometimes ugly and other times beautiful.It's a little of 'Skelig' (2009) and 'Paperhouse' (1988); I would describe it as being a sort of psychological fantasy tale, aesthetically amazing with its not-so-menacing monster and magnificent animated interludes, but what really got to me was how, instead of wallowing in sadness, Conor was able to reconnect with his crabby but well-meaning grandmother, say goodbye to his mother and learn from her gifts, admit to his deadbeat father that he's tired of being ""that other son of mine"" and cope with bullying. Despite what many other viewers have said, this is not a depressing or useless story in the least. I completely understand how it may be upsetting to viewers who've lost a family member to cancer; I lost my grandmother recently to lung cancer and I will concede that it's not the right film for everyone, but this is so much more than just some creepy death story or morbid grim reaper type thing. It's hard to describe, but at the risk of sounding too pretentious, I'll say that it looks at the heavy topic of bereavement through a more romantic lens, reminiscent of films in a more 20th Century style. Its stunning British scenery helps a lot too in setting not only the mood, but the old style myths and legends that go along with Conor's lessons from the monster himself.One thing I'll caution about viewing this film - it's a film that most definitely might bother some younger viewers, and despite its target age being kids, it deals with some very grown-up subjects. That being said, it's not only entertaining, but a good way to teach younger viewers about letting go and about appreciating your loved ones, both the departed, and those still left on earth. 'A Monster Calls' might be dark at times but it's excellent nonetheless, and by passing it up, you'd miss so much dedicated work and obvious love that's been poured into every fibre of this weird but wonderful story."
" A truly fantastic ride
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,6,"""A Monster Calls"" is a Spanish/American/British co-production from 2016 that results in an English-language movie and boy has this one been successful with the awards circuits. It runs for 105 minutes approximately and was directed by J.A. Bayona, thus the Spain reference. The screenplay writer is Patrick Ness and he is also the one who came up with the original novel here. Looking at the awards, the IMDb rating and the RT reception, you can certainly say that he did a good job overall. Lead actor Lewis MacDougall is probably not too famous (yet?), but Weaver, Jones and Neeson (all Oscar nominees) are of course household names by now. And they are all giving strong performances too. Weaver and Jones add a lot of heart to the story while Neeson gives one of the more memorable voice acting performance in recent history.This is the story of a teenager who not only has to deal with bullying at school, but also needs to come to terms with his mother's mortality. And he finds a strong companion not necessarily in easing his pain, but in directing it properly. The consequence is also that the moments when he says he wants it to be over and when they are at the mother's bed are really touching and got my eyes wet. Sadly, these moments alone are not enough to really appreciate everything before that. There are always minor flaws in terms of storytelling, nothing too serious, but enough to make a difference for the negative side in terms of the quantity. For example the third story was really really weak compared to stories one and especially two. The protagonist standing up to the bullies added nothing to the film in my opinion. And actually it also did not feel too authentic. And there are other flaws too, like the part with the dad is not really a worthy addition because it does not add anything in terms of character development other than perhaps showing the protagonist is far from alone, but Weaver (and Jones) provide that to a sufficient degree too.Nonetheless, the weaknesses in storytelling are somewhat made up by the strengths in performances, even if I did not like the lead actor as much as some of the others I guess. This is certainly one of the most depressing 2016/2017 films, probably not one of the best, but still fairly good. It could have needed some more cutting though, maybe should have stayed at 90-95 minutes max and it would have been a really strong film if they had left out the right (i.e. wrong) scenes. I still recommend it though, just not that enthusiastically."
" It's not bad
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,5,"It's not a bad movie. I thought it would be better, but for me, it's a predictable plot technique where someone is having an issue and works thru the issue thru a psychological manifestation to deal with it. In this case the boy creates a tree monster in his head to talk to as a ""3rd party"" to resolve his problems. It's in a way almost like one of those ""it was all a dream"" kind of plots, or should I say ploy. But it's not a bad movie which is why I gave it a so-so rating."
" Spoiler Free Review: A Monster Calls
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,10,"J.A. Bayona has a pretty great gift. He knows how to get Oscar worthy performances out of CHILD ACTORS! After 'The Inpossible' I was very excited to see what Bayona would do next. What he has done with A Monster Calls, is create one of the smartest, most thought provoking children's film I have ever seen. Easily my favorite film of the year so far, It was a movie that I really could relate to. I'm going to get into that but if you're someone who has ever gone through tough times and you don't know how to get your feelings out because no one will ever be able to comprehend what you're going through, this films the one for you. Lewis Macdougall gives the best child actor performance I've seen probably since I saw Taxi Driver for the first time with Jodie Foster. Really everyone in the film is fantastic. Felicity Jones, Sigourny Weaver, Toby Kebbell and every one else did a great job. I would like to take a moment to really talk about how great Liam Neeson is in this film, with no screen time physically. All he does is voice work for the monster and he is one of the most fatherly and wise characters I've seen in a long time. The Monster was maybe my favorite part of the movie right being Macdougall's performance as a very hurt young boy. J.A. Bayona's vision for this film is amazing. He proves, again, that he knows what he's doing behind the camera and is one of the best at what he does. And in the end...PROS: Acting, Directing, CinematographyCONS: NoneA Monster Calls is a film you should check out as soon as you get the chance.

" A compelling study of a young boy facing grief
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,7,"The idea of a protagonist delving head-first into a realm of fantasy to escape the traumas of the real world is one that is employed by film-makers frequently, enabling them to inject an independent spirit into what could appear to some as a big-budget crowd-pleaser. Although these kinds of movies seem to pop up every year, the fantasy angle remains an incredibly effective tool, and occasionally a bona fide masterpiece will emerge such as Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth (2006). While del Toro's film saw its central character enter the titular labyrinth to escape a fascistic stepfather and the horrors of the Spanish Civil War, J.A. Bayona's A Monster Calls, based on the novel of the same name by Patrick Ness, sets its focus on a more personal and relatable tragedy. Young Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) is struggling to deal with bullies, a strict grandmother and his mother's terminal cancer.His young mother, played with incredible warmth by Felicity Jones, spends most of her time in bed as her body becomes exhausted from multiple hospital treatments. Conor watches her become weaker and weaker as his grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) tends to her, and spends his hours in school terrified of bully Harry (James Melville). Struggling to sleep, he spends most of his nights drawing, finding refuge in his art. One night, he watches as the yew tree on the hill in the distance grows limbs and pulls itself from the ground, bounding towards Conor's bedroom window with fiery eyes. Voiced by a gravelly Liam Neeson, the Monster promises to tell Conor three stories, and insists that the boy tell him the fourth in return. The stories, which tell of good people doing bad things and bad people doing good things, seem nonsensical to Conor, but he gradually learns of the complexity of being human and dealing with grief and trauma.With a reported budget of only $43 million, the special effects are incredibly effective in bringing the monster to life. He is not your usual kid's cuddly best friend, but an intimidating mass of branches and roots with a fondness for demolition who takes out most of Conor's bedroom when we first meet him. Yet spectacle is the last thing on Bayona's mind. The film's title and trailer may suggest a film to take your kids too, but A Monster Calls is a grounded and subdued drama similar to Bayona's breakthrough, the elegant and genuinely scary horror film The Orphanage (2007). While the emotional moments tread familiar ground and with this comes a sense of manipulation, there is a honesty to the performances, especially by the sad-eyed MacDougall, that help make this a lip-quivering experience. It didn't receive much attention during awards season and will no doubt pass most people by, but A Monster Calls is compelling study of a young boy struggling to understand his feelings and the events going on in the grown-up world around him."

But the boy has a wise mother and paradoxically she is the one who encourages him not fear these monsters in life but to ride on them...I heard people say it's a sad movie, because we want monsters to be bad. But when you look at Connors Mom, you must say it's a strong movie. This lesson here might help you to deal with your own monsters and it will help you to understand your fears. That's why I recommend this movie to anyone, because the fear is out there, that's the truth. Soonor or later, it will find you, because you can't hide. And here comes the good part: You don't even have to hide."
" Humans Are Complicated Beasts
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,8,"I watched this Deutsch dubbed so I don't have a lot to say about Liam Neeson's involvement -- only that The Monster was my least favorite part of the movie. Didn't feel convincing, and just didn't hold the film together for me. They could've ditched unnecessary rationalizing is all I'm saying, 'cos The Monster and his stories' design/attitude fit well with the the film otherwise.Conor was the high point for me. Could've kicked it up a notch but, still, I adored that he was characteristically dark as opposed to being dark just 'cos he's in grief. This little detail carries the entire tone of the movie for me, and made the Dark Fantasy element appropriate. One other thing I adored was that he was portrayed with maturity, a trait too often dismissed in children. The character interactions were hard to predict as a result, and so were his own reactions toward the plot and the conflicts it brought up. And I imagine kids who watch this will appreciate that Conor is depicted as an Actual Person instead of Just A Child. Might just be that I watched this during a flight but very little of the shots and the score remain with me. This story isn't a new one either, and neither is its premise particularly novel. I'm convinced this film is aware of that, though, choosing to maximize on elements you least expect. As someone who also lost a parent at an early age, I can vouch that it captures the complexities of the experience. It tackles the part of grief you don't often see, like dissociation, aggression, and guilt, and the importance of accepting, understanding and confronting these feelings."
" Moving journey with a very big friend
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,9,"I was pleasantly surprised as this wonderful movie unfolded, with wonderful characters, and some outstanding water color animation. Very thought provoking with lessons to learn for young and old. This young boy personifies so many experiences that viewers can relate to throughout the film. I am totally bewildered that there are some 1-3 star reviews here - I literally can't believe it. Very moving - I could, and will watch it again in the future."
" Brilliant.
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,9,"Do not get fooled by the title. DO not get fooled by the trailer. Do not get fooled by the poster. This is a brilliant movie. Simply brilliant. About life. The boy's play is just magical. Jones and Weaver are just, well, as always, brilliant actors. For me, its a must see movie and maybe one of the best I have seen in 2017."
" Bad movie.
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,1,"Absoute torture! Very very slow. Sad and depressing. I don't know how this movie has such good reviews. It one of those movies that tries to be intelligent but is absolutely a bad one. Good animation though. Don't waste the two hours in your life, especially if its a weekend. Bad acting. Bad story."
" Impressive acting from a visionary director!!!
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,7,"A Monster Calls is visionary when it comes to visual effects, and storytelling on relatable themes in a coming of age tale. It is a strong emotional film to watch about a young boy at a coming of age and struggling to deal with his terminally ill mother. Cancer and diseases suck and when it is happening with someone you know or a family member. It can be difficult as you see their condition and how it affects them. J.A. Bayona's film does go over those dark themes about it. The film follows Conor (Lewis MacDougall) a young boy living with his mother Lizzie (Felicity Jones) who is struggling with a terminal illness. After the attempt of a final resort treatment does not work. Conor is a talented artistic kid, his father (Toby Kebbell) who is living with another woman and has his own family in Los Angeles. He comes by to pay his respect and support for Lizzie and Conor. Conor being neglected on going home with him. He is forced to stay with his grandmother (Sigourney Weaver). When Conor's life feels like it is out of control, he encounters a tree like monster, that will tell him three stories with a specific theme. In return, Conor has to say his story in the end. What I liked about A Monster Calls is J.A. Bayona's direction. It captures the tone of a growing boy, feeling like he is losing everything and hopelessness. He gets bullied for no reason at all. He is not close with his grandmother, who is controlling. His request to stay with his father is denied when his family does not have room for him. With the monster coming to him and telling him stories that may guide him in the right direction is pretty neat. Also, the plot is difficult to watch with its theme of family member having an illness. It does have its emotional strong ending about how much we try not to let go. Felicity Jones was remarkable with her performance, seeing how physically the illness is affecting her and emotionally. Sigourney Weaver was at her best. Toby Kebbell was decent with his brief role. Liam Neeson voicing the monster was a perfect choice. And Lewis MacDougall performance was great. What I did not like about the film is its overuse with the visual animation. When the monster tells its three stories and has the animation show it. It just took away from its serious matter on the plot. I also thought the film could have used a more powerful music score that could build the emotions. Overall, A Monster Calls is a fairly done dark fantasy film that focuses on serious drama and themes, even though some impressive visual effects does become a distraction."
" Don't waste your time
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,1,"What an awful kids movie! Sigorney and Liam must of been hurting for cash. The English still can't make movies much less kids movies. Paddington Bear, Thomas the train and whatever they thought was good. Junk junk junk""Participation trophy"". NOT!"
" Tragic and Touching
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,9,"Conor (Lewis MacDougall) is an angry boy and he has every right to be. He is bullied at school, he cares for his Mother (Felicity Jones) who has cancer, and his father (Toby Kebbell) is divorced from his mother and he lives in the US in California. Enter the grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) who has come to help her daughter. She tells Conor that he will come to live with her and Conor is against that. Conor keeps hoping that the next new medicine will work and heal his mother. Knowing all the above we see Conor as being very much alone, and scared. Enter the Monster (Liam Neeson). Conor is not afraid of him. Conor thinks the Monster is there to help his mother. He tells Conor 3-stories with a proviso that Conor must tell him the 4th story. And the 4th story must be the absolute truth about Conor himself. Now Conor is more than confused. We will see how Conor deals with his loneliness, bullies at school, his invisibility at school, his caring about his sick mother , his anger, and his loss. Conor's mother had a very good drawing ability and that ability transferred to Conor. Now you may think that his drawing the Monster caused the Monster to appear. HmmmLiam Neeson as the Monster was very good, of course, but his voice was a little too heavy and one had to listen carefully to catch all of his dialogues. Lewis MacDougall as Conor will be a rising star as he just acted in his second movie, but carried it off like a seasoned professional. Kudos. Sigourney Weaver is a seasoned professional and she was spot on as usual. The scenes with Conor and his mother (Felicity Jones) - at times - will have you reaching for that box of Kleenex you should have brought in with you to watch the movie. In later scenes with Conor as she knows the end is near and later on her deathbed, you will really need that Kleenex box. She will get to you. In one of her last scenes you see that she, too, sees the Monster behind Conor. I hope she gets an Oscar. The CGI was exceptionally good.Conor goes to his new room and opens his mother's drawing book and he sees drawings of the characters the Monster told about in his stories; and the last drawing was of the Monster. Hmmmm... (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."
" A Director's Monster(Heavy Spoiler)
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"Once upon a time, there was a story. The story tells a tale about a young boy and a tree. Surely most people have noticed that the story is not really about that, when a ""monster"" calls, it is not the tree that calls the boy, it is not the boy who calls the tree. It's the monster within the boy, the boy, is the ""monster"". Because of his mother's illness, the boy constantly lives in fear, the fear of losing his mother, of being alone, of getting ignored, just because people only feel sorry for him. I'm sure most of you got the part of the tree being a metaphor and all, so I'll spend less time on that. The tree forces him to face his truth, and the truth is that he just want it to all be over, and because the truth is so ""evil"" it tortures him, every night, in his dreams, he could never hold on to his mother. Blah, blah, blah OK, now that we got that out of the way. Let's talk about some things that maybe not everyone have noticed, also why this movie impressed me so much: First thing, structure. The structure of the movie was pieced together just perfect enough for us to understand things as we go, not too much, not too little. The film begins with his dream, his nightmare. Might be just a little cheesy. But it is perfect for us to understand his fear, also when the tree makes his first appearance, we can refer to that as the ""nightmare"" that he mentions. The morning after he smashes the house, his father making noise down stairs is perfect for dragging the audiences' nerve with him, because we are with him on thinking its grandma he has to face. We have all been there, being a kid who did something wrong, waiting for the punishment. The room upstairs was always locked, and every time he looks through the keyhole, we never actually see what's in that room until the end. Second thing, details. Some of the things I mentioned in the first part are also considered details, but there's more. I watched the first half twice, because I watched it half way and realized what a great movie it is so I paused it and downloaded a subtitle to watch it with my mum(She doesn't speak English). There's a reason I mention this, because the second time watching it, I noticed a lot more things. First time we see the classroom he sits in, in the background, on the blackboard, out of focus, drawn with chock is a mother's womb with a baby in there (I'm sure you know why). The second time we are in the classroom, right after the first tale about good and evil, in the background the teacher says, ""Now there are always two sides to a story"" This, thanks to having downloaded the subtitle for my mum, I noticed, because the voice was so low that I wouldn't have heard what exactly she was saying if wasn't for the thoughtful subtitle. Third time in the classroom, time for the exam, its also time for the third tale, time to test ""what you have learned from the last two weeks""(last two tales). Fourth time in the classroom, right after he released himself, the teacher is talking about emotional well being, ""how good it feels when you finally find the courage to say it."" this is also when he has to face his fear, and say his truth. Honestly the production design is also brilliant, I can't list out all the things for you, but if you watch it again, you might notice, especially in the classroom, everything on the wall helps telling the story. There are a lot more than what I have mentioned here. Third thing, animation. I loved the animation style used in the movie, they chose to use watercolor, like us humans, we were born in water, made of water. The soft touch of the paintings is like the boy's tears dripping inside, just like the tree he drew. The transitions in the animation is what impressed me the most, spider becomes witch's hand, tree's arm becomes a bridge, the priest smashes the book down and turn into riding a horse cart. That's just beautiful for me. Also when he comes home, from behind the glass door, he looks just like the characters in the watercolor. Finally, the best part. Yes of course I left the best part to the end, and yes of course there is a best part - Liam Neeson! At the beginning title, I did notice his name appearing in the credit, but half way through the movie, I almost forgot about it. Until I saw the pictures on the table in grandma's house. Wait, that's Liam Neeson in the picture holding a little girl(the boy's mum). Then I started wondering. OK if he only plays a few pictures in the background in the movie, how come he is in the beginning credit, when they only list main casts. Unless I went to the film's IMDb page, and just as a suspected. He plays the tree in the film. This might be a joke to some people because I'm sure many of you were able to recognize his voice right when you heard it, but unfortunately I am not familiar with it enough to be sure about it until I checked the credit. Anyway, basically what I'm saying is that the tree and the grandpa who was never shown in the film are played by the same person. And if you had any question about how does his mother see the same tree monster as he does, and why she drew the tree too in her drawing pad. That is your answer, because the tree is her father.Thanks for reading, I'll see you next time. Star Li www.astarlifilm.com"
" Visually great, but lacking a proper storyline...
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,4,"I wasn't particularly hyped up or excited about ""A Monster Calls"". Why? Well, because I didn't even know about it prior to seeing the poster on the wall at the local cinema. Then again, I am not actively a fan of anyone in the movie.But still, the movie poster looked good and I read up on the synopsis for the movie, which also did prove to sound promising. So I sat down and watched ""A Monster Calls"".First and foremost I must say that the CGI used in ""A Monster Calls"" was downright impressive. Lots of amazing detail and it was just a pure work of art to watch it come to life on the screen. So you might as well be prepared to be blown away by the visuals here.And with that said, I must flip the coin and state that the storyline told in ""A Monster Calls"" was awkwardly devoid of anything even remotely compelling or interesting, and that resulted in a less than mediocre movie experience, because the visuals could only do so much for the movie.They had also managed to put together a great ensemble of cast for the voice work for the various roles and characters in the movie. And I will be the first to admit that it was because of Sigourney Weaver and Liam Neeson that I jumped at the chance to watch ""A Monster Calls"".However, as the movie ended, I was not even mildly impressed with the movie experience as a whole. Sure, it had been a visual treat to look at and I was taken aback with the level of details in every scene. But the storyline just was too slow paced and didn't have much to offer to keep me interested.As such then ""A Monster Calls"" hardly impressed and it is not an animated movie that I will be returning to for watching a second time."
" A monster calls captivated not - but it's not bad
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,6,"I missed this in theaters. When I discovered it recently, I got great expectations after reading the other reviews here. So what I think even after having seen it? In fact, I find it difficult to write a review, because I can not quite make up my mind. It is a mixture of a social drama, a bit of horror, something fairy tale. I think the film struggling a bit to get your message across his as well, although it is evident in the end. I think the film diverge a bit much in several directions. It is certainly the point. Of those who play in the one I was most impressed by Sigourney Weaver. So versatile she is, and fun to watch her succeed in such movies as well. But Iam surprised over the very high rating here. Overall, I think this was okay, but nothing more."
" Surprisingly great
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,10,"I didn't know much about this one, only saw trailer in the movies, but it grabbed my attention. As it turned out, it's a stunningly beautiful masterpiece, both visually and emotionally. The film revolves around the topics of loss, grief and self-knowledge with a very compelling allegory. As much as it's visual approach is dazzling, the emotional side might be difficult to process for some people. But don't be afraid. I'll be right here."
" This movie is one of the best I've seen so I could say that it's my favorite movie.
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,10,"The truth is that when I first was talked about that movie I thought that I would not like it because I hate movies that tears me away. But, my opinion drastically changed when I first saw 'A Monster Calls' at the cinema, I was pleasantly surprised, I felt like I was inside the movie and I was really close to the main characters and I think that's the best sensation anyone can feel with any movie. The movie analyses how an almost teenager feels when he is alone basically because he is bullied, his mother has a terminal disease and his parents are divorced. He has to deal with the illness of her mother and take care of her when he was suffering because he is being mistreated at school. This topics made me thought about what is really important to complain about and what it's not from the point of view off all the people that could be in this situation. What I like the most of this film is the end because you finally understand what the monster is and why it is there. I don't have any criticism because the effects, the story and in general all the movie is fantastic, it is really a must-see movie, so I recommend it to all of you."
" Not worth it.
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,4,"I expected this movie to be completely different. The actions of the characters (especially the boy & the monster) don't make sense most of the time. I struggle to find a use of that monster, seriously, this movie could have been completely fine without this monster. His presence did not make much of an effect in my opinion. Other than that, the movie had stunning visual effects and beautiful cinematography; the artists/photographers definitely did an awesome work. However, the plot and dialogue just don't fit in..."
" Fantasy meets reality
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,10,"Fantasy meets reality. Such a heartbreaking, puzzling yet inspirational and unpredictably moving story. How can someone go through a lot of things in life at a very young age? You can only imagine how hard things are for him. Being bullied at school for being different is not right, not in any way possible. Losing something very important to you will lead you to frustration but losing a mother or any of your loved ones and accepting that it's the reality of life is not easy. You'll have to fight it, everything, you'll have to find ways not to accept that life is going to an end. You cant even think or know how could you possibly move on from something that is very devastating. You cannot dare yourself not to cry, such a tearjerker."
" grossly underrated and underpromoted!
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,10,"I really wanted to see this film in the cinema to get the full scope but sadly did not get the chance. i finally got the chance to see this wonderful film today, and it was incredible. this was a true coming of age story with a realistic problem, not like those trivial 'nobody likes me' teenage films. The way the main character has to grow up so quickly to deal with his mother's cancer is heartbreaking and as a disabled person myself, the way he loses himself in fantasy is something i can relate to. The film was visually stunning! although one question (spoiler ahead) did anyone feel like every time 'the monster' told a story, it felt like a scene from 'harry potter and the deathly hallows'? LOL anyway, fabulous performances from Felicity Jones (duh) Sigourney Weaver (double duh) and a wonderful newcomer Lewis McDougall. It's no secret it's an emotional film but one definitely worth watching!"
" It might be as good as people told me
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,9,"The movie I have seen is 'A monster calls'. It was perform for the first time the October 6th of 2016 in Spain and was directed by Juan Antonio Bayona. Lewis McDougall plays the role of the main character, Conor O'Malley, an eight-year-old boy who lives in his own world and that is bullied in the school. His mother, interpreted by Felicity Jones, is victim of a serious illness and his father is living with another family while the grandmother is helping her daughter. The film has been nominated to 41 awards and has won 28 of them like for example the Goya Awards in 2017. It goes by UK and it's based on the Patrick Ness novel. It is about a boy who doesn't want to see what is the condition of his mother and draws like a way of escape. One night a monster comes out of a tree that it is in front of his house and goes for Conor to tell him three stories, announcing that the last one is going to be told by him and that it will be the truth. In a nutshell, it is a film you will recommend to every single person in the world, because with this movie you learn, you cry, you get angry, you feel emotions you didn't actually know you have and it is fantastic."
" See this film for the subject, not the performance
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,5,"A Monster Calls is the story of Connor, a young boy struggling to find himself awash a background of his mothers illness and a group of school yard bullies. Young star Lewis MacDougall previously seen in Pan does does the role of Connor justice, successfully portraying this roller-coaster of emotion with a cautious grit. Co-stars Felicity Jones (best known for her role as Jane Hawking in 2014's The Theory of Everything) and Sigourney Weaver (of the Alien franchise frame) however fail to live up to their young co-stars chops, delivering often weak or particularly in the case of Weaver, tired performances. So too is the performance of Liam Neeson (best known for 2008s Taken) in the role of the tree somewhat phoned home, and often times we're left wondering at the motivation of the character itself. While we can certainly forgive some of the bewilderment and often confused state many of the characters deliver to the messy situation with which they find themselves in, there are many times throughout the film where the audience is left simply frustrated. Similarly while the overall visuals do a good job of progressing the story in an engaging and captivating way, there are times when you have to wonder about the decision for some scenes to make the film. All in all a reasonable film delving into a murky and worthy subject, and for the reason alone worth watching alone or with the family."
" Deeply Emotional Yet Brutally Honest, A Monster Calls is an Amazing Fable
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,9,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Conor (Lewis MacDougall) is dealing with an impossibly difficult situation at such a young age. His mother (Felicity Jones) is dying of an unspecified disease. What makes this worse is that she's not only Conor's mother, she's his only friend. He's getting bullied at school for being the quiet and withdrawn kid and his Grandma (Sigourney Weaver) is cold and unable to relate to Conor effectively. His dad (Toby Kebbell) has divorced his mom and remarried so he's not there either. One night when Conor has stayed up late drawing, a Monster (Liam Neeson) made up from a large tree in the churchyard uproots and snatches Conor from his home. He doesn't wish to hurt Conor but tells him that his purpose is to re-visit him and tell him 3 stories. Conor refuses and initially tries to get rid of the Monster but after being possibly eaten by the Monster, he wakes up a little shaken but interested in seeing what happens next.This is a pretty dark story and although this was one of the best movies from 2016, I can see why it flopped at the box office. How do you sell this movie to the general audience? Unlike most movies geared towards families, this movie does not gloss over the darker side of these issues. In fact, it pulls back the curtain and throws it in your face. That's not a bad thing necessarily; most movies talk down to kids and don't trust them to understand. I admire that about this movie while cautioning people that this might be too much for little children to deal with. It might also be impossible to get through this movie without having an emotional breakdown. But I do feel that this movie does that honestly at least, most tearjerkers manipulate you to feel. The sadness that comes from watching this movie is from the subject matter not them constantly twisting the narrative to make things sappy. I'll admit I cried at the end but there were several different points in the movie I was tearing up.Another thing that movies for families do is fit characters into nice consistent forms to make things easier to process. A Monster Calls does something that is so rare in any type of movie; they give you well-drawn yet sympathetic characters which can't be described as completely good or bad. The first story the Monster tells is about just that lesson, that people aren't generally heroes or villains, they lie somewhere in the middle. His grandma isn't bad because she's cold, they just have so little in common and his dad isn't a jerk because he left, he just got married too young and it didn't work. The maturity of this movie is kind of astounding from that perspective.This movie is set in the real world and those scenes are interesting but they're not necessarily remarkable from a visual standpoint. The Monster looks really impressive, he's well rendered and they make him intimidating. They also tweak the design enough that he's different from other monsters like the Ents from Lord of the Rings. When the Monster begins to tell his stories though, the movie jumps into hyper-drive visually. Those animated scenes are gorgeous and they brought something different to the movie. I didn't want to miss a minute of them and they were really something else.The cast of the movie is pretty small but they all do excellent work. Lewis MacDougall hits all the right notes. He's got to sell all of this heavy material and he's up to the challenge. Felicity Jones works just as well, she's really doing a good job picking projects and she has to throw herself into this with the dramatic physical changes her character has to go through. Sigourney Weaver does a decent job, her accent is a little off but she's serviceable. Toby Kebbell doesn't get enough credit as an actor, this kind of movie showcases what he can do when he's not caught up in a failing franchise or a movie that's really special effects heavy. Liam Neeson was a good choice for the Monster, he's good at voice over work and his voice is a nice mix between intimidating and comforting.With all the hype this movie got, I expected to like it going in but I wasn't prepared for how touching and how nuanced A Monster Calls was. Sure, this movie makes you face some uncomfortable things but it should be praised for that instead of criticized for. This easily one of the best movies I saw from last year. It might not be 100% fun to watch but if you don't mind seeing some really dramatic material, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by this movie. Go see this movie, and bring a box of Kleenex."
" it's not about a monster
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,7,"in the first 5 minutes, I was think this movie would be so boring. But, the movie isn't going that way. slow but so touching, unpredictable moment and great acting by the kid. Honestly, I'm touch by his act. This movie is good for you that want to see a drama with a monster inside. yup, this is a drama movie, but its not like the others drama. worth to watch it"
" Outstanding
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,9,"Anyone who has read another of my reviews will understand that I don't try and guess any endings to a movie whilst watching it. I just try and enjoy what it brings, as it appears on screen.This movie is heartbreaking. Watching a young boy try to carry on with his life whilst his mother fights illness, dealing with the day to day horror that is bullying and trying to come to terms with an estranged father is more horrific than any zombie movie. The movie deals with the above head on and in no way glorifies any of it.What makes this movie stand out is what the viewer takes from the experience. Most movies these days have the US Army or a miracle doctor in Washington save the day. This movie splashes into the waters of loss and washes all over you. There is the hero in the form of the Monster, but this movie teaches you that sometimes heroes don't save the day in the movieland way you would expect.An amazing all round spectacle. The Monster looks and sounds fantastic, the gloomy UK scenery is all too realistic and the acting is top notch. All in all, this is a great way to spend an evening, just bring a box of tissues."
" Monster calls is a emotional movie that works out at some places and could have been better if minor flaws were avoided
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,7,Monster calls is a emotional movie that works out at some places and could have been better if minor flaws were avoidedMy rating- 3.5/5(Good) Positives- 1.)Story - Story was good and it was emotional. It succeeded in bringing out emotions but director failed to interpret it. Direction by J.A.Bayona wasn't that great and if his direction was good than it could have worked out properly. Because of his limited imagination even the story telling gets affected and it makes the film in a kidish zone. There were minor flaws but it got summed up and became a major flaw. My rating got increased is only because of its story and actors performance.2.)Lewis and Jones- Lewis succeeded in portraying as frustrated Conor who's having hopes for his mothers recovery and i really loved his performance. All his emotional scenes were maturely handled and it looked natural. Jones as Mother acted wonderful who wishes to live for 100 years. Jones character who suffers from terminal illness and all her hopes and emotions were smoothly portrayed by her.3.)Visual effects- Visual effects is the main component of this film. Vfx Team needs applause as they did it without any flaws and they didn't give us any cheesy feel throughout this film.4.)Cinematography Negatives- 1.)Slow paced Narration2.)Average Direction by J.A.Bayona 3.)Average Script Overall- There are too many messages in this film like it reveals the complexity of humanity and various other messages which makes it a good watch for children and family. It might not work as Heart wrenching masterpiece or emotionally moving but its worth a try for its good story.My rating- 3.5/5 (Good)
" Monster and Boy
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,8,"Liam Neeson is the voice of a tree monster who appears to a boy, Connor, whose mother is suffering from a terminal illness. The monster has morality tales to tell the kid which he needs to make it through his mother's terrible suffering. The visuals reminded me of ""Pan's Labyrinth"", one of my favorite movies ever made. While not as good as Guillermo Del Toro's masterpiece, ""A Monster Calls"" is still a worthy fantasy drama with excellent performances by Lewis Macdougall as the boy and Felicity Jones as his mother. Neeson's voice has a deep resonance which is both commanding and soothing and he delivers the lines with a Shakespearean quality. This is one of the most overlooked films of 2016."
" Yet another mis-advertised movie...
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,4,"So, if you watch the trailer for this film, you might be forgiven for thinking that it is a fantasy romp suitable to take your children to see. The fantastic elements of the film are prioritised in the trailer and the addition of a stirring, epic theme might make you think it is all going to be good fun.But look again. The dialogue should tell you that there is something dark going on in this film but don't be tempted to think it is just an ""obstacle"" for the characters to overcome. It really is dark.What the film is, is a coming of age drama about a boy whose mother is dying of cancer and his struggle to come to terms with that. The fantastic elements are, much like Bridge to Terabithia, simply the way that the boy makes sense of the events over which he has no control.Unlike Terabithia, however, A Monster Calls has no light moments preceding the darker moments of the film. It is all darak. Dark, and dreary, and terribly depressing. The eventual catharsis the boy experiences at the end of the movie can in no way wash away the downward mood swing this feature will engender throughout its runtime.So be warned, despite the trailer, this is not a kid's movie in any way, shape, or form. If I'm honest, I'm not sure who would find this movie entertaining. At most, it might make you think a little but, if you've ever had any kind of childhood trauma you might consider giving it a miss. It really is that depressing.On the plus side, it is reasonably well acted, especially by newcomer Lewis MacDougall. Others, less so, and I have no idea what Sigourney Weaver was doing with her accent other than to say I've never heard anyone English talk like that.Visually, it is very striking, but that is really all that is going for it as a form of entertainment. The band Fallout Boy once wrote a song with the lyrics ""The best of us can find happiness in misery..."" This movie puts a lie to that assertion. There is no joy to be found is this movie, only despondency and sadness.Mostly, I think this just goes to show you should never trust a movie trailer to judge a film's content by. Another recent example of this was Mr. Holmes, which portrayed its subject matter as a light hearted romp as well. At least that one doesn't leave you feeling miserable by the end of it.In short, not a fun movie in any way and woefully misrepresented by its marketing media, which seemed intent on simply getting as many bums on seats in the auditorium as possible.SUMMARY: Horribly depressing look at life, and its end. Not for children, ever. Not really for adults, either. Well made, but dreary and terribly badly marketed. Avoid."
" Producers should reflect their tricks
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,4,"A typical film ingratiates clammy psychology, and covered with healthiness.A children-called commercial film. Commercially contains violence pitfall and horror to make a good box office result, actually unhealthful for children watching alone.A story of surmounting difficulties through family matters, but puts all foci and judgements on child's subjectivism, ignores the true and solvable matters from family responsibility and society. Finally made and satisfied Stockholm syndrome people.A child-act film, but really an adult production, gives a vision of suffering child and no adult-need message. It is easily related with some adults seeking uncommon novelty."
" Amazing movie!
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,10,"First off I will say that the ads for this movie miss sold it to me the exact same way that ""Bridge to Terabithia"" did. This is not a kids movie and it is going to make you sad because it is about a sad situation. So prepare for that.It is basically about a boy dealing with the struggles of losing his mother. He has an imagination and a lot of skill with drawing. He is trying to deal with the fact that his father doesn't want him and he doesn't want to be with his grandmother because she is a hard woman and strict.I see a lot of people who I don't think got the whole movie. If you watch this, look at the photos that are on the wall of the room in the final scene because that is what really blew my mind and made me change my opinion on this whole movie when I started connecting the dots and replaying scenes from my memory. This is one of those movies that you can watch and have a really good discussion on!"
" The de facto sequel to Pan's Labyrinth
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,8,"Released kind of at the same time with The BFG, it can be considered similar, as it explores the rich inner life of children wishing reality was different, but to me it was more like Pan's Labyrinth, in both dramatism and .. err... Spanishness.If there was something that didn't quite work here, it was the acting. The kid was OK, but all the other characters were played mechanically. The imaginative script was complimented by the good special effects, but in the end, their quality didn't help to further the story much. I would have preferred to feel more from the acting.Bottom line: be warned, this is a mom dying of cancer movie, but it was interesting and it felt refreshing."
" A inner battle
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,9,"This movie could be considered a piece of human suffering. Three main lessons are shown in the form of stories. Three tales told by a monster to a young man, who was trying to drive away his own nightmares whilst its mother was fighting against cancer. There was a fourth tale as well. This one was told by the young boy to the monster. And the tale arise in form of nightmare. A nightmare that never ends if you do not tell you the truth, if you do not accept your deepest fears We all have this monster inside (our fears, our doubts, our awareness) and each monster is frightening. We need to recognize him, cope with him, and we finally can be free.https://medium.com/@ikergarcia9/a-monster-calls-a-inner-battle- b481190733b8#.y0sbhocd9"
" Answer the Call
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,7,"For a movie that pushed back it's release date to the new year, presumably to be considered for Oscar season, there are many times in the movie that show that was a smart decision. The movie grips you from beginning to end as you are thrust into the eyes of a 12 year old boy named Conor who is dealing with a parent who has cancer. It's a tough message to convey to an audience if that audience were 12 year old's but for an adult the movie speaks volumes. While the script is predictable in that everything happens the way you imagine it would, that doesn't lessen the grief that you experience while watching it. The performances by all of the characters are wonderful and you really attach yourself to the main character especially in the final third of the movie. What I really appreciated about this film is that it didn't shy away from the very tough conversations that come with someone having cancer such as figuring out what to tell a child about his parents progress and how dealing with it bleeds into other parts of your life such as school. The real stand out of this film though, is the monster. You can tell Liam Neeson had fun playing this role and as the movie progresses you will want to see more scenes with him. The stories he shares with Conor are beautiful in their creation as is the monster himself. The CGI was lifelike and did not take me out of the movie at all, quite the opposite. Those stories that the monster shares are the highlight of the film as Conor is told that he will be told three stories and then have to tell one of his own about his truth that comes from his nightmare. All of those stories are beautiful metaphors and really hit home.Where the film stumbles is in it's script. The story itself is very predicable so if you have ever seen a sad movie like this before you know how it will go. It seems like at many times it is coupled with the score to tell you exactly when is the right time to cry. The movie is sad in and of itself and don't worry, you will cry. With that said it makes you see that the story is not about the illness but about how a young person deals with such an illness and the coping mechanism they use. My brother came out of the film asking who the audience was for this film and I didn't have a fast answer because it seems like a perfect movie to have a young child watch to help them understand but the adult tones and rating beg to differ. I imagine this is the type of movie that is good for a parent to see how to help their child when they are going through something difficult."
" A monster calls review
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,10,I have never written a review on a film but felt I had to as regards to this one. It had me gripped from the start. Connor reminds me of my 8 year old son and for some reason seems as vulnerable. The story is great yet full of sorrow. Sorrow through the eyes of a twelve year old boy. Lewis's acting is amazing!!! I have to say. So I thought was the directing. I have never sobbed as much as I did at this story. I lost my dad to cancer nearly 11 years ago and though I was not a child I could totally understand the wishing it was all over quickly to save the heartache. I totally got this film. It gave me a heart wrenching feeling that I don't think I'll forget for a long while. Well done to all involved and thank you. Xx
" Watcher Beware!
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,3,"If you have ever lost someone to a terminal illness, do yourself a favor and skip this dark, gut-wrenching movie. It was the most depressing piece I have ever watched.

" Simply Astonishing that speaks nothing but the truth..........
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"While Disney is making charming movies every year filled with magic , A Monster Calls is the rare offering by the Cinema that dares to tell the haunting pain of letting someone loved go away from especially for a child. The Story is based on a boy Connor whose Mother is ill , father has left them and is with other woman. In his deep heart he knows the truth that his mother will one day leave him but he is unable to accept it and it quickly takes a turn on his whole life from being bullied to unable to express himself clearly. He is entitled to live with her grandmother but he doesn't like her.He every night has the same nightmare where his mother is falling in a deep pit and he extends his hand towards her but couldn't save her or it appears so as he wakes up at 12:07 before we can make anything out of it. He is then visited by a human like yew tree which tells him that he will recite him three stories after which Connor will tell him his nightmare. He did come and all of the three stories exactly resonates to one or the other person in his life and carries a important message. I will not reveal the stories here as it is the best part of the film which is not only visually enchanting but also deeply moving. During the course of this three stories many things happen which one way or the other changes him.All this time the film acts as a perfect piece of cinema offering great performances accompanied by stellar direction. Liam Neeson also excels the yew tree monster.When the time finally comes for him to tell his story , the last 20 minutes of the film are heart wrenching to see but it also serves a message. At last he understands it and finally let her mother go which is really amazing to see. Not to forget that the monster of his dreams was probably his grandfather and all those stories were actually written by his mother in form of paintings so it was their message to him.The Best part of this film is that it's different. It's not cute or adorable but just showcases pain of a 12 year old and his issues about his own life. It shows the exact emotion that needed to be showed and makes him uplifting his own spirits and becoming courageous in the end thus making us not having pity him but being proud of him. There are many many friendly or family type movies every year but films like this are rare as they are there but rarely touches the core of our heart which this film does.The films also boasts incredible Visual effects and fairly haunting Cinematography to say the least but still it's one of the sad movies that are also feel good. Although it's bad it wasn't a box office hit as it deserved much more. Still , It's good to see such films are still here although I don't expect it to sweep any awards or be breakthrough but it is what it is."
" We lose, we find, we carry on
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,10,"What's up with Ireland, always going with the sad, double-edge way of viewing life? Almost every single Irish flick I see, it draws its joys from the sorrows and vice versa. What made Ireland so special to go with such a yin-yang sense of being, right there in the middle of a European civilization? A harsh treatment all along its history? A solemn Catholic presence along with the strong Celtic roots? A nature both beautiful and stern? I'll never know for sure. What I do know is that those Irish stories are often the most deeply touching and sincere, despite the hard way they are told in. And A Monster Calls is no exception.The reason why it had toppled in the theaters might be that people have wrong expectations of this film. Yes, it's a story featuring a boy and a huge Groot'esque walking tree. It doesn't, however, make this film a kiddie fairy tale. Fairy tales these days only try to tell you something sweet so that you have a good sleep at night. A Monster Calls instead awakens your thoughts and emotions, offering you to face your nightmares instead of avoiding them. That's disturbing, bitter and sad, and most people don't like feeling like that. Although it's that very case when the bitter pill might in fact be the most soothing one.All our lives we have to deal with the hardships of some or other sorts. We may run, we may hide, we may even pretend they don't exist. But as long as there are things, or people, which have it in their power to affect us and to hurt us, we will remain vulnerable. Some things, we can overcome. Some things we can adapt to. And some things, we just have to accept and make peace with it. Which might be the hardest thing for us mere mortals to do.These words may sound cryptic and nonsensical. It's probably expectable when a film goes about the topics of life, death, ambiguity of some things and inevitability of others, and you have to write a review, not a philosophical essay. Yet the power of A Monster Calls is that it turns those ever-complex concepts into a narrative even a preteen would be able to understand and feel through. In fact, it does tha so well that, after the credits finish rolling, you can only admit that you hardly have words to add to what you've just seen.So give yourself a favor and watch this movie. Young or old, you will find here a theme relevant to yourself, and a sad beauty of truth about it."

I think that even the persons who consider themselves as types who don't cry this movie might bring a tear from all of you.This movie is one of the reasons movies are art. When motion picture completely separates you from the reality and it wakes your emotions like you really never expect one movie will do....this is one of those moviesI would really love for this movie to reach as many viewers as possible. Don't watch the trailer.Sit back and enjoy the story of boy who is too old to be a child...a boy who is too young to be a men..."
" Psychologically Emotional!
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"When I first watched the trailer of it, I totally thought it to be another film for ""Children Only""!But I was wrong, Damn Wrong!I will not give any spoilers here, for the sake of the viewers!So let's come straight to the Pros & Cons!PROS : #1 The story started a little bit slowly but gradually it picked up the speed! Love the moments of building up the whole scene!#2 Cinematography & VFX is awesome! Specially the stories that the ""Monster"" tells us will make you amaze!#3 Performances from all the actors were truly brilliant, Specially from Lewis MacDougall!! What a spectacular performance he's given! Even other adult characters fell into the shadow just because of him! He totally carries the film on his shoulders!#4 Felicity Jones as the mother is superb! Love the fantastic Mother-Son chemistry here! We could relate to their every emotions there! Joy, Sorrow, Anger, Everything!!#5 This film is sort of unique in it's own way! and why is that?cause this film shows us the ""Real Truth"" of our lives!Being presented in a child's story, it depicts the emotions thatgo through in our everyday life! It teaches us many things!In a beautiful way!CONS :- Actually there aren't many CONS here but I would really like to mention some things here that I personally did not like it about!#1 First of all Apart from Grandma, Mother's character I did not like the Dad's character! I don't know why, Toby Kebbell Acted well, with no complaints from me whatsoever! But I did not like the inclusion of the character! It could have been much more Effective & Strong!#2 I loved the 2nd half of the film so much that I would have really loved it even better if the first half was as good as the second one! The first half takes some amount of time to build up and bring pace to the story! So could have been much more emotionally triggering! Just like the rest of it!OVERALL :- A really brilliant film, did not expect so much greatness from it to be honest! You would be surprised to see how much maturity the story has here!It's NOT AT ALL For under 10 Kids! Not at All!It's more for the Teenagers! And for those Adults who love Strong Emotional content!"

Life isn't 'and they all lived happily ever after', and people have to find ways to cope with their fears and in the masterpiece we get to witness how this little boy handled the horror he was about to face.I'm not going to say much more apart from this is a must, it's sad, but brilliant, don't miss this beauty."
" Too Gloomy and Unpleasant Story
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"The boy Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) has frequent nightmares and is facing several problems. His beloved mother Lizzie (Felicity Jones) has a terminal illness and he might have to live with his strict grandmother Mrs. Clayton (Sigourney Weaver). His estranged father (Toby Kebbell) lives in the United States of America. He is bullied at school by Harry (James Melville). One night, Conor is visited by a tree-like Monster (Liam Neeson) at 12:07 AM that tells that he will tell three true stories to Conor; in return, the boy will tell his own story to the Monster about the truth behind his nightmare. ""A Monster Calls"" is a drama with a too gloomy and unpleasant story. The cast has magnificent performances highlighting the boy Lewis MacDougall. The special effects are excellent and the voice of Liam Neeson is creepy. But the sad slow-paced story is too dark and viewers may be misled by the trailer with the tree-like monster believing it is a fantasy. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Sete Minutos Depois da Meia-Noite"" (""Seven Minutes After Midnight"")"

",2017-01-31 00:00:00,7,"Monster Calls is a surprise to me, I did not know of its existence, I only discovered when the movie was about to debut, and only now I took the courage to watch and I liked it a lot, it's a good movie, with a good cast, highlight Liam Neeson making the voice of the monster, the direction of Bayona is very good, is director to keep an eye, has a great future, the script is good, but there are problems, I found the relationship of the Boy with his Bullyng weak and a little without Sense, the soundtrack is good, the picture is great, the film has a somber tone that marries perfectly with the movie, the CGI to make the monster is amazing, very well done, and the best that is not an exaggerated CGI, I found That the rhythm has lost its strength in some moments, and the best scenes are with the monster, A Monster Calls is a good movie that can take a few tears.

" An outstanding film
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,9,"Man o Man. This film was great the child in this film was absolutely phenomenal at acting his part along with the rest of the cast. Liam Neeson voiced the Monster in this movie and he too did a great job. To the more intelligent movie goer there is allot to take in between the set design and superb animation. The monster is very well done and the persona he created through out the movie is really quite interesting. In the end this is a must see for either the young adult and or adult. Their is also an underlying depth to the movie about letting go to things and really the whole movie was moving, well thought out, and is among some of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion."
" Humans are Complicated Beasts... That's Life
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,8,"""A boy seeks the help of a tree monster to cope with his single mother's terminal illness.""Based upon the novel written by Patrick Ness, A Monster Calls is directed by J.A. Bayona (The Impossible). He knows how to tell a compelling story in his movies and A Monster Calls is no exception. I did not read the book, but it makes me want to read it after seeing this wonderful movie. Patrick Ness did the screenplay too, so I would assume the movie is very similar to his own book.The actors were great, including Lewis MacDougall (Conor), who plays the ""too old to be a child, and to young to be a man"". He carries this movie almost by himself, as we follow his inner conflicts. I was totally invested in his character throughout the film. Liam Neeson (The Monster), Toby Kebbell, Felicity Jones and Sigourney Weaver were all great following the lead of MacDougall.I was surprised by all the visual effects put in this movie, all the dye artwork and The Monster itself. The style, elegance were just stunning.I Hope this movie gets more recognition, since it bombed at the box office. You should really take a look at this movie if you are interested. Kids and parents will like it, but I feel like the parents will enjoy it more, since it has a deeper meaning, tells the truth and nothing but the truth and brings you back to your childhood.Entertaining, sad and an unforgettable tale that will sticks with you for a long time, worth watching."
" No need to say much about this movie. It speaks for itself. This one is perfection !
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,10,"""I will tell you three stories. And when I'm done with my stories, will you tell me a fourth. I don't know any stories. You will tell me a fourth and it will be the truth.""I'm not easily impressed and rating a movie with a maximum score is an oddity for me, but the impact of ""A monster calls"" on me was unprecedented. And not only because of the deeper meaning behind the story of young Conor and his terminally ill mother Lizzie, but also because of the brilliant performances of Lewis MacDougall and Sigourney Weaver (Conor's grandmother), the modest acting of Felicity Jones, the sometimes masterfully used special effects and the three profound stories told by the monster with the impressive deep voice of Liam Neeson. It's not really surprising it turned out to be an emotionally charged story. Only the emotional parts are so pure and humane that even I, who usually looks at such moments soberly and dry-eyed, got a lump in my throat. But especially the denouement gave the story a mysterious turn. Overall, a fantastic film that deserves the maximum score.When I say I have an unspeakable admiration for the young actor Lewis MacDougall, you can safely say it's a huge understatement. This young boy has such charisma and naturelle. Why this film was not even nominated for an Oscar, is for me a complete mystery. The emotions young Conor is going through, are so diverse and he displays them in such an obvious way. I can only conclude that he's a natural acting talent. The character Conor handles a wide spectrum of emotions. From rage and anger, to some brief happy moments. From fear and despair, to courage and determination. And finally the immense grief after the loss of a loved one, the letting go and the acceptance as central themes. All this is brought by this young actor convincingly. Respect.The film tends to place itself into the fantasy corner, with this huge yew tree that moves around in a destructive way. It reminded me of one of ""The Ents"" from ""Lord of the Rings"". The same appearance. The same voice full of wisdom. The only goal this creature out of Connor's fantasy has, is to make it clear to him that life isn't always rosy or easy, and that he'll be confronted with difficult moments during his life. Conor's life on the other hand isn't so rosy and he faced already some terrible events in his short life. A fatherless upbringing, a terminally ill mother and the terrible bullying at school. Situations that cause him to enter a psychological whirligig with terrible nightmares as a result. Nightmares in which he consistently tries to save his mother, while she threatens to disappear into a huge crater. And always the nightmare ends with him not being able to save his mother. You don't need to be Freud to know the deeper psychological meaning of that dream.Some will say perhaps ""A monster calls"" belongs to the category of youth movies. However, I don't share that opinion. Even though the tree monster looks intriguing and not too creepy. And those stories are presented as with water-ink illustrated fairy tales. Nevertheless, the ultimate message is of a more mature nature. The fairy-tale stories have a rather sinister undertone and deal with deception and guile. They are telling the story of the complex human mind. I'm afraid that children will only see the fairy-tale of the tree and won't understand the deeper meaning behind it. I even wondered if there wasn't even a hidden story behind the main story? Wasn't the man next to Lizzie, on that picture hanging in that room in the end, Liam Neeson? And what about the content in that sketchbook that Conor is looking at in the end? And how come the monster turns up at 00: 07 from the beginning on? When all the pieces fell into place in the end, it felt as if it opened a completely different dimension. After that I could only gaze at the screen while feeling numb and confused. What is it that makes a movie to reach perfection? It's not just because of the matchless imagery. And not only because of the wonderful performances. Or that beautiful story. But also because of the effect a movie has on me. ""A monster calls"" has all these features and especially the last item. So, I call this movie perfection.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
" This is not a kids' movie. Its a child's story. Do not deny yourself that.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"This movie will give words to your grief. It will open you up, lay you bare, and take out that little pack of grief inside you, hold it up against light and show you how it looks from up close. What its made of. What is its texture. It will give a name to your feelings, a face to your emotions. Give yourselves this movie's insight.What NOT to assume about the movie: Do not take this movie by its name. Or its trailer. This is not a kids' movie. Its a child's story. Do not take it as an attempt at a tear jerker. Do not take it as a run-of-the-mill art movie. Do not take it as anything you have seen before. It WILL shake you. Your insides. Your core. Your hands will not move to fast forward once, even when there is no action and no flashy fight scenes. Beware, in the era of more visuals than substance, your ears will surprisingly listen. Your eyes will watch. You will want to know what happens, and how, even when you know it. The emotions are the most red form of raw. They have been wrenched apart from real life and placed in front of the camera as they were. The actors, for this brilliance, deserve a thank you beyond the scope of my expression. This movie holds a different meaning for everyone. If you have never felt personal grief, it will shock you by what its like when the stakes are high. If you have personally suffered, you will find yourself saying 'oh this is so true.this is how it was.'Thats how it was for me, who has lost dear ones personally, and my husband, who hasn't. When Conor's truth was revealed, my husband gasped 'how could he?' while I smiled painfully, understanding exactly what Conor meant. These reactions were simultaneous and worlds apart, while we were watching the same movie at the same time.Watch it. In a world of fantastic beasts and assassin's creeds, give your soul a chance. Do not deny yourself this child's story."

This is a drama about coping with loss of loved ones. Children will probably be scared by some scenes and the rest of it they'll probably not understand.From a technical standpoint, it's a triumph. The cinematography is not just mere background. Everything plays its role. I am very keen to see what this director will offer us next.You will weep, you will smile.

The whole movie revolves around that young boy's fears and dreams of her mother leaving him alone. The only escape he can find is in his friend – A monster. The monster, to ease the pain of the young boy, tells tales which eventually help the boy to face the truth of life and give him strength to let her mother go. The support of family we all need has been displayed beautifully.What I like best? Visual effects were brilliant, and the tales in the voice of Liam Neeson were awesome. All the actors performed very good. In my opinion, this family movie is worth a watch."
" Lively Cast & Unique Plot,
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,8,"A Monster Calls is a great movie with a well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a deep, meaningful film that blends fantasy and real life together beautifully in a way that neither of them feel forced, they are both there to serve each other. Conor's relationship with each character is very well established, we understand how they feel towards him and how he feels towards them significantly. The character development is phenomenal. The only major criticism I would have is that it tries a little too hard to leave us in tears on a regular basis, it could have been a bit more subtle in its exposition here. It was too clear that is was trying to be a tearjerker rather than simply delivering emotional material that could leave us in sadness.The cast is all around terrific, Lewis MacDougall shines in the lead role, the young man clearly has a bright future ahead of him. Felicity Jones is strong as the ill mother and Liam Neeson's voice work as the Monster is well suited for the character. The highlight of the film, for me, had to be Sigourney Weaver, in one of the best performances I have seen her in. She has an unquestionable screen presence in this role, and her English accent is very convincing. The film leaves you with a smile on your face as the journey Conor faces is both hard hitting and relatable. Heartfelt and well written, A Monster Calls is worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama or fantasy. A monster helps a young boy cope with the illness of his mother. Best Performance: Sigourney Weaver"
" Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,"""A boy seeks the help of a tree monster to cope with his single mother's terminal illness."" This film was horribly advertised and there was hardly any mention of it at all under any circumstances. You really have to go searching for this monster, and when you do it looks like a little kids Fantasy Movie, and its not even the case! This movie is the best way to describe what goes through a child's mind when he has to deal with something like this. The child while losing his only mother/father tends to go into Fantasy Land to try and pretend that this isn't real. Instead of doing the typical escape into fantasy land where no one can hear/see you the Monster (voiced by Liam Neeson) is there to help the boy to face reality and to get him though all of this.The acting was top notch, the directing was brilliant, the effects were great, and the finale 20 mins is just heartbreaking. It made us cry, and it's hard to make Autistic cry...trust us! But it's not really a film for kids, it's a film for adults. It's one of the most saddest movies we've seen in a while. It pulls at your heartstrings and it knew just when to do it.Really, really amazing film and just what happens when your child is going through a horrible stage like this. The Autistic Reviewers give this 5/5 stars, 10/10. Check us out on facebook!"
" Emotional and engaging film that could help children learn to talk about difficult emotions
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,9,"Grief was a prominent theme at the movies in 2016, but no movie has tackled that anger and helplessness quite like ""A Monster Calls,"" this year, or ever. Using magical realism in familiar but effective ways, ""A Monster Calls"" breaks down the pain and guilt of loss and suffering in a way that's accessible for younger audiences yet authentic to adult experiences.Adapted for the screen by Patrick Ness from his own novel and brought to life by J.A. Bayona (""The Impossible,"" ""The Orphanage""), ""A Monster Calls"" tells the story of a 12-year-old Conor (Lewis MacDougall), a daydreamer who loves to draw, is bullied at school and whose single mother (Felicity Jones) is extremely ill. Beaten down by life, Conor is paid a visit by a massive monster (voiced by Liam Neeson) that emerges from the nearby yew tree despite Conor's pleas to be left alone. The monster tells Conor that he will visit him three times and tell him three stories, and the fourth time, Conor will tell him a story, a story that will reveal the truth, a truth of which he is very afraid.The film bounces between real-life scenarios in which Conor must deal with his worsening mother, strict grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) and even his estranged father (Toby Kebbell) visiting from America, with encounters from the monster after midnight each night at 12:07. As one would expect, these fantastical episodes reflect and inform Conor's everyday drama and emotions.""A Monster Calls"" is at its most captivating in the imaginative sequences featuring the monster and his stories, especially toward the beginning before the real-world story picks up steam. These digital water color animated fairy tales, especially their editing and visualization, provide a tremendous boost in energy that draws us further into the story as a whole despite the fact that they technically digress from the plot. They also provide young viewers with a familiar story structure to convey important morals and messages that pertain to Conor's experiences, messages normally too complicated for fairy tales. Ness' story (based on an idea by Siobhan Dowd) personifies emotions and inner struggle in a way not all that dissimilar from Pixar's ""Inside Out."" The monster guides Conor and teaches him lessons, but he is also a projection of Conor's subconscious that embodies his feelings of rage and inner torment. Through the monster, Conor learns how to express himself during this tumultuous time. Thankfully, the adults on the receiving end of his real-world expressions respond in productive ways.Conor's mother, grandmother and father have flaws and challenges that affect Conor in different ways, but Ness makes sure they don't provide even greater obstacles for him to overcome. It's enough for a character to navigate the family dynamics at play when someone is dying, to throw in the complications of an adult who makes things worse might be more true to life, but would distract from the core messages the film is trying to transmit. Still, Jones, Weaver and Kebbell can show how their characters are struggling too and not simply be perfect rocks for Conor to lean on. MacDougall also has a lot of promise as a young actor. This is a part that requires a lot of emotion and yet a lot of restraint. He must have enough imagination to add to the magical scenes and enough of a grip on reality too. Viewers of all ages must also be able to see part of themselves in Conor to empathize rather than just sympathize with him. MacDougall absolutely keeps us engaged emotionally as the film unfolds.""A Monster Calls"" is an emotional film punctuated with the spark of imagination, one that combines beauty and fantasy with tragedy in a way similar to Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth."" It's not all that discrete in what it's doing or how it operates, but the intent behind it and the truth about the world that it wants to address is too admirable and important to dismiss. More than anything else, if ""A Monster Calls"" helps just one parent and child talk about grief, loss, guilt or anger it will have justified its entire production. More people just need to see it, and it undoubtedly will.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
" Stunningly beautiful masterpiece
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,10,"I'll keep it short and spoiler free. This film is an incredibly moving journey about loss and acceptance. For me it was not overly sentimental in the typical Hollywood way but a more humanistic and real feel to the grief and loss portrayed on screen. The film is completely carried bit the truly excellent performance from the young lead, he is convincing in every aspect and is superb to watch. Liam Neeson brings a warmth & gravity to his character whilst Sigourney Weaver brings strength and vulnerability to her role as the misunderstood grandmother. It has been a long time since a film has moved me so much and by the end of this film I was in tears. Honestly top notch stuff."
" Monsters Aren't All Bad
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"A Monster Calls is a fantasy drama film based on the novel by Patrick Ness, which itself was an idea conceived by Siobhan Dowd, who died before she could write it. A little bullied British boy with a love for monsters/monster movies has a mom (Felicity Jones) dying from cancer, a dad who has his own family in America, and a grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) who's just too stern. So the little boy, who used to rely on his mom to get him through all of his worries and woes, suddenly feels alone in the world. Until a tree monster (Liam Neeson) comes along, telling the boy 3 stories, claiming that at the end, the boy must tell his own story, his own truth. And so the boy listens to each story, and each one causes him to examine his own life, and learn an important, but sad truth. This movie was beautiful. The CGI was fantastical. The story felt like it was coming from a childlike point of view, and each shot was reflective of the development of the characters. The story-telling elements blended computer animation with amazing watercolor artwork to give them a more fictional look to the traditional live action sequences. The director really knows how to play emotion through lighting. Just, beautiful cinematography as a whole completed this film. As for the acting, it was superb. This was due in large part to Lewis MacDougall, who has only had one acting credit before this in Pan. The boy plays complex emotions and thoughts through his journey, and many times had me tearing up as I felt his pain, anger, and sadness. He kept me engrossed in the film, and I was shocked. Young actors can often drag down an otherwise amazing film. MacDougall enhanced this one. Of course, the talents of Felicity Jones and Sigourney Weaver can't go unnoticed. The actresses spend much of the film displaying their own struggles. Their own emotions seem hard to interpret at times. This is once again due to the direction, which allows us to see these characters through a young boy's mind. Adults will understand what's going on, but find it's hidden in a haze of innocence. And finally, we have Liam Neeson. His deep Irish voice and tough presence are exactly the things needed for the tree monster. Neeson narrates each story with a wisdom and clarity of knowing something MacDougall's character is learning, because he himself had experienced each one. He does an incredible job, and must be appreciated. Of course, I must discuss the negatives. In this movie, there isn't much to complain about, but I do have some nitpicks. The monster played by Liam Neeson is a great character, but his look kept making me think that at any moment he was going to start saying ""I am Groot."" The designs were too similar. Also, I felt like the storytelling, beautiful as it was, was missing something. I don't know what it was, but I can't help but feel Guillermo Del Toro would have figured it out. And the score felt a little cheesy. It was emotional clichés. Nothing popped out as memorable. Just notes to make you feel things. It definitely could have been better. In the end, A Monster Calls is the movie no one saw in theaters, but everyone should. It's beautiful, and emotional, and amazing. Please, when you can, watch this film. You won't regret it. 85/100"
" A Monster Calls is a solid fantasy drama
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"The film is a semi-fantastical drama dotted with splashy visual effects, notably a Liam Neeson-voiced anthropomorphic tree that stalks the young protagonist's dreams and subconscious.Director J.A. Bayona (""The Impossible"") again ambitiously examines the mind- set of a boy struggling with adult-size burdens, and he's got perfect material to work from in the insightful script by source novelist Patrick Ness. But MacDougall, fittingly, leaves the biggest mark. In a movie-going season that has trained a spotlight on tamped-down emotion, he's impressively stifled in his own right. ""A Monster Calls"" is a portrait of coping that's both fascinating and heartbreaking. I go with 3.5/5 for Bayona directed fantasy yet emotional tale."
" wanderer feeling
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,9,"this movie belongs to those movies which puts you in a wanderer feeling,stare to the screen watching the credits and only thing in your mind the fear of losing the ones you love but will makes you satisfied if you let them go.A Monster Calls is based on a novel by Patrick Ness. J.A.Bayona ( the director ) made something here , something that touch your heart in few seconds and makes you see it , feel it and live it by fascinating dialogues that rarely hear and stunning visual effects and for sure the sound of Liam Neeson , 1st time to me watch J.A.Bayona work but i am sure it will not be the last*btw sorry 4 the grammar"
" A Monster Calls (2016)
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,7,"Based on the novel of the same name, A Monster Calls is about a boy who gets visits from a monster at 12:07 am and pm. This tree like monster tells him three stories and demands that the fourth story be told by the boy and be the true confrontation of his nightmare. Conor (the lead character) also has a dying mother and must not only deal with that and the monster but also deals with bullying and how to come face to face with his grief. The plot sounds very confusing I'm sure but its not once you get into the grove of the film.First impressions is that this is not a film for kids, its too dark for children. The subject matter is serious and dark, and it could be scary for a young audience. There's also a depiction of bullying on multiple counts, which could be too real for the young folks. Getting past that, I think the film is a bit of a mixed bag. Without getting into spoilers, the fourth story and reveal of Conor's nightmare is done very well. The thing is you kind of have to sit and wait for it and the film spends periods just limping to the end.The delivery of the film is intriguing. I wasn't blown away by the CG monster but there is an air of familiarity hearing the voice of Liam Neeson beaming from the giant. The stories are entertaining and told from a graphic heavy perspective (which is fine), its the in-between the story moments that are really hit or miss. There are areas where the film is at a standstill which makes me wonder if the film would have worked better as an hour long special. Its a bit of an ambitious effort from a filmmaker who usually has an interesting story to tell but it comes down to the source and how it can be adapted.I was thrown off a bit by Sigourney Weaver in the film but thought Felicity Jones was good. It was harrowing seeing her as the film went on and seeing her progression get worse. There are a few heavy moments in the film that could get a casual moviegoer to shed some tears, but for me I can't escape how disengaged I felt at many points in the film. The way I see it, this was probably a very interesting novel but not one that could be adapted properly because its thin.6.5/10"
" It touched me
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,10,"This is the really first movie that has made me cry but it is absolutely amazing. I really was not expecting a lot about this movie, even when it started it seemed to be a movie for kids and about fiction but it was really well realized, from the serious felling that it has to the combination of the reality and psychology with the imagination from a boy who is suffering in very different ways. It achieved a point where I really had to cry because it made me think about me in the pants from the boy. Also I have to recognize the incredible job from the young main of the movie who being that young gets to express all those emotions"
" Literally, one of the saddest movies EVER!
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"I was expecting a children's mythical adventure - similar to BFG which, I enjoyed quite a bit. In the opening credits I hear Sean Connery's voice narrating and see that Sigourney Weaver is also starring and got pretty excited as I hadn't heard much about this film.This is NOT a film for kids unless you want them to have nightmares and be scared of trees. And frankly, if you have lost anyone to Cancer, (and who hasn't?, then this may be a little too raw.The little boys acting was amazing - the psychology behind his story is very relatable, and that is why its so sad. Like - REALLY SAD! Stock up on the tissue, and if you're like me and don't like to cry in front of others, then you probably want to watch this one alone."
" Nuanced Beauty
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,9,"This is a film dominated by two elements - the imagination of a child, and the visceral reality of the world. As someone who's only recently left childhood and is living adulthood, I can relate to both elements. The story is a symbolic one, told through both elements in very different ways. The real life scenarios are by definition real life, it's a hard truth that will coax tears like no other film - hence why this is such a powerful story. At the same time, we're experiencing the mind of a child who, afraid of the events that happen in real life, turns to his imagination for solace and security.It is a very enlightening experience, as the viewer is shown why the truth is both important and hard to accept. But it can always be endured - even for a child like Connor. That message is told with clarity throughout the film, and the characters grow because of it. The narrative element to the film is also explicitly well told, each individual artistic representation having its own message and theme. This culminates in one definitive coming-of-age story in which Connor learns about life the hard way.Well-acted, and triumphant in portrayal, A Monster Calls is the first gem of 2017 in my eyes. Lewis MacDougall is a star-in-the-making, and with Felicity Jones, Sigourney Weaver and Liam Neeson all contributing, you can be assured that there's no lack of empathy. J. A. Bayona also provides enrapturing imagery, that is both poetic and symbolic of the mind of a child - one of eccentricity and originality. It's only deterrent, I suppose, is how bloody sad it is. By the end, you can guarantee you will be short of tissues, but also by the end, the story has made its mark on our perception. There's no harm in speaking the truth, because that is the reality."
" Apart from the climax it's an average film.....
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,6,"Having gone to see the film on the recommendation of two renowned film critics, I just had to share my review. This film is not a classic and is nothing like or even close to the beauty, fantasy or story of Pan's Labyrinth which has been a comparison.There are other monster, dragon, fantasy films that are much better.Apart from the last 30 minutes which are admittedly very well acted, tearful and sad, most of the film is a disappointment losing it's story line and identity along the way. The child actor is good but the rest do not not engender warmth into their characters. In short it is a film that does not worthy it's current 7.8 rating."
" Very Disappointing
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,2,"I am a cry baby and was led to believe this was a tearjerker. I didn't cry once. The acting was ordinary. the dialogue weakthe story has no warmth taking into account the topic it was dealing with.It left no imprint on me at all and I wish I hadn't wasted my money.Is there no one else in the acting world that can do a deep husky voice other Liam Neeson. While I watched a kept thinking I was in Narnia and there would talking animal which would save this awful film.I was so bored that started to look to see if the monster had ""tackle"" much like football fan do a Mexican wave when they are bored with the game they are watching.He didn't have tackle... mores the pity"
" New, Unique and Compelling. Moved me to Tears.
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"This film is just amazing! The monster is very realistic, the plot is new, unique and compelling, and the movie moved me to tears. This is an adapted story from the award-winning novel. The story begins when Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) meets a monster (Liam Neeson) during what Conor thinks is a dream. Conor already has enough on his plate with bullies at his school, his mother's (Felicity Jones) illness and the pressure that his grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) will take him away from his mother. Plus, Conor's father is living far away where he cannot support his child through the mental and physical challenges that he is undergoing.Lewis MacDougall portrays Conor O'Malley extremely well. He draws the audience into his world and really makes them experience his pain. The way that MacDougall shows how Conor loves his mother and doesn't want her to go makes everyone feel heartbroken. MacDougall pulls you in with his great acting skills that make this film enjoyable as your mood swings form tears of joy to extreme sadness throughout the whole movie. The monster's appearance looks extremely realistic. The monster's body is very detailed with multiple branches sticking out of it and you see the branches grow and entangle everything they come across. I also love the sound effects. Whenever the monster wakes up and comes out of the ground, the sound of breaking branches and his growl are very realistic which make him seem completely real. My favorite part of the movie is when Conor and his mother are together in his mother's final moments and the monster is there watching over them. It is really touching to see them together, but sorrowful at the same time because, you know that the mother has to go. It really moved me seeing how much they love each other.The message of this story is that you have to learn to face the truth and accept it. You can't hide from your problems and expect them to go away. You must accept the truth. You have to be strong and learn to let go and move on. This movie is really spectacular and riveting. I give it 5 out of 5 monster stars. I recommend it for ages 12 to 18. There is too much drama and death for younger viewers. You can find this movie in theaters now. It is truly wonderful and you should definitely check it out.Reviewed by Jolleen M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org."
" I absolutely loved this movie.
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,10,"I cant express how much I loved this movie properly. The mystery, the story line and the creativity that has created this world is absolutely heart-breakingly beautiful. Having loved the book I had high expectations for the movie, and oh boy were they met. This is not the film to watch if you're not in the mood for a few tears, but gosh are those tears worth it. I highly recommend it to anyone. Its a relationship between a boy and his mother- and how he has had to grow up too fast.I truly don't understand why this film is not everywhere winning every award there is. So So SO good!"
" Once they referenced Pan's Labyrinth it was always going to be a disappointment
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,6,"I had a bit of a dilemma at the cinema last week ... go and see Felicity Jones get ill and die in A Monster Calls, or go for some escapist nonsense instead. It was a grey miserable January day, so La La Land won. But I did catch A Monster Calls later, and, while I blubbed like a good proportion of the audience (and even - apparently - hardened critics), the overwhelming feeling was one of disappointment. Just because it has a Spanish director and elements of magic, it is futile to compare this film with Pan's Labyrinth. I felt the plot was one-dimensional, the tree special effects so-so, Liam Neeson's treated voice just plain annoying, and the script was average. Even the close-up watercolour graphics which were so beautiful at one stage never repeated that wonderful visual treat. The great Sigourney Weaver was horribly mis-cast and given a pretty awful script. The only actors who came out of this really well were Felicity Jones, who was affecting throughout and had emotional kick, and the young lead Lewis MacDougall who did everything with his face that the script didn't allow him to do with his words."
" Weirdly Christophobic and Underdeveloped
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,6,"""A Monster Calls"" is a weirdly, distastefully Christophobic film.Conor, an adorable little English boy (Lewis MacDougall) is very sad because he is bullied in school and his mother has cancer. His father lives in LA and is married to someone else and has another child. His grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) appears cold and controlling. Conor is artistic and he likes to escape from his sad life by drawing. One night, Conor is visited by a talking tree (Liam Neeson). The tree promises to tell Conor stories that will help him with the burdens he faces in life. That's pretty much all that happens in the film. The film doesn't go deep into the pain a child feels when he watches his mother go from being a bit pale to being bedridden and bald. It doesn't do much of anything with Conor's heartbreaking relationship with his absentee father. It doesn't delve into the complexities of bullying. Why do the bullies behave so badly? How can bullied kids change their situation? The film doesn't even ask these questions, never mind answer them. The film doesn't explore or articulate Conor's relationship to art. Conor is at the age when romantic love first rears its head. Conor cuddles in bed with his mom, but he doesn't seem to see or be seen by any romantic prospects. The talking tree promises to tell Conor stories that will help him in life. The stories are animated and narrated by Neeson. The animation is lovely. It is pen and ink and watercolor. The watercolor splashes colorfully across the screen. The thing is, the tree's stories suck. They are boring and pointless. There isn't much going on in this movie, and the stories, which are promised to be profound, are just painful to listen to. I did cry watching this movie. I think you'd have to have a heart of stone not to cry watching a lad deal with such depressing life circumstances. But the film is so underdeveloped that I left the theater feeling unsatisfied. The one thing the movie does do and does with great efficiency. The film bashes Christianity. Watching this movie, I had to ask myself, what is going on in England? Why does England hate Christianity so much? Why are Christophobic themes so prominent in English films, from the creepy clergyman Mr. Collins in every new iteration of ""Pride and Prejudice"" to this film, which opens with a scene of a church crumbling into the earth? One of the stories the tree tells is about a bad bad bad bad English clergyman, maybe even as bad as Mr. Collins, who is disrespectful to an herbal healer. I mean, come on. The herbal healer gets revenge against the bad clergyman in a really vicious way, and the film celebrates that. To make everything crystal clear, in the animated portion, the clergyman is shown with a giant white cross on his bad bad very bad no good chest. This film creeped me out. It uses the most poignant of life circumstances to bash Christianity. How exploitative and nasty. On the plus side: Young actor Lewis MacDougall is beyond spectacular in this role. He gives one of the great child actor performances of all time. This kid, I hope, is going places."
" A Grimm Tale Indeed
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"￼(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A visually stunner caught up in the undergrowth of its own conventional storytelling.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: A child suffers the harsh realities of life and retreats to another world.JIM'S REVIEW: J. A. Bayona's A Monster Calls is a visually imaginative downer of a tale about a young boy who must learn to cope with grief. Based on the award-winning children's book by Patrick Ness and adapted by the author himself, the film uses animation and live action to tell its tale of woe. The results of this dark tale are enlightened by stylish direction and a highly effective performance by newcomer. Lewis MacDougall.Mr. MacDougall plays Conor O'Malley whose life is filled with too many harsh realities: a mother suffering from terminal cancer (Felicity Jones), a distant grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) and a more distant father (Toby Kebbell), a cruel bully (James Melville). Real life offers no solitude, so Conor retreats to an imaginary world which brings with it a giant yew monster (Liam Neeson). During his visits, the tree creature provides some respite for Conor. He gives him sage advice by telling some stories to help this child through the darkness to find some solace in the real world. ￼A Monster Calls is more of an allegory and the film's narrative structure uses the format of interspersing animated vignettes as parables to the parallel story of Conor and his terminally-ill mother. Yes, the film is manipulative from the start, with its undeniable melodramatic set-up and ultimately tragic conclusion. The real world story is dull and so relentless in its brooding melancholia compared to the free-spirited other worldly realm and, at times, this reviewer wanted to stay in the latter. But the filmmakers treat their serious subject with such dignity and honesty, avoiding the maudlin and sentimental for the most part. There is so much to admire about Mr. Bayona's film. (The subject is not an easy task to sell to the general public. Not surprisingly, the movie is doing lackluster business in the States, although globally it is doing well. Nowadays, American moviegoers are looking to escape reality, such like the main character.)Technically, the film soars. From Oscar Fuura's stunning photography to Fernando Velazquez's haunting music score, the film looks death squarely in the face and celebrates life. Seamlessly edited by Benat Vilplana and Jaume Marti, A Monster Calls uses its sumptuous visuals to its advantage. With swirls of bright watercolor washes adding a vibrancy to the film's story-within- a story format, the film efficiently contrasts the real from the unreal. Kudos to director Bayona and his team of artisans on their handling of this delicate theme.The lead performances are all first-rate, Mr. Neeson voices the Monster perfectly and his motion capture performance is wonderful and so heartfelt. Ms. Jones brings superb understatement to her role as Conor's sickly parent. Her chemistry with Mr. MacDougall seems genuine and authentic. This young actor, in his film debut, is remarkable and runs the full gamut of emotions without one false note. Providing supporting work in their rather stock roles are Ms. Weaver and Mr. Kebbell who are merely serviceable, possibly due to the writing and characters.￼A Monster Calls is indeed a Grimm tale, but one that deserves your attention. And be forewarned, bring a hankie with you."

" A fairy tale film of imagination, hope, fear, anger, and truth.

Well these themes are present with this picture ""A Monster Calls"" plus it's combined and blended with imagination, anger and fear and it shows how a fairy tale can compare and contrast with reality and the truth. The movie stars Lewis MacDougall as Conor a young little timid shy boy who's bullied and picked on at school plus he's from a broken home and to make matters worse his mom(Felicity Jones)is dying from terminal cancer and to go along with that his only support is that of his tough and cold distant grandmother(the still elegant and attractive sexy Sigourney Weaver). So what now well enter the escape and nightmare drama of a tree monster(the voice of the great Liam Neeson)outside his bedroom window who appears every night at 12:07 AM to tell tales the tree will tell a trio, and these stories are wild and wicked with witches, kings, princess, castles, and death all fables of moral lessons(a mix of ""The Wizard of Oz"", and ""Game of Thornes""). With the deal being for Conor to tell the 4th and final one and it must be something of the truth. It seems as if these stories from the tree monster never wrap and Conor sees them as a take that life is never happy and he feels that as a comparison to his mom's terminal cancer. Overall this film shows how life and grief can be faced thru the form of a fairy tale showing that emotions all can be tied up in forms of imagination, fear, and anger which all lead to the truth."
" ""A Monster Calls"" is an original, dark, beautiful, entertaining and even therapeutic film.
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"In 2016's dark fantasy drama ""A Monster Calls"" (PG-13, 1:48), the titular creature is a European yew tree which takes on human form when summoned by a person or when needed to perform some necessary function. That type of tree turns out to be an especially good choice for a monster – especially in this story. Yew trees are very large, some reaching a height of 100 feet and a trunk diameter of 20 feet. For centuries, the yew tree has been planted in church yards, due to the symbolic significance of its longevity. The yew's leaves are poisonous, but elements of the bark have been used effectively in the treatment of cancer. As you are about to read, all of this plays into the original story told in this movie.Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall, from 2015's ""Pan"") is a very troubled 12-year-old. He is bullied by his classmates in his British prep school, especially by a boy named Harry (James Melville), who physically and emotionally abuses the lad on a regular basis. Conor's parents are divorced and his father (Toby Kebbell) moved to Los Angeles and started a new family. Conor's grandmother (multiple Oscar nominee Sigourney Weaver) is strict and cold, but Conor is forced to spend more time with her due to the illness of Conor's mother, Lizzie (Oscar nominee Felicity Jones), who has an unspecified cancer.As his mother's health continues to decline, Conor begins receiving visits from an anthropomorphic yew tree which Conor can see from his bedroom window in the church yard across a small valley. The tree appears to Conor as a monster (voiced and played by way of motion-capture animation by Oscar nominee Liam Neeson), but Conor is not afraid. The tree claims that Conor has summoned him and that the monster will continue to visit Conor until the purpose for which he was summoned is fulfilled. The monster will tell Conor three true stories from long ago and then Conor will have to tell the monster the story of Conor's recurring nightmare, which is supposed to reveal a truth that Conor is unable to admit.The monster's stories take the form of fables and appear on the screen as simple but beautiful animated sequences. They involve a prince and his stepmother vying for the throne of their kingdom, a parson who preaches against an old apothecary until he needs the apothecary's help and, lastly, an invisible man. The stories are all symbolic of people or circumstances in Conor's life, but he is initially unable to understand their relevance – or their endings, which are unexpected and disturbing to the young man. Yet, each story brings Conor closer to coming to terms with what is happening in his family – and to having to talk about his haunting nightmare and the truth it reveals, which Conor resists vehemently.""A Monster Calls"" is an original, tragic and beautiful film. MacDougall gives an especially strong and affecting performance in a year full of extraordinary performances by child and teen actors. The various forms of animation all have a raw beauty to them and are very effective at conveying tone and mood. Although the ways that the adults in Conor's life react to the trouble he gets into while expressing his inner turmoil are unrealistically muted, the script (by Patrick Ness, adapting his novel based on a story idea by the late author Siobhan Dowd) is creative and feels authentic. J. A. Bayona's direction is appropriately dark and sensitive. This film works well as entertainment – and as therapy for someone dealing with the illness of a loved one. ""A-"""

" A Monster Calls ShowMeTheMovies Review
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,8,"Originally the brainchild of Siobhan Dowd, and beautifully finished by Patrick Ness, A Monster Calls' on-screen adaptation hits all the right notes.When it comes to writing a children's book about dark themes such as a bullied 13-year old's attempts to deal with an overbearing grandmother, absent father, and his mother's battle with cancer, Patrick Ness must have had his work cut out when trying to set a suitable tone. When this is then transferred to a movie adaptation, with so many factors to consider like the score, animation and dialogue - you have an incredibly difficult task from the start in moulding to your target audience and remaining consistent without viewing as too dark or too edgy.The solution that A Monster Calls attempts is the best of both worlds; maintaining a touching tale of loss and hope for the future, yet sliding in themes that children will be able to digest - though sometimes panning out as cliché.The story focuses on schoolboy Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) and his brief relationship with an imaginary monster; whose purpose it is to help Conor learn to deal with the issues he faces by telling him three tales - provided that Conor tell the monster a tale of truth in return. The Monster (voiced by Liam Neeson), originating from a yew tree near Conor's home during the opening act, is, at first glance, reminiscent of Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy; though with far more vocabulary and an even shorter fuse.From an aesthetic standpoint, the animation of The Monster is indeed a spectacle - not to mention a certain scene which is featured in the trailer of the film with a collapsing graveyard, where the CGI is top notch again. Naturally it is not a huge sci-fi blockbuster-level phenomenon, as the film is clearly created with a modest budget, but at the same time, A Monster Calls manages to supply the viewer with enough to please the eyes. During the times the Monster is telling his tales, 2D animation illustrates the story as it is told; the animation is a good break from the main story and I found myself always looking forward to his next - even though the third was incredibly short and fit in to the main story rather than having its own sequence, to my disappointment.As far as sound design and score goes, there isn't too much to note other than one dramatic moment where all sound stops completely which was pulled off perfectly; the soundtrack wasn't particularly memorable at all on its own, but it did work well tied into the film, so standard enough.The performances of the main cast are more than worth a mention, particularly considering what was managed with quite a limited number of performers. Lewis MacDougall certainly suited the role of Conor very well, a commending performance from a young actor with a good knowledge of his field. While I can't say the performance was quite exceptional, MacDougall did make Conor relatable in how he responded to different situations throughout the film, an example being how frustrated he gets when The Monster tells seemingly irrelevant tales to Conor's situation. Liam Neeson was a perfect choice for The Monster, who projected and dragged out his words so that he sounded how we'd imagine a gigantic tree-monster to sound, to the point that there were moments The Monster didn't even sound like Neeson at all; an incredibly immersive presentation.Furthermore, acting from Felicity Jones and Sigourney Weaver were near-perfect - Jones (Conor's mother) portrayed a very realistic mother/son bond; with Weaver playing the grandmother of Conor (an excellent casting choice), superbly displaying a particularly powerful moment during the film when she loses one of her prized possessions.The lapses in immersion and writing quality came in only two forms - one with the cliché bullies that torment Conor at school:- there are three of them, they have a 'leader bully' and that specific bully eventually gets a form of comeuppance- it sounds even less original when I describe it.These bullies have no real motivation to consistently distress Conor whatsoever, and whilst the revealed reason Conor puts up with their teasing is incredibly moving, the actual point of the bullies simply felt like a plot mechanic, rather than fully fleshed out characters making a meaningful appearance. The other issue I would raise is that Conor is essentially correct about The Monster's stories, that they are completely irrelevant to the main story in this film; I found myself waiting for the moment that The Monster would explain how all his tales tied into the problems Conor was facing - however that moment never really came.Overall, A Monster Calls is a great movie, and one I would certainly recommend - but do expect to be leaving the film in a far worse mood than you walked in with; it deals with some depressing themes and children with a firm understanding of the plot will likely be in tears.8/10"
" The type of film I probably really would have enjoyed as a kid, but it is slow-building.
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"'A MONSTER CALLS': Four Stars (Out of Five)A fantasy drama about a young boy that's trying to cope with his mother's terminal illness, by imagining a tree monster that continues to visit him and tell him stories. It was directed by J.A. Bayona (who also helmed the 2007 supernatural horror flick 'THE ORPHANAGE', and the 2012 disaster flick 'THE IMPOSSIBLE'), and it was scripted by first time screenwriter Patrick Ness (it's also based on his 2011 children's novel, of the same name). The movie stars Lewis MacDougall, Felicity Jones (of 'ROGUE ONE' fame), Sigourney Weaver, Toby Kebbell and the voice of Liam Neeson. The film received mostly rave reviews from critics, and it's also been nominated for multiple respectable awards. I found it to be a very slow-building, but emotionally powerful coming-of-age tale. Conor O'Malley (MacDougall) is a young boy that's struggling to deal with his mother's (Jones) terminal illness. His father (Kebbell) left them some time ago, and his grandmother (Weaver) is extremely strict and unfriendly towards Conor (but she does love him, and his mother, very much). Conor is also severely bullied at school. In order to try and deal with his problems, Conor imagines a tree monster (voiced by Neeson) that continues to visit him and tell him dark stories. The stories contain valuable life lessons, intended to help Conor deal with his problems (even though they're often very confusing as well). The film has some pretty cool visual effects in it, and they couldn't have cast a better voice actor than Liam Neeson (especially as a friendly, but very scary, tree monster). Jones and Weaver also both give outstanding performances in the movie as well, like they always do, and MacDougall especially shines in the lead. He's very convincing, as an extremely emotional, and very passionate, young boy! Bayona is definitely a talented director as well, and the script is pretty well written. It's a great coming-of-age tale, but I wouldn't recommend it for children of all ages (really young ones will probably be bothered by it). It's the type of film I probably really would have enjoyed as a kid, even though it is (like I already said) extremely slow- building.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc"
" A Monster Calls
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,6,"I saw the trailer for this film, based on the popular children's novel, a month or two before its release, and I saw it reviewed on TV, it looked like something I may enjoy, directed by J.A. Bayona (The Orphanage, The Impossible). Basically 12-year-old Conor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) is struggling with life, his mother (Felicity Jones) has terminal cancer, his grandmother (Sigourney Weaver) is being strict, his estranged father (Toby Kebbell) has returned in an attempt to reconnect, and he is being severely bullied at his local school by Harry (James Melville). One night, seven minutes after midnight, Conor encounters a giant tree-like Monster (Liam Neeson), it tells the boy he will tell him three true stories, after which Conor must tell him his own story, the truth behind the nightmare he has had many times. The Monster continues to meet Conor, almost always at 12:07 AM or PM, to tell these stories, all of which involve the Monster being summoned, Conor reluctantly allows him to tell them, but sees no point or reason for him doing so, he does not see how it helps him. The first story: an old kind losing his family and marrying a beautiful woman, he dies and she becomes queen, the prince refuses to marry her and runs away to marry a farm girl, she is murdered, the prince believes the queen did it and is a witch, the Monster awakes and joins the mob, she was indeed a witch, but the prince was evil, the Monster saved the queen. The second story: an apothecary (medical pharmacist) has his business go down when a local parson intervenes, the parson's own two daughters become sick and begs the apothecary to help, he says he will allow the apothecary access to the yew tree and its healing ingredients and to revoke his beliefs if his daughters will be saved, but the apothecary refuses, the Monster punished the parson for his actions, as he was willing to sacrifice his beliefs, the apothecary stayed with his beliefs to work and to heal. The third story, a short one: there was a man who was invisible as no one ever saw him, tired of this he summoned the Monster to make people take notice of him, the people looked, but they saw something wretched. Conor will not accept that his mother cannot be saved, ultimately he is forced to face up to his nightmare, he does not want his mother to die, but he must learn that it is inevitable and something he must accept. Conor tells the fourth and final story, the truth about his nightmare: his mother is pulled to the edge of a cliff when the ground collapses, Conor grabs his mother's hand to save her from the pit below, his grip fails and his mother falls, but the Monster forces him to confess that he did this on purpose, he could have held on longer, but he let go to end his pain of holding on. In the end, with the Monster by his side, Conor returns to reality, comforts his mother in her final moments, she dies at seven minutes past midnight, he returns home with his grandmother and gets his own room, where he finds his mother's old sketchbook, in which she drew pictures of the characters from the stories, and of herself as a child with the Monster. Also starring Geraldine Chaplin as The Head Teacher, Jennifer Lim as Miss Kwan, Ben Moor as Mr. Clark and Oliver Steer as Sully. MacDougall gives a compelling performance as the boy forced to face up to the inevitable, Weaver does her best with the English accent but is certainly good at being cold, Jones is suitably sympathetic with her ailment, and Neeson is a great choice as the dark yew tree come to life who is supportive. I found out bits and pieces of what the story involved, and may have had a predictable spoiler alert given away slightly, but it didn't mean I wasn't swept away, the plot is clever, the stories told are interesting, the themes of grief and acceptance work very well, and the special effects and animation techniques are fantastic, it is a sad story but worthwhile, an emotional and watchable dark fantasy drama. Good!"
" 6/10 Superb acting by Lewis MacDougall
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,6,"Let's start with the positives ; huge praise has to go to Lewis MacDougall his acting was superb. Relationships between his character , his mother , father and grand mother develop over the film but really get to the point that you feel engaged enough, enough to invest the emotion in the subject matter , it's only in the final minutes of the film that you're able to connect the dots . I found this element a shame I would have preferred to have been emotionally drawn in earlier . Prior to that the only relationship you feel engaged with is the tree and Conor but that isn't enough to draw you into the film taking into account the subject matter. Having not read the book I can't comment on it's transition but the back story intrigues me as this is an extremely personal piece of work posthumously completed by Patrick Ness from an idea by authoress Siobhan Dowd who sadly died of cancer before she could complete the book. From a purely commercial point of view I'm surprised ,though grateful , it stayed true to the book and was filmed in the U.K. , A huge gamble on a $40m budget ( particularly as it's a US/Spanish production) perhaps why it flopped in the US? The story could have easily been transformed to Ireland but I'm guessing with the success of Harry Potter , the U.K. is now a safe bet for middle budget fantasy movies . That leads me to the CGI which was excellent and fitted seamlessly into the live action. Liam Neeson was an excellent piece of casting . I had expected to enjoy the film more , I expected to be drawn in to the subject but found myself sad but not sad enough to feel engaged . I didn't come away thinking I've got to tell everyone to see this film and that's where it failed . It's not a bad film just not a great film. If it was a School report i'd say 'Could do better'! Peter Jackson would have been a better choice of director."
" Not a super faithful adaptation, but a good movie nonetheless
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,6,"I am writing this literally the second since I finished the book. Yes, I read the book after I watched the movie. So sue me. But after that last page, I gotta say... the book does it better.Don't get me wrong, emotional moments are much more powerful when you see them in the cinema. In a book you have to leave your imagination to fill in the blanks, like how the characters look during the moment, or how the place looks should it not be given enough detail. In a film, you can see all that is going on, and usually there's some depressing music in the background to make it twice as saddening. This is why I nearly cried during the film and not during the book (apart from the fact that I read the book last and already knew what was going to happen). The movie is shot very well, and the emotional highlights are so well done it leaves you floored.Another positive is that they didn't break the great story and moments of the book. Any moment of significance to the characters or any story told by the monster is engaging and emotional. The stories told by the monster are beautifully animated and well told. It's not just Conor (the main character) being told the story, it's him being immersed in the monster's tale. These stories are honestly the best parts of both the book and the movie, as well as the ending. The ending is depressing and at the same time uplifting, just like the message of the movie, holding on while letting go.However, just because a film can do certain things better than a book doesn't mean it can do everything better than a book. For one thing, the movie added in a bunch of new ideas that weren't in the original book, and sadly these new ideas are just not made for the idea and theme of the thing it's trying to be an adaptation of. For example, after the ending (or at least the ending in the book), another scene plays where Conor gets a new room from his Grandma (Sigourney Weaver, a pretty good actor for this role to be fair), and in the room it's revealed that the grandfather of Conor taught his mother the tales of the monster, who then taught them to Conor. Did Conor have a grandfather in the book? No, but even in the movie it's mentioned once and never brought up again. What was so wrong about leaving it on the powerful ending of the book? That it was too sad for the kids in the audience? No parent would take their kid to see this to begin with!Another big issue I had was that the film explained rather than showed. This problem existed in the book as well, but to a lesser extent as books are meant to do that. Films shouldn't just say what's going on, they should show the audience these things. They shouldn't just flat out state that certain things aren't as they are being portrayed, they should show us these things. This is why certain scenes in the book worked the way they did, like the nightmare scene close to the end. But this is also why it doesn't work in the movie. In the book they never reveal what the nightmare is, and when it does show up, they establish what needed to be established. In the movie, it's literally the first scene, is repeated at least twice from then, and when it comes back towards the end, we already know what it means for him.There were a few other problems I didn't cover for the sake of focus, but ultimately I do think the book did the story and message a bit better than the movie. Some scenes are worth checking out and I most certainly think this is worth the price of admission, but if you want an even more depressing story, please read the book."
" The most moving film of 2016!
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"A Monster Calls comes out of nowhere hits you with something that will leave you pondering it for days after the credits roll. The emotion in this film is very real, and it is brought out through the performances. In particular the performance of Lewis MacDougall, who plays Conner, a child trying to figure out how to fight through an awful illness that comes upon his mother played touchingly by Felicity Jones. MacDougall takes the audience on this heartbreaking journey with him. His performance was the most striking, emotional, and best of 2016. While watching A Monster Calls, you truly feel all of the struggles and emotions that Conner goes through. You get a feeling of dread that builds and builds throughout the film along with welling eyes and lumps in your throat. This movie accomplishes what it goes for, in that it makes the viewer FEEL. The emotions in this film are something that I haven't experienced since ""The Green Mile"". I believe this is one of those rare films that everybody should see, just make sure you come prepared with some tissues."
" See it while you still can!
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,10,"I went to see ""A Monster Calls"" earlier today, expecting a good movie, and instead found one that was amazing to watch. Below is a quick description of how the movie starts out, with some comments following.The movie opens with a nightmare, apparently a recurring one, which Connor O'Malley (Lewis MacDougall) has. In it his mother (Felicity Jones) is falling into a pit, and he is holding on to her to save her life, but ultimately she falls to her death. It is a terrifying dream for him, but scarcely less terrifying than some other aspects of his life; including dealing with his mother's losing battle with cancer.A monster (voice wonderfully by Liam Neeson) comes to visit him and while somewhat terrifying it simply says it will visit four more times, telling a story each time, and the fourth time listening to the true story of Connor's nightmare. In between visits we learn more about Connor's life, including his absentee dad (Toby Kebbell), his grandmother (Sigourney Weaver), and some difficulties he has with bullies at school. Not wanting to spoil the movie, I will not give away any further details. However, suffice it to say that the true enemy Connor battles is not the monster, but much more real life issues.As the story goes on I found myself rapidly drawn in, and immersed in Connor's point of view, while as an adult still able to see things he did not, but in a way that did not distract from the story. Connor as the movie states is ""too old to be a child, and too young to be a man"", yet he finds himself face to face with sorrow and loss that is deep. The story uses the monster, his stories, and Connor's life as a moving example of dealing with loss and finding a measure of triumph in the midst of it. I rarely cry at any movie, but the ending of this one had my eyes moist with tears.The acting is excellent, the special effects well done and not distracting, and the story deeply moving and engaging. The movie is a strange mix, since it is really a drama, and a well done one at that, but the title, age of the protagonist, and the partially animated sequences (for the monster's stories) might make some think it is a children's movie, which it is not. I suspect this, and a lack of effective marketing, might make the box office poor for this movie, a pity since it one of the best I have seen in a long time.I watched the movie alone as I often do at first, but plan to return next week with the rest of my family to share it with them. Given the less than spectacular box office I suggest if you have not seen this movie you plan to do so ASAP while you still can."
" The Simplest Truth Will Set You Free
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,10,"""A Monster Calls"" surrenders to our truths. When we do so, we set ourselves free. Liam Neeson as the Monster tells Lewis MacDougall's young Conor, ""Speak the simplest truth."" Hold on tight to those you love, while letting go. MacDougall and Neeson are amazing grace in Director J.A. Bayona's ""A Monster Calls"". ""A Monster Calls"" is about the serenity of acceptance. At a telling point in the story, Conor confesses to the Monster, ""I'm afraid."" He says, ""You should be"" It is all right to be afraid. It is all right to just be. That is the beauty of ""A Monster Calls"". In the opening scene Conor awakes from a recurrent nightmare as he loses grasp of his Mum's hands and she falls into the dark abyss. Set in England, 12 year-old Conor (MacDougall) selflessly cares for himself and his Mum (Felicity Jones), who seems to suffer from terminal cancer. He is terrified of what's next. He endures physical and verbal abuses from school bully Harry (a good James Melville). Conor's only escape derives from his drawings and watercolor paintings. One night, a behemoth Monster (voiced by Neeson) arises from the yew tree on the hill. The Monster will tell Conor three stories. Then Conor must tell the fourth story— his own truth. Patrick Ness wrote the screenplay based on his novel. Renowned children's author Siobhan Dowd originated the idea that inspired his novel. Bayona and Ness miraculously weave their story with gorgeous tapestries of animation, watercolor, and live action. The Monster narrates the story of: ""A boy too old to be a kid. Too young to be a man."" MacDougall breaks our hearts as Conor, a boy who has lost his smile. The Monster is the austere rooted sinuous beast towering over Conor. Neeson voices him with fierce benevolence and ruthless compassion. He tells Conor that there are no good guys; there are no bad guys. Maybe we are all somewhere between. Neeson and MacDougall's profound partnership in ""A Monster Calls"" poignantly resonates. Felicity Jones as Conor's Mom Lizzy appears gaunt and frail, but she embodies her bold spirit. Lizzy's last recourse is an experimental treatment at the hospital. Grandma (seemingly rigid Sigourney Weaver) must care for Conor at her home. He would rather not. His Dad (compassionate Toby Kebbell), who lives in Los Angeles with his new family, visits Conor and his Mum. There is a singular smile when Conor sees him. The reason of his visit is direr. He tells Conor that he needs to be brave. School bullies constantly plague Conor. Now what does the Monster want of him? And what is Conor's own story? Director Bayona creates the eloquently stunning imagery of the Monster's stories. Neeson's voice punctuates the gravitas and paradox of the tales. The movie is a visual masterpiece. The heart of the story comes from the powerful performances. Felicity Jones as Mum is unconditional love. She tells Conor, ""I wish I could give you a 100 years."" I was in tears, and often throughout the movie. Kebbell is valiant as Conor's estranged Dad, vulnerable and doing his very best. Sigourney Weaver is a surprise. Her Grandma is not what she seems. Her humanity touches. MacDougall and Neeson are amazing and inspired. MacDougall evokes this radiant soul in sadness, pain, and anger. When he hugs his Mum— you know what is in his heart. Neeson voices the Monster as both ominous and gently compassionate. He tells Conor that he'll be with him, and the world is safe. Everything will be all right. Bayona beautifully ties together his story. In the end everything makes sense, as if it were our own truth as well. ""A Monster Calls"" will make you cry and smile from your soul. It is an awesome movie. It may make you think about your own truth. ""A Monster Calls"" is about your simplest truth setting you free."
" Like an true nightmare, A Monster Calls has a lot of dark beauty within it's tragedy
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"The traces of crayon and markers on paper will tell you a lot of thing you need to know about the child that drew it. You'd be surprised by how much a drawing of a horse or a sloppy house can tell what any kid would like. I remember during the third grade, my teacher noted several sketches I've done of space aliens and flying pizzas invading over an unnamed city. She actually asked if this was supposed to be about a fear of meeting new people and by going back to a slice of cheese pizza, I was ignoring new things. I only said that I liked aliens and pizza.As I've said, drawings may not always say a lot, but they do something. It depends on the person and the emotions their going through. I can only interpret that my crude sketch only said that I was board and would rather make up something weird to pass the time. My friend too did his own drawings, but his were a lot darker. Whenever I asked, he simply said, ""their just cool"", despite that their darker imagery frightened me. It would be several years later when I found out that his father had passed away. Perhaps A Monster Calls reflects perfectly well what my friend went through.Twelve-year-old Conner O'Malley (played by Lewis MacDougall) loves his mother and does his best to care for her, given her terminal illness and his determination to see her get better. His mother Lizzie (played by Felicity Jones) has told her son several stories and encouraged his artistic talent. His grandmother (played by Sigourney Weaver) also does her best to tend to her daughter and grandson, even though Conner see's her as something of an unsympathetic witch. On top of that, Conner is also the target of a bully.One evening at the strike of 12:07, he sees a giant, tree-like creature rise out of a church graveyard and comes to the boy's house. The monster (voiced by Liam Neeson) tells Conner that he'll tell him three stories and that when the time comes, a fourth must be given in return. Though Conner see's this creature in a reoccurring nightmare, he shows no fear, probably due to his early maturity. In conjunction with the Monster's visits, Conner's grandmother and father (played by Toby Kebbell) come to realize that Lizzie may not make it much longer. Conner allows the monster to tell him the stories, with the hope that his mother can be saved. When I was watching A Monster Calls, I was surprised by how much it made me think about Where The Wild Things Are. Not because their similar movies, but because their both family oriented movies that feel very mature and adult. This is what I like about A Monster Calls. Like a lot of nightmares one would have, the visions that the child has of the monster (which is cool looking, though he looks similar to Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy) connect incredibly well to the events that he's going through. It's a master class of great screen writing and editing.A Monster Calls will defiantly feel heavy to a lot of kids that are going to see this. Their going find themselves watching something sad, but I hope that parents see this as important. Lewis MacDougall manages to carry a lot of the heavy emotions that the story requires of him and pulls off a performance that's better then a lot of adult actors. As an audience member, I wanted to see where his story was going to go and was sad to see it end. You know a movie is good when your sad that it ended.I'll give this ten sketches of the monster out of ten. I can't stress with how beautiful this movie is. It's full of story that should help a lot of people going through with someone's terminal illness or their own. I can only say that this is geared towards older kids (probably over the age of ten would be best) and I doubt that they won't get something out of this.

" So disappointing...
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"The worst movie I've ever seen. 1) Everything else was stunning and gorgeous and well executed, but... Seems like the administration fired all their screenwriters and decided to write all dialogue themselves. The acting is great, but the dialogue, especially with the tree monster, has so little depth and sentiment and originality, that it is not believable at all. This movie is like ""The Room"" or ""Trolls 2"" except it takes itself more seriously and is otherwise well done. Very very disappointing. 2) I feel people are afraid to give it a bad rating because it is about cancer and family suffering. But, the movie actually did not give enough respect to victims of cancer or bullying because they put so little effort into the actual story. It had so much potential. We need to admit and speak the truth, people, instead of just trying to be likable, otherwise not only a movie will lack substance, but so will our lives and our world.My date agreed 110%, and the people in the movie theater did not seem pleased either. So it can't just be me. Stop giving this good reviews just to seem like good people!!!"
" An epic emotional film
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"I heard allot of great buzz about this film so I have now seen a monster calls and I loved this film and it is one of the best made movies I have seen in a few years. The premise of this film sees a young boy seek the help of a tree monster to help him deal with his mother's terminal illness. Lewis MacDougall plays the young boy in this film and this is a kid to watch out for as this is one of the best kid performances I have ever seen. He truly adds so much depth to his character and you really enjoyed end up sympathising with him because he is such a relatable character to anybody really. Felicity Jones fresh of playing jyn erso in rogue one plays his mother in this film and she is brilliant in her role, it shows just how good an actress she is Because she has to totally flip her performance here. In rogue one she was a strong heroic action star and here she is a frail but strong character who has to deal with this illness and I liked the two's chemistry. Sigourney weaver plays the grandmother in this film and she does a really good job in the film, Her character progression was the best in the film as you end up caring about her too. Toby kebbell is a great actor who just hasn't had the best choice of roles as he does a really good job In this film as the dad in this film as I liked his relationship with MacDougall. Liam neeeson voices the monster in this film and he is the perfect voice for this great character. You feel his commanding presence with his booming voice and you really do see this relationship between the monster and conor (the boy) develop as the film progresses. The story of this film is really good and emotional as you see conor go through this turbulent time and deal with it in his own way which happens to deal with this tree monster. I liked how the monster was sparingly used and was used only when he was necessary and wasn't forced to hurt the emotional tone of this great narrative. The script is brilliant, there is obvious dramatic dialogue that I really well done, I will admit I came close to tears a few times towards the end of this film. For such a dramatic film it also has some well placed bits of humour in it as well. The style of this film is good, the CGI for the monster is incredible and the look of the film is great. There is some interesting use of water painting in the film but it looks pretty good and if you don't like it, it isn't in the film that much. Overall I loved this film and I hope this film gets the recognition it deserves."
" A Monstrously Moving Movie
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"This film focuses on a young boy, Conor, and his struggles to cope with his feelings in the face of his mother's terminal illness. Despite its 'monster' label and 12A certificate, this is emphatically not a kids movie. It is, in fact, a rather dark tale of emotional distress in the face of imminent death and the fantastic and frightening ways in which a young person responds to an appalling situation they can do nothing to avoid. Very young cinema-goers may well find it frightening and or incomprehensible.Various reviewers refer to the need to 'take plenty of tissues'. But this is no mawkish, sentimental tear-jerker. Rather this emotionally powerful film derives much of its potency from the wholly unsentimental treatment of the story, so producing a hard-edged drama yet one that nonetheless does indeed bring the viewer to tears.The acting from the main characters is uniformly superb but Lewis MacDougall (Conor) is exceptional, delivering what should be an award-winning performance. The fantasy sequences are also brilliantly rendered and one marvels at the artistry that has so successfully integrated sound, vision and story into one magnificent piece of cinema.If you go to see this movie you will not come away smiling, but you will feel that the time spent watching it has been time well spent.(Viewed at Screen 10, Odeon, Warrington, UK, 08 January 2017)"
" Lots of tears
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"So good. Followed the book generally well, a few changes here and there but nothing major. The only reason the rating isn't higher is because the first half felt a bit rushed which took away from the emotional impact. Although towards the end they slowed things down to make for a great finish. Liam Neeson was brilliant as the voice of the monster and I was thoroughly impressed with the acting done by Lewis MacDougall who played Connor O'Malley... that kid is going to go places. Loved the ending that they added, wasn't in the book but it gave the whole story a very well rounded conclusion by making it clear that the monster had previously visited the mother as well. I still enjoyed the book a little more but I suppose that will always be the case. All in all a very good movie with a very important message."
" Messily Ever After
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"Storytelling is the very reason that we have the medium of film. Everyone loves a good story, and they may re-telling even more. It's something that our species has done since the very beginning. A Monster Calls takes that love for storytelling and imports it into a heartbreakingly human tale about a boy losing his mother to cancer, and how his imagination can help him cope with this devastating situation.As I mentioned in my review for 'The Orphanage', J.A. Bayona does quite well at telling stories about the bond between a mother and her son. But unlike 'The Orphanage', 'A Monster Calls' deals more with the son's side of this relationship instead of the other way around. And although I think this may be Bayona's weakest film overall, there's no question that he has a serious future in this business. He has a knack for creating unbelievably human emotions out of his characters even in the most imaginative situations.The imagination of this film was another thing I really appreciated. It's not your typical cancer film, in fact, it hardly focuses on Felicity Jones' character who has cancer. We spend much more time with her son, played by newcomer Lewis MacDougall, and his imaginative tree monster friend, voiced by Liam Neeson. I love the way the monster looks and is physically represented in this film. It's him who has the film's best scenes, and most creative and visceral moments. As depressing as the subject matter is, Neeson's monster brings plenty of subtle humor and visually satisfying scenes.I think one of the problems this film faces is that it's utterly predictable. You pretty much know the direction that each of the characters are going from the beginning. Yes, Bayona's direction is unique in structure, but the story doesn't end up anywhere different than what I initially thought. Sometimes that doesn't bother me, but for some reason it did here.Overall, A Monster Calls is visually stunning, well-acted, and uniquely structured. So even though the plot ends up going exactly where you expect, there's enough under the surface to let the some of the mishaps slip by.+The monster steals the show+Beautiful cinematography+Bayona always nails human emotion-Disappointingly predictable7.6/10"
" An emotionally powerful experience
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"Synopsis:A boy seeks the help of a tree monster to cope with his single mum's terminal illness.A Monster Calls is a dark , moving and visually enthralling film that pulls no punches with its storytelling. In the wrong hands this film could have easily gone sideways or have ended up as a mess.Enter J.A.Bayona , who I have to say has done an outstanding job at the helm. He knows exactly how to seamlessly blend fantasy with reality and fully realize the scenes with The Monster with some great special effects that don't overpower the story that is being told.The acting was spot on from an ensemble that features Felicity Jones , Sigourney Weaver , Toby Kebbell and particularly Liam Neeson who brings grandeur to his performance as The Monster.However , it is Lewis MacDougall who steals the show as the unsettled protagonist.The film does become a bit over-sentimental towards the end but in this case it works because of the relatable characters who you grow to love in a genuinely heartfelt yet comforting story.A Monster Calls is a unique and creative fairy tale with a lot of heart.

" A Monster Calls Tears To The Eyes
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"Robbie K back again with another review. This time, as you can read from the site, we cover A Monster Calls, another novel based movie that may have flown under the radar for most of you viewers. Many reviews are calling it an unforgettable adventure and a new masterpiece for the ages, but the question always remains if the advertisements are true. So, let's dig up these roots and uncover the mystery of the tree monster as we review the latest film. LIKES:  The Acting  The Emotional Story  The Beautiful ArtworkA Monster Calls has many good elements about it, but the first like is the acting of both CGI and realistic characters. Lewis McDougall leads the way as Conor, and plays the isolated child with the weight of the world on his shoulder fantastically, especially in regards to the way he looks lost in his mind. Felicity Jones impresses me as well as the caring mother going through some very trying times. I can't tell how much is the look and how much is her ability portray suffering, but the woman's abilities continue to impress me. And Liam Neeson as the monster is a welcome addition, as his rugged voice is a perfect match for the design of the creature that somehow is filled with so much wisdom (hello flora version of Asland). Solid acting is a good start, but the story was even more captivating to me. A Monster Calls' plot is an emotional forest, filled to the brim with tear jerking sequences that will leave many faces wet. For me, it was because many of these problems are relatable, and were presented in that theatrical manner (e.g. using a powerful music score) that hits you from all fronts. And as the tale progresses, the suspense only continues to build and bring you into the story. But this isn't just necessarily a movie centered on entertaining you with drama, but once more tries to teach you lessons as the relationship between boy and monster begins to form. The tales that the Monster brings out are prime lessons in the error of perception, the folly of judgement, and the importance of empathy. These lessons aren't just randomly thrown in, but go along with the main story and help build to the conclusion. But my favorite aspect, as well as many reviewers', is the artwork of the movie. The real- life scenes contain beautiful settings, alongside the efficient use of filters to help add some subtle emotion to the scenes. Yeah, I know nothing special, right? Heck even the monster, despite how well animated and designed he is doesn't hit the super unique animation. However, what is impressive is the art styles used to portray the monster's lessons. Two of the tales use different animations styles to visualize the moral lessons, using brilliant colors, broad strokes, and warped figures to add a haunted twist to the normal fairy tales. The well-timed breaks from the mundane real life visuals helps add that whimsical side to the story and help reenergize the audience in this otherwise exhausting movie. DISLIKES:  Incredibly Sad Movie  Predictable Ending You don't want to see coming  Would have Liked the Third Story to Have the animation It is hard to find fault in this movie, because the movie is edited so well and feels like a visualization of a well-developed book. However, one big thing is the depressing cloud that looms over the entire movie. We all know movies that depress us, but most have those ray of hope moments that break the clouds of dismay. Not the case in this film. Despite some of the more colorful experiences shown in the trailers, A Monster Calls is not the fun loving, animated adventure you might think it is. It's a very sad film, and there are few moments to help distract you from what is to come. Yes, there is a massively predictable ending and one you wish wasn't the case. I can't say much more, but the ending (while adding suspense and tying things together) is something that teases at the back of your mind and further plays hacky sack with your emotions. A final, albeit minor dislike, is that I would have liked a third art style for the final story. While the third tale is very well done, it does not have the same art theme the others do. I would have loved for them to finish with that same creativity, in a manner that mirrors the theme of the lesson. Again, in the grand scheme it doesn't matter, but that third style would have been a welcome addition to an already beautiful movie. The VERDICTA Monster Calls is the first film to make me tear up in my years of doing reviews. It's stunning example of the visual prowess of art, that is well crafted to tell a story that will pull at many heart strings. However, be warned that this movie is not your typical animated monster meets boy adventure tale, but one that is meant to teach us some rather important, albeit darker, lessons about life. Is it worth a trip to the theater? I think so because of the visual styles and the roller coaster ride of feelings this movie will generate. If you can't find the time though then hit this one on Redbox when you can. My scores are:Drama/Fantasy: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0"
" Moody, atmospheric, powerful and emotional.
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie is brilliant. Go watch it! It is moody, atmospheric, powerful and emotional. In fact I cried lots! It also has rolling, rustic countryside (if countryside can be described as rustic), and stone built cottages that are full of clutter. The rooms in the hospital scenes are also full of clutter.The plot is straightforward. A teenager has a mum with a terminal illness. At night he experiences a recurrent nightmare about his mum, and is also visited by a giant ""tree monster"". The ""tree monster"" is full of tales with a point to them, and also prone to philosophical aphorisms.The movie is adapted from a book of the same title, aimed at teenagers, but the movie itself seems to be geared towards an older audience and contains many adult themes. As an afterword, the mum is played by Felicity Jones (of Rogue One fame), and I'm sure she gives a more endearing performance here than she does in the Star Wars movie."
" How To Let Go
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,6,"I saw ""A Monster Calls"", starring Lewis MacDougall-This is his second movie, with his first being Pan_2015; Felicity Jones-Rogue One:A Star Wars Story, The Amazing Spider-Man 2; Sigourney Weaver-Exodus:Gods and Kings, Baby Mama and the voice of Liam Neeson-The Taken movies, Star Wars:Episode 1-The Phantom Menace.This is a movie about a 12 year old boy and how he deals with the inevitable death of his mother. Lewis is the boy and Felicity is his mother that has a disease that her doctors can not find a cure for. Lewis is also having to deal with bullies at school so it's no wonder he lashes out by destroying things in the house in fits of rage. He also has a recurring dream about a church and a graveyard that collapses into an unending hole. At the edge of the hole is his mother and he can not save her in time. Just as she falls, he wakes up. Sigourney plays Lewis' grandmother that comes to help watch him while Felicity is sick. Another way Lewis copes-besides destroying household furniture-with his mother's deteriorating condition is with a daily visit from a tree that comes to life and talks to him. Liam is the voice of the tree/monster. Liam tells Lewis that he will come and tell Lewis 3 stories, one a day. Afterwards, Lewis has to tell Liam a story. Remember, this is all in Lewis' head, so it is his way of working things out. It is an interesting story about a boy learning how to let go. It's rated PG-13 for scary images and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes. It's not one that I would buy-once was enough-but it would be a good rental."
" Lo and Behold and Original Film
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"Somewhere in between this film's vibrant colors, its collage of fluttering paint and its exquisite, rustic setting, a thought crossed my mind. Well two in fact, but more on that later. The disarmingly simple tale of a boy who conjures a monster to solve his problems is the kind that feels familiar. Yet with a surprising amount of maturity coupled with a frank exploration of grief, anguish and anger, A Monster Calls is unlike anything you have seen before. Watching A Monster Calls is like discovering a new chemical compound or mixing colors to make a startling new hue. That's right, for the first time in a long time, I feel like I've watched something new.The monster has been conjured by a nearby ewe tree, which is rooted in a cemetery a bit too close to the young Conor's (MacDougall) home. He frequently has nightmares, exacerbated by the fact that his mother has been suffering from cancer for quite some time. At 12:07 the monster, a lumbering assemblage of branches and roots, stops in to tell three stories. ""The fourth you must tell and you must speak the truth,"" the monster says. Yet with Conor's intermittent struggles with his oppressive grandmother, his absent father and the bullies in school, the monsters stories sound more to him like elaborate riddles than anything that might help ease his pain.The story itself has a fable-like quality that soothes the soul with lessons that, to this day remain frightfully undervalued. When not interweaving artful displays of special-effects, the film beautifully and honestly brings its characters to life – warts and all. Lewis MacDougall's instincts are absolutely at one with the story – he finds the perfect moments to reveal Conor's inner-life and seems to have internalized what his mother says about what makes his drawings more real; ""It's all in the eyes."" Felicity Jones, Sigourney Weaver, Toby Kebbell also all find their footing like singers naturally adjusted and practiced for their harmonies. While Jones recoils, Weaver propels; when Jones beams, Kebbell simpers. What we get at the end, is a symphony of feeling. One in which director J.A. Bayona is its stalwart conductor.And as a conductor, Bayona uses a wide range of visual cues and storytelling techniques to his advantage, to set the appropriate tone. When the monster leers at the paralyzed boy, branches crack and knot around the mis en scene in glorious texture. When the monster recalls tales of long ago, the screen explodes in scenes of animated watercolor. And lest you think things are only interesting when the monster calls, the set design is so rich with story enhancing detail that not a frame of this film loses impetus.Which brings me to my second, not so gracious thought; with a movie so honest, I honestly wonder who this movie is for. Its messages are so clearly displayed and its themes are so outwardly depressing that I fear audiences would run the other way before taking a chance on it. In addition, the film wraps things up much like a fable, going so far as to announce the moral of the story, which leads me to believe this film's prime demographic is children. Show me a parent with enough faith in their child to bring them to A Monster Calls and the popcorn is on me. As the monster himself said, ""People would rather live with a comforting lie than the truth, knowing full well they need the truth to tell the lie."" I doubt many will see A Monster Calls, despite its pedigree, despite its special-effects and despite its new and refreshing story. This is a movie that will reach deeper than you're used to, ask more of you than you're used to and give you the feels way, way more than you're used to. Some may find that notion too hard and shy away. I for one found this film and its endgame positively vital."
" Phenomenal Cast and Story!
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"When I first watched the trailer, I teared up a little. Firstly, I love fantasy-based movies. Secondly, I like when monsters are not just two-dimensional characters. The beautiful story, written by Patrick Ness, is translated amazingly onto the big screen. All the actors have done a commendable job. Liam Neeson and Felicity Jones do not disappoint. Neeson uses his voice cleverly in order to display various emotions and even tension. It is a beautiful movie that I would love to watch all over again. Also, a must-mention is Conor, played by Lewis MacDougall, who essays the role effortlessly. The mother's character is heartbreaking and poignant. The heartless grandmother, too, is wonderfully depicted by Weaver!"
" A Monster Calls is visually spellbinding
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"A Monster Calls is a metaphorical tale of dealing with loss wherein the monster -- through his stories -- helps Conor understand his feelings. It stirs and excites you. You wait for Conor's nightmares, you wait for the monster. The unpredictable narration keeps you engrossed. A wonderful performance by the movie cast - Felicity Jones. The narration of the plot between the child and his mother is absolutely amazing. Lewis MacDougall and Liam Neeson. It's JA Bayona's magnificent masterpiece.The acting performances are spot on and they leave you mesmerised at the climax of the movie. A great movie after very long. It is definitely a must watch!"
" A solid way to start 2017.
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"The first thing I have to say about 'A Monster Calls' is that you should steer clear of any trailers or marketing for this film. It may be hard to avoid it because it feels like it's everywhere right now. In front of various YouTube videos, almost every movie, and endless commercials promoting it as a sappy feel good movie. Yet upon seeing the film, what it's actually about is a child growing up. Of course, we have seen the countless coming of age stories that are very bland and by the numbers. And while this one is that, it's only that to an extent. The reason that clichés and tropes exist is because, if done well, they work very well. It's when they are just forced in that they become annoying.That's what's great about 'A Monster Calls'. It acknowledges the clichés they are using and makes them feel necessary to the story. The story here revolves around a boy that gets pushed around and is just a sad young man. His mom is very sick and he has to kind of take care of himself while also taking care of her. The thing that most films like this get wrong is that they show everything happening around the young kid instead of showing how the things around him affect him.That's what this film does very well. It shows what's around the boy without straying from his perspective. It tells its story through the main characters point of view. Throughout the entire film, we hardly ever leave his side. In doing this we are able to live through him and see the world as he does. It makes everything feel more personal and emotional.Which was refreshing to see. Normally these kinds of films force feed you information by either blatantly telling you what's happening or leave our main characters side to show you something nearly unrelated. 'A Monster Calls' never does that. Everything that you need to know is shown to you as Connor learns it. We don't know hardly anything he doesn't. And while this type of story is pretty see through it's still able to hold its own weight.Despite us being able to predict the entire film from frame one, it is still able to make you feel for these characters. Which is pretty rare for these coming of age stories. Outside of how the film actually tells the story, the biggest surprise here was both the special effects and Liam Neeson. I kept waiting for a scene where the effects took me out of the film due to a bad render or green screen.But that scene never came. I was constantly engaged in what was happening and was able to actually care about Neeson's treebeard character. Who, for me, was the best part of the movie. He plays the monster with such charisma and character that it's nearly impossible not to love him. It really is a treat to see how Neeson just became this character, unlike another tree that says only three words...However, this film isn't anything mind blowing. It's one of those mom/grandma kind of movie. It's very safe, predictable, and ends up tugging at your heartstrings. It's the kind of movie where you see it and then forget about it within a week. There's nothing miraculous about it. It's a well crafted and smartly written film but it doesn't do anything other than just being a coming of age story. It's pretty transparent and easy to follow without a ton of thinking involved. Which isn't inherently a bad thing. The film remains good despite this. It's nothing to write home about but it's a solid way to start 2017."
" Emotionally Honest
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"A Monster Calls is the rare movie geared toward a younger demographic which refuses to pull an emotional punch. The movie explicitly states that the protagonist, Connor O'Malley, is ""too old to be a kid and too young to be a man"". The introductory tagline is the perfect way to relay the film's tone to the audience. From the brutally honest acting to the gorgeously animated ""stories"", A Monster Calls allows raw emotion to emanate from the experience. Magic on the screen happens due to the unique specificity of our hurt hero. The fantastical elements found in a typical family movie organically merge with the painful reality of adulthood. For example, a fight will begin building up in Connor and the anger will call out the monster. The monster is never a simple vicarious outlet for the young adult. Instead, the monster is a well-executed manifestation of perceived guilt towards a deeper truth. Liam Neeson's monster revels in the humanity of the moment while also holding a magnifying glass up to it. Life continues to get worse for Connor and each appearance leads to a gradual slip of harsh reality. Refreshingly, A Monster Calls never hides that uncovering important personal insight is a painful process. The climax makes up for one of the most touching revelatory moments in modern cinema. The value of the film is revealed in how both children and adults in the audience gain a better understanding of the inherently personal nature of grief. The way we deal with a loss can come across as something else entirely for ourselves. A wide release of the film will hopefully begin to kindle in an audience a desire for introspective cinema. In a sense, specific scenarios are able to paradoxically tap into a universally human truth. Movies like A Monster Calls show a better alternative to the next soulless generic blockbuster movie."
" An adaptation that stays true to the source material
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"""A Monster Calls"" is based on the novel with the same name. It's about a young boy, whose mother has a terminal disease. He now searches for moral support in a tree that has started talking to him.The movie was directed by the same man who directed ""The Impossible"". This man is called J.A. Bayona. In this movie he did a very good job at directing the film. He used nice transactions between shots. The scene where Conor angrily closes the fence of the graveyard and the scene transact to Conor opening the door of his house. This was done so well that it seemed that the fence gate became the house door. He did that more often throughout the film. Something that I also liked was the he used perspective to create some symbolic shots. The shot that I want to give as an example is where it starts raining outside and the first raindrops that land on the window, seem to be tears from Conor, who's sitting behind the window. Clever things like that are hidden throughout the whole movie, which is something I very much appreciated from the director. J.A. Bayona is very good at creating emotional scenes and they all work. There's not a scene where the emotion feels forced. He also is a good visual director. This was also due to the very good cinematographer Oscar Faura. The use of focus was very good and so was the use of shadow. Lots of good-looking shots were created that way. There were also a lot of close-ups in the film, which really helped to show the emotions of the characters and set up a theme for the movie, which worked really well. The soundtrack I found to be unoriginal. There were a lot of songs that a lot of movies have already used, or something very similar to that song. But at times the songs really helped to set up a certain feel to the scene. What I did like about the movie was the way the three, well two actually, stories were told. I wasn't expecting an animated sequence, but I was hoping for it. The style they went with was very good and I also liked how they integrated The Monster into them and using him as a transaction between two story parts. The animation in them was good as well. Another thing that came as a surprise was the opening credit sequence. It was drawn in the same style the novel was drawn and the result was absolutely beautiful. Now that I've praised the movie a lot, now some things that were lesser good: the CGI. The Monster looked realistic and good, but sometimes when there was an overabundant of it, it just looked messy and not good. This was mostly the case when the backdrops were created out of CGI, because at those moments you were really able to tell that the actors were standing in front of a green screen.The acting was fantastic. The actor of Conor gave one of the best child-performances I've ever seen. Conor was played by Lewis MacDougall. At first I was very skeptical with him, but eventually he had persuaded me. He gave the best performance out of the whole film, and that says a lot, with both Felicity Jones and Sigourney Weaver in the movie. He did well in the emotional scene and also in the other scenes, where he didn't have to express how he felt, but only showed it through his eyes. I believe that he has a future in acting in front of him. Felicity Jones also gave a fantastic performance, one of her better performances in her career. She really sold her role. Sigourney Weaver I also liked very much. I found her English accent to be good, I didn't notice that she was an American during the film, which is, of course, a good sign. Liam Neeson did a good job at voice-acting. His voice was of course changed a bit later in post-production, but the emotion he put into his voice was very good. And lastly Toby Kebbell, who played the Dad of Conor. He was very likable in his character. This was due to the good writing for his character, but also due to the charisma Toby Kebbell has and due to his performance.The writing was also good. The story I knew would be good, because I've read the novel myself. The adaptation of it I found to be very good. The movie followed the book very well. Only one character was left out, which didn't cause any problems. It would've only helped to develop the character of Conor, but the script of the movie did already justice enough to that part. The other characters were also developed well. The dialogue too was good. It was realistic and intriguing. There were also some lines that challenge you to think further upon them. A thing that I liked about the writing was that three stories told by The Monster were more than you'd expect. They weren't superficial, but profound. They ask you to think about them, and that's what makes the movie more for adults than for children. But also the subject matter (cancer etc.) is more suited for adults.In the end ""A Monster Calls"" was a very good film. The acting and directing was very good. The actor of Conor was surprisingly good and really made you feel with him. The writing was also fantastic, what makes this movie such a good adaptation of a beloved novel. The only real negative thing on this film is the CGI. Often this looked fake and you were able to tell that it most defiantly was. Those things are the reason I'm giving this film an 8.7/10"
" ""I'll. Be. Right. Here.""
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"The worst thing about this movie is its title. The second worst thing about this movie is its trailer. Both will either a) put people off seeing it (it succeeded in that with my wife for example) or b) make people conclude it is a 'nice holiday film to take the kids to', which is also an horrendous mistake!This is a crying shame because it is a riveting drama and a superb piece of film-making that may well catapult it already into my top 10 films of 2017. But it is not, I would suggest, a film that is remotely suitable for kids under 10 to see, dealing as it does with terminal illness, bullying and impending doom. For this is a dark (read pitch black) but hauntingly beautiful film.Lewis MacDougall, in only his second film (after last year's ""Peter Pan"") plays Conor - a young but talented and sensitive artist growing up as a 12 year old in the North of England with his single mum (Felicity Jones). She is suffering from an aggressive form of cancer and is forever medically grasping for a new hope (D'ya see what I did there?). Young Conor believes fervently that each new treatment will be 'the one' but the building tension, the lack of sleep and his recurrent nightmares are destroying him mentally and physically. As if this wasn't enough, his distracted nature is leading to him being seriously bullied at school and there is the added stress of having to live in his grandmother's pristine and teen-unfriendly house when his mother is hospitalised. Towering over the nearby graveyard on the hill is an ancient yew tree and Conor is visited after midnight by this ""monster"" (voiced by Liam Neeson). Is he dreaming, or is it real? The tree dispatches wisdom in the form of three 'tales', with the proviso that Conor tell the tree the fourth tale which ""must be the truth"".A tale of grief, guilt and a search for closure, this is a harrowing but rewarding journey for the viewer. The film is technically outstanding on so many levels:the art design is superb, with the gorgeous 'tale animations' being highly reminiscent of the beautiful ones in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1""; the use of sound is brilliant, with sudden silence being used as a weapon with which to assault the senses in one key sequence; - the cinematography by Oscar Faura (""The Imitation Game"") is faultless, capturing both the dreary reality in a Northern winter with the comparative warmth of the strange dream-like sequences;the music by Fernando Velázquez is used effectively and intelligently to reflect the sombre mood; the special effects team led by Pau Costa (""The Revenant"", ""The Impossible"") shines not just with Neesen's monster, but with the incorporation of the root and branch effects into the 'normal' surroundings. As the BFG illustrated, having a whole film carried by a young actor is a bit of an ask, but here Lewis MacDougall achieves just that like a seasoned pro. His performance is nothing short of staggering and - although a brave move by the Academy - it would be great to see him nominated for a BAFTA acting award for this.Confirming her position in the acting top-flight is Felicity Jones, heart-wrenching in her role of the declining mum, and Sigourney Weaver is also excellent as the po-faced but grief-stricken grandmother. Liam Neeson probably didn't add much by getting dressed up in the mo-cap suit for the tree scenes, but his voice is just perfect as the wise old sage.The only criticism of what is an absorbing and intelligent script is the introduction of Conor's Dad, played by Toby Kebbell (Dr Doom from ""The Fantastic 4""), who is literally flown in from LA on a flying visit but whose role is a little superfluous to the plot. This is exactly what ""The BFG"" should have been but wasn't. It draws on a number of potential influences including ""Mary Poppins""/""Saving Mr Banks"" and ""ET"". Wise, clever and a thing of beauty from beginning to end, this is a treat for movie-goers and a highly recommended watch. However, if you have lost someone to ""the Big C"" be aware that this film could be highly traumatic for you..... or highly cathartic: as I'm not a psychiatrist, I'm really not that sure! Also, if you are of the blubbing kind, take LOTS of tissues: the film features the best use of a digital clock since ""Groundhog Day"" and if you are not reduced to tears by that scene you are certifiably not human.

" A Monster Calls. A modern fairy tale, which is scary in places, so may not suitable for a very young audience
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"First film of 2017, starring Lewis MacDougall as Conner the boy, Felicity Jones as the mother, Sigourney Weaver as the very strict grandmother, Toby Kebbell as the absent father and Liam Neeson as the voice of the Tree Monster.Connor is a 12 year old, he needs to deal with several heavy emotional situations simultaneously. His mother is dying from cancer, he is being viciously bullied at school, his father lives in USA and has been absent for the majority of his life but makes a rare visit. The Tree Monster is originally a creation from his mum's imagination. Towards the end of the film we see an old artist's pad where she had previously sketched the Monster and other fairy tale scenes. The Monster visits Connor every night at precisely 12:07, the Monster wants to tell him three stories and hear one in return. The three stories are from his mum's imagination, represented by the fairy tale sketches she leaves. These stories help Connor deal with his feelings of anger, sadness and frustration. Lewis MacDougall was particularly impressive, a standout child performer. I was pretty much immediately and totally invested in the character. Lewis carries the film throughout. This film is a very emotional fantasy drama, and a real tear-jerker, especially towards the end where it deals with the death of a parent from a child's perspective and the leaving of a child from a parent's perspective. Highly recommended."
" MacDougall is Phenomenal in this Beautifully Heartbreaking Movie
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"A Monster Calls follows the story of Connor, a child too old to be a kid, but too young to be a man, as he goes through probably the hardest time a child his age could go through. His mother is slowly dying of a terminal illness, and his father lives with his new family in America, leaving Connor to look after her. When his mother gets particularly bad, Connor has to stay with his strict, house-proud grandmother. To make matters worse, he endures particularly horrendous bullying at school, is haunted by a nightmare, and everyone treats him differently. He is overcome with anger and grief. That is until the tree in the cemetery behind his house comes to life and starts telling him paradoxical stories. Through these stories, Connor starts to unpack the hard truths of life and is better able to deal with what's going on around him.When it comes to what the movie wants to say, and the lessons that can be gleamed from it, there are many. Each of the stories that the monster offers Connor have their own parabolic messages, and they all act as smaller parts of a larger truth that Connor himself must accept. Fundamentally, A Monster Calls is about grief, it's about dealing with loss and the emotional baggage that comes with, be it anger, sorrow, or guilt.Much like Labyrinth I reviewed a few days ago, there's a few deeper meanings and subtle uses of metaphor and symbolism that helps to elevate the movie, particularly to keener eyes. The most obvious is the prevalence of clocks. There's a clock in almost every scene, showing the passage of time and how it's inescapable, but also the time on those clocks can often hold meaning themselves, most notably the time the monster appears, which proves to be a pivotal time in Connor's life later on.A Monster Calls would not have worked nearly as well without Lewis MacDougall as Connor. A relative newcomer (having only starred in Pan previously, which no-one watched), he shows a talent and maturity that often outshines the more experienced actors surrounding him. His ability to show the conflict bubble underneath the surface, and let it explode out and retreat back in all in a single scene is breathtaking. From his outbursts of anger to his teary-eyed great and sorrow is palpable. Felicity Jones doesn't get a whole lot to do other than look horrifically ill, but the scenes she shares with MacDougall early on are enough to warm your cockles. Sigourney Weaver isn't entirely convincing as an elder British lady, but stills manages to put on one of the best performances I've ever seen from her. One scene in particular, completely without dialogue, shows the strength she can inhabit as an actress, whistling through shock, anger, and devastation all in a single heartbeat. It's a scene that will forever remain with me purely thanks to her. Finally Toby Kebbell appears every now and then as Connor's father, and I'm still in disbelief that he hasn't properly hit the big time yet.Of course half of what attracted me to A Monster Calls in the first place was the visuals, and it doesn't disappoint. Most notable is the creation of the monster himself, recreated with such life- like detail through motion capture thanks to the combined efforts of Liam Neeson and Tom Holland. His presence is both frightening and comforting at the same time. He's a true behemoth, and his introduction is terrifying, an aspect that is never truly lost even at his most benevolent. The detail on him, from the scratchy bark to the creaking branches is astounding and immersive.Furthermore, he's not the only visual aspect that deserves praise, as two of his stories are told, somewhat in the vein of Hermione's telling of the Deathly Hallows, almost entirely in small animated interludes that are truly beautiful to behold. The first is all inks and watercolours, creating a somewhat typical fantasy world of charming princes and evil stepmother queens, but with a dark twist. The offset between darkness and colour aids the storytelling perfectly. The second is made with degrees of stop-motion (emulated or not, I can't tell) silhouettes of an industrial era conflict between a priest and a pagan apothecary, and again, it's simply beautiful to watch, with the animation aiding in the telling of the story itself, setting moods and emotions and visually portraying the story's setting.What a way to start my year. A Monster Calls is a near faultless movie, with beautiful animation, impressive performances, and a surprisingly profound story that'll tug on your heartstrings as much as it'll have you thinking and dissecting the subtle symbolism throughout (although it does wear most of what it wants to say on it's sleeve). If I had one criticism, it's that it's unrelenting in it's treatment of sorrow and grief. This is an emotionally dark movie, and it does little to lighten the mood. By the time we reach the inevitable and unsurprising conclusion, I felt emotionally drained and crushed and just wanted it to end (which in retrospect is actually the most fitting achievement of this movie). I give A Monster Calls a solid 9/10, and would absolutely recommend it. It's probably too much for those going through loss, and too frightening for younger viewers, but everyone else just needs to make sure they bring plenty of tissues."
" Not as good as I'd hoped
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"....firstly if your intending on taking young kids as lots of folks at the showing I attended did, please don't. This is not a film for young kids i.e. it's a film about - on the films own words - someone too old to be a child and not old enough to be a man - a kid trying to deal with a parents serious illness and the emotions it entails.The CGI for the 'monster' is excellent as are the storytelling graphics which will become apparent as the story unfolds. Sigourney Weaver for me however is as unconvincing as Connor's grandmother as her English accent. I'm guessing the producers have gone for a big Hollywood name to bolster the lesser known actors. Having said that it's a shame they didn't consider an English actress, there is no shortage of equally big name older English actresses.Whilst the film is good having read many of the critics reviews I think I was expecting something far better which is a shame. Good movie but best of the year as one highlight review stated, I don't think so."
" A Monster Calls is a magical, stunning and heartbreaking tale that cannot be faulted.
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,10,"""A Monster Calls is the most emotional film I have ever seen. Almost immediately, one can sense the pure heart at this centre of this exquisite piece of film and that sensitivity and empathy never wavers, crafting an experience that feels both intimately personal and widely relatable. It's endpoint is foreseeable but it does not make the journey any less heartbreaking or compelling, offering true sincerity every step of the way. Thematically, the film deals with some incredibly complex and difficult ideas to explore in a story that needs to be accessible by all ages, but superbly handles them so they can be recognised and accepted by all. It's a huge ask for a film to be able to deliver the same message to a multitude of people varying in age, gender and background but it all comes together in such a touching way. It's words, script and screenplay from Patrick Ness are poetic, deeply creative and inventive. The stunning script and crushing themes are only the foundations to this sensational film and knowing the context of the novel's birth and development only add to the authenticity of this film.""Read my full review of the film, which has every possibility of topping my 'end of year' list come the end of the year! - http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/a-monster-calls-2017- review.html"
" A Monster Calls to ensure the audience have no dry eyes.
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"An adaptation of the critically acclaimed novel, A Monster Calls is about a 12 year old boy who struggles to come to terms with his mother's battle with cancer. I remember reading the book a few years ago and was moved by the unique perspective of such a tragic yet relatable story. Having now seen the film adaptation, I can safely say that this is one of the best book-to-film adaptations I've seen and if this does not get nominated...heads will roll. Newcomer Lewis MacDougall takes on the role of Conor, quite a difficult character to portray but he does so perfectly. I had initial concerns especially as a newcomer but his debut performance solidifies that he will have a successful career in the future. He wasn't an annoying child actor, he personified the maturity of Conor exceptionally and when it came to the more emotionally driven scenes he was extraordinarily good. He is in the company of Felicity Jones (who I really really hopes gets nominated) and Sigourney Weaver in which the latter gives one of her best performances. The story is one we have seen many times in films, but what makes this more creative is the story is told through the perspective of Conor and the monster he imagines to help get him through this difficult time. Even the credits are told through his perspective as the characters are stated as their relationship to Conor (i.e. Mum, Dad etc.), I thought that was a nice touch. J.A. Bayona mixes the dark mature tones with the child-friendly shell that the marketing may have you suggest but do not be fooled. I can assure you, you will feel. You will get the feels. I consider myself emotionless and yet I grew slightly teary in many scenes, it's just so emotionally powerful without the film being manipulative and to me that is an extremely admirable trait to have. As the monster (voiced by the epic ness that is Liam Neeson) describes three tales to Conor, the film pulls the audience into a watercolour animation sequence which is absolutely beautiful to look at. The fact that Bayona decided to retain the watercolour and sketching style shows that he knows what he is doing, he is a confident visual director. Patrick Ness, who wrote the book, also wrote the script for the film which is why it is an extremely faithful adaptation. Perfect balance of smart wit and captivating drama. Overall, A Monster Calls is simply one of the best dramas I have ever seen. Tantalisingly powerful, heart achingly emotional and beautifully majestic. The best thing I can say, is that I want to see it again right away.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com"
" A Monster Calls, a fantastically visual fairy tale that pulls you into an emotional journey of the struggling Conor O'Malley in an fitting cinematic representation
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"J. A. Bayona (The Impossible, The Orphanage) makes a very strong adaptation from Patrick Ness' marvellous tale. Still behind the screenplay, Ness's moving story is successfully portrayed on the big screen. A Monster Calls is a emotional fantasy drama that concerns the troubling life of Conor O'Malley,and his encounters with therapeutic peculiar 'monster'.Conor (Lewis MacDougall) is a troubled bullied teen ""to0 old to be a kid but too young to be a man"" who gets visited daily by the immortal fairy tale tree monster (Liam Neeson), as Conor struggles to cope with his mother's terminal illness. While events unfold the 'monster' claims he will tell three stories to inspire and teach Conor during this difficult period.What makes this cinema experience unique for me is the fact that I have read the book beforehand. For the first time I can proudly say these words ""the book was better than the film"" but this still a very marvellous cinematic experience. The only issue is that I feel I have invested myself in the story already and have had my reaction to emotional journey. However this does not make this a weak film at all quite the very opposite.What you have the heart of the film is the brilliant performances by all the cast. Lewis MacDougall's Conor O'Malley is exactly spot on with a very compelling performance. Combined with the motion capturing Liam Neeson, who although is no physically present through the power and attitude in his voice Neeson mostly brings the monster alive and creates a very solid relationship with Conor. Sigourney Weaver plays a very satisfying role as Connor's grandmother and takes on the very traditional strict grandmother with a British accent that works and survives the entire film. With Felicity Jones just jumped from Star Wars proves her range from being a galactic freedom fighter to the loving ill mother delivering the real sadness and emotion driving the majority of the film.What carries the rest of the film is the visual poetry through the animation and visual effects. When the animation comes alive, the book comes alive as the monster's stories are shown on screen and we see them as if they were paintings. What is also a strong visual factor is the monster itself, which is very superbly captured by Liam Neeson, but with a stunning attention to detail in the creation of the tree monster.Although only ever reading the one book and watching the recent online series Class,what Patrick Ness has a passion for is the struggles of young people, especially when dealing with grief. Ness successfully explores these issues through fantasy that effectively emphasises the pain that his characters battle through. I believe that could see this when reading the book, and so what as affected by the film but do believe that audience who have not read the book can experience this in the film.To summarise the film in one word would be 'gloomy' which isn't a bad thing but you should know what the film starts you are very aware that this isn't going to a fun happy smiles film, and mostly definitely is not a family film. Bayona has very clearly demonstrated his understanding of Ness' work with some small changes but creating a most beautiful and fantastic adaptation.A Monster Calls is wonderful very emotional film that will really touch and mesmerise audiences with its wonderful visual cinematic appearance. A solid adaptation but was not a complete match to book for me. 7.9/10"
" A charming yet dark fantasy.
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"I actually got to see this at a Screen Unseen last month but had put off writing the review until the right time of year, or should I say, the right year. And wow what a year of movies 2016 glad us. So this is going to be the first official review of 2017, ahead of Assassin's Creed and Silence. Director of The Impossible, J.A. Bayona, gives us a fantastical fairytale of boy meets monster, where imaginations run wild with the boy tries to cope with tragic realities. Conor, played superbly well by Lewis MacDougall, fitting the awkward, introverted schoolboy, is troubled, from a broken family, he lives with his dying mother, played by Felicity Jones and whilst what faces him is inevitable, he decides to battle against it, even against himself in a way. His imagination and distress appears to summon a mythical monster that resides upon the hill, in the graveyard outside his home. Essentially he's an Ent, or more like a Groot with a vocabulary, with the wondrous voice of Liam Neeson who would make an excellent voice for a Decepticon Transformer. The imagery is amazing and the animated parts very enticing, reminding me very much of Harry Potter: The Deathly Hallows. But, it feels like it's cut short, skipping a pivotal part, rushed over, almost feeling cheated, I wanted and expected to see more, even though it does seem long for 108min running time. There was a moment where this film reminded me a lot of The NeverEnding Story, thinking it was going to head that way but no, it's a different film entirely and it's only Conor's escapism that bares resemblance to the classic '84 film. It's undeniably beautiful and has such a touching story, but there's a chance younger viewers might not understand, however, it's not strictly a children's film with a 12A rating. There's a good score from Fernando Velázquez but nothing totally rememberable. The performances are strong, Sigourney Weaver is great as the opposing grandmother, but I don't think Toby Kebbell's father role was explored enough and there's a couple of weak spots that might disappoint. Overall it's a charming and yet rather dark fantasy that tells a story of a boy struggling with life whose imagination comes frees him from those shackles of guilt and fear. Running Time: 6 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 7 Story: 7 Script: 6 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 6 The Extra Bonus Points: only a 5 for the enchanting animation bits, would have been a 10 but I wanted more of it. 70% 7/10"
