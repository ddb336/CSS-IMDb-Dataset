" Realistic and Entertaining
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,7,"This was a decently written, competently directed, and well-acted film version of the previous excellent Spooks series. The human element was very much evident throughout with no over-the-top Hollywood thrills and spills. Indeed, it was very British and some American viewers might see this film as tepid and lacking the edge-of-the-seat thrills to which they are accustomed. Not that there is anything wrong with over-the-top action fantasy but the danger is this can become cliched, and the accepted norm.This hit the spot for me. Kit Harrington certainly added kudos and blended well with the aways excellent performances of Peter Firth.Enjoy!"
" Stodgy outing for cute Kit and little else.
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,6,"Now I really enjoyed the BBC series ""Spooks"" which ran for about ten years at the start of the 2000s. It followed the antics of some counter-espionage agents working for MI5 dealing with all sorts of wicked foes trying to compromise the safety of Queen and country. Well this big screen adaptation keeps Peter Firth in his role as ""Harry"" but otherwise it just becomes a vehicle for the swarthy Kit Harington to shine as ""Holloway"". He is duped into working with the now disgraced ""Harry"" to thwart a terrorist plot formulated by Elyes Gabel (""Qasim"") that could prove quite lethal to the population of London. It's OK on the action front, lots of chases and pyrotechnics, but a selection of oddly cast supporting folks - Tim McInnerny in particular, but also rather weak performances from the deeply unmenacing Gabel as well as Jennifer Ehle (""Maltby"") and Tuppence Middleton (""Keaton"") - as well as a truly wooden effort from Firth leave this well and truly in the doldrums of spy stories. Harington certainly had something as the fur-wrapped ""Jon Snow"" in ""Game of Thrones"" but he has yet to transfer away from that role into anything that does not entirely rely on his not unpleasing looks - here he is just a good looking man going through the acting school expressions and motions and his scenes with Firth are really stolid. Stick with the telly series - much, much better..."
" Unbelievably crap and exceedingly annoying
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,1,I watched ever season of the actual series. And for the most part I enjoyed it but this was total rubbish. Harry's sidekick was a short assed cocky addition one minute he wants to bring Harry in then he's on his side and then he wants to bring him in and it goes on like that throughout the whole film. And with the same regularity he trusts him then doesn't trust him. Ugh with nobs on. The end is ridiculous but at least the bad guy gets shot. That was satisfying and only that.
" Very poor
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,3,"A big fan of the series, this was very disappointing. Script clever for the sake of it and at the cost of fluency. Difficult to be invested in shallow characters. Ruth would be disappointedðŸ˜‚"
" Good British intelligence.
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,8,"I am quite enthusiastic about this movie. I didn't know anything about the series before but I had a slight prejudice towards British cinema for it's lack of international appeal.
To a foreign audience that movie feels both, very British and modern with great depth. More fun than James Bond, not because of the jokes and the ladies, but because of the guessing game played with the public at all times. The unrealistic perfection of the action scenes and technology feels like a artistic device and not a goal in itself as the psychological unperfection of the characters takes the forefront of the stage."
" Harry can't give his codes to the bad guys
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,7,"Harry can't give his codes to the bad guys, because any high security organization worth their salt would immediately change them as soon as he leaves. Otherwise, I enjoyed the movie."
" Good movie
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,9,"I had to take away 1 star and rate it a 9, I liked the plot, I think the acting was good, I think there probably could have been a little more action and the movie was a little bit confusing, It could have been more clarified. the part of the movie where a terrorist would trade off a target for his wife is a little far fetched, I don't believe those terrorist organizations would stop a potential bombing to save their wife, they don't believe in that sort of thing as terrorist organizations are to self centered."
" If only
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,4,"It's not a bad film, but what you need in a movie like this is a convincing bad guy. Not a nerd who looks like he can't even tie his own shoelaces and is not really very good at acting in any way.
He completely destroys it. Otherwise is would be a 7."
" It is pretty good but it helps if you love the tv series.
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Covid lockdown time and some people are rewatching the Spooks/MI5 tv series.
One of the Spooks fans on the internet says yes Spooks is great tv but we don't mention the film.
Well I love the Spooks tv series and I like film.
It is not brilliant or fantastic but it is better than most of the later series episodes of the tv series.
It has a bigger budget than the tv series and the plot is pretty good."
" Decent Film Version Of The British TV Series
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,7,"Efficient, sleek, entertaining film extension of the hit British spy show responsible for launching the careers of more than a few British actors. It maintains the moral compromise and complexity of the series, and its propulsive, relentless plotting - but we don't have enough investment with enough characters to buy into the show's trademark willingness to kill any character at any time for it work in the film format. Kit Harrington doesn't quite work in the lead role, but for fans of the show, it's a world that's always fun to revisit."
" Excellent spy thriller
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,9,"I can't add anything to adamhoulding 's review of 14May2015. It's spot on. This is a wonderful spy thriller, there's no fat on it, it moves right along, with some nice twists and turns. The Brits and Europeans do spy movies the best, imho. Peter Firth is marvelous in this (as he is in everything!). Kit Harington held up his end well. Definitely a nice way to spend an evening."
" The Greater not so Good
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,5,"Maybe it's just me, but I didn't enjoy this as much as I'd hoped. I loved the Spooks series so was disappointed that there were hardly any characters from it in this film. I got lost trying to figure out who was on which side ( which maybe was the idea). Probably better if you don't know the TV series?"
" Definately A Good Movie - Well Worth Your Time To Watch
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,8,"03/01/2020 A really detailed, well conceived 8-9 stars movie played out with excellent actors/actresses. Do NOT pass this one by! Bon Appetit'"
" Plays like just a TV show.
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,4,The trailer started off with the excitement of a bond flick but then it all fizzled where the movie was just plain boring....I didn't finish it. Avoid!
" Not bad, but why it was necessary?
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,7,"Well, after the long duration of the Spooks series and ""normal"" closure in its last season...? Nothing was really left untold or open so that some sequel was required to clarify matters or to link loose ends. Peter Firth as Harry Pearce is still the pillar of the production, but the events-characters around are not so distinctive as terrorists-bombers were widely seen in the Series as well (sometimes too often, overlaps and replays).The evident wish to include younger generation does not beat the target in full as the domination of ""cute looks"" over character acting is too big, plus the depiction of events may remain intricate to them not having seen the Spooks series. Thus, I can fully understand if their reviews are more critical than mine."
" Sexistic script?
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,2,"I might be wrong, but the relevant women didn't really come off good in this story.
Either killed off, being traitors or blindly following questionable orders.
Hated watching this."
" Actually not a bad movie at all!
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,8,"No bling bling, no over the top action scenes but just a decent spy movie!"
" Kind of confusing, fast paced action
",2019-09-18 00:00:00,6,"I rarely say this about movies, but for me this almost went too fast. I was confused for the majority of the movie about what was going on. The plot twists all over the place, people weaving in and out of headquarters, good guys bad guys random guys. It was all a bit too much. But other than the confusing plot, the action scenes were well coordinated, the acting very good, and nice cinematography. A true spy thriller. My only complaint is they acted like kit Harrington's character was this big bad spy but he had only been on the force for less than a year."
" Watchable, but predictable and forgettable.
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,6,"I really do mean that ""MI-5"" is predictable and forgettable. I watched the trailer for this film, but didn't realize that I'd already seen it until half way through. It's so much like all the other films in this British genre of serious modern spy flicks, that it blends right in with the rest. It's not like this is French Vanilla vs. New York Vanilla, it's more like different brands of French Vanilla. I'm not saying it's bad, given that it's production values were high and the plot was tight and kept moving, it's just that the basic ideas, dialogues, and set shots are so tried and true. I was embarrassed that I didn't remember that I had seen it, since I had to keep watching it, because the person I was watching it with had never seen it before. If I would have remembered it from it's trailer (and, after all, I only saw it a few years ago), I would have selected something fresh. So, in conclusion, if you're looking for a tasty Vanilla treat, this might be right up your alley, but it's nothing you probably haven't had a dozen or more times before. Do not look for novelty here. I hope I don't accidentally watch it for a third time."
" 9:27 too long
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,1,"Movie should stop when the van moves away from tube. She was not qualified to be security detachment guard. Teo bullets, one in each rear tire of the van should had deter the escape.
These secret service people need severe training on how to disable a vehicle"
" Great ending
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,6,Some cool twists. Was lacking something to keep my interest throughout. This is the most vague review and not very helpful. The ending was good for multiple reason. Tune in and find out why!!
" Couldn't watch it
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,2,This is not a good movie. Kit Harington has no business trying to be a spook. I hope for his sake he has saved his dough he made from Game of Thrones.
" Clever
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,8,Tight script. Good pacing. Excellent sound editing. Clever twists and some surprising turns. Great casting and acting. Better than the other MI movies with Ethan Hunt. Average soundtrack.
" Does well with no good
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,8,"No goodness in sight in this well done spy thriller, where everybody has an angle, twisted deeply into deceitful skullduggery, cold blooded murder and terrorism. Even so it is very well done with gripping tension and action sequences, with a nice British flavor. Twists & turns a bit too much but ends well, though not good for most of the cast."
" It was awesome.
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,10,"Every time I thought it was going to do something predictable, it didn't. Definitely worth getting on DVD."
" my notes
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,6,Good spy thriller. nothing special overall but nothing bad either. i enjoyed it (1 viewing)
" People who gave this bad reviews are brainless
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,9,Only people would give this bad reviews because they don't have the iq to follow a true spy movie with a great plot watch this movie other people who didn't like it I really don't understand all the bad review explanations are ridiculous
" Spy movie with a great plot
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,9,I'll keep this short in my opinion better than any of the mission impossible movies always keeps you guessing no pointless car chases or action sequences best of all no Tom cruise jk not really . Glad to see Kit can act in something else besides game of thrones
" Typical TV movie
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,4,"This film is basically the hunt that the MI-5 (British intelligence service specializing in internal security) promotes a fearsome terrorist who escapes them between the fingers. Suspicions that there is a traitor within MI-5 lead two operatives to act in default of the rules and orders to capture and save the service.Of all, the MI-5 is a modest cousin of the British intelligence services, in that it is less well-known and mediatic than the neighbor MI-6. However, the film, which reminded me in some of a common movie 007 (for example, the insertion of credits and some action and fight scenes), is nice to see, although not very good. Only now, when documenting myself to make this criticism, did I realize that this film is the result of a British television series and that many of the characters we have seen here were born in it. However, when I saw the film, I realized clearly that it was a movie more thought for the TV than for the big screen.The script is simplistic and direct, cinematography is vulgar, the soundtrack is uninteresting and there are many dead moments and a reasonable dose of predictability. I do not know any of the actors but I think they were up to the task, which is not surprising if they had done those characters before.Not being close, brilliant, this movie is not that bad and entertains our time well. However, I did not feel like going to see the series that gave rise to it."
" Hugely enjoyable romp
",2019-06-01 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this far more than I thought I would, found it fast paced and well acted. Much preferable to similar American movies."
" Underrated
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,10,"Very good movie, like a modern version of the movie spy game. This is great movie with an excellent style of editing."
" A Brittish Spy-movie with inelligence
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,9,"What struck me most in this film was the overlapping clues of what what was going on. Most of the time you were unsure of where the events would take the plot, and then you get a reveal. But by the next scene, you are not sure if what was revealed was true... untill the very end.Brilliant script, a bit low paced sometimes compared to Hollywood -but this is a Brittish movie and as such is a great one! Good acting and camera work was really good! So nice to see this coming out from outside the US.The plot in this movie really sold it for me. I loved it!"
" SPY WITH MY EYE SOMETHING BEGINNING WITH THE LETTER ""M""
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,9,"""MI-5"" and ""Spooks: The Greater Good"" are the same film. When a high level prisoner escapes, Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) of MI-5 accepts the blame. He knows there is a mole, so he goes off the grid and calls in those he can trust to trap the mole risking lives for the ""greater good.""This was an excellent film with enough twists to keep it interesting without acting overly clever. The plot is different from other spy thrillers. If I had one criticism it was the token hot Asian chick (Eleanor Matsuura) was not a martial arts fighter.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
" Decent but better are out there...
",2017-10-31 00:00:00,5,"A decent spy film, but not the best around. Many features of the film are just okay, like the cinematography and shots. Not many creative shots and it should be more creative with them.However, I did enjoy most of the plot despite being a little confused. I am aware the film is based on a show, but never seen it before. The film manages to get you aware of the characters without seeing the series before, so this is another positive of the film.Some of the acting is decent like Kit Harington and Peter Firth. The villain is very minimal in the film, so there is not much to say about him. Some twist and turns in the plot which is good, but can sometimes get confusing. Another film to just watch on Netflix or on a DVD but worth seeing once."
" Better than expected
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,6,"SPOOKS: THE GREATER GOOD is a big screen spin-off for the long-running British TV series about the adventures of agents working on behalf of MI-5. Peter Firth returns as the inimitable Harry and gets plenty of screen time, which fans will enjoy. The film also sticks closely to its small-screen origins and feels like an expanded TV episode throughout. Plot-wise, it's about the hunt for an Islamic terrorist played by the reliable Elyes Gabel, and similar to the Sean Bean flick CLEANSKIN, but better.The plot twists are surprising at times and the 'hunt the mole' plot is well-utilised. I'm a big fan of GAME OF THRONES, so seeing Kit Harington as the lead was fun for me, although slightly jarring what with him dressed in modern attire and all. Tuppence Middleton is also less irritating than she was in the ill-advised LADY VANISHES remake. Overall, I enjoyed this film, although I'll readily admit that it's no classic."
" Okay, Who's The Canary?
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,6,"This is one intricate plot about the British agency, MI-5, trying to stop terrorists from blowing up Oxford Circle and murdering everybody at the top of MI-5. One unusual twist is that the Americans aren't exactly the good guys. The terrorist leader (no mention of religious fundamentalism) has an American accent. Worse, MI-5 is losing its luster and they have reason to believe that they will somehow be absorbed into the American CIA.Actually, the Brits field three or four fine intelligence agencies, including the equivalents of the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA. MI-5 is the equivalent of one of them but I forget which. In any case, the US often gets tips and evidence from the Brits. As I write this, it's just been alleged that the Brits learned about various connections between one of our presidential campaigns and Russian intelligence/business/government contacts. In Russia, under Putin, the social spheres are pretty much indistinguishable.I missed the first five or ten minutes and it must have been a crippling mistake because there were times I felt like Kier Dullea going through the Stargate episode in ""2001."" In one scene, for instance, a young woman has apparently betrayed someone or committed some other peccadillo and when asked why, she replies, ""I just did what they told me to."" I didn't know who ""they"" were. The plot is impossible to describe in detail because there are so many details.It's an unusual picture of London that we're presented with. It's changed a good deal since I was last there. It's all modernized now, or at least those parts of the city we see in the film. Swirling balconies and streamlined buildings and -- surprise -- it's often sunny. Even Waterloo Bridge looks clean and modern. The cleanliness of the streets, the sleekness of the mass transport, puts American facilities to shame.The performances are fine. Peter Firth, one of the many important players, acts broody and looks like a half-wrecked Anthony Hopkins coming down from battery acid. There is no beautiful gal being fought over. The women, as well as the men, are more or less ordinary. Most outstanding PRESENCE is the noble and thoroughly committed head of MI-5, Tim McInnerny. You have never seen such a somatotype. His features are all squished together, as in a cartoon, and his neck seems about two feet long and bent forward at an angle that imperils his whole head. Really. His image is unnerving.There are quite a few shootings and occasional rumbles but on the whole it's all well done. If you enjoyed, say, ""Smiley's People,"" you should be able to handle this with pleasure."
