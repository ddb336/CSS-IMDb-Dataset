" Very good movie
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,6,"The movie is very good, especially the message that it leaves that you do not always have to look individually but that teamwork can also take you to great places."
" Hallmark
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,7,"This movie is very much a Hallmark greeting card, sappy and overtly sentimental.The movie also has way too much or a religious undercurrent for my personal liking.Having said that and in spite of those thoughts its still a good movie!"

" Tedious and dull, such wasted potential
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,4,"It doesn't feel like it should be that difficult to make a solid inspirational football film. There are plenty of them out there already, and the sport is rife with possibilities for big moments. I'm also a big fan of football, so I'm inclined to enjoy any movie that focuses on it. That's why it puzzles me when I watch a movie like When the Game Stands Tall, and feel so bored. For starters, we're talking about a movie that STARTS with a coach that has managed to lead his high school team to an impressive 151-game winning streak over the span of a decade. Yet our story won't be about the momentous record, instead it will be about the kids who lost in order to end the streak. You'd think any good screenwriter would find out about this kind of success, and want to build a movie around that. Instead they start with a team that's already on top, and expect us to care when they fall from grace. But there's still something to work with in this concept, because the movie knocks them down at the start, and you can make a decent story about a group of losers who have to crawl their way back. Even though I thought the choice of when to set the film was stupid, it still could have worked.The problem is they don't do a good job of creating characters to root for in When the Game Stands Tall. We get to meet some of the players, but I never felt they allowed us to connect with any of them enough to care about their journey. Some of them have little subplots, but I wasn't interested in most of them, and I don't think they did a good job of connecting their stories off the field to their play on the field (aside from one kid looking to set a record, because they had to hammer that one home a ton.) It seems the movie has some slight grounding in faith or religion because we hear scripture referenced a few times. This is ironic since the movie seems to worship the coach Bob Ladouceur with much greater reverence than Jesus. The coach is raised up on a pedestal, and treated as some type of idol. It's too bad that Jim Caviezel appears so disinterested in his performance. I don't know if the real coach is super mellow and Caviezel was trying to match his demeanor, but I swear he looked as bored as I was with the film. I always get pumped up for some good football scenes, so there was some fun to be had with When the Game Stands Tall, but otherwise it was overly bland."
" Damn this is bad
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,2,"I watched it a few years ago....and just rewatched it. I dont remember it being this bad. Good lord. What did seinfeld say...if u see a bad movie, its over in like 2 hours. If u make a bad movie, thats montha of your life. Did these actors know and realize how bad this movie was going to be while they were making it?"
" Preachy and lame
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,4,"Encouraged by many positive reviews here, I decided to give it a try. What a bad choice...The story develops, cliché after cliché, the actors don't portray any believable character, the morals are just typical of any low-cost American movie trying to inoculate this preachy propaganda of family, religion, and respect.I don't say those values are not valid. I just say that when you try so hard to prove them, maybe they don't deserve so much.The technical aspects of the movie are average, just a waste of time."
" Just love this story....
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,10,"You don't have to be Catholic or even religious to appreciate that for a team to succeed to this extent there has to be 'magical' elements - it is fitting that those elements are faith, hope and love - true brotherhood and 'family' to one another, to seek team success, not just individual glory......."
" One of my favorite movie
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie so much.
Perfect actors for this film.
Good scenario, good acting.
I cry lots of time."
" Why This Film Lost Money
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,9,"Critics and leftists intentionally harpooned this excellent film because of a few references to faith-based values. I am not a Christian so I am guilty of believing them and skipping this film when it hit the theaters. Sorry cast, director and producer, my bad. The idiots who hate this country, its founding, and the Protestant ethic, which basically brought every modern convenience and the most advanced infrastructure in history are vile. I am really beginning to despise these people who can hate so violently and virulently because someone believes in conservative values, Christianity or Judaism. This was a damn good film about an amazing man who teaches his students the basic values every one should agree on: hard work, responsibility, honor, brotherhood and community. This movie was avoided by me because I do not like people quoting bible verses and waxing philosophical about God. Yet, this film did not have any of that. The main character is not a Bible thumper or anything close. He is just a good man and fine role-model. Something most people used to aspire to, or at least laud, and respect. Do not miss the credits at the end. Very inspiring and realistic, well acted and directed."
" great movie

" Inspiring film about an inspiring team; Rah rah rah!
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,8,"Bob Ladouceur (Jim Caviezel) has an unbelievable record at De La Salle High School in Concord, California. As the private high school's football coach, he has won an amazing 149 games in a row. Then, the team wins two more and finishes out the season with the conference crown and 151 win record. Amazing! It is shown, carefully, that this has to do with the coach's unique methods and abilities. Yes, he can recruit from a big area around San Francisco and Oakland. But, moreover, he inspires the athletes to work as a team and to write down their commitments to the sport and to a well-lived life. Very admirable this is. Two inner city players are rewarded with scholarships to the University of Oregon. But, things are not always perfect as they seem. For one, Coach Bob has neglected his family of wife, Bev (Laura Dern) and two sons, at times, causing his older son, the team's new quarterback, to smolder with inner anger. Then, Bob himself is a secret smoker, which results in a near-fatal heart attack. Its uncertain if he can continue coaching. Sadly as well, one of his players is killed in an act of random gun violence. Another player is being bullied and shamed by an abusive father. Then, even when Bob is given the chance to coach the team again, the band loses their first game in 152 tries! Will the team and Bob fall apart? This fine film is most inspiring and is based on an equally inspiring true story. Caviezel, one of this viewer's FAVORITE ACTORS, handles the nuances of his role very well and is a great hero on screen. Dern and all of the others, especially the teens, do outstanding work, too. With gorgeous scenery, wonderfully re-enacted football games and a well-paced direction, this film is tops for families, football fans, and those who want movies with a Christian theme. Rah, rah, rah, indeed!"
" Review
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,9,"When the Game Stands Tall is based on true events about a football team who was known for their ""streak"". When they end up losing it, they must overcome difficulties and build their way back up to the best they can be. Instead of the movie being all about the ""Streak"", like it is to the teams' fans, the team rather dismisses the concept of the ""Streak"" and focuses on how to create a connection with the players and build a strong foundation to play the sport of off. Although this movie is about a football team and shows many football playing scenes, it is not just a football movie. 
 When the Game Stands Tall goes so much deeper than the average football movie. It pulls at the viewers heartstrings as they get to know certain players and the difficulties they have had to face on a day to day basis. It does a wonderful job of including real life problems such as the death of loved ones, the challenge of temperament, and the feeling of failure. Rather than focusing on the negatives, this movie does a good job focusing on the bond between the players and how they can improve their relationship with the rest of the team. As said in the movie, ""Life's lasting impressions are when something bad happens to you."" For this team, the bond they formed helped them get through the toughest times they have ever had to face. By including religion and family values, the audience can really relate to the coach and team. The overall journey leads the viewers through many different emotions and will have them on the edge of their seat during the game footage, even if they aren't football fans."
" Religious Inspirational done Correctly
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,7,"Following the true live events of the De La Salle High School Spartans and their epic coach Bob Ladouceur who at one time had a 151 game winning streak. What happens when the champions become the underdogs? A senseless murder occurs of a promising young player... Will the coach, players, alumni recover and soldier on? This film talks about brotherhood and family in ways that all athletes could stand to be reminded of. Fantastic movie."
" Good Story, But Lacking In Real Emotion
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,4,"As a big sports fan (with football near the top of that list), I am usually a sucker for these kinds of movies. I can watch ""We Are Marshall"" at just about any time, I enjoyed every episode of ""Friday Night Lights"", and am easily ""hooked in"" by an inspiring sports tale. Unfortunately, I found ""When The Game Stands Tall"" to be a bit sup-par in the area of truly firing my emotions.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of the De La Salle high school Spartans, who at one point in their history enjoyed a consecutive win streak of 151 games in their football program. But what happens when the cart ends up in front of the horse and the streak overshadows the true nature of high school football? That is the issue that Coach Bob Ladouceur (Jim Caviezel) wrestles with for nearly the entire film.For those who have not watched a ton of sports fiction, you may rate this better than I. It is an inspiring story, to be sure, and the film does a good job of ""telling it straight"". It covers all the right ground and hits all the notes that a film like this needs to do in order to be successful.The problem? Never once during ""When The Game Stands Tall"" did I truly feel emotionally invested in the proceedings. I think this was for a number of reasons, one of which simply being that I've seen better in other films/TV shows. There is nothing about ""Game"" that sets it above (or really even apart) from other fare besides the true story it is telling. Even the acting was a bit shaky for me. None of the players stood out, while Caviezel isn't given an opportunity to really emote. I know he CAN as I've seen him do it in other films, but I felt like this time he spoke in the same, measured voice he is known for and always had the same expression on his face. I wanted to like him more and get a better understanding of what ""made him tic"", but this movie would always seem to pull away and instead just skim the surface.Thus, ""When The Game Stands Tall"" ended up being a 2.5 star movie for me. I was really excited to see it going into the theater, but that excitement did not translate into the greatest movie experience. I can appreciate the story and why director Thomas Carter wanted to put it up on the big screen, but I wish I could have FELT more and THOUGHT less while I was watching."
" Great high school football movie! All coaches should watch it.
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,10,"This was by far the best football movie I ever saw! As a former coach, I loved the relationship with the players (beyond that of a coach). i also saw myself in the coach's growing as an individual and changing his perspective on what is important. You see the tragedy of the death of a player. The hardships of growing up, temptations outside of football and the struggles of family, growing up poor, and the demands of an unrealistic father. I like after the movie when the real coach was shown giving the eulogy at church. The coach also was offered a high paying college job but tuned it down because he realized the impact he was having on the boys he worked with. He also changed his own relationship with one player who happened to be his son."
