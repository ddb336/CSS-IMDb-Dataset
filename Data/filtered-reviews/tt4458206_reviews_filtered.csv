" IF YOU DISMISS ALL WHINING FROM FETO TERRORIST ORG THIS MOVIE IS FINE
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,8,"Human cognition and behavior heavily relies on the notion that evidence (data, events, etc) can affect the credibility of hypotheses. Movies based on true events can not survive without evidences. That being said,
This is a political movie based-on true events. Have you not ever watched a movie based on true events? Probably, almost all of us did. Truth hurts. That is why it is criticized a lot. Some 444 out of 682 clicked either Yes or No to any one of the reviews, many clicked more than once as usual. About 70 wrote something about this. Anyway, the July 15th coup attempt in 2016 (1 year after the movie) also confirms that the critics did not stop at just ""writing reviews"" on IMDb but pulled the triggers and killed 248 innocent civilians, and injured approximately 2200 just plain civilians who were protesting against the coup in the streets of Istanbul and Ankara, in Turkey. The actual The point is reaction to this movie positive or negative confirms that there is a medallion. And, this movie is not a fabrication. And, it fits the mechanics of the following theory: Almost all of the movie-goers might have heard this: there is a concept called 'Reverse Confirmation Theory'. What it means is that the amount of negative reaction showed towards an action indicates that ""thing"" might have a lot of elements of truth, if it is especially about a human element, a sociological trauma. Therefore, according to this theory, this movie actually confirms the events that surround this movie has happened. Regardless of biased feelings.It is just a state truth --unlike America-- opened to public despite waiting 50 years to be transparent.FETO terrorists do not like the truth, so they criticized this one.
That is what terrorists do. Who are ""Feto terrorists""? That is up to you to google..The evidence in the Turkish national and worldwide media, convinced me that this is a good effort to show the public what sour soup was cooking to bring trouble on Turkish people, and where the smoke was coming from..as well as who was behind it!Please do one about the actual coup itself, too. Unlike the successful coup in 1980 in Turkey orchestrated by former CIA Chief Stansfield Turner and agent Hague, this one on July 15,2016 was not successful. What did Turner say about coup-committing Turkish Fmr General Evren Pasha: ""He might not be nice, but he is our guy"". They care about who is ""our"". And, this movie shows, who is not theirs :)
Facts..facts..In short, I like the movie :) Thanks."

" Shittable rainbow
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,1,"That was the phrase what we used to call this kind of horse crap things. I normally have a respect for every kind of movie because the effort that's been carried out; sounds, effects, light etc. But this crap is annoying, misguiding, lying and fooling with you from start to finish.Clearly the work of his fanatic supporters who call themselves the ""hairs of his a.se"" A sh.tty propaganda from a sh.tty place. No sir, we don't eat this kinda crap, thanks but no thanks. You may keep on fooling yourselves but stay there.IMDb: Shouldn't even get one star, must be blank...even one star is too much for this sh.t"
