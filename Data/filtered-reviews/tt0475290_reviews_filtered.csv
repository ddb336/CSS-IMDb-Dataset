" Fun but could've been better.
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,6,"The film was fun and entertaining but lacking in the little details that a movie good. Also, the picture feels constituted of lots of great cameos, instead of actual staring performances."
" Hit-n-miss offbeat comedy from the Coen brothers
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,6,"Hail, Caesar! takes place in the 50s Hollywood. Josh Brolin plays Eddie Mannix, the head of physical production at Capital Pictures. That's a pretty job title for what amounts to a fixer. Someone the studio heads call when one of their actors is caught speeding, or doing drugs, or having the unfortunate case of preggers. And then, one day, one of their biggest stars goes missing just as they're about to finish their biggest movie yet.The story of this film is nothing to write home about. Or rather, it's not the focus of the film. This is a very loose collection of scenes, all aimed to celebrate the Golden Age of Hollywood. The Coen Brothers clearly just wanted to film showy scenes in the style of the classics. We have a choreographed swimming scene. We have a tap dancing scene. We have cowboys. We have stiff upper lip period drama. We have film reel catching on fire. We have it all.And whenever the film is doing that and introducing all these wacky characters along the way, it's very good. Whenever it's trying to tell its story, it's kind of bland and boring, to be honest. For example, Mannix is getting these job offers from a big company named Lockheed. It's good money and better hours, but it would mean leaving the movie business. And I don't care. I so don't care. Go back to tap dancing!The film's humour is also somewhat questionable. But then, it often is with the Coens. They're a fan of rather absurd humour, where you're supposed to laugh because the situation is just so odd. Sometimes it works, often it doesn't, but at least it's intelligent. I'll give it that.Hail, Caesar! is an amazing movie to check out if you're a fan of the classic era of Hollywood and its style. The Coens obviously are in awe of the era and this is a great love letter to it. But, if you don't care about that all that much, there are better comedies out there."
" Messy
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,5,"Hail, Caesar is a comedy about a studio boss who works to resolve a kidnapping of a movie star. This film is fun, but it's an absolute mess. There were many elements that were downright confusing. Not to mention several stupid plot points and unnecessary scenes. It was very hard to keep up and understand what was happening due to the mess that is this film. Also, the characters were poorly written and weren't flushed out well. This film is a comedy and didn't deliver as much as it should've in that category. There were a lot of jokes that didn't land, it was really funny at times, but it could've been better in that aspect. Visually and direction wise it was very good and I like the concept, there were some good scenes, but that's really the best I can say. This film is okay, but it's just a mess. I wouldn't watch it again. I rate Hail, Caesar a 5/10."
" What ?
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,1,"Not as a critic but as the avarage person that saw this movie, it was boring, stupid and meaningless"
" NO POINT MOVIE
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,5,"Allthough I'm usually a big fan of the Coen brothers and I've quite a lot of there productions, I failing to see the point of this one. No story, no direction, no uuhh je ne say qua. A meta movie about making movies with the FORD approach. And all in a LA Confidential setting. I graded it a 5 due to the acting ability of the stellar cast. To sum it up; SAID SAID SAID SAID movie.
But still, for the real Coen fans a must see I guess. Enjoy if you attribute yourself to that group"
" Pro-level parody that will leave many feeling left out
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,8,"In order to ""get"" this film, you'll need to be reasonably versed in Hollywood's Golden era - the time after silent films until the late 70s. When epic films like The Ten Commandments and Spartacus ruled the land, and before gritty heavyweights like Coppola, Scorcese, Friedkin, et al. took over. When films were more about escape, optimism and grand stories, and always had an undercurrent of patriotism.And not just the films of that era. You'll need to know that the business had a seedy side of the more L.A. Confidential variety. Back when getting busted for pot or getting pregnant out of marriage was the cancel culture of the day.But likewise, these scandals could far more easily be buried, and that's where Ed Mannix comes in.If you know something about the real Ed Mannix (played by Josh Brolin here), you know of the forced abortions, intimidation, police payoffs and possible murders. The lies, the bribes, the coverups. He was a well-known ""fixer"" - a guy who makes problems go away, and if the rumors are true, occasionally people, too.But that's the real guy. In HAIL, CAEASAR! he's caring, doting and goes to confession multiple times a day. He listens to his wife. He cares what various religions think about his latest picture because he doesn't want to offend them. Here, he honestly cares about protecting the escapist ideals of Golden Age Hollywood by dutifully covering up its sins. In other words, he's pure parody, folks.And if you're now thinking, ""Oh, fine, but that just doesn't sound very funny"", well, all I can say is, that's what happens when you explain the joke.But if you do get it, you might appreciate the whip-crack dialog and the sumptuous period details. You might appreciate the musical and dance numbers which are simply amazing. When Clooney delivers the closing soliloquy of the epic biblical film, you sense the raw power this pre-method acting era could generate. The Coen Brothers want you to see and feel a little of what that Golden Age optimism was all about, and why Mannix thinks it's worth defending, and they really go all out to show you.Channing Tatum burns up the screen with a ""sailors headed to sea"" dance number that has to be seen to be believed. Scarlett Johansen does a classic synchronized swimming number. It's a feast, and it never feels cheap or just there because ""how can you do a film like this without a dance number""?In the end, it's not infinitely rewatachable like Big Lebowski. It doesn't have that depth nor subtlety. For the right viewer, it will, however, stick with you. And I wouldn't be surprised if another ten or so years goes by and suddenly people start to get what it's all about."
" Behold! Eddie Manix for we have faith
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,7,Like The Big Lebowski in it's tone and farce this doesnt reach that high mark but is still immensely enjoyable. A unique setting full of fantastical characters keep things fresh and moving along at a good pace aided by the usual wry wit in the script with plenty laughs and memorable scenes shot nicely by Roger Deakins once more. Good fun.
" fun, beautiful filmed, leading movie stars happy to be in the film, great acting
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed Hail Caesar, excellent actors happy to work in a Coen Brothers film. gracefully directed, great cameos, well written, costumes were fun. Like most of their films it does not seem to be for a mainstream audience, but thank goodness they can get funding to keep making movies. Hail Caesar"
" What is this movie
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,5,"I really hated this movie. It's not the worst thing in the world, but I really hated it."
" By movie makers, for movie makers
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,9,"I almost passed on this one after reading a 5 star review here. Luckily i gave it a shot, and was not dissapointed in the least.If you are a movie maker, this is a must see.The cinematography jumped out, casting and acting as well. Direction, sets, costumes .. all were terrific. What else can I say?"
" Hail Mary Full of Grace
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,5,"I went looking for a character arc but there was little to find.The set pieces are enjoyable, who doesn't like a well rehearsed musical.I'll never be able to get used to breaking the 4th wall during the action but that's just me.The religious consultation was very well written, the Coen brothers have a strong eye for detail which makes them a fairly regular success but this film was too slow overall for modern audiences.The communist sub plot was nice but it was juxtaposed around characters we didn't really care for.This film plays out like it was written in 6 acts instead of 3 and each one had a different lead writer. You would think with how careful studios are now that they would have sent this back before turning on the lights. There are hundreds of spec scripts that blow it out of the water.I loved the log line as an industry insider and welcomed the story telling but I understand why so many felt this project was an utter waste of their time.There were some big names that got very little screen time. There were pages and pages of description that didn't move the story forward and neglected the obvious capital on the set. It's a very weird outcome for experienced film makers like this. I've come to wonder if they were in a rush or doing someone a favour."
" Entertaining, but not for the plot
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,6,"Reaction to a film by the Coen brothers has to be highly personal, due to the off-beat nature and quirkiness of their work. To me, ""Hail, Ceasar!"" was entertaining not for the plot, but mainly for its style, elaborate sets, and oddball characters. The outstanding characteristic of the film is the fact that everyone remains relatively calm at all times, despite working in the high-pressure motion picture business and being involved in a particularly stressful situation (the kidnapping and ransom for the star of a high budget movie during its final days of filming). That characteristic alone makes watching the movie interesting."
" So many brilliant moments of comedy...
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,"A few moments still stand out years after seeing this: Clooney's tortured attempts to convey awestruck reverence at the sight of Christ's face... The cartoonishly skeezy, arrogant, perversely self-satisfied expression on the photgrapher's face as he silently takes Clooney's photo at the Communist meeting... So, so, deeply funny. And obviously the ""Would that i' t'were so simple"" run. I don't think Alden Ehrenreich ever got the credit he deserved here. Brolin, too, is as fun to watch as ever.As with almost all the Coens' movies, I would bet I need to see this again to fully appreciate it."
" HAIL, CAESAR! THE COEN BROTHERS' TRIBUTE TO OLD HOLLYWOOD
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,8,"This is review I wrote for Hail, Caesar! for CINEMATICA, The Screening Room's movie blog! It was one of my favourite movies of the last six months. It's a beautiful thing! Here is the link to the article on the CINEMATICA website.
Joel and Ethan Coen's Hail, Caesar! has arrived at the Screening Room and is another excellent demonstration of the filmmakers' ability to deftly present sprawling casts of interesting personages in a character-driven tightly-woven script. There is so much to know about this, their latest film. The value of the experience is partially in an awareness of its dense historical and cinematic references. Hail, Caesar! comes off as light-hearted, which it is essentially, but the message of this very film is actually very sophisticated, thoughtful, and deftly presented. It is, incidentally, only one of two Coen Brothers in which nobody dies, the other movie being Inside Llewyn Davis. Costing an estimated $22 million to make and bringing in gross profit of over $29 million as of March 11th, 2016, I'm sure that Universal pictures hoped for a greater immediate financial result, but my guess is that Hail, Caesar! will eventually generate increasing interest and recognition, especially among fans of the Coen brothers. As well as being a movie for people who know and love movies, it is a gorgeous document of a specific period in Hollywood, presenting a stunning amount of visual information about film history in a very short amount of time. The filmmakers have used this production to commendably reproduce a cluster of once popular and now vanished cinematic devices and elements: The film captivatingly spins from one set to another, from one movie to another as we experience life in a major Hollywood studio in the 1950s and get glimpses of many of its productions. As the Coen brothers like to do, they shot the entire movie on 35mm film instead of digital and in some instances they tried to recreate the shooting methods that would have been used in the 1950s as much as they could. According to the film website IMDb, this film references, visually, musically, or choreographically, and/or verbally at least twenty-six movies including Singin' in the Rain, An American in Paris, South Pacific, Vertigo, Ben Hur, Barry Lyndon, and Monty Python's Life of Brian. I have discovered more references than this in the writing of this article. Also, the inclusion of pieces of Hollywood history are rich and pervasive.THE ""FIXER""
Essentially this film is a day in the life Eddie (Edward) Mannix, a Hollywood ""fixer,"" a somewhat coarse studio executive (played by Josh Brolin) answering to the off camera head of the studio named Nick Skank, a subtle nod to Joe Schenck who was the head of 20th Century Fox in the 1950s. In the film, Eddie Mannix covers up legal and personal embarrassments of celebrities on behalf of a major Hollywood company. In the story this character is drawn as a short-tempered man who is a dedicated employee of the fictional Capitol Pictures and a devoted Catholic.This protagonist is loosely based on a real ex-bouncer and producer, and vice-president Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ""Eddie"" (Edgar Joseph) Mannix, who was also known as a Hollywood ""fixer"". The real Eddie Mannix was only pious in the keeping-up-appearance way that kept him from getting a divorce when both he and his wife were both seeing other people. In fact, he was a shadowy, brutal fellow with ties to the mafia. The real-life Mannix was instrumental in ""fixing"" numerous real-life publicity problems for MGM. He kept top-box office star of the 1930s, William Haines' numerous gay affairs out of the press, and tracked down and destroyed a pornographic film that starred an underage Joan Crawford, for example. And similar to how Hail, Caesar! shows the fictional Mannix covering up a pregnancy out of wedlock for the Scarlett Johannson character, the real Eddie Mannix was responsible for setting up a scheme for star Loretta Young to publicly adopt a child who was secretly her own. Mannix also reputedly helped Spencer Tracy get out of a charge for having sex with a minor, and ""fixed"" Clark Gable out of a drunk driving hit-and-run incident.On the more edgy side of things, Mannix is also rumoured to have been involved with the mysterious deaths of Jean Harlow's second husband, his own first wife Bernice Mannix toward whom he was physically abusive, and his second wife's lover, George Reeves, whom Mannix is rumoured to have killed for Reeves having broken up with her. This aspect of Eddie Mannix is explored in the 2006 film Hollywoodland starring Ben Affleck as George Reeves the real actor who played Superman in the old television series The Adventures of Superman in the '50s. In Hollywoodland Bob Hoskins plays Mannix.END OF THE GOLDEN AGEAccording to an interview with Joel and Ethan about the film, however, the real character of Eddie Mannix was not a key consideration to the story. It was more important to them to use this film to showcase an emblematic period in Hollywood history that is known as the end of the ""Golden Age of Hollywood."" The end of the ""Golden Age"" precipitated from a historical U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1948. The verdict was an antitrust ruling against Paramount Pictures prohibiting studios from forcing theatres to buy films in blocks. ""Block Bidding"" meant that, in order to get the more profitable films, theatres had to buy many other films that they otherwise may not want. This landmark verdict severely limited the profit-making ability of the film industry. Block bidding had been happening since the depression in the 1930s when the industry was struggling to stay afloat; and subsequently - especially since the beginning of WWII - it had made the studios very wealthy, hence the flowering in film that was called ""The Golden Age of Hollywood.""The consequence of the end of the ""studio system"" was that the major studio were suddenly much more interested in investing a lot of money in fewer films with mass appeal rather than creating many second-rate films that they were no longer able to force the theatres to buy. This resulted in huge movies with enormous casts, and highly populated dance sequences. Moreover, movies were suddenly being crammed with all kinds of entertainment, tried-and-true familiarity. The stakes were becoming higher still since the post-WWII emergence of home television, which was expected to become a threat to the movie industry.Hail, Caesar! captures the spirit of this time period with great dedication, recreating wildly complex aquatic synchronized swimming displays, intricately choreographed dance sequences, huge biblical epic marches, and reality-defying cowboy gunplay and acrobatics. It was also more important than ever after the end of the ""studio system"" for the industry to protect the reputations of their valuable celebrity assets so that they could continue to bring audiences to the box office, hence the importance of minimizing bad publicity with the use of ""fixers"".BEAUTIFUL REMINISCENCESOne outstanding example Hail, Caesar!'s excellently-realized reminiscences of this time period is of this is a singing and tap-dancing sailor sequence led by Channing Tatum's character, Burt Gurney. The cute sailor costumes are identical to those in the 1949 Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra shore-leave film On the Town. Gene Kelly was the lead choreographer in many of his films and insisted on being shot from head to toe when he was dancing, and this type of camera shot is employed by the Coen brothers in the excellent, complicated, and increasingly homerotic dancing sequence to a song called ""No Dames"" about how life on the sea is devoid of women. ""We may see a moy-maid, But moy-maids got no yams! No yaaaaaaaams!""Another commendable and beautiful reminiscence involves Scarlett Johannson's character, DeAnna Moran, who is a swimming movie star. Moran is based on the legendary Esther Williams, who was an Olympian swimmer picked up by MGM when the Olympics were cancelled in 1940 because of WWII. MGM made Williams into a huge star at the studio through famous and dizzyingly beautiful ""water ballet"" pool sequences that were created by the brilliant choreographer Busby Berkeley. The Coen brothers shot Scarlett Johansson's pool sequence in Hail, Caesar! in the Esther Williams pool that still exists at Sony Pictures with the same complex geometric synchronized motion, high-platform diving, and underwater dancing that Busby Berkeley was famous for directing.Hail, Caesar! also hilariously recreates an admirable gunfighting drama centering on the character of the fictional cowboy star Hobie Doyle. This segment shows an old-Hollywood western, complete with dubious stunts involving horses and gunplay as well as rope tricks, which reportedly involved much one-on-one onsite training with rodeo coaches.The fictional picture for which Hail, Caesar! is named is the one starring the George Clooney character, Baird Whitlock, specifically entitled Hail, Caesar! A Tale of the Christ, a reference to the early film Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925). The Coen brothers concoct a huge Roman epic similar of the Ben Hur of 1959. In an an interview about the film, the Coens say that they watched the battle scenes of the biblical epics that came out in old Hollywood and reverse-engineered the look and feel of them, using the same camera angles and set construction in order to recreate the atmosphere. They said that the unique look of the old epic desert films was sometimes due to the limitations of the older equipment, and that without these limitations - that is working with the new equipment of today - there would be no reason to make the same film choices, which is an interesting discussion in itself."
" A love letter to Hollywood and capitalism
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,9,"What I saw in this movie:
Beautiful modern-quality shots of 1950s era movies (western, tap dancing, peplum...). That's a big love letter to the movies of that time.Communists being ridiculed for their simple worldview, their immoral acts, petty schemes, and delusions of grandeur.A healthy male role model, who gets things done, tries to do what's right, seeks counsel in the church, and slaps communists back into reality.Capitalism as the system that can put giant crews together and treat them well, to build art enjoyed by the many.The story of Jesus Christ as a foundation that can unite everyone.Good values in a beautiful package. A very satisfying experience if you share these values and find it sometimes hard to find them in modern movies."
" Painfully slow and boring
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,1,Tried to watch this due to the high RT score but couldn't make it half way. How is this so highly rated? Slow and unfunny. I just don't get it. A lot of big name actors but wasted on this film.
" A delightful glimpse at 1950s cinema
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,8,"Hail, Caesar is a movie that gives audiences a delightful glimpse at 1950s cinema. It's presented in a way that is interesting and entertaining. I went into this movie with very low expectations, and it's fair to say that this movie surpassed my expectations. In terms of cinematography, this movie was shot beautifully, which really left me mesmerized. In terms of acting, I thought Josh Brolin delivered an amazing and convincing performance as Eddie Mannix, a fixer for Capitol Pictures in Hollywood. Also, I thought Alden Ehrenreich did a great job as Hobie Doyle. Very impressive performance. This movie has sequences that were very well-cherographed and brilliantly excuted, that left me in awe. The production design of this movie is also marvelous. Overall, Hail Caesar is a great movie that gave me a tasteful and insightful glimpse at 1950s cinema."
" Not Even Quarantine-Watching Worthy
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,2,"Full disclaimer, I could only stomach the first 45 minutes of this mess. Maybe it gets better. Maybe it doesn't. Congrats if you made it to the end."
" Awful,
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,2,One of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm 73. Can't believe Clooney put his name on this.
" Horrible.
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,1,"This is truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do not understand how it gets such high reviews. I really expected more from the Coen Brothers. This movie isn't funny, it's stupid with a plot that doesn't make sense. The only good thing about it is the clothes."
" Disappointing Adventure
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,6,"Hail, Caesar! (2016) - [6/10]The Coen Brothers typically make really good films - typically. There are moments in this film that are great, but those are just moments. The rest of the film is mediocre. I was quite disappointed with this film, and I think most people were. It felt really incomplete and all over the place. There really wasn't a main character, and most of the characters felt emotionally detached from the viewer. I couldn't connect with any of the cast (aside from one, maybe two characters) and when I began to do so, that character would disappear. With more than a couple absurd jokes, strange ""out-of-the-blue"" twists, and a star-studded cast, Hail, Caesar! (2016) tries to be so much, but fails to achieve anything it set out to accomplish (get it ""set"" because a large majority of the film takes place on various different film sets). There are three things that are good about this film. The production design, the cinematography, and the dialogue. The rest of the components that create a feature film feel incredibly lackluster. The writing (aside from the dialogue) isn't good, the acting is undistinguished, the editing didn't work, and the directing is disappointing. From a Coen Brothers' film, I would have expected better. I always wondered why no one ever talked about this film, and now I know why: it is forgettable. I watched Hail, Caesar! (2016) yesterday (from when I post this review), and I've already forgotten a lot about it; aside from the three things that are actually quite well done. I even took notes while watching it. It's forgettable. When a film is forgettable, that is not a good sign (it's more that you want to forget about it after viewing the film). Production design. This film excels in creating beautiful sets, settings, and mood. Each of the different stages in the fictional production company's lot (Capitol Pictures) perfectly captures the essence of 50s cinema. Production designer Jess Gonchor did an excellent job in capturing that era in every single set. I got a lot - a lot - of Wes Anderson vibes. Simply because of how vibrant, original, and complex each setting was. The different settings that Gonchor brought to life, really helped this film establish a realistic world. I haven't really talked about production design in any of my reviews, so I hope I sort of explained it well. The role of a production designer is to create the visual look of the story that is being told, and Gonchor's designs make this film look visually pleasing (coupled with Roger Deakins' camera work). But films aren't just about looking beautiful, they have to be compelling, have depth, and engage their audience. This film stands as an example of the fact that films can look gorgeous, but lack true beauty in their story. The story is so incredibly strange. That is part of the Coen Brothers' style, but what made this film strange is the way it jumps around. In terms of genre, tone, and story. There are scenes that drag, and then other scenes that feel two short (it almost makes you question ""why did we just watch this""). On top of that, there really isn't a main plot. There are a couple of main plots. Thinking about it now, this film would have been much better as a TV show. The Coen Brothers try to squeeze so many different stories into one larger story, and it doesn't work. We jump around constantly, from one story to the next, and get lost in what is actually happening. It also jumps genres as a result of the many different stories. From comedy, to drama, to musical, and then back to comedy. If each of the different stories had been their own episodes in the Hail, Caesar! (2016) TV show, I think it would have turned out differently, but instead we get 5+ different complex stories jammed into an hour and forty six minute film. The stories don't have time to truly develop, as they're also edited to be occurring within each other, and the characters don't have time to truly develop either. When characters aren't able to develop, the actors' performances are affected. I expected more from all of the actors in this film. Each and every one of them has had stellar performances before, and in this it is as if they hadn't. They felt like amateurs. This is definitely a result of the writing. It must have been so difficult as an actor to figure out who your character is, and who they grow into, when there is very little to go off of. The best performance of the film was Alden Ehrenreich as Hobie Doyle. He was actually extremely good in his role of Doyle, a country boy turned star who is forced by the studio to change his public image. I thought he was hilarious, having one of the funniest moments in the film, and was able to bring charm to this charmless film. Having actors such as Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and George Clooney would make you think that there would be a lot of charm - but there isn't. Their performances are emotionless, dull, and unsatisfying. Josh Brolin also gives a good performance as the man with all the solutions, Eddie Mannix. He also has some of the funniest moments in the film, and brings a greater level of talent than most of the other cast. Although Hail, Caesar! (2016) has a star-studded cast, the performances aren't as masterful as you would hope. Hail, Caesar! (2016) pays great homage to 50s cinema, whilst making fun of cinema itself, and attempts to tackle issues in the film industry (such as writer unappreciation, public image, Communism , you read that correctly], and talent agnst). It fails from pre-production to create a compelling story, altering actors' performances, and narrative feel as a result. The cinematography, production design, and dialogue are the best parts of the film, but looks aren't everything in Hail, Caesar! (2016)."
" Funny pastiche of bygone Hollywood
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,6,"One scene in particular (saiors in a bar) is brilliant and recreates the atmosphere of old Hollywood musicals to much better effect than the over-hyped LaLa Land. Shows you can't rely on ratings and that there's a lot of follow the herd mentality.Lots of the script is really beautifully balanced. Also Ralph Fiennes is fantastic.The storyline is not particularly strong, but I don't think this matters. Really it;s a sort of loosely connected set of vignettes, lots of which are really well crafted and funny."
" Could have been great
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,4,"The movie starts off fine, good characters, good humor. Then about halfway through I realized that wherever this was going was taking way too long. All of the scenes are really good but there isn't any focus. After the long dance number in the middle my interest was lost for good.The Cohen's seem to be in this rut of trying to be themselves or trying not to be themselves or not like anybody else, I can't really tell. But there is too much trying on their part. Before they naturally wrote their movies and it seems that they are aware of the spotlight or something.Seems like after winning best picture that they've tried not to repeat that move? I don't know, that's an easy time to point at and say it happened here. But ever since then their movies have tried to be outside the box instead of naturally being that way. Buster Scruggs was good for the most part. I hope they find their passion sooner than later."
" Hail, Caesar! Boo, Octavian (or something)
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,8,"Having rewatched this movie, I came to the inescapable conclusion that this is my least-favorite Coen brothers movie (out of 11 watched, soon to be12 once I get around to watching A Serious Man.) Which is absurd, given that I still rate it an 8. The Coen's are masters of their craft.The humor and situations are broad enough that a viewer can pick up on the general references and semi-inside jokes fairly easily with a passing knowledge of Golden Age Hollywood, but much of it still feels like a love note to other film enthusiasts and cinephiles from the Coen brothers, which made it feel a little inaccessible at times, as though we were supposed to find certain aspects hilarious but, without the grounding, we could only muster an awkward chuckle. The extended song-and-dance with the sailors, for instance, seemed too long and elaborate to justify the apparent punchline at the end, so I was left scratching my head, wondering if there was more to it, or if the Coens just wanted to a long musical number for its own sake. Granted, the Coens do riff on lots of genres and cultural eras over the course of their filmography, so this movie neither surprising nor out-of-character. Nevertheless, it felt more like a straight-up comedy of errors that relied on an intimate understanding of the era to bridge the gaps rather than a particularly cohesive narrative set in the period, with big-name stars relegated to what amounted basically to cameos with promises of plotlines that never really stuck.But, dammit, it's still a Coen brothers movie, and better than 90% of the movies out there."
" The perfect paradox
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,9,"How does one pay homage to the golden era of Hollywood and lampoon the golden era of Hollywood simultaneously? The Coen brothers answer that question perfectly with this movie. Not quite as avant-garde as Wes Anderson or níche as so many directors would like to be in their depiction of early Hollywood (L.A. Confidential, I love you, but I'm looking right at you), this film is extremely enjoyable, especially if you grew up with parents who recorded everything they could on VHS (commercials and all)."
" Stands Out For Its Detailed Period Setting and Almost Too Many Moving Parts Made Whole
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,8,"Definitely an Ethan Coen and Joel Coen production, who both directed and wrote the movie. This sparkling period-in-detail movie captures the retro-film pizzazz of the song and dance era as the backdrop to this mild in tone but sharply choreographed thriller comedy drama. The movie introduces a disparate number of song and dance routines that richly envelopes those film scenes along with the stage setting and handlers in which they were shot. At the same time, the narrator proceeds to move the main storyline of the insidious Cold War behind the scenes along with a setting up but never coming directly into blacklisting of movie industry employees. Yet all this is achieved with a serious but light-handed approach, never smartly becoming a parody, one of the most difficult of balancing acts in directing. Josh Brolin's character as a movie mogul in a well-acted performance almost breaks the flowing, entertaining tone of the movie at one point and having to literally repent at another point. There are almost too many moving parts to compress into one movie and perhaps some of the individual storylines and characters get short-shrifted or short-changed for the emotional and substantive depth they individually deserved unlike Pulp Fiction (1994) or Sin City (2005). Nevertheless, the Coen Brothers apparently pulled off a delightful and rather unique theatrical experience that allows this movie to stand out among many."
" A love-letter to 50s Hollywood
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,8,"This movie is a beautiful and sarcastic homage to 1950s Hollywood.
However, it still very much a farce, Coen Bros. style. In the same vein as Big Lebowski, the Hudsucker Proxy, or Burn after Reading this film is blatantly about style and visuals more than substance. And of course the movie acknowledge it itself!There not a lot left to discuss. The story is the weakest element and used more as an excuse to jump from one (scene) film to the other. The style of 50s movie making, is replicated and made fun of. Deconstructed if you will, but not in an accusatory way, but with respect and with, of course, always a quirky twist. I cannot help to think that there is some kind of a meta joke about spending all this time and effort for these brilliant scenes that have no narrative justification, like the sailors dance, or the Would That It Were So Simple scene. They are well-made moments. And they are really funny.The movie is beautiful, and the humour is very good. The music is cool. It is a love-letter to 1950s and for that it work very well. The farcical and ridiculous elements work because they are made with affection. The movie is not mocking its subject, nor the religious faith, nor communism. It is using them to tell jokes. And that is why this movie is so good.My only negative is that it could be more focused, and cleaner on the narrative side of things. Again it does not take away from the rest of the movie. But when you compare them to prior film the Coen bros have done, it feels emptier. The movie is great, I get it the 50s had all the genres: naïve westerns, dancing sailors, swimming sirens, sword-and-sandal epics etc... But nothing really happens in this movie. (Expect maybe Channing Tatum defects to the Soviets but he is not a major character). So you are left wanting more.It came out very closely to two movies having very similar themes and at least settings : Trumbo and Café Society. I believe that watching these three movies you will get the complete idea of the 1950s in Hollywood. And as it happens they all lack something the other has. Trumbo has the true story and actual behind the scenes walk-through, CS has the drama and plastique and Hail Caesar has the spectacle and humour (throw in LA Confidential and you'll also have the thrilling action)."

" A Movie Only Neville Sinclair Could Love!
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,1,"Lots of reviewers have already pointed out how shallow, ugly, tasteless and unfunny this massively annoying little movie really is. What I want to do is examine some of the underlying themes by comparing it to a movie from the early Nineties that I really loved, THE ROCKETEER.These two movies have so much in common, yet they're very different. The Rocketeer was a feelgood popcorn film aimed at a family audience. Hail Caesar is an art house movie aimed at the elite. Yet both of them are period pictures that both spoof and celebrate classic Hollywood. Both movies feature a main character who is supposed to be a legendary movie star, a sexy screen idol at the height of his career. Both Baird Whitlock in Hail Caesar and Neville Sinclair in Rocketeer are quickly revealed to be very different from the heroic characters they play onscreen.So here's where it gets interesting. The bland family movie actually presents a much darker, more disturbing, and arguably more honest look at Hollywood than the hip satire. With Baird Whitlock, the Coen brothers cop out. He's not a bad man, he's just stunningly self-involved, childishly naive, weak and silly. It's purely accidental (and supposedly hilarious) when he gets mixed up with a bunch of Communists trying to infiltrate Hollywood. They kidnap him and lecture him on Communist doctrine. And he sits there. Looking confused. And that's hilarious, really funny. Only not. At all!Now look at Neville Sinclair. He's nobody's pawn. He's a Nazi spy and he likes it. He's genuinely cruel, cunning, sadistic and brutal. He doesn't think twice about hiring mob killers to help him cover up his treason. He revels in his plans to bring down America. And you know what? He's also a sexual predator who very nearly pulls off a Harvey style rape scene with a genuinely innocent and appealing young ingenue. None of that is funny, but see, it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be real, and it is. And it feels even tougher and more honest now than it was in 1991!I'm a big CLOCKWORK ORANGE fan, and I wish that George Clooney and the Coen brothers could be strapped into their seats and forced to viddy THE ROCKETEER over and over again, until they begin to feel very, very sick!"
" Average at best
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,5,Seemed kinda pointless to me but I can't say that I didn't enjoy it. Some parts were dull and some parts were a little less dull. I also had trouble with pacing. This is probably my least favorite Coen movie.

" Not that good
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,4,"Yes, it's a love letter to post-war Hollywood. But that doesn't make 'Hail, Caesar!' a good movie. The scenes are disconnected and overall story arc weak to say the least. Acting is very uneven here. Ehrenreich is great as the singing Western film star. Brolin is good as the ""fixer"". Clooney is passable as the studio's big star. Tilda Swinton, Scarlett Johansson, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum and Ralph Fiennes have all brief appearances, with Fiennes's performence the only one standing out. Not the movie I would recommend, it's better to watch/re-watch one of the previous Coen brothers movies like 'Inside Llewyn Davis' (2013), 'No Country for Old Men' (2007), 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' (2000), 'The Big Lebowski' (1998) or 'Fargo' (1996)."
" ""To Rome!!""
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Great fun. But despite lovingly recreating Hollywood as it looked in the early fifties (along with its movies, although 'Merrily We Dance' looked more thirties) and knowing references to the likes of Norman Taurog, people who would know who Norman Taurog was would soon find themselves set adrift by the general vagueness of the personalities pastiched (possibly to forestall litigation by the next of kin of the real life models).Naming the main character 'Eddie Mannix' (a name that still to me conjures up the early seventies TV series with Mike Connors) is at odds with generally using aliases; but was it caution or simple sloppiness that made the name on his office door 'Edward Mannix' when the real Mannix was actually 'Edgar'?"
" worse than awful
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,1,"I love all the actors that were in this movie but the film itself was horrible. There was barely any story. It was so sad to watch all that money and time spent on such a big production only to end up with something so pointless and boring. When are movie writers going to understand that if it serves no purpose then it should not be in the script?? 90% of this film served no purpose. Zero. None. Nada. Absolutely pointless. Totally, completely irrelevant. Just a waste of my time. Please. Stop. Making. Pointless. Movies. Like. This. One."

" Incidental but Enjoyable Coen Brothers' Film
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,6,"This movie can best be described as a compilation of creative set pieces that the Coen Brothers played around with, loosely tied by a deliberately unrealistic narrative. What makes the movie enjoyable is the good performances and funny jokes throughout it. However, the experience watching it was not as memorable as most other Coen Brothers' movies. The scenes were enjoyable to watch, but nothing really made me feel invested in the story or feel like I was part of its atmosphere. I know the film is meant to be casual and fun, but I think it still could have done more to make each character and setting distinguishable and memorable. An example of a movie that has a similar meandering story set in LA, but with much more memorable characters and dialogue, is one of the Coen Brothers' previous films, The Big Lebowski.
Overall, the movie was fun to watch but didn't leave much else of an impact on me."
" Hail, Caesar! by Wayne J. Keeley
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,5,"You expect certain things from established filmmakers. With the writing, directing producing brothers, Ethan and Joel Coen, creators of such classics as Blood Simple, Barton Fink, Miller's Crossing, Fargo, etc., you expect quirkiness, colorful characters, actors cast against type, Mamet-like dialogue, biting sarcasm and satirical wit. And, I am happy to say, all of those things are found in their latest cinematic endeavor, Hail, Caesar! I am not happy to say that the sum isn't greater than the parts and this film, when stacked against their previous ones, simply does not work.The film consists of several separate stories involving the shameless (and rather petty) trials and tribulations of hailceasar6certain ""stars"" under contract to the fictitious Capitol Pictures in Hollywood circa late 40s/early 50s. The thread of diverse stores are held together by the studio's ""cleaner"" and ""equalizer"" Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin). Mannix has to deal with everything from actor abduction to covering up a pregnancy for the studio's leading lady. Overworked and underpaid Mannix squelches the sins of studio with quick dispatch. Meanwhile, he remains conflicted over his personal venial sins of sneaking cigarettes and lying to his wife about it.The acting was wonderful. Brolin certainly possesses the physical presence to hold the separate pieces of the story together. The ensemble cast made up of name actors and Coen alumni was spot-on; including George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson, Jonah Hill (blink and you'll miss him, yet he is featured on the movie poster - talk about oxymoronic Hollywood), Frances McDormand, etc. I felt like I was watching the classic comedy It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and playing name those cameos. Alden Ehrenreich is terrific as the rodeo champion who is a fish out of water in Hollywoodland. Channing Tatum is especially a standout in a Gene Kelly homage to On The Town. (It's almost worth the price of admission just to see Channing.)So what's the problem? As a whole, the film didn't hold together; it was draggy, at times pedantic and even self-indulgent (during an homage to Esther Williams' mermaid/water dance films, I felt like standing up and saying, ""Alright already! We get it!"" There is only so far you can carry a joke. The predecessor Coen films were quirky, humorous and engaging without being pretentious. Here, it almost seems as if the Coen duo set out to make the most pretentious film possible. I felt as if the filmmakers were hijacked by copycat aliens who endeavored to make a Coen-like film rather than an authentic Coen film.Having directed a satirical comedy in the past about Hollywood (and vowing never to do another one again because of the subjectivity involved), I understand how difficult the genre can be for the filmmaker. The Coen brothers have been amazingly consistent at making engaging, dark satirical comedies. Hail Ceasar!, unfortunately, is not one of them."

" Hail, Caesar! (2016)
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,7,"Directed by Joel & Ethan Coen. Starring Josh Brolin, Alden Ehrenreich, George Clooney, Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, Heather Goldenhersh, Veronica Osorio, Max Baker, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill, Ian Blackman. (PG-13)Eddie Mannix (Brolin) is a tireless 1950s Hollywood fixer handling problems as customary as a director (Fiennes) complaining about a matinee idol (Ehrenreich) being inappropriate for a role, and as outrageous as a communist cell kidnapping a studio star (Clooney) for ransom money. More an assemblage of ""day in the life"" vignettes than a purposeful plot, replete with fine facsimiles of classic Hollywood musical numbers (Busby Berkley and Gene Kelly, the both), Biblical epics, and plenty more; it doesn't add up to much, and some of the sub-plots can get lost in the tangle (Johansson's unwed pregnancy problem is expressed and resolved awfully easily), but it's still pretty fun. Highlights: Ehrenreich's singing cowboy playing in the sandbox of an elegant comedy of manners and Tatum's tap-dancing sailor. Nice period detail, though it's a shame the filmmakers didn't make the movies within the movie look more authentic (notably the film stock color and grain characteristics).73/100"
" 4th time's the charm? Watch it again.

Like The Big Lebowski was for me, it's an acquired taste. Some of the reviews seem to totally miss the point or just not get the heart of it. Some missed the opportunity to truly catch the romance, and I mean Ethan and Joel's lasting love affair with both the art and substance of movie making, and it makes me sad for them. This movie is about the passion and purpose of movie making. It's the ""right thing to do"". That's after all, that's ""what God wants us to do"". Father Ethan and Joel, ""I get it now"".So watch it. And watch again, and maybe watch it again. I hope you find that, like me, maybe you'll begin to fall in love with movies in a deeper, more affectionate way than you ever have before."

" They Probably Didn't Get It
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,10,"I read a bunch of the reviews below on this movie, and I was annoyed because I didn't see one of them who seemed to get what the story was really about. In my opinion, it's a scathing indictment of communism specifically, but it also hints at the immorality of statism in general. While others were annoyed by the silliness of the communists losing the briefcase, I found it to be a deeply satirical representation of the only thing the communists were ever good at: destroying wealth and everything that is good with it, and all for an apparition of an ideal that's as silly as the toy dog it was sacrificed for in the film. The cherry on top for me was when he blames the dog for the mishap, highlighting how willfully ignorant and dense these stubborn adherents are to their own folly.The story finishes off with what I view as an allusion to the immorality of the state as the protagonist confesses his sins and asks for advice from his priest on whether to take a job. He ultimately takes the road less traveled, the one that is right, or moral as it were, and ultimately chooses what is right over what is easy by continuing to work in films. Before I watched this movie I would say it would be a tall order credibly painting a deceptive film-making enterprise as the moral choice, but when it's compared to selling your wares to the military-industrial complex and communist chicanery, the Coens resoundingly convinced me of it.Something I've enjoyed over the years watching Coen Brothers movies is that as I unpeel the onion revealed in each story, upon repeated viewings of course, I notice constant references to philosophy. While I'm not sure based upon their movies that we would see eye-to-eye on philosophy and morality, I'm appreciative of how they subtly discuss them in each film, letting the results of the characters' frequent ignorance of these matters, and the ensuing tragedies that befall them, speak for themselves rather than preaching to the audience what one should do. In other words, it's not prescriptive, but allegorical.Finally I'd like to say that I found the movie to be wildly entertaining. I laughed out loud several times and almost woke my kids up in the process. The spoofing of all those old movies, only some of which I'm familiar with, came through in a very obvious way for me. You can't have seen any of those films and not enjoyed this one poking fun at them. This is storytelling at its finest. Pay attention or you might miss it."

" Of self-love and heartlessness
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,6,"'Hail Caesar' is not the first movie where Joel and Ethan Coen have lovingly curated a pastiche of another world, and then proceeded to make a comedy that isn't really funny because it doesn't have a heart. There really is something wonderful about this over-the-top portrait of 1940s' Hollywood; but its marred by the film's deliberate self-consciousness, from the ridiculous voiceover (as also used in 'The Big Lebowski') downwards. The Coens are often acclaimed, and there's no doubt they have a certain vision; but to my mind, the only film of theirs that worked completely was 'Fargo', where the deadpan comedy of the absurd was matched by a portrait of everyday tenderness. But 'Hail Caesar' feels more like an (admittedly clever) act of self-love."
" What is the point of this movie???
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,3,"Polished, technically competent and nicely shot.
However - utterly devoid of of any meaningful story. The five or six amusing jokes throughout the length of the film were nowhere near enough to rescue this from being just downright boring. It is merely a collection of dead end sub-plots which do not ever really mesh into a whole. Visually slick but without depth, ""Hail Caesar,"" confirmed to me that the Cohn Bros are one of cinemas most overrated concerns."

All the scenes held my attention and the attention to detail on this movie was just crazy. Every featured actor was fantastic. A bundle of very different characters mashed up in Hollywood with all types of different aspirations.I saw this move when it first came out and thought it was just a good Coen brothers movie. I stumbled on YouTube clips last night and stated watching. There were 10 or so clips and what I noticed was each clip of different scenes would all have the same ""best part or scene in the movie"" in the comment section. It was like watching 10 shot movies with different actors knocking it out of the park. I get that plot and story flow are a big deal for some people and this movie can seem like many fragments scattered where the viewer is trying to figure out what's going on. All I can say is watch it one more time. What seemed like good fragments comes together to make what think is my favorite Coen brothers movie.PS. Eschelon's Song by The Red Army Choir is probably the best closing credit song ever and if you don't choose to watch the movie at least YouTube this song for serious inspiration."
" ""Uh, is it hard to dance with all them bananas on your head?""
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Perhaps it helps if one is a connoisseur of movies from the Forties and Fifties; this was a wonderful Coen Brothers send up of a host of film genres with recognizable character references to stars of the past. For starters, there was a real life Eddie Mannix, an American film studio executive and producer for MGM. Josh Brolin does the honors of portraying Mannix, with a full plate of studio problems that require his immediate attention. Tilda Swinton portrays twin gossip columnist sisters, Thora and Thessaly Thacker, and one could reasonably assume the characters represented furious rivals Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, but they weren't actually sisters. So with a little bit of a stretch, you might consider Swinton's portrayals to represent advice columnists Ann Landers and Dear Abby, twin sisters both working under a pen name. Then you have singing cowboy Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) who gets tapped to appear in a serious picture, which for my money, could be a take off on B Western star Tim Holt, who made dozens of pictures in the Forties and proved a very credible actor in the Orson Welles picture, ""The Magnificent Ambersons"". And who wouldn't make the connection between Carlotta Valdez (Veronica Osorio) and that former Brazilian Bombshell, Carmen Miranda, who came to prominence as The Chiquita Banana Girl?So the Coen Brothers take all these disparate film genres and weave a story involving a pregnant movie star (Scarlett Johansson) in a Busby Berkeley styled musical interlude, a B Western crooner who takes it upon himself to solve the kidnapping of Capitol Films' major star (George Clooney) from a Communist kidnapping, and an inspired tribute to Hollywood musicals featuring Channing Tatum as dancing sailor Burt Gurney. You couldn't miss that Gene Kelly connection if you tried, unless of course you're too young to pick up on the reference. Which is kind of a shame, because that's what goes a long way toward getting a ton of enjoyment from this picture.So bottom line, this may not be a movie for everyone, because the spoofs go back some seventy years or so, and without the experience of all those old time stars and glorious black and white films of the past, the story might leave you scratching your head. No doubt this was a Coen Brothers labor of love, so for that one ought to be grateful, as I've never seen a Coen Brothers film I didn't like. Some better than others of course, and this one might be in the middle regarding their total output, but still, I could watch it any day of the week and be highly entertained."
" Nothing really happens.
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,5,"As a fan of the Coen Brothers work, I have to admit to being a little let down by this entry. To me, this film was love letter to Hollywood that seemed to forget to have an actual story around the various odes to classic cinema that surrounds it. There are some attempted funny moments, and the film sure is gorges to look at, as one would expect from something put together from Roger Deakins. It does for sure make itself highly respectful to that golden age Hollywood scene, capturing all the magic and the wonder that was in cinema at that time, and I always enjoy peeking behind the curtian to see the inner makings. We also have a large cast of good actors attempting to make it all work.Where this film falls flat is all down to the writing. Basically, there is no story to this movie, at least, not a very good or memorable one, it does not get above the flash, it always loses flair. There are attempts to make commentary on the red threat which was big in Hollywood at that time, but they really do nothing with it, and all the odes feel quite forced and shoved in. It is all very surface.This is a well made movie. A well acted movie. Basically everything in this movie works except the storytelling, which needs to be strong, to a certain level, for it all to bookend."

" Left me flat at first
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,7,"Watching it for the first time on DVD, it left me flat at first. As one who enjoys inside Hollywood humor, there were a number of laughs, but not as many as I expected. Then after thinking it over and watching some of the bonus features, a new view came to mind. Eddie Mannix, as played by Brolin, comes across much more sympathetic that one would think, given his reputation as a ruthless fixer at MGM, which had two goals - make tons of money, and look wholesome while doing it. Studios needed people like Mannix, because the talent end of the movie business has been the same from the days of Chaplin to now - a great number of spoiled, petulant children who can't seem to control themselves or their egos. If there wasn't someone like a Mannix keeping the stars in the studio daycare in line and protected, it would be an absolute miracle anything actually got done. True, Mannix appeared to have some affection for the stars he had to occasionally put the thumbscrews to, but his overall loyalty was to the dollars and cents and the protection of his bosses. They trusted him to get things done, and he did it. He's the man who helped protect the images we looked up to. By looking only at the excellent re-creations of classic Hollywood genres, one could miss the story of how Mannix was responsible for keeping everything going. If the movie was called ""The Fixer"", and we had a few more scenes indicating the pressure the owners in New York put him under, it might have been clearer that this was a film about who had the power in Hollywood. Not so much the stars, but the owners and their muscle men. At least the Mannix played by Brolin appeared to have some personal struggles with what he had to do. Not too bad a film if you watch it that way."

" Movies Within a Movie: Only the Coen Bros Could Zing 1950's Hollywood Culture: All the World's a Movie
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,8,"From the very beginning of film as manufactured entertainments to be consumed not unlike candy and popcorn until circa 1965, the Hollywood studios were giant movie factories. They cranked out films like the latest dessert or candy bar to be quickly devoured and ingested until the next time. The studios were often making multiple films on different sound stages. When television became serious competition for entertainment seekers in the 1950's, the studios fought back by making large epic pictures in a new format: Cinemascope, a widescreen format which could not be accommodated by current television technology. Cinemascope films often took place in ancient times: ""The Robe"", ""Ben Hur"", and ""The Ten Commandments"". (Only by circa 1990 did some films begin appearing on VHS tape in their original widescreen formats.)The Coen brothers attack the old Hollywood studio system and culture with the subtlety of a hacksaw and apply it to pre-1960 Hollywood like King Kong escaping from his bonds. Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is a ""movie star"" in the old pre-Marlon Brando sense. He plays over-the-top characters in love stories and epics, not just to please cinema-goers who like the stories of his films, but also his adoring fans who will pay the box office to watch whatever he stars in. He's currently in ""Hail, Caesar!"" (undoubtedly similar to ""The Robe"", the first ever Cinemascope movie, and ""Ben Hur"") as a centurion who will experience the humanity and divinity of Christ in ancient Palestine.Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a movie mogul probably modeled after Louis B. Mayer (who executive produced MGM musicals) and Darryl F. Zanuck (producer of ""Gone with the Wind""). The actors under contract under the studio Capitol Pictures are his chess pieces, and he moves them around from film-to-film, the studio being like a giant chess board. Mannix assigns his actors and directors at will. But he not only controls the projects; he also governs the lives of the Hollywood people. He determines who will go with whom to film premiers, and even occasionally gets involved with directing their person lives in terms of marriages and families. (In point of fact, Tarzan actor Johnny Weissmuller was forced by the studios to divorce his wife. The conventional wisdom: female audiences would be less interested in attending his Tarzan films if they knew he was married and unavailable.)The film ""Hail Caesar"" is only a few scenes away from completion, but their star, Whitlock has been kidnapped! Interspersed with this plot are sequences in which we view other films being shot. In particular we meet a country-western airhead who is playing in musical westerns. He's tapped by the studio to play a supporting character in a sophisticated costume drama which has dire consequences! We also see a bar scene in a movie musical being shot where all the off-duty sailors break into song and dance! In the meantime, a horrid stand-in takes the place of Whitlock, and they shoot his scenes with his back to the camera!While most critics enjoyed this scathing reality check of Hollywood culture, general movie goers were less than enthusiastic. There are many in-jokes about the entertainment industry, not all of them flattering, some of them sobering. In some scenes which are supposed to be ""real life"", the scenes look like film shots, particularly with the sky appearing more like a painting than real. I think the point the Coen brothers are making is that the entire Hollywood world is an endless movie in and of itself. Especially when you consider the gossip columnists who endlessly used their pens like swords to expose the latest scandalous behavior behind the scenes. A really fun movie if you understand the unreality of Show Biz. All the world's a movie, without the credits!"
" Working more as a history lesson in film than a straight-up comedy.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,5,"I like movies as much as the next connoisseur of film, but clearly the Coen Brothers like them more than I do. Specifically, they like the films made during the ""golden age"" of Hollywood: the 1950's. From action-packed westerns, to Biblical epics, to underwater choreography, to big-budget musicals, these films exemplified a Hollywood that was on top of its game. Unfortunately, as is the case with any great success, it can be hard to maintain over time. In what could be considered a ""love letter"" to a Hollywood of the past, the Coen Brothers bring all these films together in Hail, Caesar! (2016).While I could appreciate the references made throughout this film, many of them felt quite disjointed. Sure, there's the tie-in to real-life Hollywood fixer, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin), but he merely acts as a link between scenes of grandeur meant to show how well the Coen Brothers can follow the homages of the famous films they're parodying. In fact, some of these segments are almost uncomfortably long, with little point other than to show off a well-known genre or style (or to beat a joke to death). As a result, the pacing of this film feels quite staggered and the plot on the light side.Admittedly, Hail, Caesar! is fun, with some good bits interspersed throughout. The ""red scare"" starting to gain relevance in the timeframe leads to quite a bit of comedy, the meeting to ensure nobody is ""offended"" is hilarious, and even some of the film segments are amusing as well. We do get to Channing Tatum's singing and dancing skills on full display in this film, but it's hardly enough to save it from itself. Don't get me wrong, I appreciated what the Coen Brothers were trying to do here (and it wasn't necessarily to poke fun at Ben-Hur (1959)), but it never felt coherent enough to be good.Working more as a history lesson in film than a straight-up comedy, I give Hail, Caesar! 2.5 stars out of 5."
" Big cast no laughs

" A blonde bimbo of a film which looks good but has little substance
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,5,"A good looking film; jam packed with some real celebrity A-listers, in a tongue in cheek look at a side of the classic Hollywood studio system in the 1950's. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is a 'fixer' for a studio; his job is to keep the stars in-line, safe and happy. They are after all, the main commodity to making 'pictures'! His job is a tough one, but he's good at it, and while he complains, he does actually like it too. While simultaneously solving various issues the studios main star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is kidnapped by communist's screenwriters from the set up Hail! Cesar - the years big budget blockbuster. Mannix has to sort this out along with the myriad of other problems around him.Directed by the Coen brothers this is a film I really wanted to like, but it doesn't seem to have a clear destination or journey, it's a jumble of things all thrown up in the air. Sure it looked pretty, and had a top cast, but it lacked something that left me expecting a twist or an improvement every couple of minutes - and it just didn't come.At best I can only give this a 5 because it was mildly entertaining to me as somebody who has studied the classic Hollywood studio system - but beyond that, it didn't entertain much and the plot was pretty weak."

" A cryptic crossword of a movie
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,8,"A friend came into the room about ten minutes after I'd started watching this and I had to explain it to her: so Josh Brolin is a devout Catholic Hollywood studio fixer who's got to replace the star in a movie but the only actor available is a trick-riding singing cowboy who can't act; meanwhile he has to cover up the out-of-wedlock pregnancy of a musical-swimming star, field two Tilda Swinton columnists and give up smoking. Then George Clooney, star of ""Hail, Caesar!"", a sort of Victor Mature sword'n'sandals epic. gets kidnapped by a communist writers' study group.It's a good job she came in when she did because any later and this movie would be impossible to explain any more - as it is, there are several threads running though it, and the Coens throw in a few more.It's beautifully made, entertaining, witty and funny by turns, but you do get the feeling that the brainstorm session(s) that put it together might have been a little overenthusiastic; Hail, Caesar! has a bit of everything in it and you find yourself trying to pick up the references more than feeling any suspense. As Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) soon makes friends with his kidnappers, that plot turn is completely defused. Then there's a tremendous ""On The Town"" type dance number, complete with outrageous double-entendres, but it outstays its welcome as its relevance to the plot (and it is relevant) isn't apparent at the time.The Coens being slightly self-indulgent is still better than 90% of mainstream Hollywood, anyway."
" A bunch of half-baked ideas jumbled together
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,5,"Hail, Caesar! is amusing. However, it's not the same level of entertainment I expect from a Coen Brothers film.

" Plot Fails to Fully Deliver
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)Another one of those movies about the movie industry in the golden era; the 50s. A main figurehead at Capitol Studios spends the movie trying to deal with and appease big star actors, keep movie budgets under control, free a kidnapped star by Communists and deal with the media. The Coen Brothers tried their approach of a humorous, sprawling and plotless film but sadly it failed to have the same great impact of many of their previous films. Perhaps they tried to include too many story lines that they were all to thin, which lacked the depth and meat that makes his past films memorable. A quality production with less than anticipated intrigue and impact."
" Not funny
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,2,"If you have a lot of money, you can make a movie. Because you can doesn't mean you should.

" Very enjoyable mish-mash, but there is something missing despite the stellar cast
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,8,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I have owned it for a couple of months but did not sit down to watch until now. It is an excellently crafted film - the acting is superb (especially from the always brilliant Josh Brolin, from Alden Ehrenreich when he pretends to be an actor who cannot act, from Ralph Feinnes as he pretends to cope with an actor who cannot act, and from George Clooney), the visualisation of 1950s Hollywood is lush and has a certain largesse, BUT there is something missing - I cannot quite put my finger on it.
The concept in itself is enjoyable - the whole film revolves around a Hollywood fixer (Brolin) who is caught between his loyalty to his present employment and a more lucrative and more family-friendly role with an aeroplane manufacturer (go on, guess which one). He is currently dealing with a film concerning the life of Christ (hence, Hail. Caesar, the name of that film) and has to ensure that no-one in the American market will be offended (watch out for the brilliant scene with an Orthodox priest, a presbyter of some form, a rabbi and a Catholic Priest deciding if the script is offensive). Then suddenly the main character (Clooney as a Charlton Heston-style Roman tribune) is kidnapped by undesirables. That, essentially, is the plot and how it develops is the story. It lacks oomph, but is brilliantly played - it is memorable, but what exactly is the message that comes out through it all? There are several lovely moments, especially in the editing suite, and the score blends in so perfectly that it almost unnoticed. I laughed to notice that one of the first prizes awarded was for the hairdressing involved.
The acting and visualisation are both superb, so I have to give it 8/10, but there is something indefinable missing that stops it being a 9 or a 10."

It's a playful tease on institutional dogma.
They gently point out the foibles of major religions and business cultures of 1951.
They reference their own films constantly and use their famous mirroring of symbolic images and scenes to connect dots ...
or at least create the dots for us to connect.

" A fun look at Hollywood's 'Golden Age'
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,8,"This film gives us a look at one day in the lives of those working for a Hollywood studio in the 1950s. Mostly it focuses on fixer Eddie Mannix who links various stories involving various film stars. Most prominent amongst these are the kidnapping of Baird Whitlock, the lead in a new Biblical epic, by communists; western star Hobie Doyle being asked to appear in a classy drama which demands skills he doesn't have and actress DeeAnna Moran who is pregnant but not married. During the course of the film we also see scenes from the films the characters are making; these include a song and dance routine, a spectacular display of synchronised swimming and a comical western scene.This film from the Cohen Brothers is part homage, part tongue-in-cheek jab at Hollywood's golden age when studios churned out westerns, made spectacular musicals and the biggest films were epics set in biblical times. The studios micromanage their stars to ensure their public images are squeaky clean and even serious failings are covered up. This is all done in a way that provides plenty of laughs; I loved Alden Ehrenreich's cowboy as he struggles in a new role as a far more sophisticated character and George Clooney's leading man, in full Roman uniform, as he is kidnapped by communists. There are some fun little twists as we learn more about the characters. The cast are clearly having fun; thankfully in a way that is fun for the audience too. The story is fairly light but that doesn't matter as it is more about the fun moments than a deep plot. Overall fans of the Cohens' lighter fare should enjoy this."

I actually rate this lower than the room because no parts I could laugh at and it was so slow and nothing saved it for me. I felt like I was in the movie theater watching this for 3 hours instead of almost 2. I remember very little from this movie because I tried to block it from my memory so hard."

" If Only I Could Give It A 6.7
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,6,"I am tempted to give it a higher score simply because of how I love the way the Coen Brothers craft their movies. This one has that classic touch of theirs: the scenes are meticulously staged, the dialogue is precise, the humor and commentary is perfectly delivered, each shot feels like an illustration, and the casting is on point.Despite all of this, and many memorable moments throughout the film, it just seems like it was aiming to be so much more. I did, however, thoroughly enjoy its ending for it drove home a message that I think is quite important."

" Too episodic
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,7,"I usually like the work of the Coen Brothers, and I quite like this movie, too. But it's somewhat lacking in coherence, it's too episodic. Some wonderful and funny episodes, but a thin story. The main character isn't that interesting. And it ends rather abruptly, somewhat unsatisfying in my opinion."
" Just a little piece of Hollywood under the magnifying glass
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,4,"""Hail Caesar"" is billed as a comedy and mystery, but is mostly a satire of Hollywood. It has very little humor in the dialog, and unless one knows history, much of the plot may not make sense. That includes American history of the mid-20th century, and knowledge about Hollywood in the first half of the last century. With some knowledge in those areas, one can follow the plot and appreciate the humor in the exaggerated scenarios. An example of the latter is when some of the Hollywood communist cell take a small boat to deliver an agent and the ransom money to a Soviet submarine that surfaces off the coast of California. The film covers some of the culture of Hollywood at mid-20th century. But also omits mention of much of it that became known over time. Hollywood had many a scandal over drugs, crime and sex. In the main character, Eddie Mannix (played by Josh Brolin), the film tends to idolize the studio head. It puts Mannix on a pedestal for his 18-hour workdays, seven days a week, in which he holds the studio together. So, all of what Mannix does is whitewashed as essential to protect the stars, the studios, etc. One interesting inclusion is Tilda Swinton who plays sisters Thora Thacker and Thessaly Thacker. They are supposed to be Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper, who were not real sisters. They were the famous Hollywood gossip columnists since the early 1930s. The little stories that Mannix has to play them to print or not print pale compared to the real stuff that the two rival columnists produced, publicized, promoted or buried. Other things about Hollywood of the time are barely mentioned or not at all. The assaults and murders, suicides and mysterious deaths, adulterous affairs, alcoholism and drug use, car accidents and many other real troubles that actors got into and that Hollywood tried to covere up. There's no mention here of the sex exploits of some studio heads with young actresses that could determine their careers. Enough real news and exposes have come out of Hollywood since before the mid-20th century, to conclude that Hollywood was a sordid sector of society. So, that's a list of some of the usual goings-on in and around Hollywood at least into the mid-20th century. This film skips or skims over much of that, but not all. It does have a pregnancy out of wedlock that is covered up, with a twist so that it doesn't look exactly like a couple of real instances. Instead, the Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, take aim at the mid-20h century. And specifically, the time of the communist scares and type of film output from Hollywood then. It's somewhat of a social agenda about Hollywood kowtowing to the politics of the day. This is where some knowledge of history helps one follow the script. The House Un-American Activities Committee was investigating the influence of Communism in the entertainment field. The period was often labeled the McCarthy era, after Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy who said that communists infiltrated the U.S. State Department in numbers, and were gaining control throughout government. McCarthy had phony lists and in the end could produce very few names in support of his claims.But, public concern was fanned when real Soviet spies were caught or uncovered and Soviet individuals began defecting. This was happening in the U.S. England, Canada and other Western countries. A 1948 movie, ""The Iron Curtain"" is the story of a Soviet code worker in the U.S.S.R. embassy in Canada who defected. He provided information that uncovered an extensive Soviet espionage network in Canada and the U.S. It had been stealing American atomic secrets since the end of World War II. In 1953, the U.S. executed Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for their spy activities for the Soviet Union. As with most events in history, some people thought the Rosenbergs were innocent or had been railroaded. But much evidence was uncovered in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union that detailed the great amount of espionage they had done for the U.S.S.R. 
 
This time also was at the height of the Cold War when tensions between the Soviet Union and the West were near fever pitch. At the end of World War II, the Soviet Union controlled Eastern Europe. So most of those countries were under communist rule and weren't free until after the 1990 collapse of the U.S.S.R. The nuclear arms race was on between the Soviets and the U.S. Those who lived during that time well remember the air raid drills in the schools. By 1962, the U.S. and Russia would be near a nuclear war when Pres. John Kennedy ordered a naval roadblock to stock the Soviets from installing nuclear missiles in Cuba aimed at the U.S. I can't imagine that people without much knowledge of history would find this entertaining or be able to make much sense of it. As one who remembers the political history, I found ""Hail, Caesar"" just somewhat interesting. It was a recap of some bits of Hollywood history. But, it gosed over the real scandals The plot with the studio magnate, Mannix, seemed somewhat contrived. Yet, one could see it was needed to connect the rest of the parts of the film. With very little humor, this movie soon becomes tiring. That's not a very good recommendation for any movie.The funniest line in the film was by Hobie Doyle, the Western star, played by Alden Ehrenreich. Carlotta Valdez (Veronica Osorio) asks him, ""How did you get into pictures, Hobie?"" He replies, ""Got roped into it."""
" It's complicated
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,8,"The film takes place circa 1951 and centers on Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) a film producer for Capitol Films. He is faced with a number of issues which he must solve while trying to give up smoking. His main headache is Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) the star of his epic film ""Hail Caesar."" He has been kidnapped and ransomed by a communist cell during film production. Meanwhile he he forced to miscast cowboy star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) who can't act in a societal comedy/drama.The feature spoofs the gloss and crap that came from that era as films had a monopoly on entertainment. We see a Carmen Miranda type (Veronica Osorio), Channing Tatum dancing like Gene Kelly in ""Anchors Away""; Scarlett Johansson as Esther Williams in ""Million Dollar Mermaid"" and George Clooney plays a Richard Burton type in ""The Robe."" Hobie Doyle was a generic singing cowboy with a ""Gabby Hayes"" sidekick.The Coen film holds some enjoyment for those familiar with the era. There were some good exchanges such as the theological debate and Jonah Hill taking about being a professional person-hood. It comically shows the Hollywood 10 black listed doing unorthodox things. The main problem with this feature is that it is a Coen Brothers film, so the bar has been set Raising Arizona high. If this was a new director/writer they would be hailed as genius.Guide: No F-words, sex, or nudity."

If you notice how many really big names appear throughout the movie it gives you an impression of the reputation the Coen brothers have in Hollywood. This one surely isn't their best work so far but still I find it better than many of the ratings here would suggest. Even though there's not a huge story (which actually is the case in many other Coen films as well), I felt entertained and eager to know how things will turn out in the end. There's a fine sense of humour surrounding the way Hollywood is depicted here that breathes the love for cinema that motivates the producers. The acting of course is fantastic and these points add up in my opinion to make a decent film.All in all this is nothing you mustn't miss but it is a very nice addition to Hollywood cinema. Just give it a try and judge for yourself and you'll be probably surprised in a positive way."

Sadly, i was extremely let down by a movie that had no charm, not wit and no humor. I enjoyed many earlier Coen brothers' movies including Raising Arizona, Hudsucker Proxy, Intolerable Cruelty and Burn After Reading, so maybe i had high expectations. This one was however dismally trite. The only actor who provided a bright spark was Channing Tatum. Unlike the classics from that period, Hail, Caesar! will not stand the test of time."

But that's pretty much all it's got going for it. First off, there's no story. None, and Clooney's being seduced by commie screenwriters is not a story. Then...what decade is this? Brolin uses a 1930s phone, the musical numbers are MGM late 1940s, and there's a singing cowboy star who would not be a star in the 1940s. THEN - the pastiche numbers. I've seen lots of Gene Kelly/sailor dancing films. Basically, I kept waiting for a movie to start. One never did."
" OK - just not too much substance
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"The premise for 'Hail, Caesar!' sounds more ""meta"" than it is - a film studio in the 1950's making a Roman/Jesus epic called 'Hail Caesar' and starring Whitlock (Clooney), the biggest Hollywood star. The film works as a tribute to classic movie-making, with Brolin playing Mannix, the head of ""Capitol Studios"", trying to keep his sometime wayward stars in check.The film nails the choreography and massive scale the soundstages had, especially with Johansson's mermaid scene and Tatum's tap-dancing sailor scene. Surprise - he can also sing! Probably the funniest moment is new guy Doyle (Ehrenreich)'s cowboy scene and stunts. Unfortunately, there's no real plot other than Clooney getting kidnapped by kind Communists - doesn't really go anywhere.Fiennes, Johansson, Hill, Tatum & McDormand all don't have enough screen time. The score is good and there's some jokes, although most of them are more like a sly wink to the audience - definitely not the Coen's best work! The score's good and Clooney and Tatum both ham it up, but I definitely felt underwhelmed afterwards."

It may not be the Coen brothers' best ever, but it doesn't have to be to be enjoyable."

",2017-12-04 00:00:00,8,"This Coen Brothers' movie has a lot of detractors but I found it quite funny, as various stereotypes from the twilight of Hollywood's Golden Age deal with personal problems (usually involving 'vices'), production problems (trying to wrap a mega-budget ""Sword and Sandal"" epic) and the Communist scourge (including a dog named ""Engels""). Interspersed are satires of the era's great flamboyant excesses (including an Ester Williams style water-ballet, a Gene Kelly style song and dance routine, and an over-the-top singing-cowboy Western). These 'films-within-film"" are (IMO) the best part of ""Hail, Caesar"", although I found the thin 'plot' tying it all together to be entertaining as well. I would have thought that the film would be great fun for any movie buff, but judging by the IMDb reviews, my enthusiasm is far from universally shared. Worth starting anyway - you'll likely decide which camp you're in pretty quickly (but I recommend that you stay long enough for the 'Swinging Dinghy' musical number)."
" Not too funny as its been said
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,4,"Hail, Caesar! is another Coen Brothers film and this film takes place during the 1950's. Described as a comedy, though this film's humor is very much subjective as most of what is occurring isn't quite funny. No laughs, but some decent scenes by the musicals and overall chemistry of the cast. Hail, Caesar may be considered one of the Coen Brothers more disappointing films as this film had much hype surrounding it leading up to its release, especially considering the cast. Though the highlight of the film is the character of relatively new comer and future star Alden Ehrenreich. The leads of Josh Brolin and George Clooney play their typical act. Scarlett, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill don't have as much screen time as their names were advertised. It did not produce as well at the box office as the studios expected and it appears this film was not as successful or liked among movie goers. This is more of a required taste but one can understand why many reviews are saying it is boring and doesn't offer much of interest. One take is that this film tries too hard at being funny and different that it misses the mark, and the overall plot of the film and setting isn't too engaging."
" Not much of a plot, but still fun
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,6,"The Coen Brother's star-studded film, Hail, Caesar! jumps into the backseat with golden-age Hollywood, but fails to measure up to its inspiration. The plot jumps around a lot, and really seems to just be an excuse for the directors to shoot multiple scenes reminiscent of older films (Ben Hur, The Robe, Anchors Away, Ricky Nelson films, etc.). There are many funny moments, but there is little cohesion to them, and it is easy to get lost. With an all-star cast, including Jonah Hill, George Clooney, Channing Tatum, and Scarlett Johansson, it would've been nice to see more well- rounded characters. Channing Tatum's character seems to have only been included to prove that Channing Tatum can sing. In fact, most of the characters seem to contribute little to the plot at all. All this being said, the movie is fun. It is light hearted and enjoyable. The plot may have more detours than a cross-country drive, but each detour has a charm all its own. Best advice: don't worry about the plot, just enjoy each scene for what it is."
" Self-amused pastiche
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,3,"Production head at fictional Capitol Pictures in 1950s Hollywood is forced to pay ransom on the star of his latest Roman Sandals epic after the perplexed actor is drugged and abducted by a Communist organization; meanwhile, production continues on a sailor musical, a water ballet (with a pregnant, unmarried starlet) and a black-and-white romance featuring the studio's number-one cowboy star out of his element. Written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, ""Hail, Caesar!"" gives off the impression of film school students running rampant with a huge bankroll. It's a well-produced, fast-paced comedy, but one that offers little more than select episodes reproduced from the movie-memories of two brothers who have watched a lot of TV, attended a lot of film retrospectives, who have the look and flip talk of the '50s classics down pat, but who possess such a dry sense of humor that they may be the only two laughing. Scarlett Johansson has a great bit in a mermaid's tail, Tilda Swinton is spot-on playing twin sister reporters who write competing entertainment columns, and Channing Tatum does a sweet Gene Kelly-like dance routine. Unfortunately, much of the ""plot"" concerns James Brolin and George Clooney, neither of whom finds their comic groove here. *1/2 from ****"

" Just a terrible movie.
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,1,"It was just on HBO and my wife and I decided it was going to be our choice for movie night last night. It was literally the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot was slow and barely there, the writing was terrible, and the directing tied nothing together. Even the acting was stupid and forced, I can't believe these actors would even sign on for this...and Scarlett wisely disappears rather quickly, like she was just in it as a favor. Like troopers we made it through to the end (well, i did...my wife got up and started cooking in the kitchen, she just couldn't take it anymore) and even the ending was pointless and went no where. I don't think you could have made a less interesting film if you tried. Straight to DVD and deservingly so."
" Incredibly rewarding for fans of classic Hollywood
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,8,"A rambling shaggy dog story set in Hollywood of the 1950's ... a movie star (George Clooney) is kidnapped off the set of a Biblical epic he's starring in. There are a couple of distinct but related subplots, and all of it ties back to studio exec Josh Brolin trying to put out all the fires while considering a better job offer from Lockheed. Every once in a while, the Coens make a film simply because it amuses them and allows them to exercise their love of classic Hollywood. This is one of those. They stage multiple scenes from films being made by this studio ... musicals, westerns, comedies, epics ... and each is a meticulously recreated pastiche of a 50's film. If you're on their wavelength, it's immensely rewarding. If you're not, it's a bunch of stars gathered together for a plot that ultimately goes almost nowhere. I'm in the first camp ... I loved this."
" Pleasantly surprised! Definitely not a lough out loud comedy.
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,8,"I would have thought it was a bad movie from some of the reviews I read, but I think it tells its story very well without taking itself too seriously.

A Tale of the Christ is a slight but subversive tale of Hollywood's role as the soft power of the US of A's own imperial project, Plot and themes are gloriously upstaged by the film's pastiche of Hollywood's kitsch excesses. There's synchronised swimming, a saucy sailors' song and dance routine, crooning cowboys, and some great cameos: George Clooney stars as a malleable, dumb beefcake actor; Ralph Fiennes as a dilettante Old World director aghast at the crassness of the studio's latest protégé; Frances Macdormand as a jaded, chain smoking editor. But it is Alden Caleb Ehrenreich who steals the show as the studio's very own singing cowboy. A slight film when all is said and done, it is nonetheless beautifully rendered and fabulously silly - and it also features The Christ in a blonde wig"

",2017-06-19 00:00:00,3,"I REALLY try and see the good in a movie. Really. And it's the Coen brothers so you can expect wacky. The production is ""lush"" - made to look like 1950's color film, set in a Hollywood studio and trying to reflect the era. A lot of plot elements get laid out and I kept waiting for them to all get brought together in some great denouement. Never happened - well not in some meaningful way.Not quite a waste of money - but don't recommend it."
" So much hope, but no substance
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,3,"So many amazing actors and well shot scenes, but almost no substance. The movie was so dull, jokes fell flat before they even had a chance. The movie was well shot and the actors gave it their all. The dialogue seemed like filler through the entirety of the film. The story didn't seem to progress at all throughout the film. It tried to do too much and failed on all accounts. Just 3/10 seeing as the acting was fair and the cinematography was great."
" Oh Coen brothers, what have you done.... and why?
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,2,"I am a fan of the Coen brother's films in general, but they can get lost in an idea. This was definitely one of those films. When it ended, all I could say was ""What???"" Seriously, only one of the 'story lines' concludes with anything more thought out than ""Good enough, next!"" The only reason it satisfied at all was because it was the only one that involved the only actual character. This is yet another Hollywood jerk off. Don't waste your time."
" A movie about something important
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,10,"I loved what this movie had to say about integrity and commitment and serving art with passion. About not taking the easy road, but finding satisfaction in doing what you were made to do. That the deep thinkers aren't always the ones with common sense and how art can use a simple but talented individual whether he realizes it or not. The movie's funny, quirky, imperfect characters only drove the point home more. It's one of my favorite go-to movies when I need a good laugh and a feeling of satisfaction."
" Worth watching?
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,7,"This is my first review here, and I hope to do more. I have noticed a niche that can use more contributions, namely, reviews written by people who love movies, but who are not trying to prove how terribly clever and smart they are. Many years ago one of the major movie critics wrote for a metropolitan newspaper, and he had a funny list of categories for movies, the best one being 'worth watching if you're home sick.' His reviews helped me think about why some deeply flawed movies are worth watching, while some highly praised films are simply, for most of us, pretentious junk. 'Hail, Caesar!' is one of the former. First and foremost, any movie that makes you laugh, laugh a lot, is certainly worth your time. The main criticism I have is that it doesn't hang together well. The skits are related, but there is not enough of a strong narrative thread here to pull you through to the end, to give you that sense of 'wow' that a really good movie gives you. The casting is intriguing, with flashes of brilliance. George Clooney is a smart choice; he gave me much to think about regarding the interaction of skill and charisma in a performance. I was also wondering how Josh Brolin made his character likable. And Scarlett Johansson's first appearance is very amusing, as well as one of the movie's many reminders of the sharp contrast between movie fantasies, and the quotidian of our lives that drives us to seek out that very fantasy.So, to steal from the above-mentioned reviewer, 'worth watching at home.'"
" Swing and a Miss
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,4,"I wanted to like this movie, but just never connected with any of the characters. There were a few interesting/chuckle-worthy moments like when an actor would give a beautiful speech then forget a line; the sense of deflation and annoyance around the set would be palpable. But, IDK, the directors jumped in hip-deep too quickly and Josh Brolin was acting at 100 MPH before viewers even had a chance to get settled in.The Coen's revisited some of their old motifs (voice-over narration, George Clooney acting clueless, etc.), but none of it worked this time, IMO.And, the whole Communist subplot was pointless. All those writers exposing themselves to kidnapping charges to extract some ransom money, which, once acquired is accidentally pitched into the sea. That about summed up the movie as a whole."
" HAIL, CAESAR! is One of the Funniest Movies of 2016
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,8,"The Coen brothers bring us back to the golden age of the Hollywood studio system with their 2016 comedy HAIL, CAESAR! On the scale of Coen comedies, I find this one is more entertaining than BURN AFTER READING but never reaches the heights of their (in my opinion) best, THE BIG LEBOWSKI. It's an easy watch with a relatively simple story that relies a bit on the viewer having either nostalgia for 1950s era Hollywood movies or an appreciation for the studio system of decades ago. I fall into the latter category, loving this frenetic voyage back to the 1950s where we're to tag along with studio head Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) to witness a day in his life as he juggles problem after problem. Mannix is an honorable man with boundless loyalty to the studio but the stress has taken its toll on him. As the film begins, he receives an order from the men above him to move famed musical cowboy Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) to the studio's latest period drama, much to the classical director's extreme dismay. Meanwhile the studio's star synchronized swimmer DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) has become pregnant out of wedlock, which could become a PR disaster, and the lead actor (George Clooney) from the studio's biblical epic, the titular HAIL, CAESAR!, has gone missing. Mannix races to solve these problems while fending off twin Hollywood reporters (Tilda Swinton in a dual role) eager to break a story that might damage the studio's delicate reputation.I found this movie to be indescribably fun. It's got a manic pacing that races you through from start to finish and encourages further viewings to catch jokes you might've missed the first time. It's a bright, colorful adventure through the eyes of the over-worked Mannix who moves from issue to issue without missing a beat. It's full of fast-talkers and oddball characters. If I were to complain about anything, it would be that there's so many interesting scenarios playing out over the course of the movie that we didn't get enough time to thoroughly dig in. The Hobie Doyle issue, where a simple cowpoke finds himself tossed into the stiffest of dramas with an auteur director (played by Ralph Fiennes) who is equally panicked at having to somehow teach his new star how to show some class, has some of the funniest moments in the movie but it's relegated to a secondary plot. I could watch an entire movie on that situation alone. Give Ehrenreich and Fiennes a spin off film documenting the making of that movie-within-a-movie. The primary plot thread, obviously, is the abduction of the studio's biggest star Baird Whitlock from the set of HAIL, CAESAR! Clooney can play aloof with the best of them and he's got a comedic timing that isn't put on display nearly often enough. His Whitlock awakens from his abduction in a gorgeous seaside home surrounded by strange men and, not only rolls with it, he comes to believe in their mysterious cause.Much of the film's fun comes from the madcap journey behind the scenes of the movie studio system of the 50s. Mannix's business takes him behind the scenes of a massive synchronized swimming sequence (a relic of decades past) and, more interestingly, a Hollywood musical. We get an entire song and dance sequence featuring Channing Tatum as the star of an old Navy musical where he and a team of sailors lament their future lack of dames on the high seas to an upbeat tune. I thought it was interesting to see what sort of stuff went into the choreography and camera blocking. It's fun. Everything about this movie is a blast and it's a shame to see it didn't receive a whole lot of love from audiences. I guess you need to have at least a passing interest in the subject matter to find the entertainment here, otherwise it must come across as a lot of fast-talking gibberish laid over a scatter-brained plot that can't seem to find its focus. I wholeheartedly disagree, as I've found HAIL, CAESAR! to be massively re-watchable and I've yet to find myself bored with it. It has a contagious positive vibe in this love letter to a Golden Age of film. Coen fans should find plenty to appreciate here and I hope more casual fans or less-informed mainstream audiences will give the film a chance and find something to enjoy as well, whether it be the performances, the production, or the sense of humor."
" Devious
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,9,"The Coen brothers are geniuses and they once again show it in ""Hail Caesar"". The movie suffers as the directors use it as a mean to an end. What exists is a collage of scenes, with little holding them together and a script that lacks a plot in the classical sense or even a story arc. The brothers use satire and comedy to pass some highly controversial ""images"", avoiding, with the appearance of humor, the censorship all media and entertainment goes through today. Using the lack of intelligence, awareness and critical thinking of the perpetually offended, and of course some very skillful writing, the Coen brothers are able to present us with a brutal and savage portrayal of ""golden age"" Hollywood. Inspired in real events and persons, the filth, moral degradation and political decadence is all gloriously exposed. Particularly shocking and most worthy of compliment is the fearless assertion of the communists' use of film to introduce their political views in the entertainment of the unsuspecting masses. This is perhaps the first time I have seen such a claim in a Hollywood movie, at least told so boldly and explicitly. McCarthyism has long been vilified and the communists whitewashed by history and countless stories of injustices and broken lives produced, of course, by Hollywood. In hollywoodland no one was ever a communist and all were always falsely accused. In the movies, no communist in the ""business"" ever dreamed of using the power of the pictures to indoctrinate. Its obviously a myth. McCarthy had a base of truth and was needed in a time where a war of culture was being waged. Traitors undercover, scheming and sabotaging, could not have been allowed and had to perish. The absolute ridicule of the communists is staggering. Kidnappers! Ransoms! The Coen brothers are madmen! Also worthy of note is how Mannix and Hobie Doyle are the only two moral characters in the movie. Mannix is drowning in a sea of corruption and degeneracy, cleaning up the mess everyone else does, to keep the movie stars as a pure object of adoration for the audience. In the end he does it, not for the studio or for the stars themselves. He does it as a moral obligation, because its what's right. He's a family man, something the screenwriters of today loathe. He is also a devout catholic, another thing loathed by cultural Marxists. Hobie Doyle is a ""good old boy"", happy in his western movies. He's naive, eager to do the right thing as well. He's pure and basically happy to be alive. The Coen put him against one of Hollywood's directors, a suave, cultured man. The clash of the ""redneck"" and the intellectual is one the most amusing scenes and the Coen once again are savages. The director is arrogant, pretentious and superior. He complains that Hobie cannot act. He dismisses his good will and eagerness to learn. Later we find out he is an homosexual with a history of trading roles for sexual favors. Another Hollywood tradition. Another stab under the guise of humor. And so it is. One of the most brave movies in the last years. Its all there. And they never saw it coming. Bravo!http://individualwar.blogspot.pt/"
" A Pretty-Looking Dud
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,4,"The Coen brothers have done just about everything right for most of their careers. Their line of work is diverse, and fabulously off-beat. They find the humor and horror of both real and absurd situations. Hail, Caesar must be another hit, right? I sat through most of the film beside myself. It's a tribute to post-war, old-Hollywood, which is great and all.. but this was marketed as a comedy, and I never laughed. Where were the jokes? The irony? There is plenty of humor to be had at this bygone era, and the Coens didn't explore. The film relies heavily on perfectly constructed, whimsical set pieces and the pretty faces of it's all-star ensemble cast. Glitz and glamour only takes a film so far. If the story and characters are hollow, everything else will be. The critics adored this when it came out last year, which just goes to show you how much these old fossils love gushing over themselves and the industry they represent. This is not one of the Coen's finer hours. I guess if i didn't like this, I better never consider watching Rules Don't Apply? Yeah, sounds like a good idea to me."
" Reprinted from my blog (charlesmatthews.blogspot.com)
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,8,"With Hail, Caesar! Joel and Ethan Coen return to Old Hollywood, the scene of one of their earliest films, the dark horror-comedy Barton Fink (1991), this time to give us what appears to be a cotton-candy fantasia on movie genres. But Hail, Caesar! seems to me the more successful film. In its sly way it reveals the grip that Hollywood myth and history have on our imaginations, using parodies of Hollywood genre films not just to send up their absurdities but also to show how deeply they color our dreams. At the same time, it explores Hollywood history -- the hold the old studios had on actors' lives, the role of publicity and gossip in creating and destroying stars, the interaction with politics during the Red Scare of the late '40s and '50s -- and combines it with the parody sequences to create a movie that turns out to be a parody of movies about The Movies, a genre that includes everything from the many versions of A Star Is Born to Singin' in the Rain (Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, 1952) to, well, Barton Fink. The individual parodies -- the biblical epic, the drawing room drama based on a Broadway hit, the singing-cowboy Western, the Esther Williams extravaganza, the sailors-on-a-spree musical -- are all spot on. But it takes a special audacity -- something the Coens have never lacked -- to send up the anti-communist hysteria that led to the HUAC investigation and the blacklist. The Coens do it by treating the paranoid suspicion that left-wingers were undermining the American Way of Life by injecting Marxism into the movies as if it were real. So we have a communist cell made up of writers who kidnap a movie star for ransom, and another star who defects to the Soviets when the writers row him out to a submarine at night. It's a reductio ad absurdum of Cold War hysteria, as brilliantly handled by the Coens as it was by Stanley Kubrick in Dr. Strangelove (1964). The Coens also tease us by dropping the names of real people into the script. Josh Brolin plays a studio production chief and fixer named Eddie Mannix, which is the name of a real-life Hollywood fixer who kept wayward stars out of the headlines, and he reports to a studio executive in New York named Nick Schenck, the name of the president of Loew's, Inc., which owned MGM. One of the members of the communist cell in the film, a professor ""down from Stanford,"" is called Herbert Marcuse (John Bluthal), the name of a Marxist philosopher popular with the New Left of the 1960s. It's a film of wonderful cameos, including George Clooney as the kidnapped star, Scarlett Johansson as the Esther Williams equivalent, Ralph Fiennes as the director Laurence Laurentz, and Channing Tatum emulating Gene Kelly as the singing and dancing sailor. Tilda Swinton plays the film's competing gossip columnists, Thora and Thessaly Thacker, based on the notoriously powerful Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons. By making them twins, the Coens seem to have conflated them with the competing advice columnists Abigail Van Buren and Ann Landers, née Pauline and Esther Friedman."
" Hail, Rubish!
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,5,"Great visuals mean nothing if the acting is so wooden. The superb cast has been utilized for nothing but their names. The cowboy's lassoing was probably the only highlight of the whole movie. Channing Tatum danced quite alright but he was no Gene Kelly. It felt like a Wes Anderson movie but somehow this technique works in his movies alone. There is no discernible plot. What I could make out is that Clooney's character gets kidnapped by the communist section of the film industry and the demand for money was not really out of desperation as they have plenty of money. To Clooney some stupid explanation was given and the delusional Clooney accepts it and after being released repeats all that his captors have told him to Brolin, the Hollywood fixer who just slaps him to snap him out of it. I guess what everyone making this movie needed was a good slap like that to snap them out of this. Scarlett's character has a baby with a father who left and a single mum is going to result in a career-ending situation. Somehow Tatum was part of the communist film industry and the cowboy out of the blue seeing him with a briefcase which could mean anything really, decides to pursue him. The cowboy rescues Clooney while all his kidnappers were giving a send-off to their beloved communist hero Tatum who was headed to Moscow in a submarine. The dog was funnier than anyone there. It abruptly ends like it was just another day in showbiz not to be mistaken with the movie being short as it dragged on painfully. Not a horrible movie but not a good one either. All effort was directed at the set but none on the script and dialogue."
" Sooooo Commies Fly
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,3,"I don't get it. Pure and simple. There's a host of names and all are familiar faces their performances as taken from all their great films, and then nothing. The plot is hair thin. Giving no idea as to taking this even slightly serious or canning this as some artsy film that got the wrong attention and had to do better. I wonder as to the quality of the Coens,they have made such memorable films and are obviously tired of going the same path that leads to instant success. I see this as an example of extremely skilled Hollywood trying to do a spoof on itself and hitting some kind of internal censorship and then crippling itself from the first intent. The one thing that comes across as memorable are some lead-ins to a story that never get's any further explanation and the some lead-outs that never had a starting point. I like that ! Stories don't have to make sense. But the movie has got to obey it's own rules. The commy gay sailor can leap a long way and land securely, this is set up in a dancing scene and gets a payoff in the deflection to the submarine. Great ! But this is only happens once in the film and there isn't anything close to that again. The Cowboy lasso routine get's the same treatment without a rewarding payoff. Sorry Coen let's get into something more enticing next time."
" Hail, Caesar!
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,10,"Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) works for the fictitious studio hybrid Capitol Pictures, (that is the only fictitious angle about this film, however). Mannix is a fixer, the one responsible for repairing the issues of his acting stars, keeping the religious leaders happy with the morals of the films of his studio's, and securing the money stays in the right places for film production. Mannix leads a busy life, but he is sure to make time for his daily stop to his Catholic Church's confessional. Despite the Priest's urging that his practice is excessive, Mannix still shows up, desperate to make amends for his transgressions, also to work through his own issues with his faith. During a typical day of dealing with pregnant single movie stars, placating religious leaders, and casting dilemmas, Mannix is dealt an extreme blow that his biggest star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) has been kidnapped. Those responsible for the stars kidnapping, who refer to themselves as ""The Future"" promise the safe return of the studio's star in exchange for $100,000. Not only does Mannix have to scrounge up the funds to pay off the ransom, but he has to do it while keeping the situation out of the gossip columns running Hollywood public opinion. All of Mannix's problems may be solved, however, if he accepts a surprise offer in management at the Lockheed Corporation overseeing secret atomic bomb testing. Does Mannix really want to leave behind his chaotic role at the studio, or is such the profession exactly what he needs for the self-discovery he so seeks.The first and most obvious point to be made about the film is that it looks incredible. The use of color and the cinematography are works of art, leaping off the screen. It is no wonder the film was nominated for Best Production design, as the many large and elaborate sets were astonishing. Filming several movie sets is no small task. but the team behind Hail, Caesar! really pulled it off. Near the opening of the film, Brolin's character is discussing the depiction of Jesus in one of the studio's upcoming films with Priests, a Rabbi, and an Imam Khatib (maybe); this scene could come directly out of a joke, but it is complete perfection and timely in the film. It was a brilliant scene exposing, without a doubt, the faith-based journey the audience was about to take. What was an especially fun aspect of the film were the obvious caricatures of actors, directors, and producers from the studio era. As a fan of classic film, seeing such personalities as Ernst Lubitsch exaggerated on-screen was a true delight. There were also several notable supporting stars in the film it was a joy to see who would turn up next. Ever since I first saw Patrick Fischler in Mulholland Dr. I've wanted to see him in everything and was overjoyed that he briefly showed up in Hail, Caesar!. Typical of the Coen Brother's films, there was some brilliant camera angles to enjoy including wonderful low-angle, birds-eye-view shots and perfect shadow manipulation creating a beautiful film to look at. One of my favorite aspects of Hail, Caesar! was the frequency with which the audience gets to see the film from a perspective usually ignored. The camera is typically trained on the star of the film, but seeing the POV of an extra looking up at Baird Whitlock and all of his imperfections was a nice change. Whether it be a picture, a film, or anything else, I am always interested in what's going on in the background; what is it that is not being shown for a litany of reasons, and with Hail, Caesar! It is that background activity that gets such high regard, a refreshing angle for a film.My favorite aspect of a Coen brothers film is the subtext. Even if I am not always a fan of the duo's work, the fact that each of their films are riddled with subtext create, at least, an engaging film-watching experience. The takeaway from Hail, Caesar!, for me anyway is its subtext on faith and religion. It's clear that the character embodied by Josh Brolin is grappling with his faith throughout the film. He takes time out of his schedule daily to go to confession, he deals with the religious depiction in his studio's films seriously and even has a God-like job himself. Brolin's Mannix is responsible for removing problems and making sure everyone's life is as painless as possible all the while controlling the flow of money and output of his studio. People turn to him when experiencing problems, much like they turn to Christ to help cope. In the end, Mannix is offered a job to help protect the lives of the whole world, furthering his relation to an omnipresent being. Evaluating faith and religion in such a way was a serious strength to Hail, Caesar!. A deeper evaluation of faith and religion should be explored through cinema, as it is the medium with which art is nearly limitless. The Coen brothers, never to shy away from depth in their films, strike gold again with a thorough analysis of faith, and what it means to adhere to a religion. If you examine Hail, Caesar! on its own, rather than an entry in the filmography of the Coen brothers, a deeper appreciation may be able to be experienced for a wonderful film with a rich, much-needed subtext."
" A funny and clever satire about the film industry
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,9,"A great movie.Within this medium of feature films, almost every year we see many satires, parodies, that use references of other works or situations to build their, always around, jokes about such work.In this, we almost always see productions that may even be funny, but in 99% of cases they are just that, with no other ""layer"" behind everything, and ""Hail, Caesar!"" Is not one of those cases!The story of the film basically shows ""one day behind the scenes of a studio,"" with a parody of various elements of the film industry, from the life of a producer, decisions made within a studio, and how they can influence the future of production , And etc, always with an intelligent humor, that at the same time makes fun of the situation, showing them in an exaggerated way, also makes a criticism.Stuffed with great actors, the performances of the film dispense with comments, with impeccable direction at that point, and a script, which, as I said above, is intelligent and very well written.In summary: ""Hail, Caesar!"" It's a great movie. Smart and funny. And it portrays in the form of satire the backstage of the world of cinema, as well as exploring countless clichés (like communist villains) from the industry's own films ever since, in order to make jokes yes, but also in a way to say something to About it."
" Disjointed
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,4,"Was this a comedy? A drama? Who knows! I had a ""Free HBO"" weekend earlier this month, so I took advantage of it to watch Hail Caesar, a movie that sounded pretty good when I saw the trailer a few years ago. But I was younger and stupider then.Was it a comedy? If so, why wasn't it funny? ""Would that it twere so simple"" stopped being funny long before they finally stopped saying it.Was it a drama? If so, why didn't it keep me at the edge of my seat? The movie opens with George Clooney's character being kidnapped, and leaves us in suspense as to why. Well, not that much suspense, really. I stayed with this film for over an hour before I finally turned it off. I still don't know why he was kidnapped. And I don't care. And never will.Scarlett Johansson was solid as a hard-bitten 1930's type movie star. But George Clooney was just ... George Clooney in a toga. If he had walked into the studio cold and read his lines from cue cards, I don't think his performance would have been substantially different. Or perhaps we were supposed to believe that George Clooney in a toga is an inherently funny premise, and the mere sight of it would keep us in stitches throughout the movie? There were also a lot of pointless scenes. The swimming musical number at the beginning could easily have been cut out of the movie without losing anything. But then again, so could most of the other scenes in the movie. I understand from some previous reviewers that the swimming scene was intended to be a homage to the Esther Williams movies of the 1930's and 1940's. And indeed it was -- if ""homage"" is French for boring pointless imitation.Because I didn't watch the last half hour, I have to confess that the ending could well be a thrilling laugh-filled adventure that pulls the whole movie together and leaves the audience stunned with the brilliance of the film and its commentary on both Depression-era and contemporary Hollywood. Unfortunately, I'll never know. And don't intend to find out."
" Life At The Top.
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,7,"In its subdued way this is a hilarious movie.Brolin is the manager of a movie studio in the post-war years who must keep things rolling. He's a devout Catholic. His last confession was 27 minutes ago Brolin likes his current job despite the tension but he's been offered a higher-paying position. He hesitatingly asks the priest during confession about the conundrum. Should he keep his current job, which he feels is ""right"", or take the newly offered one? The priest thinks for a moment and replies, ""God always wants us to do what's right, my son. You see, God has given us this inner light --"" ""Yeah, yeah, I got it,"" says Brolin and bolts impatiently out of the confessional.The narrative has Brolin making a movie called ""Hail Caesar"" starring Clooney. But Cloony is drugged, kidnapped, and brainwashed by a handful of egghead communists, including one mastermind with an absurd foreign accent.It works. Clooney is released. He returns to the studio and explains dialectical materialism to Brolin in his office. Brolin fumes. When Clooney says something like, ""It's all a game by the vested interests to deprive us of our dignity,"" the scowling manager says, ""It is, huh?"", barely able to stifle his fury, and finally leaps around the desk and slaps Clooney out of it. The actor meekly obeys.I won't go on about the plot. It's filled with the Coens' usual irony. At the end, Clooney gives a truly transformative speech as the foot of the cross. The entire crew is enthralled by his passion. Then he forgets the last word of the speech and ruins the shot.It's scored by Carter Burwell whom I admire for his compositional talent and his sense of humor. Brolin's main conflict has been between religion and a coarser conformity. And under the end credits -- while the theater is emptying -- Burwell plays a beautiful rendition of a traditional Russian song, along the lines of ""Kalinka,"" performed by the superlative Red Army Chorus. When they're finished, we hear what sounds like a hymnal from Mitteleuropa. In between there are discreet peeps of a sonar apparatus, presumably looking for an ideological submarine, and when everything else is finished there is the cry of a distant siren."
" Peculiar, fragmented but likable
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,6,"A very typical Coen Brothers comedy, with humor very much in stile from Burn after Reading and O Brother where art thou. However, as this movies anchor is Eddie Mannix, the Capitol Pictures problem-solver, the story is a bit episodic and fragmented. It is hard to pick up the thread throughout the movie, partly due to that there is none. At the same time the story, the characters are quite likable and somewhat funny although there are few real laughs.At the same time this is a great homage/spoof of the 50's movies industry, having seen movies from that time sure helps. Both to understand all the thematic jokes and also to feel the nostalgia. A great many known actors also appear, in more or less (especially Dolph Lundgren) prominent roles. Feels a bit like the Coen Brothers and friends had a get together to reminisce about good old times. So even though this is likable, I found the somewhat similar Burn after Reading much better.6/10"
" Snoozefest

" Hail and Hearty
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,7,"George Clooney isn't an actor I rate particularly high, but, when he puts his mind to it, he really can act. His great performance in ""Good Night and Good Luck"" was one example. And here we have another.The movie is set in the 1950s when, of course, the US was in the grip of McCarthyism. Clooney plays Baird Whitlock, an empty headed star of epic films. He is kidnapped by radicals who demand a ransom of $100,000. Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is the studio heavy who has to sort this out, while handling pretty boy cowboy star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) who has been cast (OK, miscast) in a costume drama, fending off gossip columnists, considering a lucrative job offer, dealing with a pregnant starlet, and so on. On top of all that he's trying to quit smoking.I wonder whether it's easier for actors to play actors playing a part than it is to just play the part. The performances are, in fact, a real strength of this movie. Clooney is engagingly irritating and Brolin turns in a surprisingly sympathetic performance for such a heavy character. I also liked Tilda Swinton in a dual role as two sisters who are rival gossip columnists!The film captures the magic of 50s movies rather well. Scenes from the various movies being made as the story progresses are shown, including a rousing song & dance number called ""No Dames"" featuring Channing Tatum. When Whitlock is able to return to work, we get a scene that is set at the Crucifixion and gives Whitlock a chance to deliver a monologue that carries real power – until he forgets his lines!The music is excellent too. So, all in all, a pleasant, undemanding film experience.Rating: 7/10."
" The Coen Brothers hit a new low
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,1,"I won't bother with a plot summary for this film for the simple reason that it doesn't seem to have a plot. With that being said, let's crack on with the review.Before I start, I would like to say that I am neither a Coen brothers' fan boy nor am I a staunch hater of the brothers. In fact, I've found my attitude mixed towards the brothers when it comes to their films, but it's safe to say that this is easily the worst film of theirs that I have seen thus far...So what exactly is going on here? Are the Coen brothers poking fun at greedy film directors, producers and/or film makers? Are they also laughing at the fact that a big shot 'studio fixer' would go to pieces when a 'low-rent' alcoholic actor is kidnapped and held to ransom by a bunch of Communists? This sort of satire was covered in a similar vein (and just as badly) in Birdman 2 years ago and whilst I appreciate what the Coen brothers are trying to do here it can only be considered a monumental failure.I think the problem with this film is that the Coens try to cram too much into the film which results in the film having no real focus; you have Clooney's character being kidnapped, a sub-plot about Scarlett Johansson's character being pregnant, a bad actor Hobie Doyle getting more recognition than he deserves. This all leads to a rather messy screenplay and sadly, in this case, it's a film with several stories, but with none of the stories being remotely interesting.The best part of this film was actually the bit where all the sailors were singing and dancing, but to be fair even that section of the film was overdone and went on for too long.In my book, this film is a technical success - It's well-edited, and the acting is excellent by everyone involved - the Coen's really couldn't have assembled a better cast. It's a shame that their writing is so weak, the film is unbelievably boring and even their dialogue (which is usually pretty good) is rather sub-standard and ultimately it is these things that really ruin the film."
" Oy, Caesar...
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,6,"""Hail, Caesar!"" was one of the most anticipated movies of 2016 and one of the earliest releases. Being the last Coen brothers' movie made it an event by itself and probably one of the first expected Oscar contenders. Well, are you surprised that it only got a (lousy) Production Design nomination? I am not. Because... let's not kid ourselves; we all know the movie that marked the beginning of 2016 was ""Deadpool"". Sure it is less artsy and subtle than the more gourmet offering of the Coens but the film had the merit to feature a consistent plot, hilarious gags and without trying to be too smart, showcased a level of hip wit and self-deriding fun that ""Heal Seizure!"" failed to deliver. And I'm the first to deplore it.I know these two movies are as close one another as Meryl Streep to a Michael Bay's script, but they have one thing in common that justify the comparison, they're meant to be fun and they rely on parody. The parody is the key because it works on a material we're all familiar with but then distorts it in order to produce gags based on unpredictability. The trick is to not to rely too much on the spoofed material because not every audience would get the references or because the film serves the references, not the opposite. I'm more familiar with Hollywood history than comic-books heroes, yet I enjoyed ""Deadpool"" more than ""Give'em Hell, Caesar!"", I know it has everything a movie lover should love, it is a love letter to Hollywood, not without that ounce of wicked wit the Coen brothers made a specialty of. This is a film I wanted to embrace with my arms wide open, I love the brothers' movies and a film about Hollywood is the kind of offer I couldn't refuse. But this is 2016, we had ""Moulin Rouge!"", ""Chicago"" and ""The Artist"", then ""Argo"" and ""Birdman"", movies about old-school Hollywood have flourished like cactus in the desert. I even started to reconsider my love for these films because of the way they started a tiresome trend but again, this is a Coens' movie so it's always new even by the standards they create. I saw the film once, I had to see it twice, and then even a third time.Indeed, if it came from any other director, I would have thrown it already in the trashcan of my contempt but the Coens always get the benefit of the doubt. So how does ""Hell or High Caesar!"" hold up after the third viewing? Well, maybe better than at the first but that's not saying much. The premise is simply brilliant, having a Hollywood office worker whose specialty is to fix things (he's not called a fixer for nothing), and played by the always convincing Josh Brolin made me feel like I was going to penetrate an atmospheric neo-noir masterpiece like ""The Man Who Wasn't There"". Then the movie cuts to the titular film-within-the-film, a Tale of the Christ where George Clooney, playing a washed-up version of Robert Taylor in ""Quo Vadis"", is kidnapped.But by the time we get the identity of the kidnappers, and their political inclinations, the film features a collection of old-school Hollywood pastiches with an Esther-Williams actress played by Scarlett Johannsen in a Ziegfeld Follies act, a Western B-movie actor who's probably a reference to... some B-movie actor and a few other musical numbers. To get things straight, they're all well done, but they don't add anything to the plot except for just being well done, they drag on for so long I suspected they were used as time fillers. Some parts were hilarious though, I loved the scene with Fiennes as a Polish director or where Eddie Mannix talk with the religious representatives and they go into a debate about God. God, that was pure Coen brothers' genius.But despite the obvious effort to cover all the elements that made the history of Hollywood in the 50's, the Hayes codes, stars' depraved lifestyles, the Red Scare, ""Excelsior"" might be just a tad too sophisticated for its own good. It is probably an intelligent movie in its stylish complexity but it commits a rather silly move by predicting our instant praise on the simple basis that it's about movies. Well, the stunt seemed to have worked with critics as the film but it didn't show with the audience and many viewers dismissed it as the worst Coen brothers' film. Would I? Well, forgetting the premise and some hilarious parts, it is probably the worst in the sense that it simply used Hollywood as a vehicle for gags, but they never made you feel you that it was going somewhere, ""meh"" was my most frequently obtained reaction.I felt some strong Woody Allen vibes from it, from the stellar cast (also including Channing Tatum, Frances McDormand, Jonah Hill or Tilda Swinton as the two gossip columnists, twin sisters embodying the Hedda Hopper/ Louella Parsons rivalry) the film might have worked better had it played like Woody Allen's masterpiece ""Radio Days"". The film could have been a ""Hollywood Days"" with many little vignettes and that would have forced the Coens to push the concept a little higher, to make each one as enjoyable and entertaining as the whole of the film. Or maybe they should have just tried to forget about the whole homage thing because the film was never as funny as when it took departure from its Hollywood shtick.Now, to end on a positive note, if you love Hollywood and appreciate a good love letter with all the archetypes that forged Hollywood legend, just watch the magnificent five-minute dream sequence of ""The Ballad of the Daltons"". As for this film, well you might give Caesar what is Caesar's, but there's not much to give."
" An Average Coen Brothers Affair,
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,5,"Hail, Caesar is a mediocre movie with a mostly poorly developed plot, albeit a fantastic cast. The only thing that really holds it all together is the pure talent and charisma of the actors. Josh Brolin is suave in his performance, Clooney brings in laughs, playing yet another fool for the Coen brothers. Every cast member is complex enough in their performance that they exceed in both dramatic and comedic moments, which includes Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton and Channing Tatum.Its biggest weakness is its lack of a plot, it has one, very small story that does not consistently move forward, instead there is simply one sequence after another of films being made. Joel and Etan Coen clearly fell in love with the idea of recreating 1950s Hollywood that they forgot to tell a story that has a proper beginning, middle and end. It is also not very funny. I find the Coen brothers very hit and miss with comedy, I favour them using it subtly in their dramas. Full sequences that were clearly made with the objective of making us laugh did nothing for me, it became tiresome for me after a certain period of time as a result of how often the humour bombed. It is certainly a beautiful spectacle, even if there's not much more to it beyond that. Much more potential than it delivers, Hail Caesar is one you would be better off avoiding. A detective who specialises in Hollywood stars investigates the disappearance of a well known actor. Best Performance: Josh Brolin"
" Thinks it's more clever than it is
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,4,"As a paean to Hollywood, it hits all the stereotypical notes; in other words, it's not very original. While it seems obvious that the Coen brothers have an affection for this country's cinematic roots, Hail, Caesar! is as shallow as it is glossy in its representation of the studio era, the behind- the-scenes exploits of its actors and directors, and (therefore) the need for a ""fixer"" like Eddie Mannix, who was a real person that's played by Josh Brolin.The directors have included countless anecdotes to that time's well worn lore, but provide no unique insights or viewpoint. Because many of these references are obscure, they're likely of little value to a general audience; because they're too glib, they may even offend cinephiles. Overall, the film is rather mundane. That the movie's production design was nominated for an Academy Award is also surprising in that it appears to have been crafted to be on the same level of a Universal Studios tour attraction."
" You'd need to know something about cinematic history to completely get it BUT...
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,7,"... it really is a ""Tale of the Christ"" in allegory. Eddie Mannix is ""the fixer"" for a Hollywood movie studio, Capitol Pictures. His story is supposed to be in parallel with that of the Christ. This is not at all obvious. I had to watch it a couple of times - a couple of times in which I was actually trying to pick up all of the pieces of Hollywood history - to actually get it. Eddie is trying to quit smoking, and he is continually going to confession about his failures in this area. The devil is actually Lockheed, which offers Eddie a tempting offer to abandon his ""flock"" - the stars he looks after - in return for an easy job and financial security. He's got a family - wife and two kids - and television is on its way. What will he do? In the meantime Eddie's ""flock"", the stars of Capitol Pictures, are modelled after Hollywood history of the year in which this is set - 1951. Eddie is trying to deal with the unwed pregnancy of an Esther Williams clone, who curses, smokes (while pregnant), and is not at all sure who the father of her child is. Then there is the sudden disappearance of their biggest star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), without whom ""Hail Caesar"" cannot be completed. It makes fun of the singing cowboys, and what happens when you try to install one in a drawing room drama with a snooty directory, and even Carmen Miranda and Tilda Swinton as identical twins and competing gossip columnists - I am assuming she is supposed to be Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons - are lampooned.In this version of 1951, ""the Commies"" are real threats, not just boogeymen, and figure largely into the plot.If the Cohens made a mistake here it would be depending upon the audience knowing about old Hollywood and getting the allegory of Eddie Mannix as the Christ. You could watch and enjoy ""Fargo"" and know nothing about Minnesota, you could watch and enjoy ""Blood Simple"" and ""Raising Arizona"" and know nothing about the American southwest, but it might be tough going to watch this and get all of the jokes and plot points and know nothing of the history of Old Hollywood."
" Overdone and pointless
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,5,"""Hail, Caesar!"" is basically a series of over-produced sketches lampooning Hollywood genre films of yesteryear.Josh Brolin plays a character who is supposed to tie it all together, but he doesn't. His character, along with his relevance to the story, is pushed aside by musical and epic film scenes. These all feature a tongue in cheek and a wink at the audience, but you may feel that wink is probably aimed at someone else... who might also feel the same way.Simply put, the satire is toothless, because it doesn't have a relevant target in this day and age. How many film goers in the 2010s can even remember watching '50s musicals and historical epics?"
" Slow , uneven and not funny
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,3,"It has so much potential. Great cast, great sets, great premise. It is hard to know what went wrong. Lets start with the plot. Pretty weak. There were so many opportunities for action, drama or humour and there was just nothing. So it scores nothing Dialogue: I do hope that this was not ad-libbed. Because then I would have to say that the actors got it seriously wrong. Let's just assume it was a the corny dialogue that made most of the stars look like they were phoning it in using autocue. There was one scene with a minster, a bishop a rabbi and an orthodox priest. again a target rich environment for humour.. and it was just flat.If there was any clever word-play I missed it And that sums up the whole film. Great possibilities, under-par delivery. Disappointing"
" And this would be a comedy because...?
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,1,"The Coen Brothers have produced some moments of comedy gold over their careers. This film will not join their list of successes.Why? Because this film is poor. It lures you in with a glorious cast, who should be brilliant in this, and then it repeatedly disappoints. Scene after scene of I'm sure 'hilarious moments' on paper, that end up being naff.Channing Tatum and Scarlet Johansson aside this is a silly film, that doesn't know if it's trying to make a point about life/Hollywood or religion or not. In the end it does none of the above.I cannot recommend this film."
" Poorly Developed Plot and Characters
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,4,"Let's be honest, with a movie made by the Coen brothers comes expectations. This movie fails mightily in regards to those expectations. Don't get me wrong, the movie is beautifully shot and Brolin is solid as always in the lead. The problem with this movie is a horribly undeveloped plot and characters that are never developed or really significant at all to the story. You see this big name cast advertised, but for no reason whatsoever. Outside of Brolin and Clooney, practically no other characters are on screen for more than a couple of minutes, or are relevant to the story. Scarlett Johansson is completely irrelevant to the story, as is Channing Tatum. Jonah Hill phones in a bit part that had no point in even existing. The only supporting actor that really shines in their brief time on screen is Alden Ehrenreich, who is terrific. Sadly, he is introduced and then exits just as fast. This was a halfhearted effort by two very talented but bored filmmakers. They really did not have an idea for a complete movie, just a neat idea for a skit, a skit with no legs. I am a huge Coen fan, but this was pretentious and a waste of time.."
" Some good scenes and performances, but overall a misfire
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,3,"A film by the Coen Brothers is always worth checking out, but contrary to their reputation they can either achieve cinematic brilliance (Fargo, Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men) or excruciating lows (Intolerable Cruelty, The Big Lebowski, O Brother Where Art Thou), and a number of in-betweens. Hail, Caesar is definitely not one of their crowning achievements.The story is set in the heyday of the big Hollywood film studios and centers on studio ""fixer"" wheeler-dealer Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) detailing the various fires he must put out in order to keep production rolling on some the studios future hits. Aside from the usual, Mannix must contend with the ostensible kidnapping of the studio's most popular leading man (George Clooney) from the set of a Ben-Hur style biblical epic by a cabal of Communists and ward off the machinations of twin sister gossip columnists (Tilda Swinton) on the trail of big scandals.The film should be a lot of fun. Unfortunately, it missteps entirely too often and has huge dead spots. The obvious problems with the film hit the viewer pretty quickly. Eddie Mannix was actually a real figure, but the sanitized do-gooder that we see here bears no resemblance to the real thing. Brolin is an amazingly talented actor, but here he is forced to play everything straight as the film's purported anchor, which ends up making Eddie more than a bit of a drag in the central role. In fact, Brolin/Eddie is so stiff here as to be painful.Worse, the only time the film comes to glorious life and gives us an idea of what a success it could have been, is when it recreates in cheeky fashion some of the set pieces from yesteryear Hollywood. Alas, these moments are too few and far between, as the film gets bogged down in the tedious and criminally unfunny kidnapping plot, which takes up too much screen time and is never as amusing or subversive as the filmmakers believe. Every time we detour to Clooney and his kidnappers, you can almost hear the sigh of frustration from the audience.An amazing cast has been compiled for the film, but a number of them are wasted. Blink and you may well miss Frances McDormand as a daffy editor or Jonah Hill as a professional patsy. Scarlett Johansson gets a nice homage to Esther Williams spectacles and shines briefly as a tough-talking actress, but is underused. Ditto, Channing Tatum, who dazzles with a Gene Kelly-esque sailor dance routine before being utterly wasted. Clooney hams it up nicely, but he is saddled with the film's worst subplot which pretty much hogties his performance. If there is a standout, it is newcomer Alden Ehrenreich as a Gene Autry-type singing cowboy. Ehrenreich seems to be one of the few acting like he is in a comedy and is perfectly believable as the nice guy rube. Some of the film's few highlights are courtesy of him being forced to step in as a last minute replacement as lead in a British comedy of manners. His miscasting is hilarious and sets off director Ralph Fiennes into spasms of apoplexy.Alas, the misses far outnumber the hits. The tiresome kidnapping plot that dominates the screen time is ultimately pointless. Between the respectable recreations of old-style Hollywood splendor set pieces, most viewers will be checking their watch. The film is episodic and haphazard - it also needs a decent editor to remove what bits simply do not work. The whole thing culminates into a disappointing viewing experience."
" Another Bomb for the Coen Bros.
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"I'm glad this one was on HBO because if I paid for it at a theater I'd be really unhappy (and, once again, disappointed at a Coen Bros. film). I'm not saying that a film cannot have a variety of tones and multi-layered themes. But at the end of the day, it must know what it wants to be overall: a comedy, a message movie, a thriller, a historical film, etc.Hail, Caesar is crammed full of A-list actors stuck in a failed concept of a movie. I can't say that the Coen Brothers are afraid to go for it, whatever ""it"" is. Sometimes their off-beat approach strikes gold as in Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, Fargo or O' Brother Where Art Thou. Then again, they have more than their fair share of black comedy (?) bombs such as Intolerable Cruelty, Burn After Reading and The Lady Killers. Well, sorry to say, add this Hail, Caesar to the bomb list and hope their next project is another gem like No Country for Good Men or True Grit."
