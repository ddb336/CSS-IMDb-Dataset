" Third class remake as always
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,1,If you are thinking to watch this movie simply watch original movie warriors.Akshay ruined another masterpiece movie by his spoilt remake.
" It nails the heart, but
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,6,"It nails the heart, but everything else about 'Brothers' is yawnful.The film manages to make you care for Akshay Kumar's character David, as well as for Sidharth Malhotra's Monty but it's skewed heavily towards Kumar. Away from them though, it's poorly crafted storytelling in regards to the sporting and siblings/father parts of the plot.It also goes on for too long, my version of the film - via Colors Cineplex - only ran for around two hours... I'm not sure where the apparent extra thirty or so minutes went, though I'm kinda glad as that extra portion would probably put my rating much lower. At least the music is nice.There are many better Hindi sport dramas out there."
" Another Hollywood copy
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,1,This is movie is just a lame copy of Tom Hardy's Warrior 2011. Director karan Malhotra just copied same as in the warriors..
" Must watch
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,10,I was crying during the whole movie...especially at last scene
" Just Like The Rest
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,5,The First One Hour Promises us the viewer more then the regular bollywood action film but right after the half hour mark Brothers Turns into any other bollywood FLICK. C+
" Good
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,6,It is a good take on Warrior and story line is powerful. The movie could have been great but due to bad editing in first half it slows and drags....second half fights are well done. It should have been trimmed by good 20 min in first half.
" Short review
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,6,"Too much drama for a sports film. The punchy adrenaline rush that you expect from this genre is missing in this film. The cast has done wonders in making me feel good about this movie. The backstory is a plus, without the backstory i dont think this movie has anything good. There was one fight scene that delivered the right emotions,the rest were put together to stretch the movie. And that too is another negative, this film could have easily been trimmed, since the cast is capable they didn't have to extend the scenes to deliver the emotions.
The direction and screenplay was awesome. The fight scenes were well choreographed except for some parts but its required for the Bollywood touch.
The cast is superb.
The story is wonderful, especially the backstory which fitted right in the movie.
I see that they have taken inspiration from many movies in this genre.
Overall an above average movie"
" ! and then right at the flipping end David tells Monty to stop?!
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,5,"I really wanted to hate this because I don't usually watch Indian movies, but surprisingly I really enjoyed it.
The fighting scenes were great! The story line wasn't typical at all.
But Bollywood just have to EFF the whole thing up don't they!!
*SPOILER ALERTS*
NOTHING was Monty's (younger brother) fault yet he had to pay for it all.
EVERYTHING was the fathers fault. THEN EVERYTHING was David's (older brother) fault. He treated Monty like dirt for something that was out of his control.
BUT throughout the movie we are meant to feel sorry for David because his daughter's ill?!! SOD THAT!! He didn't give a rats backside for his younger brother at all for YEARS and then at the end he is redeemed and wins the 90 million!?! and all is forgiven?! I'm sorry but I was waiting for him to get a thrashing of his life and ending up in hospital totally isolated and disgraced!
OMG I can go on and on about this ending but I may just smash something and write obscenities everywhere!
TYPICAL BOLLYWOOD ENDING."
" Brothers, is indeed a very good movie.
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,10,"I totally liked this movie. Loved it . Brothers, is indeed a very good movie."
" Fantastic performances and Brilliant Direction
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,8,I do not understand what the critics want Bollywood to do. If they make Entertaining Romantic comedies ; they rate them low. They write that Bollywood does not grow from Song and Dance sequences.Brothers is surprisingly a very good effort by Karan Malhotra The casting of actors is impeccable. The boys cast as Akshay Kumars and Siddharth Malhotra's childhood really look like them.Jackie Shroff gives a breath-taking performance and you are left to think that such great actors are left with no work because the audience and critics do not appreciate a good performance. Akshay Kumar steals your heart. He has grown tremendously as an actor. Siddharth Malhotra is decent and he can improve Overall a great film
