" Great story
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,9,Kevin Costner was great as the grandfather fighting for custody of his granddaughter. The supporting actors were well cast and the story was intriguing with the different cultures fighting for custody of this little girl. Loved it.
" Beautiful movie
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,9,Definitely pushes the limits of politicly correct. And worth every minute of viewing.
" A great movie which gracefully handles race
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,9,Being in a similar situation we saw this movie which hit so many marks. The love surrounding the little girl of mixed heritage was not something wither family dwelled on. I could also relate to the grandmother (Octavia spencer) hoping a renewed relationship between father and daughter will help him take responsibility. Deeply moving with a heartfelt story.!
" Well worth watching
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,10,This movie deals with what in this century is still an issue and it is dealt with very sensitively. Everyone in it did a superb job. Kudos all around.
" Touching
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,10,Kids are caught in the middle of circumstances such as this. Even in today's society- the story always needs to be told. Wonderful movie. Thank all of the cast for this loving movie
" Touching story :-)
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,7,"Great acting, touching moments, and lots of tense moments :-("
" Very good
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,8,"Excellent, real life type situations, dialogs, but lots of missed opportunities. Maybe it was too true to real life? Because in the end, Wee-Wee and the family have a new appreciation for Grandpa, but Grandpa seems not to have grown at all. This kind of makes him come off as ""right all along"" despite his self righteous hypocrisy, rather than growing and embracing the other part of the family. You can feel the continued mistrust and it makes such an important character unlikable and probably untrue to his speeches, which makes the story unsatisfying. A kind word to Reggie wouldn't have hurt any either. Again, maybe this is how the actual story went in real life. I wouldn't be surprised if it is. But it kind of made the movie unsatisfying. Other than that peeve, there was plenty to like about the movie."
" Absolute drivel
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,3,"Unrealistic to the max, no chemistry between actors, bad writing, the characters do things that make no sense. The movie literally goes no where and pretty much ends up where it was when it was at the 5min mark. I have a mixed family and you think we would be able to relate something. Nope just lazy writing and stereotypical tropes. Also gotta say I have always loved Costner and maybe he couldn't overcome the mediocrity in this one but man his acting was like he just showed up to clock in and cash a check. I finished it thinking well dang I wanna at least find out what happens. Not a damn thing. I won't ever get those two hours back of my life."
" Well Done Film About Serious Subjects
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,7,"This film is hard to rate as it was well acted and written and dealt with many very serious issues in a fair manner. However, it is a serious film, not an entertainment and there are not any real likable characters. Basically, it shows life as it is unfortunately and this leaves one with a sense of anger and disappointment. Again, it is well done, but definitely not uplifting"
" Great storyline
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,I am a fan of both Kevin C. and Octavia S. This movie's storyline is very moving. No need to mention leads and supporting leads' great acting. I couldn't believe that I missed this movie in 2014. By luck I watched it in Roku.
" Questions
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Apparently the Grandma (Octavia Spencer) has ""six businesses"" and is doing well financially, so why are they living in a rough area? Why is she taking care of so many kids/grandkids? Where are all her adult children and why aren't they looking after their own kids? Why are they all sitting around singing kumbaya and cradling babies, as if no one has a job? Why were none of these questions raised in court? Will Eloise grow up to be like her Grandma's other children - unemployed, doing nothing, sitting on the porch cradling a baby?This is my biggest problem with the movie. The stereotypes. The black family didn't have much of an argument except for ""she needs to be with her own people"".The story would have been far more interesting if it depicted two families, black and white - one family full of high-earners, lawyers, doctors, etc, and the other family full of hard-workers but in lesser roles. Both are working class, but one can afford to live in a nicer neighbourhood and enjoy the finer things of life. While the other family lives a more simple life, but they are by no means lazy.This presents the question: does earning more money and going to a better school mean your children are ""better off""? Are courts bias against families that earn less and have fewer ambitious, secular-minded goals?If I switch my brain off and just go with it, it's a good movie. But I just feel that there was Oscar potential here if the Director explored this deeper and not just on a surface level."
" Dull grey
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,6,Had some potential but instead of riding waves of emotion I found myself floating on gentle ripples. It just didn't rise to any heights and the characters were mono dimensional. Was it an attempt at a commentary on racial issues or family? Neither were dealt with well and it just meandered along to a lifeless ending.
" Oil and water
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,3,"If the intentions with Black or White were good - it's hard to tell - they are paving the way to hell.The attempt at meshing up a bundle of stereotypes, giving it a good shake works as well as it would with oil and water.Taking on; age, class, gender AND skin colour may have been a stretch too far. Whatever the reasons, the end result is pure disaster. If anything is achieved - it is the reinforcement of the stereotype.Adding insult to injury; Costner has absolutely no chemistry with Jillian Estell or Octavia Spencer rendering a sense of awkwardness throughout the film.Steer clear good people - Black or White is an embarrassing attempt at filmmaking."
" Worth Watching!
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,7,"Such a good movie!! I almost didn't watch it because I was worried it would be boring or sad. But something inside of me told me to give it a try anyway and I'm really glad I did. It had great acting, the little girl was adorable, and the judge literally stole the show. Who the heck is that lady?!? Overall, it boasts a very good storyline which explores the themes of prejudice and hypocrisy, not just in the racial sense, but in other ways as well. Well worth watching."
" a new take on race relations
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it shows you how important it is not be racist and that addiction doesn't matter on age or colour of skin. The direction and screenplay are both excellent. The casting and acting are both excellent also. Especially by Kevin Costner and Octavia Spencer as competing grand parents. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" LOEZE
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,6,"The film centers around a court battle for custody between a rich white alcoholic grandfather and a black crack-head father. Kevin Kostner play a poorly scripted drunk who loves his granddaughter Eloise (Jillian Estell) and wants the best for her. When his wife dies, he must care for her himself.For some reason they decide to give us the background information late. His daughter was the mother who died in child birth while dad did time in prison. Octavia Spencer plays the paternal grandmother who feels she is also entitled to custody having a large family on the South Side.
The film is humorous, heartwarming, and gritty as it takes a more realistic view on race and the race card which climaxes near the end as Costner takes the stand.Guide: 1 MF bomb. N-word. No sex or nudity."
" Costner and Spencer Anchor Touching Family Drama
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,7,"Major Spoilers ""Black or White"" is a drama co-produced and starring Kevin Costner, written and directed by Mike Binder.The plot is, and ""is not"" about race. It's about the ties of family, forgiveness, and stepping up to responsibility-- but race also is in the midst of each of those issues, complicating each for the characters.I don't know that anyone's social views will be all that changed by the events of the film. If anything, they might be affirmed.Oscar winner Octavia Spencer does solid work with Rowena-- the paternal grandmother of the child at the center of the film-- who is more nuanced than the film's trailer might suggest. Nonetheless, the film gives her character plenty of the ""tough & sassy eye-rolling mama"" tropes to wade through.Rowena's attorney brother Jeremiah (Anthony Mackie) is set up as a kind of Johnnie Cochran stand-in, with racial-bait ideology at the forefront of his mind.The granddaughter Eloise is written as very precocious for her age; surprisingly, any ""deeper insight"" as to her feelings about her father suddenly coming back to her life are not revealed. I was halfway expecting a segment where she is allowed to speak in court but, it doesn't happen. Curiously, Rowena's gay daughter and family are introduced in a matter-of-fact way (perhaps an oblique commentary that Rowena is not homophobic), but the daughter's take on these issues aren't dealt with at all; she just kind of stays in the background. (I'd have to see the film again to even be sure which one was the daughter, and which was the partner. They're THAT much in the background.) Elliot can apparently go on as many benders as he wants, but the drinking is just seen as ""a little problem"", that Elliot is ""addicted to anger"" and not ""full blown"" alcoholism. It seems to sidestep taking the issue seriously.Duvan, an African immigrant of nondescript nationality (except that his hometown was war-torn) serves as an ""alternative black"" in Elliot's life. He's given a kind of ""model minority"" backstory in his college-student status, prolific paper-writing and multiple-language fluency. He's quite visibly nervous in his first visit (albeit an impromptu one) with the Jeffers family. The family treats him with respect, though no one seems curious at all as to where he's originally from. In another kind of film, someone in Rowena's family might have made fun of his accent on his first visit. But the glaring uncuriosity concerning Duvan came across as a little disingenuous. Also, it seems like the filmmaker was veering toward a scene where Elliot comments in a moment of drunkenness to Duvan, ""You're the type of black guy I wouldn't have minded my daughter dating"". Perhaps fortunately, it doesn't happen.We see nothing of Elliot's blood relatives or any in-laws via his wife's family. Seemingly nobody of note at the funeral/wake, just, nothing. Do any of them know or care about Elliot/Eloise? Maybe this would have complicated the balance of characters, but anyway..The film resolves itself in a somewhat surprising way. The narrative is flawed, but well-meaning. It is tolerable for a second watching."
