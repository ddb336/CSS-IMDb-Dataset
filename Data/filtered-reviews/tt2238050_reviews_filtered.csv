" thriller??
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,2,"Slow and it focus on the wrong things. So many scenes did not add to the story, and those that did were not shown but narrated. The college part was unnecassary for example. It was a thriller like the last quarter perhaps. Should be described as a girl who tries to handle her mothers sudden disappearance but she does not really do that either."
" Woodley packs a Wallop
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,7,"Araki chooses good actors like Woodley and Green. The music moves Woodley to dance. Woodley is this film. The white bird is the mother who is gone. Books can develop poetic images, but films have to show them. Some snow scenes could have been cut. The missing mom is loved by her daughter and husband, and that is the gravitas that cooks the script. Because deep emotions are felt, this script packs plenty of punches."
" Aweful writing and dialogue
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,1,"I guess this movie is a collection of the director's own personal twisted fantasies. Being able to direct a movie doesn't mean you should write it. ""My virginity disappeared just like my mother"". WHAT? ""I know why you here, you here to seduce me right?"" ""Yes"". What is this. Is Gregg Araki 12 years old? Too bad because he had some good actors to work with. Unfortunately the best ingredients won't make a great meal if the cook sucks."
" It's Okay..
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,4,"Not bad but not great, right in between. Unnecessary nudity and sex."
" I did not enjoy this movie.
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,5,I feel like I'm missing something. How does this movie have over a 6 on here?I could not connect with the characters or plot very much. I may have enjoyed the teen angst main character/coming of age piece better if I understood her relationship with her parents a bit better.I found Eva Green's character so confusing. It's supposed to be the 80s but she seems like a 50s or 60s housewife. Her drawl is strange to me. I could not see past that.The movie seemed to rely on showcasing Shailene Woodley's body at times.I would not watch this again.
" White Bird in a Blizzard
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Admirers of Araki's previous work will find both familiar territory and a great deal to appreciate in his most recent full length effort. Once again based on a source text, Araki demonstrates an ability to make an oddly enjoyable, if flawed, novel into an oddly enjoyable, if flawed, film. As is his way, Araki creates a lush and visually captivating world for his characters to exist within, but there's a lot more here than just pretty people doing odd things. A coming of age fable, in a way, Araki is adept at focusing this time on two female protagonists, a mother and daughter, who ended up mirroring one another in unexpected ways. While the resolution of the film may feel reductive to some, it's also classic Araki in its refusal to subscribe to heteronormative tropes and insistence on exploring the less palatable aspects of human nature. Upon a second viewing, Blizzard again reminds me of the following lines: ""Drowning dry along the high wire or buried deep among the frozen trees, we are still seeking one another, we are bleeding, birthing, skirting, seeking one another. We are seeking each other, no matter how long we keep breathing."" A worthy watch. Recommended."
" Awkward coincidence
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,9,"So, by utterly awkward coincidence I sat through two movies this morning with some very random but intense similarity in the plot. First movie was Spider (2002, directed by David Cronenberg) and the second was White Bird in a Blizzard (2014, directed by Gregg Araki). The first may actually have intensified the horror of watching the second narrow down to its plot. Where in Spider the aspect of what really went down in the main character's past is left to interpretation, in White Bird the story narrows down to a single truth. In both movies we follow a main character that is slowly picking up clues about a mysterious past. A recommended pairing of two seemingly unacquainted movies!"
" Better than expected
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,7,I watched this movie because my wife wanted to so I didn't have any real expectations for it. It's about a dysfunctional family where the mother is increasingly unhappy and bitter. One day the mom is just gone and the dad and daughter have to pick up the pieces. It turns into a movie about finding out what happened to the mom but for much of it it's just about how the daughter copes and her life after her mom. The acting is pretty good and while it is slow it kept me interested the vast majority of it. Decent flick.
" finally
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,7,"I had commented on a series were all the reviewers were going on about araki. I was not familiar with any of his work. I must say I like hi style. A bit like Lynch but arakis film had more tone of a story than lynch's which can just come off way too cartoonish. This was a bit so but imo not over the top. Eva acted much like Isaella Rosillini in Blue Velvet which she was my favorite character in. This had me cracking up. Especially when she comes down stairs "" how do I look, pretty good for 41"". Lol. I enjoyed her character and thought the daughters reactions were real. And yes people some mothers are like this even worse. I liked all of the characters ( weakest was maloni) . I'm going to have t look up some of his other movies. I did see about 30 minutes of "" Nowhere"" which had a great cast but I didn't like the style of that. I'd recommend if you like kind of odd, surreal films mixed in with a good mystery type film."
" Very dramatic thriller
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,8,"Although there is not much tension during most of the first 80% of this movie, I would classify it as a thriller. The end is very interesting and stays surprising even to those, who saw some of it coming.
Despite the first big portion of the movie being a family drama, it is far from boring neither. There is something for everyone: the frustrated house wife, who had expected so much more from life. The coming-of-age teenager discovering lustfully her sexuality. And the somehow disconnected father, who seems to make it all work, but spends far too much time at work.
Definitely not a boring a flick and looking at all the reviews a good proof that taste is very subjective and depends on your whole life situation. I do not think that I would have enjoyed this movie when I was a 22-year old single University student, but having my own family now makes the story more relatable."
" Save Your Movie Watching Time - 3 Or 4 Stars Is Being Kind
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,4,"02/02/2019 ""White Bird in a Blizzard"" - Catchy title - little substance -waste of precious movie watching time. Wanna see the whole movie in 15 or less minute? The watch the first 5 minutes and the last 10 minutes - you've just seen the entire movie with the exception of an hour+ worth of movie filler. It SUCKS! No coming of age storyline. No hidden message, just aLL filler. The movie title should have been - ""Dark Turd and a Buzzard"" Bon Appetit"
" NOT THE BRIGHTEST CRAYON IN THE BOX
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,10,"Based on a novel by the same name. One day Eve Connor (Eva Green) disappears. The story centers on her daughter Kat (Shailene Woodley) who is unaffected by her disappearance. The father (Christopher Meloni) is upset.The tale takes place during those obscure years between the 80's and 90's when the Depeche Mode empire crumbles and Grunge hasn't taken hold. We get insights into Kat's mind as she has flashbacks when she talks to a psychologist (Angela Bassett). She also has two confidants: an obese girl (Gabourey Sidibe) and a gay teen (Mark Indelicato). More insight is provided by her dreams where her mother appears. Kat, we discover loves sex...not exactly the words she uses.The title of the feature, like Kat's dreams are oozing with symbolism and metaphors, some of which I missed. There is a picture of a blizzard scene in the living room which the camera lands on for a few seconds. I decline to mention my views of the symbolism as it would be a plot spoiler. There is a twist that does have soft clues which I overlooked. Kudos to you if you figure it out.The film was well acted and a must for those who love quirky indie dramas laced with humor.Parental Guidance: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Shailene Woodley and NOT Eva Green...perhaps the biggest shocker of the film.)"
" Holds your attention... Takes you nowhere!
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,5,"This movie was more about a teenager's obsessing with her breasts and sex ,then about her missing mother! Her mother's missing and given their history she assumed mom left dad, meanwhile all she can think about is sex with the detective that's on the case of her missing mother, and screwing her boyfriend who no longer desires her , which we find out why later on in the movie. For the movie to supposedly be about a woman gone missing it sure did not focus on it. It focused more on the girl coming of age and her desires, if that's the case it should have been titled A Coming of Age ,college years later she's literally sitting around her friends before she actually gets the idea that maybe, just maybe her mom didn't run away after all, maybe something did happen to her? Maybe dad is responsible? Just for her friends to tell her hey, we've been telling you that for years now! Really Columbo?"
" An interesting film.
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,7,"I don't believe this is your typical coming of age film, but in essence, it is one. Just narrowed to a very specific setting and situation. A 17 year-old Kat Connors is forced to carry on her final teenage years without her mother present; not that her mother was very attached to her or anything, but she disappeared in mysterious circumstances and there are no answers regarding her whereabouts. On top of all, Kat (Shailene Woodley) is in the midst of her sexual awakening and self discovery, which can be very confusing at such age. She keeps having dreams in where she sees her mother dressed in white. She reaches a point where she doesn't believe her mother (played by Eva Green) will come back. Eventually she starts to notice that something is off, and that some things are being kept from her. She confronts her boyfriend about it and the truth will be really hard for her to handle.I really enjoyed this movie, the pacing and the overall development of the plot felt nice and right. The acting is great, Shailene Woodley, Eva Green, Christopher Meloni (as Kat's father) and Thomas Jane (as the detective investigating Kat's mother's dissapearance, and her sexual interest) all provide respectable performances, as is usual with them. Director/writer Gregg Araki did a correct job, I appreciated the tone of the film, and I thought the colours were used very well. To me, it felt that it had some sort of impact.Really interesting film, towards the end it gets truly absorbing, when everyone come to terms with the truth.
Don't miss out on this one."
" A bit boggy at times
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,4,"I like the premise of this story, I like the subtle back story telling, I didn't like the depiction of Cat's casual promiscuity and the nudity was a bit gratuitous. The so-called plot twist at the end is not in keeping with the story. To start, the wife is obviously unsatisfied with their sex life, but since she is an emasculating bitch, it's not surprising her husband is unable to rectify that situation. He does exhibit upset when she dallies with a neighbor and has enough mojo to jerk off to a Hustler magazine. Cat and her boyfriend are very interested in each other and the sudden ghosting goes along with the wife's overt behaviour towards the boyfriend. The twist comes when we see the husband and the boyfriend in bed and that's when the husband kills the wife? Again, there is virtually nothing that points in that direction, it would be more sensible keep with the story line already presented. I think the insertion of homosexuality is just bizarre and spoils the movie. The Mrs. Robinson aspect makes more sense and is more true to life."
" Slowly unfolding story
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,7,"Main characters were all more or less disturbing, the only one I praised was the detective. Eva Green was creepy and she did overall a decent job with her role. Soundtrack was good and psychedelic, matching the story. Not a watch-again movie but not bad either."
" Great plot full of twists and turns
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,8,"I really liked this movie. I like these sort of plots where you keep going backwards and forwards so you can find out a little more about what's going on. You spend the whole movie thinking that the mother is simply gone and maybe having an affair with someone. Finally when you finally get an idea of what could've happened to Eve (the mother) becuse it all makes you think that Kat's dad killed her and hid the body into a freezer, Kat opens it and she finds nothing but frozen food, and your idea of her mother's body being in there fades away, but at the end of the movie they reveal that, as you provably expected, that her dad killed Eve because she was seeing Kat's ex boyfriend Phil, but at the very last moment we find out Kat's dad was actually having an affair with Phil. It might be fiction but I believe it reflects what happens when your marriage doesn't work and you are not happy with your life, obviously I don't mean that all of this could happen but it shows how blown up someone's mind can be when you have internal problems.My conclusion is that nothing is what you expect, I really think I made a good choice by picking this movie!"
" Predictable, gloomy, and boring.
",2017-12-09 00:00:00,3,"Kat's mother up and disappears. Kat immediately starts sleeping with the detective on the case. There are flashbacks where we see Kat's mother treating her like a pet ""cat"" and being a cold hearted bitch to her father. Kat has dreams of walking through a snowstorm and her mother calling her name. Kat's boyfriend acts suspiciously when Kat comes home from college. There is a flashback scene when the freezer in the basement becomes unplugged by accident and stinks up the house. As soon as this scene occurs, the ending is obvious. The snowstorm represents the inside of the freezer, where Kat's mother's body is. Her dad killed her mother and hid the body in the freezer. Except we have no sympathy for Kat, who tells her therapist that she doesn't miss her mother at all, and just wants to sleep with guys. Nor any for her mother, who right from the start, like stated earlier, is just a cold hearted bitch. And of course, there has to be a homosexual element to the story, as every single movie and TV show has these days. Skip this movie. It's a waste of 90 minutes."
" Quite an enjoyable watch
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,6,"The film's intentionally awkward and disjointed style takes quite a while to settle into, as the clumsy dialogue and impenetrable story juxtapose with beautiful images and music. But once you get your head round everything, it is quite an enjoyable watch, the main attraction here being the impressive cast - particularly Shailene Woodley's sensitive character, Eva Green's wonderfully cartoonish performance and the breath of fresh air from the comical Gabourey Sidibe and Mark Indelicato.Overall, I would recommend the film; but if you miss it, I wouldn't fret too much."
" A strangely indifferent story.
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,3,"This film is so nonchalant in its storytelling you feel as if the whole thing has been told to you by someone who's been awake for 24 hours and is just about to pass out. Shailene Woodley gives a strong performance but plays an unlikeable self indulgent bore. I couldn't care less about her story and her discoveries because there was nothing to root for. No real sense that the character is a worthwhile one to watch change. The signature seduction scene is cringeworthy and very unsettling, like seeing someone rip a band aid off as slowly as possible. Although for anyone interested, she does indeed have a lovely pair of breasts. At a brisk 91 minutes, we have little time to spend with these characters and the time we do spend with them we neither enjoy or get much in the way of insight or thought. Eva Green was potentially interesting but unexplored, nothing but a mystery. Do we care about this weird, cruel mid life crisis having woman? i did not. She Probably shouldn't have gotten married seeing as it conflicted with her wild child personality. Chirstopher Meloni sits around a lot wearing a moustache but again is one dimensional. Shiloh Fernandez is pretty good at playing a complete dope but again has little else to latch onto. Overall it's just a tepid, boring drama. The colourful cinematography and cool soundtrack is great but there's just so little substance it equals naught."
" A good but somehow ordinary mystery
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,8,"Kat, an ordinary girl living with her parents, receives an unexpected blow when her mother suddenly disappears. She was acting somehow strangely in the last couple of days but nobody had seen that coming. They continue to live their lives without her, but for Kat, it all seems a bit too unexpected. Although struggling to keep her life together, regularly seeing a psychiatrist, she keeps having some strange dreams about her mother which don't seem to leave her at peace. Sooner or later, she's bound to find out the truth but it's going to be some really shocking news.It's a life story which does a great job in maintaining a mystery throughout its entirety. It mostly focuses on different things just to suddenly remember the main controversy over and over again. It is unpredictable and has a shocking finale (at least for me it was) but it isn't special in any other way. It depicts ordinary and dull things which sometimes induce a state of boredom, thus leading to less pleasant feeling. Besides that, it's a good mystery movie which keeps your subconscious puzzled while delivering big punch with its finale."
" Bizarre teen drama
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,5,"White Snow in a Blizzard is a book adaptation film, in which is a lower level not as popular book release. The film is quite a serious drama with some set tones of comic relief and bit of a thriller. The film is quite interesting and bizarre and plays out of a different type of film in comparison to typical Hollywood films. The problems with this film is that it isn't as suspenseful or thrilling as it could have been, and the characters (specficially Shailene Woodley's character) is quite unlikable in this lead, but that was most of the point.Trying to shed off and try a different role compared to her other 'good girl' roles, Shailene Woodley does do a successful job as we see her disrobe in several scenes and use more cursing. Another thing with this film is they added far too many F-bombs, in which we start to notice. We understand teenagers do curse heavy but with this film it became a bit annoying and obvious, perhaps not great writing.Also the main point of the film if the disappearance with the mother, but most of the characters don't tend to care or at least show, or do a better job at trying to find her. Especially Woodley and the father (Christopger Meloni) where as if they don't care about the mother's disappearance why should we. This film has been compared to Gone Girl, but in comparison, Gone Girl had much better writing, was more suspenseful, worked better as a thriller, and we cared what happens in the ending. White Snow in a Blizzard's ending felt a little rushed, as the film is quite slow in pace, then within the last 5 minutes or so, everything is wrapped up, and there a few plot twists that come alone surprisingly. Though they work, perhaps about 10 minutes more they could have added to layer out the rushed ending. This film isn't for everyone and it is a relatively smaller film, but those who like Shailene Woodley and her disrobing may enjoy it."
" Just finished it and thinking about it it has more depth than I first thought
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,6,"Never read the book but to me it had the depth of a decently written book capturing the time of being so into yourself at 17 and slowly waking up to reality in college to lives outside of yourself and the complexity of human beings.I guess the only two hints that the father was gay was that when she went to work with him all the women loved him, ""he had game"" and just ignored it and of course the obvious, he never has sex with his wife. What through me off was the dad masturbating to a Hustler Mag with women on the cover but maybe he turned gay later or was bi-sexual? I would of liked a lot more of the mother in it. That scene where she is just staring at her daughter in the her doorway in that dark makeup zoned out of her mind and her daughter just gently slams the door in her face and she doesn't even flinch made me laugh. This show needed more dark comedy. Also in the ending I also was wondering if it was like the book because there is some lazy writing.The dad puts his wife in the basement freezer and you know this right away because earlier in the movie they open it up and it was unplugged and stunk of raw meat so towards the end you know when that scene comes she is in there. So I expected her that night to wake up or something and see him driving off in a car or carrying her body out in something since it was her last night before leaving there. But no, after all those years he gets drunk at a bar two weeks after his daughter leaves and tells a guy at a bar what he did, really? You couldn't come up with something better than that? The part before was good with them being caught in bed but the ending sucked.The score and music is great for that time frame especially for those who were around the main characters age during that time and came from broken homes as the music fits.Overall I enjoyed it but wouldn't really recommend this movie."
" An odd mix of sadness, teen humor, and dysfunctional family
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,4,"I rented this to see Eva Greene. She was there, but she played a distraught, emotionally damaged woman so it was not the treat I had hoped for.This movie is about a girl who has a mother that is obviously NOT in love with her husband. The poor daughter is an innocent victim in this situation. Something appears to have snapped in the mother such that she is totally unhappy with her humble existence as a homemaker. She was close to the daughter when she was little but somehow that has cooled now that the girl in in her late teens.She grows increasing negative and one day just disappears. This leaves a hole in the daughter that she learns to deal with but the hole is always there, never quite healed.It is a bit depressing to see a family be so deprived of loving relationships.There is some mystery but the movie has no really stellar moments. The acting was okay, never felt like any were ""acting"", but again nothing stood out as being really amazing."
" Unusual but good mystery drama
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,7,White Girl in a Blizzard follows a girl trying to discover what has happened to her mother via flashbacks. This is an intriguing film that concentrates on how her mother going missing affects the daughter. The real mystery of the film though is just what did happen to her mother. It doesn't follow traditional storytelling techniques and bounces from place to place. This will annoy some but I think it made it a bit different to many mystery stories.I can't say I was taken with the manic performance of Eva Green as the mom which I found annoying and which detracted from the film. Thankfully though the film is driven along by great performances from Shailene Woodley as the daughter and also Christopher Meloni as the Dad. This is a strange film in many ways and far from flawless but it always grabs your attention and is a welcome change from many of today's predictable mystery thrillers. If you don't mind something a bit different this is well worth watching.
