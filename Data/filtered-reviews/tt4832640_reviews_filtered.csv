" A rightly done sports drama
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,8,"Sultan is really praiseworthy execution of a journey of a wrestler. The direction by Ali Abbas Zaffar is out n out great. The performances by the cast is quiet appealing, with Anushka Sharma's perfect performance and Salman Khan's most worthy performance. The screenplay and theme feels perfect. The plot and the storyline keeps us engaged with an inspiring flow of the movie. But there elements of forced humour and forced heroism."
" One of the best sports drama
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,10,It's a good movie to watch best performance by Salman and Anushka must watch.
" Salman best one.. don't miss
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,8,Salman all the way.. One man's struggle with himself. From Glory to downfall to Glory. Nice Direction
" Motivational story , must watch.
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Koi tume tab tak nahi hara skta jab tak tum apne aap se na haar jao.
Best performance of Megastar Salman Khan in his career . Nice sport drama with self belief."
" This was brilliant üî•
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,10,"What a film by Bhaijaan, total paisa vasool. I will not compare with Dangal but being a fictional story Sultan has shown its power"
" PATHETIC
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,1,You can not even watch it for 5 min. This guy need to learn acting from Sushant Singh Rajput.
" Bakwas...flop of the year
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,1,"Totally wastage of time & money,
Overacting is right of bullywood so called stars."
" Same old boring khan
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,1,He is the same old boring salman overacting his way to glory. Somehow all his films have same theme and very similar acting.
" Trash
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,2,"Trash film. Bad acting, poor story. Made with Jihadi agenda in mind. Boring and nauseating.

" Salman Balboa.
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,8,"Sultan review :Meet our own desi Rocky Balboa!!He's a Haryanvi dude who joins the akhaada just to patao his fellow mate Aarfa (Anushka Sharma). After an initial blissful marriage with her and a successful wrestling stint at Olympic level no less, Sultan Ali Khan (Bhaijaan, who else?) loses his way due to his arrogance. Now, he needs to take up a mega Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) tournament to prove a couple of points - personal as well as professional.Sultan is a perfect blend of adrenaline pumping action and heart tugging emotional drama which makes it a fairly engaging watch despite its predictability and near three hours of run time - something writer- director Ali Abbas Zafar should be commended for. Yea, he's the same guy who made the intolerable 'Gunday' (2014).... Undoubtedly, this is a significant leap for him!Besides the strong message of ""Never give up.."", the writing even seamlessly weaves in women equality in a scene where Sultan and Aarfa discuss over a glass of ganne ka juice. Pertinent point driven subtly without heavy duty preaching....Bravo!Obviously, the film belongs to Salman Khan and he doesn't disappoint on both fronts - usual histrionics (shirtless and casual one liners) aimed at his fans as well as an effectively restrained act to please the harshest of critics. He even gets the haryanvi accent right. After Bajrangi Bhaijaan last year, this is another sterling performance from Salman. In fact, I would rate this one a notch higher....Anushka Sharma plays the strong willed pehelwaan with √©lan. She stands tall (pun intended) besides superstar Salman delivering a knock out performance. Randeep Hooda takes forward his 'Do Lafzon Ki Kahaani' (2016) character to play Bhai's coach. He's earnest as ever. Amit Sadh as the MMA event organiser is alrite.On the tech front, editing (Rameshwar Bhagat) could have been more crisp and the second half appears stretched by atleast 15 minutes. Vishal - Shekhar's music disappoints except for the zingy ""Baby ko Bass pasand hai"" song. On the other hand, cinematography by Artur Zurawski is first rate. The sound design also deserves a special mention.Overall, Sultan is definitely recommended. It's a complete family entertainer for all ages. Moreover, Bhai delivers big time ...Go doston, have a blast in cinemas!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."
" EXCELLENT ACTING, FAB DIRECTION & SPECTACULAR UNDERDOG STORY !
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,9,"JUST GO WATCH IT !
Its more than a WORTH WATCH.
LITERALLY GOOSEBUMPS üòáüí•üî•Well I had some high expectations from SULTAN after mindblowing teaser & trailer!Honestly it stood more than the expectations.
SalmanKhan performance is just lit üî•üí•
Interval Bang is awesome and emotional.There is a Specific Scene when Salman has been totally broken down and has to prove his Stan while before that he performs an EXCELLENT ACT we may call it s "" MIRROR SCENE ""SalmanKhan is just underrated as an Actor due to his SUPER-STARDOM !"
" Salman's best performance
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,9,"Entertaining movie üé¨
It is One of my favoriteüòçüíï"
" SALMAN A MUDERER
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,1,FYI Salman khan is an actor who has been charged with murders (once he hunted a black buck and another time he killed a roadside man with his car while he was drunk)
" Cliche as others!
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,7,"Don't hate me for that title, I like the story but this movie is too much ""Clich√©"". Things I find infuriating are the fights. I understand the way Sultan fights is because he is from Wrestling background and all but the way his opponents fight is ridiculous. They stop fighting when Sultan needs a emotional moments and Start fighting when Sultan is ready. If you don't agree , watch ""Warrior"" , fights in Warrior are very Realistic and totally accurate to MMA.And whats with the montages? The training montages are twice as much as the fight itself.That got me off a bit. Acting (Accent) was fantastic though. And overall I would say , watch it if you have got nothing else to do. if you are expecting a movie as good as Bajrangi Bhaijaan, I'm sorry mate, you aren't gonna get that.Well, (re)watch Warrior, if you want to watch a great MMA kind movie. But who's gonna listen to me? Do what you want."
" Nice wrestling movie

" Salman Bhai is great
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,One of the best movie of Salman Khan. Love you Salman Bhai
" Grossly overrated
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,5,"Sultan is already 20+ and has no previous experience with wrestling. Learns wrestling for a girl and wins wins Olympic medal in 6 months beating all those who are wrestling for ages. Then retires, makes a comeback at over 40, practices for 15 days and wins a belt in mixed martial arts. Couldn't stand on his feet in final, but suddenly becomes stronger and wins the match after seeing his wife in audience. Story is a joke. Complete joke."
" Inspiring
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,9,Great acting..great storyline..with masala packed.. salman really works very hard for this..
" Anushka steals the show
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,5,"It's a mediocre sports movie. The wrestling techniques are on point, but it fails to pull emotional strings. They should have gone with a different male lead as it's an acting oriented role. I liked the first half better and Anushka lit up the screen as usual. Extremely routine climax spoiled the ending for me, but overall a decent movie."
" Ok but not good
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,1,Brothers & dangal is much better than sultan.story line is too long by forcely. That's way story is boring in some time.
" Incredible film

" Just another Bollywood movie with a superstar
",2019-07-18 00:00:00,8,"It is just a Bollywood masalaa movie with one of the Bollywood superstar which made the movie hit at box office. The movie is full of entertainment with an average storyline, and some enjoyable songs.However, neither a good story nor something extraordinary is present in the movie. Some larger than life incidents, some illogical things were portrayed."

" Just don't watch.
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,1,"Fundamentally the story of this so illogical that even pigs will laugh at the moviemakers' logic. A guy who had no training on boxing at all, becomes champion. Do you know how? Because he is in LOVE. That's what you need to win anything in life. Bollywood is becoming disgusting with these love based nonsense movies. Viewers should raise their voice against these kind of useless movies.
Shame to Bollywood.
Shame to our country of India."

" A Perfect SALMAN KHAN film!
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a perfect example of what is expected from a Salman Khan movie. 
Action, Romance, Comedy and Drama. I've watched this movie several times now and every time it makes me emotional, laugh and inspire. I strongly recommend this movie for anyone who is new to Salman Khan movies."
" Everything is predictable
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,1,What is the point of watching a movie when u know from starting what is going to hapen. Its so predictable that sultan will win and happy ending. I dont even remember what hapnd in movie as was very dull and boring.

" Wow!
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,10,"When you hear an actor in his 50s chooses to play a role like this and go through all the physical pain to create such a masterpiece how on earth can you hate him. Salman khan was offered this role in his 40s but he chose to do it in his 50s to prove you can still be in shape at this age. Aside from what a wonderful man he is, the story is so beautiful. A simple man that chooses to become wresler for love and goes through such a beautiful journey along the way. 
Also strong female character in the movie. 
What else do u need to realize this is a must watch."
" Become a perfect athlete in 1 month?
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,1,Indian audience do not use their brain at all as how can he become an athlete in 1 month because of love and can beat every wrestler in he had beaten are trained for years and he can beat all?he can also wina n olympic ...athlete starts his training at very early age like pv sindhu and give their hard to gain medal if it was so easy then people should do love someone rather than wasting time inworking hard
" Sultan (2016)
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,8,The movie was very good. Everyone acted very well in the movie. Songs and BGM in the movie was superb. Fight scenes were also good. Good movie. But 2nd half was slightly boring.
" The Best commercial movie with high emotional quotient!
",2017-11-09 00:00:00,10,The Best commercial movie with high emotional quotient!. It has all ingredients to make it a most loved and successful movie. A story of love & Relationship. A story of no where to top to fall. A story which shows real Indian culture. A story not to be missed. A story which one can achieve anything in life with dedication.
" Simply Fantastic
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,10,"Sultan (Salman Khan) becomes a wrestler to impress Aarfa (Anushka Sharma) and discovers a great talent for it. He goes on to become a world champion, but in so doing is not there when a tragedy occurs, leading to an estrangement between him and Aarfa. Ten years later, he reenters the sports world, hoping to win money for a cause dear to his heart, reestablish a relationship with his wife, and earn self respect.This is a magnificent film, with a strong and heartwarming plot. Khan takes his character through Sultan's various phases of innocence, arrogance, and brokenness believably and masterfully. He plays his role to perfection. Sharma gives a masterful performance as well. The music, songs and incidental, are good and sometimes moving. The scenery, sets, and location shots are impressive. Overall, this is a near perfect movie. I highly recommend it to both fans and non-fans (of which I am) of wrestling."
" sultan is great but not excellent
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Sultan is another masterstroke from Salman Khan. What's good: All actors performance, overall direction, music, some dialogues, action, cinematography, gripping and entertaining first half. What's bad: Editing in the second half, tiring climax, direction in some places. verdict: Sultan is different from Salman's regular flicks. It will be a universal film. People will love it. Though some aspects of the film are bad, it will be memorable for Salman's convincing performance. Randeep Hooda is fantabulous in this film."

" Frentic love for hero and hero's realism in his own private life
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,10,As much roman stacked up around the movie hero but as a matter of fact the real picture of movie star is not so comfortable to movie hero himself and worse still if somebody do frentic identify himself with hero -identification phenomenon. This 'Sultan' explores this sickness's starting story and ending.
" pure bullshit
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,1,"This movie defies all the logic and commonsense SPOILER ALERTSo story goes like this a good for nothing 30 year old idiot falls in love and starts wrestling and trains for 6 months after being rejected and goes on winning state championship, commonwealth, Olympic etc and go on to become world champion......... Are the athletes who train hard for decade long are idiots who are easily defeated by this idiot sultan this bullshit does not stop here after his divorce he goes for M.M.A. and again trains for 6 months and beat the crap out of those professional fighters and becomes world champion again W.T.F. SERIOUSLY......... This mean the years of training of those professional fighters was nothing TOTAL CRAP IT IS A 3 HOUR LONG TORTURE i am glad i did not waste 100 bucks on crap and watched it for free(you know it from where :P)"
" Never thought 'Sultan' will become one of my fav movies.
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,9,"I am not a Salman Khan Fan but this film is excellent because its about emotions, strength and being tenacious. Courage is to fail and get back again to fight. Its about keeping your spirit alive for whatsoever the reason is.""Sultan"" is an Indian romantic sports-drama film. Its a typical Bollywood movie much different to AAmir Khan's Danga. The movie should not have had so many songs which makes the movie lengthy. Never thought Sultan will become one of my fav movies. ""Khoon mein tere mitti Mitti mein tera khoon Khoon mein tere mitti Mitti mein tera khoon""""Upar Allah niche dharti Beech mein tera junoon"" are my favorite lines from the film. Films about Fighting always has takeaways. Here there are many."
" please don't use words like inspiring for a movie like this
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"How is this movie even remotely good, the only thing that is sensible is salman khan as wrestler for his body. Anushka sharma's scenes of her wrestling is really bad, and the story is not good, he turned into a wrestler with just few days or months of practice. The movie is boring and not entertaining, I wouldn't recommend you to watch this movie even if you are bored. And please in reviews elaborate how or which part inspired you. Inspiration and motivation means something else they are not magic. If u don't want to criticize, at least rate it appropriately. waste of my money and time. I understand if people rate Dangal 10, but rating this movie anything more than 6 just shows how sad people can judge stuff."
" Good Movie to watch
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"In what was probably supposed to be the most anticipated superhero movie of the year, Batman V. Superman (theatrical cut) was probably one of the most disappointing comic book movies in recent history. The theatrical cut is a decent watch, but the plot, writing and most of all, scene editing is absolutely mediocre in this film. Whether this was Zack Snyder's, or Warner Bros fault, the editing of this extremely anticipated movie was a disaster, as people say the much fuller, directors cut of this film is almost like an entirely different movie.While seeing Ben Affleck's Batman was fun, the overly revealing trailers, god awful pacing, and ridiculous plot errors, gave the DCEU the bashing they certainly didn't want. While we were all certainly rooting for Batman V. Superman, even the biggest DCEU supporters (like myself) couldn't look past the massive editing and plot errors of this film."
" Can watch this once if you are looking ONLY for entertainment and no sense
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"Though movie gives lots of wrong messages, it is still fun to watch A young man who is in his twenty's.He has no aim in life.He has no passion in life.He is not serious about his life.He has no big dreams.One day, he see a girl wresting with male wrestlers and instantly fall in love with her. ( Love at first sight, Typical Bollywood!) They became friends. Girl thinks that they are just friends. Boy thinks they are lovers because that girl has spent one day with him on his bike! Girl says,""Love does not happen like this. Love happens when you respect somebody. When you see that someone has a unique quality that you don't have. I have a dream. I know what i want in life. You are just an aimless joker!"" Obviously, now boy's ego is destroyed.He goes to her father's training center for wrestling and challenge 1 professional wrestler and loses against him. Now, he challenges his father that he will return after one month challenge his 3 wrestlers.He practiced very hard for one month, returns and beats 3 professional wrestlers in one try.(WRONG MESSAGE 1 : Take note that those 3 professional wrestlers are training for at least 20 years and this friend-zoned lover beats them after just one month of training.Highest insult to the professional wrestlers. ) Wait, Wait this is not over! Girl falls in love with him after this heroic victory! They get married! He does training for another 6 months and won Gold-Medals in every competition! Including Commonwealth games, Asian games, World Championship.Still, Our hero's heroism is not finished.Best part comes now!! That girl also done progressed in her career with her husband.She got pregnant! Her father told her that she destroyed her 20 years of training. Why didn't you control yourself.She answered that my love , my husband will fulfill my dream of winning Olympic medal. ( Indian people love when a female sacrifice something for her male! ) (WRONG MESSAGE - 2 : One girl who trained herself from childhood for her dream, can't imagine how many sacrifices she made in these 20 years to fulfill her one dream.And she is ready to give on all her hard-work, for what? To make someone a father! ( Really !) But, as i said this is what Indian people want to watch , this is what Indian writers want to write!)"
" An heartland tale of love and redemption
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,9,"With his back facing us, he struts out of the dark alley to the ring like a celestial being, little streaks of sunlight pouring from the shafts above in quantity just enough to fashion the contours of his silhouette with gold dust as the chant in the background goes-""Khoon mein tere Mitti, Mitti mein tera Khoon; Upar Allah, Neeche Dharti; Beech mein tera Junoon"". The crowds in the movie become delirious as Sultan makes a grand entrance,as the crowd in the theatre goes berserk at the first sight of Salman. Salman's playing his favourite alter ego- that of a man child with a magnetic charm for the infinite time to the same effect; this time he's called Sultan.A quintessential Bhai movie is nothing but an elaborate vanity exercise comprising of-catchy numbers, quirky signature steps and fourth wall breaking sequences with iconic lines when Bhai is done breaking some bones. Sultan does all this and much more. It gives us a protagonist who is not saddled with the task of catering to the legion of fans of the star alone. He is a fallible person, who crumbles under the impact of defeat. He is an illiterate who knows to handle the rejection of a woman with dignity. He is a desi wrestler who's Ko move is punctuated with an obeisance.Sultan manages the hitherto unmanageable feat of trespassing beyond the ""Salman"" persona to an unchartered territory called acting, that Bajrangi Bhaijaan almost managed to do.The road to redemption is staged on screen in an invigorating fashion through the subtle deployment of a few processes as metaphorical devices . Insulted by the woman he loves for the dearth of purpose in his life, he embarks on a journey of self discovery .He starts off with a clear-face shakily,tilling a field singlehandedly to chasing beside a local train. The train zooms past him and there's a lot left to plow in the field. As he makes progress; he's grown a thick stubble now. He almost manages to match the train and the field has significantly been cleared; his limits stretched. By the end of his metamorphosis- the stubble has turned a marked moustache; he races past the train with the field burning ready for cultivation. A new man is born.There is this point in the movie where a worn out Sultan, past his prime is trying to stage a comeback. He takes his shirt off before the mirror.What he sees is an image of a man who is not just out of shape, but buried beneath the debris of despair and defeat. He implodes with anguish as even his shirt wouldn't peacefully let him sneak in to it. It is one of the rare occasions where our hearts go out in unison for this man, overlooking the star portraying him. Sedentary at soul, he is this lackadaisical individual who wakes up to his potential after instigation. For success has often been his retaliation to instigation- a recurring motif in his life. If Aarfa instigated him with her insult to turn him into a world renown wrestler earlier, a coach now calls him a dead person from the ringside while he gets beaten to pulp, trying to resurrect his carrier in a new form after a sabbatical. Phat comes the killer move - as if in response - as he lays still his opponent.He springs out of the ring defiantly to tell this man, verbally now that he might have quit wrestling, but never stopped fighting.The romance isn't a gratuitous embellishment to ratify song sequences. It constitutes the very heart and soul of the movie.It gives us his love interest Aarfa, an ambitious-strong woman, an Adrian to his Rocky(just that she's is a wrestler much before he wanted to be one.) She just isn't there as his prosaic arm candy, but insinuates the necessary friction in his life from time to time. There's a beautiful trait she exhibits every time when Sultan makes progress towards something great; she turns away from the happening solicitously. She doesn't want to spectate, but rather participate vicariously in his travails moment by moment. She does this when he enrols as a green horn wrestler to take part in a state level championship. She does this while coaching kids with her back facing the TV playing his MMA matches.These finer aspects go on to enhance the relatability of the larger than life proceedings, the stuff that we seldom expect out of a Salman starrer. There is this scene where he watches his wedding night's video after dinner in isolation. As the shot segues from the video to his room, he's fallen asleep watching himself fall asleep in the video. We get to know that the nostalgia held in the video is his lullaby. For once the sight of Bhai is not just the excuse to wolf whistle alone, but a calming influence."
