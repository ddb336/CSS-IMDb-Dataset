" A very poor step down from the first movie
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,5,"Overall I did not enjoy this film that much, mostly because I was expecting it to be as good as the first movie and was left sorely disappointed.This movie isn't terrible by any means, but it's certainly a step down from the original movie and almost everything about it is worse.It's a good premise, but I just feel like a lot of potential here was wasted. The pacing is really weird, the plot is all over the place, going from point A to point B within a matter of seconds. The music is fit into the movie very weirdly. There's hardly any build-up and the characters just act kind of dumb. I know a lot of people will disagree with me here but I also felt it just wasn't that funny. Burger beard's character just felt very bizarre, and the whole time travelling aspect seemed really random. It feels like there's a little too much ""magic"" going on which somehow brings the story forward. I know SpongeBob has never been the most realistic show going but the whole thing with the book was very strange and made it seem like the writers didn't know how to progress the story without using it is a scapegoat(for example SpongeBob and the gang writing themselves to be massive musclemen - it's just strange...). Then there's the whole thing with the all-knowing dolphin, and again, it just takes the unrealistic aspect of it up to too much of a notch and seems like they're writing the plot as it goes along.A few things I did like about this movie however was the animation(gorgeous, both the 2D and 3D aspects so basically the whole film). The music in this movie was decent(although the name-drop of Lil Wayne in the song ""Squeeze Me"" was pretty weird. All of the major characters actually play a role in this movie which is also nice. There's also quite a lot going on in the movie in general which will keep a lot of kids entertained, especially the scenes when they're out of water.If you've never seen the first movie you may enjoy this more, but in context of that one this one really doesn't hold up, I'm disappointed to say. I wanted to like this one, I really did.5 stars - Average. Not good but not bad eitherPros: Includes most of the major SpongeBob characters and they actually have purpose, the animation is stellar throughout the whole movie, there's a lot happening in it to entertain kidsCons: The plot/pacing, the ""magic"" and time-travelling aspects, bizarre and not that funny."
" Hey,Spongebob's back
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Either if you love or hate him we all know what Spongebob is. I'll quickly discuss my stand on Spongebob. Seasons 1-3 were perfect,Seasons 4-5 and 10 were great,and Seasons 6-9 and 11 were okay. I haven't seen all of Season 12 so I don't know how it is as a whole yet. I've also seen the other two movies. There's no denying that the first was perfect and was meant as the series finale,and I even liked the third one. So what's my stand on this movie,well I think it's worse then the original,but better then the third. I think it's worse then the original because I think what they were promoting wasn't what they exactly promised and the writing got predictable at moments. However the animation,characters,acting,and humor are all fantastic. This is a great movie for die hard Spongebob fans like me and it's a great comedy on it's own,even if you never watched the show they recap everything perfectly so you don't have to worry about watching the show. People who hate Spongebob will understandably not like this at all,but at the end of the day I really love it and I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia."
" 8/10
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,8,This SpongeBob movie is good compared to the last one. The last one is like what plankton does in the SpongeBob seasons this one is a little bit different he teams up with SpongeBob which was good and funny at the same time I did like that the villain was the pirate it was so refreshing to SpongeBob series as a whole
" Unoriginal and unfunny!!!!!!
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,1,Because it is badly animated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
" The g of movies
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,10,I loved this movie it has got too be the funniest of all movies on earth
" Good Movie
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,6,"This movie was on my 'Watchlist' for pretty long time, although I am not a big fan of 'SpongeBob SquarePants' TV show.Well, I really was amazed; the story has an uncomplicated plot, but at the same time very entertaining.So if you didn't have the opportunity to watch this movie before, my advice is to grab your popcorn and beer, and get ready for 1 hour and 32 minutes of fun."
" I actually enjoyed this movie.
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,"I mean, it's not a masterpiece but it keeps the show's soul that once had before the first film, it's dumb yes, pretty bizarre, but still enjoyable and fun. I have not doubt that fans from the show will like the movie."
" good and bad
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,5,"So lets start , when watching this they changed the style first of all , but watching the d animation didn't take a lot away from the original carton , maybe lacked a bit of life but it has lost some charm and creativity of how to stretch the characters , like the French narration voice is gone , which was not good , because that was a big part of the show .while watching this move it looks nice and was good to watch but growing up watching sponge bob , they ruined the origin story of all the characters like how they met as babies which never happened , but also the voices of the younger characters were terrible which took a lot away from the show.while the character seemed like themselves , they were all diluted version of then selves , with nothing new to offer , the spark has gone from them all, sponge bob was annoying but it was nothing we hadn't seen before , Patrick was not as dumb as he should be , squid ward was slightly mad at thing for a minute , mr crabs care a little about money and plankton was good , they all lacked their original personality .if you watch this for the first time and know nothing of sponged bob , its good to see and kids may also love it but if you grew up watching sponge bob it will not be as good as the first movie which was never as good as the show"
" The best one!
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,"Didn't had high hopes for this sequel, BUT IT WAS A BLAST! From the story to the real life setting, awesome! Time travel plot was executed perfectly! And you can even say that this the best one out of the SpongeBob movie trilogy!"
" An OK movie
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,7,"This movie, although, still influenced by Stephen Hillenburg, it's not as great and memorable as the first movie at all.I'm not saying that this movie sucks, it still is funny and the part where they added Plankton and Spongebob help each other in getting back the formula is really nice.I also like the part where they use time travel. Although, it wasn't as good as SB-129's time traveling concept, it still makes the movie very interesting. You know, saving the future by going back to the past is a good concept.Bubbles... I do not know what to say about Bubbles, how is he able to stop Saturn and Jupiter from crashing into each other while Spongebob and Plankton can't? Also, the part where he gets sick of his job and wants to help Spongebob and the crew breathe air is... ok? I guess.Finally, I would want to say that although this movie isn't as funny and brilliant as the first one. It is still a good movie to watch, although, do not watch it if you just watched it like a week ago, you MAY get bored."
" SpongeBob SquarePants
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,6,"Just as good as the first movie with improved animation and the use of 3d animation.Can't wait for ""the SpongeBob movie sponge on the run"""
" Silly fun
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,6,"This film is not as good as the first SpongeBob film but it is still entertaining. It has plenty of moments that remind me of the old episodes. It does feel like a very extended episode rather than a full movie for some reason. Probably all the disconnected zany moments. Nothing special, but fun for fans."
" Keep him in water
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,7,"The first hour of the movie is just a long episode, and it works and keeps you entertained.The last half-hour is just sad, because you can see how the character breaks to try to empathize with the new audience.
It is like seeing our grandparents trying to talk in a younger language, to fit their grandchildren.
It transforms into a superhero movie, with a bizarre 20 minutes action sequence, and when we are finally going to get back to normal, there is a weird rap interrupting the good ending and the good taste it could still leave us.If this was not a pretext to fit, they could use Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, and make a nice 2D SpongeBob superhero great movie, but it was a pretext.I think SpongeBob doesn't need to be a superhero to be still in the hearts of the young people, and that is why the first movie is still way, way much better."
" Jedi Antonio Banderas
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,6,"Better than I was expecting considering the show kinda went the way of the Simpsons, good but not great. Antonio Banderas stole the show.The music was weak compared to what we're used to from SpongeBob and no real emotional moment like the first film. It did have a joke or two for adults though."
" Sponge Out of Water
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,1,"I'm definitely getting a ""cringey fanfiction"" vibe from this one. I enjoyed the rap battle at the end, but it's just post-credits extra and the only thing keeping this thing from a 0."
" A worthy sequel
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"I have to admit, I was skeptical when I heard that there was another Spongebob movie coming out, considering that the first movie was supposed to be the series finale, and since the original creator of the show, Stephen Hillenburg left after the first movie, the show had kind of declined in quality. However, Hillenburg is back for this movie, and is returning to the series! It really shows that he has returned, as the movie has plenty of well-written jokes for everyone. Is it as good as the first movie? No, but it's not the train-wreck I initially thought it was going to be. Also, don't believe the trailers and posters. Only the last half-hour is spent in the ""real world"" where Spongebob and his friends are CGI. I thought this film was really clever, and was laughing throughout. The one thing that bothers me, is that in the series, when Spongebob and his friends go above water, they are puppets. (Or in Spongebob's case, a real sponge.) They look just like their cartoon selves the whole time in this movie. (Except for Sandy. She's a real squirrel on land.) Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and it reawakened the 7-year-old in me, when the first movie came out. The plot felt a bit rushed, but by the end, I left with a smile on my face.
Grade: A-, 9/10, 4/5 stars"
" it´s cool but...
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,7,"It's cool, but the story is tired of knowing from Bob's cartoon series. And the only ""original"" part that would be their part outside the water is so boring"
" THE SPONGEBOB MOVIE: SPONGE OUT OF WATER
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,2,"""THE SPONGEBOB MOVIE: SPONGE OUT OF WATER"" (2015, Tibbitt ) exhibits none of the classic Spongebob Squarepants wit and is less nautical nonsense than silly cliche ridden big budget kids film that spoofs a lot of things (in this case ""PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN"" (2003, Verbinski) and ""MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDER-DOME"" (1985, Miller), as well as it's own lore).I am a big fan of Spongbob having watched every episode more than twice and the first film many times but this instalment feels weak and childish, not to mention forced.I thought the addition of Matt Berry was inspired, but ultimately ruined and the film's theme song is rubbish."
" It's better than modern SpongeBob, not as good as the episodes in the pre-movie seasons or the first movie
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,6,"I think this movie receives way too much hate, sure it's not as good as the first movie or the pre-movie episodes, but it's still really gunny and highly enjoyable. People should get the nostalgia sticks out. This movie has the same rating as Cars 2, which is actually a trash movie, on IMDb, which is totally absurd and ridiculous. Is it as good as original SpongeBon or the first movie? No, of course not, but it's an improvement over the crappy 6-8th seasons that ran before this movie came out."
" The Best Movie in the World.
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,10,I am a HUGE spongebob Squarepants fan and the only negative thing I can say about this movie was that it was not long enough with a run time of 92 minutes I would have preferred a 2hour movie but oh well. The voice actors are great as they are in the show and the Animation and cgi looks great as well as the music being phenomenal. Antonio banderis as the pirate burger beard was great gosh I didn't want it to end.
" Nice
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,6,"After winning theaters in 2004 (yes, it's been more than ten years since Bob Esponja - The Movie), the most beloved porifer of Bikini Bottom stumbles upon returning to the format in SpongeBob - A Hero Out of Water, with a rambling and too nonsense script - even for the character's lysergic patterns.Written in eight hands (including those of the creator of the original series, Stephen Hillenburg, and director Paul Tibbitt, also responsible for the first film), the story begins like many of the adventures of Square Pants: with the small and ambitious Plankton, the owner of Bucket of Garbage, bothered by the success of Siri Cascudo. He traces a true war strategy to steal the formula of the crab burger, the basis of the population of the Bikini Bottom.Something goes wrong and the recipe disappears, leaving the once peaceful community on the verge of apocalypse. However, as if a villain was not enough, the pirate Barba Burguer (Antonio Banderas, very funny), is also interested in the formula, since he owns a food truck (great idea!), Which has the delicacy as a car- boss. And, alongside the inseparable Patrick, Lula Molusco, Sandy and Mr. Sirigueijo, Esponja will have to join forces with Plankton to achieve his goals.So far, so good. But, in addition to a magic book that allows rewriting history, the plot still involves a kind of ""fairy godmother"" dolphin and a time travel machine that takes the focus off the group's purpose. The broth overflows.Practically all (vast) promotional material of the film had as a decoy the 3D format of the characters out of the water (hence the title), when they are transformed into superheroes. A new dimension worthy of credit, since the main characteristics of the crazy group were maintained, both visually (with the use of cutting edge technology) and dramatically (since each ""hero"" corresponds to a power that matches his own personality) - and the solution found for Sandy's new outfit is very creative. (The mix with the live action universe had already happened in other moments of the series and also in the previous feature, but without all the pomp of resources possible today).The transformation takes place only in the third act of the film, all focused on action scenes, with the clear intention of embracing a younger audience. For children, in addition to the new visual appeal, there are still edifying messages, especially in the Bob and Plankton alliance, which is still a merit. And, as two thirds of the production takes place based on the good old 2D, as if it were a long episode, the option should please the older ones.However, the end result is more confusing than funny. But, ""how?"", The fervent invertebrate fan, who watched the hilarious trailers released by the film's production, must be asking. That's the problem, dear cotton candy eater. Virtually all the good jokes were used in the previous videos. For One Hero Out of Water, there was only one left, already in the resolution of the film, involving an ""inheritance"" for Lula Molusco. (Hehe. This is a really good one).I liked this review by AdoroCinema"
" Cartoonish
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,5,Not a fan of the TV show but the preview looked funny but all the laughs were in the trailer. They should have spent more time out of the water then the last 20 min of the movie.
" It's a popular series
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,3,"I'm not a fan of SpongeBob or anything, but I always see this everywhere, especially on television screens, so I decided to see a movie called the ""The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water"", and I was impressed. I found the characters very interesting, and I was keen to find out what this series is about through this movie more than anything, really. I particularly enjoyed the final part of the movie - that was so cool! Nothing else to say really."
" Spongebob is a bad show for your children
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,1,This is making my child hurt other children phsically and mentally.this is driving me crazy and my son now only watches educational shows like Team Umizoomi and bubble guppies these are the shows your children should watch check it out its great!!!
" Very Disappointed!!!!!
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,1,"I have tried to give Spongebob another chance after a few episodes with words I would never let my 4 year old say. After watching or attempting to watch the Christmas episode, all i kept hearing was the work ""Jerk"". I actually ended up turning the channel because what makes it ok for children to be exposed to this language in a cartoon? The cartoon needs to be made to the point where we don't have to supervise what they are watching. I have told my kids that they are no longer able to watch this cartoon anymore. very disappointed!"
" I don't like it
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,1,"I watched this movie in 2015, expecting the worst. That same year I had already been let down by Paul blart: mall cop 2. This movie makes me very sad because today's kids might not have seen the original movie! The animation is revolting and I don't remember plot."
" Yes
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,10,"Adorably perfect, I've watched spongebob since the beginning (i'm 31) and they couldn't have done it better. Love"
" Not for kids. Offbeat, strange and fun.
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,10,"This movie is hilarious, but not really for kids, but really has spongebob really ever been for kids? This film is weird and funky and swings hard and loose, but is wildly entertaining in that is is stupidly funny."
" Spongebob baby
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,6,It was actually good but I will never rate an animation more than 6 star
" Just as great as the first one
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,8,"The title's a little misleading but if you can get past that you'll find an enjoyable film. This's one of few sequels that are just as great as the first one. As usual, Plankton tries to steal Mr. Krabs' formula only to be stopped by Spongebob and Patrick. Even when he does get close to getting it it disappears in front of him and Spongebob. It's revealed that a pirate named Burger Beard (Antonio Banderas) used magic to get the formula himself in order to open his own restaurant. This forces Spongebob and Plankton to team up together while gradually having friends join their side in order to retrieve it. While doing so Spongebob struggles to teach Plankton the concept of friendship. If that's not enough they deal with several trippy scenarios such as time travel.All this leads to Spongebob and his friends traveling on land this time in computer form to face Burger Beard once and for all. The animation's just as great as the first one. I like how the characters are now computer animated but at the same time it retains the energy of the show. I really like how they transform into superheroes as part of a magic book leading to some awesome yet funny scenes. The characters act how you'd expect which isn't a bad. The only character that shows signs of character development is Plankton. It's cool to see him change his ways until after they return to Bikini Bottom. Burger Beard is your typical over-the-top villain and he's a really good one.I guess my only nitpicks are that there're a lot of sub-plots that don't really go anywhere. It's mostly filler. The scene where Plankton goes inside Spongebob's brain in a failed attempt to learn the formula is funny but it goes by fast. I feel like more could've been done with that by showing different parts of Spongebob's brain as well as more of Spongebob's psyche. As I said earlier the title's misleading: They only go to land towards the end of the movie. Even with that being said I still enjoyed it as it was well done. Sponge Out of Water is a great kids movie that adults will like too. It has bouncy animation, a good story, hilarious jokes, memorable characters and great animation. There's something for everyone here. I highly recommend this movie."
" love it
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,10,I liked it better than the first movie great music and plot to this fantastic movie.
" This felt a bit like Chicken Little meets The Avengers
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,5,"Even though I hate Spongebob, I thought this movie was average. It was kind of weird to have an apocalypse because Plankton was about to steal the formula but it dissappears. So Mr. Krabs and all the Bikini Bottom Residents think Plankton is lying and then Mr. Krabs tortures Plankton by taping him on Mr. Krabs' desk while Spongebob laughs it off, until Plankton is driven crazy by Spongebob's laughs. I want to say this. This movie had some gross jokes. Ex: The Seagulls crapping. One of the Seagulls takes a crap, and then there's one scene where all of the seagulls are about to crap all over our main villain Burgerbeard. There's a bunch of jokes like that. For some reason whats with the Main Characters turning into Avengers-esque Superheroes?? It seemed kind of silly, especially with Patrick having ice cream superpowers. In the trailer you may have seen him using his powers to levitate a bunch of ice cream or something like that, and then we think he's about to use them as weapons, but he eats the ice cream, with Spongebob saying ""We should've given you a better superpower, Patrick"". This movie reminds me of Chicken Little because of having some mean spirited scenes, like when Spongebob grabbed the wrong secret formula, with a note saying ""Eat My Sub-Aquatic Bubbles"" from Plankton. And then Plankton is saying these hurtful things to SB like when he said ""You're the worst teammate ever!!"" and then Spongebob goes out of his mind and mixes trash together. I also thought that when Mr. Krabs tortured Plankton with Spongebob's laughs was kinda mean spirited too. Overall 5/10"
" Quick Review
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,5,"A quick, funny, adventurous Picture, that have the SpongeBob characters, but not much of the SpongeBob soul! To be fair, the first half is exactly want a fan of the series want to see in a Motion Picture, but then, the second half happened!Do not misunderstand me. I have a really fun time with the movie, but did it really need to have a superhero finale? Cause I believe, it really did not!"
" A bit of a disappointment...and a bit heartless.
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,3,"While I enjoyed the first SpongeBob movie as well as the television series, I was less than enthralled by ""The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water"". This is because unlike these other SpongeBobs, this movie is not written well and the characters are a bit heartless and behave oddly to say the least.The film begins with Plankton making yet another attempt to steal the Krabby Patty formula. While it looks to nearly everyone that Plankton DID finally steal the formula, SpongeBob realizes that some unseen force stole it instead. But no one listens to SpongeBob and soon all of Bikini Bottom turns into a weird post-apocalyptic world...much like a Mad Max film. So, it's up to Plankton and SpongeBob to travel through time and somehow steal the formula BEFORE it's stolen! In the process, they get some help from a weird dolphin.
The biggest problem about this movie is that I was saddened to see EVERYONE in Bikini Bottom becoming so hateful towards SpongeBob so quickly. The film definitely lacked heart and seemed uncharacteristic when they wanted to sacrifice SpongeBob!! Because of this and the overall dark tone of the story, it's not an especially good picture for younger viewers....plus it really lacks fun...especically in the extended CGI sequence near the end."
" 7
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,7,I love spongebob so it's a bit subjective opinion but still found this film attractive.
" This movie is good

But this movie is funny and have a great and awsome action
Animation is very nice
Characters is so funny and cool."
" A film ever SpongeBob fan should adore!
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,10,"Every child in their lifetime at some point has always wanted an action-filled SpongeBob movie, I know I did. Sponge out of water is a huge treat! It should please all our inner children because of the story itself! SpongeBob and his friends get powers to find the krabby Patty secret formula! Simple and awesome at the same time! I love this film!"
" Blummin good fun!

" The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,7,"I probably only watched one or two full episodes of the popular Nickelodeon show, which was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons, but I enjoyed the first movie featuring the sponge named Bob with square pants, I was definitely up for another movie, a stand-alone sequel that followed a decade later. Basically a pirate named Burger Beard (Antonio Banderas) travels to Bikini Atoll, opening a treasure chest he obtains a magical book with the power to make any words written into it a reality. The book tells the story of SpongeBob SquarePants (Tom Kenny), the over-optimistic sea sponge who lives in Bikini Bottom, he works in the Krusty Krab restaurant. The owner Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) has spent several years protecting the secret Krabby Patty formula from his restaurant rival Plankton, owner of the Chum Bucket. One day, Plankton attacks the Krusty Krab and attempts to steal the formula, after a fight he appears to accept defeat, but he uses a decoy of himself, while the real Plankton gains access to Krabs' vault, stealing the formula, leaving a fake in its place. SpongeBob catches Plankton and they engage in a tug of war over the formula, but it magically disappears before either of them can claim it. Without the secret formula, no Krabby Patties can be made, causing customers to become ravenous, SpongeBob is the only who believes Plankton is innocent and creates a large soap bubble for them fly away in and escape. Bikini Bottom is immediately reduced to an apocalyptic wasteland, due to the absence of the Krabby Patty. SpongeBob proposes he and Plankton team up to find the formula, Plankton does not quite understand the concept of teamwork. Plankton comes up with the idea to build a time machine, to travel back in time to the moment when the formula disappeared, they are helped by the most intelligent computer possible, Plankton's computer wife Karen (Jill Talley). They assemble the time machine, but end up travelling to the future, where they meet magical dolphin Bubbles (Matt Berry) who acts as an overseer of the galaxy, they cause him to lose his job. They then travel back in time and succeed in retrieving the formula, only for them to realise they inadvertently grabbed the fake. Burger Beard converts his pirate ship into a food truck to sell Krabby Patties at a beach resort, while the town are about to sacrifice SpongeBob to ""appease the sandwich gods"", when he and Mr. Krabs smell Krabby Patties. SpongeBob, Patrick Star (Bill Fagerbakke), Mr. Krabs, Squidward Tentacles (Rodger Bumpass) and Sandy Cheeks (Carolyn Lawrence) follow the scent to the surface. Then Bubbles shows up, he says he actually hated his job, and repays the sea creatures by giving them the ability to breathe on land, and launches them from his blowhole to the surface. The team land on the beach, finding the smell of Krabby Patties coming from Burger Beard's food truck, the pirate used the magical book and rewrote the story to steal the secret formula for himself. Burger Beard then writes the magical book to banish the gang to Pelican Island, but SpongeBob uses a discarded page from the book to transform himself and the others into superheroes with special powers. They become The Invincibubble (SpongeBob), Mr. Superawesomeness (Patrick), Sour Note (Squidward), The Rodent (Sandy), and Sir Pinch-a-Lot (Mr. Krabs). Seeing them return, Burger Beard flees with the formula and they give chase, during the battle, the team manage to destroy the book, but the pirate overpowers them one by one. But Plankton saves them, transformed into the muscle-bound Plank-Ton, the Krabby Patty formula is retrieved, Burger Beard is sent flying and banished to Bikini Atoll, and Plankton returns to the formula to Mr. Krabs. In the end, the city of Bikini Bottom is finally restored and Plankton reassumes his status as a business rival, everything is returned to the status quo. Also starring Dee Bradley Baker as Perch Perkins and seagulls voiced Kevin Michael Richardson, Billy West, Alan Carr (UK) and Stacey Solomon (UK). This is another obvious slice of self-aware silliness and absurdity, the plucky leading character is loveably eccentric, fans of the show will enjoy the bigger scale adventure for the aquatic hero, the mix of live action, including the amusing Banderas, and fantastic computer animation, and newcomers to the whole thing will also have fun, lots of laughs and entertainment for all the family, a great live action/animated comedy adventure. Very good!"
" Sponge Out Of Water absorbs all the lunacy and humour from the TV series through its animated pores.
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,6,"I. Love. SpongeBob. I just do. Me and Mr Squarepants understand each other on a level of hilarity. He is the sponge to my shower. The pants to my drawers. For SpongeBob to receive the film treatment again is something that we truly will never appreciate. Magnificent. But, let's face it, it's just an extended episode. The Krabby Patty secret formula has been stolen by a pirate who uses a magical book to make any text come true. It's up to SpongeBob and gang to, once again, journey on an expedition to reach the surface. Firstly, if you don't like SpongeBob, why would you watch this? Secondly, if you don't like SpongeBob, what's wrong with you!? I jest, it's understandable that the high-pitched anthropomorphic sponge is an eclectic taste. Yet, not even for nostalgia purposes, I warm to his innocence. The slight dynamic change, in this case of Plankton ""te-am-ing"" up with Spongebob, did feel refreshing (although has been done before with the wonderful ""F is for friends who do stuff""...ok I'll stop). The crazy antics are ever present, from Plankton flying a plane to driving a tank to controlling a giant robot just to get the secret formula, which will appeal to younger audiences and fans of the beloved series. Solid message throughout, humorous in several places and Berry voicing a time-travelling dolphin named Bubbles. It's...It's the stuff of Shakespeare. Alas, I've never been a fan of animation blending with live-action and unfortunately, as creative as the last act was, it just didn't work for me. The plot was clearly becoming expired at that point and Tibbitt tried an alternative route. Commendable, but disposable. Also, not enough Squidward. It just feels as if these films need to discover a more inventive plot. Recovering the secret formula is something best suited to a TV episode. We need a more cinematic scope to capture the epic character that is SpongeBob. Nautically nonsensical, humorous throughout and a rapid pace makes for a nice easy watch for fans and children."
" The rating is totally wrong
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,9,"My assumption is people just say new spongebob sucks and automatically assume it sucks. Quite the contrary. They'd be pretty surprised to probably learn the original creator and writer came back to help make this movie. They used a lot of older humor and elements in general that made it feel like something from seasons 1-3. It was enjoyable to watch, and much better than I had expected."
" Trash!
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,3,The jokes are not that funny. The humor is not that good. I don't know why they thought of making another one. It isn't that good. Watch it if you like but don't have any promises.
" Worst movie ever
",2018-03-27 00:00:00,1,Don't watch this garbage spongebob Is a disgrace to other cartoons and they were only out of water for 10 minuets. The whole movie should have been out of water. This movie is worse then The Emoji Movie.
" Well Done, but not good!
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,5,"This movie is completely awful! It's for younger kids! I absolutely love SpongeBob and to compare this with the show, it was a complete letdown! Awfully good!"
" Takes things to crazy places with an inventive vigour and a lavish style.
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,6,"Much is made of the flick's CGI final movement in which our heroes take a step onto live-action land, but the majority of 'The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out Of Water (2015)' plays out in fantastic, elastic 2D animation that brings the form back to the big-screen in a big way and should not be overlooked. The feature itself isn't so much a sequel or a continuation but rather a weird and whacky head-trip featuring the characters from the show. It's a stand-alone story that takes things to crazy places with an inventive vigour and a lavish, if watered-down, style. It isn't anywhere near as funny - or, indeed, as good - as its predecessor, mostly due to its humour being based largely around bad puns, and it does start to wear a bit thin in places. Still, it manages to be generally entertaining throughout. 6/10"
" Surreal and Funny
",2017-11-17 00:00:00,10,"The film has kept the original surreal feel that I have grown up with. The comedy was the same as usual, brilliant has the humour for children and adults. There was a scene where plankton and spongebob time travel to a dolphin master race that rule over the galaxy stopping asteroids hitting the earth. The dolphin there has to go to the toilet after 10,000 years and asks spongebob to look. While he watches Jupiter and Saturn hit each other and the dolphin attacks spongebob and plankton.The film has a certain atmosphere of nostalgia and comedy. The film maintains the original feel of spongebob but adds a 3D atmosphere later in the film, I will criticise the fact that there is a different pirate. I don't know if the actor who played Patchy refused to play or has died or just wasn't written but spoils the feel of the the 3D part.This film I cannot recommend enough."
" ""The Spongebob Movie"" has been rewashed much too many times for any sponge to handle.
",2017-10-11 00:00:00,4,"Unlike other kids films such as ""Toy Story"", ""Spongebob"" is not a family movie, most likely being depicted as annoying to anyone above the age of ten. Despite this, the corny, cliché jokes in the animation half of the film manage to procure laughs and make for an entertaining first 45 minutes or so. Unfortunately, these jokes dissolve into a nonsensical story-line involving space dolphins and super powers for each of the primary characters. The film is prolonged due to a pirate ship-tank-food truck wielding pirate/cook who just wants to make a good burger. As the movie continues, the story-line is twisted and strained for no reason, thus making it more of a flop than a funny. The idea for super-powered primary characters is an obvious and unnecessary marketing ploy which falls flat on its face, adding nothing to the film."
" Stonedbob Garbagepants
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,4,What begins with M and rhymes with less? Thats right! Mess. Thats what this film is. a faint stink by the bin. I got the privilege to watch on the Burmese premiere and I was as stoned as a stone. it did trip me out however that doesn't make this a good film. it is clearly made by some man-child who doesn't understand life.what flipped me off is Patrick Star and how god damn incompetent he is. Also Squidmanchild is just as grouchy as a certain geek called Lee. I rate this 4 as there was some trip moments but other than that this film fried my head electric red and now I have 22 brain cells
" Great movie, but not as legendary as the first.
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,10,"SpongeBob, man, does it get old! It took 11 years for Nickelodeon to release a second movie. Just like it took 13 years for Hey Arnold The Jungle Movie. But anyway, it's a pretty good movie, it had many good jokes and laughable humor, just not laughoutloud, you know what I mean. Here are my pros and cons.Pros: - Well thought-out synopsis - Great voice-acting - Laughable humor - Many good jokes - Great animation/CGI animating - Lovable characters - Slow-but-steady character developmentCons: - The movie is called ""Sponge Out of Water"" for a reason. It took the gang more than 70 minutes to get on land. - Not as legendary as the first movie. The reason why I say this is because it ended the movie on a good note. The reason why I say THAT is because of Ocean Man. Amazing song and it fit well in the end. But it might have been better off not having more seasons after it. However, I feel seasons 9B-10 so far have given the show more hope, now that Hillenburg is back with his SQUAD. What do you get when you cross an adult music band and an animated movie? Ocean Man in SpongeBobSo there's my review of it."
" Why Sponge Bob is a great person
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,10,"The movie was super awesome. And I loved it very much.I like the part where sponge bob battles burger beard. It was an awesome movie and they should not change the movie at all. It should stay the same. I still loved the movie and sponge bob is my favorite character out of all the characters in Bikini Bottom. Lol sponge bob. U rock on. Plus, it is still an awesome movie. They shouldn't change the movie at all. If only sponge bob square pants was a real person. Then, I can meet him and tell him how he is a great person he is. Plus I wish Bikini Bottom was a real place to go. I love u sponge bob. U rock. I love u. U are a great person dude."
" Average. That's the saddest thing that can ever be said about Spongebob.
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,4,"Advertising is somewhat misleading for every product. But almost all of the trailers for this movie advertise a CGI SpongeBob superhero movie. Unfortunately, not even 25% of this movie is dedicated to that kind of film. It's a 78 minute SpongeBob cartoon with a 15 minute CGI segment. Besides my expectations, this was fine. It did everything it had to. It had interesting parts, and got a few laughs out of me (ironically). I am also not the proper age group for this movie, which is most likely a huge factor of why I think this movie is fine. If I was say, 6 years old, this would have been my favorite film of all time. They are defiantly going to make a sequel to this movie (as it is a factor of the SpongeBob property, which has millions and millions of dollars), and I have faith that I will enjoy the next one un-ironically. As I say, a bad movie is better than a boring movie. Bad/((Boring))/Good/Fantastic Final Rating: Boring..."
" Better then I remembered
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,8,"I remember watching this movie in theaters and I thought it was terrible, it was somewhat a let-down to me. But, I was a cynical baby and I heard good reviews on the internet and decided to watch it again. I enjoyed it much more this time. I found the jokes much funnier, and saw the many hilarious backgrounds. Example, when Karen was chained in the room there were writings saying ""ctrl-alt-del"" and many other awesome jokes. Great movie!"
" I think any Spongebob fan, new or old can find some enjoyment out of this movie
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,7,"I'll start by saying, this movie isn't terrible, but the pacing and direction of it seemed really odd. It seems the creators wanted to fit too many ideas and plots into one movie to fill a time slot. The way the movie should feel slow paced only at the start before any build up, lasted for half of the movie. I think what most people were looking forward to was the real life/CGI moments near the end, and the build up to that didn't make much sense. They dropped the Bikini Bottom is up in flames story really quick just to finally introduce the out of water part. The lack of CGI time wouldn't have been such a bummer if the rest of the animated plot wasn't so poorly put together, it's like you're just waiting for the second half of the movie to kick in forever and ever. I thought the introduction of another pirate that wasn't the classic Patchy was rather.. odd? I see what they were trying to do with it, but it was still off. The reveal that he was the mastermind behind all the mess was a shock to me though, so they did write him in the way they intended to, I suppose.The one story arch (Plankton's redemption arc?) was an interesting concept however. I thought they paced out the relationship build up between he and Spongebob rather well. And while it did seem a little too out of character for Plankton at times, it was still a fun way to flesh him out, show him as a multi-dimensional character to some newer viewers that may not know all the easter eggs about him. It all coming together in the end when he goes back to his old ways in a cheeky way was a great note to end that off on. The part where Spongebob writes in superpowers for the crew is the best part of the movie, as expected and advertised. While very cheesy, was extremely cool to see (even if Spongebob's power was nothing special compared to the others.) Mr Krabs being a parody of Iron Man, intended or not, was brilliant! And the reveal of Sandy turning into an actual squirrel was *the* best thing in this movie. I was laughing so hard (too hard maybe?), it was so clever.Once you look past the advanced stuff like the painfully slow pacing, few bad jokes that didn't land, etc. It's good to watch. Kids will surely love it as it is a fun watch. I think any Spongebob fan, new or old can find enjoyment out of this movie.To follow up, I went and watched it a second time with a pal, took a lot less time analyzing the flaws and spent more time laughing about the ridiculous jokes together, good and bad. The first time watching it was disappointing, but if you go into it not expecting much, you can enjoy it a lot more."
" It's good but it doesn't feel like a theatrical movie
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,7,"SpongeBob SquarePants is one of my favorite television shows of all time. Most of the episodes are absolutely wonderful, and several of the jokes hit their marks. The first movie, for a long time, was the greatest movie I've ever seen, until Titanic trumped it a few years later. I never go to theaters so I didn't exactly see this movie on the big screen, and a few years after its release I watched it on the TV upstairs, and now I am able to give my honest opinion about it.This movie is not bad. It's not even mediocre. It's surprisingly really good. But the biggest problem about it is that it doesn't feel like it should be a theatrical film. It feels like an hour and a half long TV special rather than a movie. many people may disagree with me about this, but this barely even feels like a SpongeBob movie. I don't exactly know how to explain it. But that doesn't mean it's bad. Far from it. It's a good movie. The CGI seagulls were hilarious and the pirate also put on a great performance. And also how the main characters all got together to take down the big bad, even the main villain helped our heroes. The jokes mostly hit their mark and several of the scenes where chaos ensues are definitely very funny. But it just doesn't feel like a proper SpongeBob movie to me. Personally, SpongeBob should belong on TV instead of the movie theater. The biggest issue I have is actually the rap battle in the end. I personally think it should be CGI just like how the animals usually are. But otherwise, it's a good movie, with some noticeable flaws."
" Not too childish and mildly amusing
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,7,"This Spongebob Squarepants movie appears to be based on the popular television series. Having many fans worldwide, the show was due for its second theatrical release. Ones only to wonder why it took 11 years to release the sequel (the original being released in 2004). The plot of this film is quite rehashed but a little twist is what made it enjoyable and better. Director Paul Tibbitt delivers a fish- out-of-water, post-apocalyptic, buddy, road flick with a heavy sprinkle of time-travel. Turning Bikini Bottom into a Mad Max-style dystopia, where everyone wears leather, is just one of the gleefully silly highlights on offer here.Shown in the trailer are many scenes of the crew out-of-water in live 3D, though in the film that only occurs in the very end and it is not for too long. It is possible the best part of the film, although it feels somewhat different than the first half of the movie (where that feels more like an extended episode). Overall, this film is quite entertaining, fans of the series may enjoy it, and it isn't too long which may be a good thing."
" Stop bashing this movie
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,10,"This movie is really good it recreated the old show that we loved, hell Patrick said Finland when he got hurt that is a reference right there. The plot was good the only thing is that the cgi part wasn't there until the end other than that it was beautiful all the characters were fine and none of them were too mean or anything it was great!"
" A Fun Spngebob film to keep the fans happy
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,6,"I was a huge SpongeBob fan as a kid, and used to run home everyday to watch the program on television. SpongeBob has a special sense of humour that is at once immature and goofy, and high brow and interesting. The show has the ability to make both kids and adults laugh at the sly puns, the goofy visuals, and the ridiculous plots.So I was excited to see the Sponge Out of Water film. In a lot of ways, it did not disappoint. In this film, SpongeBob and Plankton need to team up to retrieve the Krusty Krab's secret formula after it mysteriously vanishes from Bikini Bottom. The town has collapsed into anarchy as the townspeople go mad from lack of Krabby Paddy's, and SpongeBob turns to Plankton to travel across the ocean, and throughout time itself, to try and bring the formula back to Bikini Bottom.This film features much of the same humour as the television program. The jokes are tongue in cheek good, and at times very clever. The visuals are striking, as they utilize both the television show look, and a more modern animation for SpongeBob and crew ""out of water."" The jokes often landed well, and I found myself chuckling a lot throughout the film. The story itself was passable, if bog standard, but it did truly feel like a regular episode of SpongeBob.However, a few negatives arose. I was not a fan of Antonio Banderas as the main pirate villain in the film. He played his part so over the top it reminded me of his Spy Kids roles. Some of the humour sunk like an anchor as well, and came off as annoying or just a miss. One example are the minor seagull characters, who generally serve no purpose besides to make silly noises, poop, fart, and so on. The humour from them was low brow, and that's saying something coming from a SpongeBob set.All in all though, The SpongeBob Movie: Fish Out of Water delivers an authentic SpongeBob Squarepants experience. Although it may not be his ""best episode"" it does have enough to offer to keep a Spongebob fan entertained. It is certainly a good fit for kids as well. A solid attempt and an entertaining film on the whole that will surely be enjoyable for old and new fans alike."
" A Solid Sequel
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"The Spongebob Squarepants Movie from 2004, in my opinion, is one of the best animated movies ever made. However, despite the films huge success, it took 10 years for the first trailer for the second movie. I found the trailer, and I couldn't wait! After 11 long years, Spongebob was finally coming back to the big screen! I went with all my friends, and thought it was solid.The Spongebob Movie: Sponge out of Water is a sequel that would bring the colorful world of Spongebob Squarepants to our world. The film was highly advertised as a animated/CGI hybrid film. This however, proved to be the biggest let down for the film. Whilst the trailers and posters advertised this as a Spongebob adventure on the surface, the film actually switches to the CGI route with 30 minutes left in the 90 minute movie. It is disappointing how only a third of the movie takes place on the surface, however, it is also nice to still see hand- drawn animated movies still being made.Now lets talk about the film. First, the characters. The characters from classic Spongebob are back. After 4 not-so-great seasons of the TV show, the characters that we know from the first movie are back. Most the comedy jokes hit, and some of the characters like Squidward and Sandy, were given much bigger roles in this movie. The new characters, Burger Beard and his seagull crew were hilarious additions. All the characters are great.Next up, the movie's plot. The plot of Sponge out of Water is that Burger Beard the pirate has stolen a magical book that allows him to steal the secret formula to the Krabby Patty. Bikini Bottom falls into an apocalyptic state, and Spongebob is forced to team up with Plankton. They build a time machine and try to steal back the formula before it disappeared. However, that plan fails. Then Spongebob, Patrick, Squidward, Sandy and Mr. Krabs, with help from Bubbles the dolphin, travel to the surface to get back the formula from Burger Beard. They harness the power of the magical book to become superheroes, and steal back the formula from Burger Beard. In all, the plot of this film is very weird, but very creative. As stated earlier, the final 30 minutes of the movie take place on the surface.In conclusion, The Spongebob Movie: Sponge out of Water is a solid sequel that is sure to continue the show's legacy. The characters are great, the comedy is good, and plot is creative and the animation is top-notch. When the CGI surface world scene begins, it is non-stop fun from beginning to end. If you're a fan pf the TV show, and/or the first movie, I recommend watching this movie as well. It is not perfect, but it is a lot of fun. The Spongebob Movie: Sponge out of Water, in my opinion, gets a 7/10!"
" mediocre but not as good as the first
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,6,"I personally think that the first sponge bob movie was better than the out of water one. I do enjoy a good sponge bob movie/show and yes it was good but i just thought it was a let down. As always it had good comedic jokes like all episodes but i think it could have been better. they should have included more characters. They really only used the OG characters (Spongebob, Patrick, sandy, Squidward, etc.) I would have enjoyed it more if like they even just had a small scene with Gary or misses puff in it. Overall i wouldn't say that i disliked it, again i would say it mediocre but i would choice the first one over this one any day of the week."
