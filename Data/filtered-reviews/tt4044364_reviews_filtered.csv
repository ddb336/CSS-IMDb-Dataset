" Wake up
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,9,"And listen to this story. Hero or traitor it's your view, the story should be shared and that is the point."
" ""This movie stresses out the story rather than the person""
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,"Well anticipated movie ever since the documentary maker was a part of the team that assured the NSA information leaked by Edward Snowden made it safe to the public. This movie stresses out the story rather than the person, but it seems hard to differentiate the two in some ways : it's still feels rather like a movie about the history of this information leak about government spying on their people, and the american one spying on everybody and the pressure the journalists received in order to try to keep them quiet rather than one on Ed Snowden, there's is no background story on his childhood, or interviews of his parents for example. This movie is on the list of mainstreamly accessible documentary that could be use to explain exactly how parano√Øa has every reason not to be considered a psychological condition anymore. also, it just got the oscar for best documentary if you care about that sort of things."
" He's a hero.
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,9,I watched the movie Snowden (2016) and wanted to learn more about the actual events. Surprisingly it wasn't far off and this documentary was still very informative. I can't believe this man is considered a traitor by our government for telling the truth. He should be home without worry of repercussions. Watch this documentary!!!
" Boring for outside US audiences
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,1,"A US state sponsored data snooping documentary after 2002 terror attack, that's all"
" A Humane Look into the Person Behind the Story of a Most Serious and Controversial Event in World History
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,10,"Citizenfour offers a humane look into the person behind the serious and controversial leaks of top-secret private governmental secrets around the globe. The film serves as a statement to the tensions inherent between freedom of speech and national security, at least as conceptualized in the modern age by the world most powerful governments. All of it, seen through the eyes of Snowden, the documentarian, and some journalists. Citizenfour runs as a political and investigative thriller, cerebral at times, yet mostly informative, surprising, and revealing. And all done with an attention to process, to time and to space, and to the way things unfolded for Snowden and the journalists involved. An achievement in story-telling and for its journalistic portrayals of an intense and serious period."
" Epic
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,10,"Edward Snowden is a true hero who sacrificed everything so that he could inform the world of the government's warrantless surveillance of every U.S. citizen. This documentary perfectly captures that sacrifice in an intriguing way that will hook the people watching. It's unforgettable.
I am so amazed and belittled to compare myself to these brave whistle blowers, and their strength of character...Edward, Laura and Glenn. Must add to it that the cinematic language, under such stressful circumstances, is so perfect...it captures the mood of the story (the reality actually) absolutely and makes one realize just how threatening it all is getting on to be....!"
" Kevin Fabian Debate
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,10,"CitizenfourEdward Snowden: The brave man who took whatever it took to expose the truth about the NSA. To tell people that they were being spied on by the government. He was a soldier until suffering an injury. A very young smart man who had the guts to go leave his country for good and never return for the greater good of the people. Some people might say ""he shouldn't have done that"" some people see him as a hero. Although we live in this country there is so little that we really know about big red, white, blue America. We see it as the greatest nation because that is what we are told through media, movies, politics, school and more. We are puppets whose puppeteers are three branches of government. Government keeps control. Well we are being controlled. I see a lot of ""The land of the free and brave"" when we are all being played like an old vinyl. We need to wake up and see what is really happening to us.
In the documentary called ""Citizenfour"" we are shown the strength of the mind of the whistleblower Edward Snowden. We can see in the documentary the carefully thought out plan in order to expose the United States for their unjust practices in invading people's lives and information. What they did was wrong. Let's say facebook. If someone on facebook did something wrong. Their friends, friends,friends,friends,friends and lets say you are in the 5th connection down the line you are attached to the crime they committed so now your life can be searched and intruded into. This is completely wrong. This reminds me about Martin Luther King on how although he went against the norm on his government. It was for the greater good so he took one for the people."
" it Took Smedley Butler 40 years to Learn what Cit4 knows
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,1,"Having just skimmed Snowdens' book Permanant Record, I realized that over and over again in my head, I go back to the Cit4 documentary. IMHO the silent majorarity in America and American wannabees are ""Pretending to be Asleep"" to the facts adn become the hardest to wake up. Time to get out of Brazil Glen? I wanted to give this 12 stars but I never read those first so sorry for the trickery....did it work? pass it on. L di RC"
" A very personal look into Edward Snowden's contact to journalist Glenn Greenwald and more
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,9,"The main focus is on Edward Snowden revealing his information about NSA methods to journalist Glenn Greenwald and others in a hotel room in China. It's a very personal look into how this period of time was for him. How he sacrificed his old life and his safety to get these things published. There are scenes where he is watching the News on TV about him and his revelations, sitting on his bed with a laptop barefoot in a bathrobe, getting dark eye circles because he couldn't leave the hotel eversince the public knew his face. We get to know 29 years old Edward Snowden a lot better by watching 'Citizenfour'.There's more background information and other locations, e.g. public speeches of Barrack Obama, William Binney or the german parliament. The cinematography isn't always high end. Still a great documentary of this part of modern history and I am glad I got to see it."
" Must watch.
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,10,"When reality overpass imagination... thanks Edward, this man has giant balls"
" Incredible! Incredible!
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,10,This documentary is mind blowing. Shows the depth of Edward Snowden's sacrifice for the well being of people's freedom. Really moved me.
" Tremendous
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,10,This man sacrificed so much for everyone. How we see people in power has changed our views because of Snowden and the filmmaker has done a great job of telling his story.
" Good Content, But Poorly Executed
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,8,"The documentary was interesting and somewhat shocking, which is good for me, but I think the way the information was conveyed will be hard for most people to understand. Also, there are a lot of pointless scenes that seem like pure filler and character building moments. This isn't a movie, it's a documentary, Laura Poitras.Speaking of Laura Poitras, it was incredibly annoying and a little confusing that she never introduced herself during the film and insisted on narrating it in first person, anyway. Still, pretty good for someone who's never directed a documentary before, if that is the case. I'm assuming it is bc that's what the evidence suggests."
" Old News
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,5,"While it is initially interesting to see how the main players of the story were brought together by Snowden's efforts, it quickly becomes something not all that dissimilar to a classroom lecture, as we listen to Snowden explain everything from his hotel room. Not to devalue the incredibly relevant information he's relaying, but at this point so much of it is old news, and, frankly, it's just not executed in a way that keeps it interesting. I suppose it is interesting to get to know Snowden a bit more, but it mostly feels like the filmmakers didn't have all that much to work with besides that bedroom interview."
" Over-rated (yes, I know this makes me an outlier)
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,6,"The subject of this documentary is Edward Snowden and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) spy scandals that were exposed in 2013.This film is like a mystery being unfolded even if we know the outcome. What adds to the tension is that many one of us are potentially part of this drama: the NSA was found to have collected data from private conversations exchanged by telephone and computers in the U.S. and in other countries. ""Citizenfour"" also reveals information that is difficult for the many who had hoped that a Barack Obama presidency was going to be much better than that of George W. Bush.The subject alone should make this film mandatory viewing. Sadly, the style of the film is dull for various reasons.Much of it is in talking-head style, keeping the camera almost constantly on Snowden as he exposes government secrets. Snowden is heroic in what he has done but he is not able to sustain full audience attention during his interviews. Few people could achieve such a task although investigative reporter Glenn Greenwald (another contributor to this film) seems to have more camera-savvy.Another problem is that most of the information given is from technical experts speaking on subjects such as data encryption and devices. For most viewers, this level of detail is difficult to follow.""Citizenfour"" might have benefited by using similar techniques used in ""Inside Job"" (2010), another documentary that dealt with complex information that affected most citizens - how corporate America ripped off average citizens leading to the financial crisis of 2008. ""Inside Job"" took occasional time away from interviews to break down the complex information to make it more understandable to average viewers. Such a technique would have made ""Citizenfour"" more effective."
" Incredible
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,10,Incredible journalism packed into a great documentary film. Everyone needs to watch this.
" Whistle-blowers are the true heroes of our time
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,10,"""We are building the biggest weapon for oppression in the history of mankind."" Edward SnowdenIn January of 2013 documentary film director and producer Laura Poitras received an encrypted e-mail from a stranger who called himself Citizen Four, who offered to provide insider information about illegal wiretapping practices of the US National Security Agency (NSA) and other intelligence agencies. A few months later, along with two journalists, she went to Hong Kong and met with now famous Eduard Snowden.The documents that Snowden disclosed reveal organized control over the entire world telecommunications conducted by US ""Intelligence Community"" in conjunction with the US Government and with cooperation of the largest information and telecommunications corporations.This documentary doesn't contain new details about NSA covert operations or information about their plans. Everything said here is already known to all who have followed this case in the media. Nevertheless, Citizenfour is extremely powerfully historical document that recorded argumentation and thought process of one of the most significant whistle-blowers of our time. This is the key importance of the Citizenfour. Here, we see Snowden as an intelligent young man, rational, precise in thought and expression, very articulate and most importantly, courageous, ethical and highly motivated. Its not coincidence that Eduard Snowden is often compared with the case of analyst Daniel Ellsberg who in 1971 handed a large internal secret Pentagon report on the war in Vietnam to the press.A man who, guided by ethical principles, decides to risk everything he has and takes a step into the unknown deserves to be hailed as a hero. Without exaggeration, we can say that whistle-blowers who are giving to the public evidences of abuses and crimes of the state and corporations are the true heroes of our time.Another impression is also very strong - that of loathing we feel in front of blatant media lies of state representatives and bureaucrats of intelligence organizations. Today, this 1000 times repeated lie didn't become the truth - it remained a lie, and those behind it are continuing to be liars. We fully understand that the world system in we live in has absolutely no legitimacy, and is primarily maintained by the bare force and fear of that force. Strongest feeling that remains after watching this film is the anxiety about the direction in which the world is going and the hope that the possibility to change that route still exists. It is not the question of the nature of the society we live in. We know it, we understand it. The real question is - what kind of society do we want to live in? And, what we are willing to do to make that society happen?I'd also recommend that after seeing Citizenfour you watch the talk by Laura Poitras and Jacob Appelbaum ""Reconstructing narratives - transparency in the service of justice"" and Appelbaum's lecture on the militarization of the Internet ""To Protect And Infect""."
" Amazing
",2018-04-11 00:00:00,9,Shows real behind the scenes footage and is very suspenseful and enlightening
" Thought-provoking, no matter your take
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,7,"Parts of this film felt oddly personality-driven: How will Edward Snowden dress today? What are his facial expressions while watching the news? But really it is an exploration of what we're willing to sacrifice for our principles...and for our freedoms. For all its faults, watching this story unfold in real time is compelling and worthwhile."
" Impressive documentary
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,9,"Edward Snowdon's interview at the Mira Hotel in Hong Kong was very bold, and I can imagine how would have felt whenever someone knocked on the door announcing room service. I know it's a trope in many spy/cop/detective shows, and thankfully Snowdon managed to make a run for it, or else the Oliver Stone movie later on would have taken a different direction."
" No matter if you think Edward Snowden is a heroic whistle-blower or evil traitor. This documentary is worth spying on.
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"Nobody likes being spy on. If you do, then there is something wrong with you. For some of us, hearing the news that the US government has been spying on its citizens in the Americas and its allies for years from an ex-National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, is shocking and disturbing. For others, it was not that surprising, seeing how many have lived under the fear of government infiltration since the days where the Patriot Act was created in 2001. For me, while, the documentary didn't bring much of anything new to the table, that I haven't known for years, because of William Binney, Chelsea Manning, Wikileaks, Anonymous, and other underground websites. I thought, no matter what, Snowden's actions on June 2013 did make big news around the world, as it spark a sense of public awareness of the illegal wiretapping practices of the NSA and other intelligence agencies. This documentary really does captured those moments, with the black computer coded texting narrative in the beginning, and how director Laura Poitras, along with investigative journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewan MacAskill of 'the Guardian', a British newspaper, agree to meet with Edward Snowden AKA ""Citizenfour"" in a Hong Kong hotel room in order to spill the beans. While, it perfectly capture the paranoia days before, during and after Snowden's revelations became the world's top news story with intense scenes of suspicious 'hot mic' phones calls, weird arrivals of repairs vans and downright disturbing coincidence like a fire alarm going off, while the group is in the hotel for over eight days to discuss the data and how best to reveal it to the world, and the repercussions of doing so. A bit, of me, thinks, some of it was a bit played off, for dramatic effects. After all, the NSA didn't know for days, who did it, until Snowden put out his name out, there. Plus, it took the US government, a few more weeks to finally requests the Hong Kong government extradite Snowden. So, in short, I don't think, Snowden was in danger, as the film portray, he was. Added to that, the film does feel a bit one-sided to the point, that certain shots, seem staged, like the ripping of the papers, and the close up of author Cory Doctorow's novel 'Homeland', which focus on a technologically clued-in young person, fighting back against the tyrannical security state. It didn't felt like real raw footage. It felt theatrics and an bit propaganda. Another problem with the film is that, it didn't feature much of 'Washington Post' journalist, Barton Gellman's coverage of the U.S. National Security Agency. He too, was provided with top secret documents by Snowden like the 'Black Budget' file. I would love to see, his story, showcase as well. Furthermore, the disclosures made by other publications including 'Der Spiegel' and 'The New York Times' should also be explore. Another problem for the film is, the fact that it didn't explain much in layman's terms, the majority of the vast hundreds of pages of classified NSA documents that he was giving to the public, such as examples, 'Tempora' 'Blackpearl' and 'Xkeyscore'. Because of that, some people couldn't comprehend, what they were seeing on screen. There was one scene that really bug me, in which Snowden felt compelled to put a blanket over his head, while typing on a laptop. I think, he was blocking his face from the laptop webcam as NSA is known to spy through there, but I wish the movie was a little more, clear with that. I also wish the movie used more visuals numbers, charts, and graphs as it is the only thing, that I can think, could had made people understand how much government was intruding on our privacies. Even with visuals, some narrative was needed, as images such as ""Google Cloud Exploitation"" from NSA MUSCULAR program was hard to understanding. Another problem is that, it didn't follow up, with later leaks by Snowden being put out there, such as 'MonsterMind' & 'Turbine'. Despite that, this documentary indeed shows some of the dark side of where society is heading into the digital age. It did shows the extent to which the U.S. and other governments seek to punish Snowden, Poitras, and Greenwald for their shocking revealed, weeks later. However, it fell to mention the problems in details, when Snowden try to get asylum, such as the infamous Evo Morales grounding incident, or the reasons, why Snowden is trapped in Russia. Despite that, I just surprised, this movie was even released, seeing how the director had to flee to Germany from Hong Kong, in order to edit the film, before the FBI shown up with a search warrant for her hard drives. I guess, the government later decide, that there was no way to stop the film from coming out, so they let it go, and move on, to tightening their own security. Regardless of the so-calls, threats, Poitras was able to release the documentary to the public in late 2014. In my opinion, the world is better, because of it. Overall: This documentary really does deserve the Academy Award win for Best Documentary, that year, despite some flaws, as it show exciting investigative journalism. It's a must watch for sure."
" gibberish - read about the subject matter and then watch
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,2,"This is an exploitation movie designed to spin a tale about the big bad brother watching everyone and working in nefarious ways. I don't think the story is made up but the tale is told in a way to prey on conspiracy theorists and anti-government anything and ""gee I didn't know that"" type. There is no balanced perspective. First, bamford has been writing about the nsa for I think 20 years and in his latest book he gives many details about programs that are supposed to be revelations in this movie by the prophet snowden. His book came out long before snowden so how is any of this relevant? How can so-called respected journalists and filmmakers not acknowledge that the nsa has been monitoring traffic, including US communication for some time and it's been common knowledge. Here's another shocker, we spy on our allies; put me in a movie. And why does snowden publicly put himself out into the media yet claim he doesn't want the attention? This movie is about him. The story has always been about snowden. It's claimed in the movie that he wants to be the target so his previous colleagues aren't harassed. That's extremely naive. Anyone who knows anything about computers and security should know that he could easily have left behind clues for investigators to find. And, despite his claims it's pretty naive to assume that they wouldn't go after other employees. I'm sure a lot of people were put thru a lot of lie detector tests and probably hundreds of non-disclosure documents were signed and each one came with a severe threat. If you've ever worked in the intelligence business then you know the govt can be very anal about security and I'm sure this movie has puckered things up to the extreme. I've met a lot of really smart people in IT and security and snowden comes off as a pretty insignificant twit talking with very gullible and ignorant media types. The cloak and dagger stuff at the beginning is laughable, and the bit about keys and hiding passwords is nothing but hogwash. Put things in perspective. Google is not the first search engine but it has evolved to be the one that most people use and it's an amazing tool. Nobody pays for this service so how do they make so much, much, much money? They make their money by data hawking which has been around since almost when modern computers were invented in the 50s. They sell data about you to advertisers and they sell to businesses to get search results to favor them. Facebook does the same thing. There are many large data repository companies that work in conjunction with companies like google to build market data. All these companies combine ore about you than anyone including the nsa and any other agency you can think of. When you are on the internet they are constantly collecting information about you. More and more now this data is being used against individuals. For example, if you're unfortunate to get yourself on the news, media agencies go to these companies to find information about you which all sorts of information like any arrest record, police reports, banking information, your kids and their birth dates and names. Information that is private is collected all the time from govt agencies and then sold. For example, if you have an arrest warrant, in almost all parts of the country that record (by city, county, state or fed) is private yet I guarantee that I can find a company that can pull up your record. I suspect it is true as bamford writes in his book that the govt has been twisting the arm of companies like google to get access to theirrecords but you're pretty ignorant if you think they have anything on the big data repository companies. And the idea that anyone at the nsa can tie into your laptop and spy on you is laughable. If you are that paranoid, it's time to see a psychiatrist. This documentary preys on that paranoia and tries to hype and hawk it which is irresponsible but typical of the media today."
