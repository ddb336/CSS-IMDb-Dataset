" This was excellent!
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,9,"Mads is so damn good. The old west was brutal and this movie really made me angry. I was so pist off for Mads I wanted to see him murder the whole damn world! This is such a good western story. Everyone plays there parts magnificently. Best Western I've seen since ""Bone Tomahawk""."
" Worth watching twice
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,8,"I just rented this film thinking I hadn't seen it before. A minute into watching the film I remembered I'd already seen it.Fortunately I also remembered it was really quite good. That's basically my review of film. Basically a revenge western with some solid actors/actresses acting well. I would recommend this film, it's a very good version of that. If you like that sort of film."
" classic revenge western
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this. Bleak, tense, satisfying. Also interesting that three of the actors were all in Bond films as villains or girls."
" Sweet Revenge
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,8,"As few westerns are made in today's age of filmmaking, it always feels like a relatively simple genre to succeed with. Start with a few interesting characters, add a bit of tension, shocking deaths, and mix in some revenge. That's generally the formula for a great western. The Salvation has all of that and more.8.3/10"
" A really violent and nail-biting Western with emotion , thrills , chills , shoot'em up and grisly killings
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,7,"Out of wreckage of the Danish defeat in the war of 1864 , Jon abd his brother crossed the Atlantic to forge a new future for themselves . For seven years , they struggled to get a foothold in an unifamiliar land . Seven years in which Jon longed for his wife, Maria, and their son. Seven years of a family apart . Set in a new country : America 1870 , an European settler : Mads Mikkelsen , reunites his family : wife and child , going a find to his brother : Mikael Persbrandt , at the local ranch .

Later on , he seeks for revenge , but the brother called Delarue : Jeffrey Dean Morgan, of one bandit wants vengeance against the settler who murdered him . Bad Men Will Bleed .A twilight and furious Western with a lot of violence , pursuits , thrills , noisy action and spectacular showdown . This thrilling picture develops the traditional issue of Spaghetti Western : a relentless and mutual revenge . As there are two merciless vendettas , the first in which our starring tries to avenge the death of his family , and the second in which a ruthless local baron attempts to revenge death of his brother . There is also the usual cowardice and fear of the members of a small community that betray him and force two two brothers protagonists to hunt down enemies alone . Here stands out a great cast giving awesome interpretation , such as : Mads Mikkelsen as the brave and avenger hero, Mikael Persbrandt as his valiant brother , Eva Greene as the mute mistreated herorine , Douglas Henshall as town priest/sheriff , Jonathan Pryce as a coward undertaker and the baddie Jeffrey Dean Morgan repeating an extremely villain role like in Walking Dead .Special mention for the colorful and evocative cinematography by Janes Schlosser. Though no shot in USA , but in Cullinan, Gauteng , Johannesburg, Sout Africa. As well as moving and exciting musical score by Winding . Kristian Levring writes the interesting script along with Thomas Jensen. Theis Danish picture was compellingly directed by Kristian Levring . Here Levring leaves his ""85 Dogma manifest"", as he was one of the fourth founders along with Lars Von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg and Soren Kragh-Jacobsen , by making a classic and violent Western about a lonely antihero seeking for vengeance . Rating 7/10. Above average ."
" The Purgatory
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,4,"The Salvation really drew me in purely on the cast. Mikkelsen, Green and Morgan all together in a gritty western? Uh, yes please.Then I watched it.Green is an exceptional, unique and intense actress and they made her mute. Mute! Come on! Yeah, she can convey a lot just with her eyes but still. The movie also has this weird filter over out that really bugged me.Oh, and the acting. Out there leads are great but then there's everyone else. There was a moment when someone was shooting, they ran out of bullets, the gun made obvious, empty clicks but the actor just kept on firing with awkward intensity. This effects and acting flub was a prime example of wild inconsistencies and deficits between the leads and everyone else.This was super frustrating. The big three here are as good as they can be, considering how some of them are hindered but everything else is really underwhelming frustrating. Fans of the three should give it a shot just set expectations accordingly. Everyone else should find something different to watch."
" Looks familiar
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,8,"Its a really good western. Morgan is Henry Fonda, though I have heard him compared to Elam, but I say Fonda straight from once upon a time in the west. Mads pulls it off so well. And where has the brother been hiding all my life? Gorgeous, and he reminds me of another gorgeous cowboy though sadly long dead - William C Watson. They pulled this movie off very well. Its a shame the box office thought otherwise personally I thought it was good and dad would have loved it. Shame it took me till now to find it. Also, Langley's brief intro at the end was nice but way too short! I forgot how much he reminds me of Dierkop."
" Great western
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,8,If you like Westerns I highly recommend. Much better than its 6.8!rating. Good plot. Well acted Cinematography beautiful. Ticks all the Western boxes. Loved it.
" The best music choice for a western!
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,8,"""The Salvation"" is a good movie. It isn't one of the best western-themed movies, but it could be easily considered one of the best mediocre western movies. There are some good elements which makes this movie a good one, like the soundtrack, which was carefully chosen and the degree of realism involving the shootings. The picture is also a good advantage, and the overall atmosphere.
What I didn't like and what I think that this movie lacks, is the complexity of the plot, because the movie, just from the beginning is very predictable. Apart of that, the movie is like I already said, good enough."

" Stunning
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,10,"Even Cantonna is excellent, well written good script and well paced"
" It's a good attempt at trying to revive a dying, classic genre, and for western fans like me, this could be an enjoyable treat!
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,6,"A Danish western filmed in South Africa, sounds like a new form of spaghetti western right? For a modern day western, The Salvation is a decent pic, but I didn't find it flawless. The character development is too thin, and the main lead act by Mads Mikkelsen is memorable but there isn't enough emotion to it, I found. It is gritty, but not as violent and gory as it claims itself to be as well, which is disappointing."
" Refreshing suprise
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,10,"A straight to the point western. No slow build up, no filler scenes, no clich√©s and no awkwardly cringy moments. This movie dives straight into the story and somehow manages to make you feel for the character fast and with intensity, in a way that most modern movies fail even with their backstory style elongated build ups.The three main actors do a fantastic job, Mags as always oozes the pain his character is feeling, Jeffrey shows us all exactly why he was perfect to become Negan (sorry but I had to wedge that in there) and Eva manages to steal the screen when without uttering a single word.Refreshing change finding this gem amongst the mostly awful movie list I'm working my way through."
" Viewers Will Be Drawn Into This Exceptional Old Western Movie Immediately Featuring Mads Mikkelsen
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,10,"This movie has a realistic storyline that's played out with the best of the best professional actors. Viewer immersion into the storyline is guaranteed. I absolutely love this movie and this makes about the fifth time that I've watched it. A must watch movie that will very soon become a classic.

" Mads out for revenge! Look Out!
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,8,"382. The Salvation. A bad-ass western featuring Mads Mikkelsen! Jon Jensen has been waiting for his wife and son to make their way to America during the 1870s. Jon has been there for a while building a life. And on the very day they arrive, they are murdered. Jon takes swift action and violently kills these two pieces of doo-doo. Unfortunately, one of those pieces of doo-doo has a big brother named Henry that pretty much runs the town through fear and taxes. So when Henry hears of his brothers murder, he wants his own revenge. And sure they go out and find Jon pretty easily and take him in. They quickly realize that a man with nothing to lose, is gonna fight back! Like I said Mads is awesome! Jeffrey Dean Morgan is great as the bad guy Henry. And Eva Green, sure she doesn't say one word in the movie, is freaking great! Like Westerns? This is one to check out!! Filmbufftim on FB!"
" A modern day spaghetti Western - in a good way
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,8,A good Western that throws you off track regularly as it develops its characters just well enough for you to miss them when they are gone. The end is in keeping if a tad expected. Its a good gritty story that's worth watching.
" Lazy writing and poor direction
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,3,"Plague this attempt at a western. the incredibly talented performers make this tolerable, but it's upsetting that they would use such cheap tricks to steal your feels rather than earning them through good writing and performance. every single time this movie attempts to make you feel anything, they steal plots points and on occasion scene for scene from some of the most notorious Charles Bronson movies. watching this illicits countless eye rolls, just cheesy but unintentional, fake and old hollywood but in a bad way. it did however remind me how good SILVERADO is, and DEADWOOD, and HELL ON WHEELS... now those have impeccable writing and direction, performers and performances... gritty... real... they work really hard for your feels and they make you give em up at gun point! this movie is 100% worth a watch... but will never be on anyone's 'Top 100 westerns' lists ever. shame... coulda been"
" Old School Western!!
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,8,"This is a great movie with some very interesting characters and a simple but relatable story about a man's vengeance.
The 90 minute running is perfect for this movie and the story never drags.
Its a very good movie about a good man versus evil men and while that sounds pretty dull its actually a really well made movie with a good cast.
Mads Mikkelsen is a great as the lead actor and you can totally relate to him.
Jeffrey Dean Morgan is great as the movies villain and has surprisingly Eric Cantona(the footbal legend) as his second in command.
Further roles from the always great Eva Green, Douglas Henshall and Jonathan Pryce and you have a very entertaining well made movie.
Should defenitely be in every movie collection.
A well deserved 8/10 for me...... Loved itüòäüëç"
" Violent western.
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,5,"Violent and brutal, this movie showcases all the worst parts of the western genre. It's really just an unforgiving bloodbath that happens without leaving you satisfied at all. Mads plays a great gunslinger after his family is killed- but appears to have minimal talent until then. The entire film could have been prevented if he'd just pulled the trigger instead of giving the bad guys and out. I mean come on, how often is big bad in the crosshairs and he gets time to think about it? Classic movie failure. Eva Green literally doesn't say a word nor does she do much of anything besides hold screen time to fill the movie. Jeff Morgan plays a POS bad guy that no one likes, he does it here as he's always done- nothing big nothing worth appreciating, just someone you can hate. It's a western, what can I say? ""Slow West"" is far superior if you're looking for a modern western."
" Candidate for greatest western of the twenty-first century
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,10,"The Salvation is a Danish western and while this might sound surprising at first sight, The Salvation is easily the best western I have seen in many years and a solid candidate for western of the decade or even of the century. The story revolves around a quiet Danish farmer named Jon Jensen who welcomes his wife and son in the United States of America after years of separation. On the night of their arrival, the peaceful farmer gets savagely beaten up by two thugs. They then proceed to rape his wife in front of their son before killing both of them. Jon Jensen takes his revenge but soon learns that one of the criminals was the brother of an influential local land baron who now plans to kill Jon Jensen. Since the local land baron controls the town and people close to Jon Jensen, he can only rely on his brother and needs to be extremely careful to survive. It soon becomes obvious that either the local land baron or the Danish farmer has to die to end the conflict.There are numerous elements that make this movie great. The story is very emotional and gritty but always remains realistic and easy to follow. The settings look absolutely splendid and especially the dirty oil town where the land baron lives with his thugs looks memorable. The camera work is detailed, epic and precise. The atmospheric soundtrack enhances the movie's sinister atmosphere. The action scenes are authentic, gripping and tough. The movie doesn't overuse special effects and goes back to the stylistics of classic westerns from the sixties. The acting performances are absolutely splendid. Mads Mikkelsen who incarnates the quiet protagonist underlines once more that he is one of the greatest contemporary actors. Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays a charismatic antagonist who really incarnates everything you might dislike about another person. Eva Green plays a silent femme fatale whose intentions aren't always clear and whose development throughout the movie is truly intriguing.I have thought long and hard about negative sides of this movie but there simply aren't any. This western is enjoyable from start to finish, not only for western fans but for anyone who likes excellent cinema with vibrant action scenes, intense atmosphere and interesting characters. The Salvation proves that the western genre isn't gone and forgotten yet but can still be entertaining and vibrant in the twenty-first century without denying its roots and style."
" Very unique. Very dark tone.
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,8,"This was one if the most unique westerns I've seen. It's a very small scale, and sort of same revenge plot that's been done before. But this is told in a very different way. Very little dialogue, very surreal setting, and kind of a cold protagonist. I thoroughly enjoyed this."
" Diet Western
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,5,"I really don't like Jeffery Dean Morgan in this or really in anything. He never adds anything to the character and sometimes makes a film much worse. Like this isn't a great film, the pacing is off, none of the characters are clearly defined BUT if this film had had a decent villain it might have risen slightly above mundane. Mads is great as always but really all of the actors here just looked like they were watching someone mow their lawn. Dumb story, some great Mads scenes, some terrible Jeffery Dean Morgan scenes. Mostly just a ripoff"
" Elegant characters killed by terrible film shooting
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,3,"Very nice visual effects, warm background music and golden movie stars with charming flavours.
However, as much as I was so excited watching this movie, the second half of it just killed it! as the avenging scenes shootings were awfully designed which didn't suit minimal expectations! , the action music was like someone flinching whilst asleep! the speech at prison was like a child swearing a story. Such great actors do not deserve been thrown into such scenarios"
" Mads M.
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,6,The story is so simple that you can understand what will happen next...Mads Mikkelsen and Eva Green are superior as usual...
" Slides downhill throughout..
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,5,"Here's a movie that just gets worse and worse, I'll just list things that will give you a rough idea.1) It felt fake, the sets, the costumes, the camera angles, the direction, (some of the casting, some of the acting) it felt like a movie, and it was for these reasons that I just couldn't get into it. Go and watch a movie like 'The Proposition' and look at how hard they went into making the costumes by hand, and dirtying up the sets to the point of realism, with a fantastic soundtrack / camera operation / editing / cinematography / directing. Compare it to this and you'll realise just how stale this movie really is. The sets felt like they were made of clean plywood that were built last week, nothing felt aged, it was very disappointing.2) Eric Cantona... As much as I loved the guy during his football career, he completely breaks the fourth wall, it's like this constant reminder that what you are watching is completely fake, and it doesn't allow you to really get into the movie once you lay eyes on him. It felt like someone behind the scenes was doing him some sort of favour and they had to sell out their standards to repay it.3) Eva Green... She seemed like she was playing the role of a gothic witch of some sort, she felt completely out of place in the movie, and with the budget constraints that the movie constantly stunk of, it had me wondering the entire time, ""why not just cast a woman who doesn't cost half a million - 1 million (or more) especially if she doesn't even have to speak a line throughout the entire film"" my guess is you'd have a thousand pretty women that fit the profile, and would literally work for nothing for the opportunity to be in a film, and I reckon they all could have done a better job than Eva Green, who has facial expressions and characteristics that only feel at home in a kids film.4) Nightime scenes shot in daylight and then edited to look dark. Urgh.5) Soundtrack was a forgetful mess, all the music sounded like a song you've heard before and then changes into something else, it's asif they needed a jumping off point for every song in the movie, by using the beginning of better more successful songs from the past.SPOILERS BELOW, SPOILERS BELOW.6) What happened to the kid in the end, there was no clarification, it's asif the director/editor completely forgot to tie his character off. Not only that but the last interaction we see between him and 'Mads' is when he's telling him he can't come yet in the next scene, they're double teaming the enemy quarters, it's so stupid, watch that scene again and tell me I'm wrong.Look, this films a cheap mess, the only reason it's got a 5/10 is because I'm very lenient, and also the stage coach scene, the offering up of town citizens scene and the prison break scene were all very enjoyable, also I'm a big fan of Mads Mikkelsen, it's a shame that all else surrounding the movie, bars Mads and them select scenes was a disaster."
" One note evil guys make for a depressing movie
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,3,"Mads Mikkelsen is an extremely talented actor. He does not deliver a single false note here. The main problem with this movie is the extreme characterization of the ""bad"" guys. They are not nuanced. There are no shades in their character. They are just evil to the extreme. This results in the other main problem with this movie which is that the movie is predictable. The third thing wrong with this movie is it is just plain depressing."
" The Best Old Western Movie Since ""UNFORGIVEN"" With Mads Mikkelsen - 10 Stars
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,10,"01/09/2019 This exceptional movie hooks the viewer almost immediately. Viewer Immersion into the realistic storyline is guaranteed. I absolutely love this movie (much as I do with Clint Eastwood in ""UNFORGIVEN"") and have watched this movie at least 4 time? (Unforgiven - alot more than a dozen). The actors, especially Mads Mikkelsen (never in a bad movie) are perfection, the storyline? - engaging/wonderful ...... A really great movie soon to be a Classic. Bon Appetit"
" New western classic
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,9,"The director created a believable and dark western about the harsh life and he set the tone perfect within the first sequence. The cinematography, soundtrack and all the sound effects were just perfect, the acting from Mads Mikkelsen and Jeffrey Dean Morgan stands out the most as their portrayals feel so alive and the performances are great, Mikkelsen's best performance to date.The action sequences were entertaining and thought out, choreography was spot on."
" Wasted talent
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,4,"Mads Mikkelsen stars as a Danish immigrant to the Old West avenging the deaths of family members. Eva Green plays The Girl.Like so many films nowadays, the plot is really just an excuse to showcase all kinds of murderous violence. The good guys are pure of heart, the bad guys are evil incarnate, and there's not a single unpredictable moment. Excellent acting, cinematography and so forth can't make up for the emptiness at the heart of it.All in all: A well done film that wasn't worth doing in the first place."
" Delivers the goods.
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,7,"This is a beautifully shot, well-acted, straightforward western. It's gritty, cynical, and violent, but it also offers a measure of stoicism and bravery. Costumes and sets are gorgeous. If its plot has a few missteps, the execution is so confident you hardly notice. Good movie."
" Just Average Modern Western
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,6,I don't like when films set in the old American West are filmed outside the American West. That's the weakest part of this whole thing for me. It's an OK movie.
" Spagetty western in Danish remoulade
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,6,"This is a typical punishment and revenge movie. It starts very well with the tension building up and the events unfolding in the stagecoach and aftermath. Then, it sort of turns into a caricature of a western at the moment the colonel starts killing innocent town people wantonly. That plot may suit well to story in a Nazi concentration camp but becomes believable nowhere else including the wild West. His act is totally irrational because no one would like to create enemies out of nowhere. The pretext that colonel wanted to scare people to sell their lands cheap for the black gold also looks shaky because only after the discovery of ICE and its common use in the early 20th century, a huge demand grew for the petroleum. The one dimensional pure evil characterization of the colonel takes a lot from the movie. In Unforgiven, for example, the Sheriff acted by Gene Hackman has a much deeper character. Besides that, the cast and acting are very good. M. Mikkelsen certainly stands out in his lead acting role. The landscape scenes are beautifully shot. From start to the end, the movie never loses its pace and the length is good."
" Sequel required!
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,8,"Although far from being a masterpiece, The Salvation is a good movie in its genre. Besides that I would have preferred a more convincing villain, more realistic flames and fires and not an ever present sepia tone on all the shots, there are plenty of positive aspects. Actors did a good job, especially Mikkelsen and Green, the cinematography was marvelous, the plot was somehow of a cat and mouse game but enough to keep the tense mood for watcher. Thumbs up for a good western movie!"
" Fans of the genre will not be disappointed!

" Art Film quality ""wild west"" portrait of evil
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,10,"The best first thing you can say about this flick is that it's good old, down-home, operatic storytelling and character development.After that, it's icing on the cake. The production values are fantastic, and the direction and acting is spot-on.If you find western revenge dramas to be your thing, definitely check this one out."

Things don't work out and Jon becomes a vigilante force in a western version of ""Walking Tall."" Eva Green is in the film, but has no speaking lines. The bad guy wears a black hat. Plenty of killing. I found the film to be formula and the dead pan character of Jon plus the quiet Eva Green made the dialogue thing a joke.Guide: No F-bombs or nudity (Congrats Eva Green on getting a role where you keep on your clothes.

" Impressive for a low-budget Western
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,7,"'The Salvation' turned out to be much better than I was expecting. This is an old-school revenge Western with modern elements that has the feeling of a big budget production. Everything from the acting to the cinematography feels top level and very polished. Mads Mikkelsen is convincing in the lead and Eva Green gives a compelling performance as the silent Madelaine.The plot is interesting enough to hold your attention throughout and the relatively short running length makes for a welcome change, especially for this genre. Many Westerns are unnecessarily padded out and can become quite boring, but 'The Salvation' gets on with telling the story and every scene has meaning. It has action, tension, and violence in abundance. An impressive film all round."
" An average western
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,5,"The genre of the western has been slowly dying over the years but I had some interest in seeing the salvation and this film is just pretty forgettable which is a shame. The premise of this film is after a man has his family taken away from him he goes on the hunt for those responsible. Mads mikkelsson is the lead in this film and he does a really good job, he gives a subdued performance but one that you can tell has the anger and emotion in it to make you root for him in this film. Jeffrey dean Morgan plays the villain in this film and he does a good job, he is a pretty clich√© villain but he manages to add some of his charisma to the role which makes him entertaining to watch. Eva green plays a mute character in this film and I never really cared about her in this film, I struggle sometimes with mute characters to connect with them and I think this was one of the problems with green here. All the other characters are paper thin in this film and it is hard to really Care about them in this film. The story is a simple revenge story and when it focuses on that it does work like most films of this sort do. Its when this film tries to focus on other things that it falls down as you really won't care about it. The script is really poor in this film, there is nothing here that stands out or does a good job at making you care about the dramatic scenes and there is no humour to be seen here. The style of this film is very much a straight up western here and some of the action scenes are pretty cool. But this film feels really short and I do feel like this film could have done with being a little longer to help flesh out some of the motivations of some of the characters in the film. Overall this is a film that is just there, it isn't bad but it isn't good so it probably isn't worth a watch."
" ""Don't get into a fight you know you're gonna lose.""
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,8,"I'm finding it hard to believe that this Western was made by a Danish film company. Apparently director Kristian Levring did his homework on the genre and the era he was filming because this had the gritty feel of some of the best American Westerns like ""Unforgiven"" and ""3:10 to Yuma"". In it's way, it's a pretty typical revenge Western, but I don't think that should be taken as a negative. Mads Mikkelsen find himself up against the brutal leader of an outlaw gang, who's brother was killed after raping the wife of Jon Jensen (Mikkelsen) and leaving her and their young son dead.The town of Black Creek is understandably in fear of Henry Delarue's (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) crazed killers, with the town mayor and sheriff willingly agreeing to offer two victims for Delarue to kill if the man who did his brother in isn't found in an impossibly short time frame. A third random victim is added to the body count just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.The wild card in this scenario turns out to be the wife of the slain brother, a good looking but disfigured woman who was scarred by an Indian tribe at a young age. The mute Princess (Eva Green), with her tongue cut out and slashed lips, becomes a patient observer who plots her revenge against Delarue after he takes her for his woman following brother Paul's (Michael Raymond-James) death.One would never recognize the South African filming locations utilized in the story; the resemblance to the arid regions of the American Southwest are striking. The cinematography is nothing short of excellent, with such attention to detail as a fly making it's way across the face of the dead Delarue following the final confrontation between his gang and Jon, with a significant assist from the Princess. Though some may find fault with the final ride into the sunset with Madelaine the Princess accompanying Jon, I didn't take it as the beginning of a romantic entanglement, but the mutual respect accorded by two unwilling victims to each other for what would be the start of a new life."
" Impressed with this western.
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,8,I just watched this movie and was surprised that it was good. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was the reason I decided to watch. He was so good I almost hated him. Forgive me for not knowing the names of the other actors. The Hero and his brother were really good as was the mute lady. Good movie and I'm glad I watched it.
" An ensemble cast lifts the material
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,6,"THE SALVATION is an addition to the familiar revenge western format so beloved by filmmakers in America and Italy. The twist here is that this is a Danish film, with a starring role for the highlight underrated Mads Mikkelsen who has always been a very convincing actor no matter what role he takes on. This short film plays out in a traditional way but it has a noticeably grim edge with a lot of death and destruction meted out en route to a traditional climax. My only real complaint with it is that it's a little too digital, with CGI blood effects and CGI fires throughout, which is probably down to budgetary constraints.An ensemble cast lifts the material and gives the film added power. Eva Green plays a mute girl with her customary relish and seems to really enjoy the opportunity to do something different. Jeffrey Dean Morgan seems to be doing a dry run for his role as Negan in THE WALKING DEAD and is very hateable. Michael Raymond-James was also in THE WALKING DEAD in season two as a villain and is equally imposing here. Douglas Henshall's slimy sheriff and Jonathan Pryce's self-serving mayor are convincing townsfolk. Even Eric Cantona impresses as a hired thug. Mikael Persbrandt (HAMILTON) is effective as Mikkelsen's brother and Sean Cameron Michael (BLACK SAILS) has a tiny but effective role. Altogether these actors combine to make THE SALVATION a solid addition to its genre."
" A western that won't bore you senseless
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,7,"While this film contains many aspects of a traditional western - guns, oil, revenge, a strong dollar - it is a surprisingly concise story. And unlike so many other movies today, it does not aim to hit the 120 minute mark. It aims to keep you entertained for as long as it can, and then it rolls the credits. True-north for this film is conflict. Whether trying to out-pace a horse, or out-gun a gang, Madds finds himself in all the worst places, at the worst times. The action is visceral, and fast. The consequences are brutal, and absolute. Nobody is safe.Gritty, and violent, this is a movie you can actually watch in one sitting. And it thankfully eschews endless scenes of withered, old men staring at each other for hours."
" Trash
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,1,"Just another ""perfect"" example of demoralization of the human spirit in the form of relived tragedies! Simply a one up on who can make a more graphic movie! Our society and the media continues to desensitize our minds to such graphic death, and places a dollar figure on our souls! Don't watch this soul sucking movie."
" Amazing
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,8,"WOW, great film, beautifully shot, well acted, great western. The lighting is harsh and real, the setting leaves dust in your mouth. Very well done. Okay, I could see how it would end a mile away, but still loved it anyway. Whoever the director of photography was is a maniac genius, just so cool to see the clever use of light upon the subjects faces, the minimalist dialogue, evil men being evil for a reason, good men taking revenge for a reason. Love the story, why did it take till 2017 to even hear about this great film?"
" Looking for a great revenge film, this is it
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,10,"Wasn't sure what to make of this when I first saw it on Netflix, but because I like Westerns thought it was worth a try. Not going into details but at a high level, the villain and his brother were truly evil. The action built slowly but in the end it came down to the last man standing. Sort of like the Unforgiven but in my mind better. You will not be sorry you watched this. Needless to say it's violent and definitely R rated."
" A foreigner in a real western
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,10,"I think there are lot of reviews of people who never saw past the first 15 minutes of the film. This is not a ""Danish Western"", and all subtitling and Danish completely ends after the first 15 minutes. This is a solid, simple western through and through. It doesn't dwell on evil, it dwells on good people dealing with evil. The Salvation reaches back to a better time in film-making. It's a lesson on how a western is supposed to make you feel and what you're supposed to learn. The main protagonist is a metaphor for what a western is: a European going on with his life in a wild land, that gets hollowed out by it, and yet is the only mechanism keeping a fickle world together with the remaining good in his character. Nevermind the setting, nevermind the accents, a western is an exploration the elemental aspects of human nature, add some gun play, then it's all wrapped up with an ""into the sunset"" ending. That's what's going to happen here. Virtually everyone in this cast is a revelation. Jeffrey Dean Morgan would have been in a hundred cowboy movies in another time. Mads Mikkelsen is the perfect fit for the subdued killing machine he'll transform into, and Eva Green is the lady that does more with her eyes then all the men do with their mouths. This film, to me, is the quintessential example of how to build a modern western, from the ground up, without looking like you're trying to be clever. Just tell a solid story of great lose, and have the audience climb out with some semblance of redemption. Then you get on your horse, ride into the sunset, credits roll."
" Very poor film
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,3,"Bought this DVD as I fancied a decent western, especially one that had been labelled as gritty. Unfortunately the reviews failed to mention that the script only extended to about 5 pages, the accompanying music was handled with the subtlety of a deaf child and the whole look of this borefest was that of a TV movie with it's woefully cheap CGI rendered fire and patched in monument Valley backgrounds. I'm all for moody films but spend a little coin on some originality rather than assuming that decent actors on the billing can make a good film just by their very presence. It really couldn't have been more clich√©d, more predictable or more tedious than had it been on the True Movies channel. What a literal waste of a couple of hours on an afternoon."
" Good, though fairly one-dimensional
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"The American West in the 1870s. A European settler, Jon Jensen (Mads Mikkelsen), has just welcomed his wife and son to the country when they are kidnapped and murdered. He takes revenge on the murderers, only to discover that one was the brother of a local land baron, Henry Delarue. Delarue runs the local town with a brutal hand. Now he wants vengeance on the man who killed his brother and the local townspeople are too scared of him to stand up to him. Jon is fighting more than just the local thugs, he is facing the entire town...Pretty good, though had the potential to be great. Started very well, with a grittiness not always found in westerns. Jon Jensen's predicament was very intriguing and seemed hopeless, making it very engaging. The feeling of powerlessness and injustice added to this.Some good action scenes too, especially towards the end.However, from a point the plot becomes rather one-dimensional. The end result is far too neat, predictable and easy. There's no twists, no real dilemmas, no development, things just happen without much impediment or anything unexpected occurring.Ultimately, still reasonably good, but a bit disappointing in that it was set up for something even better."
