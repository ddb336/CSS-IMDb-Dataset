" Dope: Geeksta Saga
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,4,"A film about a trio of adolescence trying to navigate the sometimes harsh realities of their inner city world. It's at times moving and poignant and at times just remarkably preachy. The acting here is all solid and the characters are fascinating in their own rights, especially our intrepid trio of stars. There's a message in here that's unique to this as well that I really enjoy. It's a story about being a geek crossing cultural and color lines but it then veers pretty hard into standard ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" territory.I really wanted to like this one but as I'm watching I'm thinking it's interesting. Good not great. Then the ending comes along and really just annoyed the bejesus out of me by having a character speak right to the audience to push their socio-political agenda. It's not even that I have an issue with the stance taken, I think it's valid but it's lazy filmmaking that has to rely on the characters telling the audience directly what the point of it all is. It spoke to either a lack of confidence or a lack of skill on the director's part and that was just a really annoying way to end what was otherwise a solid flick. It's a big pet peeve of mine so I'm hitting it pretty hard for it but I still think this is a decent enough movie for the most part. It's worth checking out just be prepared for the BlackKklansman problem where the last 5 minutes just totally derails the whole thing."
" Great premise and cool characters
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,"A great premise and cool characters (even though some are a bit cliché) sets the viewer up for a funny, sometimes hilarious, ride. If you are not a stickler for a credible story arc, this is a truly great coming of age comedy."
" Surprisingly Original
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie not knowing anything about it. I was basically surfing the movies on Netflix and reading the descriptions and I stumbled onto this one which seemed pretty interesting.I started watching it and thought the main character is nothing like I've seen before in movies about teenagers or movies set in the ghetto. Most of the time, characters like this get preachy and you always feel like you're being force-fed the same message over and over again about how you're supposed to rise up above the environment and circumstances in which you were born. I mean, the film sort of does that, but it does it in a clever way.Nothing about it was cliche, from my perspective anyway. In the beginning, it didn't seem like the protagonist had any chance of surviving or getting out, but when he does succeed in the end, it didn't feel forced or unnatural even though the events leading up to it were ludicrous. But like I said, it was done in a way that was so clever and unexpected that I didn't know how the film was going to end the entire time. I also like how it just wasn't another gangsta movie set in the 90's. It's modern and it feels up to date with how society currently is (heading towards the 2020's), incorporating things like bitcoin and social media seamlessly into its story.I like it. It was worth the effort I spent sifting through Netflix to find a movie this entertaining and original."
" Review
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,7,"Just watched this. I dont know, it was good, it was ok. It was like when your driving down the freeway trying to stay awake and you look over to see an albertsons plastic bag in the passenger seat. At that moment anything that really makes you care is literally forcing you to believe stuff."
" Not good
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,5,I was really disappointed the story telling Is so weak it almost fell like it isn't there
" A funny and unique adventure that leads to a good message at the end.
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,9,"I loved this movie. They developed the setting very well and made the characters stand out from it. The idea of the ""slippery slope"" was something that I kept thinking about after watching it. That idea forms a plotline that builds tension and urgency while still being pretty funny, as is the movie in general. Also great performances from the main characters and ASAP Rocky.
No huge problems with it besides that the second act drags a little bit, not every joke lands, and writing is sometimes a little bit forced."
" The tone is fast and funny, with a modern ""Risky Business"" or ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" vibe, but there's an additional layer that stems from the violence of the neighborhood
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,6,"The tone is fast and funny, with a modern ""Risky Business"" or ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" vibe, but there's an additional layer that stems from the violence of the neighborhood. The stakes are very real for kids like Malcolm, living hand-to-mouth and attending an underfunded school with only one shot at getting out. It's no wonder some top African-American celebs (Sean Combs, Pharrell Williams) have lent support as exec producers of the film.
But unfortunately many scenes seriously overstay their welcome, and don't land the intended laughs. At times the film is just dopey, though there's enough in the mix that's addictive"
" It's like a parody that was made to look like a real movie
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,1,"This movie is two hours long but it feels like four. It's like a parody that was made to look like a real movie but fails. This story is so fantastical and improbable that it wouldn't be out of place if it was made by Disney. Whole plot threads go nowhere and more and more crazy stuff keeps happening to the same three kids. It's freaking ridiculous, and can only be enjoyed by teens 14 and under who don't know the difference between this and the real world."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,7,Good movie with a good story. lots of interesting and memorable parts and some funny parts as well. definitely enjoyed the experience (1 viewing)
" Movie
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,10,Kids are creative. They pick up on trends and use it to their advantage. It's a good movie.
" Representation matters
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,7,"This movie is dope! A nerdy, black kid who dreams of getting into Harvard gets trapped (rather unwittingly) as a drug peddler and has to use his wits to get out of his bad situation. Watch it!And yes, the temptation to stereotype has been nicely avoided, even though the story seems rather stereotyped."
" Surprisingly Good
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,8,"I was not expecting to like this movie. I didn't know anything about it other than the title and the cover. And based on those two things I thought I would probably turn it off within the first five minutes, let alone sit thru the entire thing.But I kept an open mind and I popped it in the player. And I am happily writing a good review for it now. Within the first five minutes I was totally drawn into the story and had completely forgotten that I had ever had any qualms about it to begin with.I was so engrossed in the film that I forgot I didn't even want to watch it! It's not a second too long or two short, and the story flies by and leaves you wanting more. It was almost two hours long, but it felt like it was over in forty-five minutes because I really just got into it so much."
" my favorite movie
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"It's pretty good. kinda feels like a a24 movie.

" It's my turn
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,10,"Malcolm (Shameik Moore) is a geek growing up in ""The Bottom"" section of Inglewood. He wants to go to Harvard. He hangs out with two geek friends Jib (Tony Revolori) and Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) is a lesbian who likes Justin Bieber. They love things from the 1990s. While attending a birthday party at a club there was a shoot out and in all the excitement Malcolm grabs the wrong knapsack and gets the one filled with Molly.With the owner busted, there are others who want the bag while Malcolm stands at the crossroads of his life.Malcolm breaks the stereotype and provides us with an interesting character. There other characters were not as well developed, but were played well. This was one ""thug"" movie that I enjoyed.Guide: F-bomb. Near sex. Nudity (Chanel Iman of Victoria Secret)"
" I wanted this movie to be more than it was
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"I wanted this movie to be a truly original and insightful story masked as something more conventional. It turned out to be something pretty conventional masked as something more original and insightful. It was probably pitched at Sundance as ""Orange County with black nerds!"" Don't get me wrong: I was entertained. The 90s soundtrack was fun, and the main characters appealing, even if the story was predictable as hell and the race politics pretty shallow. I enjoy the occasional movie about nerdy upstarts caught up in something bigger, especially when well done. But I've seen this movie before, and setting it in ""the hood"" seemed less meaningful than the filmmaker thought it was."
" One of the more bizarre movies I have seen
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,9,"Only slight spoilers - nothing to detract from viewing the film. I'm not even looking at the other reviews yet. Next time I catch this film, I'll probably give it 10 out of 10: I'm only giving it 9 because it was quite sophisticated, and at times - difficult for me to follow.It tells the story of 3 African American teenagers, they are ""nerds"", very not-tough, trying to survive through high school in a very violent predominantly black neighborhood and get accepted to college. What struck me at first was the intense black-upon-black violence in this neighborhood - but this is only the backdrop to this movie, and I'd have tuned out if it hadn't evolved.The lead character finds that following a gang shooting he's had heroin and a gun dropped into his schoolbag (which he discovers while going through the school metal detector, ho ho!). These 3 teens have to practically run for their lives, And the main character (who knows NOTHING about drug dealing) has to concoct a plan to sell the stash for a profit.Also, I liked that this was nearly an all black cast film: and a really good one.Bizarre stuff - was worth my time."
" Decent film, great music **NO SPOILERS**
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,7,"OK, there's a hell of a lot right with this film but it does also just stray off the rails a bit in places. Basically, I felt it got a bit silly in parts but that didn't really spoil the whole. The best thing(s) though are the three friends, especially Shameik Moore - he's so watchable it's untrue. Also Kiersey Clemons just charms the camera to death!Classic old school hiphop makes the film more enjoyable, and it's a feelgood way of spending 90 minutes.A bass in ya face 7 straight outta 10 from me"
" Horrible movie
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,3,"Don't waste your time watching this terrible movie. It combines elements from popular movies, but fails in bringing a narrative that is either interesting or logical. The comedic aspect of it was campy at best and the drama unrealistic, which is sad because the movie had a lot of potential."
" Disappointing..
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,3,"I'm really surprised by the high rating. I did not enjoy this movie at all.The scenes involving the main character and two other girls were painstakingly bad and unrealistic. I'm incredibly tired of Hollywood misrepresenting what the human courting process really looks like, and this movie gives a very clear example of what it does not look like. Like come on, the guy acts like the most shy and uncertain kid in the world and somehow the girls make all of the advances? Wake up.. who the hell let this stuff slide?It didn't really seem like a comedy. I honestly can't recall laughing, although I do admit it was slightly entertaining at times.It really felt like this movie was made for teenagers (like most movies these days.. unfortunately). If you're outside of this demographic you probably will not enjoy it that much.I didn't enjoy the ""joke"" of a white character bringing up the issue of the N word and how he uses it in a well intentioned manner just like the other characters, but despite it he is slapped for a second time when saying it, resulting in the hysterical laughing of the other characters. Was this honestly supposed to be funny? The white character actually had a good point. Either way it seemed incredibly racist.The one thing I liked about this movie was the music. That was like the one silver lining. I do not recommend this movie."
" Could've been a dope movie, but lacked originality
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,5,"Before jumping on the bandwagon of criticism, let me elaborate the first half hour of the movie. Started indifferent, but due to the use of 90's hip-hop, indie music and the aim to be 'not your typical hood movie' I began to grow an interest. Oh boy oh boy, I was in for a tough ride.The cast was decent, but needed something stronger. The character that hold my attention was Diggy (played by Kiersey Clemons) as a gay female growing up in the suburbs. Nevertheless, she didn't play an important role in the movie. Let me first talk about the main character, Malcolm (Shameik Moore). From all the actors one could choose, why him? He portrays characters so dull and it seems that his life has been sucked down the drain, just like Netflix's The Get Down. Don't get me wrong, the first season of the Get Down was a fun ride, but not thanks to of mister Shoalin Fantastic. His method of acting is, against my liking, amateurish. He comes of as an ""actor"" that has been plucked from the streets to star in a movie. He lacks a certain charisma for the big screen. This already puts his character, Malcolm, in a bad spot. A totally unbelievable movie with the wrong cast. The side-characters are fun, to a certain degree, but it needed a heavy weight.The main story sounds fun on paper, but is in fact poorly executed. It felt cringe worthy most of the time. Especially filling all the gaps in between dialogue with music. Every scene it starts off with a 'hip, cool, trendy' tune. It reminds me a lot of Tangerine (2015). However, this movie used music as a certain emotion that needed to be explained. Dope just used music, because... hey why not? Dope needed something better than the typical A-class student that needs to make a short- or long-term decision. The ending is totally obvious from the start of the movie. The dialogue was off as well. Let me package and summarise my point of critique with one question. Molly/MDMA/XTC gives you the best sex ever? I don't want to be vulgar, but everyone that ever used these substances knows sex isn't or at least barely doable when this chemical is surging throughout your body. However, all critique given, it was a meh film. I was able to sit through the entire movie. Do I recommend this movie? Not really, even though I know a lot of people that like the goal the movie is aiming for, but it just doesn't prove it."
" Great film, but a bit sloppy in areas.
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"This was a thoroughly entertaining film with a lot of great things to say, but there are definitely many aspects of this film that could've used a bit more polish. The script is fantastically witty and provides plenty of opportunities not only to entertain the viewer but to give them some mental food to chew on and most of the actors gave great performances. However, there were some rather jarring aspects of the film that distracted from the viewing experience. Many scenes suffer from continuity and editing issues: like the position or disposition of the actors changes from one cut to the next or what actually happened in the scene is hard to follow because of huge, sudden jumps from one event to the next. And while most of the actors were great, Zoe Kravitz seemed to be really out of her depth here. I didn't realize it was her until the end credits, but I kept wondering why the chemistry between her character and Malcolm was so incredible confusing: ""is she TRYING to put him in the friend-zone?"" I kept asking myself. Overall, that entire relationship could've been left completely out of the movie and the film might've been better off for it.This last film-making gripe probably wouldn't bother too many people, but I also thought the sound was terrible, at least in regard to dialogue. There were many scenes that were out in the open but it was painfully obvious that the dialogue and or ""live"" music was recorded in a studio. This is the potential spoiler part...Oh, and while I thought much of what the film had to say about race or growing-up-in-the-ghetto issues was rather profound and seemed on-point, there's one line from the film on that subject that is still just frustratingly grating on me. On his revised Harvard application, Malcolm ends it with ""'So why do I want to go to Harvard??'--if I was white would you even have to ask me that?"" Just... WTF dude. YES OF COURSE THEY ASK WHITE PEOPLE WHY THEY WANT TO GO TO HARVARD!!! It's hard for anyone and everyone (except maybe the offspring of rich, heavily-donating Harvard alumni) to get in to Harvard. Talk about a self-created sense of persecution. Despite all those flaws though, it was still an incredibly entertaining and enjoyable film."
" Everything about this clicks!
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,10,"I've been looking at this movie for ages. It seemed like it would be great visually, and that it would have an amazing soundtrack. The story didn't seem bad either. I still didn't rent it until now, and it definitely was everything I hoped for - and more.Visually this movie is exactly what I was hoping. The cinematography is nice, and very colourful, which is always great. The costume department also has done an amazing job. I want all the outfits worn by the main characters, Malcolm, Diggy and Jib. The soundtrack is unbelievably good, and I am so glad it's on Spotify. Every song has it's perfect place in the movie, and the songs are great by themselves as well.I really like the story. Malcolm is a clever kid who wants to go to Harvard, even if he comes from a bad neighbourhood. All the turns and twists his life takes during this movie are amazing. While the story in a way is very classic and in that way predictable, there are many details that won't fail to surprise you. Another amazing thing about the writing is the dialogue. It sometimes takes the Tarantino kind of way, where the characters are talking about something completely different before a crucial plot point. The best example is the character Dom talking about politics before the party takes a different turn.Dope is a surprising movie with a very fresh feeling. It's a pleasure to watch, yet it has it's not so pleasant moments. Everything about this movie just clicks!"
" A slippery slope... to banality
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,5,"When we grow up we all have our dreams. Some want to go to college, some want to score hot babes, some want to be in a cool band, some want to be an OG, sell dope and wear a thick golden chain around their necks. And some want to shoot films about these folks.Well, it seems to me that at least Rick Famuyiwa made his dream come true. Well, in a sense that he managed to end up behind a camera and orchestrate the action in front of it. However, being a writer/director of a film doesn't give you a magic ability to truly fit the shoes of your characters. Instead, when you make a film about someone else's dreams, it's more like a story of how you imagine those dreams would be. And, in case of Dope, that's a big difference...We're all tired of those hardcore gangsta homies. So let's spin the story around a non-typical ""nerd"" black guy. He's the one who gets picked at by bullies and he's the one who actually plans to take the SATs. But that's just too flunky for the ""tough"" part of the target audience, so let's make our hero unlikely appealing to all sorts of women, getting in some nasty business with serious people, and eventually out-streetwise'ing them on the way to his dreams, so that it looks both generally satisfying and still unconventional. And yeah, let's make it all in style, just like we love it: a mix of Tarantino and Apatow, with a sprinkle of bling and hip-hop on top.Well, unfortunately, some things just don't go together well, at least not if you want believability. For example, you can't make a story of a nerdy wimp who goes nose-deep into the criminal business, to the point when he's bound to ask himself whether he's still the ""good guy"" he used to position himself as, gets on top of the situation and comes back to the surface as nothing but the profitable stuff stuck to him.It could've worked if Dope was trying to be Burn-After-Reading-like hilarious, because crazy things do happen when you assume that people are ridiculous. Or if Dope just remained a high-as-sh!t Pineapple-Express-kind-of flick through and through, because crazy things do happen when people are whacked out of their minds. But you don't start with the half-bizarre half-dummy approach, then go all dark and dramatic, and then go back and feed us the MC-Hammer-style dance moves during the ending credits. These numbers just don't add up.But the true problem of this movie is not those schizophrenic mood swings of its script. It's the fact that everything we see on screen tries its best not to be stereotypical and to avoid the clichés, but ends up simply fake, as if a dope dealer and a school straight-A nerd got their bodies switched, but their minds remained the same, totally ignorant of what their counterpart's life is really about. Malcolm is a geek, but only in terms of what other people might think geeks are about. Dom and Co are shady guys, but also just what you might think of them from passing them by on the street or watching a black gang movie. Neither side of this story had enough consistency to hold its weight, and the only explanation we get is that everything's ""complicated"". It sure as hell is, just not in the right way!The cherry on top of this festival of cardboard adventure is a scene with the purse maker. Every single thing you could've gotten wrong about people if you never actually cared to learn what they really do - it's all there. A fake bag maker who's also a blackmarket Bitcoin dealer. Who's also operating a computer with a two-button mouse with no wheel (it's 2015 guys, I really have no idea where the filmmakers dug up that fossil). Who's also testing his customers with a pseudo-insightful mumbo-jumbo speech and a demand of punching him in the jaw. Yes! If anything could beat a druggie who looks like a clown and moonlights as a mask-wearing pro hacker, that would be the only thing. Congrats guys, that's really dope.The only thing this movie didn't manage to fit inside is that if you're a black man and you don't do sports, then going to Harvard is still possible even without having to deal with arms or drugs or even pop-punk bands and videoblogging. You know, you could just be normal, doing the same boring stuff the white guys do. Maybe that's not fun enough, but at least it's real. But who wants to be real when you can go with a cool flat-top afro and a bunch of funky dance moves instead, right?"
