" Far From Better Than The Original Short
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,4,"The Nut Job was based on a short, but was very poorly executed. Maybe the animation is okay. But it won't really make up for it since the story is generic and at times spiteful. This movie contains so much betrayals for all the wrong reasons. That and what makes it a mean movie is the characters are obnoxious and despicable. And the tone makes it worse with its hypocritical message about sharing. The movie tells us sharing is the right thing. And yet, again, it's driven with the betrayals throughout the movie that makes the mood of it feel dull. Not to mention the comedy wasn't effective at all. Honestly, for how the movie got me in a pretty bad mood, I don't even recommend this to kids. can't say it's the worst animated movie I've seen, but this was nuts. No pun intended."
" ""No Nuts for the Wicked""
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,2,"Horrible watch, won't watch again, and can't recommend, even for younger audiences.I have no idea how this thing got a sequel. It's supposed to be two parallel mob heist stories, but they don't really line up past there being a heist.None of the characters are interesting or likeable, maybe the girl squirrel, the dog, and the mute rat but that's more because they are lovable stupid / naive. You're not supposed to still dislike the ""heroes"" at the end of the movie. The writing parts of this that are remotely interesting are too complex for kids to get and they don't pan out.It's literally a lot of ""squirrels like nuts"", ""squirrels try to get nuts"", ""humans don't like squirrels"", repeat.Anything endearing about this is more annoying. Even when the ""twists"" happen, they don't mean anything because they're all still jerks, even if they happened to do the right thing."
" Guilty pleasure
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,6,I like watching it because of how wierd it is and how funny it is.
" This movie freakin sucks.
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,1,Cheap animation and loud lazy humor make this movie one of the worst ever made.
" The nut job
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,8,"We are in the age now where there are literally hundreds of films released a month, on DVD or in the cinema, there is a lot of choice.I have to say it is rare for animation films that aren't done by Disney/Pixar to become huge success's except the Shrek series. Some of the best I've seen have included the lorax and despicable me.This film isn't good, it isn't overly entertaining and in my opinion is solely for kids, the joy of most animated films is parents and kids can all enjoy them, this isn't one though.Like hop, bolt and now the nut job, you cant just make any animal you think of a good character, the plot isn't overly interesting and there is nothing that would make me recommend this film to anyone over the age of 6.I've seen better straight to TV animated movies, this will be available for next to nothing on DVD in a few months, please don't spend your hard earned money on it.I never give spoilers, but with this film its hard to spoil as its already pretty awful"
" THE WTF JOB
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,4,"A really confused scatty plot with confusing characters, weak script and no point really. The animation is excellent tho. A waste."
" Loveless
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,2,Loveless movie with a story to forget and few acceptable moments.
" The Nut Job
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,6,"This movie really was...well, a nut job. But they genuinely tried to make something good, and I can appreciate that."
" It's meh
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,5,The animation's fine and the story had a lot of potential but the movie as a whole is meh. The characters vary from ok to just dumb and unlikable. Surly (Will Arnett) in particular is hard to root for when his antics endanger his friend Grayson (Brenden Fraiser) who goes along with his plans as they have no other means of survival. The only character I thought was genuinely likable was the pug Precious (Maya Rudolph). I thought she could be funny and fun to watch. Everyone else not so much. I'd say skip this one and the sequel.
" WE CAN'T CHANGE WHO WE ARE
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,6,"Surley (Will Arnett) is a hard working libertarian prepper squirrel. He comes across a big score with a wagon that vends roasted nuts. Andie (Katherine Heigl), the cute liberal squirrel wants Surley to share his find with the group, that haven't been able to save up enough food for the winter in Liberty Park of Oakton.Through a series of circumstances, the park stash gets destroyed and Surley is blamed. The head coon (Liam Neeson) banishes Surley to the city where our resourceful libertarian discovers a horde of nuts which Andie butts in and wants him to share. He discovers the head coon wants to control the food supply so he can control the masses...or at least the 47% ers. Grayson (Brendan Fraser) is the puffed chest phoney conservative hero who takes credit for the work done by the libertarian. But only by working together can they get rid of the coon in power.While they are planning an Ocean's Eleven heist of the nuts, the humans are planning a bank robbery.Great film for the kids so they can tell their teacher they are ""getting a nut"". Also, stealing is good. Let me know how this works out for you."
" Bills Reviews For Short Attention Spans
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,6,"A fairly fun cartoon that focuses its laughs more for kids than adults. The plot concerns itself with storing up enough food for winter, and the parks animals that are trying to do so. We have the standard reluctant hero, the blowhard, the villain, the girl, and the sidekick that never gives up. Thrills abound, and there are even a few laughs for the adults. While this film falls a bit short for the grown-ups, the kids should have a pretty fun time. A Note for those twisted like myself; be on the lookout for evil personified in the guise of a Cardinal!"
" What a waste of time.
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,1,This movie is a copy of over the hedge but this is more horrible. Characters are unlikeable and stupid especially the main character. The animation is OK but apart from that it is just garbage.
" life of forrest creatures
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you the rarely seen lives of tiny forest creatures such squirrels. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Upsettingly average and exploitative
",2018-04-03 00:00:00,6,"I was worried when I noticed that the bird on the shoulder of the animal leader is a Northern Cardinal, visually and internally styled to resemble the Cardinal from the game Angry Birds. My worries were confirmed when I heard the hit song Gangnam Style play almost out of nowhere, as the movie's main characters suddenly started to dance to the said tune. Technically, the story did give characters a reason to do the said short dance when they did it, though in a palpably heavy-handed way. Also technically, all rats animated using modern computer graphics are going to show similarities, but the rat character by the name of Buddy sure does look a lot like the main character of the animated movie Ratatouille. For that matter, all the animal characters resemble the various animals of Dreamworks and Disney films from recent times. This, ladies and gentlemen, sure does feel like a cash-in. Nut Job is a joint venture between South Korean, US and Canadian production companies that shows symptoms of trying hard to capitalise on the western animation market and the pop culture. This is all particularly unfortunate when you consider that actual work was put into this production. Although the movie certainly has other problems, to be discussed shortly, the film does have a plot, it has a number of highly acclaimed actors that do a relatively good job at portraying their characters (however poorly those characters may have been written), and the animation is not terrible, even if rather bland. There are a few funny moments to experience, even though some jokes fall flat. There are certainly worse things to watch out there, but ultimately this Nut Job is botched (Pa-dum tss?). In addition to its irritating exploitative nature, Nut Job suffers from poor writing. The general outlines of the story are simple and clear, but the individual scenes become less and less coherent as time goes by, less and less natural. There are many lines of dialogue that seem like were meant to be funny, or at least there is no other discernible purpose for them, like comments on smelly farts, but they aren't in fact funny. This is a movie that is mildly entertaining and would probably go over well with young kids alive in the year in which the movie was produced, the year in which the musician PSY was still relevant, but it is unfortunate that a movie with so many good actors and such a budget is so average. The cash-in was successful, however. The movie more than made back its investment. I will not however be watching Nut Job 2. I'd have to be nutty to do that....Eh? Eh? Shut this down."
" A great lesson to learn for the kids
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,7,"Modern technological advancements have reached the point where small animation studios can bring feature animation films to the big screen with good production values. ""The Nut Job"" certainly can't be put in the same category as Pixar or Dreamworks, but it has charm in its own way.""The Nut Job"" is a heist movie about a squirrel who plans to raid a nut shop after being kicked out of the park. Featuring a star studded cast with the likes of Will Arnett as the main character Surly, Brendan Fraser, Liam Neeson, Katherine Heigl or the stern Stephen Lang, the nutty film brings out a wonderful adventure of friendship and betrayal with plenty of good qualities for the kids to learn and understand.It's not the funniest movie, but it manages to touch one's heart and make them become sympathetic for the honesty of the characters, especially the mute rat Buddy.
""The Nut Job"" gives out a good example to children: help others and don't always chase personal gain. I recommend this animated movie for children as it may teach them a valuable lesson in life."
" Typical plots
",2018-01-03 00:00:00,6,"Watched a long time ago, probably 2 yeas ago or longer, it was a simple story and plots are expectable. Good for kids and family, but not very attractive to any adult, yet still an acceptable time killer. The artwork is average, can't compare with Disney nor Dreamwork, there are many not smooth stiffness 3D moments in this movie. Great to watch on Amazon because it wouldn't worth to buy a ticket in theater, and I hope the sequel, The Nut Job 2 will be released on Amazon very soon. Lol, I don't mind to watch it for free.What's the story about? (Spoiler might include)
A typical script about the counterattack of a grassroot, the hero is a 'freak/looser' in his community, he senses something different and comes out ideas, lastly saves everyone at the end."
" A pretty unlikeable and unfunny film.
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,3,"I don't think I've heard a title as stupid as ""The Nut Job"". This is probably one of the dumbest titles given not to an animated film, but any film in general. Seriously, who names their movie after a synonym for idiot? Well, apparently the people at Toon Box Studios think that the title is hilarious, and it's not. Neither is the film either. Not only that, but this movie is pretty mean spirited too, and not in a good way. I'll explain why this is.As winter is coming quick, the animals of Liberty Park led by Raccoon (Liam Neeson) are quickly trying to get food which they are getting very little of. One of the reasons is the squirrel Surly (Will Arnett) and his silent rat sidekick Buddy who have been stealing the parks food for their own pleasure. However, after an incident with a nut cart (because those exist in real life), the animals expel him from the park. They then discover a closed nut shop across from the park which is really a criminal hideout as its right across the street from a bank. After one of the squirrels from the park named Andie (Katherine Heigl) discovers Surly's little secret they negotiate a deal to split the nuts in the shop. The rest of the movie is basically a couple of animals in the park planning to steal the nuts, while the criminals in the nut shop plan to steal from the bank with both of their plans coincidentally matching up. I think you can figure out the rest of the film from there.I'm just going to get my biggest problem with this movie out of the way first. The characters in this movie, especially our main character Surly, are awful. Surly is so unlikeable that his attitude really makes you want to punch him. Even when his sidekick does something to save him, the poor rat is tortured by Surly as he is constantly choked, yelled at, and gets hurt for no reason whatsoever. The other characters however, are just clichéd. There's a egotistical dumb squirrel played by Brenden Fraser who really offers nothing to the film, Andie whose just a squirrel who hate Surly at first, but warms up to him later, and Raccoon who is just a villain who has a stupid sabotage plot up his sleeve. You get the idea. The story has some promise, but fails to deliver. I like the idea of squirrels trying to steal nuts from a shop to survive winter, but the fact is that this was based on the director's five minute student film. This is one reason the film doesn't work. Another thing I disliked was the very pointless bank subplot. I didn't care about these robbers at all. The one the thing I found tolerable is the animation. While some of the human animation looked pretty bad, the animation of the animals looked impressive enough. I also think the animators got some of the slapstick down pretty well. However, it's not a strong compliment.""The Nut Job"" is one of the most mean spirited animated movies I've seen. It's so awful that it could be pretty hard for some people to watch. Well, then again, this is a movie that was released in January, and we all know how terrible movies are when they are released this month. In case your kids really badly want to see this movie, bring an Epi-pen. You might need it by the end of the film."
" A failed animation
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,5,"Surly, an exiled, selfish and self-centered squirrel teams up with some other animals to raid a nut shop in other to help the exact same park which threw him away. At the same time, in the same building, a similar job is being planned and executed by humans but with a higher stake.It's a very linear story full of expected events interfering from time to time with ridiculous decisions. The characters are badly created with inexplicable personalities and judgment which obviously do not transmit any emotion or feeling to the viewer. Judging by the trailers, it should have been funny, entertaining and interesting but sadly, I have to say that they were a lot better than this entire movie. No laughter, no story, no characters, no nothing. It looks great and it is well animated though, but that's about it. I cannot recommend a movie just because it looks good, not even an animation and especially not this one. A bad film overall."
" Rip Off of ""Over The Hedge"" but not as good made on a PS2
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,1,"Pretty much what my title says, is my review.Animation that would have been amazing in the year 2000, when the PS2 was launched.Terrible voice acting of stereotyped characters.The whole story is nothing new. You've seen it before in ""A Bugs Life"" and ""Over The Hedge"". Except both of those movies do the job a whole lot better. In fact, this movie just seems (to me) to be a wholesale rip off of ""Over The Hedge""Having said all of that, My 5-year-old daughter enjoyed the movie."
" ...And Now There's a Sequel.
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,1,"A poorly animated, completely unfunny kids comedy about a selfish squirrel who learns nothing, willing to do anything (including lying, stealing and mistreating his friends) in order to bypass a tyrannical raccoon ""villain"" whose main crime is...storing food for the winter for all his furry friends? And of course there's an animated Psy dancing to Gangnam Style during the credits. Because Hollywood hates you and your children."
" Lazy plot and uninteresting characters
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,4,"The fact that the word 'forgettable' appears in just about every review for this film says a lot about how unoriginal and lazy it is. I can't remember the last time I watched an animated film and couldn't wait for it to finish, but that's how I felt about 'The Nut Job'.The animation in this film is great, but it's not enough to distract away from the complete lack of a plot. Characters often make or break animated films and, writing this review a day after watching the film, I can't remember any of the characters or their names.'The Nut Job' is watchable but will probably be enjoyed much more by kids. The only thing I enjoyed about this film was the animation - the plot and characters were completely... forgettable."
" Terrible, just terrible
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,1,"I was tricked into watching this movie particularly due to the decent animation. My cousin and I got all excited when my father took us to see this movie thinking it was gonna be good. Boy, we were wrong! The majority of the voice actors (especially Liam Neeson) sound like they hate the film, the jokes suck and are inappropriate, and the frequent use of the song Gangnam Style (which I hate) is annoying as crap. The only thing I liked about this film was the dog (don't remember her name) who thought her tail had a mind of its own when she wagged it. That's all. I totally regret having my parents watch this movie. This is one out of several bad films I've seen with my family that we never speak of.I'll stick with Alvin and The Chipmunks no matter how bad people say it is because I actually enjoyed it."
" Not the Worst Animated Film Out there But Just an Unpleasant Film To Watch
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,2,"Well what go wrong with a film called ""The Nut Job""?.Well pretty much everything Is wrong with this, the characters (apart from Andie and Buddy) are so mean-spirited and unlike able, the story is a ripoff of Over the Hedge, the jokes are just nut puns and the humor pretty low brow.Only good thing?, the animation looks pretty decent, It got nice lighting, nice character designs and the backgrounds look pretty good, but yet again, that's the ONLY GOOD THING about this movie.This is not suitable for kids, not suitable for families, It's not suitable for ANYONE.This get a 2/10."
