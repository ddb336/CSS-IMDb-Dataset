" Russian Cinema at Its Best
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Spectacular portrayal of a crumbling society, using the most explicit metaphor."
" a wonder nobody has been imprisoned...
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,8,"For making such a provoking and socialrealistic frame on the russian society of today. i gues most of these thoughts raised in this film are real life circumstances /situations, and im glad that corruption or the milking or the level of bribery are just a hump in the road here in norway caompared to the former ussr, russia, ukraine and so on, which appears to me like driving your car of a 3000 feet cliff.if youre in for a cataclysmic action thriller you are in the wrong lane, because this is raw russian life for real, saggy grey dark and icecold, where humanity is at a all time low and there are nowhere to run.if you can live under circumstances like that , then the grumpy old man can recommend a look. because its gritty and sickenintg, the acting are good, and the subtitling over the average."
" Who is the fool?
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,9,"""The Fool"" is the best work of the talented Yuriy Bykov. A bold and cruel political satire as a sentence to the ""swamp"" in which the ""elite"" of modern Russian society found itself. And who are the fools? Yes, we are all fools who tolerate this ""elite""."
" Unfulfilled
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,7,"If only the director was generous enough to give the end scene where the building slowly collapsed and zoom out, I will cry in happiness. Yet, the feeling for the existing ending is still full with emotion but more of a strong Schrodinger cats feel which secretly entails that Dima maybe wrong. I had to consolate myself that what Dima did was worth it and the ending made it very difficult for me."
" A VERY GOOD WATCH !!
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,8,"In Durak (The Fool), Russian director Yury Bykov presents the story of a young idealistic plumber who wages a lonely war against the system and society steeped in corruption where honesty, integrity and empathy for fellow beings appear to alien values. The Fool is the story of Dima Niktin (Artyom Bystrov), a young plumber who finds himself at the mercy of small-town government bureaucracy when he discovers that the tenement building he is servicing is in imminent danger of collapse.In an unnamed Russian town, Dima Nikitin (Bystrov) is a plumber and heads the local municipal repair crew maintaining several buildings. Late one onight, Dima is asked to attend to an emergency plumbing job in one of the rickety communal housing buildings in the neighboring districts which houses the poor including an assortment of drunkards and social outcasts.While completing the repair, Dima unearths a much larger problem, as he finds that the exterior wall behind the pipe has cracked and has started to tilt. On further inspection, Dima realizes the building wall has developed a deep fissure from the ground level right up to the roof. As he assesses the extent of this damage, Dima calculates that the fissure could cause the building split into two halves and would ultimately collapse within the next 24 hours.
The knowledge that the 800 odd inhabitants face imminent death and require immediate evacuation wouldn't let Dima resign himself that the building is in not in his regular jurisdiction and would be responsibility of his colleague. So, despite the objections of his his protective wife and nagging mother, Dima rushes to inform his seniors who are gathered at the 50th birthday party of Nina Galaganova (Nataliya Surkova), the town's imperious mayor. In doing so, he bypasses his direct boss, the corrupt inspector of public housing, Federotov (Boris Nevzorov). Soon, we get to know that Federotov had received funds for a major overhaul of the building, he had only supplied a new coat of paint and had funneled the remaining money on his daughter's personal residence. On hearing the news of the impending disaster, Nina begins an extended, closed-doors meeting with Dima, Federotov and heads of several other departments, including the fire brigade. As the assembled try to pass the buck on culpability and increasingly blatant and aggressive accusations fly thick and fast and long buried skeletons come tumbling down, the fact that this city council (and, by extension, Russia's ruling class) is rotten to the core becomes painstakingly clear to Dima. However, his sense of responsibility would not allow him to relinquish his responsibility towards the residents of that ill fated building and he strives to to do his best to safeguard them even if it would mean putting himself and his family in peril.The movie presents an explosive combination of highly personal moral drama upon the canvas of a wider, scathing commentary of a country in which corruption and greed seem to be the only shared values left. This well-oiled narrative machine is further aided by the inherent race against time that ratchets up the tension about a building on the brink of collapse threatening heavy casualties among its indigent residents even as the key bureaucrats and politicians are engrossed in their vodka-addled blamegames and intrigue to protect themselves. The humble plumber Dima, on the other hand, with his steadfast integrity and ethics, is the titular fool, who represents the conscience and the moral compass of a society which is muddled in the miasma of selfishness and corruption.
The director Yury Bykov has wrote, directed and edited the film has also composed the music which sets the right mood for the proceedings which unfold at a brisk pace in the course of a single night. He also employs several overt and subtle metaphors like the crumbling building representing Russia as a whole resulting from deep seated corruption of its ruling class of politicians and bureaucrats, the night itself in which the entire story unfolds indicating the dark tidings that engulf the country and the indifference and helplessness of the ordinary folk resulting in their lack of empathy and sense of responsibility for fellow beings indicating the prevailing social conditions.
Bykov assembles an effective cast who deliver remarkable performances especially Artyom Bystrov who is terrific as the humble and naive plumber, Dima and the Natalia Surkova as Nina, the mayor of the town. Running just over two hours, The Fool, despite being set in Russia, has relevance which would resonate across several regions beyond Russia where the hapless citizenry suffer under the power of an abusive authority and greed of the ruling class.This powerful social drama has won numerous awards at several films festivals across the globe and was also highly appreciated at the Bengaluru International Film Festival in 2014."
" This is Serbia, too
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,8,"This movie is so realistic and true, it shook me deeply. Even though I consider Russian actors very good, the actors here were so brilliant, I was surprised. Also, this could easily be a town in Serbia. So, it's not that the Russians are corrupted and evil and un-humane, it just happens that circumstances made them corrupted, evil etc. The same situation is in Serbia, even worse. Sad, but true."
" Exciting and shocking at the same time
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,8,"During a nightly emergency repair a plumber discovers that the appartment building is in a really bad shape and is about to collapse. He comes into action but the municipal administration and the real estate mafia (who turn out to be connected inseparably) let their own (financial) interests prevail.""Durak"" is of the same year as ""Leviathan"" (2014, Andret Zvyagintsev) and about the same subject (real estate corruption in Russia). ""Durak"" is a bit less philosophical but it has a thriller element in the form of the appartment building that can collapse every minute.In Dutch ""Doerak"" means ""rascal"". In Russian ""Durak"" means ""fool"". The title of the film says something about the Russian society, because in Western eyes the main charachter of the film is not a fool but a hero. In Russia however, they look different at these things. Not only is the real estate maffia not amused with the actions of the pluber, so are his wife (you bring the family into danger) and the occupants of the appartment building (leave us alone).The appartment building may be in danger of collapsing, the Russian society has already collapsed in the film, permeated as it is with cynism in all layers of society.By the way, also in the Western world there are accidents attributable to deferred maintenance. Remember the 2017 fire in the Grenfelltower (England), an appartment building with mainly poor occupants and poor fire safety."
" Best Movie from Russia right now
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,10,Loved it! So fresh! So Honest! Great Soundtrack also!
" A desperate movie about a desperate society.
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,9,I am really surprised that this movie didn't get any attention. such an interesting and unique movie A truly great portrait of the dramatic clash between morality and greed.
" Amazing illustration of Russian reality.
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,9,"An excellent illustration of modern Russia with all its shades and accents of the relationship between ""authority"" to the people, and among themselves... and the people to ""authority"", and among themselves.
It is sad to admit, but if the viewer/tourist wants to see the real life of Russians outside of the safe tourist line/zone - this film is the most correct, ideal example."
" The description of the ruling class can be regarded as three-thirds of the wood.
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,9,"The description of the ruling class can be regarded as three-thirds of the wood. Some of the plots are not very natural. For example, the reaction of the whole family is too abrupt after the man runs home and accepts them without asking the reason. The final result is ironic. There is no body in repairing bridges and roads."
" chilling and profound
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,10,"I am surprised that this movie didn't get more attention. ""The fool"" is such an interesting and unique movie, set in a poor town in Russia, where corruption is a big issue. This movie focuses a lot on the characters motivations and morals, even though the topic of political corruption is so often made into a ""evil big politics vs good poor people"" theme, this movie tries to be more grey in its depiction.
Instead of just showing you political higher ups that are just assholes for the movies sake, it goes deeper and presents its whole system as flawed and as a result people only caring about themselves. The plot revolves a lot around the question of responsibility and sacrifices.
The characters are relatable and the movie can create so much tension, the acting is good overall and in some scenes it really shines. The atmosphere created by its music and camera shots was perfectly fitting to the scene, from long drawn out shots with jarring noises that makes you feel the cold of this Russian winter, to conversations in conference rooms which makes you feel claustrophobic.
Overall I would say that this movie is perfectly made, from its very gripping story to its interesting questions about morality."
" a short moment from real life.
",2018-03-27 00:00:00,8,A short moment from real life. a very realistic approach. plain and self-expression. This film that should be definitely to be watched.
" Dostoevsky's classical existentialist narrative
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"On the surface, the movie is about a common corrupted society, where we usually correlate with Russia or some developing countries. A simple young heart, believes in justice and mere moral defines the true existence of human being, also distinguishes us from animals, tries to oppose the corrupted 'animal' society and sadly breaking apart like his father. I'm not sure whether he could survive physically from his attempt to resurrect the human moral, but even if he survives, I'm sure he'll be dead in his soul which could lead him to drink to death. Underneath the story, you'll encounter the very same question that Nietzsche and Dostoevsky had struggled with, do we afford to be saved? Do we need to change our course to extinction? Would we be changed if we're saved? Isn't it who we are as it is?One of the greatest Russian movies ever."
" The desperate rebellion for rescue operation from a nobody
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"The whole story of this film tortured good and evil of human nature in Russian society. The film begins in a dilapidated building where a man with a tattoo beat his wife and daughter because he could not find his case-dough. This building is the home to a group of desperate bottom-class people whose lives revolve around drug, alcoholism, quarrels, gambling and domestic violence. Suddenly, the heating pipe of this dilapidated building busted. Plums include Dima ran over to check, but found a more serious problem. This building's foundation was slowly collapsed and skewed, whose body has cracked two gaps. This building, which may be collapsed within 24 hours, is home to more than 800 households. And then, late at night the actor Dima hurried to put on his clothes, out of the house to the mayor's birthday party. With hands on the jacket pocket, he walked firmly on the desolate road, no turning back. Such a section shows the young fool, who is an ordinary person taking ordinary wages and self-learning architecture, bear a taste of the heroism. The behavior, which he walked in this way, is equivalent to embarked on the plot that an unimportant person fight against the total putrid social system of ""no return"", aiming to rescue the bottom class residents. Through some relationships, Dima found the mayor of the town, as well as the relevant ministers, and told the situation of the dilapidated building. After investigation, these corrupt officials admitted that this building was about to collapse. However, in the face of human life and interests, those corrupt bureaucracies had made a brutal choice.The film plot reverse several times, meaning that the story was falling into a darker situation. The Dima's intention to save the inhabitants gradually was evolved into a group of politicians fighting, those who were originally singing the praises of each other politicians, but instantly tore skins, shirk the responsibility, ignoring 800 lives, and even assassinated two officials in their gang.The film reveals the director attitude is very ambiguous, or a very pessimistic treatment. At the hazard of his life, Dima called down all the inhabitant from the first floor to the ninth floor of the dilapidated building. However, the first reflection of the most people was not Thanksgiving, but doubt. And then the most brutally beat Dima hardly. The irony was that the next one to the battle was also hurt. The director hinted that the resident in the building was indeed hopeless, and was too obstinate to be awakened on the brink of death. Finally, Dima was helpless abandoned near the dangerous building which would collapse. From three aspects to I would discuss the film to show my thoughts. Firstly, talking about the dangerous building, in where the vertical and horizontal cracks spread from the ground, like centipede plated outside the building. In fact, this dilapidated building can be considered as a mirror map to reflect the corruption, decline, emptiness and darkness of the government system. As for the tilt of this dangerous building naturally had not been repaired repeat, not to mention that the collapse of the national system was underway. Secondly, talking the bureaucrats, whose dress splendidly and squander at the Mayor's birthday party. Government placement costs were swallowed by the officials, while the bottom due to the system's irresistible force stepped into extinction. It is not difficult to imagine the direction of the national conditions of the whole country, irresistible sense of trembling hit in audiences' heart for a long time not to retreat. The corrupt bureaucratic system would lead to the brutal assassination from each official, which had been demonstrated in the plot that Dima witnessed and almost was killed in a dirt thing that the female Mayor shirked her responsibility by killing the head of architecture department and the head of fire department, who were the victim of political struggle.Finally, the bottom of the people's ignorance and insensitivity lead the audience to despair and chilling, who are the real ""The Fool"". In the dark of the community, the money right was first. Their children still like them, continue to curl up in the dangerous building to die. But the people living in such a bad situation, it is not only because of officials, but also their inaction Generally, the dangerous building, Numbness of the ignorant people and the brutal bureaucracy who escaped responsibility in this film, while there is also the kindness and courage of Dima, proves that Russia's society currently has too many dark sides which in China can be occurred."
