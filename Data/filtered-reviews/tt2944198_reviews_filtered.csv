" Gash
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,2,"Absolute, boring gash. Don't bother. Sorry, my review is too short. So, again, absolute, boring gash. Don't bother."
" A loosely based true story
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,6,"Backcountry is the type of film where early dumb decisions come back to haunt people later.It was hard to enjoy this film because it does move rather slow. However, the build-up is worth it. But there is not enough story to make this film memorable.The film is worth watching once."
" Scary
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,10,Here's a lesson for all who plan to hike: Do not listen to arrogant people who mock you or belittle your efforts when you use preventive measures in a unknown wooded area or ANY HIKING adventure. Be careful.
" Creepy!
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,7,Realy Nice movie its so exiting never go tho the forestðŸ˜„ðŸŒ²
" In summary: husband is a clinical idiot
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,4,"In fact - all the problems in this film are made by the husband's totally idiotic actions. Who is jealous more than necessary, who ignores the signs on the road, who does not take the map into a dense large forest, who... there is a lot more you know, but I can't to write it here. This film deserves ONE with a minus, but I gave a little higher rating just for its visual and relatively normal acting. The plot is incredibly idiotic and sucked from the finger by the fact that the author of the film made this husband a clinical idiot. That's all."
" not too bad for a trhiller but there is a difference between true story and (inspired from a true story)
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,6,"SPOILERSeverything is a clichÃ©, get lost, scary stranger, weird noise, darkness etc... the acting is okay, the ambiences is good kind of scary but like i said this is a thriller i know i a lot of people who would be scared to go camping after that movie.I do a lot of hiking and you never meet freaks like that..seriously hikers are usually friendly person.
and the bear.. oh my gosh... i mean specially the couple had every opportunities to handle the situation even for a bear in PREDATOR mode the SAD TRUE STORY behind this is the wife been attacked and died from her injury (Bleeding to death)
so this is just a thriller inspired from it, sadly that kind of movies will make people even more afraid of the unknowns, strangers and animals..."
" Unbelievably stupid...
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,3,Unfortunately It's one of these movies were the protagonists are morons and make dumb decisions for the sake of the plot. Pretty disappointed
" Do not go into the wilderness unprepared
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,5,"I did not review the plot beforehand. It's much better when you don't read anything and just watch the movie based on a title, and then comment.Someone going into the wilderness should have a flare gun, a darts gun or a big knife for protection - in some countries even a real gun if alllowed by law, something at least, some kind of weapon. Someone should have a cell phone that can make an emergency dial even when there is no network. Someone should have a map. Someone should know better than to wonder off the paths. Someone should not go into the wilderness off-season when there are no people around. This is just common sense. Our progatonists missed all that. And that is why I did not give the movie a higher rating.The main protagonist is allegedly experienced, has done that trail before quite a few times. That over-confidence came with a price.Never assume you are smarter than nature.
Never go into the wilderness unprepared.The movie is a bit slow at first, but picks up towards the end.
Overall, not the best survival movie out there, but not the worst. A good movie worth watching. It will not be a waste of time, but it could have been done much better."
" Bears, what bears?
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,5,"There is no mention of bears in this movie, a couple go hiking in bear country and u would expect the conversation to talk about bears even once, but no the director has it in his head don't nention the bogey man or bear in this case until he appears to kill... Nonsense movie"
" Edge of my seat. Loved it.
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,7,This film seems slow to start with but things get really good as the film progresses. Left me feeling mentallg scarred for a good hour after it finished.
" Rubbish
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,3,When it all turns out she died he survived what !! So nothing not even loosely based on the true story disappointing .
" Bear attack > bad editing
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,4,"I really disliked how it was filmed, that camera work was awful... and gosh, nothing happens for like a full hour and when the action actually starts you can barely appreciate it because of the editing. There's no point in having what i think was great gore if we can see it.... and after that ONE event, it's mostly just her running in the woods."
" Jaws but a Bear
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,2,"I'm going to jump right to it, this movie annoyed me. I appreciate the minimal approach, a cast of basically four people, very little in the way of special effects, just an attempt to allow atmosphere to do the work. The problem is, if you're going to go with a stripped down movie, the story or the acting have to be on point and it's just not here. There is so much plot convenience in this movie, so much done just to add tension. The lead male is an absolute moron in every possible way, he's about as much of sad sack loser as it gets. The woman gets to have a little more agency but it all feels so clunky and forced, especially when we introduce our mysterious stranger for... Reasons. They don't have a phone because... Reasons.They don't know where they are because... Stupid. I get that this was loosely based on real events, stuff like this can happen but good lord these two need a Darwin Award and to be ushered off the stage of life anyhow for just being so obnoxiously inept. Again, it's mostly him and this script but it is so pervasive it taints everything.That aside. The bear infuriates me. A quick google search will tell you that yes, rogue 'maneater' bears can happen, but it is so extremely rare that you might as well have a movie about a rogue thunder cloud that attacks someone with lightning multiple times. There's like 1 fatal bear attack in North America each year, so to have this bear not only be murderous but also be stalking and hunting them feels like a real stretch, one I couldn't get over.As far as survival thrillers go, this is one. I can't imagine a world where I'd ever recommend this to anyone Just don't watch it. There's not a single thing here worth checking this out. No redeeming factor, no singular point of intrigue. It's just a low performance movie."
" If they had Bear Grylls with them...........
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,7,"Not a bad effort of a film, lot's of very silly mistakes, but on the upside they didn't have Bear Grylls with them.......... they'd have both died if he had been"
" Pretty good!
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,6,"Nicely shot film,nature and all.Gifted actors,coll bear)Personally for me,there as too much relationship staff and way not enough of bear) Overall,very good one time watch."
" Slow!
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,4,"Wasn't impressed with this movie, lovely scenery but that was about it! The actors were ok but script lacked any depth. Very typical storyline with no surprises. End lacked closure also!"
" Bear-ly passable
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,3,"So the premise is decent enough, if not over played.
The acting is decent enough.
Sadly, there's one massive plothole.On the night they believe they've reached this mythical lake (that the total idiot of a boyfriend wanted to take his girl) and she goes off on one at him(rightly so in my opinion) she says something along the lines of 'we were meant to be going home tomorrow'. Now, if this is indeed the case, why did they hike so far? This was going to be their THIRD night of camping, meaning even if they were at the lake they'd still have another two nights camping before they even got back to their boat, never mind their car.So remember kids, if you only plan a 3 night camping trip, don't keep walking away from your transport home. Your boss/parents/school may not look too kindly on you being 4 days late..."
" Another movie trying to make men unmasculane ðŸ‘Ž
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,1,"Movie started good until I started catching similar patterns in movies of this era, idiot of boyfriend goes camping but don't have his stuff together, it depicts him a beta male. They have no weapons and can't defend themselves against the wilderness then towards end the woman is the one who takes charge....GTFO this will never happen in real life I dont care how feminine Hollywood attempts to make the man look.."
" Decent survival horror movie...!!!(Adult)
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,6,"A couple went to trip in middle of the forest but they face dangerous bear..After that both try to escape from there..
Usual story and concept but extraordinary photography...
must watchable...!!"
" Where's the Lake?
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,6,"I wish she would have stumbled upon the lake that he wanted to show her, it would have validated everything. She'd enjoy a moment of sheer beauty, mixed with reflection..."
" If you could only grab one thing during a bear attack...
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,6,"Pretty ho, hum - except for the bear attack! That was freaky as heck! Sort of ""Jaws"" like, 'cept with a big ol' bear! The rest is just a man and woman lost in the woods, making an amazing amount of ridiculous mistakes. I mean, what ONE item would you take from your tent if a bear attacked? Yeah, me neither. It's pretty in those woods, but not a whole lot to see."
" Carry on camping..... with a twist.
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,7,"A couple go off the beaten track in the glorious Canadian outback, and fall into the path of a savage predator.It's sadly based on a true story, so I'll keep my comments respectful. First of all, it's a very good film, it's packed with tension, it had me gripped, and on the edge of my seat.It seems that every single time people face peril from an animal in a movie it's a shark, the Black bear is a very different creature altogether, I always thought they were shy, what do I know.Missy Peregrym is the standout, I think she was excellent throughout. Strong special effects, very brutal.I politely ask why on Earth people visit such areas, beautiful, but containing danger.A gripping watch, 7/10."
" Good but not great
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,5,"I really wanted to like this film more than I did.
Why, well the woman is talking to a stranger and the boyfriend gets up all high and mighty, why do film makers make their main stars a##es?
The couple's fight and arguing got on ny nerves, this and the reason above are the reason I dropped some stars.
The bear attack was well done and very realistic.
A really good film with some brilliant scenes but please let's not have couples in films arguing all the time."
" Entertaining
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,7,"The movie is well produced.
The actors are unknown but they do an okay job.
All in all I can recommend this movie :-)"
" Not great not that bad, worth a watch.
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,6,"I might of rated this film 7 if they just hadn't shown the bear in the tent. Showing a big fake bear head detracted for me. Directors should not be afraid to just not show the creature. Especially if you build tension for the best part of an hour to deliver a paper bear head. I personally think Watching the reaction of someone being eaten by a bear would have sufficed.In terms of the premise of the film.
Now I'm no camping expert, but I'm pretty sure some major mistakes were made here. The biggest danger camping in the U.K. is probably stinging your unmentionables dropping the kids off to the pool. All you need is a doc leaf, maybe a bit of aloe Vera gel and bobs your uncle. Canada however appears to be a whole different kettle of fish.Mistake they made.
From my keen but amateur eye...If I took the missile camping and had a pretty unsettling experience with a chap claiming he lived out there, I'd take this as a foreboding sign of deliverance style rape or impending murder. This may have proven incorrect, but we'd have lived to tell the tail, they were all wrong for each other anyway.Mace type substance (I assume it was as the bear swiftly pissed off before returning for seconds) was only utilized after initial mauling of boyfriend. I just feel like it could have been used before the bear latched round the groin. Great story to tell the grand kids became no grand kids very fast. In marriage you get used to carrying resentments. But if they got through that experience both alive he'd have been feeling those phantom scrotum ""being eaten by a bear"" pains and would be proper miffed that the substance was deployed slightly earlier.Flare only utilized many hours after helicopter flew over. It was day time I know, but you'd still be tempted, rather than using it as a way to attract bears and serial killers at night.A more experienced camper took out a completely green novice, and determined that she would be totally ok in the event something happened to him. This is in a wilderness that contains giant human excavating beasts. This is without a knife or Fire arm (I'm no proponent for the right to bear arms. But if those bear arms are coming for my junk, I'm supplying some lead in return). No map, no phone, no compass or maybe as it's the 21st century, I don't know maybe a device that utilized satellites to tell you where you are. This however Might of made the film a bit boring, if they just navigated out based on the knowledge of the moss growing on the north side of trees. If that got mentioned it would have been a 5.I don't have experience of bears, but the bloody sock looked like a red rag to a... b ...bear to me. Like a restaurant staff offering tasters at the entrance, and an all you can eat buffet inside.Got to say though it does exciting. Will we survive tonight? Will I get eaten alive, lovely way to spend the weekend and some might even say he took the less painful route than marriage.Last thing to add is my Tag line for the film. ""Just when you thought humans were the most dangerous animal, it actually turned out to be bears, as they will literally eat you alive"""
" Frustrating
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,5,"I get the scene needs to be set, however, not an awful lot happens in the first hour other than a random meeting with a random guy who doesn't appear again until the end of the movie. What follows is a series of frustrating incidents with suspenseful music, a bit of slow mo and a feeling of ""Why would you do that?"".
Not an awful film just not a good one that doesn't take the viewer anywhere.
Also, just for giggles, check out the fake, bears head when it attacks the tent. Hilarious!!!"
" Painful to watch if you have any camping/wilderness knowledge
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,2,I'm shocked these characters are supposed to be Canadian. It hurt.
" Never without a rifle!
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,7,After watching this movie I thought it could be used by some company as an ad to promote the extensive use of mobile: never leave it in your car! Give a medal to the bear! Without its help it would have been a boring evening!
" Predictable, slow and so NOT horror
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,3,"I don't know If people get the definition of horror. This is NOT.
The movie is so predictable, in the first hour notihing is happening. Literally. The plot is about one couple who are going hiking and get attacked by a bear. Yes, that happend in the last 20 minutes. Boyfriend dies, she lives. The end. First 60 minutes of this movie it is basically the footage of these two going through the woods. And yes, what is the role of that guy in the beginning?
I would not recommend it."
" Shoot the cameraman!
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,4,"Pretty conventional movie about people getting lost in the woods, I rather enjoyed it. However cinematography was incredibly distracting and headache inducing - literally about 50% of this movie is out of focus. Just awful."
" Solid, but misleading!
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Great acting and intensity. Well directed as well. There's not much to not like about this movie except that it's NOT ""based on a true story"". So many movies try to pull you in with those labels. Either make the movie true to the story...or make it a stand alone fictional film! At best this movie can be labeled ""inspired by true events"". Which honestly most realistic movies can."
" Defenseless?
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,4,"Okay: This movie shows everything that one should NOT do when planning a wilderness camping trip. I know that it is based on a true story, with the genders reversed, but, who goes backcountry camping without a knife? It takes place in Canada, so a firearm is generally out of the question (one good reason not go wilderness camping in Canada). Like ""Open Water"", I was rooting for the animal, after a while."
" Dang
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Every so often you'll see a film where there's a scene that shocks people (Exorcist/FEAST/Deliverance), sometimes for better or for worse, and I think the attack scene here is a real candidate for being on the list (for better) it's extremely brutal, and...just gross. You feel very bad, and I'm a horror nut so not much gets to me, but this attack scene is just wild.I love Missy, she's a great actress...she's one of the people you'll see and recognize but won't know her name.The bear was an actual bear and not CGI (although I'd imagine some parts may have been) and it just all felt nicely out together.That's the good, the bad ISNT that bad...but the red herring early on in t he films felt was kind of unnecessary, because we all know going in what will happen.And the last quarter of the film I'll say does drag a bit...but overall it was a great story, a story of survival."
" I enjoyed it
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,7,"I thought it was a fun movie. It's not filled with bear fighting action like many were expecting, in fact it's kinda more about them being lost. The only things that irritate me is how dumb they are, specifically the boyfriend. He ignores the bear print early on, the eaten deer carcass, he shouts at what could possibly be a bear in the middle of the night yet he doesn't bother to sleep next to his axe or the bear spray? He opens up the tent to reveal a bear a few feet away and just keeps opening and reopening it, cmon man you're asking to get eaten. Then what's equally baffling is how he didn't think to bring a map or at least a compass, they have no idea where they are or even the general direction theyve been walking. Also I would have hoped the thing with the Irish guy would have went somewhere. It was enjoyable to watch but kind of random and pointless at the same time."
" Kind of Dumb
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,3,"There was a lot of things about this movie that I felt held it back from being a slightly better movie.The main characters were unbearable. The dialogue between them sucked, their personalities weren't really memorable or all that distinguishable, and their overall relationship dynamic sucked. Like, the girl invites this dude who's obviously into to eat dinner with her and her boyfriend, and then puts her boyfriend into an uncomfortable position when the weird dude keeps challenging her boyfriend and she just idly sits by while it happens? Or the dude coerces his obviously-scared girlfriend into staying on this remote camping trip just because he's been looking forward to it and he just KNOWS she'll love it? Come on.
I didn't really care about them at all throughout the movie, and that made it really hard to be into the big climax, or any part of the movie honestly.The storyline was meh. Most of the movie was following them around while the implication of a bear being nearby looms in the air (something Mr. Idiot keeps from his girlfriend until the middle of the movie), and then the climax happens and we follow the girlfriend as she struggles to survive. And then, for some reason, the day is saved by the jerk Irish guy from before, because... reasons. One thing I will give this movie is that it's pretty scary to be lost in the woods, and it did a pretty good job of showing just how confusing it can be to navigate your way around an area like that. Other than that, it was really more frustrating than anything to watch the characters make stupid mistakes that draws them closer and closer to the bear until the thing everyone is expecting finally happens.The cinematography was pretty meh, too. I wish I could've seen what was going on during the bear attack a little more clearly, because all I could see is the camera shaking, Alex screaming, Jenn screaming, some blood, and an occasional shot of the bear growling. The gore, though, was really good and very convincing.Don't expect too much from this film, but truthfully, you could either love it or hate it."
" Good Movie Well Worth Watching - Loosely Based On Real Life Bear Attack
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,8,"01/08/2020 - - REALITY NEWS REPORT - September 7, 2005 A black bear that may have learned to prey on humans killed a woman and injured her husband at a provincial park in northern Ontario. Jacqueline Perry and Mark Jordan, both 30, were attacked at a campsite in the provincial park about 80 kilometres north of Chapleau. Ontario Provincial Police said that while the bear was attacking Perry, her husband managed to stab it with a Swiss Army knife in a frantic effort to keep it from dragging his wife into the woods. Perry was a family doctor at Grandview Medical Centre in Cambridge, Ont. The couple were on a two-week holiday, camping and kayaking at a remote campsite when the black bear attacked. After fighting off the bear, the injured Jordan carried his wife to their kayak and started paddling to the nearest campsite. He yelled for help. A father and son from Pennsylvania heard him and took Perry into their boat."
" Well I won't be going hiking anytime soon...
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,7,Movie leaves you thinking about it long after it's over. Thought it was just going to be your average thriller movie. Wrong. So many variables add to the fear. Expect the unexpected.
" Sticks with you
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,8,"I might be biased because I lived in the woods and there were bears, so this hit home more than it probably would to those who've never experienced the woods.Doesn't have a whole lot of jump scares, but the slow character development helped me to become angry and helplessly upset when the boyfriend was slowly ripped apart by the bear. The fact that she didn't do anything, but in the moment grabbed the ring instead of the weapon, makes more sense that a real person would do that. You're terrified out of your mind, and you can't believe what you're seeing. The most plausible thing that flits across your mind in a split second before fleeing for your life after witnessing your boyfriend's innards displayed crudely would be to grab the ring that he was going to give to you (but you lost that chance because of the fight you had) and run. NOT to attack the HUGE psychotic bear.I guess I'm probably alone in feeling like that, but that was all she had left of him and I didn't take away that she was only wanting the diamond/money: she wanted to remember him if/when she survives. It was touching.Great movie to see if you have experience with woods and how terrifying bears can be when it's just you versus them."
" Real life facts
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,8,"I read in a lengthy article another the actual events the movie is based upon that it was actually the girl who was eaten and the boyfriend who dragged her up there was the one who survived.
Imagine having to live your entire life with The memories of how everything played out with his woman."
" Stupid movie with stupid actor
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,3,The bear is just a bait that make me wanna see this movie and it came out just for a few mins to snap on that stupid guy and he died...and the heroine just find the way out ...the end.THIS FILM IS RUBBISH!
" Great Movie
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,10,"It was a comedic tour de force. I laughed so hard I crapped my pants. Both characters were hysterically funny. The bear deserved an Oscar. He was beary funny. The final scenes were chock full of humor and good wholesome fun. A classic comedy vacation film like Vacation. Chevy Chase watch out, there's a new comedic genius."
" Shackycam
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,3,You don't make the movie more supspensefull by shaking the camera like a guy with 10 redbull inside. the shakycam in the running scenes was a joke. the acting and grading was good.
" Okay hmmm
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,2,"So the first half is basically a guy stupidly dragging along his girlfriend into the woods unprepared. He ignores obvious signs, reacts like a know it all to everything and ultimately leads to their unfortunate meeting with a bear.After the encounter we get lots of shaky camera as she makes her way out. It was boring, slow and I may have laughed a few times where it was supposed to be dramatic. Sucks that it happened to them but really makes you realize how using a map and using the items you bring could save you. Also how unsafe a thin plastic tent is against a bear. Who would have guessed?"
" A can of bear-mace
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,3,"Sprayed directly into the mouth of whoever was in charge of camera and lense-work, making them run off the production set; Might've have kept this, an otherwise perfectly OK movie, from being ruined by a combination of motion-sickness , vertigo, BPPV and eye-strain..ALL at the same time, from start to finish, no matter the current scene mood or environmentI'd never thought it possible that a movie about f..king hiking on foot trough woods could render me sea-sick!Sh.t camera work COMPLETELY ruined this movie."
" my notes
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,3,"There wasn't really much that i thought was bad about this movie. it was just boring and kind of pointless. very bland. (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
so many parts were ripped off from the revenant. obviously the bear scenes, but also certain shots like the view of the trees looking straight up."
" Good film although not fancy
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,9,"This is a very good, realistic & a sad film. Worth watching. The wild isn't Disneyland."
" Same old story but not as cheesy
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,5,I did enjoy the movie a lot but it is definitely a been there and done that film. For this kind of movie the acting was suprisingly well done along with the visual effects. Id say watch it in a rainy day
" This could have been done way better
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,5,"Took way too long to get to the climax. I think they should have encountered the bear towards the beginning of the film, though the suspense of the hints of the bear made me feel scopophilic, they could have cleaned up the storyline a lot more than they did.
Also, the tension between the couple and the Irishman was kind of unnecessary? Why did they need him in the story? Could they not have done more?
But I do have to props the director for his filmography, his fast cutting and visual distortion was brilliant. Plot wise, not so much."
" The bear should have eaten the cameraman
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,2,Never have I watched a movie like this and actually begun to root for the bear. Just wanted to get it over with. Stupidity is no replacement for suspense. The camera motion is so distracting. Apparently in an attempt to be artistic and show the disorientation after the bear attack. Skip this one unless you have a penchant for lsd.
" BEST BEAR MOVIE EVERRRRR
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,10,"Best bear scenes since The Edge (anthony hopkins eric baldwin)
Was awesome. Kept the suspense. Very realistic.
The bear is just wicked mon.
Definte date nite movie. Your chick will love it.
I watched it twice.
Underscored. But
People have no taste.
Ten DG's"
" A much appreciated debutant movie
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,8,"A movie beautifully picturised in a magnificent place. This will take you to the realities of some aspects of our life which we outright ignore because of over-confidence, inquisitiveness and enthusiasm. And eventually, it becomes deadly. Although it's a debutant movie which is actually depicting great efforts but there is always some scope of improvement. I must say the use of camera should have been much better as at certain points, the image has been blurred where it shouldn't be. The pace of the movie from the outset is ridiculously high and therefore, it becomes irritating at times. But overall, it really inculcated a sense of fear in my mind and I overtly enjoyed it."
" Stupid
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,2,"A stupid story of a stupid couple.
The camerawork is really annoying."
" Not the best movie ever...
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,7,"Not the best movie ever, but I find it really good, because I like this type of movies. The acting from Alex was in some situation really bad but, the movie keeps you your attention the whole time :)"
" Incredible highlight scene
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,8,"Not so much a spoiler but cluey movie Forres could catch my drift...
An arrogant male adult forgoes the use of a map in favour of his own instinctual pride.
A costly mistake. Yeah yeah yeah, we know how that plays out, but Back Country is powered with the intensity a highlight scene really needs to harness, and it delivers well.
So while this film is predictable in its core plot, I could not prepare myself quickly enough for the horror that unfolded.
The dissatisfaction for Back Country is the length of the remainder of the film after the highlight scene. That's the risk taken with having the whole film invested in one scene; the intensity is too early for the film to end with any kind of climax, just a success story."
" Have any of you ever seen a bear? Or been in the forest?
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,2,"Be honest with me, please.Listen, I can give a pass to characters making horribly stupid decisions. City girl doesn't know basic survival tips, alright, whatever, it's a horror movie. But the bear just... wasn't a bear.It's like the writer went, ""Hm, black bears, they're like sharks but on land, right?"" No, Mr. MacDonald. No they are not. I grew up in said 'backcountry' and I promise you, bears are basically big strong raccoons. They dig through your garbage and sometimes get in your pool. If you walk outside or just bang on your window and make some noise there is a significant chance it'll be scared off like a stray cat.But listen, here's the kicker: not only was this bear's traits replaced with those of a particularly angry tiger shark, it also ignored the things that actually do make a black bear scary. Like the fact that they can run at 30 mph (48 kph). And that they can climb trees like a dang monkey.I get that animals' scary factors are exaggerated for the sake of cinema. But man, at least Jaws was decently believable as a big shark. This bear wasn't dramaticized, it was just... blatantly, wildly, STUNNINGLY incorrect.I gave it a 2/10 because I guess it looked pretty enough, and the actors gave it their best. But boy oh boy, aesthetics and a good old college try are not enough to save you, Mr. MacDonald. At this point, nothing could ever be enough."
" Thrilling!
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Ok, Alex the boyfriend is one of the dumbest hikers ever and this is low budget. It's got Missy Peregrym in it. That's a great reason to watch it right there. It kept my interest the entire time. Wicked suspenseful! There's an erie atmosphere for the whole film. Others reviewed this before the CBS TV show FBI and there were some bad reviews. I'm not saying they would've reviewed it differently. Just saying I watched it to mainly see Missy 4-5 years before FBI. Glad I did. It's a little gorey at times and has a very gorey scene, but well worth the watch. The Canadian scenery is awesome. Being a hiker I could really appreciate it. Love the way Missy fights for her life and to get back to civilization. The abrupt ending was cool!"
" Bad acting, bad camera work, frustrating story
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,2,"I only write reviews if a movie is really good, or really bad...unfortunately this flic is the later. The characters continued stupidity is the only thing that brings emotion to this poorly made movie. The jumpy camera work along with terrible sound/music is headache inducing. The acting (by both main characters) is unbelievable at best. It's the kind of movie that you keep checking to see how much longer till it's over."
" A good survival film
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,8,"It said inspired by true events, it didn't say it was a true event.
It was quite good.
Both of the main characters in this reflected what could of been real characters.
The boy friends complacency is predictable which gives the film credibility.
The animosity from the boy friend to the Irish guy was credible but woe full.
The girl naivety was also believable but forgivable.
I was glad to see him play his final part in the film.The two partners made some pretty silly choices but what else do you do when you have a bear tracking you?"
" Lost-in-the-woods-and-menaced-by-nature Indie
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,7,"A young couple from the big city (Jeff Roop & Missy Peregrym) goes hiking & camping at a Provincial Park in the wilderness and find themselves lost and harassed by primal perils, human and animal. Eric Balfour is on hand as a dubious Irish outdoors guide.Written/directed by Adam MacDonald, ""Backcountry"" (2014) was inspired by the true story of Mark Jordan & Jacqueline Perry and their encounter with a man-eating bear in the wilds of Missinaibi Lake Provincial Park, North of Chapleau, Ontario, in 2005.Peregrym is reminiscent of Hilary Swank while Roop brings to mind a younger, less goofy Ray Romano. The movie's basically a low-rent meshing of survival-in-the-woods flicks like ""Deliverance"" (1972) and ""The Edge"" (1997). If you're in the mood for this kind of flick, ""Backcountry"" is pretty well done for an Indie. Sometimes the acting by the protagonists is questionable, but it's all-around serviceable and occasionally very good. The attack sequence & gore are excellent for such a low budget film.Some viewers have questioned the inclusion of the suspicious woodsman in the first act, but it corresponds to story structure ""rules"" in any type of suspense yarn, which is: When things slow down, bring in some kind of conflict, particularly in the first act. In other words, to encourage a viewer to keep watching give him/her something near the beginning: conflict, trouble, fear, violence.I was honestly bored with the movie up until Brad (the guide) was introduced, which ultimately leads to confrontation. This relatively gripping sequence perked up my attention and encouraged me to keep watching. It's WHY the writer/director included it, along with it being a challenge to Alex' competency, not to mention a red herring.The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot at Restoule Provincial Park and nearby Powassan, Ontario (just south of North Bay), as well as Caddy Lake, Manitoba; I'm assuming the city sequence was shot in Toronto.GRADE: B/B-"
" Was good until..
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,5,"The movie was very good. The acting felt genuine and I felt a sense of hopelessness the entire movie for our Main protagonist. I felt enveloped because it was based on a true story, but after finishing the film I learn that the movie drifted way off course from the actual events. The movie is a solid 6-7, but lost points because of the inaccuracies from the actual events."
" Beary Ok
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,5,"If you can get past the annoyance of stupidity than this movie is a pass. Knowing the direction this movie was to go found me pretty irritated by the little things that could have changed how it all unfolded. It was a slow burn but I did find it entertaining. I wouldn't watch it again, but if you're into animal-scare movies, give it a shot.. Plus, it's based on a true story, and that in itself is pretty frightening."
" They both deserved to be eaten
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,3,"I'll watch almost any movie set in the woods, that's how I came across this one. This movie is a great example of how a small cast can still successfully pull off the idiot plot. From the time the couple touches down in their hiking grounds they start making unreasonably stupid decisions considering any level of outdoor common sense. They continue to do what you'd expect when assuming stupid decisions will be made by them and naively misunderstand situations and put themselves in harms way over and over. I feel like this movie is made for city people who've never been in the woods and would believe that you could get helplessly lost on a two day hike and be anything other than completely inept. The only satisfying part is that the guy gave that bear a meal, as my title says they both deserved to get eaten."
" I can't with this movie
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,1,It was too long and boring I was waiting for it to be over !!!!
" Cautionary tale rings true
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,7,"I've actually seen documentaries relating instances of bear attack that are almost exactly as this movie plays out. I actually looked at the bonus features to find out if the movie was based on fact. It's a beautifully shot movie, nature is everywhere and, of the forest, one gets a real sense of the damp, the cold, the spookiness, and the awesome beauty. And I get the themes the creators aimed for, the survival instinct coming to the fore, finding inner strength. But the other more dominant dynamic is the relationship of the couple, and I get what the creators are trying to portray, and they do a great job. If you like movies with very honest intentions about ordinary contemporary people and their ups and downs and how they evolve with being out of their comfort zone or unforeseen circumstance, (alas such is life!), then I'm sure this confident exploration will not disappoint. For me, with a title like Backcountry, I wanted more. More disasters, disasters coming earlier in the picture, more tension, and, call me spoilt, but I think we needed more of the bear."
" Heck, bears are scary, who knew.
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,3,"This is not a bad film, but nor is it good. I'm not spoiling by saying it's a movie about some people, and bears. Bad things happen. Utterly predictable. Go watch Rogue and be really scared. This won't do it. The only scary development is not pursued.
Nice scenery for a bit though.Forgettable. But not terrible. Like I said, go watch Rogue."
" Horribly gory with stupid characters
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,4,This movie upset me. Humans are at the top of the food chain not because of our strength but because we have brains. The characters didn't use theirs. I enjoyed it at the beginning. The sinister appearance of the alpha male. The woods could be beautiful at times. The friction between the two characters was believable. It went well with their youth and lack of wisdom from life experiences. But the fact that they were as helpless as a deer because they had potential weapons nearby but didn't keep them close or didn't use them at all. I would have stabbed that bear in the eye with the burning flare. I would have had that ax with me to stay safe. She did NOTHING while her boyfriend was mauled.I don't know how the true story went or if this was an accurate representation. I did stupid stuff in my 20's. Maybe this is accurate. Maybe the point is about how young people don't see the world for how dangerous it can be. They only survive if they learn.
" I was going to give it three stars
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,5,"The first hour of this film is almost painful to watch - and not in a good way. All four of the characters (that's right, four characters total) are highly unlikable - the worst type of uncaring, jealous boyfriend; your typical 30-something suburban white girlfriend; a creepy, perv-type of intrusive woodland dude; and even the park ranger is shady.Backcountry focuses on this couple, and what this couple does is have run-of-the-mill couple issues - arguments, jockeyings for power, occasional glimpses of affection... YAWN. Who wants to watch that for an hour?But then, something HAPPENS. S#!+ hits the fan. The gnarlist of events goes down, and is presented in an ultra-realistic, shocking way. Ten out of ten for the film from there forward. It's REALLY GOOD.I almost bumped it up to six stars for that redemption. But I can't quite forgive the creators for making me endure that first hour. Five is good. Five is appropriate."
" Terrible Terrible Terrible
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,1,"Backcountry is a terrible movie. The cinematography is extremely awful. The acting is incredibly corny. The writing and story is very un believable. Any real outdoorsman knows a bear is very low on the list of dangers when camping. You are more likely to catch giardia before even seeing a bear. Only city slicks will fall for this foolery. Definitely not going to watch pyewacket or any other project with your name attached to it, Adam."
" Suspense is good but the horror lacks constancy
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,6,"As straightforward tale about the dark side of nature - a man and his girlfriend being stalked by a black bear in remote woodland. The film has intensity and the scenes of horror are startling. It works well as a drama about a relationship breakdown, once based on trust. So, it comes as a disappointment when it foreshadows too early."
" Worth the watch
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,6,"Backcountry starts out a bit slow. And the chemistry between the two leads leaves you a bit wanting. The interaction between the male lead and the guide that comes for dinner is a bit awkward. The camera work with the blurring is way too excessive
On the good side the female lead is very good when she is alone. The make up is amazing. The storyline is pretty good also"
" Very Good
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed this movie for the most past. I love that it was based on a true story (not for the poor couple it was based on) because it really brings it home and lures me into believing it could happen to anyone. As someone who enjoys back country hiking and camping, this movie really made me consider what items I bring on my next trip.I thought the acting was great and I liked the pace of the movie considering it was based on a true story.What I absolutely hated was the camera work... it's like they were going for the 'artist' feel of shaky unsteadiness with voyeuristic angles but I found it just distracting more often than not. Fortunately, it was minor negative in an otherwise very good movie."
" Winnie The Pooh wild for this one
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,6,A much better film before the bear stuff. Tense but overall it amounts to nothing.
" When can i go :)))
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,7,"This movie has a lot of very suspenseful scenes where your sitting there like omg and just were waiting for whats going to happen next.its a really cool story and it leaves you watching and just really wondering what this couple is going to do. 
It might of been better if it was longer and they went more in depth on characters and maybe some more scenes on before they got lost. It was also really cool the way they showed how the girl was in shock after what happened to her boyfriend. probably my favorite scene of the movie"
" Based on a TRUE STORY
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,10,"Many of the reviews are on how the film/plot went away from slasher/scary/horror. Seriously people, this is REAL LIFE and based on a true storym so You don't see all the drama you are hoping to see - lord can't anyone read?"
" Worthwhile attempt for an indie film.
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,6,"Being someone that lives and does backcountry camping where this was filmed, I have to say, it's a little far fetched from actual reality.I've encountered bears, and they don't just go out of their way to bother you. Also, random guys don't just stand around in the woods, and if they did, why would you even invite them to join your outting?I believe this film is targeting what some of us like to call, city-ots (city idiots), who tend to shy them selves away from the Canadian adventure because they have drowned inside the concrete jungle.Not sure what I was expecting from this but, it's definitely lacking in depth. They could've spent a bit more time and effort in developing a plot, or maybe even spend more time out there in the actual backcountry before they decided to film this.The gore was okay to say the least, but camping isn't really about getting ripped apart by bears. But I guess if you're one of those city-ots that brings that attitude out into the woods, you got it coming to you."
" THIS IS NOT BAD
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,7,The real gory part started towards the end of the movie. kept me at the edge of my seat but i could predict the ending.
" Hmmm...
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,7,"I've never written a review in my life, but I had to voice my frustration.
This is a really atmospheric movie, with likeable characters and a fair amount of suspense.
It's definitely worth watching...BUT...what drove me crazy was the ridiculous camera movement. My guess is, in an attempt to be arty and perhaps to give a first person perspective of the terror of being alone and hunted in the woods, the camera shakes and sweeps all over the place. Annoying and pointless!! Movie makers, PLEASE stop doing this!"
" Could have been good
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,5,"The start out had a positive feeling. Like I was about to see what seemed like indie trash, but may actually be a complete delight. 
As soon as they have the camp encounter it all goes downhill from there. 
There really were some great opportunities in this movie to be interesting and genuine. But sadly it ended up just being a poorly crafted survival movie, with all the trademarks of a bad 80s horror. 
This was nominated for an editing award. 
Really?????
Plus the ending completely invalidates the whole film. 
Basically a nothing film that could have been really good."
" Not the most realistic
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,3,"If a bear is stalking you and you are in your tent (and you have bear spray with you) why would you close up the tent as it approaches so that if it comes thru the tent and you need to use the bear spray everyone gets a full blast of pepper spray in the enclosed tent? ""Lets wait until the bear comes inside our tent before we use the spray, cuz that'll work!"". That's what this character does and it just ruins the building suspense. Theres such tension building, and then that happens and you think to yourself ""oh come on!!!"". They didn't even have the bear spray in hand when they knew the bear was just outside! You wait until the bear tears thru the zippered up tent to look for the bear spray? Instead of blasting it thru the opening as it's coming towards the tent, he zips the tent up so that if the pepper spray is used, everyone is getting it. After using it once the woman drops it and can't find it, while her boyfriend gets dragged outside and destroyed. Who would stay inside while a loved one is being attacked when you have bear spray? Just very hard to believe that people would behave that way (unless they really are that stupid- then they'd both deserve to be eaten). That scene just totally ruined a decent build up until that point."
" Could have been better! May have a good plot, but characters are so dumb!
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,5,"This movie I swear after the guy gets killed. It became so stupid. The guy knew there was a bear. You don't leave a weapon out of reach when you know the bear is nearby. You use the spray as soon as the bear enters the tent not after he starts feasting on your boyfriend. This would have been better if they fought the bear. You take the sleeping bag and shove it in the bears face. When a bear drags your boyfriend out. You run and start stabbing it. You don't wait till it's enjoying your boyfriend. this movie pissed me off so much. No wonder the Revanent was so much better! There's too many scenes that drag on and just the camera just stays focus on the characters faces. You don't continue a hike when your injure your foot. A tour guide that's knows the area should have known about the bear and gave them weapons or should have said if your not back here at a certain day I'm coming to find you guys. Sorry it had a good plot, but the stupidity in the characters just made me hate this movie!"
" Terrible and Predictable
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,1,"Typical B rating horror movie, two idiots that put themselves in harms way with nature."
" Pretty Rough
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,7,"This was a solid couple against the elements movie. The acting was decent and while you can see that it is low budget, it never felt cheesy. Not bad at all."
" artistic license, i guess
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,3,"""based on a true story"" is really a stretch in this case.
in the actual events, Jacqueline (Jenn) was attacked by the bear and Mark (Alex) threw himself onto the bear, trying to stab it with his jack knife, trying to get it of his wife, then proceeded to pick her up and carry her out, despite severely bleeding himself.instead of telling the story of a loyal, loving husband, the producers turned it into ""man stupid, woman saves"" feminist drivel, which is incredibly disrespectful imho."
" Predictable but good.
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,6,"The movie is your typical couple goes into the woods...couple gets lost....couple experiences bad stuff. Who gets out alive? I enjoyed their bravery to use a real bear in the movie. I'm sure it was difficult to work with. Plus having a lower budget the computer effects wouldn't have been the same. I really appreciated the artistic camera angles and forshadowing. It puts you in the state of mind for the next scene and prepares you for what you are to be focusing on. If you like suspense this movie has it. If you're not into movies that are laid out from the beginning, you might want to move on. But I always suggest to give it a chance."
" aw mang, give it a miss
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,2,"The beginning is promising, the premise is awesome. But the bear attack was hilarious. Like they cut out a pic of a bear in ms paint and had it moving back and forth lol. 
The bf's acting is not good. The lady really holds it together. Random stuff in the plot is meaningless and leads nowhere like the gore-toe and creepy woods man - who happens to be coming to the rescue in the end. The ranger giving them trouble at the start too, like what was that all about?
anyway give it a miss my guys, its a bit of a laugh but too slow to be worth waiting for it."
" Bone-chilling!
",2018-06-20 00:00:00,6,"Incredible first feature film by director Adam MacDonald. The acting is so good and natural I can almost see what they're thinking and feeling! Since there are only two main actors in the film, this is an important feature. And Jeff and Missy really are that good! I felt so nervous for them at times!! The film is very well done and despite the small cast, it never gets dull or boring. It is exciting, thrilling and nerve-wrecking from beginning to end."
" Near Perfect Horror
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,8,"This is how you make good horror. Character driven, good acting, rising tension, limited but devastating violence. 6.0 average? Horror fans are dumb."
" Must watch nature survival feature
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,7,"This is a good film about a bunch of campers who get lost in the woods and end up being stalked by a bear. I was surprised by everything: the acting, atmosphere and production values, everything except the plot which was pretty bare but for a film of this kind it isn't a problem. Backcountry is a film that deserves an audience. (Must watch nature survival feature)"
" Good but not too much
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,6,"Well, it is nice to think about our works, our minds, sometimes jealous. Cause i feel bad about someone, i choose wrong way or maybe kill myself!! Love is a great feeling, do not destroy it with our thoughts.
People usually say go to nature to be free, free from modern life, free from works, minds, to make fun, but whom scapes to woods must think right. There is an important rule in jungle. If you do not obey, you will make problems for yourself and your family. 
So i suggest you watch this film to understand psychology problems. Acting, screenplay, directing were good. I think special effects are not good enough, could be better, so we fear more, cinematography could be better.
Have fun."
" Wasted Potential
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,5,"First off i really wanted to like this film. I liked the story concept and that it was ""SUPPOSED"" to be based on a true story. which i prefer. The movie did have a decent atmosphere to it but had too many faults that ruined it. Overall all i can really say to summarize this film is,what a waste of potential! The budget did not ruin it, the cinematography did not ruin it, the actors did not ruin it ,the films length did not ruin it, for me it was the writing and straying too far from the actual real life event that totally ruined this film,. If you have nothing else to watch then give it a go just do not expect much."
" Good, but...
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,5,"Movie had intense moments and fair character development. Special effects were pretty good. Why the writer chose to portray him as a complete dumbass that got himself killed is beyond me. He actually wrestled this bear to save his girlfriend. He actually managed to fight off the bear and carry her back to the kayak. Unfortunately, she died from blood loss along the way. He was a hero, braver than most. The writer made him look like a complete waste of space.Shame on the writer for making this story into a ""women rule, men drool"" scenario. He did everything he could to save her and got 300+ stitches in the process. I will not be recommending this movie to anyone because of this."
" THIS IS THE WAY
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,5,"If you happen to peak at the cover while looking at the title, you know it is about an encounter with a bear, that is not going to be pretty. Alex (Jeff Roop) and his girlfriend Jenn (Missy Peregrym) go camping late in the season on a trail he knew as a kid. He doesn't need a map so guess where this goes. It is just a matter of time before our couple who don't know how to play dead, encounter a bear.Now the question of who survives and who doesn't is the only mystery. I was once told you don't have to be the fastest person when running away from a bear, you just can't be the slowest (pushing someone down and tripping are fouls to consider). Rape whistles are not really effective, but if that is all you got...I'm sure some people who are falling flap their arms too.Of course our couple can't just run into a bear. It has to be introduced slowly to build the tension. The encounter was more like a shot of a circus bear yawning with a dubbed roar then show some blood. It was low budget graphic. Not exciting.It is a fair film. I wish they had created a better couple instead of a boring woman and a sad sack.Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Male butt nudity."
" Don't Back Away from ""Backcountry""
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,7,"Missy Peregrym is my new heroine. The fetching Canadian actress is a flat-out bad ass as she struggles against the Ontario wilderness and a human hunting bear in ""Backcountry"". Loosely based on a true story, Peregrym's character and her boyfriend (Jeff Roop, who also impresses) actually switch circumstances in this gripping interpretation of grisly events by Writer/Director Adam MacDonald. You'll please pardon the pun."
" 7 star
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,7,She's a pretty girl :) The movie was good. But the last 1/4 seemed rushed in the writing idk could have been a little better in the last 1/4 from when they got attacked to the end was a 5star and the first 3/4 was a 7star
" Not As Advertised
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,4,"Overrated, and misrepresented. Note that ""Horror"" and ""Thriller"" are included in the ""Genre"" section of IMDb for this film. This is no horror story, and not much of a thriller. These mis-categorizations could be the reason for the many bad reviews. Simply put, this film is ""not as advertised."""
" Very good movie until...
",2018-04-06 00:00:00,5,"Up until the last few moments, I was ready to give this movie an 8-star rating. Having seen the end, however, i just can't do that. I even feel that a mere 3-star deduction is highly generous. Why? Because I feel cheated. Not only as a movie buff, but also as a man (and I'm not ashamed to say it). Obvious spoilers ahead.I chose to watch this movie to have a break from all the supernatural / run-of-the-mill thriller-horrors out there. I was glad to have found something that is (loosely) inspired by actual events and isn't filled with shallow teenagers acting annoyingly dumb during the first half hour, until things get going at last (I'm usually happy when they start getting offed one by one). In this movie, we witness the ordeal suffered by a man and his girlfriend while in the woods, and we are made to sympathize with them whenever things take an unpleasant turn. First, the girlfriend makes the mistake of talking to a sleazebag and kindly invites him to stay for dinner - the guy, who says he works as a tourist guide, then proceeds to taunt, humiliate and threaten her boyfriend (however subtly), before provoking him in front of her by picking up her panties and making her take them from him with a smirk on his face. I do not think there's a guy in his right state of mind who would not feel repulsed by such behavior. Luckily, the jerk soon leaves and the movie gets straight to the point, as the couple lose their way and end up in the midst of a sea of trees. It does not take long for a huge black bear to show up and begin hunting them. The boyfriend gets massacred quite gruesomely and the girlfriend wanders through the woods, trying to escape. In the end, she uses the last bits of her strength to crawl towards a group of people preparing to enter the woods themselves. Yes, they were tourists, of course. One of them, a young girl, notices the girlfriend and attracts the others' attention to her presence. And guess who turns around and dashes to save her in slow-motion, like the hero that he is (not!)? Our favorite sleazebag tourist guide, obviously!I'll be honest. I found this movie truly engrossing, and I genuinely felt for both the boyfriend and the girlfriend. I can therefore only applaud the film-makers for having achieved that, but would also love to bash their heads in for presenting us with an ending that is not only counterproductive, but even insulting to anyone that sympathizes with the two main characters. It makes me sick!"
" For People Who Complain About Stupid Characters
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,7,"I see quite a lot of comments from folks criticizing this movie for it's stupid characters and how their dumb actions only help get them into trouble - this seems to be the main reason for some of the negative reviews. Umm, have you guys paid attention to real life? People do stupid things all the time. It's not necessarily something that, when it happens in a movie, makes the movie less believable.Yes, the main characters did make some questionable choices but those can be explained pretty easily (Alex's ego explains what he does, and shock explains some of Jenn's actions and inactions). Yup, it's that simple and plenty believable because it happens in real life all the time.I thought this was a pretty good movie, that takes a simple premise and manages to create quite a bit of tension all while feeling pretty realistic.Not spectacular, but a solid outdoors thriller that scores 7/10. Kind of held back by how simple the premise was and that it never tried to be more than this. But like someone said in another review, it's based on a true story and it appears restraint was exercised to limit it to that (more or less)."
" Camping with Laurel and Hardy
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,5,"I found the movie highly entertaining. Not scary at all.
My wife and I watched this and laughed through most of it. As experienced campers and outdoors experienced, we just shook our heads at the gross lack of common sense and basic skills. A rookie tenderfoot would not have made the same mistakes. Their actions were simply not credible."
" Meh
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,6,"The first half of the movie is phenomenal. Tension, atmosphere, it's all a pretty good setup. You can kind of tell where things are going as the characters make some dumb choices along the way, but you're still interested. Maybe I'm being hard on them because I have outdoorsman experience, and I know just how stupid a lot of their actions are. But it was all very well-crafted, well-shot, well-directed, and well-acted.
The second half? Meh. It went from clever, psychological horror to mindless gorefest in the blink of an eye. I guess this sudden shift of time was supposed to be some shocking movie moment, but really I just went ""oh, it's this type of movie now? Ok then."" And honestly, the movie it set itself up to be in the first half was far superior. Then you're here thinking, ""well, since we've decided to be a gorefest, let's just enjoy a super violent finale!"" And you'll be disappointed because the ending they go with is so underwhelming. It's like it tried to go back to the psychological thriller it set up in the first place. Just pick a tone! You want to be an atmosphere piece or you want to show people getting graphically ripped apart by bears? Because if you want to be an atmosphere piece, you can't get off on over-the-top bear maulings, and if you want to be an evil bear movie, you have to give us a gory finale. It tried to do too much and is just a forgettable survival film we've all seen before. With a random scene of a bear eating someone alive."
" Vastly Over-Rated
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,3,"So, yes, this is based - very, very loosely - on a true story. A couple was camping in a remote provincial park in northern Ontario and they were attacked by a predatory black bear. The story in the movie is reversed. In the true story, the woman is killed and the man escapes; in this movie the man is killed and the woman escapes. It would be interesting to know why they reversed that, but whatever the reason they did. I watched this because it was based on a true story, and because every now and then I don't mind watching this kind of movie. But ""Backcountry"" disappointed me. To me, it seems vastly over-rated.The primary problem I had with this was the relationship between Alex and Jenn (Jeff Roop and Missy Peregrym.) The movie starts with them going on a backwoods camping trip. He wants to go; she doesn't, but she goes along. Alex does a lot of stupid things apparently trying to impress Jenn. ""I know my way. I don't need no stinkin' map. I'm not gonna turn back just because we both know there's a wild animal stalking us and I know (even if she doesn't) that it's a bear. I'm not gonna admit that I have no freakin' clue where we are."" Why does he feel this need to impress her? It makes it feel as if they haven't been together all that long. Alex seems insecure with Jenn. Sure, he's a landscaper and she's a lawyer. But later on we find out that they must have been together for a while, because this camping trip is Alex's plan for how to propose to her. OK. The relationship just didn't hit home with me, and in all honesty I didn't sense a whole lot of chemistry between Roop and Peregrym.Setting aside my confusion and disinterest about the relationship, there's also the problem that the movie for the most part is dull. Some call it ""suspenseful."" Seriously? Why? I mean - for the most part, why? Yeah. We know there's a bear around, but we have to go through about half the movie before we actually see it and the actual attack on Alex lasts for about two minutes. It's graphic and bloody - but then it's over. Jenn has to escape and, yeah, the bear is chasing her - but, frankly, we don't see much of the bear chasing her, and when we do the bear's heart didn't really seem to be in the chase. The bear probably would have preferred a nap after snacking on Alex, I suppose. But we had to spend most of the second half of the movie watching Jenn run - and most often we had no real sense if the bear was actually chasing her anyway.Then there was the weird decision to include Brad (Eric Balfour.) Jenn encountered Brad while Alex was looking for wood. Jenn asks Brad (a total stranger she meets in the backcountry) to stay for dinner. And - yeah - Brad's a little weird. You know this movie is about a bear attack, but ... a stranger? In the backcountry? With a knife - which was made clear? There has to be something there, right? Well, no. They have dinner, Brad pees in front of them, has a wee bit of a tense conversation with Alex - then, g'bye. At least, until the very last scene when he's the one who stumbles upon Jenn when she finally makes it out. (Which I somehow knew was going to happen.) I didn't get the point of adding Brad to the story.A truly over-rated movie. (3/10)"
" Average
",2018-01-13 00:00:00,3,"I very much enjoy outdoor, adventurous movies. I was excited when I stumbled on this movie and the premise of it, even more so that is was based on true events.There is not much of a character build up for either, just boyfriend and girlfriend, nothing more about that, which is okay but for the movie length and very little happening more of that could have been portrayed.It is literally just them walking in the woods for the first 45-50 minutes if not a little more. You begin to get glimpses of the bear at this time, but nothing more than a bloody toe and/or why the bear is chasing them. The confrontation is short, abrupt and essentially just in your face with out much of a draw out.The early on confrontation with the 2nd male character is strange as well, has no part or meaning to the story, somewhat silly. Then at the end it turns out that that person is actually a guide? Yet somehow early on in the confrontation with the couple he is a creepy prick, which doesn't really fit for a guide.The movie with the little plot, character arc could easily have been 30-40 minutes without many drawn out filler time. I would not recommend the film for anyone."
" Perversion of a true story
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,3,"IrishThe true story: a married couple enter the woods where the wife is attacked by a bear. The husband tries to fight the bear off, stabbing it ~10 times. He sustains heavy injuries, but his wife takes the brunt of the attack. He carries her to a small boat and gets them to safety, but it's sadly too late for his wife.
The movie: Dumbass boyfriend gets lost in the woods. A handsome Irishman threatens his masculinity so he acts like a jackass to his girlfriend, who calls him out on it. She goes on a rant about how much of a stupid loser he is and then he proposes to her. They are attacked by a bear and the man is killed while the woman does nothing. She runs away while her fiancÃ©e gets eaten. When she makes it back to safety the handsome Irish guy is there to comfort her.
A true story about a couple struggling to survive and a man trying to save his wife is turned into a movie about a dumb loser and his ""bad ass"" girlfriend. I wouldn't have been upset if it weren't for the movie being ""based on a true story"" while having nothing in common with the actual event other than having a guy and a girl in the woods"
" Blah.
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,3,I'd be shocked if the writers/directors of this have ever ventured into backcountry themselves. The black bear is already a poor choice as attacks from them are extremely rare and you are encouraged to fight back if attacked. The couple starts a campfire and immediately leave it unattended. It sustains the unoriginal feeling throughout and provides no real reward for sticking through the slow parts. Save your time and go backpacking yourself.
" A Campers Worst Nightmare
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,7,I watched this movie as it was loosely based on a true story. I have never seen the lead actors in anything before so I wasn't expecting an academy award performance. A nice couple out for a camping adventure that could have been a romantic getaway had the man given more thought in preparing for a back woods adventure. His intentions were good but he didn't plan for any disasters. This is where most people fail in making sure that they are prepared for anything that can happen. The guide they meet on their first night seemed creepy so we are led to believe that he might have dark plans for this couple. The acting and cinematography are on par with many big budget films. Considering how few actors were in this movie the pace and foreboding music kept me on the edge of my seat. My husband & I went camping at Mt. Rainier in Washington State. We were in our early twenties and just like most young couples we were out to just enjoy the beautiful State Park. Fortunately I had been camping for many years & knew some of the do's & don't's. Our first night we had a nice dinner by the campfire and put the coolers a safe distance from the tent. We had a beetle convertible & figured that our coolers would be safer outside the car rather than inside. The coolers had latches that were difficult to open. In the middle of the night I thought I heard some heavy breathing & I woke my husband up to tell him but he didn't think it was anything to worry about. Minutes later I could not only hear load breathing but I smelled something really foul and I figured it was a bear so we just stayed quiet as the bear went past our tent. He went straight for our coolers which he could get open so he started throwing them against trees. This continued for what seemed like hours and then it stopped. In the morning when we came out of the tent the scene was surreal as there was food strewn all over and birds were now attacking the remnants. Both coolers were destroyed. We were told that a black bear had attacked several campsites and had been caught. We packed our stuff and went to a hotel. That was the last time I ever went camping. I now carry emergency equipment in my car along with a first aid kit. No one ever thinks that something horrible or terrifying is going to happen to them ....they are the ones that have the least chance of survival.
" The Wrong Movie
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,3,"This movie is absolute bullshit, and I'll tell you why. I don't care if it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, let alone Toronto...when you say based on a true story and then I go online and I find it was loosely based AND THEN I read the ACTUAL account of what happened and find that NONE of it was real...I have to say as a reviewer I'm thoroughly disgusted. Number one, a bear will not attack twice like that,especially after being sprayed with bear spray. Look it up. Second, in real life, the young bear was aggressive and attacked once dragging his wife off while he tried to save her. THIS would have made SUCH a better story...Think about HIM, having to see this bullshit movie which actually demonizes the husband who did everything he could to save her...What in the world? Such bad taste. It might be OK if it were like a B-list horror film, but this premiered at Toronto...high profile. I expected SO much more. Embarrassing. It's a good movie, but it's the wrong movie."
" Spoilers follow ...
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,7,"A young couple Alex and Jenn (Jeff Roop and Missy Peregrym, turning in excellent performances) decide to backpack through the Canadian forests. They are sprightly, funny and highly likable. So much so that when they are joined by a third, Brad (Eric Balfour), he is immediately unwelcome, no matter how friendly he seems to be. And friendly he is, though there's no denying he has a darker side, which occasionally manifests in their conversations. His appearance some way into the film makes us pretty sure we'll see him again later Â… The other player here is Nicholas Campbell who is great in the small role of the grouchy Ranger-on-the-make.Likable though Alex seems, it is difficult not to resent him when he 'reasonably' insists they continue their trek despite strange noises at night and other unnerving occurrences â€“ we, the audience, know Jenn is bound to be right in wanting to go home, and Alex's foolhardy refusal to take a map guarantees trouble.In fact, the more we get to know Alex, the less likable he becomes. When he reveals his bullheadedness extends also to relieving Jenn of her mobile phone and leaving it in the car, and then succeeds in getting them both lost, our sympathies lie 100% with his partner. Of course, being lost with no way of communication with the outside world is integral to stories of this nature, and here is made entirely believable due to Alex's need to prove himself by turning down any offers of help. This allows Jenn to move centre stage and salvage a situation that descends from Very Bad to Even Worse, when they unknowingly wander into black bear country and become of great interest to a large, predatory killer. When Alex is frantically looking for his axe to ward off an approaching bear, I commend Jenn for resisting the temptation to say, ""Maybe it's with my phone."" We wait a long time for the attacks to come, but when they do, they are expertly handled and very effective. And more gory than we expect. This is an extraordinary debut from writer/director Adam MacDonald and I hope he has a long a fruitful career, because this a film with only four cast members, is extremely easy to enjoy. It should be said, however, that the ending is slightly disappointing, although the atmospheric use of the incredible location â€“ crisp, taught camera angles; at one point, the swaying of the trees has an almost hallucinatory effect â€“ ease the shortcomings due to a lack of proper pay-off."
" Poor
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,3,"This movie could have been much better. Too much useless drama for most of the movie that had no anticlimax. I finally saw a bear after 3/4 of the movie was done. Suspense yes is good but this movie overused it. After I finally saw the bear, there were just 2-3 small encounters and the movie was over. Very disappointing for a movie rated 6"
" Feh
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,3,"A would be romantic camping trip goes wrong and leaves Missy Peregrym running for her life from a killer black bear.Everything in this movie goes to waste except Eric Balfour. He has one scene scene, but it is the only scene that conjures up any feelings of unrest.Peregrym is so bland and uncompelling, possibly because she knows how unimaginative a movie she is in, and cannot find a reason so summon any charm. There are a couple of good shots but for the most part the camera work is clumsy and amateurish with frequently annoying shifts in focus.If you wanna see a better survival film about a killer bear, try The Edge."
" This is NOT ""The Edge""--it's a lot more terrifying
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,5,"The main purpose of my review is simple. To warn people that if you're glad that Werner Herzog didn't play the audio tape of the killing of Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend in _Grizzly Man_, you may want to think twice about seeing this film. The bear attack is deadly and truly horrifying, and given that it is based on a true story (a couple attacked in Ontario by a predatory black bear), though in real life the woman died and the husband survived, it's hard to tell yourself ""it's just a movie."" I had to turn it off during the deadly attack--too much horror.As for the rest of the movie (since I saw over two thirds of it), I can confirm what a number of other reviewers said: that the characterizations are OK, but that both characters do a lot of stupid things that set up their situation--far more than their real life counterparts, whose only mistake was to camp in a relatively remote area of a Canadian provincial park. I live in an area where black bear sightings are not uncommon. Now that I know they can actually become predatory--not merely defensively aggressive--I'm feeling a lot less OK about my next hike. Jeesh!"
" Just okay
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,4,"This movie was just okay. I might have given it a 5 or 6 had it stayed even remotely close to the story it claims to be based on. Instead of staying anywhere close to the true story, this movie takes the guy, who in real life is awarded a medal for bravery for fighting off a bear with his bare hands and a Swiss army knife, and instead turns him into a bumbling idiot making every classic noob mistake possible.if you dismiss the idea it is based on a true story, it is just barely good enough to hold your interest."
" Under the limit, but acceptable for being honest!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,5,"I watched the entire film without knowing it was based on the real. Only on the later I came to know that and my stance has changed a bit. Because it's not always about the quality of the product, but something revealing truth is most important to me in films. It was honest and not following the blueprint of a similar kind was the advantage. Obviously it was a small budget B movie with unfamiliar cast.So while watching it, I thought why they (film characters) not doing like this, that. Because entertainment films should do that for its viewers to please, but its notion was not that. It was depicting the actual event. Well, most of the crucial scene with the beast was just acceptable due to the category of film it belongs. Can't afford graphics nor trained animal, but I appreciate the effort.Story wise, it takes time to come to the point. And then everything happens so fast before the end approach. Initially, the narration teases with a different kind of thriller, but after some developments, it accomplishes its mission. Like I said don't expect something like 'The Revenant'. This film is not for the recommendation, but trying it out on your own is not a bad idea.5/10"
" I guess I had my expectations high.
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,3,"So after finishing the movie, my guess is that the bear only has about 5min of screen time. Also, it doesn't show up until halfway through the film. The sketchy tour guide was completely out of place because they made him seem like some crazy lunatic and then never shows up again (well he makes a brief appearance at the end but doesn't serve anything to the story). The movie just didn't seem like it knew what it was doing. Lots of overly dramatic slow- motion sequences of just the girl walking, running, resting, etc. Characters were also completely idiotic. They even had bear spray! USE IT! Don't just spray it once and then call it a day. Don't waste your time."
" Wow. Just wow how bad this movie SUCKS!
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,1,"I honestly believe a Marxist feminist wrote or at least inspired this dreck. Basically the rest of this review is nothing but spoilers, hopefully to save people the time in their lives they would have otherwise wasted on this movie.Plot: 2 good-looking young adults go camping in a Canadian provincial park. The female is studying to be a lawyer, the male is going to form his own landscape company - yep, she will out earn this guy by far whose claim to fame is 'high-end landscaping', which I imagine is having a new mower. He brought her out here to experience what he has in his youth. Drama ensues.First, the male refuses a map of the park claiming he doesn't need it because he's been there a lot earlier in his life and knows it well. Secondly, because of the female's annoying habit of checking her smartphone, he leaves it unannounced in the car. You already know these 2 subtle clues means they're going to get lost.Second, the female shows she has a bear whistle around her neck, and then the male finds bear spray in her back and ties it around her waist, telling her she'll never need it. You already know these 2 subtle clues means that once they're lost, a bear will come after them.Then out of nowhere a creepy Irish Eric Balfour shows up with a string of trout, convinces them both to host a trout dinner, shows a huge hunting knife to both of them, insultingly demands potatoes to be served, pisses in front of them (his back was turned to them) and then menacingly confronts the male. He went out of his way to antagonize the male. Then, he NEVER shows up again in the movie until the very end. A huge red herring with no purpose whatsoever, unless it was to show how the male was a 'loser' (see below) for not directly confronting him.So the male who knows the area like the back of his hand gets them lost looking for a lake and the female blows up and claims he's 'always been a loser', after which he reveals he brought her on the trip to propose to her. Naturally her mood turns 180 degrees and claims she didn't mean what she said. Soon thereafter a black bear shows up and rips up the male, dragging him out of a tent, while the female retreats as the male tells her to run. She was bitten too but not severely.The rest of the movie: while the camera perpetually jogs up and down and every which-away the female scrambles to get away, pausing once to break her ankle. All the while she is deprived of food and water. Nonetheless, our plucky heroine manages inexplicably to find her way back to the canoe, the same canoe that was so heavy it broke her boyfriend's toe when he hauled it up out the lake, and she with a mangled arm and broken ankle has no trouble hauling it down to the lake and paddling to safety.And who notices her on the shore? Why, Eric Balfour of course, who is leading an eco-group as he explained creepily earlier. The movie ends here.So, both of the main males were either creepy and weird or a loser who mows lawns, won't reference a map and tossed away a cell phone.WTF was this idiocy? I was cheering for the beer to nail the female at the end, but inexplicably it stopped following her.What a waste of my time."
" Really wanted to like this movie...
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,1,"Started off alright, I liked the characters, decent production values... and I love outdoors and hiking. Then the writers went off the rails. I don't mind horror, but it has to be somewhat believable. The characters suddenly lose all common sense and animals start acting fake. I had to stop watching after the big scene... scanned the rest to confirm it was a total waste of a decent movie. Don't waste your time."
" Rank stupidity at its worst
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,3,"****Warning does contain plot spoilers****First and foremost, there's nothing scary about this movie other than a few, very brief moments of terror and intensity.Second, a couple spending a few days out in the wilderness is not a new movie story line.Third, all the actors were convincing in their roles. The movie was well made which is why I didn't render it a 1 or -1. Alex (Jeff Roop) is Jenn's (Missy Peregrym) boyfriend and Brad (Eric Balfour), a lone man who gives extended, off the map, deep woods tours.Fourth, and in the beginning, Jenn has no idea what a colossal idiot her boyfriend Alex is. For example, Alex proceeds to give Jenn a hard time for wanting to bring along defensive bear spray citing she won't need it because he believes there are no bears where their camping. Fifth, Alex decides to showcase his excellent land navigation skills by not bringing a map, and by getting them hopelessly lost. He felt his memory of past visits to the expansive wilderness their in was more than sufficient. Sixth, Jenn had a cell phone. Maybe they can use the cell phone's map app to determine their their location. Once again, nuclear engineer Alex took care of that by taking Jenn's cell from her without her knowledge or consent. Way to go Alex!Seventh, in the mist of all this dismal stupidity, along comes a man eating bear with a taste for human blood. Alex and Jenn are in a tent and see this monster coming. Does Jenn ready the bear spray? No! They sit their in the tent like a couple clowns waiting to be devoured!Eighth, Alex ends up getting devoured while Jenn sits in the tent and lets it happen while she still possesses the bear spray which she will later leave behind.Finally, the whole camping trip was orchestrated by Alex, the neurosurgeon who wanted to propose to Jenn. Once the bear enters the scene, the movie becomes extremely painful to watch due to the stupidity of Jenn and Alex. They were such idiots that I started rooting for the bear to end it."
