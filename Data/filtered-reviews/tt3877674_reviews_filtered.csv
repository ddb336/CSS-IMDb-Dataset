" Motherless goosebumps
",2021-04-12 00:00:00,6,"Way more ""funny strange"" than ""funny haha"" to me, and my son. Is man the only animal that enjoys slapstick comedy? La Bete Humaine on display, in a dilapidated mansion with secret chambers. Perhaps this is a surreal microscope view of our primitive drives, or a commentary on life without women. Or a vegetarian appetizer. Well, those are all long shots.I think it's just a peculiar story, that benefits from the steadfast pursuit of the absurd by its actors. Written and directed by Anders Thomas Jensen, who may share DNA in addition to a homeland with Hans Christian Andersen. Both surely delivered to loving parents by storks.For what it's worth, we watched it the day after ""International Sibling"" Day. Will a sequel be sponsored by 23 & Me?Creepiness kept at bay by a cheesy kookiness."
" Twisted insanity and dark humor
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,7,"I was really hooked throughout the film, the setting, the characters and the pure wickendness of the story is sublime! I am not entirely sure what this film is supposed to say, but for me: No matter how weird you are, you can be a family, related by blood or not... and even if your anchestors or parents did super bad and wicked things, they do not make you a bad person.
Bonus: I really loved the set design of Beelitz Heilstätten, where they shot the main mansion."
" This is one of the funniest movies Ive ever seen
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,10,"That is truly an understatement too.. Wife didnt appreciate it and ouldnt finish it.,.. and normally , the bizarre storylin would have me switching channels immediately.. BUT...and I'd like to attribute Mikkelson's role as why it entertained me so much... ( and OMG did it) but I have to admit.. ALL the pieces kept me in stitches.. the pace, the dialogue, just the SMART comedic portrayals omg its brilliant... Not to mention those idiot brothers... and the brother who is %18 chicken.. I can hardly hold a straight face when I look at him now... Just brilliant...Dont go looking for a storyline that makes sense..Its simply not there..this is a car crash on common sense... and thats also whats the magic.. Mikkelson tho..omg it takes a bit to figure out his character and the angle its coming from.. but once that journey begins its ON...lmao.. You dont know wether you hate the guy or love him to pieces... Hes a dirt bag, and a delite all in one... This movie is definitly one for the personal library!!"
" A completely Hilariously DISTURBING GEM!
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,9,"Ran across this movie by accident about a year ago. It's one of the most strange, disturbing, sad, hilarious and redeeming stories I've seen. You wouldn't think that there is any love in this story, but there is quite A LOT of love. The total absurdity of the brothers and their behaviors was 3 stooges worthy at times, horrifying at other times and surprisingly lovely as well. Mads Mikkelsen was absolutely wonderful and the main reason I watched this movie in the first place. I loved their story-time Bible readings, and the dinner plate scene, HILARIOUS!! If you have a taste for the bizarre and enjoy foreign films in the Dark Comedy/Drama genre give this a try. Every friend I recommended it to, just loves it. ;D"
" Absurdist movie that turns into an emotional gem
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,8,"From the start this movie is full of weird scenes and wonderfully funny. It is set in an old, rundown building, which creates a sense of loss. The main characters, five brothers, all behave in absurd ways; although this doesn't strike The viewer as being too odd, as practically all people in the movie are slightly weird.
So up to three quarters into the movie, this looks like a movie that is nonsensical, but then the plot deepened and the secret of the five brothers becomes apparent, and the entire tale starts to make sense.
Well made, great acting, a lovely experience."
" Great movie
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,8,This is typical dark Danish humor and I love it! It's definitely worth watching if you like dark humor.
" Probably the best 6/10 movie I've seen so far
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Humorous, a bit dark and dramatic. It has a quiet relaxing atmosphere with kind of increasing tension among the characters throughout the film."
" Jodorowski style
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,7,"Twisted, unreal, grotesque. I don't know if you can learn something from it, but will beat your brain cells well."
" Odd, funny, Danish Gothic horror
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,6,"In Anders Jensen's oddball film, two brother go to investigate their ancestry: they discover they have more (previously unknown) siblings, who live, both literally and figuratively, in a madhouse. What follows is a comedy that might be described as zany, but is also surreal and in places even thoughful, and a send-up of a gothic horror played with a sometimes straight face. The film's ability to make you laugh without breaking cover entirely is quite admirable; on the other hand, it does sometimes seem as if the director is using ""make things as odd as possible"" as his primary rationale. It's the kind of movie that one can enjoy every so often, perhaps, even if at times it feels almost like a sketch-show in alternative form."
" Surreal and fab
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,9,You know from the start this will be great. Some movies take a bit to get going but you know early on this one is going to be wierd with some strange outcomes. Subtitles are easy to read.
" Dark and twisted fun
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,8,"I love dark, dry, and twisted humor. I love that sense of humor that appears to only reside around the North Sea (and partially in Australia to my experience). English, Danish, German - they all have a very dark, harsh sense of humor though each slightly different. The Danish always add this pinch of quirkiness and perversion to it, the English usually revolve around awkwardness, and the Germans often make it so hard that laughter gets stuck in your throat (although they suck at bringing it on screen). Toss the Germans aside for now, because this movie is a celebration of both awkward English and quirky, perverted Danish dark humor. I love it. It's simply a pleasure to watch, probably the same way some people enjoy a classical concert of some of Bach's or whatever symphonies. Though heard a thousand times by different performers, it is always a pleasure aesthetically. Like eating your favorite food dish once again.What especially pleased me was the performance of Mads Mikkelsen. I've been told that comedy is the hardest discipline in acting. Not only he, who is much rather known for very proper drama, does it perfectly well, it took me a while to even recognize him, and that is always a sign of a great actor. It reminds me of Bryan Cranston comparing his roles in Breaking Bad to Malcolm in the Middle. Brilliant acting. And funny, ow, ow, ow.A film not more than knee deep but well worth watching for the pleasure."
" It only hurts when you laugh.
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,8,"This is dark comedy at its best. A macabre mix of Gothic squalor, perverted family values, hideously debased 'science' and above all, brutal but hilarious slapstick.Mads Mikkelsen's performance is outstanding but the entire cast is convincing, drawing you into their nightmare world.The setting is perfect, too – a crumbling mansion on a pancake-flat island possibly somewhere in the Kattegat and reached by a one-car ferry which only sails every few days.Despite the clowning, this film has greater depth which merits further viewing. The message is dark, satanic and disturbing – but we laugh at the pain."
" Individual in it's genre
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,8,"The director's work, the scenes and all of the technical stuff was just fine in my opinion; the movie has all the usual ups and downs, we get our catharsis at the right spot, and I think in a certain level the plot is expectable. Yet it caused one of the best movie experience for me so far in it's genre. And why? Through the movie I didn't get any side-thoughts but after the cast I replayed the plot in my mind and I had to see that it raises really deep questions and problems: family values, ethics in science, exclusion, discrimination.Later I also figured out that all of the brothers have the same personalities as the animals whom DNA inside theirs. Of course it's really easy to find it out afterwards, but still funny to rethink the whole movie in the sense of this fact!"
