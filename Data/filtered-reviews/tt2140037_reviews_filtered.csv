" Nothing happens for 90% of the time
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,3,"Boring western, most off all a romantic drama and lovestory. The last 10 minutes are okay , not the rest"
" Unattached
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,2,"The short to red dead redemption ii had more emotion than this. Bland, pointless characters with no connection."
" Jane (Natalie Portman)
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,10,"Favorite scene with Jane (Natalie Portman) -Being rescued by Dan after purchasing supplies at the General Store, and shooting and killing her assailant."
" Never lifts off
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,4,"It's not a 'bad' film, it's just not much of anything. Reading the production issues suggests the film had the potential to be much more before key people abandoned the project. The acting is fine. The look of the film is fine. Dialogue and editing fine. But that's just it, the film is 'fine'. Nothing to really to recommend it."
" Good Movie!!!
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,9,"This film was much better than I expected. It is worth watching this film, it has a talented cast with good performances."
" Should have been called Jane got a bomb
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,5,I don't mean to spoil the movie but blowing up all the bad guys and shooting them when they're on fire is sort of a deus ex machina ending.
" Lame PC Remake of Hannie Caulder
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,1,"First of all, the movie this reminds me of, wasn't that great either. Hannie Caulder with Raquel Welch (who didn't do tough in that that well) is similar without the PC crap attached to this. Natalie - the only time you ever did tough convincingly was as Matilda in The Professional. Matilda would slaughter Jane. I know Natalie blames Star Wars for ruining her career, but maybe it's really her poor choices of films to make - like this bland western. Even the supporting cast can't help this fragmented, fairly dull attempt at a western. Think I'll watch Open Range again to wash this out of my brain. (Annette Benning was fifty times tougher than Jane!)"
" A truly awful film
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,1,"Ridiculous plot, awful characters. Portman is completely unconvincing, showing she has not a clue how to hold or shoot a rifle. And what the hell is it with putting Australians to play Americans with cheesy accents? Is there a shortage of Americans who can do a Western? Just awful and an insult to the genre."
" Jane got a dud or maybe she is a dud
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,1,"It's an ok fluff piece of entertainment that has certain high points. The ending is fragmented and hurried which suggests certain amateurs got in and had their way. After seeing it, I thought how emasculated the skirt chasing male leads were and how capable and clever the female lead was ... and there it is ... Hollywood can't help itself with recent movies ... the subliminal feminist / woke / political agenda ... the production houses are as weak as water at times and they deserve getting low rankings every time."
" Very Impressed
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,10,"This movie is suited to people who like a complicated but entertaining plot. All the actors, even those with a bare few lines like Slow Jeremiah, turned in very competent performances and the leads worked as well as Padm√© and Obi-Wan did.The pyrotechnic booby trap, perhaps technically a bit dodgy, but an effective scene. I enjoyed it and gonna give lotsa brownie points."
" Not bad
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,6,Quite enjoyed this film but ruined by being shot in the dark in numerous scenes.This seem common in a lot of modern day movies
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,6,Good movie. nice story. great acting. it started off very slowly and dragged at times but I enjoyed it. emotionally powerful (1 viewing)
" Average Western
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,5,"As westerns go, it is a decent movie. However, I expected, or rather hoped for, a little more gunplay and gunfights. Instead it follows a pretty standard storyline with a big shootout in the end. What is a little bit different is that it got some elements of a mystery to it. Portman's character Jane and Edgerton's Dan clearly have a history together, there is tension there, although very little about it is known or revealed at the beginning. What clouds the picture is that Jane is married, with her husband lying dying, shot by the bandits hunting Jane. Why they hunt Jane is also unclear though. As Jane and Dan prepare for the inevitable attack they talk and more and more of the events leading up to the situation is revealed.It is an interesting story, which Portman and Edgerton delivers well. And it is a good movie. But, if you are expecting a movie with a little more action and gunplay, which the title lead me to believe, it also comes down lacking a little bit. It does have the final shootout, but is not as exiting as hoped. Too few exchanges and duels. More of a massive onslaught that forces Jane and Dan to take cover. No real suspense, as the battle tilts quickly in their favor.Some nice talent, with Portman and Edgerton leading the way. Ewan McGregor also does well as the leader of the gang hunting them.Certainly good enough to watch once if you like westerns. Too few new quality westerns are made nowadays, this is one of them. But it won't be mistaken for a modern classic."
" A Movie With History
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,6,"It's pretty widely known that this film has ""history"", that of the troubled variety. Losing 3 of your leading actors, as well as the director and cinematographer on the eve of shooting isn't desirable in any feature's shooting schedule. The movie that eventuates from that turbulent genesis is quite watchable, without being greatly compelling.The biggest question I want to ask, is what happened to the $25 million budget? This is just about as spare and as lean a western as you'll see, with no great set pieces and at least half the action centred around a single, somewhat ramshackle farm house. I'm just always fascinated by films in which you can't see where their budgets went and Jane Got a Gun is one of them.The movie has a thin storyline, but director Gavin O'Connor, does take the right decision to play out parts of the narrative in flashbacks. By doing this it allows him to enhance the story with a couple of reveals, that aren't so much twists, but do add to the depth of characters' back stories, enabling both us and other characters to see them in another light.Unfortunately, I can't say that O'Connor handles the action scenes in anything other than a very perfunctory fashion. Westerns are primarily action vehicles. The stage is set quite early in the second act for a rather large climactic shootout at Jane's above mentioned farm house. But when it finally arrives, the whole sequence is underwhelming to the extreme. It's almost as if O'Connor wanted to avoid getting his audience too excited. It's badly lit for a start and I'm just not really sure why it had to be shot at night any way. Then he only takes the perspective of Jane and her companions from inside the house. We rarely see their targets and instead have to withstand several minutes of imposed ""thrills,"" as they hide from external gunfire in a near pitch dark room. Wow!The performances are good, with an almost unrecognisable but underused Ewan McGregor as the chief villain and Natalie Portman, very convincing as the title character, who through necessity, comes to realise she can't always rely on the men in her life, to provide her future with any degree of security.However, considering the good cast and the relatively generous budget for a film of this nature, you are left wondering what sort of legacy original director Lynne Ramsay might have made with these resources and would it have been a more memorable production."
" Better than I was expecting
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,"I was not hearing good things about this movie but was surprised by how entertaining it was. The cast is pretty top notch, the acting is all pretty good. The story is typical when it comes to westerns. There is nothing special here but if you are like me and have watched just about everything, it is worth a gander."
" This picture has a legacy...touchs in forbidden subject!!
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,6,"It's seems one more modern western released in near past, but l realize that it has a hidden message with it, misleading think it with an average neo western as suppose to be, Portman put the subject on a slight way, in fact when the west was colonized by americans and built those small cities they needs a large portion of white slaves even mexicans too to ensure a carnal pleasure under so lonely places which l had heard somewhere, a non-linearity of the some many flashbacks confuse a bit the viewers, leaving the movie in a slow pace, the final scenes is hard to gulp, thus stay clear to be an average production with the great cast that won't bothered anyone!!Resume:First watch: 2019 / How many: 1 / Source: DVD / Rating: 6.75"
" Jane Got A Past, Too
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,7,"The thing about this movie is that you have to have some ""stick-to-it-iveness"" to see it through to the end and really appreciate the story. The first time I tried to watch it I failed. I gave up about halfway in. It had put me to sleep a couple of times and I just wasn't able to focus on it. It seemed overly slow-paced; it dragged. But there was something there. Something needed to be revealed. And that's the key. There is, indeed, something there. Jane (played by Natalie Portman) is actually a very interesting character, and her story is slowly (very slowly) revealed in a series of flashbacks. In the present, she's married to a man (Noah Emmericah) who was once an outlaw and is being hunted down by the outlaws he used to run with, and she has a five year old daughter. With her husband shot and wounded and the outlaws coming, she needs help, and she runs to Dan Frost (Joel Edgerton) - the man to whom she was once engaged, who by happy (perhaps too happy and therefore too contrived) just happens to live in town. Together, they take on the Bishop Boys.Jane's past is what makes this movie work. If you can wait for it to be revealed, it makes Jane a much more interesting and sympathetic character. Without giving anything essential away, let's just say that in the past she and Dan had a life and a future that was thrown into turmoil by the outbreak of the Civil War. The rest of the flashbacks stitch together what happened to both Jane and Dan and eventually do lead you up to an explanation of what's happening in the present. Her past is slowly revealed, so you have to be patient as you watch, but I thought (the second time I watched this) that it was worth the wait.If you go into this expecting a typical western full of gunfights, you will be disappointed. It really is more about how Jane's past led to the present, and there's really very little gunplay in this until the last 20 minutes or so of the movie. There were apparently a lot of production problems involved with this (cast changes, etc.) and there are some who might be evaluating the movie because of its production history rather than its actual quality. The sets are also fairly minimalistic. There's nothing really fancy about this movie. With a budget of about $25 million, it's fairly low budget compared to some of the well known movie released around the same time, and that does show in the sets, which are limited and bare. But the performances - especially by Portman and Edgerton) are very good. (7/10)"
" LEAVE THIS PISTOL AT HOME...!
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,1,"As we come to the inevitable conclusion of Jane Got a Gun, the overriding thought which permeates me brain is ""why""? Inherited by Gavin O'Connor (Warrior, Miracle) after the original director Andrea Arnold hightailed it to greener pastures, one wonders what was in this revisionist western storyline to attact all involved. Even 90's trash like Bad Girls had women doing something but this oater still eschews a woman needing a man to get the job done. Westerns from the 50's may've been simplistic but they laid the foundation of what this slight story can't get right. The stunt casting of Star Wars prequel actors Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor & Joel Edgerton (""Hello my name is Owen & this is my hetero-life mate Beru."") can't elevate the superficial tale from the terrain it came from. Skip it!"
" Rather disappointing
",2018-05-28 00:00:00,4,"JANE GOT A GUN is a disappointingly grungy western that goes through the motions without ever engaging the senses. It's another film that's full of flashbacks but unlike in, say, BRIMSTONE, these feel padded and drag the snail's pace down to a crawl. The film has a murky and digital look to it which I didn't care for and indeed it feels quite depressing. Natalie Portman is the erstwhile heroine but she ends up making way for Joel Edgerton's tough gunslinger for most of the film. The film builds and builds to a climax, but when it occurs it takes place in the dark so that you struggle to see what's going on. Altogether this is rather disappointing and certainly not the mini-epic I was hoping for."
" Dry
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,4,"Was looking forward do a decent western and sadly very disapointed.it starts of it seemed to me in riddles , you begin wondering how it came to the situation it does,its quite confusing andbi found it very dry.everything in the movie had been done before and it lacked atmosphere.i would actually class it as a barbara cartland novel rather than a western ,the main stars spend to much time looking over the past to make the present film intersting.after about an hour of reminissing we actually get to some action and then it seems the film is all over.also as a person who has shot pistols i find it very annoying when you have a looking down the barrel scene you can clearly see the gun is empty.anyway i cant tell you a lot more because there is nothing to tell ,in fact it was so dull i cant even remember the ending and i only saw it last night.no where near brutal enough for a western ,and an uninteresting story."

" I got two bullets left
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,6,"Bill Hammond (Noah Emmerich) with four bullet holes makes it back to his wife Jane (Natalie Portman,co-producer) and warns her the Bishop boys are coming. Jane tries to get help but her husband has a bounty on him. She eventually gets help from Dan Frost (Joel Edgerton) a man who she was once engaged. We know it is New Mexico 1871 and everything else is a mystery. Who are the Bishop boys? What is the history of this conflict? We are feed the information slowly getting half the story at about 30 minutes and the other half at about an hour.This is a fairly typical western. There is some shooting, killing, horses, and drama. I thought there was too much drama. Natalie Portman reminded me of Demi Moore, tough girl in her performance. Yes, Jane got a gun, but that wasn't overly significant to the tale. I think the author may have been influenced by the Aerosmith song, which didn't play during the closing credits either, but I couldn't help thinking about it. The mystery aspect and flashbacks ate up much of the movie as we awaited the final confrontation with over formula results.Guide: F-words. Implied rape. No nudity."
" Jane got a gun but she won't blow you away
",2017-11-14 00:00:00,6,"Jane got a gunThe performances by the leads in this movie allow it stand a little taller than your run of the mill western. Never the less this picture is just that, run of the mill, ordinary, nothing to write home about. The story of Jane (Natalie Portman) who asks for the help of her former lover to protect her shot up husband from some nasty men. It's a simple premise but not that well delivered. Ewan McGregor plays a convincing villain with what little screen time he has. As does a rather undernourished Boyd Holbrook. Joel Eggerton proves once again he's every bit the leading man but no amount of on screen talent can raise this movie above the norm. The whole picture seems rushed and as if many a scene was most likely left on the cutting room floor. This film runs lean at 1hr 38mins and you get the sense that there's been some meddling here and there. McGregor's underdeveloped character warrants this as does the flash back scenes which are merely inserted to help at least give the audience an inkling of what's gone on. Jane got a gun isn't a bad Western but in today's world where they are few and far between it hasn't much competition to compare it against."
" Good Movie - Should be Jane Gets Sweet Revenge
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,9,"No ""may"" about it. It does contain spoilers.This is an exceptional movie in the western genre for this age. As many westerns made in the last 20 years, Jane Got a Gun has a fair amount of modern thought and is a bit anachronistic. But if westerns were made to reflect the way of life for the time period they are set, we'd have a lot of very boring movies. Probably a lot fewer westerns too because reality just does not excite the audience. And, while we like this very watchable movie with a share of violence befitting the story, it did fail badly in its effort to convince us that it ever could have happened this way. It fails the effort to be a revisionist western in the likes of the 1992 movie Unforgiven. Neither Jane Ballard-Hammond nor Dan Frost match the careful presentation of retired gunman William Munny. And general continuity in the movie is absent - but that is understood to be the case these days because directors today are not learning even what continuity is let along taught to consistently maintain continuity properly. So we don't need reality. We need movies that shoot up houses to the point that they let more light in then keep out. Forget the fact that that in this movie, when the outlaw gang attacks the house late at night, when it was so dark about 20 bad guys get right up to the fence without being seen. Even a full moon on a cloudless sky would have provided enough light to see that danger. But, there was absolutely no light source outside the house. Interior views of the house show that it had many holes in the walls because of light shining through each bullet hole from outside. This light could only be seen from inside. It was necessary to skip reality in order create the impression that the outlaws had turned the house into a giant sieve. Even as Dan shoots at the outlaws on the roof from inside the house, suddenly light is visible from outside. The effect of the mysterious light lasted until long after the explosion of the kerosene filled jars in the trenches. Again, lets forget that even shooting a gasoline tank will not likely cause it to explode and that kerosene is less likely to be triggered into an explosion with a gun shot. Oh Well, it was an excellent tactic and once prepared I waited in anticipation to see what would happen with the booby trapped trenches. Spartacus did it better though. Because it is a fanciful flashback of a romantic happening, it does not matter the hot air balloon, was tethered and when untied and three adults in the basket, it floated effortlessly into the air without any source or means to heat the air inside the envelop which actually causes a hot air balloon to rise. Such air ships need constant or at least very frequent repetitions of some heat source to cause them to fly. In truth, all they can do is float along with the wind go up when the air in the balloon is hotter than the air outside the balloon. And when it is not, gravity takes over and pulls them back to earth. But Hollywood and other filmmakers seem oblivious to these basic facts and principals of aviation. This film actually falls much closer to being like Wild Wild West movies with their wild wild western imagination of what might be could be and in the movie is. When you need a romantic kiss in the clouds, you don't need reality or even correct representation of balloon flight. Besides, nobody knows how Superman manages to fly do they?So what? It does not spoil the core of the story which is really not about how Jane got a gun and how or where she got it unless the gun she got is her old love Dan Frost. It is actually about getting her revenge on the man - Bishop - who made her preform the duties of a whore, led her to think her daughter (Mary) was dead after promising ""passage and protection"" to a new destination and town. It is about how she had a man, lost that man, got another man by default, and lost that man, and got her first man again. Within the first 6 minutes of the movie we know that 'Ham' is a goner. He was simply a knight in ratty armor who played a protective role until he gets in deep trouble. Then the Prince comes in riding on his white horse. At least that one they got right - the white horse. How about the white horse, at the end of the movie? It's tied behind the wagon bringing the dead outlaws' bodies to town to collect the massive reward suddenly became a brown horse for Jane to ride back to the waiting wagon with the bags and bags of reward money. The white horse is found with the waiting Prince and wagon as Jane rides in and joins them. The horses must have this planned or something? I really love this movie with excitement coming from a means beyond our imagination. It's a great story about ""getting sweet revenge"" and eventually we see the Prince, his Lady and two daughters riding off into where the sun sets with"
" Quality 'Old School' Western
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,8,"Why this has such low ratings is beyond me. Yes, it's slow. Yes, there's a lot of flashbacks. But these are tropes of the genre and as such the film is simply being true to its roots. At 1hr 38m it's actually pretty succinct for a Western. Personally I found the way the flashbacks revealed the backstory of the characters engaging and played out at just the right pace. It's beautifully photographed (though Monument Valley has become something of a clich√© by now) and you can't really flaw the acting either.So, as a massive fan of the genre I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's perhaps a tad lightweight and the denouement wasn't as satisfying as I was expecting but overall - well worth your time."
" Jane needs a lot of help
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,6,"""Unforgiven"" meets ""True Women."" The worst thing about this movie is the title. The implication is that, once her husband went down, Jane grabbed a gun and did a lot of her own fighting, but as shown by the altercation with the cretin in the back alley, she needed more help even though she was packing heat. The movie can't decide if it's mainly Jane's story, or that of Jane and her former fianc√©, Dan Frost, teaming up to protect her wounded husband and defend their hardscrabble ranch against a band of demented desperados. Considering the trouble this film went through in its opening days of production, with the director quitting and new actors having to take roles when others dropped out, you can see why Natalie Portman (who co-produced it) had such a sour expression most of the time."
" Anyone who gave this movie a negative review is a moron.
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,7,"It's a fine movie. One of the best I've seen in a while. Natalie Portman's performance is impeccable. She's not only one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, she's also the best actress. Ewen McGregor plays a subtly sleazy bad guy that almost makes my skin crawl, if only because of his confidence and surety that he will never face justice. All the other actors carry their parts well. The story is simple, but reads true. Nice cinematography, and dialogue. There's really not much to criticize. I guess most people just over-think things too much these days, rather than just relaxing and enjoying a nicely done film."
" Uninteresting and boring throughout.
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,4,"Jane searches for help with her ex-lover, because her now husband is being searched by a gang led by John Bishop.Gavin O'Connor, the director of among others ""Warrior"" and ""The Accountant"", both of which were great films, ""Warriors"" being one of his best films. This film however I found to be just fine. There really wasn't any substance to it in all aspects, which also means that the visual storytelling wasn't good. It wasn't bad either though. There just wasn't anything interesting going on and every shot just looked bland. The color grading was dull and the shot composition just followed the basic rules. The camera didn't move in interesting manners and there were no further meanings with how some shots were represented, even though this would've been so, if the director had had more time. I've read on the trivia of this website that only one day after the previous director had been fired, this one was, which means that Gavin O'Connor didn't really have the time to put his creative stamp on to the film and that was pretty notable, because his other films did look good, in all the things that i've just mentioned, so it's a shame that this film could've been better if O'Connor only had gotten more time. There are plenty of westerns that came out not so long ago that did look visually good (Slow West, Django Unchained...), each of which had their own creativity put into them, which wasn't the case with this film. There was so much room for creativity, but there wasn't any used. But that wasn't the only flaw this film has, there are multiple, and those I'll discus now. I most of the time like movies, where the protagonist has to defend their house, but in this one they just followed the clich√©s of every one of those films. The only thing that differs this film from the rest is that in this one the prepping scenes were done badly and the build up fell flat, because of numerous reasons, but those'll be discussed in the second to last paragraph. The editing was fine, but the pacing was dreading and slow and at times this was also done too quick; it never really hit the good notes. The soundtrack was also just fine, nothing special, some songs were good and others weren't. The acting was just fine. Natlie Portman, normally a good actress, was the worst one of this cast. Her accent was inconsistent and overall she only did an OK job. In the emotional scenes she cried and such, but it never felt like those feelings were true. Joel Edgerton, gives as usual a good performance and Ewan McGregor as well was good, even though we didn't get to see a lot of him. In my opinion he gave the best performance of the film, in comparison to Natalie Portman. Between Joel Edgerton and Natalie Portman there wasn't really any on screen chemistry. Noah Emmerich was good as Bill Hammond, even though he didn't really get his chance to shine. The kid actors were fine, but nothing special, nonetheless pretty good for kids. The screenplay was mediocre. The story overall sounded interesting to me, but the execution of it turned out to be bad. The dialogue was cheesy and clich√©d with nothing interesting. It wouldn't have mattered if I'd skipped some scenes, because nothing happens. The characters were badly developed and don't go through any development, but they try to do this, but the use of flashbacks. Those flashback scenes, however, were badly written, whereby those were only boring and on top of that, they didn't add anything to the characters! I didn't care for any of them, which only made the movie more boring than it already was. The writers also tried to put up this love triangle, in which they failed miserably as well. Then how was the villain? Well, equally as bad as the other characters. He had no character surrounding him, and due to this I couldn't find myself understanding him. The build up to the finale is also not good, like I've just said indirectly. But the finale was also very anticlimactic. It only goes on for a couple of minutes, and with the whole film building up to that particular moment I expected something big, but I was left with a boring, short action scene. And another thing I want to say is that the title of the film is really bad. The title at least insinuate that Jane's a badass, but time and time again this statement gets proved wrong. In the end ""Jane got a Gun"" was a not so good film, which is quite surprising, hence it's directed by Gavin O'Connor. Visualyly this film looked dull and uninteresting and those two words describe the film very well: dull and uninteresting. The film was boring throughout and the characters were badly written.4.5/10"
" Them Bishop boys are coming for you? You don't need a gunslinger. You need a goddamn regiment.
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,7,"Jane Got a Gun is directed by Gavin O'Connor and collectively written by Brian Duffield, Anthony Tambakis and Joel Edgerton. It stars Natalie Portman, Joel Edgerton, Ewan McGregor, Noah Emmerich, Boyd Holbrook and Rodrigo Santoro. Music is by Marcello De Francisci and Lisa Gerrard and cinematography is by Mandy Walker.Jane Hammond (Portman) has to turn to her ex lover, Dan Frost (Edgerton), for help when it's revealed that the notorious Bishop gang are heading her way in search of her husband Bill (Emmerich).It's going to be one of those films more talked about for what it could have been than what it is. Changes in production staff were unbound, from director, writer, photographer and some big name cast changes, it was a production blighted and destined to be on a loser. It hasn't helped that with it being a slow paced character based picture, and a Western at that, the market for a fan base was already running low on potential supporters. So what we left with?It undoubtedly is one for hard core Western fans only, it's hard to envisage newcomers entering into the genre for the first time, perhaps lured by the casting of Portman, being won over to the point of seeking out other classic Westerns of past and present. Yet it's got a lot going for it, because if you have the want, then it may just take a second viewing to fully absorb and enjoy. At its core it's a straight Oater of redemption, opportunities waylaid by fate, and of course a good old good versus bad axis. Relying on a flashback structure to set up the character dynamics, it can get a bit disorientating at times, hence the shout out for a second viewing. However, it may not be the perfect way to build the principal characters, but they are worth the investment for there's a big emotional pull there.Having laid the foundation for the first two thirds of the pic, we shift to good old honest violence, for siege read backs against the wall, and not without invention, in fact there's much resourcefulness on show, with Jane at times very much leading the way. The last third pays off handsomely, even if there's the (arguably) inevitable sugar coated candy to swallow as part of the final deal. Cast are dandy and turning in perfs of note, though it needed more of McGregor's John Bishop, because with what little he gets he does make a villainous mark.It looks terrific, Walker's photography bringing to mind the genre work of Roger Deakins, with the New Mexico locations blistering in their beauty, and while the sound mix for dialogue exchanges is a little poor, the musical score is thumping in its tonal appreciations. It's tricky to recommend with confidence even to Western fans, especially in a year when ""Jane"" had to compete with the more rambunctious Magificent Seven reboot, but give it a chance if you liked something like Slow West, and you may just be pleasantly surprised. 7/10"
" A unremarkable yet somewhat entertaining Western.
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,5,"Jane Got a Gun (2016) is an unremarkable yet somewhat entertaining Western. I usually will not mention the production processes behind movies, but this one has notoriously become an abysmal one. The original director dropped out, multiple stars came and went, and the entire release date was pushed back for two entire years. The whole situation would make it seem like this film is a hot mess, but it actually wasn't. It may not necessarily be a wholesome watch, but there are a surprising amount of redeemable qualities. The acting was really solid, the direction was firm, and some of the shots were breathtaking. Many parts felt flat, the action scenes were underwhelming and the plot was forgettable at best. I went in here expecting a strong female-based role, but even that fell flat. Though nothing here was truly terrible, there was nothing that drew me in. 'Jane Got a Gun' is truly run-of- the-mill, but the production disaster behind it should cement its place in cinema history."
" Jane Shoots and Misses
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,4,"With the history behind the troubled production and numerous delays for this film, I had prepared myself for the worst. While Jane Got a Gun isn't the trainwreck I expected it to be, it's still a snooze of a western that won't do any favors to reigniting a dead genre.The two things that helped keep me from falling asleep are the performances and the production. The cast actually does a great job despite having to work with weak material. The production also is really good here with some decent cinematography and captures a gritty version of the wild west that exhibits the dirtiness we don't always get to see in westerns.The big problem with the film is the characters. Despite a talented cast who is trying their best to work with what they have, they can't make these characters work. This is because the script provides barely any development to these characters aside from what is presented in several flashbacks to feel completely out-of-place and detached from the rest of film. Despite being the title character, Jane is giving almost nothing to do here and Joel Edgarton seems to be the only character is is bringing some life into this dull western. Combine this with a sluggish pace, there is almost nothing to invest in.As someone who want's to see more westerns in the mainstream, I really wanted to like Jane Got a Gun and somewhere in it there's a decent film, but it's trapped behind a poor script and weak direction. I honestly wonder how this film would've turned out if it hadn't faced so much trouble during it's production instead of the misfire we've got."
" Does an excellent job of showing harsh the old west could be.
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"This movie does a good job of showing how despicable some people were. There was little law and order so people often had to rely on home made justice.The outfits, guns, and buildings looked correct to me for the era being portrayed.The heroine and main character played by Natalie Portman was a very convincing frontier woman, I was impressed with her performance here. As much as I liked the Star Wars movies I never thought her role was convincing in those movies,I always felt she was ""acting"" but in this movie I was impressed. She really came across as a desperate woman faced with overwhelming odds doing her best to save her hunted husband and innocent child. She kept a cool head at a time when most women would be panicking.Some of the characters were down right crude and nasty. Shoot you just because they didn't like you. Or lie to you and end up forcing you into prostitution because they didn't care one whit about you. Yup, there really were people like that in the old west. They moved out there because they knew they had a better chance of doing their dirty work in the absence of law and order.Overall, this is a well acted movie. I thought Natalie really assumed the role here. She seemed genuine. She rode her horse well too, and manhandling a Colt Walker is no small task either.There is at least one good plot twist that I'm sure you will enjoy.I suppose there really are two stories going on in this movie but I'm not going to ruin it for anyone.I can recommend this to anyone who likes westerns."
" Poorly Written Cowboy Romance
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,3,"This movie feels so unfinished, lacking in plot and character development. Jane's relationship with Donovan feels somewhat forced, and it watches like a cheap cowboy romance. Characters are utterly unlikable, even something that starts with a good motivation lands somewhere else. What I liked, though, were some of the flashbacks; despite intensity of the present time story, the past one was much more interesting. This could've been interesting if it was made like one of those old epic sagas ('Far and Away'), with showing the details rather than just retelling them. Spanning it all in a day concept was an ultimate hit-and-miss. The happy ending was so perfectly made that I could not give this not a single star more. Overall, this movie may keep you entertained for a hour or two, but I would have difficult time recommending it."
