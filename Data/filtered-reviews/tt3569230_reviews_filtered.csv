" Should have a higher rating
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,10,"This is a good film, it's engaging and well produced. Emily Browning is underrated."
" Stylish, well made period piece...
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,10,"I thought this was a well made period piece and, of course, Tom Hardy is remarkable. It's a slice of a look into two Londoner East ender gangsters, not the whole picture obviously, but engaging piece of one.I loved the production design of this film, the way it's shot, the costumes, the soundtrack, the automobiles, all are used to create a recollection of a time and place, but it's Hardy that creates the psychological atmosphere of this movie, and the underlying tensions between the two characters he plays, the identical twin Kray brothers.Well worth watching if only to watch the loyalty and tensions between these singularly interesting brothers with their complex dualities."
" The usual movie about gansters of the average level
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,5,"The usual movie about gansters of the average level. The plot is simple and naive. Everything is executed at the average level, acting wishes the best. All movie is dragged on the shoulders by Tom Hardy. Also he does it perfectly. To win back two absolutely different persons on takoy level it is laudable."
" Dressed to impress
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,4,"Director/writer Brian Helgeland's ""Legend"" is one of the most elegant ways to waste your time, a dashing sprint on the surface of the mob underworld of the 1960s. Not a British ""Goodfellas"" by any means--if that's what you're asking--although Helgeland has the Scorsesian passion, too bad he lacks the chops to pull it off.The movie paces itself with default narration starting with words like ""It was time for the Krays to enter the secret history of the 1960s"" hyping excitement for what, in fact, the movie did not deliver. And by that, I don't mean presentation; having charming Tom Hardy into a double role, playing both Reggie Kray--the calculated, insightful and knowledgeable leader, and Ronnie Kray--his paranoid schizophrenic not so similar twin. But Hardy is not able to deliver more than aesthetic impressionability no matter how many times he raises one eye-brow as Reggie or stares into the abyss like Ronnie mostly due to the script which is not worried with details.Throughout the movie, we are constantly amazed with The Krays' power. But never once do we see them at work. Reggie's diplomatic skills are wasted on soap operas, and Ronnie's fearful persona, on childish escapades. One scene in a bar, has the twins cornered by a rival mob, but Ronnie's insanity is wasted on comic relief as he is angry that his brawlers brought knives instead of guns. It is a funny scene, nonetheless, and it goes to show just how foolhardily brave Ronnie is--not to mention insane.One other thing that Scorsese has up his sleeve that many underrate, is not his ability to create strong men--that's easy, but his ability to create even stronger women. Nothing as such is seen in Reggie's first-date-then-wife Frances, who has as bland of a personality as they come--I feel like Helgeland didn't even try here. She was so basic, in fact, that when the shocking surprise came close to the ending, I didn't even care. Stereotypes have a way of generating a catatonic response from the audience and as I looked around the room at the people I was watching the movie with, I got the feeling it worked here.While ""Legend"" might not work for more pretentious viewers like me, it is one of those movies that captures an impressionable audience. Despite taking place in a nightmarish world, it is dressed like a dream. Caveat emptor!"
" A Hardy Triumph
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,8,I loved it in spite of its flaws simply because Tom Hardy is just superb. The way he portrayed both twins is amazing. I would have preferred to see Frances given a bit more depth and the story around Jack the Hat explained better but I loved the movie nevertheless.
" Intriguing, hard and very realistic.
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,9,"I found this movie so realistic that I felt like I was in the movie myself.
It gave me a flashback to my my youth and early life when I was growing up as a gangster in Amsterdam.
A very good movie and a very recognisable movie for me.
Been there, seen it, done that....."
" There you are: A Collection of Cliches
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,3,"One of the worst movies of all time. I wonder how it has got even 6.9 on IMDB!First off, the plot is drifting along all the time and never really finds a center. Once it is about ruling London, then it's about the story of two brothers, one second later is about the relationship of Reggie and his wife, which was awfully sentimental, and the same thing goes on and on. Needless to mention that the stupid idea of having a rival for Krays was just a way to show some mediocre action scenes. There are numerous events happened in the movie which are of the same weaknesses. For example, what was that ridiculous quote at the end? Really?! Let me ask you a question: Can you make an entertaining movie by attaching some cliches to each other? The answer is a big NO.Speaking of the characters, despite the respect I have for Tom Hardy and his wasted performance in spite of being given terribly written characters with hazy backstories, the cast was sluggish. Impossible is it to describe how unconvincing and sappy they are and the performances they offer are an incoherent mess as after a while, the show is just making a fool out of you. No matter how Tom was good at his portrayal of the Kray brothers, the rest were nothing but miscast. That's the result of aiming to copy just some old mafia movies like Goodfellas. I have to admit that after a sequence of events, the ending was clearly spoiled to me as I knew exactly what was going to happen. That's the worst thing that could happen to a movie; to become PREDICTABLE.Getting into technical points, everything seemed so out of form. The cinematography doesn't really convey the atmosphere of a mafia movie (let's say the whole movie doesn't!) and the music is only an attempt to copy some Scorsese's styles. As I have already mentioned, Legend is a test to see what happens if you JUST copy essences of other masterpieces in a picture.Personally speaking, this mess smacks of trying to make a movie like Goodfellas. For the people who have rated high here, see this masterpiece and then tell your honest view about a REAL mafia movie. Now I realize why my teachers always insisted on NOT COPYING. To simply put, such a waste of time."
" Amazing start followed by terrible events then an awful ending
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,6,The starting 40 minutes of the film is amazing I thought I would give it 9 out of 10.But then Reggie got locked up and from there the film declined significantly.Reggie became a wife beater and ronnie got more crazy and ruined the club. And reggie's wife got addicted to drugs and killed herself. And the ending is just The icing on the cake.
" Slightly underwhelmed, but good none the less
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,7,"So I've been put off watching this for so long, because I'm not big on the idea of one actor playing multiple characters. But I will say that this works. Tom Hardy I thought was brilliant and watching this I really admired his acting.So why only 7/10? Well, if I could do halves i would go 7.5. However, I don't feel it's worthy of an 8 or higher and here's why.
The plot. It's a bit flat in areas and the reason being is that this film seems to centre around Reggie and Frances relationship and not the gritty gangster ways of London. Which I'll assume (it's why I watched) most people want to see. Not don't get me wrong you still get elements of it, but the film is heavily centred around the relationship, therefore you don't get enough.
I was just underwhelmed. Like I said it's a good film and definitely worth watching, it just could have been done better. And that's why I'm a little disappointed."
" A little convulated movie but Tom Hardy is a marvel of modern cinema.
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,8,"Gave 1 star extra for Hardy. The movie started out good, giving a good grip to the story and expectations were high.
But, somewhere the unnecessary character of Emily Browning derailred the story. Tom Hardy was convincing as both Reggie and Ronnie and the cinematography was good too.Every side character also played well but somewhere the story seemed repetitive, cold and rushed. Hardy was not wasted though, as some would think when a good actor is in a mediocre movie. He did his best or atleast did his best of what he could have done in a limited platform. Totally watchable.Cheers."
" Hardy superb, the film meh
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,6,"Crazy work from Hardy, good soundtrack. The rest is very mediocre"
" Just average
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,5,"I don't write reviews very often, if at all. With this movie I felt the need to reiterate what other reviewers have said thus far. It's a very Hollywood kind of tale. Acting is good from Tom Hardy, however he, like the film, could have done with some direction. I much prefer the original movie The Krays which is t as Hollywood and is more a telling of the actual violence these two brothers inflicted on 50's and 60's London."
" BIG FALL
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,1,Alexander the Great is Greek from Macedonia not from Skopje
" Disappointing but entertaining
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,7,"Based on the true story of the gangsters the Kray brothers the film should have been a perfect showcase for hunky Tom Hardys creative range and talent. Instead it's a half realized piece of Hollywood entertainment that never goes deep enough to be anything spectacular. Tracing the events of the rise of their criminal empire it also shows the abuse one of their wives endures. Props to the makers for keeping the gay element intact but for the most part it's kept off screen. Still for gangster movie fans especially it's a fun, engaging flick that's sadly forgettable. And as for Hardy, he's great but there's not such a huge difference between the characters that it's as impressive as it could have been.Budget: $25M
Box Office: $43M7/10"
" What a drag
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,2,"I love crime movies. Like i see 50 movies a year. But this was pits.
it's a 2 hour movie that seems like 3. Like i had to switch it off twice on the way. Story bad. Love bad. acting ok. faces too close to the camera. Yea thats what got me in the end."
" Vicious
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,9,"Great movie, very interesting. Only other thing to say is thank God Ronnie didn't h any children, and hopefully neither did Reggie. Cruel nasty animals"
" Nice gangster movie
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,9,"The conversations are nice
The action scenes are great
The story of real happenings is told awesome"
" Weak plot, average acting
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,5,"This movie does a bit of a disservice to the Kray legend. Characters are poorly formed, the story plods along with very little in terms of the true fear the Krays instilled.I spent more time looking at my phone for better movies the rest of the cast, like Chazz Palminteri, had been in.And it's sherbet lemons. Not sherbert."
" I'm seeing double,,,
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,6,"Hardy is without a doubt one of the top actors working now, and these performances only add to that fact. Pulling off twins?!? He did it very well. Other than that, the movie is good,, but it's not going to be one you watch over and over."
" Amazing!
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,10,"This film rates as one of my all time favorites. I have watched this film so many times because I love it so much. Firstly, Tom Hardy playing twin brothers as completely unique people is trully a sight to be seen. I didn't know much about the Kray Twins and I am sure that this film takes some liberties with the storyline, but I think it made for a better story."
" Unwatchable
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,1,"I've seen thousands of movies and read reviews on most, if not all of them. This is the very first movie I've ever felt the need to express my opinion on. First, I think Tom Hardy is brilliant and had high hopes for this movie as Bronson is one of my favourites. However, this movie was just plain unwatchable. I tried, I really did, to watch it. I had to stop watching it once because the plot was just too lazy. I then forced myself to return to it some weeks later, telling myself it would get better. Sadly, it did not. I barely made it past the halfway mark of the movie before I had to turn it off for good. Simply awful. Boring, poor acting, nothing, and no one to even be interested in much less, have any vested interest in. Extremely disappointed as I was hoping for so much more."
" Could've been so much better
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,6,"I had this on my watchlist for a while. I've followed Tom Hardy since his first films. I absolutely love him as an actor. Tom was excellent, as always. This film, however, was a bit long, half way through I almost gave up. The acting is perfect! You can feel the chemistry between Reggie and Frances. You can feel the conflict between Reggie and Ron. All the actors, even small roles, did a fantastic job. The problem is, the film couldn't figure out if it's a romance or a gangster/action film. It reminded me a bit of Wolf of Wall Street. The way it shows a man earning money and building an empire through illegal means and shows how it impacts his marriage. Wolf of Wall Street did a better job of this because it focused more on just how depraved and immoral the main character was. Legend just didn't find that balance. There are definitely scenes showing just how violent these brothers were but it wasn't enough. Perhaps this should've been a mini series. I'd like to know more about Ron's love life, they touched on it in the movie but didn't go anywhere with it. We just don't really get to know the characters enough. This film could've been so much better. I'd say to still watch it, YOU may enjoy it more than me."
" A compelling story of a pair of twins and half-measures
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,9,"Tom Hardy is masterfully playing twins with vastly different personalities. Their exchange are frictionless throughout the whole film, and makes for a really pulling relationship. Ronnie Kray was convincingly deranged thanks to Hardy's performance."
" Nothing new to see here
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,5,"The film is pretty standard ganster fare with the age old story of rise and fall but this differs only in the close family element of there being 2 main protagonists not one, very well played by Tom Hardy but thats also not surprising as we know he has the chops."
" Timing is Everything
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,7,"Like JFK and Malcolm X, the Kray twins benefit from the veneer of cool bestowed from being in their heyday during the early sixties; an era so cool it hurts... as this film never tires of reminding us.Thanks to Tom Hardy's terrific performance(s) and adroit editing and special effects, the illusion of two different brothers interacting is well maintained. But why did all involved insist on putting Ronnie throughout in glasses when (as anyone familiar with contemporary photographs will know) he was presumably too vain to actually wear them most of the time? Maybe it's to differentiate them. But in that case why, after all that money spent on recreating the period - not to mention the special effects - even more egregiously do both brothers sport identical anachronistic sets of sideburns they never wore in reality? (Along with many of the rest of the cast, like Christopher Eccleston as 'Nipper' Read). Just look at any picture of the pair."
" Deserved to have better rating
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"Because it's based on true story the movie seems very believable and realistic. Some issues that can happen not only in a gangster family. I liked it for the way it was narrated, for actors and for overall atmosphere.Movie doesn't pretend to be top notch, but it's solid 8"
" Tomas. Handsome genius
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,What an actor. What a character. I wish you s lot of ascension 👏🏻
" An absolute must see for Tom Hardy fans
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,7,"Legend is an intense watch with moments of huge enjoyment! A biopic of the real life criminals Ronald and Reggie Kray, identical twins who ruled the London underworld in the 1960s through horrific violence and inflicting fear. The prospect of Hardy playing both the twins sounded amazing from the get go and it's executed perfectly; in fact he is the absolute star on the film and the best part. What's most impressive is how he injects comic moments that enhance the tone into more of a pitch black comedy than a straight drama (Ronnie is a great cinematic creation) Having said that, the story does have incredibly dramatic moments that were harrowing to watch especially the first time round. If you're a sensitive viewer, like myself in many ways, there are a couple of scenes that will make you wince and stay with you for a while. One of which is an absolute brutal act of murder that is made all the more disturbing that it actually happened and is a viscerally brilliant scene but also a more problematic moment in which sexual assault is implied which I think is one of the downfalls of the film. It wasn't necessary and upon further reading apparently not factually accurate either. Writer/Director Brian Helgeland (A Knight's Tale, Payback) clearly has a lot of passion for the project and set out to make a modernised account of this story which is filmed and performed extremely well. Emily Browning is also fantastic as Frances and is our entrance point into the film on an emotional level I think. Although it may fall narratively at points, it's still a gripping watch and it's lead performances make this gangster flick stand out"
" Some issues, great performances
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,7,"I'd have to agree with most reviews here. Tom Hardy delivered an excellent performance! Actually all the acting, costumes and cinematography was great. Where the film failed in my eyes, was the pacing. I do love a slow paced movie or series, but Legend couldn't be placed anywhere on the spectrum. Some parts are dragged out and you can't help but loose interest, other times it takes huge time jumps leaving you wondering what the hell actually happened.
I guess it would have worked great as a series. There they could've dove deeper into the personalities and the side stories without making a mess or leaving the viewer bored.
I can't say anything about the accuracy of the story as I've never heard of the Kray family before watching the movie...
All in all (but mostly for Hardys amazing portrayal) I give it a 7/10. In an other format or with better pacing it would be a movie I really love."
" Legend is a very well told story of the real life on goings of the Kray twins ( UK A + Movie) My Ratings 9/10
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,9,"If you don't understand true British underworld history, it probably isn't for you, you won't understand it. Fifty years from now, Hardy wil go down as one of the greatest actors of all time. He absolutely nailed this roll - the era, the persona, just incredible."
" Tom Hardy is excellent
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this film, some of the historical perspective and Tom Hardy! Fabulous."
" Romance With A Gangster
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)Based on a true story, the twin Kray Brothers (BOTH played by excellently played by Tom Hardy) are hard as nails gangsters who start buying up prime London clubs and casinos by intimidation and force. Their influence stretches into holding some politicians and police under their thumb as their power increases. How far can their lawless activity last? The film is narrated by Reggie's girlfriend as she hopelessly attempts to keep him away from gangster activity. The other brother Ron is mentally unstable and adds a plethora of additional challenges to everyone's world. There are some brutal violent moments (especially a raw and gruesome stabbing), the acting is great and the production and cinematography are stellar."
" Tom Hardy is the only reason to watch
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,2,"I'll keep this short.
Tom Hardy does an excellent job of playing twins with an, at times, indecipherable cockney accent.
At over 2 hours, better use of the time could have been made to include facts, important characters and the true history of the violent Kray era.
More violent psychopaths who enjoyed hurting people, a bit of what really happened and less love story - if you're going to call them ""Legend"".
You're better off watching documentaries on Youtube about these brothers.
Ronnie Kray, for example, went on to be married. Twice. He had relationships with men AND women.
I watched this entire movie, waiting for it to start. It never did.
I was really disappointed."
" Enjoyable gangster romp.
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,7,"So Tom Hardy puts in a great performance with enough distict nuances to really reflect the fact hes playing 2 distinct characters, the story rarely grinds down in pace.
Not sure how much of it is true but its wrapped around a core real events and I found it quite a compelling watch."
" Odd song choices
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,5,"Gangster film set in 1960's England.
And we get all this funk/ soul music in the background. Odd choice.
The only conjecture I have as to why they chose the songs they did is that similar music has been successfully used in other crime/ gangster movies and they wanted to mimic that feel.
(Other than the club crooners) the music selection felt completely out of place and made the film feel contrived and hokey.I know music is a small thing to nitpick on but to me it stuck out like a sore thumb."
" Brillant work by Hardy
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,9,Tom Hardy steals the screen again. I am a huge fan of his and if a few others in the show. I do think it should've been more indepth on The Kray Twins story. But Tom was brilliant
" BROTHERLY LOVE
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,7,"This retelling of the CRAY twins fails miserably on to many levels,a brilliant duel portrayal of both brothers by TOM HARDY is destroyed by lack of story and character,the absence of the mother in this film is the absence of what compelled these infamous brothers to the height of the criminal underworld,bad plot bad story line and bad chronological events make this film mediocre at best...what a shame."
" Excellent Movie - Plenty Of Everything We Like - Based On Real Life gangsters
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,10,"01/20/2020 Wiki Short Bio: Ronald ""Ronnie"" Kray (24 October 1933 - 17 March 1995) and Reginald ""Reggie"" Kray (24 October 1933 - 1 October 2000), twin brothers, were English criminals, the foremost perpetrators of organized crime in the East End of London during the 1950s and 1960s. With their gang, known as ""The Firm"", the Krays were involved in murder, armed robbery, arson, protection rackets and assaults. STOP
Many other facets of truth can be researched on line."
" A Legend is supposed to be remembered.
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,5,"Tom Hardy's brilliant performance (along with tons of others) aside, this movie misses the mark. The lack of world-building and stakes in this film hurts the story. What are the twins up against? Law enforcement, prison, other gangs, themselves? Sure, all of the above, but it's as if the twins are untouchable throughout the film until their unpredictable, violent nature and grief suddenly catches up to them. Except they were unpredictable and violent from the start so it isn't meaningful when there are consequences out of the blue. While there are probably restrictions to what the story can be because it is based on true events, there are no obstacles or conflicts that can be felt through the film. The detective, who tries to build a case against them, should have been given a real storyline, personality, and morals instead of just showing up a couple times. There is also no follow through with the conflict Reggie faces with the Italian mafia. The narration was also an issue because its use in the latter portion of the film undercuts not only the emotional impact of death, but also the permanence of it. This movie was entertaining sometimes, but ultimately a let down."
" Ok but not great
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,5,"I really enjoyed the performances by Tim hardy and taron eggerton bit that was the only good thing in the film. The story lacked many of the crucial details that even drunk history was able to provide, and the writing was atrocious. I wasn't watching a story I was watching a Hollywood film (which I hate). There was a lot of potential for this movie and it was one I always wanted to see but it certainly disappointed. Anyway, if you enjoy Tom hardy or Taron Eggerton I suggest you watch this. Not for the actual film but just for me. I found myself struggling through the first and third acts just to enjoy this film."
" Intense, violent and powerful.
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie last night on Netflix. I give it an ""8"" because Tom Hardy's acting is over the top. I have watched Hardy in ""Peaky Blinders"" as Alfie Solomons. Hardy is a very strong, very good looking actor.His protrayal as twins is awesome. I laughed out loud at the point Ronnie says he is homosexual and explains there should be no shame in it. A few of the attendant men went into visible states of uneasiness; even embarrassment.The stabbing death of McVitie was over the top. If I caught Reggie's comment when asked ""Why?"" by Ronnie, Reggie responded, ""Because I really want to kill you, but you are my brother"".The viewer should be ready and prepared for extreme violence."
" If only understood a word the main actors said.
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,1,If you are an American get ready to strain yourself to understand a word the main actors are saying. I never understood why Brits hoping to make money in US use actors where 80% of their dialect will not be understood by Americans. Had to stop the movie after 10 minutes.
" Hardy is great, rest is meh
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,6,"As others have said, watching Tom Hardy play 2 different characters in the same film is quite a treat, as he does a great job of distinguishing between the 2 characters so that it's never a question of which one you're watching. Even without one wearing glasses, I still feel like I would immediately know which character I'm watching as Hardy gives them both their own individual personalities that are impossible to mistake for the other's.However, even Tom Hardy isn't enough to save this film from a mediocre script. The problem isn't that this is a bad movie, because it's not. By all accounts, it's a decent film. The problem is that it just doesn't stand out. There are about a million gangster films that have been made over the years and there are so many of them that are so top notch that if you're gonna make another one, it's gotta be really engaging to stand out among the crowd. Unfortunately, Legend just doesn't.The only reason I could see recommending this film to someone is if they're just a diehard Tom Hardy fan and just want to watch him in anything, no matter what it is. If it's a good gangster film you're looking for, there are a lot of better ones to choose from.6/10"
" Entertaining semi biopic
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,7,Well acted and with a sense of drama added but another 'based on true story' film. As most will know means that many and in some cases all events are missed or fictional depending on the writers and directors whim.nevertheless an entertaining drama well filmed and acted.
" Silly .....
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,1,"The Krays were horrible nasty pieces of work...they were not Legend just scum.
Some of the film looks like an rated X Carry on Film.."
" My veiws on Legend
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,9,I thought Legend was a amazing film considering Tom Hardy is playing both brothers and all acting was fantastic.
" I Love this Film!
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,10,"Stumbled upon ""Legend"" by accident and was immediately captivated by the opening scene. As a period piece the look and feel of post-war London is done perfectly. Tom Hardy as both twin brothers does a fantastic job and it is hard to decide which performance is more compelling but, I have to admit, Reg is the more fascinating brother, with his darkness and quirks.As a fan of the American films ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Departed"" I have to sat this film completes my ""must see"" triad of gangster films."
" David Thewlis Filmography Project
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,6,"#21 LegendLeslie Payne = The Accompanying CharacterPros: An entertaining and easy to watch the film without complications that despite not reinventing or doing anything new in the British Crime/Mob genre is made for you to keep watching, here David gives life to Leslie a bully related to organized crime in the 1960s. Tom Hardy's double character is perhaps the most interesting surprise in the whole story, I thought that seeing him in a double role would be boring but in the end, it wasn't! Once again David becomes a character that only serves to accompany or support the protagonist of the story that in this case is Hardy; it is a solid film after all and nothing more, if you like Gangster No. 1 this film will not disappoint you, but in turn, are not good if we compare them.Cons: It's unfortunate that in 2015 a director or scriptwriter can't make a more original film or story and use ideas or clichés so common in many others because the film has so many of them. The last part is boring and poorly done and does not give you interest or follow up on what happens at the end. Seeing Chazzz Palminteri and David in the same scene reminds me how much they are aging now."
" Tom Hardy is excellent. Can't understand a word
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,6,Excellent acting by Tom Hardy. I can barely understand what is being said. If Tom Hardy wasn't the lead I would have turned it off 2 minutes in.

",2019-07-17 00:00:00,2,Tim Hardy was great in this movie. I forgot that in both roles I look at him. Really good for his acting skills. The movie is well made. But more positive things I can not say. I did not like it. I was dissatisfied with the overall picture of the film.

",2019-06-26 00:00:00,5,"Tom Hardy has ascended to acting greatness. This performance was remarkable and he is now my second favorite actor after Christian Bale and ahead of DiCaprio. I didn't really like this movie tho. it was moderately interesting and had some awesome moments but overall I wasn't a fan. (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
his performance as both lead roles was AMAZING. he was two completely different people. COMPLETELY different. the way they talk, mannerisms, facial cues, everything. I'm astounded"
" Tom Hardy should have won an Oscar
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,8,"Tom Hardy stole the show on this one. He was able to show the dynamics of both brothers perfectly. It was also pointed out that he was acting off of himself; What I mean by that is that normally actors act by reacting to their counterpart, however, Tom Hardy had no one to act off of which makes this performance even more impressive."
" Nothing new, a predicted boring movie
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,4,"Nothing new, a predicted boring movie. All characters are typical. Narative taken from other stories. Waste of time"
" Let me say
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,3,"Oh, what an inspiring story! What a sizzling direction! So exciting! The characters are so lovable!Honestly, better watching the paint dry.
This is just a dull chronicle of murders and madness.Three stars for the beautiful Emily Browning."
" Well, they had me fooled!
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,7,"I never realized that Hardy was playing the both of them!
Good London Gangland style material, the British version of the Mafia is much more vicious, and this movie portrays it in all of its torturous, maiming methods. The Mafia usually ""off"" their victims, but for some reason the brutes back home seem to prefer scarring and maiming . In their minds it's probably a better method to have a living reminder to potential enemies of what can happen to you if you don't toe the line ( and cutting off a toe is a common device)I'm sure glad I never came into contact with them, 'cos I've got a big mouth and I tend to stand up to people . If you stood up to these boys then you ended up seriously injured or dead.
That reign of terror is over now only to be replaced by some other kingpins who have much the same way of doing things as their predecessors. One good thing that I take out of the Gangland Life is that if you don't mess with them then they don't bother you.And so to the movie, it's realistic and reflects the culture of the times very well.
The Krays liked to show off their power with fancy cars and night clubs but strangely enough they didn't seem to go for the flash palaces, swimming pools and the overt displays of wealth that happens in America.They were happy with those night clubs and booze and they didn't seem to need much more. Their motivation was spreading fear and protecting home turf from nasty invaders
You don't have to look far when you're casting for Cockney type movies and they always seem to get a crew that you think they've dragged in off the street.Just super characterizations in every role. No pretty boys wiv' perfick teeth, just the usual battered, broken nosed ugly thugs on the men's side, and normal Mum's and girls on the female side.
Not a real classic because it's got no plot but it's worth watching"

" Tom Hardy double action
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,8,"First of all I got to say that I still enjoy this movie after watching it for the third time which is pretty rare with the more recent movies. Fair enough I have to admit that it's mostly Tom Hardys play that kept me into this movie. The way he displays these two characters is just brilliant. Both characters are excellently portrait in their own style and manners and the authority Hardy transfers is really strong. Especially the scenes where both are in the same room are such fun to watch. The other characters seem a bit flat but that might just be because of the outstanding work of Hardy. But it doesn't really bother anyway since the movie focuses on the Kray Brothers and their individual ways and problems resulting of that. I really liked the camera ankels and perspectives. You can see that most scenes are shot at actual places rather than in studio sets. One thing I didn't really liked after seeing the movie a few times now is the main musical theme which in my opinion sounds a little bit to heartless and uninnovative.
All in all 'Legend' is a well worked movie which kept me entertained more than once."
" ""You know, me and my brother, we're going to rule London.""
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,8,"It wasn't until the movie was over while watching the credits roll that I realized the characters of both Ron and Reggie Kray were both played by Tom Hardy. He did quite the exceptional job of portraying the brother gangsters with their own unique personas and quite different looks for being paternal twins. They also shared common attributes as well, the most noticeable being a predisposition for violence when it suited them, and it seemed to suit them a lot. Reggie had a bit more self control, and when Frances Shea (Emily Browning) entered his life, he more or less tried to keep his impulses under control, but situations often demanded that he get involved in a bit of brutality.It wasn't quite a year ago I first heard of The Krays via another movie that came out about the same time, ""The Rise of the Krays"". That film also contained it's share of bloody violence, but it wasn't as compelling as this one, so if you have a choice, stick with ""Legend"". Like a lot of brothers, Ron and Reggie had moments when they fell out with each other, and those times are depicted with some nasty bloodletting. Ron obviously didn't have enough of a personal filter to avoid insulting his brother's gal, and their resultant brawl was one of the highlights of the picture. All throughout though, one is never left conflicted about the brothers loyalty to each other, even when it's confirmed that Ron's condition is certified insane.The first time I ever watched a movie in which a dead person narrates, I was taken aback by it somewhat (can't remember what it was off hand). But apparently it's a convention that's being utilized more and more often, as Frances Shea does the honors in this story, explaining how she came to love and hate The Krays at the same time, enough so that she eventually married Reggie despite her reservations about living with a gangster. Her death from an overdose was almost entirely predictable, having chosen a life from which there would have been no way out."
" Hardy at his best
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,8,Fantastic movie. I enjoyed the old Kray brothers movie and expected this to fall short of it as many remakes do however this was not a remake or revamp at all. Tom Hardy played both brothers excellently and apparrently in line with the real London gangster brothers. If you like gritty gangster movies this is a must.
" Bravo!
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,8,"Finally! after the B movies ive had to endure in regards to the kray twins they've finally made a film worth reviewing. Well Tom hardy always delivers so his Reggie & Ronnie is flawless! Yes he plays both & you wouldn't belive it for a second. The rest of the cast are done to perfection with an all in all well put together film taken from the view of frances, reggies wife. Thus taking on a slightly different journey to its predecessor with the kemp twins, also a good watch but a very close second if not on par version of the krays escapades.. a bit of romance, comedy & a good gangster flick thats well worth a watch."
" SUPERB acting by Tom Hardy
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,7,"The movie was not so good and disappointed me.
But the cast were actually pretty good especially Tom Hardy that was really smart choice by the director.
And I think the director did very well for making both of the krays , played by one actor (Tom Hardy).
And Tom Hardy was AMAZINGLY FLAWLESS in the very movie and I think he MUST win a OSCAR!!!"
" This movie really hates Greece, its History and greek people!!!!
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,1,"It is unacceptable to be said in this movie that Alexander the Great was not Greek but Macedonian !!!! Macedonia is Greece and Greece is Macedonia!!!! It is the same thing!!!! Alexander the Great was Greek from the Greek kingdom of Macedonia!!!! Like the Greek kingdom of Athens, of Sparta e.t.c. ... With the same thinking let's say that Leonidas the king of Sparta was not Greek but Spartan!!!! What are you talking about?????? Are you really crazy????? Shame on you!!!It is like you say that those who live in New York are New Yorkers and no USA citizens!!!! Learn history and stop to insult The Holy History of Greece - Hellas and Alexander the Great!!!!!!"
" Tom Hardy
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,7,Watch the movie to see Tom Hardy's genious performance. I would've liked a little more in-depth exploration of why they were who they were but this comes as an afterthought because I was so engrossed with TH's work. I'm a hardcore fan so grain of salt for those who are not. (This movie might change your mind though)
" One of the best films ever made
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,10,"This is an absolutely fantastic amazing film, Tom Hardy playing both roles and done it amazingly, a fantastic actor who seems to play all his roles brilliantly, if you have not watched it, well you should"
" Yeah it's pretty much the best movie you'll ever watch.
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,10,"If only I could rate this higher than 10, because I would. It's my favourite movie of all time, every second and minuet is an enjoyable one. No exaggeration. I've watched it three times in one week and I'll continue to watch it a million times more, Tom Hardy nails every part as does all the actors and actresses in this movie. This movie is bursting with talent and that's undeniable."
" camp hilarity
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,1,"This film is hilarious. The acting, by one of the true greats of our time, Tom Hardy, is scenery chewing campery at its finest. It's so over the top that you will spend the film film picking your jaw off the ground in disbelief. The music is also hilariously bad. Add a script that has no heart and it all adds up to a great night in. Enjoy!"
" Great Hardy, disasterous everything else
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,6,"What a another great 10/10 (double) acting by Tom Hardy. And what an unbelievably spoiled film by everything else. Screenplay and plot turning around Krey's wife, making it rather kind of family//girlfriend movie than expected gangster flic. Bellow average soundtrack and average photography makes it overally great disappointment. Without Tom Hardy, my rating would be 3/10."
" Standard Kray Biography - More Heat Than Light
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,2,"A few years ago a 'vandal' on Wiki suggested that a retired senior detective spent his retirement 'boring the arse off' regulars at his local pub regaling them with stories about his heydey at The Yard. Choice words, given the cottage industry that surrounds the Kray biographies - most of them heavily reliant on the same antedotes - rather ironic as well.John Pearson's The Profession of Violence is probably the best book on the Krays, albeit a little old by now. When I heard this was to be the source for Legend, I was intrigued - and somewhat hopeful at what it might cover; Reg and Ron's codependency? The feud with the Richardsons? The duel with Nipper Read's taskforce? The trip to Nigeria? The Transatlantic connection? Their ties to Boothby and High Society?What we got was a series of historical set pieces wrapped around a sluggish love story, interspersed with a few violent scenes, that only achieved an uneven tone and an incoherent storyline. It took about forty five minutes for something to happen once we got past the well staged opening fight. Lots of heavy-handed symbolism, and a largely wasted cast - although fair play to Tom Hardy for a first rate turn as Reg/Ron. David Thewlis impressed at slimy fixer/front man/double agent Dennis Payne (his allegencies deserved their own film) ; Emily Browning's a good actress, but she's a mediocre at best here, seemingly lost without adequate characterization or direction; Christopher Eccleston is wasted (as is most the cast) in a nothing role as Nipper Read.For all its faults and estorectic nonsense, Peter Mendel's 1990 version capture the drabness and claustrophobia of the era and the environment. Legend is simply a glossy excercise (sometimes well acted) that fails to tells the true story behind the Twins, their psychology or their criminal operations.Worth it only for Tom Hardy and David Thewlis."
" Had a wonderful time watching it!
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,9,"Don't understand the low average (7) score. Fenomenal Tom Hardy's performances as Ronnie and Reggie Kray. While watching it I completely forgot that these two characters are played by the same man. Nice doses of English humour, good love story and definitly a gangster storyline told in a way we are not used! Well done all, I had a good time watching it."
" Very poor attempt
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,5,"Appalling film about an atrocious family.Just like how the Krays were a second-rate pair of gangsters, this film is a suitably crap commentary on their exploits. A great cast give some great performances, but this fails to deliver. That said, I've seen it twice. Don't take that as any recommendation, it doesn't grow on you. Get Carter and the Long Good Friday have to be the finest British gangster films, this is frankly rubbish."
" Ugh
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,3,"I thought I was watching a particularly bad episode of the Benny Hill show. Awful script, average acting."
" Rise and fall of a diabolical villain pairing
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,6,"The twinset and burly this time was portrayed by just one performer, Tom Hardy. It was a laudable performance for the charisma he brought to the parts but all in all it is an underwhelming film. It lacked substance and, like The Krays (1990), it failed to achieve the sort of chills the infamous crime brothers were know for. Too much black humour and background music reduced the tension in the violent sequences. The film has a good supporting cast, however, so the film is watchable."
" DO YOU LIKE BEING A GANGSTER?
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,8,"As Ron would say, ""It's interesting."" This is based on the true story of the Kray brothers (Tom Hardy) who ruled and terrorized London as gangsters. As the film begins they are already established gangsters being followed by the ""coppers"" wherever they go. Ron is being certified as crazy and takes meds. Part of the film is narrated by Frances Shea (Emily Browning) the girlfriend and wife of Reggie.The film is told as Reggie having to choose between his brother and everything else. Ron prevents Reggie from going straight and living the life Frances wants him to live. She had trouble coping with much of their life style. Ron is a very open homosexual in addition to his mental issues.The film ends at their arrests."
" Twins' Relationship Centre Of Movie
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Is there anything Tom Hardy can't do? Great performance from Emily Browning too. I liked how the film treated the relationship between the twin brothers- it becomes the centre of the movie. I find the pair fascinating as twins more than as gangsters. Btw, if you are usually annoyed by voice-over narration (as I am) hang in there as here it turns out to be a clever device."
" Legend - a paranoid schizophrenic walks into a bar!
",2018-04-25 00:00:00,10,"True story - Set in 1960's London. Legend is a classic British gangster thriller, tells the rise and fall of London's most notorious gangsters, Reggie and Ronnie Kray. Both roles were very convincingly portrayed by Tom Hardy, I frequently forgot that both roles were the same actor.There are loads of graphically violent scenes, look out for the bar fight where the brothers are facing off a rival gang. Ronnie, the paranoid schizophrenic, walks out and immediately returns with two hammers and all hell breaks loose! Very highly recommended."
" Hardy mumbling
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,5,"Could have been an eight star movie however, ruined by Tom Hardy's inaudible muttering, he needs to learn how to deliver a line then could be a decent actor. Outdoor scenes are completely ridiculous, never seen the east end looking so clean and sterile. All in all an old fashioned British B movie, only watch if you have no alternative."
" Best Kray Brothers movie ever!
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,9,"Tom Hardy is absolutely amazing as both KRAY brothers! Emily Browning is also incredible as Frances. She is brilliant in this. Yea, of course I did get some flashbacks of BANE i.e. BATMAN in Hardy's performance. BUT, If it works, then it works, and I t works here VERY WELL!. Great story telling, great supporting cast Highly Recommended."
" Hardy and Browning were great but the film was a waste of time.
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,3,I got in to just over an hour and whatever heft the film attempted to show was sucked dry by a director (Helgeland) trying to be Tarantino. The use of the 1960's American jazz and soul sounded more like Jackie Brown than Swinging London. The gay brother's perversion as well as the old fruit who indulged in the same was proof positive the director/screenwriter hadn't much original material to begin with.It is surprising considering his body of work - the sets looked like they were all shot inside a studio instead out doors.
" Brilliance doubled!
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,8,"The fascination about the infamous Gangsters, is that they were so alike. Hardy manages to take on both roles and bring to life (instead) the differences in the twins. The loyalty, the liabilities, the business minds, the brutality. Prison, mental institutions all covered in everything ever written about the Krays, but this film digs that little bit deeper and that is down to Hardy's interpretations."
" Tom Hardy/Story
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,8,"With a story like that and with an actor like Tom Hardy this film could be much more. The story is a bit superficial only focussing on the 2 main characters but the acting of Tom Hardy is something else and that balances the movie. In the end, 2 hours well spent."
" Great acting, great cars, not so great rest.
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,6,"Like many others here, I share the opinion on Hardy's performance: It was great. He played the two characters so differently, I didn't even see the same actor in them. Even though Hardy plays both of the main characters, I could distinguish them in every second of the movie.
The props were great too. I am sucker for old cars and the 60s in general, so that was great, really.But the other things that play into a good movie, for example a compelling plot(!) was not really there. I got so bored at times, at the dialogue, at things repeating themselves, etc. There were one or two scenes in the movie that I really enjoyed, but most of the time I just sat there, waiting for something to happen. After one hour, I thought the movie should be over soon - only to find out I hadn't even watched half of the movie. I stuck through it nonetheless, because I thought something gamechaning or super amazing would happen, something I couldn't predict or anything like that, but nothing happened.All in all I would say that you could watch this film if you are into mafia-gangster-movies, into the 60s and cool cars, or into a really good acting performance, but you don't have to. It's not a Must-see. It's a Could-watch-if-bored."
" Bad reviews from those who don't get it
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,9,"Have done what I do on the rare occasion I don't care about plot twists and such and read some reviews on IMDB whilst about 75% through the movie. Am assuming that those giving the movie bad reviews with regards to accuracy or claiming the film glorifies mobsters are either American or clueless snowflakes bought up in the world after Python, Morecombe & Wise, The Two Ronnies, Derek and Clive and such, all whose whole thing was based on tongue firmly planted in cheek.SPOILER ALERTFFS people, this film is pure satire, and it's genius! The reason I paused it to post this was that an example of the satirical nature is when Ron is about to carry out his hit at The Blind Beggar, he asked his sidekick ""How do I look?"" to which he gets his desired reply, ""F*cking deadly!"" Priceless.And when it comes to glorifying mobsters, the way Reggie behaves against those who cross him, even when it's unintentional, shows his true nature. So it is made perfectly clear he's as bad as his twin despite the BS he gives his girl. (Who is lovely by the way.)The film dives in, so those complaining it doesn't go into depth about the history fo the characters should read a book, where there is space. This isn't a biography, it's entertainment, and on that front, it's working for me.I'll continue my review after the remaining 25%."
" Glorification of two of gangland's biggest thugs...
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,5,"The Krays are well known in the UK, by the elder generation for the celebrity campaigns that used to nauseate us for their release, and the even older generation for the fear their numbers used to execute to maintain their power.However, apparently this film has been a huge success in the UK, so the younger generation have had their interest piqued possibly for a romanticism of old school gangsters, which is disturbing, and this film has milked it.Starring one of the current favourites of the screen, Tom Hardy, he plays both the twins, one seriously but the other other quite cartoonish. I've mixed reactions to it, but the final result is that their vicious sides and evil ethics weren't at the fore. If anything, the love story between one of the twins (Reggie Kray) and his wife is a larger part of the story, which is baffling.On the other hand, Emily Browning for me was the best part of the film, as the gangster's downtrodden wife, whilst the crime part just didn't work very well.The settings are stylish, London is beautiful and the police are moral but limited.Overall, it's quite a waste. Some may not like to say it but the previous Krays movie with the lead two from Spandau Ballet (UK pop group) was far more menacing and possibly closer to the grim truth.I didn't like this film, it's disappointing, and I'd recommend that you pass on it. But in the UK, the numbers show that local heroes like to be fawned over by people trying to believe there was a fairer world back long ago."
" 1990's ""The Krays"" is a much better film
",2017-12-09 00:00:00,4,"I finally watched ""Legend"" in the hope that it might equal ""The Krays"" (1990) which is a very fine film. Unfortunately it falls far short of that lofty goal. Tom Hardy is excellent in his dual role which is, of course, a marvel of modern film technology. Both Krays appearing in the same scene, both facing the camera, played by one actor in seamless perfection is technically impressive.However, the story telling is a.) uneven, b.) incredibly slow and boring at times, and c.) not nearly as insightful as ""the Krays"" and lacking the visceral impact of that powerful movie. Just reciting a series of historical facts and asking your lead actor to put some emotion in them, doesn't add up to good movie making. A lot of talent was wasted in the process, especially Tara Fitzgerald and Taron Egerton who were reduced to wallpaper roles. Emily Browning's impressive efforts in portraying poor love struck Frances are above par but they pale in comparison with those of Kate Hardie who played that role in the 1990 version.I would have rated this movie higher than the 4 I gave it, if it were not for the odd stretches of prolonged dull scenes of, well, nothing. The 1990 original is much better on many levels."
" Good Fellas in London

Twins brother Reginald/Reggie Kray (Tom Hardy) and his brother Ronald/Ronnie run their club and extort protection from local business owners during their reign in London during the late sixties.Reggie sets his eyes upon the sister of his driver, Frances (Emily Browning). She is flattered by the attention, but not sure if she wants the life Reggie is involved in. Francis is conflicted with her upbringing vs the life Reggie offers. Reggie's family accepts the brothers means of making a living by not asking asking any questions. In the end as with all those who make a living involved with a life a crime, it never turns out well."
" Music By Carter Burwell
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,7,"""Legend"", the Limey version of Scorsese's ""Casino"", a film that also fell a little short of its mark but is relentlessly entertaining, in part, due to its overlapping scores that P.T Anderson would perfect in ""Magnolia"". This film's score, however, actually repels the viewer instead of sucking them in. We hear Duffy's ""Make The World Go Away"" twice, which would have been fine if there was a point to hearing it again but I just thought it was lazy. Speaking of lazy, Carter Burwell only supplied 2 original pieces... that sound exactly the same. The 1st is the ""Legend"" theme when the Krays are in the backseat of their car, being driven nowhere specific and lord, is it every sleepy and dreary? Not the type of introductory music you want when introducing the leads, who become one note caricatures themselves- still one note more than the theme had though. The 2nd is ""Your Race Is Run"", which plays during the epilogue when Reggie has killed The Hat- the defining moment of the entire film, alas, played by what sounds to be a coffee house band of High School children. The trumpet sounds as if it were put in someone's hands while they were sleeping, every exhale another overdrawn note. Carter Burwell, you are a lucky duck. Being given a ""Music By"" credit for two versions of the same terrible song. With so many musicians and conductors chomping at the bit for work, I can't defend this yawn-inducing entry that assists in ""Legend's"" downfall after act 2. What's happened to standards?"
" The Hardy Twins, what a treat
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,8,"The original film about the subject ""The Krays"" (1990) had Billie Whitelaw as their mother and, somehow, she dominated my memory of the film. Here the twins have a mother but she is, on the film, a distant character and that's what I missed here. I missed their interaction. She clearly had a massive influence in their characters but in Legend, those pieces of the puzzle are unfortunately missing. But, Tom Hardy compensates for any flaws. He is extraordinary, twice. The twins are total individuals, totally two people. What they carry in common is a sort of sexual danger, one explicitly the other implicitly but both as powerful. They dare us to get close. Amazing performance(s)"
" Should watch for Tom Hardy
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,8,"The story is simple, and based on real events, Kray brothers in London mafia. It contains some brother drama, thrilling events but not very outstanding. Acting is undoubtedly perfect, Tom Hardy excels in this play. In overall, it was just fun to watch. I advise you to watch it without much expectation."
" The very best of the Kray films, I calls it.
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed Legend towards the beginning — lots of great local color & interesting characters & the fight at the Pig & Whistle is one of the jolliest I've ever seen. Only Ronnie Kray could have been maniacal enough to convince a whole bar full of hard cases intent on serious mischief that: a) he'd brought along two pistols to what he reckoned to be a shootout, b) he'd get so infuriated that the other side was armed with nothing more than iron pipes & the like & c) he'd forget about his twin brother & stalk off in sheer indignation.It was far less enjoyable, tho no less brilliant, later on when it all turned dark & nasty. I'm sure it must have felt much like that to the Krays too, watching their lives spin out of control.Tom Hardy did a brilliant job portraying both twins; I had to keep reminding myself this was the same actor, all the while marveling at his versatility. His characterization of violently schizoid Ronnie was admirably nuanced. Making him hateful would have been so so easy, but half the time Hardy had you feeling sorry for the poor daft bugger. Brilliant. The very best of the Kray films, I calls it."
" A solid movie even if you are not British
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,8,"Hard to understand much of the language though it is English which is normal if you are an American till the second half. But on to the movie. I am a identical twin myself so this movie resonated more with me. And all my reviews are spoilers so if you read any, they always are.So watched last night and two twins, one insane and in a mental hospital, though I guess they treated people there better in the states at that time, is released because of their connections. Losing all integrity as the psychatrist says before releasing him.So romance and the good twin gets married, though later raping your wife calls that into question, and for all of us that have enjoyed courtship and falling in love there are some beautiful scenes and dialoge between them. Well written as they are both independent and themselves.So the good twin goes to jail and in the meantime the paranoid schitzophrenic ruins the club when he gets out. Insults his wife and they fight and hugged afterwords. Should of done that with my own twin in Deadwood but that is another story.She realizes he will remain a gangster and starts being a ""pill popper"". As after the marriage he spends most of his time of his time at the club and doesn't spend time or love with here and his gentleman facade deteriorates and she is miserable. She commits suicide but after his twin ruins everything, and can go into all the details but it is an over 2 hour movie though it was never boring. I just don't feel like writing it. So he chooses family loyalty over his wife and regrets it and dies of cancer shorty after his release from prison. How a man could spend 33 years with that on his conscience I do not know. I know the bulliten board has been removed but you read books, watch film, look at art, and you want to share your experience of it.Hence the numbing of the emotions. It's a lot like a British Martin film but not as well done but with the same narrative and filming.So she overdoses, they both go to prison and die miserabley. Would of been better if they put at the beginning that this is based on a true story for us Americans here. Overall though. I watched Hardy in a movie just driving through the whole thing shot in very short while and he was suffering from a cold. He is one of my favorite actors and everything he does is worth watching in my opinion."
" Good mainly because of Tom Hardy
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,6,"Tom Hardy is Brilliant in this and after a while you forget that he is acting both roles as Reggie and Ronnie. Nothing much new in this apart from the tragedy of Reggie's wife Frances and that is the slant that they put on this otherwise well known story, but it is in fact Hardy's portrayal of Ronnie that is most outstanding. he captures the true madness of the man without becoming a caricature.His portrayal of Reggie was also pretty much spot on and showed how he struggled with wanting to be a successful businessman but unable to escape his violent side.Without Tom Hardy's exceptional acting though the movie would have been pretty dull."
" Incredible characterisation!
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,9,Was convinced to watch by a friend and didn't think I would enjoy. Was absolutely captivated by Tom Hardy's performance as the Cray twins! Each subtle character choice was seamlessly woven in and created two completely unique individuals! A masterclass in characterisation and I would recommend any aspiring actors to watch.
" Bonded by blood
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,3,"Some years after they died, Reggie Kray and his more psychotic twin brother Ronnie still attract attention.They ruled the London underworld in the 1960s and attracted glamour through celebrities as well as the attention of the police. They used threats and violence to establish a foothold to run nightclubs and operate protection rackets. Dogged detective Nipper Read tried for years to get the twins behind bars.Tom Hardy plays both roles. Reggie is the more straightforward gangster, level headed, he falls in love but still prone to bouts of violence. Ronnie suffered from complex schizophrenia, he was unhinged, homosexual and could fly off the handle very easily.Brian Helgeland wrote and directed this rather muddled film. Apart from the brothers and Reg's romance with Frances, most of the characters are caricatured and the story flatly portrayed which needed a heavy voice over. Christopher Eccleston is wasted as Nipper Read and the third Kray brother is never mentioned.Peter Medak's 1990 film The Krays which was more low budget tried at least to aim higher. It showed the brothers coming up through the ranks as gangsters and the enemies they made, we see them getting into trouble during National Service and we also see a more complex relationship they has with their mother."
" Entertaining
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,8,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Legend"" (2015) is kinda ""been there saw that"" type of crime biopic. Performances were descent by everyone including the brilliant Tom Hardy - he is good in here, playing two roles. It is far from his best performance, but it is a pretty good one and involving. The movie itself is also kinda entertaining. It is not a best gangster drama by far out there, and although at running time 2 h 5 min this movie does drag here and there (especially towards the end with Emily Browning scenes) while it lasted i was entertained. Overall, ""Legend"" is definitely a pretty good movie. Good central performance / performances by Tom Hardy and pretty entertaining script makes this movie involving. It is far from anything great in any category, but it is a pretty descent movie."
" Not a bad film at all
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,6,"This movie is not bad, and Tom Hardy is a great actor, however......... It is advertised as the 'TRUE' story and biopic of the Kray twins but the movie is filled with inaccuracies (which of course I realise is done in films to add drama etc, but I believe if that is the case it should be advertised with the words 'based on the lives of....' included) I personally found the film quite slow-paced at times, and with a running time of over 2 hours, I think the film could have easily lost at least 30 mins and still worked, it was very drawn out and I noticed I wasn't the only one in the cinema who broke out into a yawn. As I mentioned earlier, Tom Hardy is a great actor and his portrayal of both Ronnie and Reggie Kray was very impressive, and I thought was more realistic than the portrayal of the twins by the Kemps in the 1990 film 'The Krays'. It is not a bad film and, overlooking the inaccuracies, gives a good insight for those unfamiliar with the truth, but could have, and should have, dealt more with the lives and power the Krays had over the east end of London in the 60's as well as their eventual downfall. Worth watching but I'd recommend you wait 'til it comes out on Sky or TV."
" Underrated
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"Legend was an entertaining and decent film. It tells the story about the notorious Kray twins who were infamous gangsters in England. Tom Hardy delivers a memorable performance as he portrays both the twin brothers and their unique personalities. Sadly both Tom Hardy and Legend were overlooked at the award ceremonies. Legend was a coherent and well paced film that told a true story. It showcased great moments, suspense and action scenes. Some would say it slightly resembled a Greek tragedy that a number of great organized crime movies have displayed. We saw the rise of the twins with opening a new club, striking lucrative deals and securing love interests. Then we saw the demise and train wreck that ends with jail time. Arguably one of the most entertaining films of the year that deserves a higher rating on IMDb."
" A Cray, Kray Brotherhood.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,6,"My first question: ""Can Reggie actually even drive""? He never ended up teaching Frances how to drive, and I believe it's because he himself, can't... All he knows, all he and his brother know, is gangsterism.Tom Hardy was excellent, and I expected no less from him. Emily Browning also displayed some quality in her performance, and was quite lovely to watch.Legend starts off very promisingly, but then with every passing minute, it deflated. In the beginning you don't really feel the puncture, however towards the end, all you want to do is pull over to the side because the ride has lost some momentum.The way the story was told and/or directed, lacked some fluidity of sorts. I mean, Reggie went to jail twice, the Richardson's rivalry flatlined, then got Ron into jail/mental hospital, Paul Bettany's character was there, then not... The timeline was, not well handled at all and, the whole coalition with the mafia, seemed to just evaporate. All of that and more happened in this movie, but it didn't really come together satisfactorily.The Kray brothers may have been the bosses of London, but sadly, somehow, this movie didn't quite portray a story I feel, needed telling. Perhaps their story is actually legendary, however, Legend failed to convince me.Again, Tom Hardy was superb, but, he wasn't enough to save this movie, as it were... Because it wasn't a bad movie at all, but, it wasn't nearly as enthralling as it could've been either. 6.4/10.And my second question: ""Why was Frances the one, narrating the film""? I find that very interesting, and not in the way Ronnie Kray found things interesting."
" Legend Review
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,5,"I had my doubts going into the movie Legend. I don't know why I did, but I just didn't have high expectations for this movie. See if I was wrong on the matter.Synopsis: The true story of London's most notorious gangsters, twins Reggie and Ronnie Kray. As the brothers rise through the criminal underworld, Ronnie advances the family business with violence and intimidation while Reggie struggles to go legitimate for local girl Frances Shea. In and out of prison, Ronnie's unpredictable tendencies and the slow disintegration of Reggie's marriage threaten to bring the brothers' empire tumbling to the ground. Starring: Tom Hardy, Tom Hardy Director: Brian HeglelandWell, first thing, I hardly ever like it where one actor plays two different parts in one movie. Look at the other ones: Van Damme in almost any movie he ever made, Armie Hammer in Social Network, Andy Garcia in a movie I can't even remember the name of. The movies don't hold up just because you get two of someone. Tom Hardy in this movie was no different. I know the guys were identical in almost every way, one was a few inches taller than the other and a few other minor differences, but that doesn't mean they couldn't have found someone else for the second role and just have the actors switch out from time to time.One thing that did work for this movie was that Tom Hardy was in it. The man is a diverse actor. This role(s) proved he could do almost anything. He wasn't the only good actor from the movie. Surprisingly, Taron Eggert was amazing as well. This movie was BASED off a true story. They used liberties as people do with other true stories. Do I agree with them changing aspects of people's lives? No, but you have to understand why they do it. Some things just aren't interesting, so they make them more lively. Did it help here? Yes and no. I'm not going to give away aspects of the movie, because I don't know what they changed, and also I don't like ruining movies for people. I just want to give you all some knowledge on the movie and you decide if you want to watch the movie based off what I say.Final Thoughts: If you like true stories, you may like this one. I personally didn't think it was that good. It wasn't bad either. Tom Hardy made the movie, then again, playing a duel role he unmade the movie.Rating: 5 out of 10"
" An Enjoyable Telling Of London's Most Notorious Gangsters
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"I had been looking forward to seeing Legend since I knew of it's making and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed with this latest telling of the Krays infamous legacy. I'm not a ""know-it-all"" when it comes to the Krays, but I've been intrigued about them, their reign and how they came to be probably since The Krays (1990) was released. Legend was another chance to have a brief look into the lives of London's most feared criminals of the 50s and 60s.This telling of the Krays story starts off by showing the two brothers already at the height of their power in the 60s and doesn't give much telling prior to their reign or of their upbringing which is a bit disappointing as that's a bit like entering a movie theater halfway through. Legend focuses more ON their legacy rather than that AND their lives prior which, like I say, is disappointing, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.As I mentioned earlier, The Krays (1990) is where I first started to gather interest in the twins and that film itself is an excellent watch with the Kemp Bros. giving really good performances. The main differences between the two films are the violence and the telling of the brothers early lives. Some of the violence in The Krays is quite brutal and the most violent it gets in Legend is the odd shooting, stabbing, and gang brawl. With the performance Hardy gives playing the two brothers, however, it's still enough to show that the Krays were not to be messed with.Performance wise, Hardy's double role as the twins is nothing short of excellent with his different portrayals making it seem as if you're watching him and an identical Hardy brother. The cast all over do a very good job, but Hardy is the obvious standout, and the filming of his roles was handled really well especially when the two characters are on screen together.If you enjoy gangster drama's such as The Godfather, Casino & Goodfellas then you won't go far wrong with Legend."
" Yes, it's another 'Kray film' (but it does have Tom hardy in!)
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"'The Krays' are possibly one of the most 'filmed' real-life personalities Britain has ever produced. It seems we can't get enough of their antics as the twin brothers terrorised the London underworld scene all those years ago. There has been countless films made about their dastardly exploits and now we have 'Legend' – another one.Basically, it's another 'true' story of their lives. In other words it's based on what people have said about them over the years and bits and pieces of fact mixed with a better and more concise way of telling their story. The brothers' tale has been put on film so many times it's hard to get that excited any more. However, this one has Tom Hard in. And not just Tom Hardy, but Tom Hardy AND Tom Hardy (i.e. he plays both twins!).And, in true Tom Hardy style, he brings a newfound excellence to the roles. Just because the twins are (basically) identical, their personalities are definitely not. One is – slightly – cooler and more calculating in his dodgy deals whereas the other one just wants to beat the hell out of anyone who opposes them. Both Krays might as well be played by different actors as Hardy does each of them justice and you'll never be confused as to which one is which.If you already know about the loves and lives of the Kray twins, this film probably won't tell you anything new. However, it's still worth a watch just to see Tom Hardy's take on them (can you tell that I'm a fan?!). Also, if you're generally a fan of gangster films then this one should pretty much tick all the boxes you're looking for. There's probably a reason as to why this is the second highest-grossing British 18 certificate (after Trainspotting) – and that's because it really is a damn good biopic. Okay, they'll always be the questions asked as to how much is made up for the story and how much really happened, but, from what I know about the real life drama, a lot of the major plot points are covered and, whether it all happened exactly as portrayed here, it still makes for an entertaining ride in the gangster genre."
" Hardy again on top of his game
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,7,"I know it's been fashionable to bash this movie, but I thought it was a good watch. Once again, Tom Hardy delivers not one but two awesome acting performances, and kudos to the production crew to make it all look seamless.From what I can ascertain, the film touched on some areas a bit too much (Reggie's relationship with Frances is a key story line), and relegates the boys relationship with their mother to a mere scene or two. Also, Ron's homosexuality is portrayed as quite open, when in fact it wasn't. But that led to a couple of laugh-out-loud lines by Hardy as Ron, and this movie surely needed some humo(u)r.All in all, a decent two-hour viewing experience, and I'm giving it a thumbs up (sorry Roger & Gene)."
