" Absolute non-terrorising hilarious comedy
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,2,Was this a freaking horror flick? Imagine being scared of a ghost called babadook.... Dude this was one hilarious movie. Everytime babadook came I laughed my ass off. People comparing this to shinning need a brain check or they are so sensitive that thrash horror makes them scared. BABADOOK rolf.
" Very unimpressed - had to fast forward
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,1,"This is one of the worst horror movies I have seen lately. It won't scare you for a moment and the low budget is apparent by the very low quality attempts of portraying the 'evil'. Main actress is pretty average, plot moves super slow and overall boring, not even sure why this is classified as horror. Had to fast forward scenes to get to interesting points which were not a lot to be honest"
" A heavyweight horror which demands interpretation
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,"Movies in general, and horror as a genre in particular, can be assessed on one simple metric; namely, emotional impact. Fundamentally, do you react to what you see and hear? The answer for me, in the case of The Babadook, is a categorical 'yes'.On a superficial level, this is a film we've maybe seen before, exploring the cinematically well-trodden terrain of post-partem depression and psychosis, the guilt and grief of a mother, Amelia, left to parent her child under extreme duress and with her support network violently removed. Add to that a child, Sam, who seems set to fully deliver on his early Reagan/Damien-esque promise, and so far so standard.
So what is new here? The clue for me lay in the fact that tonally, the other films which sprang to mind as I watched this (for a second time, I should add) were all rich in allegory; most notably for me, Darren Aronofsky's Mother!, whilst a far more intense watch than this, has the same richly symbolic quality; the sense that what you are seeing demands to be interpreted, decoded. I'll keep my own ideas about it to myself, except to say that like some of the most profound horror, I believe this to be scratching away at global societal themes; Racial violence and genocide, Colonialism, generational strife, reckoning with our cultural demons... Suffice to say that on these grounds The Babadook most certainly has legs; I will definitely revisit this film and it has absolutely left its mark on me, in a way not dissimilar to some of the greats - The Exorcist for example, as bold a claim as that might sound (an explicit reference, in the shape of a shaking bed, is hard to miss). To be clear, this is not quite on the same level, but it's not an unworthy comparison.Artfully crafted, meticulously designed, this film is a classic example of giving back to you what you bring to it as a viewer. Will you find it scary? Not necessarily. Unnerving might perhaps be a better word. But what you read into Amelia's journey with Sam will, I suspect have a whole lot to do with your own experiences. It's just possible that you'll come away from this movie absolutely terrorised. And you will most definitely have questions."
" Too much
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,1,"This is literally the worst movie I have ever seen, the story is trash and there are things that even make adults sick."
" She killed the dog, end of story
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,1,After the dog died this movie was terrible. None of the movies should kill animals.
" Lots of interesting elements, but too silly to do justice to its central theme
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,4,"The Babadook is a family drama featuring a memorable bogeyman, whose true nature is revealed by the end of the film.Things I liked about the film: the concept of the creepy book; the visual references to German expressionism; the reference to Bava's 'Black Sabbath' when the mother floats across the room; the resolution of the film (without wanting to spoil the film, the way the characters deal with the Babadook makes good sense, thematically, as was an unexpected ending).Things I didn't like: whilst the Babadook had a clear metaphorical meaning that made sense, it still had a literal presence in the film as a monster, and this aspect was poorly handled. No parameters were in place around what it was, its powers etc. and so for a significant amount of the movie we just went through the motions of ""supernatural monster stalks family"" as it caused (predictable) havoc. Cheap chills! The other thing I struggled with was the little boy. The actor did such a good job of being so completely unbearably obnoxious and annoying that it made me want to stop watching. It also made me really glad when his possessed mother finally toughed up and put her foot down with him (which was not the intention, I'm sure!)Ultimately the emotional core and metaphor of the movie is dragged down by the general silliness going on around it. The ""horror "" aspects are fairly cliched and inept. I found this film a bit of a chore to get through, to be honest. Lots of good ideas and lots of potential, but it just doesn't come together in a satisfying or entertaining way."
" A Loveletter to Grief
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,8,"I have not read the reviews, didn't have to. This movie was made by someone who has understood what it means having to hide your pain, not to be able to surrender to grief, to hurt out loud. It is not a movie about a monster, it is about loss and duty and how we are required to move on even if we are not ready to do so... This movie is wonderful in that sence. It turns your inner hurt into a real monster and yet still works as a simple horror movie. Even if it's so much more. Go watch this."
" There is no such things as dragon
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,3,"If you've read this story the you know what this movie is all about, probably the best presentation of jungian shadow, the more you ignore your dark side the bigger it gets, you have to face your pain in order to move forward in life."
" Suspenseful psychological thriller
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,7,The majority of the negative reveiws that come from this movie stains from the fact that how it was advertised. it was advertising if you were going to get a monster movie when that is not at all or even what the Babadook stands for. It is about a mother and son coming to grips with the death of the father and a husband and how the mother slowly start to develop a huge sign of depression and stress in the form of insomnia. The son Sam Despise being a kid unfortunately is one of the cons of the movie he just screams and yells constantly throughout the film to the point they start to become excruciating to the audience as well as to the mother. The Babadook well not actually a monster in The traditional sense is the obstacle to overcome and this film and what it actually represents makes sense as you progress through the film.
" A big disappointment
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,3,"I first saw the movie when it came out in the movies. Promising trailer. The trailer was the only good thing about this movie, after all. I almost fell asleep. BORING!"
" OH MY GOD SAMUEL YOU ARE SOOOO ANNOYING!!
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,7,"Incredible movie and concept. Well-done and effective, it talked to my intimate in many moments."
" WHAT EVEN IS THIS?
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,3,How has this got so many great reviews. i really don't get it.
" This is not a standard horror movie, you will not find any jumpscares in this. If you don't scare easily from horror like myself, I'd call it more of a drama.
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,5,"This movie is not what I was looking for, so I'll give it a ""neutral"" 5 stars. I wanted to see some truly spooky stuff, but this is more of a ""see the deep, scary parts of life"" thing."
" Should be a great movie
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,5,"My opinion about this movie!I do understand why some ppl said, this was 1 of the best horror film of all time. Because it's not a cliche horror film with alot of jumpscare. 2/3 part of this film was great,u can feel the horror element around you without a jumpscare.But, at 1/3 part of this film was really boring + the actor was terrible, the boy too overacting. It is like ""The Shining"", good movie but terrible actors.I don't really mind watching a cliche horror film as long as the movie have good actors and good execution rather than watching a movie with terrible actors"
" This kid has put me off kids....
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,1,"The most obnoxious boy ever!! It was painstaking having to watch him.
The mother is just as bad as 7yeqrs after losing her husband she still can't do simple tasks.
It can probably be said that Essie Davies is top notch acting but the character is just so horrendously hate able.
The movie doesn't even have the first ok moment until 49,04minutes!
Waste of my time."
" Stupid
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,2,Stupid film. Spoiler alert. A ghost infiltrates a house through a book. Gets into a woman who then tortures and abuses her son. She vomits the ghost out and then keeps it locked in the basement. And they all live happily ever after!
" Has it's moments ; worth a watch
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,6,Overall the plot is okay. Nothing is done badly. The middle section is probably the strongest section of the film. The end is acceptable but not really impressive. It will spook you but not really haunt you. Overall it is a soild horror but not a must see.
" Horror of the Mind
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,9,"""The Babadook"" isn't your cookie-cutter, fit the genre picture, to an extent it is a movie (like i.e. ""The Sixth Sense"") with a 'twist', and that's where the main viewing focus should be applied, monster itself becomes in this case a support character.To make ""The Babadook"" director Jennifer Kent took the horror genre and bent it to fit her creative vision. ""The Babadook"" is in the first place a movie about going through and recovering from grief, loneliness and depression, only shown through a lens of horror and madness. The movie constantly challenges us with the perception twists, questions our point of view, without holding our hand asks us to decide what is real and what is just an illusion of a poisoned mind.As for the 'horror' aspect of the movie, although it has some scary and intense moments, thrill seekers will be largely disappointed. Like I mentioned before the movie follows it's own rules of conduct, which is also where in my opinion it's greatness comes from. It won't satisfy some viewers, but the ones that 'click' with it will enjoy it."
" Horror movie with psychology
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,9,This is a unique horror thriller because of the character psychology behind it which gives the film a deeper meaning. It's indie feel grounds it and make it very relatable even with it's horror concept.
" This movie is brilliant
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,9,The combination of horror and drama is superb. I've come back to this movie several times and you should give it a try if you never have before.
" Why High Ratings?
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,2,"I don't understand why people are rating this movie so high. It was very boring and should not be considered a horror movie!! I was yawning and trying not to fall asleep the through the whole movie. ""2 Thumbs Down!!"""
" The Boringadook
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,4,"This movie had a couple of ok/interesting moments but those moments are not enough to maintain interest in the film for the full duration.I was pretty keen to see it, the general 'word' around the movie was positive but for me it failed to deliver and I was left wondering what people had seen in it.Make up your own mind for sure but for me you could pass on it."
" Great film, so underated
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,10,"The Babadook makes you feel from the very start as you can see how much the death of the husband and father is impacting on this mother and son. It is clear that this woman's mental health and grief is impacting on her and her son which ultimately introduces the 'Babadook' monster into their lives.The Babadook is definitely a creepy monster that represents what i believe to be the woman's 'mental struggles' and overwhelming grief.The Babadook is a must see, psychological horror movie that will have you hooked from the very beginning."
" Boring and slow
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,1,"Don't think I've ever watched anything more boring, slow and nonsensical.Dumb storyline and horrible acting"
" Psychological drama, not horror
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,1,"Sub par drama film, bad horror. Trying to be different doesn't make it a good film."
" Garbage
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,1,"This movie was not scary, not thrilling or sad except for when they killed that poor dog. Whoever rated this movie high praise is a dang idiot. Home alone 1 was scarier cause ol dude got hit in the nuts and I actually felt that."
" Good For Those Wanting to Have Children
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,4,"This movie is terrible. Just so bad. There is one segment of the population for whom I do recommend this movie. If you're on the fence about having kids, watch this. It'll help you make up your mind. If you don't want to murder the child in this film by the 30 minute mark, you're not human.The Babadook isn't scary, it's too ridiculous. The top hat lol. Who though that was a good idea? The ineffectual mother made me want to throw things at the screen. And as I already mentioned, the kids character in the movie... Well, let's just say I'm cheering for the Babadook to make quick work if the kid."
" One of a kind
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,10,"This film exceeded my expectations.
Worth a watch. The acting and directing was phenomenal.
This one film was interesting and gripping than all the 3 seasons of Stranger Things."
" Great director and actors, but just not the right story for me.
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,4,"It should be clarified that Jennifer Kent is a very good director. Unlike many of her colleagues she appears to have a clear vision and the skills to see it realized on film.
The subject she chose for her feature length debut isn't an easy sell for everyone, though. It deals with depression, mental (in)stability, social pressure, hardships of parenting and the loss of loved ones. The visual style tries its hardest to emphasize all of those aspects, ensuring that the audience can partake in the protagonists' misery. The movie is very efficient in creating a bad mood and that's cause for many overly critical reviews. All of the 1-star ratings are fairly ridiculous and a showcase that people are often entirely incapable of casting fair judgement.My review isn't shedding the best of light on The Babadook either. The actors are great and I can see all of the ways in which Jennifer Kent succeeded in realizing her vision, but when I wasn't annoyed by all of the (intentionally) exaggerated characters, I found myself bored and/or negatively affected by the depressive tone. I guess I was especially disappointed that the movie wasn't as scary as people claimed it would be. There was one moment that started out with much promise but then immediately moved on with fully showing the Babadook and thus annihilated all chances of evoking fear. It never picked up from there.
What hurt the movie the most, was that I never cared for the fates of the two protagonists. They do have character arcs, but those were too subtle for me, especially considering how the movie ends.Hardly any of my criticism counts objectively. It's mostly a subjective disliking."
" Finally watched it... and it is bad
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,3,"I'd put off seeing this movie for years as I hadn't been that impressed by any of the previews I'd seen. Turns out I should have trusted my instincts because it's an incredibly frustrating experience. Bad enough that the child is the most excruciating brat in the history of film but then it devolves into a ham-fisted portrayal of mental instability with a pretty hokey monster thrown in. And not a single decent scare in the entire movie which was a real chore to sit through. If this is the kind of rubbish that gets 98% on RT, my faith in that site is gone for good."
" Complete waste of time!
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,1,Need my hour and a half back. This was a complete waste of time.
" You know what that actually scared me
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,6,"I've not even heard of this film till today so I wasn't really expecting much to be honest. However it pleasantly surprised me. On paper the film actually sounds very bad but it's a decent watch for a horror. It's rare you get a good horror film so a 6 out of 10 is actually quite a good rating. When it called her phone and said baba dook dook dook, that scared the absolute life out of me. Just imagine if apart of your daily routine was to collect worms and feed that monster. I'd be moving house ASAP."
" WHy do people think tihs movies good?
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,5,"I watch alot of horror movies and all kinds of movies. But this is not a good movie, seen it 2 or 3 time to try and see if i missed something that others saw but NO.
Make your own mind up. Plus something funny if you see it is that that mixed in to babadook scream/(scary sound ;) ) is the the sound of the raptors or one of the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park. The are better horror movies out there,
""Sinister"" is one, very good horror movie,"
" The Boreadook
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,5,"A lot of people really seemed to rate this film highly, personally I found it very creative but overall boring.The idea of the book is clever and the actual monster is prominent throughout the film and being based off a children's book makes it even weirder. Tone is upheld as quite good throughout but my main criticism is none of the characters are that likeable and a lot of the film is badly paced and quite frankly boring. I didn't very much like the ending either without spoiling it.5/10: Average horror film, has a lot of creative passion but is overall dull. I don't agree with the abundance of 1 star reviews on here but I can't recommend strongly"
" Is it just me or was this movie called badabook I'm sure it was
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,5,"Is it just me or was this movie called badabook
Is it just me or was this movie called badabook"
" Interesting psychological monster movie
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,6,"This movie is the kind of one that is best when you don't know too much about it beforehand. So I'm not going to explain or interpret the plot too much. But my impression is that it's borderline psychological horror and a monster movie. That works because it creates an unsettling feeling of paranoia where you don't exactly know what's going on.If you only expect a monster movie it can be a little bit letdown, but if you're interested in psychology I recommend the movie because I felt like there might be different ways to interpret the story. Watch it for yourself and think what it might mean."
" A film that follows the great tradition of the Horror genre
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,9,"A single mother, Amelia, struggling with her son's behaviour and death of her husband is gradually drawn into a bizarre children's book fantasy.The look and feel of the the film plays on Amelia's social and emotional isolation. Dark and oppressive in places we are constantly left wondering how much of what we see is real and how much is either down to her imagination. We are at first questioning her deteriorating mental health or is there something supernatural going on.There are elements of the film that feel like social commentary. Amelia's strained relationship with her sister, unrewarding job and inability to form basic relationships, there's a sense of loss that goes beyond the death of her husband. Amelia feels abandoned and separated. The usual social systems in place (school, the police and social services) are deliberately and clinically detached from Amelia's increasingly desperate situation.Into this troubling scenario comes the Babadook, a story book monster that at first seems to be part of Noel's childhood imagination. As this fantasy monster monster manifests itself we are again left asking wether this is part of Amelias mental deterioration?The difficulty in Babadook is the complete lack of sympathy from almost everyone in the film. It's a hard watch in places. As Amelia is still struggling with the death of her husband, we gradually learn that she is unable to properly emotionally engage with anyone. It's heartbreaking to watch.The Babadook is visually stunning. There's barely a frame in the film that doesn't seem to contain a dark corner or presence. There is a persistent threat that runs throughout this movie, every shadow, piece of furniture, mirror or prop could propel itself or suck the characters into some inky shadow.Regular horror movie fans will notice references to some of the great cinema moments of the genre. The film plays homage to the likes of The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari in its expressionist darkness. There are also visual references to The Shining and The Exorcist. Poltergeist and Eraserhead are among a host of other influences. In the tradition of great cinema, The Babadook managed to incorporate these influences in an original and fresh screenplay.I thought of The Babadook as an allegorical piece. The monster, ghost or possessive sprit is depression. It's a story about mental health, the anxiety and depression permeates the story right through to the very end.In the end we realise that the battle with the beast never ends. We are reminded that there is no cure but The Babadook is contained, and controlled. The conclusion to the story could be misinterpreted as leaving the door open to a sequel but I didn't see it like that. Amelia finally moves on from the death of her husband and celebrates Sam's birthday. The demon, however, may not have won but it will never go away.Brilliant film."
" Good horror, excellent actress.
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,7,"Good psychological horror with an excellent performance from Essie Davis. In the last third it lapses into clich矇, and becomes over-reliant on supernatural elements. Also, as a study in parental anxiety and breakdown 'The Babadook' is somewhat overstated. Nevertheless, it's much better than most of the recent films of this genre that I've seen."
" Comedy at its highest.. Hilarious
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,1,Just finished watching this movie.. Did not understood any hype regarding this movie as a good horror.. I have never laughed so hard during a horror movie.. Just hilarious.. Scenes are absolutely comical.. The genre feels like Comedy rather than horror.. Plot is very very weak.. I would have rated 10/10 for Comedy.. Baba Dook dook dook.. Hahahahaha.. 不不不不不不不不
" Different
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,8,"A very different approach to mystery. A more grown up one, I'd say. Topics like depression, unprocessed grief, isolation, loneliness, mental illness, not being able to cope with a mothers daily routine - all this can be more intimidating and terrifying than any demon. And the movie portrayed this, in all its aspects, extremely well. More in the drama genre than the usual horror flick. Nonetheless shocking in some scenes (I only say: mummy, I'm so hungry....) the answer to this...a new dimension of horror."
" Never judge a book by it's cover.....
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,7,"This is actually quite a scary, well constructed, psychological horror thriller from auteur Jennifer Kent. Essie Davis is ""Amelia"" who is delivered of a boy ""Samuel"" (Noah Wiseman) after her husband is killed in a car accident taking her to the maternity ward. The young boy grows up fearful of just about everything, and when the two of them discover a book in their creaky old house entitled ""Mister Babadook"" matters take a turn for the worse and their lives become living nightmares... Davis is good - intense, even - in her role, becoming more maniacal and menacing as their haunting steadily worsens. The direction is well paced using the darkness (in which our creature lives) and some decent visual effects to create a genuine sense of dread. At times, it does border on the hysterical, and she over-acts sometimes, too - but young Mr. Wiseman holds his role together well, and the overall effect is quite affecting."
" Simultaneously good.
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,10,"Mister Babadook only becomes the boiling point of the ordeal. And when it hits to the part of the real scares, it sells well whenever the monster attacks. Instead of loud lazy jump scares, it rather spreads away signs of his presence and its effects to the family. His appearance has more terror if he's lurking in the shadows. It also has a nice use of practical effects to endure its very effective creeps. The performances of the two leads are outstanding for bringing the real heart of the picture. Essie Davis embraces the character, making her fear, depression, and shifting madness all visibly genuine. Same to the young Noah Wiseman who as well gives his character's actions some sense of anxiety.The plot mostly concerns Amelia finding a way to overcome Samuel's behavioral issues and her memories with the accident than dealing with the whole supernatural threat, for sure it is trying to build some slow burn, but even without that horror movie sense, it still feels like they're being tormented by life. It deliberately takes their personal grief seriously, making sure that they actually aren't insane, and nobody else could ever understand what they're going through. This is pretty much the most compelling view of the film, which makes them reasonably trapped into their own nightmares.There was some really good editing throughout, keeping the feel of a fast paced movie while not rushing the story. The kid actor in it does an excellent job of appearing genuinely disturbed but simultaneously good natured.For the other half of the audience though, this is one heck of a ride. I suspect some viewers will get it halfway through, and some two-thirds into the movie. And everyone else won't get it at all. The acting is stunning, the cinematography and lighting are amazing, and I also really like the sound editing (except when they use a sound effect that's clearly from a very old and overused sound library). I found it especially compelling how the movie shifts focus several times during the story, regarding who the villain is."
" DEEPER AND DARKER.
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,7,"I understand the message of the movie, touching on some deeper, darker subjects like depression and loneliness, but it doesn't mean that the ending is any less anticlimactic. Some good tension and buildup in the first act, and some tense scenes and babadook sightings, but in the end it felt a little wasted by the last act."
" Gave Up After 20 Minutes
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,5,"I'd heard lots of good things about this film but, like his Aunt, I *really* couldn't cope with the kid in this. He was beyond irritating and I just couldn't take any more.
Not necessarily a ""horror"" film, but certainly horrible.(NB I've rated it a 5, as I don't think it's fair to give an extreme rating without seeing the whole thing... but I'm certainly not going to do that!)"
" A movie ruined by giving up the mystique and terrible child actor.
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,5,"Another one that is wrongfully praised. Watts was great in it, and the story was good until the end. When dealing with subjects like this, removing doubt removes tension.A stressed out widow, has a terrible son who's played by a terrible child actor. Literally there are scenes when he's throwing a tantrum and then just abruptly stops to seek approval from the director and stage-mom. Watch the car freak out moment, it's SUPER OBVIOUS there.Again, without giving away the movie, the plot was good until the final act destruction of the mystique. Could have been a great story about stress breaking you, but ended up being typical trash."
" A powerful drama with elements of horror
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,8,"This is not a movie about a monster, at least not the standard one from most horror movies. I believe the average viewer will not like the film. It contains a multitude of emotions, from sadness, grief, regret to acceptance. Quite a tense film especially in the third act, and the scary scenes are quite effective because of the play with darkness and because of what we don't see. The film has a strong lesson in the end."
" One of my all-time favourites
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,9,"Honestly, one of the best horror films out there. Not only is it chilling when you watch it the first time but it also has a gripping story with great acting from the son, Samuel and equally from the mother. I've now rewatched it a further times and each time it doesn't fail to capture my emotions as it transforms before you're eyes from a terrifying horror to a hauntingly tragic reality. I will say no more... Truly one to remember in the horror genre."
" Solid 6 to light 7

" All About The Actors
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,7,"I'm not a horror fan per se. Not because I hate them, but because I spend 90% of the time going ""He's behind the door."" ""He's not in there."" ""The music is playing so it's a red herring."". I am in fact a horror fan's worst nightmare and to me most movies reach 5/10 at best. However, I do have to give this 7/10 and that is for two reasons; Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman.Firstly, Essie Davis. Even before the Babadook was introduced I felt her exhausted, bored, strained by her son, nails down a chalkboard desperation to hold it together. I really got frustrated for her, and later in the movie very tired.Secondly, Noah Wiseman. I truly hope this young lad is a star of the future because dear god did I want to kill him. His performance was mesmerising and disturbing; screaming at his mother over things he did, demanding to be read the story of the Babadook, crying over the story of the Babadook, constantly demanding his mum's attention. And yet he still had you cheering for him when he broke his cousin's nose after she bullied him, hitting his mother with a cricket ball when the Babadook has her, and his ingenious traps to capture her and force the creature free..The Babadook itself is pretty disappointing which is surprising on a $2million USD budget and little more that drawing on the screen and mind trickery.In essence, deep down, I think this movie is about a woman having a nervous breakdown and losing it with her son, but I suspect they couldn't make that movie, so thought ""What if we chuck in a creepy creature to make her do these things?"""

" There is no monster!
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,6,"The movie isn't about a ""monster"". It's about living with mental illness. The ""monster"" is the crazy mum who gets these violent episodes and dreams of killing her child. And it's not just a movie. It happens in real life. It happened to me, growing up with a mentally ill and abusive mother.
This movie brought back memories. The writers must have lived it too, as no one else could describe this reality so accurately. The mentally ill would use any excuses in their mind to convince themselves they're innocent and that they're the victim. But that's just their reality. Not THE reality. This is not a scary movie. It's a sad movie."
" Low budget, ok horror.
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,6,"Slow to get started but,
when it does, there's some good scares and a glimpse of a better movie trying to escape.Overall average. Not sure why this is rated quite as high as it is in the modern horror movie suggestions.Plus, really can't forgive that WTF ending."
" Good but not great
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,6,"THE BABADOOK is a pretty engaging slice of horror from Australia, very much low key for the most part and the more effective because of that. It's a familiar story about a single mother and her boy finding themselves subjected to a picture book creation called the Babadook. The film tends to work better as a story of mental illness and psychological instability than it does a supernatural slice of horror, but for the most part it walks the tightrope quite well. The only letdown is at the climax, when all of a sudden it veers into ridiculous INSIDIOUS territory and becomes very Hollywood, riffing on the likes of POLTERGEIST, GHOSTBUSTERS and THE EVIL DEAD in a matter of minutes. Still, a solid performance from Essie Davis as a rather unlikeable lead and a winning turn from an initially unpleasant child is enough to make this work, although it'd not quite the masterpiece you'd heard."
" Genuine Terror
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,10,"Chilling and Sad.Ignore the One-Stars!
Never written a review before. Haven't felt the need. But after seeing the 1 star reviews of this film,i just felt compelled.Firstly,what this is.I would say a cross between The Shining and We Need to talk about Kevin. This film is desperately sad. A woman who is haunted,first by her husbands death,then by the Babadook all while looking after her young son. This is a creepy, no jump scare, fantastic psychological horror. A rare gem that plays on all those fairytale fears that you may have had as a kid.Second.What this isn't.Well,not ""The worst horror in years"".I get that people have different opinions.I do.But this isn't a film that can justify that sort of nonsensical comment. It isn't a dull jump scare-filled blockbuster. The characters are not hot teenagers. They are believable, disturbed and this makes the film the slow,creeping horror that it is.If you are a fan of horror,it really is a must see film"
" How is this movie getting good ratings?
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,1,"Seriously, how did this movie get the ratings that it has?! This movie SUCKS."
" So what is the babadook!!??
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,6,"I purposely never watched the trailer for this one so didn't know what to expect.This had moments when it made my blood go cold! The noises are frightening sometimes and the screaming is awful! But then I see the babadook and I'm like ok what? What the F is it? I get it's a demon,but what does it want? In the end it hides in the basement and they are feeding it worms!!The scene with the dog was a low point for me. I was expecting it coz it forsees that happening in the book when it reappeared but I was in total denial it was gonna happen. Then she turns the tv off and looks at the dog and I knew what was coming. I almost called it a day then but I saw it through.Overall it was decent enough. Scared me just the right amount."
" Not sure who can find this movie scarry
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,2,"If you get scared at anything, you may find this a horror movie. Otherwise, nothing really happens, there are even a few funny moments but definitely not scary. There is no writing or story line, just a kid and his mother. The acting cannot even be rated as there is not much really. Overall, a very bad horror movie if you can call it horror."
" A lot of Promise, Almost Delivers
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,7,"This movie isn't as much about your typical ghosts, monsters, or demons. It's about the grief of a young mother and the long term misunderstanding of her son who have lost their husband and father in a car accident on the day of the son's birth. Long before the antagonist begins to play a role in this story, it is clear that both the mother and son are a bit unhinged from either the loss of a husband, or growing up without a father. The Babadook book suddenly appears on the sons bookshelf, and that is when things start to seem a little off. But going forward with the story the mother takes a dip into madness reminiscent of Jack Torrance in the Shining and the line between delusion and reality become suddenly blurred.The acting in this movie is fantastic. Totally immersing you in the roles of the mother and son and if anything is completely unnerving it is the completely convincing portrayal of insanity in this movie. The use of sound and light leaves you guessing, and keeps you wondering what is always lurking in the corner.SPOILER AHEADThis movie may have deserved 8 stars in my book. However, any time you kill off the dog, you are gonna lose some points in my book. The killing of the dog is foreshadowed early on, as are the deaths of other characters. They killed the dog, but not the rest. I would have preferred the other way around."

" How to not raise your child {Exclusively for Sickos}
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,1,"There are B movies which don't take themselves seriously, have an over-the-top premise, Simple Characters, Okayish VFX, Low-Mid level budgets and But never fail to entertain. I appreciate such films and makers behind. Sometimes, even major studios also follow them to deliver entertainment. I enjoy such films as well. On the other hand, there are films with a believable premise, Interesting Characters, Good VFX and Mid-High Level Budgets. They too turn out great.
And then comes some filmmakers with dumb premises being forced upon viewers as something serious and intelligent with completely Non-Likable Characters and High level budgets. They'll go to any extent to push the film as an intelligent work, even to the lengths of Buying off Critics. ""The Babadook"" come into this category.
The atmosphere of this film is very depressing making this a hard watch and very disturbing. Adding to it, it has characters that we don't care about.
There are only three main characters in this film :- Mom, Son and The Babadook.Son:- This little guy is born on the same day his father dies. He is very creative and believes in Monsters. Not so uncommon in a 6 year old kid. He listens to his mom's bedtime stories every night before he sleeps. So, what is so unlikable about this character?
He believes in Monsters so much that he even makes weapons to kill them. He even takes them to his school endangering the lives of other kids. He never listens to his mother. He does dangerous stunts like climbing on top of an Outdoor Swing. He can't even keep calm and annoys other kids. When the other kids resent, he even assaults them.Mom: She is a single mother. She faces very hard time to pull through life and take care of her only child. She completely fails as a mother as she couldn't teach her son anything about morals/values/discipline. All she does is reading Bedtime stories to him at night. On the top of that, when her son brings a random book named ""Babadook"", she behaves so irresponsibly and opens it and reads it to him, only to know that it's not kids friendly. Though she later closes it, she should've personally seen that before she read. She never throws her kid's dangerous tools away (including a wooden gun). Instead, she lets him keep them. The most annoying thing about her is she never ever slaps her kid despite he being so mischevious. {I'm an Indian and I'm grateful to my Mom for slapping me when I was messing around as a kid. As a result, I had a wonderful childhood :)}The Babadook: So, When both the characters are so annoying, we can only hope for the Babadook to save this film. Disappointingly, we don't even get to see the Babadook. His Modus operandi is very confusing. At one point of time, he comes like a Man with a Black suit and a hat. Other times, he comes as some bat like creature. He even comes like the deceased husband. To say that all appearances of the Babadook are Cringeworthy is an understatement. Simply put, The Babadook has no character whatsoever.Now, let's talk about the atrocious things done by the characters and some annoying moments:1. Why can't the Mom take her Child to a doctor, when he behaves so fanatically?2. When the kid hugs her, why does she shouts at him to not to do that?3. When the School Correspondents advice her that her son should be kept seperately for his own good, why didn't she agree? They correctly say that he's a threat to other students.4. Why did she allow his kid to carry around dangerous weapons like a wooden Gun which shoots nails and Cork Balls?5. When she herself witnessed a sinister presence, why didn't she rush for help? She could've gone to a church father or a paranormal investigator/ deamonologist.6. When the book returns to her, why didn't she take it to a police station in the first place? Why after burning it? Is she a 5th grade kid?7. What the hell is the book ""Babadook""? Who wrote it? What does he want? What's his Modus operandi? Nothing was shown interestingly.8. Last Act: This is one of the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in a film. Just like The Shining, the Mom goes crazy and tries to kill her own child. But unlike The Shining, where we wish that the kid should escape, I never felt an iota of sympathy for this kid. Because, he stabs his mom with a kitchen knife. Beats the S**t Outta her with some kinda baseball bat and ties her up with rope, literally putting the likes of Superman to shame. Why does he tie her up? So that she could fight the Babadook and release him from her head. Wow. A 6 year old kid figured out everything on his own.Kudos. Somehow she manages to get rid of Babadook and The Babadook also cooperates with her. They kinda come to some terms and according to that pact, The Babadook goes into a basement behind staircase and the mom locks the door. What did i watch?9. Why, in the first place, she starts feeding the Babadook? How does she figure out that he preys on earth worms? Why the hell didn't she go to a priest, atleast now, to get rid of it completely?10. Poorly written neighbouring old woman character. I wish she turns out as a Hero in the film. But nothing was written as such. So shame!!!With disturbing atmosphere, Non-Likable Characters and their Irrational behaviours, The Babadook takes itself too seriously & tries so hard to be a path-breaking horror film.Whereas, in reality, it's just another horror film that's not only a bad one but equally disturbing to watch.PS: In the scene where the kid pushes his cousin off from a wooden house, I wanted to stop watching this film. But, I continued to watch, only to make sure that this film is as bad as I predicted. It turns out to be much worse."
" Genuinely terrifying.
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,9,"Certainly not mainstream horror and that's not the only good point about it...
An example of what can be achieved when cheap jump scares and loud music aren't the only things On which a director relies.
A story of how ignoring or denying that something exists, a problem or unspoken difficulty within a household can become something too big and dangerous to handle.
Even if you don't appreciate the eerie imagery, the atmosphere created by a broken home and mother at the end of her rope will immediately put you in an off state, one of unease. This is played up perfectly and creates sustained, palpable tension.
When the metaphorical, supernatural element is added to this volatile mix, the end results are a genuinely terrifying mix of reality and non-reality which puts you in the mind of the struggling mother's psyche.
Watch and enjoy your evening with the lights on!"
" the kind of movie you'd want to watch twice
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,10,"This movie was terrible in all the best ways, so grim and dark and hopeless at times. The acting is phenomenal and feels real the whole way through. Real sense of dread throughout, good decision to not show the monster. If you look deeper into the film, it's less of a horror movie and more of a drama documenting grieving, the grieving is just personified as the babadook. Great movie if you want to watch something that will really make you think and really, you could think about the meaning of the film anyway you see fit."

It does a wonderful job of giving you an inside look inside the main character's minds and shows the mother's slow, terrifying drive to madness. The plot twist at the end still had me guessing weeks after I had watched the movie. The Babadook does a terrific job twisting and turning through plot twists, suspenseful scenes, and cliffhangers. It is definitely a must see!"

" Not For Me
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,6,"Obviously well made and Davis gives a performance for the ages, but this one didn't grab me like it did other people. The annoying child didn't help. The title creature was better off creeping around in the shadows."
" This is the kind of new thinking that will keep the genre fresh
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,9,"Amelia(Davis, completely convincing when threatening, when overworked, and when sweet. While this may be the first thing I see her in, it definitely won't be the last) lost her husband 7 years ago. She has not really processed this pain. Part of this is that she has no support system. And as callous as it may seem to admit, something that contributes to this circumstance is her son, born on the night of his death, as he was driving her to the hospital to deliver. His name is Samuel(Wiseman, immensely talented for his age), and he is high maintenance. He's obsessed with the idea of a monster, under his bed or in his closet, constructing multiple ranged weapons(!) to defeat it, and promising that he will protect his mom from it. How long can this hard-working single parent put off grieving? And might there be serious consequences to doing so? In fact, is that why the titular monster starts tormenting the pair?This is courageous enough to tackle not only one, no, two, taboo subjects: mourning, and when ""motherhood is anything but a perfect experience for women"". Obviously, handling these without creating something deeply offensive will require a deft hand, a strong understanding of psychology, and a lot of emotional maturity. Thankfully, writer-director Jennifer Kent has all three to spare(for me, she's up there with Patty Jenkins as the best female directors out there, and whose future work I eagerly await). There are so many ways in which this movie could have failed completely, and she steers clear of all of them. Though you may not realise from when you first start watching this, there is a tremendous amount of empathy flowing through this picture. It's not interested in pointing fingers or assigning blame. It carefully avoids being mean-spirited, and what may at first glance appear to be exploitative, you later find to be necessary for the exploration of the themes. This is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen, creating terror through careful sound design.This contains a little sexuality and strong language, and some bloody violence that may not be plentiful, yet is intensely effective. I recommend this to everyone that the concept appeals to. 9/10"

While I did have a hard time maintaining interest in the movie the entire time on the first watch through, I found myself much more into the story the second go around when I could really look at things from another point of view. If the first viewing had been as entertaining I think the movie would be rated higher for me, but the enjoyment is there nonetheless."
" Such a bad movie, boring, obvious what is going to happen
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,1,"This movie seems like it's dying for help, the jumpscares are scary just because of the silence and that just repeats over and over until it's annoying. It honestly feels like an 11 year old made the script. It's so easy to realize what is going to happen in the future, the kid is so annoying, this movie brings absolutely nothing new in the horror universe in fact it's just a cheap stealing show from the bigger horror movies. I couldn't wait for the movie to end to be honest and felt completely disappointed and like I had just lost half and hour of my life. Sorry."

",2020-07-27 00:00:00,1,"By minute 5 you'll want the freaking monster to appear and kill both the protagonists, that's how irritable they are. The monster is actually something I was looking to see so he could blood-puree both these insipid , annoying, bratty characters.Any scriptwriter knows the 'save the cat' rule - make your characters likeable somehow, so that no matter how monstrous they are in the rest of the movie, we can associate with them. From there we'll laugh, cry and fear with them.Babadook's writers clearly didn't read 'save the cat' and made a horrible mess of a movie in the result. I feel for the rest of the team who had to associate with this nonsense."

One great part I noticed is the sound editing, which is astutely crafted throughout.Essie Davis does terrific in the role of Amelia, she shows every emotion that her character is feeling nicely - I felt her pain initially with the kid, too. Noah Wiseman plays her son, Samuel. He is actually quite impressive given his age, there are a few scenes where he adds a fair deal to them.It's hearty, suspenseful and attempts proper horror as opposed to forcing things like jump scares, which I will always praise a production in this genre for.

" The Horror From Down Under
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,8,"When the Australian horror film ""The Babadook"" was released here in the U.S. in November 2014, 10 months after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, it was moderately successful at the box office and received almost universal praise from the critics. Somehow, I managed to miss the film back then (I happen to miss most new releases, actually, in my quest to see as many great classic/old films on the big screen as possible at NYC's several revival houses), but have wanted to see it ever since, especially inasmuch as the film holds an almost unprecedented 98% approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website! A recent showing on one of the Showtime stations has finally enabled me to catch up with this truly frightening picture, however; one that has grown into something of a cult item and cause celebre since its release six years ago. I knew absolutely nothing about the film when I sat down to watch it the other night, had no idea what a ""babadook"" was, and felt a bit concerned about possibly not being able to follow those Aussie accents (a stumbling block for me in the past), but you know what? I found myself quite loving this marvelously scary and emotionally moving picture, and can now understand what all the fuss has been about. (And those accents, as it turned out, were not a problem here, either!)As many others have already discovered, the film introduces us to a lonely widow named Amelia Vanek (remarkably well played by Tasmanian actress Essie Davis), a worker in a nursing home who lives with her 6-year-old son Sam (Noah Wiseman) in a suburb of Adelaide, in South Australia. We learn that on the day Sam was born, Amelia's husband, Oskar (Ben Winspear), had been killed in a car crash while driving her to the hospital. Can you imagine? Now, as Sam's 7th birthday/the anniversary of her husband's death approaches, Amelia finds herself once again trying to subsume the pain. She has pushed away the grief and refused to deal with her loss over the years, we sense, and this state of denial will lead to horrific events as the film proceeds. Sam, we also see, is a child who lives in perpetual fear of monsters, even going so far as to cleverly construct weapons (such as dart throwers and rock catapults) against them. So it is perhaps not the wisest idea for Amelia to be constantly reading him horrific bedtime stories. On this one night, she reads to him from a particularly disturbing pop-up book called ""Mister Babadook""; a pop-up book that has popped up in the house from out of nowhere. The Babadook monster in this book is a singularly gruesome creature, a top-hatted figure with talons (supposedly based on the Lon Chaney character in 1927's lost film ""London After Midnight"") who will come to your house, after making itself known by thumps and knocks, make your life miserable, and eat your insides out! Shortly thereafter, Sam's mania about the creature reaches a fever pitch, to the point where Amelia finds it necessary to sedate him. She tears the pop-up book to shreds and throws it away, only to find it reassembled and sitting on her doorstep one morning! Strange knockings and thumpings are heard in the house, she finds glass in her food, a roach infestation is discovered in her kitchen, and, in perhaps the film's most chilling scene, the Babadook itself is seen at night, hovering on her bedroom ceiling. After many sleepless nights, Amelia begins to crack, and her personality begins to alter, as the audience wonders whether or not she is just irritable and exhausted, or if perhaps she is beginning to undergo a personality change; a possible possession. It is only when she begins to verbally and then physically threaten her son that the viewer understands that she has indeed been taken over by the Babadook, and that Sam's suspicions about the entity have been correct all along....""The Babadook"" was the first full-length film by Australian director Jennifer Kent, based on her own short film of 2005, simply entitled ""Monster"" (this short film accompanies the longer film in its DVD incarnation, I've heard, and I would love to take a look at it one day), and most viewers, I have a feeling, will find it remarkable that Kent both wrote and directed the 2014 film, so very accomplished an effort is this debut. Kent's script is a wonder, and her direction is very self-assured and stylish. Her film can be seen and understood on several levels, a fact that has apparently been the subject of lively debate during these past six years. On a surface and simpler level, we can see the Babadook as merely a monster that possesses Amelia and causes her to threaten her child. But on a deeper and more plausible level, the Babadook can be understood as the manifestation of Amelia's repressed grief; of all the unresolved feelings that she has refused to deal with over the years. Not for nothing does the Babadook take the form of her deceased husband Oskar at one point; not for nothing is the monster ultimately shown to be impossible to slay, but only amenable to confinement. So yes, the film is much more than just another mindless monster movie. Kent has lots to say here about the mother/child relationship, about grief and its aftermath, and about how we move on in life after a tragedy. ""I want to create a myth in a domestic setting,"" Kent was quoted as saying after the film's release, a statement that one can read as one wishes, regarding the Babadook's being an actual monster or merely a manifestation of Amelia's grief. Fortunately, the film works extremely well on either level.And Kent is abetted here by a raft of very fine performances, particularly from her two leads. Little Noah Wiseman is very fine and affecting as the disturbed child Sam, and Essie Davis is just amazing as Amelia, giving an Oscar-caliber bit of thesping here in a portrayal that demands much of her. She makes us feel Amelia's grief and loneliness just by the expressions on her face when she sees a happy couple necking in a car, or when she sits in her living room watching television by herself. Her Amelia is a beautiful woman, with a kind of Michelle Pfeiffer quality, but one who is beginning to look decidedly frayed by the cares and woes of her existence. Davis is equally compelling, however, when she starts to become possessed by the Babadook, and her foul-mouthed, threatening and ultimately murderous tantrums are really something to behold. It is a tremendous performance, truly, that runs the gamut of emotion, and Davis is fully invested in it.""The Babadook"" is a film with any number of startling moments that will leave the viewer slack jawed and chilled. Besides the aforementioned one, with the title creature hovering on the bedroom ceiling, we have the one in which Amelia yanks out one of her own teeth that had been paining her (a scene reminiscent of the one in 2006's ""Bug,"" which I had recently watched); the scene in which Amelia loses control of her car, after it has been infested with cockroaches; the one in which she vomits black bile in a copious flood; the one with Oskar's return; and really, the entire final half hour of the film, with Amelia and her son playing a cat-and-mouse game with each other throughout the house. And in a film with so much in the way of shocks and chills, how appropriate is it that Amelia, at one point, is shown to be watching, on her TV, one of the scariest scenes of all time, the one with the hideous hag in Mario Bava's ""Black Sabbath"" (1963)? William Friedkin, the director of the film that many consider to be the ne plus ultra of horror, 1973's ""The Exorcist,"" has since gone on to declare, regarding ""The Babadook,"" ""I've never seen a more terrifying film,"" and that should tell you something right there. But of all the shocks and scares in the film, none can compare with the sight of Amelia, who we have seen to be a loving and caring mother, as she begins to transform into a hate-filled and homicidal creature, as the Babadook, the essence of her concentrated and undealt-with emotions, begins to overwhelm her. Could anything be more frightening than the sight of a once-loving parent changing into...something else? Fortunately for all concerned, Amelia is able to, uh, work through her issues, and confine the Babadook to a place where it can be controlled.Kent's film closes on a sweet and hopeful note, leaving the viewer trusting that the Vaneks will go on to enjoy a happy life, and that perhaps Amelia will find herself a boyfriend with her kindly coworker Robbie (Daniel Henshall). The film is surely left wide open enough for a possible sequel, which apparently the author's fans have been clamoring for all these years, to Kent's adamant refusal. And you know what? Perhaps it's just as well to leave things as they are, with the Babadook safely tucked away where it can do no harm...."
" it's a good film directed with slow and terrifying momentum.
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,8,"One of those con-temporal multi-layered horror films, refreshing the genre. The Shining influence is quite obvious. creepy and very interesting. It delivered from each aspect from the acting to the scares to the mother-son relationship. I had one problem with it's ending but other than that it was quite an experience. Refreshingly terrifying. 8/10"
" a great movie about grief and moving on, and about how we accept ourselves. forget the bad reviews, the film is great, just not your ""normal"" horror flick. i can relate to it.
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,8,"Now, i would love to make this review without spoilers. but...well what is the babadook? the babadook represents moving on. it represents our demons and how we manage them. before the babadook Amelia was in denial with her life: she couldn't accept what she was now. her son. her dead husband. the people around her. she thought she was coping well but she wasn'tthe babadook is about how we cope with our inner demons. how we deal with them and confront them. Amelia tried to hide them since her son was born. she was never able to deal wih the fact that her life couldn't be the same anymore. that her son needed specific attention. that her husband was not there. the babadook was her way to cope with all of her inner pain. that's why he is now in the basement. that's why Samuel is finally having a birthday party: she was able to fight with her inner demons, to (literally)spit them out - and by doing so, she solved her emotional luggage. it's still there because pain never goes away, but now it's controlled. the babadook was her way to realize she never moved on. was her way to finally start moving forward.so many things we might not talk about in our life. not only someone we love that is dead, but some incident we feel ashamed or sad, bullying, one of our failures... and we don't talk about it. then it slowly becomes a huge thing because we were never capable to deal with it. the babadook is that: is our inner pain that we keep kinda sleeping but in the right moments it comes to attack us. this was her process to overcome these conflicts. being set around the time of the accident is very accurate because it's the time where she remembers everything the most. and she feels the most pain.the movie doesn't want to explain everything, even though everything it's in the movie. but if you're used to see ""horror"" as some jumpscares with all the plot explained is normal you won't enjoy this that much. like in aster or eggers movies horror here is just the way to communicate what this is about: if it was a drama about a grieving mom that can't deal with her own life and ""peculiar"" son it wouldn't be as interesting. by having an horror twist into it you can make those demons real. and make the public scared, because there is some scary stuff here.so a technically great film with cool interpretations and a very accurate and deep metaphor. i liked this very much and i can relate very hard to it: if he was alive it would have been the 67th birthday of my father, on june 11 - i finished watching this already after midnight but for me it's still june 11. somehow it makes me feel it's not a coincidence. one thing i'm certain: everyone will have babadook moments in their lives. sometimes pain is inevitable. sometimes it will hurt. and it won't be about how we fight it. it woulbe about how we will accept it.it's well shot, and the sound effects are awesome. i liked both of the main actors and also the characters. the kid is annoying sometimes but he is human. the mom falls into the verge of madness but at the end of the day her son, her family is able to save her from herself."
" A Great Indie Film
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,9,"I really like films that have a unique story to them. This film was suspenseful and eerie. The kid was a bit annoying but you learn why later on. I really like the pacing of this film and enjoyed the fact that they told a different story, not like other horror films I've seen in the past.I recommend this film to those who want to see something a little different."
" Do not watch this movie!!!!
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,1,Wasted an hour 35 min of my life watching this low budget movie that has no ending whatsoever.
" Do Not Look In This Book...
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,10,"THE BABADOOK opens with a terrible accident. Seven years later, Amelia (Essie Davis) is raising her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman) alone, while working at an elder care facility. Both remain devastated by the loss of their husband / father in the aforementioned tragedy. While Amelia has fallen into a deep depression, Samuel has become obsessed with protecting her, fearing that she could die at any moment. Samuel also exhibits some peculiar behaviors, resulting in his being pulled from school. Amelia is beside herself, unsure of what to do or where to turn.In the middle of all this, a strange book seems to simply appear in Samuel's bedroom. It looks like a child's pop-up book, so Amelia reads it to Samuel one night, and odd things start happening. What begins as a few weird but explainable occurrences, becomes increasingly menacing and dangerous. Are Amelia and her son being stalked by a supernatural entity, or is she just losing her grip on reality?Channeling elements and atmosphere from several, past genre classics, this film manages to incorporate them without being derivative. Ms. Davis is astonishing, shifting from terrified victim to terrifying threat with ease. The story can be viewed as a supernatural horror tale, a psychological thriller, or both. Part of what sets it apart is its emotional depth. It seems to have the greatest impact on viewers who have themselves suffered tragic loss. It is, at its core, about catastrophic loss, crippling sorrow, and eventual acceptance. A triumphant horror movie..."
" 3.5/10
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,3,"I really don't get why this movie has the praise it got. People saying its one of the scariest horror films? That really confuses me, the book or Mr. Babadook doesn't really do anything scary or more does things that are overdone to death in other horror flicks. The movie kinda reminds me of The Shining, with the kid being Danny and the mother being a mixture of Jack and Wendy. Speaking of the kid, he is really annoying throughout the film. Overall, the film is not scary AT ALL, it's kinda bland and it's not anything worth watching again"
" Midnight Rambling!
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,7,"The Babadook is a terrific debut feature for writer/director Jennifer Kent. On a limited budget, she has produced a work of genuine originality, whilst operating ostensibly in the horror genre. Crucial to the success of the film is lead actress Essie Davis, who gives a fantastic performance as, lonely, grieving widow Amelia, whose own depressed state, is only exacerbated by the obnoxious and anti-social behaviour of her extremely needy 6 year - old son, Samuel.Much of the film is shot in Amelia's and Samuel's house, but the movie never feels in the least bit stagey. It was interesting reading Kent's comments that she originally envisaged deliberately fostering a 1950's set look, even considering filming in black and white to highlight the anachronistic feel. I'm personally glad she changed her mind over that concept and I think the skilful work of Polish cinematographer Radek Ladczuk, put the final seal on adopting any retro-look. The camera swings, tracks and zooms in and out of the Babadook's adopted residence, snake-like in it's character-revealing intent. The sound editing too is first-class. It always enhances the bleak, moody atmosphere and suspense quota, without inserting overpowering effects aiming for cheap jump shocks.The Babadook is not flawless by any means. For whatever reason, Samuel is just established from the outset, as a complete brat. Thereafter, it becomes rather difficult for even the most compassionate of viewers to feel much sympathy for him. There's very much a repetition factor happening as well. We already are witness to the fact that he drives his mother towards exhaustion and exasperation by getting her up every night and eventually climbing into her bed. So there's not much happens that's different after the supposedly terror - inducing Mister Babadook book is discovered and read.On a less significant level, Australian homes virtually never have the North American - like basement that is seen in the movie, crucial though it is to the plot. And I tend to agree with quite a few other reviewers that the conclusion appears to have escaped Kent somewhat. In the context of the rest of the film, there just seemed to be a sudden injection of unneeded special effects and Samuel's role in the way things panned out, seemed to me, to be rather ludicrous, considering his age and earlier behaviour.But too reiterate, The Babadook is a very good initial outing for Jennifer Kent and I look forward to seeing her second production The Nightingale, about which, I've also heard really good things. Meanwhile appreciate The Babadook for what it really is. A clever, multi-layered story about how incredibly difficult being a parent to a troubled child can be. And it's all dressed up as a ""horror movie"". Who would have thought?"
" I loved it. It's crazy intriguing, great build-up and the ending is very original.
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,"For everyone out here saying this film isn't ""scary,"" the Babadook isn't a typical horror film. This is a psychological horror film, the Babadook represents the grief she has refused to accept or acknowledge for years. The Babadook left me in tears by the end of the film. Being someone who has lost someone close to me, I felt deeply moved by this movie. I have never felt so connected to a film before. The actors did a phenomenal job, and Kent did a truly incredible job portraying the monster grief can become if not dealt with properly."
" really gets in your head..
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,9,"This movie got me so messed up. First i want to give full credits to the actors, like all the actors were really good. The storyline is so interesting. the more you pay attention the more you begin to see that the mom is the babadook, like the time were she was in the bathtub with her clothes on, when she stood up i got chills because she looked exactly like him. At first i was really annoys by Samuel. But in the end I was really rooting for him actually, he tried to help his mom the best he could and i respect that... My interpretation is that the mom is still 'grieving' about her husband, she sees him sometimes in the babadook. She is scared of herself, she doesn't want to forget him but she also knows she has to move on for a healthy environment for her kid to grow up in. I really liked how in the beginning of the movie we were already informed that Sam likes to make 'toy weapons' Later in the movie this was actually really handy plus it all made sense because we were constantly reminded with it. The only thing that isn't physically possible is for Sam to grab his unconscious mom and tie her up. I don't even think I could do that. For how great this movie is i expected a lot from the ending. I hate it when they add another to another to another problem. Like he's dead, but not yet, but now he is, or not. Like end it jeez. Dynamics in the end were so bad... in the rest of the movie they were fine so i don't know what went wrong there. So conclusion: Storyline, really good. Actors, just wow. Music, Actually so interesting and ominous. Ending, kinda meh. I would definitely watch this movie again!"
" A superior horror movie!
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,9,"The Babadook (2014) (spoilers)This is a superior horror movie. It's extremely intense and very well-made. The actors in it are outstanding. Great acting can suck you into a movie like nothing else about the production can. You watch Amelia, the mother, played by Essie Davis, with a growing mix of fascination, apprehension and terror as she slowly descends into madness. It's like something out of Edgar Allan Poe, arguably the best horror writer of all. The best horror is the kind that reminds of our fallen and vulnerable condition living in a world ruled by the devil, something Poe (and the makers of this movie) was very good at. Also, great horror makes you care about the person or persons who are being subjected to it. And you care about Amelia deeply. You care because you understand that she's vulnerable and helpless and therefore susceptible to the power of the devil who comes to her here in the form of the Babadook, a demonic character in a children's book.You care about Amelia and you care about her son Samuel. In fact, he ends up melting your heart. Samuel is played by Noah Wiseman who is every bit as talented as Haley Joel Osment (he of ""The Sixth Sense"" fame) was. At first Samuel is annoying. He is disobedient and hard-headed and extremely needy. But once the demon, the Babadook, invades their home, Samuel, frail and small though he is, is the only one who can help free the home from the evil attacker.
The Babadook is a tale about demon-possession and about a love that understands deep things and knows no limits. Children are like that in the way they love. Samuel is like that:Samuel: I know you don't love me. The Babadook won't let you. But I love you, mom, and I always will.One of the sad things about Amelia's and Samuel's predicament is that they are utterly alone in their misery. Their friends have deserted them, leaving them to face their formidable foe on their own. When Amelia goes to the police station to tell the police about the Babadook and what he has been doing, the officers look at her like she's a crazy person. No one can help her and her son.This movie reminded me of other movies. In ""The Sixth Sense"", the little boy, Cole, is the only one who can see dead people. In ""The Babadook"", at first, Samuel is the only one who knows that the demon is real. The movie is also like ""The Shining"", but instead of the father and husband, Jack Torrance, losing his mind, it's the mother. And, finally, the images and pictures in the children's book brought to mind the movie ""Coraline""."
" Good horror film
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,7,"Oh so now I know where the ""why can't you just be normal"" meme came from. Also another movie which persuaded me to not have kids."
" I hate the kid
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,10,I love this film but that kid is so annoying other than that its a great film to watch specially if you love a good horror film
" This movie revitalised my faith in horror cinema
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,9,"This is one of those movie where I will never forget my first time watching it.
It left a big impact.When it seemed like no good horror movies were coming out, this movie revitalised my faith in horror cinema.Such an uncomfortable viewing experience.Essie Davies is incredible."
" Such a shame....
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,5,"This movie had a lot of potential. Not enough scares, that could have been released mine opinion... Lak of special effects and thrills."
" Just because I give it a 10 star review doesn't mean I think it's flawless
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,9,"I have a few minor issues but for me I rate films in percentages. I gave this a 95%.
So first my issues:
1) there's a very abrupt and strange line that gives expedition
2) Some of the extras aren't the best actors/actresses
3) There's an edit that shows a very strange continuity error.
4) (my biggest issue) sometimes the script is a bit 'on the nose' at the beginning.
For me that's it
I definately think you should watch it. The main actor and actress are great. The 2 main characters are very well fleshed out. It's fantastically directed. Dream sequences actually feel like they have a purpose. There are no jump scares at all. The ending makes sense if you piece stuff together. Every scene has this sense of sadness. And it's genuinely terrifying."
" Not all that!
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,2,"I just saw this today on Comcast, since I have a free premium week, and it wasn't as good as say, The Omen. Even the latter is just okay because of the better acting by Lee Remick and Gregory Peck.This story deals with mental illness, which is supposed to manifest in the minds of both mother and irritating boy of maybe 5 years? The mother seems possessed by The Babadook, and maybe she is the personification of the title character, but most of the time she or her little brat are just screaming and no one cares about any of them. What if the actual Babadook would have actually come to life and caused real terror to this 2 person household or maybe their entire neighborhood! That would require quite the imagination of the writer and director to make it unbearable.It's difficult to make a really good horror film in general. The Bair Witch Project was rather dull until the last 15 minutes, which saved the film. You need to have something truly disturbing, even just one scene, to captivate people.Alien did it with the one shock scene and a true sense of dread. The same could be said for Salems Lot. Rosemary's Baby was disturbing for when she asks: ""What did you do to his eyes?"" in the last scene. At least you have to have something which people will remember for a long time."
" Ba-ba-boring...
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,3,"I expect it to be a good movie, i really wanted to be a good movie but in the final i remained only with disappointment.The characters are extremely annoying and i couldn't care less about them if anything happened to them. The story itself makes the characters bland and forgettable. This movie wanted to present mother's grief after that horrible accident and the distancing between her and her son, but in the end it only manages to confuse people inducing random action, hard to watch and stupid moments and i felt like the acting was really off. The ending makes no sense, and that creature? How did that book appeared randomly in the house and after she read it the monster appeared? And more importantly how she ""magically"" beat that creature with that ""heartwarming speech""? We will never know.This movie had potential but in the end it fails in his own cliches and random illogical action. I had hope but in the end i remained only with frustration and confusion."
" Chills down my spine
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,8,Saw this on Netflix and it was terryfying. One of my favorite modern horror films.
" Truly awful
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,1,I watched the movie. Bad acting. Truly awful. The mother and son want to kill each other. The poor dog. They must have drank the water. Low budget?
" Terrible
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,1,Worst horror movie I have ever seen. All it is is screaming and yelling. The babadook would be freaking great if writing properly.
" Terible
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,1,"Very, very stupid film! But is good to watch so you can belive someting like that exist.
Too long, too slow and so......."
" Nothing new, but still done well
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,7,"While The Babadook does not really bring any new ideas to the table, it is a well executed film and is certainly worthy of your time."
" One of the best horror movies in years
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,8,"In the last 5 years-heck make it 10 years-there are three horror movies of note: Get Out, It Follows, and this film. The key thing that elevates these above all others is the fact that the ""monster"" isn't just some subhuman, unstoppable killing machine. It has moral, ethical and emotional components-in other words the psychology of our own fears. Here it includes the fears many single mothers have that they can't raise their child alone and effectively keep him ""safe,"" combined with the survivor's guilt and intense grief at the loss of a loved one. These things are monstrous and can eat you alive (from your dark insides out). Great acting by the two leads and very good direction from its writer/director."
" Scared me a lot
",2020-03-11 00:00:00,7,"I watched so many horror films ... I should be in hell. This movies scares me because of the Reaktion to the innocent child and the demon hiding in the dark corners of his room. It is so schizophrenic and still believable. The babadook is better than any mike Myers, because he acts only in the details, which makes you think he it is only the illusion of the mother. Even when I think about the tv scene I get goosebumps. Why not 9 or8 for this movie? Because the ending is somehow confusing and the son seem to be healed from his weird behaviour just without any reason. It is not scary as get out or not so schizophrenic like the shining."
" Worth The Budget!
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,6,"The Babadook i believe this wasn't my type i could skip it but still needed to watch it after seeing the hype, i didn't really like the villain of the story if it was supernatural it was way better than this thing, (Essie Davis) acting as the mad mom liked her but didn't like the kid (Noah Wiseman) i was disturbed when he was in the scenes, this is a success for a (Australian-Movies) that's made on a budget of (2 million dollars) but unfortunately it was not a commercial success, at last it's ok but not everyones choice as a horror, 6/10潃"
" Better than I thought it was gonna be (:
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,8,"The Babadook really well done creepy movie.
The acting is fantastic and the storyline is very original and executed in a very eerie and chilling way."
" The greatest fear lies in being suspicious
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,9,"If you expect jump-scares or spluttering scenes, change your attitude for this movie. What makes ""The Babadook"" a big surprise is its way to interact with your imagination. It gives you the hint of what Babadook is, but your imagination will not freed you from him. The shape you give of him is what makes this movie one of the creepiest things you will ever see. Must watch for horrors fans"
" Boring and childish...
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,1,"For an Australian movie I'm not surprised that this was slow and dull but overall was definitely boring and not scary..Emotionally I didn't find myself invested to enjoy the story and the thriller/horror element was not on a high level.The film tries to be scary with the Babadook book, I just found it too childish and unoriginal."
" Genuinely scary
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,9,"Must watch. Great character development. Although it is a generic demonic possession movie it feels different. I like to find movies that are actually scary, this is around the top of the list of scariest movies of all time. I actually felt bad for the characters as the demon, compared to other demon movies, was alot more evil and difficult to live with. Must watch."
" Negative
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,3,"I know, I know - I'm not 'smart' enough to understand that quick shot of the sun represented a grilled cheese sandwich... LOL. Whatever.Any symbol, and/or allegory supposedly representing grief, fear, and loneliness within the film must ""work"" to be successful. If 90% of viewers don't see it, or they do not find it entertaining or valuable when they do - then what's the point? I don't need a scarf wearer named Basil to blurt out the word ""metaphor"" as if that automatically morphs a bad movie into a good one. In order for a movie like this to be worthwhile, it must be good both above AND below the surface. Unfortunately, this is neither. Instead it tricks the viewer into watching a movie about something they never intended to see.This movie is exactly what it is and nothing more. Don't let anyone shame you or call your intelligence into question if you found it, like I did, both annoying and silly. Don't argue! Just smile, hand them a clove cigarette, and call it a day."
" Good movie
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,7,I liked this movie quite a bit. Had a real creepy feel to it. The mom and son were great actors. It's rare to find a decent horror movie that you actually enjoy but this one was pretty good from beginning to end. Almost more of a suspense movie. Highly recommend it of your a horror movie fan.
" Horror with emotionional intelligence
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,10,"If you like slasher or cheap thrill horror films of dumb teenagagers running up the stares thinking the masked killer is their boyfriend playing a prank, skip this. It's not an American CGI heavy blockbuster. It's not meant to be a Haunted House, demonic possession cliche.The Babadook dwells on themes of grief, the loneliness of being a single parent and fear of oneself. Jennifer Kent has done a remarkable film to bring this to life. The acting is spot on perfection. I wish there were more horrors with this type of emotional intelligence. One can compare it to the same calibre films done by Ari Aster (Midsommer, Hereditary), as where his films focuses on the impact of grief. The Babadook focuses on the lonely aftermath. True horror of oneself."
" More reasons we need more women to make more movies
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,9,Easily one of the creepiest films ever made. It's so well done I can't wait to see what she does next.
" Scary? LOL!不
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,1,"Comparing this to the Excorcist is laughable and disturbing- since it's not even CLOSE to the Excorcist in ANY way.The Babadook is trash- not scary, not original, not anything- literally one of the worst, not-at-all-scary movies i've ever wasted time on."
" Original and scary!
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this atmospheric suspenseful horror film. The acting was incredible and not only was it scary it was relatable. An undercurrent of what can happen to a person when grief, anger and loss are not dealt with. Anyone looking for easy scares and Hollywood monsters will be disappointed as this is a deep complex story of survival and strength."
" Yabba Dabba Do Not.
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,5,"The Babadook was released back in 2014, and I haven't caught up with it until now. There was a fair amount of positive vibe about it. However I have to say after seeing The Babadook for the first time, I was a little disappointed because I didn't think it was scary. It doesnt compare well to stuff like The (original) Shining, and other iconic horror films of the past that are capable of standing on their own and therefore can never be replicated. Frankly I guess, The Haunting, The Innocents, even The Sixth Sense can never be replaced. Part of the problem seems to be an anxiety of influence on the part of current practioners. They seem unable to create for themselves a style that pays homage, but at the same time makes a new and vibrant contribution to the genre.
I realise that The Babadook is really more a psychological thriller than straight horror. This has to be a fact, because nobody mentions ghosts, or paranormal activity being responsible for the events portrayed, when it seems obvious to the viewer that this is indeed what's going on. We receive a massive build-up, but the story peeters out due to lack of character development, or any explanation for these strange events occurring. The actors subsequently are left to get out there and do a lot of acting to push the story along, when there isnt much of story to begin with.
I also have to admit to an aversion towards films like this who are too coy to actually show the monster for anything longer than a couple of seconds. This may have worked for a horror genius like Val Lewton, but as far as I'm concerned, not many others. Even Jaws to me, was at a disadvantage because it took so long to get a decent glimpse of the shark. But I digress.
Just to mention a few good things, the young boy who plays Essie Davis' son is either adorably vulnerable or obnoxious, but he is wonderfully expressive in a difficult role. The interior of the house has a fascination about it that's very moody and sinister, and makes the claustrophobic nature of the events quietly unsettling. However the back story isn't explained very well nor the reason for finding the book, the reason for the haunting or the magical entrance of the dead husband at the end, which I found more bewildering than what was happening onscreen.
I guess I've been spoilt by the great titles, and directors who created modern horror. No matter what has come after I get into a tizz and can't wait to defend them against the New guard. But as you get older it's more difficult to rationalise your disappointments in life so I will give this a score based on the idea that at least they made an attempt."
" Metaphor heavy
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,9,"This is a movie where the ratings have a high mean but a large variance. If you go in expecting a jumpscare-fiesta you will be dissapointed.The Babadook doesen't really rely on jumpscares and scary monsters the same way other horror movies do, dont go in expecting a quick adrenaline rush. But if you rather let yourself invest in the story you will get an

" I would give 6.5 but there is no option though

" Above Average Horror Movie
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,7,"The Babadook is a 2014 Australian horror movie about a single mother and his son who starts having illusions about a monster Mister Babadook, which is released from a cursed Book. Considering it's low budget it is pretty good in terms of scares and definitely much better than other cringy moden horror movies.So, actually Amelia lost her husband in a car accident while the delivery of his son, Samuel. That's why she regrets that day and had never celebrated her son's b'day because her dad died the same day. This results in the tensions and bad relationship b/w Amelia and her son. Here Babadook is the metaphor for Amelia's suffering and grief. Because of this grief, she didn't take care of her son properly. This grief increased so much that she became possessed by her own tensions and turned crazy. At last, she accepted her fate and overcame her emotions. And she finally moved on. Due to this, Babadook became weak and became their pet.Overall, due to the acting and cinematography, it manages to scare us, but not as much as the critics say"
" Low budget, simplistic plot, ""nothing really happens"" movie.
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,1,Just another low budget movie with obvious plot. It is pretty clear what the issue is (or more like no issue at all) in the first 15 minutes of the movie. The rest is just a filler of try hard suspense scenes.

" Horrific
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,7,This movie gave me nightmares. I wanted to score lower only because it gave me creeps. But I just cant do it. Babadook is a somekind of masterpiece
" Not Your Cheap Jump Scare Thriller
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,8,"This is a representation of how a psychological horror movie is supposed to be. A product of German Expressionism with some Surrealist tones, this is a true visual experience with a unique stylistic approach.A troubled mother struggling with grief finds herself at the mercy of her own fear and the fear of her son. This is a truly terrifying thought, that we as humans are able to plague our own lives causing our own destruction. Thus this movie is far beyond the simple minded fear of death, it is about the fear of living and I think this is a way for the filmmaker to tackle a very real problem today and that is of depression.I found myself thinking about this movie for several days after watching it the first time until I finally sat down and watched it again, and despite some underexposed shots I still think that this film deserves an 8/10."
" Don't watch unless you WANT to b scared!
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,9,"Let me explain how scary this is: I've seen this movie in its entirety before. Been a couple years since I've seen it. Was looking for a good scary movie, disappointed with current finds. I started watching this one again, and had to turn it off halfway through. Nope; don't need to be that scared r/n thanks."
" What the heck?
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,4,"Let me start off by saying that while this film is watchable, the audio is downright horrendous and sinful with how bad it is. The times you need to listen, the audio is so low that the actors and actresses may as well be whispering, and when you don't need to listen it's deafening at how unnecessarily loud it is. Did they use a hollowed out pumpkin, because they couldn't afford a boom?The ending makes no sense whatsoever and the fact that they built up the story so that it could have been so good at the end, only to ruin it with that HORRENDOUS ending makes it sp frustrating because it could have been so good.I realy don't understand how this movie has so many good reviews. It's not that great and really not worth your time other than to say that you saw it, and honestly you don't need to."
" Can We Forget About This Film Already..?
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,1,"Don't think me unpatriotic or unsupportive, being Australian, but I consider this way overrated piece of drivel to be one of this country's poorest films.I wish I'd made it though myself, for purely financial concerns but then I probably would have spent the rest of my life playing it down for artistic integrity. On an international level, it's like the general populace had been warned that they would all rot in Hell if they ever dared to dislike this film.Almost 'everyone' loves this miserable tale of a dreary modern day harridan going to pieces and taking it out on her poor defenseless child - (drumroll...enter the Babadook). It's like someone hitting you on the back of the head going ""Isn't this priceless""?- ""So freaky and scary"". Get over it.If you want to see a true Australian masterwork of startling effect, then try Walkabout, Wake In Fright or Between Wars and bury this overpraised piece of piffle once and for all."
" Among the best horror movies ever made.
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,9,"Jennifer Kent's directorial debut could not have been better, ""The Babadook"" is one of the most original horror movies out there that dares walk its own path in one of the most overly crowded genres in the industry. In this film, single-mother Amelia (Davis) struggles to give her eccentric son Samuel (Wiseman) and a stable childhood following the death of his father (Winspear). As they find a children's book with not a very happy ending, they are haunted by the horrifying - but well dressed - entity, the Babadook. The film is without doubt, in my opinion, some of the scariest horror movies released in this decade, as the mother decent into madness following the arrival of the Babadook, an increasing feeling of isolation crawls upon you which inflicts much more scares than the menace himself, who is sparsely seen, making him more fearful when he finally appears. Throughout ""The Babadook"", the atmosphere and grayish filter adds to the overlaying cloud of unease surrounding the entire story. To me, Kent has created a horror film close to perfection which challenges the innovativeness of the horror industry. More should dare to take leaps into the unexpected since that often brings many more scares than your usually jump scares or overused ghosts. The hype over this film is understandable, and deservingly so, not many movies has had me scared like this. And also, in contrast to an absolute majority of scary movies out there, the film's themes and characters can be analyzed and discussed after. Is the Babadook real or just a reflection of a mother's depression and its subsequent effects on a small child. The more humorous analysis of the title character being a sad, depressed gay man is maybe less to study but nevertheless shows the impact on popular culture this astonishing horror movie has had."
" A meditation on grief
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,9,"The Babadook surprised me on two counts.First, as someone who doesn't often get the warm fuzzies at spooky films, this did. It's a well acted, believable account of a mum and child being haunted by a seemingly malevolent 'thing'. Effective jumps and creeping tension are handled well.But I was surprised again by the end, as I came away seeing it as an allegory for deep grief and a way through it. I found it quite moving, the mum finding a place for that darkness, finally taking control of it."
" Pros and cons
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,7,"Pros:
Good horror, channeled spooky stuff like dark bedrooms, scary faces and bugs in a really cool way, nostalgic almost
Good acting, the mom was relatable and it was fun to follow her struggle
The kids antics were usually entertaining
Atmospheric lightingCons:
No real interesting characters besides our two heroes
No concrete rules attached to the creature
Th dead husband was done so poorly, could not empathize with her missing him at allBest part: the mom going off, cutting the phone line and just letting stuff out at the kid, kind of weight of her shoulders
Worst part: turning the monster into a coat near the end, I don't know if that cliche will ever work at all"
" Beat your kids!!!
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,1,"This movie is both boring and annoying. It revolves around a grieving mother who never disciplines her son so he grows into an obnoxious little twat. He screams, he always gets his way, and he brings weapons to school. Yes legit weapons. He is only six yet he is violent to the point he breaks his cousins nose in two places. And the mother sees nothing wrong with this??? This is disgusting. People say this movie has tons of symbolism but the only symbolism I see is that if you don't discipline your kids they grow up into serial killers or mass shooters. An hour and a half of cheap scares and effects mixed with a whining, psychopath six year old who you wish got put down faster than a one legged horse. The only real scare here is that there are parents like this who let their kids grow up into real murdering monsters."
" Brilliant depiction of a borderline mother and her child
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,10,"Like the child -- and adults -- in the film, the audience is blind to the simple, shattering reality: Amelia created the Babadook. Amelia is -- and always was -- the Babadook. The film brilliantly depicts the dissociated perceptions of both child and mother as they attempt to survive their horrifying and tragic reality. Because, who can fathom a mother who is pathologically detached, hateful, malicious, and... violent towards her child? Not the child, not the mother, and not even the adults that surround them. The adults who watch this film. We are blinded by our deeply held belief that mothers are supposed to be nurturing, loving, and most of all... safe havens for their children. The reality is that Amelia is possessed -- by borderline personality disorder triggered by the traumatic loss of her husband. A perpetual victim, she feeds off of her self-pity and the pity of those around her, using it to justify her seething resentment of her child. Unable to take responsibility for her abusive behavior, she birthed the ""Babadook"". Underneath it all is a deeply troubled mother -- and a brave child living in constant fear of and for his mother, desperately struggling to protect himself, protect his (abusive) mother, and, ultimately, to survive. I am so grateful for this film, which so perfectly encapsulates the reality of hidden mental illness, giving life to the complex experiences of mother, child, and outside observers."

" Screaming child + beyond stupid ending = disappointment
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,5,"No spoilers here, I do think it is worth a watch, but the constantly screaming child (not because he's being tortured or anything 'horror' related, just ""because"" they decided to make him scream for a good chunk of the movie) and the *terrible* ending ruin what would have otherwise, easily, been an 8 or 9/10 movie."
" Wow, That Was Terrible
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,1,"I say this a lot, but the writing was bad and so was the acting. The only thing that kept us watching the movie was the fact that we desperately wanted to see the bratty child die. Spoiler alert, we were disappointed. We were well into the movie before the Babadook even showed up. The movie had no likeable main characters, and they killed off the best actor, the dog. Do not recommend."
" Taps into our most personal fears... and isn't that what good horror should do?
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,7,"I'm not a parent, but I can imagine that this would hit me even harder if I were. This is one film that fully deserves the acclaim it received. Like all great horror, it touches us where it hurts the most deeply. Yes, it is an independent film and that shows in spots, but the emotional impact makes up for that."
" Amazing Horror Film.
",2019-09-18 00:00:00,10,"Review:
'The Babadook' is an Australian psychological-horror film written and directed by Jennifer Kent. It is based on the 2005 short film 'Monster', also written and directed by Kent. This movie re-invests the horror genre! Not only is this movie a creepy monster movie, but it's also about grievance and depression when you look into it deeper. The way it's portrayed in this movie, by the end you're left wondering whether the Babadook was even real or just a manifestation created by the resentment Amelia had for her son over the years.
The film follows Amelia (Essie Davis) and her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). Samuel is an outspoken boy, who does what he wants without thinking of consequences. As Samuel's behavior worsens, they two become more isolated from family and friends, and things get strange in their home, when what appears to be a children's story book titled Mr. Babadook shows up. When Amelia reads the book to Samuel as a bedtime story, she quickly realizes it's not an innocent children book at all.
The acting in this movie is breathtaking and real. It stars Essie Davis as Amelia, a widowed mother still in despair over the death of her husband on the day her son was born. Her son, - played by Noah Wiseman - is a difficult six-year old boy named Samuel. He is very outspoken, prone to violent outbursts and likes to train to hunt monsters only he can see with homemade weapons.
I love the fact that Jennifer Kent knows that a great horror movie doesn't need to rely on cheap jump scares. To me, unique twists and bold choices will always be better than the cookie cutter horror clich矇s we have nowadays. This movie is truly terrifying and raw to its core, as well as being highly entertaining.
Overall, this movie is an excellent genre-defying horror movie, and I highly recommend it to any horror fan! 'The Babadook' gets my stamp of approval!
5/5"
" Is this the same film?
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,3,"Huge ratings for this film, but I'm so confident I watched the B-movie version?

Some clues about it too, what and why was it? How to beat it? She literally screamed at it to get out of her house... And then why the hell did she keep it in the basement and feed it worms?Confused and dissatisfied."

",2019-08-24 00:00:00,9,"This is a character study and although you'll need to watch it ~3 times to 'get it', it's better than an exorcist type film and just as scary because it's taking place in any city in the world"
" Just terrible

and .........
this movie didnt scared me as i expected ,  if i wanna prevent a marriage or a couple who wanna have a child im gonna show this movie to them .
ITS MORE DRAMA THAN HORROR"
" Masterpiece!
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,9,"The Babadook, one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, legitimately captures the feelings of terror and evil and remind us of what monsters lay dormant in us all, this is not a comfortable or fun movie but a genuine, gripping and gritty masterpiece which will immerse you.Charactor portrayals and arcs were excellently acted by the cast. If your a fan of the genre it's an absolute must watch"
" Must watch

" I apologized to my friends for putting this film on
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,1,"Based on internet reviews I've read it's a good horror movie. It wasn't I wasted everyones time by putting it on, including my own. It's boring, it's not scary, it has nothing going on. Everyone included thought so, my friend's younger brother that was 16 was bored to death. Just terrible, one of the worst horror movies I've watched. Taking my time to write this review so you will not waste everyone's time like I did... Watch ""heredetiary"" or ""get out"" if you didn't you will have much better time."
" Tense Aussie thriller
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,7,"Tension is fun isn't it. Right from the outside this has it in spades. Sparse swathes of near silence punctuated with loud noises, innocent at first, but constantly building. Our two main characters are damaged, the mother wears it on the outside, the child more internal, but between them the issues slide deeper and darker. A family failing to recover from tragic loss of a husband and father. The simple car crash device could seem hackneyed and their house, minimal grey and drab, well, what I'm saying is the tropes are all there. The spooky kid, a conduit for the unseen terror that lurks and the consuming madness it brings. What's real, what's fiction, as the mother's sanity unravels. It's fun to get mixed up in the fantasy, but there's something much more interesting in looking at what's driving this, the mother's depression, delusion, anxiety, sleep deprivation, parental inability, it's all fuel for a sometimes formulaic thriller, but one that still works really well. I'm never keen on the supernatural, but when it has some anchor in reality I'm on board and this walks the tightrope just right. It helps that both Essie Davies and Noah Wiseman work so well, especially as the screen is largely theirs and theirs alone and it's nice to see a film that knows how to play to its strengths. Ba ba dook dook DOOK!"

" A beautifully sad movie
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,9,"I found it rather hard to categorize or describe this movie. It's the haunting story of very sad woman and her child where the line between supernatural and psychological was blurred for me. And this even more so after watching it again.
All I know is that while it's truly hard for what can be considered a horror movie to also be heartbreakingly touching, this movie achieved just that.
It is one of my favourite movies and would recommend at least 2 viewings to fully capture its beauty."
" Great movie super scary
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,8,"Like it or not, you can not deny that this is one of the most excessively terrifying films ever made. The Babadook gets under your skin and stays there. While I recently watched this, I had to pause the movie and take a breather."
" Get out !
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,5,"The only Strength of 'The Babadook' is great acting. Watch it for Essie Davis as she is in good form. The rest of the film which relies on horror, or as i would say to fear us is not right up there. It's horror comes from basic things such as a horror book named Babadook,Strange voices and the household atmosphere, to the most part to begin with it succeeds but then it becomes repetitive when things are just folding to make us fear not really fear us. This is horror at its most basic level, as i said earlier its only savage is Essie Davis rest of the film is average. The only good thing i will say about it is It's not awful.
5/10"
" Psychosis or Reality, scary nevertheless!
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,8,"It's astounding, how well developed the movie's horror is. It starts with the childish imaginary terrors that the son of the protagonist suffers from at night. Whenever the son cannot sleep, the mother (the main character) soothes him and reads to him until he's back in the realm of dreams.
One evening, the son had a nightmare again and the mother let him choose the book, which she reads to him; it's called 'Mister Babadook'. At first, it looks like a beautifully drawn childrens book, but it quickly turns out to be anything but that. The son is genuinely terrified by it and even the mother is apprehensive.
A couple days later, the mother destroys and throws the book in the trash bin, but finds it, just the next day, lying in front of her home's door - the pages that she destroyed glued together. And from here on, the real terror starts.
The son claims again and again that he had encounters with the babadook in his bedroom and the mother hears strange noises and has visions of the clawed monster as well. The babadook grows in power until he is nearly omnipresent. After a heavy, terrifying fight against the babadook, which is the climax of movie, the mother and the son manage to lock the powerful monster in the home's basement, which makes it his life prison.What also is really well done, is the fact that it's - for the most part of the film - not easy to say, if the events are just psychotic experiences of the mother and her son or if it's really happening. It's interesting to be left constantly doubting the films reality."

" An Amazing New Horror Classic
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the best horror movie I have ever seen. It keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire runtime. But what I liked about this movie the most was its interpretation of grief. Not everyone who sees this film will pick up on it many will see it as a straight up monster movie and will be disappointed because of the slow pace and lack of a ""big monster reveal"" but if you look a bit deeper into the hidden meanings I think you will really love it."
" The psychological horror of sadness.
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Babadook is a special film that takes seriousness with great complexity and stylism, presenting a spooky story through psychological terror (the ability to frighten us with our imagination rather than with the presentation of the monster, villain or enemy) and it does not fail in the unparalleled narrative quality and the sad, decaying and lost atmosphere it holds. I understand the critical reception of the film, after all it is a different shot in an oversaturated genre.The Babadook is a psychological horror movie, full of unexplained mystery and scenes designed to keep us tense and stressed by the possibility of something. The suspense is real and remains constant throughout the film, being the main premise of this the ability we have to imagine things that are not there, in turn, it presents a story based on the pain of the loss of a loved one, combining the difficulties of fear of the unknown with the horror of eternal goodbye.With excellent performances and an atmosphere built to give us a feeling of maximum discomfort, The Babadook manages to penetrate strongly between our nerves, especially if we investigate its surface and go deep into its depth. A good horror movie that plays with our minds and depicts us a story through a different and well narrated structure."
" Funny!
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,3,It started creepy but turned boring eventually.Did anyone really get scared?!Why are the critics overrating such stupid movies.The most worst acting I've ever seen from Essie davis.This movie fails at every point.Just a waste of time
" Haunting Tale of Grief and the Descent into Madness
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,9,"This film was one of the first that I checked out when I got into listening to podcasts. I started to make a list of the films I had missed as for the longest time; I was bad about seeing new horror films. Updating this review is really giving me fond memories because of this actually. The synopsis is a widowed mother, plagued by the violent death of her husband, battles with her son's fear of a monster lurking in the house, but soon discovers a sinister presence all around her.We start by filling in the back-story through a nightmare. Amelia (Essie Davis) was in a car accident with her husband, Oskar (Benjamin Winspear) while she was pregnant. The husband was killed and Samuel (Noah Wiseman) was born that day. He wakes up her from this nightmare telling her that he had one of his own. She goes into his room to check for a monster, reads him a story and Samuel ends up sleeping in bed with her. We see that keeps her from getting sleep herself.Amelia works a nurse in a retirement home. She is struggling with being tired. One of her co-workers is Robbie (Daniel Henshall) and he shows interest in her. Amelia is informed that her son's school is calling her. Samuel makes weapons and is into magic. He brought a make-shift gun that shoots darts to school. They want to separate the boy, who already feels alienated. Amelia won't have this and pulls him out of school.That night, she allows him to pick out the book she will read him to go to bed. The one he chooses is one she hasn't seen before called The Bababook. It is a pop-up book with pull slides in it. The book though is quite scary and it ends up upsetting Samuel, which becomes another sleepless night for Amelia.Amelia's sister is played by Claire (Hayley McElhinney). The two of them go to a park with their kids and we start to get that Claire and her daughter don't really care for Samuel. He is quite needy, loud and unruly. Claire does allow the boy to come over during the day since he isn't in school. Amelia tells him not to speak of the Bababook and that he isn't real.Amelia goes to work and is having a rough day. She is caught being rude to the residents by another nurse. Robbie tells her that he will cover for her to go home. She decides to go and have a relaxing day to herself. When she checks her phone though, she has ten missed calls from her sister. Amelia goes to her house to find her son by himself in the yard. He was talking to something and it freaked Claire out.She continually tries to convince Samuel that the Bababook is not real and that it is something in his head. He has a seizure while they are driving home and he is taken to the doctor. Amelia begs the doctor to give her something for him to sleep. He is reluctant, but does write her a script.She starts to see things herself though. The book she had hid on top of her bureau and somehow Samuel got it back. She then threw it away, ripping all the pages out of it. There is knocking at the door and she finds the book on her doorstep. The pages are taped back together and there is more to the story this time. There are images of the mother killing their dog, son and herself. She starts to see images of the creature from the book on television as well as thinking she sees it in person.Now I really wanted to see this film when it first came out and missed the chance. As I said earlier, I heard from horror podcasts that I listen to as well that this film was good, so I was intrigued. I do agree with them, this is really good. The story of this was interesting to me. I like the idea of this book that is about the creature, but it doesn't give really much background. It is creepier seeing the images and it being geared toward children. I love that Amelia doesn't think it is real, but she isn't sleeping. She slowly descends into madness and it makes you start to wonder, is the creature real or has she lost it. The concept of the Bababook getting inside of her helps to make it ambiguous as well.There is much deeper themes here as well that I really took to heart after a second viewing. Amelia is told by Claire that she wants to talk more to her sister, even though it really doesn't feel that way. Amelia has closed herself off when Oskar passed away. She never truly dealt with that grief, which is why she won't celebrate Samuel's birthday on the actual day since it's the anniversary of the death as well. The lack of sleep and exhaustion add to the building frustration and change we see in her character. It is also overwhelming to deal with what she has and raise the child that you share with the person you lost.To the pacing of the film, I think it is well done. We get the establishment that Amelia is struggling from the beginning. I like the transition that we see her lying in bed and then it will get bright fast, signifying that she isn't sleeping and it doesn't feel like restful sleep. The longer this goes, the more we see the aspects above growing within her. When she starts seeing the images of The Babadook, it really made me feel uneasy as well. After this second viewing, I really liked the ending and the implications of what has transpired.I will say that for the acting, it was good. Davis does a great job. I feel horrible for her and know that when you aren't sleeping how irritable and how hard it would be to function. The longer it goes on, the worse she got and it is quite believable. Wiseman was extremely annoying and got on my nerves. I almost wanted his character to get murdered by how bad he was, but his acting was good to get that reaction out of me. He was supposed to play the character this way and he did an excellent job of it. The rest of the cast do round out the film for what was needed as well.Next I want to talk about the creature in this film. I think he looks great. We don't get to see him a lot, it is only glimpses and I love that. It makes it that much scarier. I did find it interesting as well that he was modeled after Lon Chaney from London After Midnight. There aren't a lot of effects really in the film, but the ones that are done look good so I have no issues there. The editing of this film is really good as well. They incorporated a lot of cartoons and edited the creature into things on television. Some of these were really creepy to me and I liked it. The film was also shot very well in my opinion.The score didn't stand out to me overall, but there were some scenes that it did and it really helped the mood of the scene. I do have to commend the film; the use of the creature saying its name was quite creepy. They also seemed to incorporate bug sounds as well as a monster's howl that I think ties back in with things that are seen earlier. This did help to enhance the film.Now with that said, I would recommend this film. The story and concept of the film are great and quite socially relevant. The acting is very good. The editing of the film was well done. The creature looked really good and the score doesn't always stand out, but when it does, it makes the scenes that much creepier. There will be some people who don't care for this, especially with the implications at the end. You still should give it a watch, even if you aren't a fan of the genre. I would say that this is a very good film overall and definitely worth a viewing."
" Depressing , unsettling
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,8,"This movie is great and it is one of the best psychological Horror movie . this movie is not for them who are expecting the jumpscares and all the stuffs like that. but it is for them who is big fan of horror genre and has good sense of it. The acting in particular is very strong by both mother and her son . The movie is depressing and it represents the loneliness and how can it give place to a monster and atlast i would say ""It's in your book or it's in your look you can't get rid of babadook""Its Worth ur time"
" Interesting psychological movie !

It's depressing, horrifying, and ORIGINALI mean how can you not like this new take on a movie, it's well executed, with sold direction, a solid script, AN A AMAZING LEAD ACTRESS WHO JUST PUTS THE CHERRY ON TOP FOR ME."
" Waste of my valuable time
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,1,Watched this based on some reviews on IMDB and I regret of watching such crap. It contain neither a new story nor any scary goofy scenes.

",2019-05-09 00:00:00,1,"I was very hyped about seeing this movie, especially because it has a great rating here, which is pretty high for a horror movie. But then i started watching it and i cant believe HOW THE HELL did it get such a good rate ??? The movie itself was very poorly shot, and dont even get me started on that little kid, for whom i was praying the entire movie that the bad guy gets him. It was really the worst movie of all time and i dont get how people can put 10/10 rate here, are you blind ???"
" Worst Horror, A stain on the category of Horror
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,1,Was a real sh***t. Even the jimmy falon show could be more horror than this.
" A slow burner that pays off
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,8,"This is one scary movie. This is more a drama than a horror movie in my opinion but believe me, the horror scenes are plenty scary. I haven't seen this movie in years and I still remember vividly when the babadook entered the boys room at night. If that scene didn't scare you then I'm not sure what will. Highly recommend for those wanting a strong drama with some good frights along the way!"
" Misleading ""Horror"" Movie
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,1,"I must have watching a different version of this movie compared to the other reviews that praise this to be a top horror movie in its class. To say it was the best or the greatest is very misleading. What this movie does is it drive you to the edge of your seat with annoyance and frustration with the main characters in this movie. Anyone grown adult can tell you in an instant what is wrong with the plot of this movie! Sheer lack of responsibility as a parent. The mothers absolute inability to function with daily remedial task let alone discipline her child will send you away screaming and fuming. Whats worse is that this went on for a good part of the movie. It wasn't until the 3rd act when the kid starts to become a little less annoying. Never the less, if you're expecting a good entertaining horror movie, look else where. If you want a lesson in life on how to NOT to be a parent and or a responsible adult, watch this movie."
" Decent execution of a weak script
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,4,"The Babadook (dook dook...) is an exploration of the long-term effects of grief and loss and how, if they aren't dealt with properly, those feelings can consume you.The film has a general feeling of hopelessness and gloom, along with an eerie and off-putting sense of dreamlike surrealism achieved through some really cool editing and film-making choices. The presentation and general tone of this film is where it really shines, the whole film feels like a descent into madness as we see the characters of the film become more distressed, sleep deprived and down-right insane as the film progresses.Where the film falls down is in its horror and its script. God in heaven is the Babadook itself goofy. To steal a line from Adam from YMS ""A hipster in a top hat"" standing in the corner isn't frightening, it's hilarious. Not to mention the unbelievably long list of terrible horror movie cliches this movie falls into which just manage to make the story of the film more bland and predictable. Special mention goes to the son who manages to fulfill every ""Kid in a horror movie"" cliche like he's ticking off a checklist.All in all, The Babadook is an unsettling and relatively interesting exploration of grief and paranoia which is held down by a predictable plot and comedic, cliche horror."
" Weird and cofusing not sure 
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,7,"It was just weird the ending just didn't make sense i will need to google this and that it, was ok ddo not on top horrors but gave me the creeps"
" Great build up with a lousy endning
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,6,"This movie had a lot of suspense and creepyness to it, unfortunately it didn't manage to end the movie very well.Don't quite get all the 1-star reviews."
" Not for the weak stomached
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,9,"I don't usually get scared in ""scary"" movies, but this one actually scared me.
The Babadook represents amplified emotions a single mother has raising a child that is different than most kids. For example, when people say ""I'm going to kill you."" They don't actually mean it, but The Babadook is the literal meaning of that. This movie is horrifying and not for the weak stomached. Nevertheless, I LOVED ""The Babadook"", I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing. The Babadook itself is a very creepy villain. I recommend this movie to people who can handle death, abuse, and frightening scenes."
" Not as smart as it thinks it is but I'll take it over a lot of other supposedly superior ""horror"".
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,6,"The first scene was laughable but from the second I got the immediate impression I was watching a superior horror movie.The conflict between a bereaved mother and her problem child is enough to make dark, unsettling viewing even without the horror elements.But I take issue with these horror movie antagonists who feels the need to just mess with their hosts for 60 minutes before just killing or possessing them or whatever it is they want.A lot of people have stated ""metaphor for depression"" and I really don't want to give it that much credit. I liked the beautiful art within art in the form of that excellent book that just keeps coming back.But although rather chilling and engaging with two horrifically convincing performances as mother and son not seeing eye to eye there is so much wrong with this. Despite the relative freshness of the story (I know it's an incorporeal terror in a house that terrorized people apparently for fun but trust me it's fresher than a lot of other movies with the same premise) there are so many wrong notes.In one seen the phone rings and all we hear on the other end is a strained voice saying ""Babadooooook...Babadoooooook"". This immediately makes the thing something corporeal and kills the mood almost irreparably. Various other shooting tricks that should have been left in the '20s also make the picture more funny than scary. And what is up with them showing movies within the movie?This is a movie with some good talent behind it sadly collapsed under its own smugness and complacency. But you could do so much worse."
" Great psychological thriller
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,8,"""Ba-Ba-Ba Dook-Dook-Dook, that's when you'll know he's around."" (The Babadook 2014) Suspense, jump scares, agony, and mystery are all present in Jennifer Kent's, The Babadook (2014). The Babadook is a great superior thriller that does an outstanding job of capturing the viewer's attention and keeping them on edge with mystery and suspense, the majority of the film. This isn't your typical thriller where man or beast as the antagonist. The Babadook hits you at a psychological level with the antagonist being a supernatural being that you must fear before he shows himself to you. Kent does an amazing job creating a creepy sense of discomfort from start to end and develops the characters enough so that we actually care about them.With all the given evidence, I believe that Mister Babadook is just a figment of the imagination. A monster of the mind that stems from severe depression, repressed guilt and sheer exhaustion. Is Babadook really the monster or is the monster man's mind? Mister Babadook first appears in a red-bound children's book titled ""Mister Babadook"" read by the mother Amelia to her son Samuel. The audience also never sees Mister Babadook on screen. Babadook only torments the people that let him into the house and recognize his existence through fear. At first, only Samuel can see Mister Babadook but as Amelia becomes more depressed and exhausted, she also sees him. Amelia than tries to get rid of the book, but the book always returns. ""YOU CANNOT GET RID OF MEEE!"" (The Babadook 2014)."
" A Brief Look at The Babadook
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,7,"The lights flicker, bugs begin to crawl, shadows envelop the scene, the Babadook has arrived. Jennifer Kent's The Babadook (2014) is not your quotidian psychological thriller. Beneath the superficial paranormal threat, Kent artfully implements multiple double entendres to be unearthed by the viewer. While doing so, Kent tenaciously utilizes extreme but simple cinematographic elements to induce fear in her audience. Analogous to Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), this film frequently employs earsplitting sounds, disquieting dissonance and a woman's bloodcurdling screams to keep the viewer on edge.
Before being exposed to the Babadook, Kent constructs the platform for her narrative by using precise cinematography to delineate the hardships and emotions of the protagonist, Amelia (Essie Davis). From this structure, the audience is informed of the contemporary grief, stress and frustrations constantly surrounding her. Through such relatable downbeat emotions, Kent presents a character worthy of our sympathy. Moving forward, The Babadook departs from traditional transcendent psychological thrillers by translating Amelia's sentiments into the supernatural-being known as the Babadook. In other words, Amelia's underlying emotions are organized into one paranormal being, thus granting greater significance than the trite demonic antagonist capriciously haunting the principal characters of a film as seen in Oren Peli's Paranormal Activity (2007). Moreover, the initial presentation of Mister Babadook is arguably one of the greatest conventions the film has to offer. As Amelia sits down to read the seemingly innocent children's book, Kent employs an amalgam of close-up pans and cuts along with a shrill insect-like buzzing to hyperbolize the disturbing contents of the wicked red book, ""Mister Babadook"". Thus, leaving the viewer rid with anticipation and fear of the imminent occult threat.
Jennifer Kent's ability to sophistically develop the film to the latter electrifying zenith is subjectively unparalleled. The slow introduction to the tall, rigid figure dressed in a jet-black trench coat and top hat is both enticing and suspenseful, continuously leaving the audience hungry for more. By creating an indirect relationship between Amelia and the demonic aggressor, the viewer is immersed in a complex allegorical narrative rather than a rudimentary hedonistic thriller. Furthermore, the negative emotions that construct the relationship are emotions that many individuals have grappled with in life, resulting in an elaborate alignment between the viewer and the subliminal essence of the film. In retrospect, Jennifer Kent's The Babadook does not disappoint as it proves to be a captivating psychological thriller rich with concealed narratives awaiting subsequent analysis."
" Great Allegory!!!
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,10,"***SPOILER ALERT***
The Babadook, directed and written by Jennifer Kent, creatively uses the primitive foundation set by previous horror films that showcase our beloved monsters, such as Frankenstein and the Wolfman. As we learn more about main character Amelia, her son and the struggles they have overcome the last seven years with the loss of husband and father, we see that Kent gives this imaginative figure that haunts and lingers over their shoulders, the Babadook, a different face- mental illness. This film is very similar to Inside, directed by Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury, where again, a single mother finds herself depressed after the loss of her husband, and has to literally fight for her life against the monstrous feminine which was analogous of the inner demons of depression.
Amelia's character artfully evolves throughout the film, focusing on each stage of depression from denial to acceptance. She first denies the Babadook/ depression, but after she faces anger and bargaining, she soon accepts the Babadook/ depression, and is able to live with him in a coexisting matter. Using various angles, low key lighting and playing with darks and lights, Kent truly demonstrates the lingering depression and paranoia that mother, Amelia, has. As we see the Babadook doesn't only come at night, but haunts us all day, just as mental illness does. However, most of this film is shot at night, where Amelia and her son are home and most vulnerable in their everyday life. We often see Amelia watching television, with a close up of her face that is highly lit from the screen but swallowed by the darkness around her. Kent also uses camera angles that portray Amelia as cornered or trapped by the Babadook/ mental illness, by providing shots of her from above in bed alone, where again she is highly vulnerable.
This film also plays with sound by using everyday noises such as the opening and closing of doors, clashing of pots and pans and son on. Kent purposefully took these sounds and made them louder, almost giving a chaotic feel that we cannot escape. She also uses sounds of grasshoppers and other insects to provide an underlying theme of infestation- both of the house by literal roaches, but also of the mind by mental illness of depression and paranoia.
Overall, I highly recommend this film as it is highly creative and smart in demonstrating the battle of depression. Kent's The Babadook sets itself aside from other films, in that the main character overcomes depression- unlike other horror films that use depression as the monster such as, Inside by Bustillo and Maury, and Lights Out by David F. Sandberg where mother's with depression die. Kent gives us hope that we can live and coexist with our monstrous inner demons, giving a resolution and restoration to our problems."
" Watch out for the Babadook
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,10,"***SPOILER ALERT***
The Babadook is a very highly praised film by many critics and movie lovers alike. This film has many surprising and unpredictable aspects to it. One of the most loved aspects of this film is the monster that is the Babadook. He represents your inner most fears as well as the truth hiding inside of us all. This film uses many techniques to help instill terror in its viewers as well as to show the real us. In this film, while reading the Babadook book, the mother Amelia, sees her ""inner most desires"" which are murdering her family. The Babadook pulls out our inner darkest desires which are more than irrational. The film paints Amelia as almost going insane worrying about the Babadook coming to visit her, and see starts seeing him everywhere, watching her every move. The Babadook also visits Amelia's son Samuel. He sees the monster before his mother ever does and she thinks that he is just making up crazy little kid stories. By the end of the film, we have seen the Babadook and seen how it takes over your life to fulfill your inner most desires. We also get to see the true terror of what the Babadook actually is. He is like a mix of a demon and a person all in one. He knows how to get in your mind and never leave. The Babadook is an allegory painted for us about our deepest darkest inner desires. He shows us what our souls truly want and in the most terrifying way possible. It is terrifying because it is what we actually want to be true and we realize how horrible we actually are. This film is a critically acclaimed horror film because it is so amazingly directed and portrayed to the viewers. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone. Just don't forget to sleep with he lights on so the Babadook doesn't visit your mind tonight!"
" Psychological Horror at its finest.
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,9,"*SPOILER ALERT*Jennifer Kent's ""The Babadook"" (2014) is a brilliant psychological thriller reinvents the stereotypical paranormal monster film that keeps forming questions within the viewer while keeping them on the edge of their seat. Widowed mother, Amelia and her son Samuel stumble across a red children's book that introduces a monster called the Babadook. Lights begin to flicker, cockroaches crawl out from behind the fridge, and knocking on the dresser echoes through the house and the audience feels the presence of the Babadook. The ominous gargling voice of the monster ruffles into the phone as Amelia picks it up in the middle of the night and suddenly, she knows that Samuel is not one to cry wolf. The creativity of this film really stands out when we finally see the Babadook in his most powerful form. The psychological flare of different moods and levels of irritability and aggressiveness that both of the characters experience when the Babadook is attacking, are so personal as they thrive off what people fear. Similar to the ""The Exorcist""(1973) by William Friedkin, homage is paid through the scenes where the bed shakes and Samuel begins to find himself in trouble at school. The film does an excellent job of being unpredictable and not fully showing the monster throughout the film to keep you on edge. It is worth noting that it is not easy to get rid of this thing either. Amelia is introduced to an unprecedented level of fear when she discovers the mended children's book back on her front step as it relays a terrifying illustration of her killing Samuel and the dog. This is one of the many horrifying elements that keeps the viewer up all night just as it does for both Samuel and Amelia; as the Babadook is always lingering within the shadows."
" A Gripping Nail-Biter
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,9,"The movie The Babadook by Jennifer Kent is a film the forces the audience to use their minds to puzzle out the details of the film. The line between reality and dreams becomes blurred as Amelia's mind meshes the two together. The blue-cast and darker colors lent the film a dreamlike quality that made it difficult to distinguish between reality and Amelia's nightmares. The long shadows and dissonant music accompaniment make the viewers second guess whether Amelia was dreaming or awake. As the colors become more washed out and pale, the whispers at the edge of the discordant sounds became louder, jarring the audience and sending them to the edge of their seats. High shots combined with high key lighting left the audience feeling powerless and that there were secrets Kent was keeping from them. As the movie continues, sleep and awake further blend together as Amelia's dead husband demands that she bring Samuel to her. The movie cuts to Samuel as he watches his mother succumb to Babadook. The shadows lengthen and everything becomes darker as the monster firmly entrenches itself in Amelia's mind. As she desperately tries to regain control of herself, darkness engulfs her bedroom while she demands Babadook leave. Whining, high pitched sounds continue, the music reaches a high as Babadook is forced into a basement. It abruptly ends as Amelia and Samuel can finally rest easily. Throughout the entire movie, the director urges the audience to attempt to determine whether the events were rooted in Amelia's exhausted mind or reality. She weaves nightmarish villains slowly into the threads of reality until the viewers second guess themselves as Babadook appears whenever Amelia turns around. The dark shadows Amelia continuously lurks in only emphasizes how vulnerable she is to the nightmare her innocent son tries to warn her about. Just when the shadows seem darkest, Kent offers closure in the guise of a trapped Babadook and a shadow-free house that Amelia and Samuel now live in."
" This is rare for me!
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,3,I saw this once a few years ago & was annoyed with so much of it especially the kid! I can't figure why so many like this movie. I guess it's a little scary but in my opinion it's one of the worst films I've ever watched -- that's all I wanna say.
" Deserves a higher rating.
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,8,"It is depressing to see some people trashing this movie because it doesn't have jump scares. These are the same people who make Annabelle and Ouija blockbusters.The Babadook is nothing like these cash grabs. It has a terrific screen play, written by debutante director Jennifer Kent herself. She is in my opinion one of the best horror filmmakers. She understands the genre and does not resort to cheap tricks to sell her movie to today's attention-lacking-and-hungry-for-jump-scares audience.The lead performances by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman are also amazing. This is a movie which will inspire debates about it's themes and layers among cinephiles. I just hope this doesn't become that underrated horror movie that everyone talks about but no one seesBut I am pretty sure some people will hate this movie if they watch it expecting a monster flick. The marketing campaign for this movie was really misleading.THIS IS NOT A MONSTER FLICK. IT'S A PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR FILM AND IT'S AMAZING."
" Disappointing
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,4,"I had read a fews ok reviews about this film, butI felt this was totally nonsensical, which I generally dislike in a movie and this was no different.Tries to scare with ridiculous attempts to build tension filled moments, 'baba dook dook dook' WTF?, but failed miserably throughout. There are not many decent horrors that have captured, as they fail miserably at the things i have just described.As a person that would regard horror as one of my favourite genres i am quite critical and give credit where credit is due. This deserves little credit."
" Ba-Ba-BAD movie
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,2,"It wasn't even a horror movie. A quiet good plot BUT not scary at all with a bad ending. When you have to ""face"" the evil thing that haunts you or your house, there is something you have to do to deal with, not just scream and end of the story. Oh sorry, you have to feed him just to keep him quiet. No, no and no."
" Blessed be the fast forward
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,2,"Whoa. Poor short movie material stretched to 1h30m - good thing I skipped through this in 35-45 minutes, looking for the movie to live up to the rating.You really should never trust IMDB ratings or even metacritics, that's for sure. Even with all the real ratings in which people actually describe their excruciating pain of dragging themselves through this horrific movie, the rating is still 6.8 which should indicate an amazingly good horror (since they tend to score lower). That's NOT the case.I found the boy's acting INSANELY annoying which in itself breaks the movie. I'm usually most sensitive to bad acting in my native language, but everything from the dialog to the body language of the main characters is hugely annoying.However, the movie goes waaaay beyond in it's efforts to candidate for the title of worst movie ever.It could have been a good movie because of the psychological aspect, but the plot doesn't align with the story which results in a unengaging, bleek, lifeless and pointless utter waste of time.The setting in the house is unbelievable bleek which is obviously intentional, the light is sharp and cold, there's no warmth, no humor, no charm, no twists, no surprises, no satisfying scares, no food for thought and no merits really, except maybe for the visual effects which are pretty well executed. That's why I try and stay objective by rating it 2/10.I find it difficult to believe that anyone can be entertained by this piece of crap and I strongly advise that you spend your valuable time on something else.Just about any other movie will be better, I think."
" The Babadook Review
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,7,"The film is more that a classic horror movie with lots of clich矇s or jumpscares. In ""The Babadook"" character development, psychology horror and clever metaphors are on point. Overall, the acting was pretty good, not perfect though. Also, in some cases special effects were bland, which minimised the creepiness of the movie. Totally recommended!"
" I cant' even describe how bad it was. Sorry
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst horror movies in whole history! Eh people, did u really like this film? Really? I saw nothing but a hysterical movie had nothing really to say, the director has not any idea about how to entertain or how to scaree people, this was really bad and the worst spend money i ever gave to a theater."
" Its got some good and some bad
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,6,"The film was good mostly but a couple of things ruined the film for me
SFX sounded less scary and more funny and confusing (The babadook sounded like a T Rex!) And the smoke effect when she's dreaming felt like it wasn't communicated well enough as a car crash and felt out of place
Things like this take me out of the horror experience I was feeling and it was going so well
Blood could have been used more in the film, it was really lacking
Overall it's a creepy movie and I give props to the atmosphere it gave off (Most of the time)
And the soundtrack is amazing"
" The Ba-Ba-Ba, the Dook-Dook-Dook, that's all we need to scare you with!
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,7,"You always need to be wary and skeptical of new horror movies that are coming out and instantly receive unanimously praising reviews from the press and international festival juries. Journalist have quota, festivals need positive publicity, and in the end, you are left behind feeling disappointed and ripped off. I also can't help thinking that our quality norms and standards for horror movies have severely lowered over the past decade. In recent years I've seen numerous horror movies that are world-widely labeled as original, genuinely terrifying and atmospheric, like ""The Conjuring"", ""Don't Breathe"", ""The Witch"", ""It"", ""A Quiet Place"" or ""Get Out"". Don't get me wrong, ALL of these are more than adequate, clever and recommendable horror/thriller films, but NONE of them are the mind-blowing and astoundingly petrifying masterpieces that their ratings or reviews suggest.Does this statement also apply to ""The Babadook""? Yes and no, I'd say. ""The Babadook"" is definitely a different and less conventional type of supernatural horror story. Writer/director Jennifer Kent clearly didn't feel obliged or pressured to make a traditional and mainstream blockbuster, and even downright refuses the use of typical genre cliches like false scares, polished and attractive lead characters or textbook villains/monsters. The ultimate proof of her devoted intentions, I think, is the fact that she keeps ownership of the film's legal rights just to prevent that someone will ever make a sequel. How exceptional is that in the horror industry? What Jennifer Kent did bring to the screen with ""The Babadook"" is a very personal, tangible and harrowing family drama that utmost benefices from its slow-pacing, foreboding atmosphere, bleak filming style and majestic performances (Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman). As to be expected from a psychological horror tale of this allure, it's a film with many layers; ambiguous and open for various interpretations.Is the Babadook real or a fragment of the two emotionally troubled protagonists' imaginations? To be quite honest, I don't know. I'm not necessarily seeking out intellectual or thought-provoking cinema. I already have a lot of thinking to do for my job and I try to contemplate more deeply about raising my children, but I don't feel the desire to over-analyze every scary movie that I watch. I do tend to concur with the fellow reviewers who see ""The Babadook"" as an allegory on unprocessed traumas, everlasting guilt, difficult childhood years and the lack of strong role models. What matters is that Jennifer Kent masterfully brings the titular monster to life in a subtle yet unsettling fashion, and that both Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman empower its frightening existence through their stellar performances. Especially Davis is astounding, and I caught myself thinking stuff like: ""Get some sleep, you poor woman"") several times. ""The Babadook"" perhaps isn't the masterpiece that certain reviews claim it to be, but it's a truly impressive film and a must-see for genre fanatics. Jennifer Kent is familiar with the genuine masterpieces of horror, by the way, because her film contains footage of Mario Bava's ""Black Sabbath/I Tre Volti Della Paura""."
" Something similar but still different.

",2019-01-13 00:00:00,5,"The Babadook (may include spoilers, beware!)Dook dook dook - oh my darling, knock three times on the ceiling if you want me (while Tony Orlando and Dawn's singing voices playing in your head and it brought you back to riding your bike down the country road with ""Now & Then""). The more we researched the meaning of the movie and dug into fine details, the more the movie made sense and the motivations were revealed. First off, where did the book come from? We think that Amelia (the mother) may be our culprit. Who was a children's author out of work for 7 years? We believe she manifests this book and creature due to her inability to let go of her deceased husband, Oscar. Just like good ole Beetlejuice, no one should ever say ""Oscar"" 3 times fast! Baba means ""Father"" (yup, literally) and who appears just a few more times to spend fleeting moments with Amelia...her late husband! She also decided to domesticate this entity to live in their basement, eating worms forever. Worms are known to be symbolic of being divided between death and renewal; all in all too perfect. Something's slimy here. Are there any other Babadooks, or Mamadooks, or Marmadukes?? You can't get rid of me.SuperlativesWorst Mother: Amelia - Oh, your child continues to bring weapons to school, no big deal. Just keep him at home with you. However, AWESOME acting. You were believable Essie Davis.Best Dressed: The Babadook, always looking dapper.Most likely to pursue a career as an Accountant: The drab colors that were used for the entire movie. The colors reeked of depression. However, the music transitions were phenomenal and did make up for that!Overall Grade: B-"
" Too many questions left at the end of the movie
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,2,"If you like movies that don't explain the the backstory of the ""bad guy"" or it's origin and reason for existing then watch this movie. But it wasn't for me. I wish I had never watched. Precious time I won't get back."
" Ignore the low ratings
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,10,I have no idea why this film is being given so many 1 star ratings. It was hands down one of the best horror films the come out in the past decade or so. Highly recommend watching it. Doesn't rely on jump scares but makes for a very unsettling watch.
" Intelligent and critically acclaimed psychological terror
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,8,"Truly good horror movies do more than just dole out the jump scares and other cliches. Expertly written horror teases the idea that what is happening on screen actually has a plausible explanation - once we understand what is causing the characters to experience hallucinations and mental illness. The Babadook successfully manages this feat.Amelia is a single parent grieving the loss of her husband while simultaneously raising her only son, who is showing signs of autism. While her son has an overactive imagination - seeing monsters and the like - the tension and isolation he causes to his mother's life leads her to a mental breakdown. Enter the Babadook, asking to be let in.What makes the Babadook particularly special is that despite it's horror, it shows genuine compassion to people suffering from the real, invisible, and ever present monsters. Whether that be nurses looking after the elderly with dementia, a mother managing a son with autism, or the feelings of powerlessness experienced by community doctors and support workers. The strain of looking after others with mental problems often causes the carers to fall down into the same hole.The Babadook is all the more grounded and terrifying because once the patient, intelligent, and observant viewer completes the necessary detective work from the clues in the film - the Babadook is unmasked for what it is.
What makes it truly terrifying, is that we could start seeing the Babadook all around us in our own society,"
" It had potential...
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,3,"Have you ever been out somewhere and noticed someone's kid losing it, and thought to yourself: ""glad I don't have to deal with that at home."" Basically this movie is two hours of that.If it was strictly a monster movie it could've been entertaining, the setup of the ""Babadook"" character was spooky but lost its touch quickly. The monster being the personification of their grief ruined the movie for me. Any scares went out the window at that point."
" The Kid is beyond annoying!!!
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,2,"To be honest I don't really enjoy kids in the movies, especially if they don't know how to act. Of course there are exceptions, and I can tolerate those movies. But OMFG in this movie! first half hour is a struggle, I understand they are trying to tell a story, but why the hell this kid is screaming all the time? And why the hell he has to be so annoying... if you can get passed that, this movie isn't that bad."
" A unique horror movie
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,8,"Digging down to the depth of sadness and fear, this very symbolic film presents the harsh environment of loneliness and helplessness. I haven't watched a good movie for a while even though I watch at least for o five movies a week. theActing is brilliant, plot and the scenario are as well excellent.give it a shot, you wont regret it."
" A subtle, atmospheric horror movie
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,7,"The Babadook does a great job of making its audience feel uneasy. This film creates a subtle, atmospheric horror instead of relying solely on jump scares. The acting is also quite good. Noah Wiseman is a little terror and you can't help but worry about poor Essie Davis' sanity. The ending could have been better, but this is a unique and unsettling scary movie."
" new level of annoying
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,1,Wanted to like it but the kid was way too annoying not a good sign for a movie when you keep hoping the (monster?) Kills a child just to relieve the stress headache induced every time he's on screen.
" A Must Watch!!!!
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,5,"An absolutely stellar piece of movie film making. From beginning to end the watcher is on a nonstop coaster ride of suspense, horror and thrills. A true delight to watch leaving a unforgettable experience for the viewer."
" Make your own judgment
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,4,"I made the mistake in reading the reviews before actually watching the film, thought the film was very depressing, even at the end when you'd expect them to be much happier, it's very depressing! It didn't make me jump once throughout the movie although there were some creepy parts, and the young child did brilliant in such a hard role."
" Watch this if you want to be annoyed for 1 1/2 hrs.
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,1,"After appearing in nearly every ""Must watch - Horror""- list I thought iI give it a shot.I read much about the films originality. And although it is true that the film is somewhat atypical, it is in no way original. There is an abundance of cliche tropes like the good old ""shaggy search technique"", ""objects appearing out of nowhere"", ""it was all just a dream ... or was it?!?"" to name a few. And make no mistake, I quite like a trope-riddled movie when it is executed competently like ""Train to Busan"".The Characters were written so badly that I found myself checking the runtime again and again. The 2 Protagonists are so incredibly annoying. And in my opinion this isn織t the fault of the actors but the horendous writing.The Plot is slow and predictable (aside from ""what stupidity are the protagonists trying to do now?"") if you have seen any horror film before this one.All in all it was just annoying to sit through and not something that I will ever watch again."
" ""The Babadook"" - an interesting horror movie with pretty good acting
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,8,"Clearly, people who are giving this movie a 1-star review have no idea what makes a horror movie good.At first sight, when you start watching this movie your first question will be:""Are these actors that bad or they are literally becoming some psychotic characters?"". And yes, as you watch the movie you will figure it out how the actors and their characters are the same person. In the last couple of years the majority of actors featured in horror movies had their acting extremely mediocre, like all they wanted to do is simply say their lines and then go home. But is not the case in ""The Babadook"". When I first saw Samuel (Noah Wiseman) I really believed his acting was bad, but after a couple of scenes I realized how good his acting was as you truly believe there is something wrong with this boy or that he is simply mad.True, the special effects aren't the best (some of them are quite pathetic if you ask me) however these are not stopping the movie from being a good one. There is a constant tense and fear in this movie, intensified by the soundtrack and common noises (doors opening, floor cracking and so on), but these sounds are the right ones at the right time.When it comes to storyline, you can say it's a pretty original idea (as for me, I think I never heard of the word ""Babadook""). There are a few moments in the story where you will find the mother's and boy's dialogues as being annoying, due to Samuel's hysterical screams, but this is an important part of his character.Overall, I think ""The Babadook"" is an interesting and good movie and it reminds you of the classic horror movies of the '90s."
" Worst movie ever
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,1,"A complete waste of time. poor script, nothing is connected and the end sucks. I reply regret to have watched this ""movie"" thing. I have no words to describe how angry at me I am."
" unrealistic
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,1,"We found this film totally unrealistic and it simply made the woman, suffering from the loss of her husband, look like a nutcase that just hid inside her house and went crazy. I think women are more intelligent, stronger and more capable of dealing with these crises, of seeking help, of sharing and getting good advice, of acting in a more positive, sensitive and realistic manner. It is so stereotypical of the weak woman that it made me sick and annoyed."
" Essie David Makes This Movie For Me
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,9,"I am not very familiar with the actress, who plays the mother in this movie. It is a good film of course, but I did not find it that terrifying, although maybe I should have. I probably have just seen too many scary movies. Thing is, Essie David is utterly TERRIFYING in this! She starts off a tad unhinged, but is crazier as each scene goes on! It's insane and I did not expect this. Maybe this is an unfair comparison, but this film was WAAYYY better than Hereditary was, and I did not like that movie very much as is, but Essie David's performance blows Toni Collette's out of the water, and that is saying a lot, because Collette's performance was pretty spot on, in a movie I did not even like... Essie's performance when the Babadook possessed her was FLAWLESS!!! Her facial expressions and her entire performance was animal-istic! I do not think we get to see this sort of thing that often! Also, nobody physically portrayed the Babadook in this movie... This entity was just a matter of phenomenal camera work, special effects, sound effects, some props, editing, and the performances of David and her young child actor co-star. This film has nothing to do with cults or anything like that. This is simply an evil entity in the disguise of a fairy tale from a pop-up kids book."
" One of the worst horror movie
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,4,This one of the worst horror movies ever seen. It seems like a great horror movie at some places but most of the time its all over the place. Story of the movie seems to have a great potential but it loses its power while coming towards the end. Expected more from it.
" I couldn't finish this movie.
",2018-10-10 00:00:00,1,"The Plot was meh. The scares were decent, but this movie shoots itself in the foot, multiple times. One of the main characters, the son, is the most annoying on screen character I've ever witnessed. Do you enjoy incessant screaming from a five year old? Then you'll love he babadook. The first 45 minutes are plagued by the wretched whining and literal screamin from this annoying brat. I get the movie is trying to show that he's been traumatized, but good god you could be more subtle. I don't think I've ever had a worse experience watching a film."
" My honest opinion? A pretentious pile of pure trash. Hard to watch.
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,1,"The Mother was a hysterical wreck and the son was an annoying wreck ball, loud an obnoxious, hard to endure, honestly. The monster was made of cardboard and animated in stop-motion with a very few CGI inserts. All this trash wrapped up neatly into a garbage bag of psychological metaphors with a ribbon on top. Nah, I don't buy it for a second, it's still pure trash."
" Creepy, but...
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,7,"I liked the creepy nature of the film, but I could not stand the mother at points or the kid at any given point. Very unlikable protagonists."
" One of the creepiest movies I have ever seen
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,9,"So happy Netflix had this, I'v been seeing a lot of buzz for this movie and i decided to check it out and i was not disappointed . The movie does not rely on jump scares , but rather the atmosphere and the drama with the mother and child . But make no mistake, this movie is scary as hell and after viewing it the first time I had troubled sleeping that night."
" I rate it Zero if i could!
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,1,"Long story short, There is no monster or demon just a crazy lady that imagines a monster!!! You will waste hours of your precious life hoping to get a nice scare but that scary moment will never come instead you will see end credits!"
" Nothing special
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,5,"Not bad, but i was expecting more Horror. Only at the end of the movie u saw some creepy scenes. The movie was a bit disappointing in my opinion. I Love horror movies saw alot of them and this one is not special."
" This Is The Worst Movie Ever
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,1,"The Babadook Is Awful. The Kid Was So Annoying, It Took Me Two Days To Finish It Because I Was Hating It. We Don't Even Get To See The Babadook. Again The Kids Screams Way Too Much! The Mom Is Kinda Creepy Though. But She Kills The Dog Which Happens In A Lot Of Horror Movies But Still. And The Ending Is So Stupid! She Is Letting The Babadook Live There? And She's Feeding It? I Hate This Movie."
" Are you kidding me?
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,1,"Classifying this movie into horror genre is a crime. Lot of reviews are suggesting this movie as a psychological thriller. Guys, do you even know what psychological thriller means? People are saying this is not typical horror movie with jump scares or monsters. Well there are scenes which are supposed to be jump scares and there is a monster in the movie. But none of us got scared by it. Don't you see it? It's not a scary/horror movie.PS: DO NOT INSULT THE WORD 'psychological'."
" Ba Ba BAAAAD
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,2,"A complete waste of time! There's nothing terryfying in this movie. Bad stroyline, bad acting, not even close to a good horror movie."
" Best horror movie i ever watched
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,9,"Amazing plot, astonishing acting talents (especially the boy). The movie gives creeps when remembers the dook dook scene. Ughhhhhhh.. watch it alone at night with headsets..... u guys r gnna scared to death."
" Seriously?
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,1,I don't know what people looks in this movie but this movie is totally rubbish!
" A total disappointment
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,2,"While the acting was stellar, the story line was flat and the script facile. My daughter and I watched it together, expecting some good scares but it failed to deliver even one for either of us. Descent was scary. The Exorcist was scary. Witch was brilliant and scary. Babadook was not in their league. For one thing, it was predictable throughout. There were too few characters to provide much external or secondary plot. The one possible injection of a romantic interest for the female protagonist was ignored and it was uncertain as to why the potential suitor was even brought into the script. He might have given the lead character a bit more depth and opened more avenues for a spiritual showdown so to speak. The closet and under-the-bed thing was same old, same old, except when the Babadook seems to have attacked them while the mother and child were under the covers, at which point the ghoul does nothing more than say his own name, as if that goofy incantation would shiver our timbers. Instead, it laughably sounded much like a drunken old man pretending he was Topo Gigio. Baba's two physical appearances in the movie are both shining examples of the poor production values in evidence in this movie. In one scene, Baba appears, suddenly, looking like a Hallowe'en mock up of Edward Scissorhands gliding along by his collar on a dry cleaner's pulley along the ceiling, clickety-clack sounds and all, and in the other we only see a bit of a jerkily opening wing in a dark end of the bedroom, which means what? Baba is a dark angel? That his wings suck and don't open well? The ending is ridiculous and a total rip off from Sean of the Dead, except in SOTD, it was funny and a little sentimental. In this movie, it just seemed like the writer ran out of ideas and opted to ask his eight year old for some guidance, and she or he came up with ""mud pies"". For me, the movie was not scary, was poorly written and scored a 2 out of 10 based solely on the great acting chops shown by the lead and the young boy. I'm astonished at all the fuss about this movie. Total hype."
" Really wanted this to be good
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,1,"Simply dreadful.Obviously a very limited budget, so well done on that score, but so disappointing.The story is poor. You don't have to have all the effects if the story's good, and you can create terror just as much from something unseen as you can from the visual, but this is way off the mark. It goes from one stupid scenario to the next, with a dour palette inside a house that is seemingly from the mid-eighties. If this is set in that timeline, it's not made clear, although in the ensemble's clothing and the protagonist's car it would seem that way. Nobody has a mobile phone, but the telephones seem modern.The cast is far too limited when the main characters are this weak, and I didn't find myself rooting for either the flaky mother or the annoying child. Aside from those points, this is meant to be a horror film, and there wasn't a second of it that was enough to make the hairs on my arms stand up. The clich矇s are all there: dull, creepy house, unstable parent, the knowing child, a concerned neighbor, incredulous police and of course a cellar. The 'Babadook' (what a ridiculous name!) is less scary than some of the costumed revellers I see walking the streets with buckets of sweets in hand at Halloween. Not that you really see it.The ending is so awful. And not in a good way.If you're easily scared, or a child under the age of 12, you may love this. If I'd seen this at the cinema, I'd have asked for a refund."
" Really Really great mix of allegory and horror
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,10,It's really good to see a female director make a really good horror movie and a good movie in general. Great job!
" not that bad but is getting boring half way thru.
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,5,Psycho mom and psycho boy plus a bit of a supernatural. Nothing new but a fair horror movie. Strong in the last 25 minutes.
" Refreshing perspective on the horror genre
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,7,"Major kudos to Aussie director Jennifer Kent, who managed to distill down all the pain and loneliness of being a working-class single mother, into one of the most frightening ghost stories I've seen. The Babadook represents everything good horror can and should be, with plenty of heart, humor and social commentary for good measure. Here's to female directors willing to explore issues all too often ignored in film."
" Don't expect the scariest, but it has great moments
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,7,"The Babadook is essentially one of those ""artsy"" horror films, to the point where you'd almost call it a Dramatic Thriller. This movie does not use obnoxious music or jump scares to get you, it's more methodical and about 70% of it is Drama. The rest is pretty scary.Plot- It's about a grieving widow taking care of her dysfunctional son, who begins to talk about this imaginary friend called The Babadook. The boy later tell his mom that he found him in a book of the same name, which the mother doesn't recall ever owning. About halfway through, the tension built really starts to settle in, and there are very memorable scary moments. The ending was intense, but the resolution will leave you asking ""How is that even realistic?"" or ""Why did that solve the problem?"" Writing- This movie is written very well in a sense that you feel the way the main character does. There aren't too many calm scenes that you'll walk away with, but all of it is realistic aside maybe some people constantly bringing up the dead husband to the widow. Acting/Characters- The acting was great, the movie is in an anxious kind of realm so it can be hard to really make every actor stand out. The Babadook itself was scary as hell although you just barely see it's silhouette.Quality- The film is shot perfectly I'd say, one of the cinematography jobs in a recent Horror film. The way they maintain the same consistency of shot length is so smart in terms of actually scaring you, since you never know when something is building up to that moment. The mood is well executed through visuals, some scattered music, and convincing actors. Overall I downgraded this from 10 because the ending is a big ""shrug"" moment, and it's almost too boring- almost. But the scary parts, as well as the build up to those parts make the film worth watching. A good movie to watch if you want a tame Horror film."
" Horrible and shouldn't be considered a horror film.
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,1,"This movie was a waste of time, I watched with a friend at a sleepover. We both agreed that we should've gone with my suggestion of hush. The scariest thing was when the book ""came back from the dead"" after she tore it up. The only reason we kept watching was because we wanted to see what would be written in the book. Quite frankly, I did not think this movie should be considered a horror movie.  If you would like to watch it even after reading this review oh well, it's your funeral. Just make sure your headstone has ""Died of boredom"" as the cause of death; I would STRONGLY not recommend it."
" Okay
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,5,A single mother has a tough time caring after a really troubled child who's like 6 or 7 by herself because the husband died the day he was born. That's surely enough to mess a little kid up and the kid was pretty screwed up in the first half. The mom some reason reads a really scary book to him which makes it harder and harder for both of them to sleep. Weird things happen and the pair think something is out to get them. I'm not sure if it is or if it's sleep deprivation and drugs along with that book that create a scary feeling for the pair. I'm not sure if I liked the ending which could have made it good for me but overall I just wasn't that entertained. The actors did a good job and I don't have complaints for them I was just a little bored and never scared.
" Powerful Australian movie
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,8,"This movie is a slightly pretentious, but powerful and original movie about guilt ridden mother and some metaphorical horrors, that ring only too true. Good cinematography, competent acting, original story, nice concept. A bit contrived and pretentious, but well worth a watch."
" Excellent
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,8,This is an excellent story of a mother going through a mental breakdown with horror elements put in. Some very creepy moments in this film but the ending was a bit disappointing. Great performance from the mum in this film and be warned her son can be a little annoying. 8/10
" scary but ending sucks
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,6,"Warning spoilers ahead!!Me and my best friend decided to watch this movie since it's friday the 13th and we wanted to watch a thriller. We enjoyed it for the most part, although some scenes were pretty disturbing and gross. The one problem i have with this movie is that the ending is absolutely awful (in my opinion). It ends with the babadook still alive and living in the basement. I thought that they would get rid of it and be done with the babadook once and for all, but that wasn't the case. I recommend this movie if you are looking for something creepy, but just warning everyone that the ending isn't too cheerful considering they never actually get rid of the babadook."
" No sequal? ok, then dont use this
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,10,"...or youll have to pay me.what if, in the ""next film"" The babadook kills off the mom, making her be with her husband. since the child is the one who couldnt let the babadook not bother him, the mother and the father haunt him until hes old and grey and in an asylum?"
" More suspense than horror, it builds to a frightening tale!
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,7,"What starts of slow and a bit annoying soon turns to an eerie film of demonic possession, with very good (yet subtle) effects. Essie Davis is excellent as the mother."

" Feed The Monster.
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,10,"This has gotta be one of my favorite horror films of all time. A creepy slow burn, its perfect."
" Ba ba rubbish
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,3,"It's hard to believe there is so many overly positive ratings about this film. It starts off ok and builds the scene, I get that. But then the last 45 minutes of the babadook is terrible with a weak ending. Save yourself some time and watch something else"
" 1*/10*? Get a grip!
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,3,"The moral of the metaphor is to contain your mental demons and feed them worms!
Why can't films have a proper ending?
The first 20% is a big worry due to the annoyance level of the son.
The next 50% is too slow as we find the point.
The next 20% is alright when the mother is 'posessed'.
The last 10% spirals into the merely stupid, culminating in an ending that is a joke.
If the demon or whatever it is had made her fulfill her destiny and ended bleakly it would have been worthwhile, but no the end has to be happy.
The fact that the mother resents the son and is irriatated by him as anyone should be, means we have all this other stuff about a book etc... that is supposed to be manifested in reality which creates what we actually see.
It was presented too literal to be actually metaphorical.
So in a literal sense the demon is a joke who can be shouted down and contained, in a metaphorical one you just get on with it as it's your child and you put up with it.
But this is supposed to be a film that thrills/scares and so the whole thing is a cop out at the conclusion.
It treats the viwer as a child and says 'you must not kill your annoying child' and 'contain your demons'. But this is supposed to be something that pushes beyond and says 'what if?'
She should have strangled him when she had him by the thoat, being staisfied the demon leaves and she realises what she has done and cuts her throat. Credits.
No need to kill the dog, as it didn't whine and shriek like the boy. So to run through it again, yes kill the boy as you she had all the reasons to, no kill the dog as she had no reason....
The rest of it, books and visions of an ACTUAL demon and flickering lights was just the pretence of a movie being made."
" Still a longtime favourite
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,9,"I've noticed a lot of negative and misunderstood reviews about this film, but I feel people don't actually take the time watch and understand even the main characters and how they are expressing their emotions throughout.This is up there with one my my favourites. The mother, who's clearly struggling at the beginning of the film, tries her best as a single mother to raise her son, Samuel, who appears to show signs of learning or behaviour disabilities.
Samuel takes everything literally. When hearing the story of the babadook, he feels it is all real.Now the mother begins to become an emotional wreck and all she can think about is the story.Is the book real?The book appears to the mother and son at her time of stressful dispare and then reflecting how she behaves amongst others. She then starts to 'play out' what's predicted to happen in the book, this could be all part of her worked up life and mainly the loss of her husband. (The husband is also displayed as the babadook in a later scene). This film makes you think outside of the box, if you actually spend time to watch it."
" Absolutely NOT for kids! Disgusting
",2018-06-06 00:00:00,2,"I so wanted to like it! Since is wasn't rated I made the bad mistake of thinking it would be okay for young teens. WRONG! First off, the mother is a confusing trainwreck who is in year 7 of widowhood but seriously unable to move on, Hence her child is warped. She hasn't got the sense or will to get her child help, nor do any other of the adults in his life, so you watch the madness grow. What the monster is, and where it came from and why, you never really know...some sort of madness coming from mom? But the deal breaker is this. I watched it with my 14 year old granddaughter and her 12 year old boy cousin. Imagine my horror when we see mom in bed writhing around with what at first seems to be a nightmare but then you realize she is masturbating!!! And her son walks in on her! By the time I got to the remote to turn it off, it was too late and I had 2 very embarrassed kids and one grandma feeling totally awkward. No one said a word, just red faces. There was no reason, absolutely no reason for that scene to be there. It had zero to do with the plot and served no purpose. I am seeing this a lot...movies made knowing kids will be in the audience and then snippets of outrageously inappropriate scenes with no warning. What is going on Hollywood? Do you have some creepy agenda with visually assaulting our kids? Do not show this movie to children."
" Terrible

",2018-04-24 00:00:00,1,"The positive reviews of this movie are an example of herd effect. It is simply a bad movie, with a poor plot and mediocre acting . The only interesting aspects of the movie are echoing ""The others"". The creepiest scene is the bingo game in the old people's home."
" Reviews for this film may be misleading...
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,5,"The main claim about this movie for a lot of people is that it is ""not the usual horror movie"" and ""doesn't rely on jump scares or cheap tricks."" Now for the most part, I guess it doesn't fully, but it still holds its fair share of jump scares. When the film tries to rely on just sheer tension and fear, it fails most of the time. Seriously, I think what kills it for me the most is any time a child is on screen. The child actors are GOD AWFUL. Especially the son. He is the worst. I hate and you will too. Guaranteed. There is certainly some interesting ideas and really cool story elements, but the Babadook overall is predictable, stupid, and not very well thought out."
" dissapointing and not scary
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,3,"The Babadook is a australian horror movie about a mother and her son who after the loss of their father/ husband are possesed by a spirit who is trying to kill them both. The cast of the babadook are Essie Davis,Noah Wiseman,Hayley McElhinney ,Daniel Henshall,Barbara West,Benjamin Winspear and Chloe Hurn the main cast had there moments of great acting but overall it wasen't very good. The story and visual effects were probably the best thing to come out of this movie because they were unique and strange but with the tone of the movie it makes sense that the story was strange and the efffects were stranger and the book and the babadook creatre were cool as well. Overall the babadook has some cool parts to it and parts enjoyed and i do think that in it's own way it was different and had some cool parts but the acting could have been better the story could have more action and the scares needed to be better and the ending could have been explianed a little better to the audience so i did not like it and i wouldn't watch it again and it needed to be better."
" The people who didn't like it were too stupid to get it...
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,9,"People are generally pretty dumb. When the average person watches a movie, they want to laugh, see explosions, be scared or feel closer to their loved ones. This is a movie for the High Tension, Se7en, A Clockwork Orange, Anti-Christ, Taxi Driver, Requiem for a Dream, Blue Velvet and The Silence of the Lambs crowd. One of its biggest problems is that people think it's a horror movie, it's not. It's a psychological thriller. People see the boogie man and think that's all that it is...it isn't. Although, I do dig the Man in the Beaver Hat.The synopsis is pretty basic, a single (widowed) woman has a bratty kid that she can't deal with. One night, she reads him a bedtime story that begins to haunt them. They have to deal with it. The End.Anybody who gave a negative review of this movie, saw that film which I just described but this is not Saw or Friday the 13th. This movie is way more thought out than that. Most people simply don't want to think that hard...but I do, which is why I am writing this review.If you were hoping for a scary movie with jump scares and gore, there are literally thousands of them. Although this movie has a little of that, this isn't one of them. For the record, I love a lot of those movies too but I also like movies that are smart. This movie is smart. If you don't get it, you're either too dumb or you lacked the attention span to care. I have talked to several people who didn't like this movie and they all thought (as did many reviewers) that it was some ""boogie man"" flick and they all seemed to tune out at the halfway point. That's when you really need to pay attention to this movie. If you watched the whole thing and paid attention to it and you still didn't get it, well, I am sorry but you're an idiot. I mean, they kind of spell it out for you, you were just too dead set on the Michael Meyers in the shadows to realize it.I believe in being honest with people and I stand by my statement, regardless of the backlashes or negativity my comments might create. I grow tired of catering to morons. If you haven't felt offended yet, then, this movie may just be for you. Honestly, it was harder to watch the second time around for me because I knew what the outcome was going to be.I don't want to spoil the movie but if you watch it, remember to think for yourself and pay attention when the book shows up on the doorstep. Just remember...""Whether in a word or in a look, you can't get rid of The Babadook..."""

" A horror film that needs way more explanation
",2018-04-11 00:00:00,6,"I had heard various people talk about this film and what I usually heard was that people really enjoyed it or really hated it. I fall in the middle as I thought this horror film had an interesting premise and it had me hooked wondering where the heck it was going with the bizarre plot; however, it ended up having a rather bizarre, in a bad way, ending. I have mentioned this in several other reviews that I have written about horror films that I have seen, and that is so many have something very promising as far as plot and atmosphere only to fail to fully deliver on said premise. Usually it is a twist or something that ends up messing with the ending or in this case the fact the ending made absolutely no sense!The story has a mother who lost her husband when they were trying to get to the hospital so that she could give birth to her child. The child is a young boy when the film starts and just about the most horrid acting child one could imagine. The mother is being completely overwhelmed by everything around her as the boy constantly lashes out at things and he gets taken out of school and she is trying to work too. She is sleep deprived and just really looks like she needs a vacation. One night, the boy wants her to read a book called, The Babadook. She reads the book and the boy becomes terrified that this thing is real. Soon strange things begin to happen making the woman question her sanity, but she soon learns that the Babadook may be real!The story was interesting, but the ending was just so strange. I was expecting mother or son to end up being the Babadook, but turns out the thing was real. Only, that makes no sense as you expect some backstory on the thing if it is real. Why did it choose the mother and son? What sort of creature was it? Why was the mom feeding it worms at the end? Seriously, that ending made no sense, I usually like it when there is a supernatural force, but in this one, I almost think it would have been better had the son ended up being the thing as he was portrayed to be quite the monster throughout the movie!So, the film had some interesting elements, but it did not fully deliver. A lot of wasted potential as there is just not enough explanation going on within. I had thought from what everyone was saying that the Babadook did not even make an appearance in this thing, but it was real and you had glimpses, but you never get to see its true form which is mentioned in the book to be truly terrifying, which is what led me to believe the son would turn out to be it as what would be more terrifying for a mother, but to learn her son is a monster. That would have been a much better end to this one. As it is, it is a horror film with a great build up, but disappointing payoff."
" It could have been a 8
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,5,But is a five just because of the heinous kid it features.It just ruined the movie.
" Im not that hungry actually mum, after all...
",2018-04-06 00:00:00,7,"The colourless decor of the house and it's sparse furnishings match nicely the weak and characterless personality of the mother. 
Even her clothing just screams 'drab'.When I first thought that, not long after one of her patients changed her mind about milk in tea, I felt perhaps I was judging too harshly, too soon.By the time her odious offspring snarls,""Do you wanna die?!"" (in a manner akin to Tom Araya from Slayer)
... she's become the biggest drip since the BFG had sinusitis. Calling her weak was nowhere near unfair. Her big plan to defeat the evil Babadook that has been freaking out her freaky son? 
Tearing up the book. Yep. That'll do it love.Although she does grow some balls at Ruby's birthday party when the rich WAGs are moaning about not having time to go to the gym. Although I loathe Samuel, even I wouldn't hold pushing Ruby out of the tree house against him. Children can be so cruel. ""Sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me"" goes the old saying, but I don't think a fall onto your face from 9 feet up is preferable to being taunted for not having a dad. Ordinarily I celebrate the weird people. I hate the idea of just being the same as 'the norm' so naturally rally round the unpopular one or whipping boy of a group (such as the emo chick in The Breakfast Club or Trash in Return of the Living Dead).
However in this kid, we have someone I just can't sympathise with. He's an obnoxious little turd. Although I expect he'd probably be diagnosed with some kind of 'spectrum'-based diagnosis by psychology experts.""If you're so hungry, why don't you just go and eat shit!?""

" Horror down to earth
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,9,"Babadook's beautiful combination of suspense and grief descends each of its audience members into a dark hole where a glimmer of hope is the only way out. The film is presented in such a way where character development and a story driven plot is displayed subtlety but also is very impactful on the viewer. The audience is truly able to sympathize with the main character's grief because there is no control of her surroundings. The sound produced throughout the film are harsh noises to make you cringe, from the grinding of teeth to the constant squeaking of breaks while the list goes on. These examples are few of many constant situations, noises, and images making the audience never able to become comfortable or safe. Babadook is its own work of art where this isn't a play-on from horror films in the past or using familiar horror movie tropes one may consistently see. Rather this psychological horror uses the suppression of this poor woman's grief to create this evil character the Babadook. Ultimately digging down to the fears of an everyday (slightly older) audience to create empathy and disruption of the everyday world. Jennifer Kent does a beautiful job of displaying a truly horrific roller coaster ride which doesn't need anything flashy to instill fear rather a dark realistic idea put into motion with the Babadook's character being an intricate part with all the right pieces falling into place."
" A deep look into the mind
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,9,"The Babadook is not your average everyday horror movie, instead of a ghost faced killer or horrific plague, we meet something more sinister, which is the mind. The Babadook does a great job of not showing you all the cards, it keeps you wondering about who/what the babadook really is. While not seeing the usual horror movie jump scares I still found myself at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. In the Babadook, we meet Amelia, a single mother struggling to raise her young boy Samuel following her husbands death. The story takes place in Amelia's home as she tries to voyage through life with Samuel. One night while putting Samuel to bed, she decides to read him a story, but this was not just any story, this was The Babadook. The book told the story of a being who comes down in the night and gets you, but this time the story did not stay on the page, instead Samuel began to see the babadook in the home. Samuel does his best to protect him and his mom from danger, but his attempts only create a rift between him and his mother, as the story progresses we see Amelia become more agitated to the point where she is possessed by the Babadook. Amelia, begins trying to kill Sam, forcing sam to use his craftiness to subdue his mother, and defeat the Babadook. In the end, rather than destroying the Babadook, Amelia was able to control it. The only question now is what really was the Babadook. In my opinion this is what makes the movie so great, is does not hold your hand, it forces you to look deeper to find the meaning. This film is a great allegory for mental illness, which is what the Babadook truly presents. In the movie we see as things get tougher for Amelia, the Babadook has a greater effect. That is because the Babadook never existed, it was all in Amelia's mind. As the story came to a close Amelia was able to control her mental illness, which is represented by the worms being consumed. This connects to everyday life, because The Babadook is everywhere, the only difference is it is up to you to decide how dangerous he can truly become."
" I'm Baba-hooked!
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,8,"The Babadook is a unique and ambitious debut film from Australian director Jennifer Kent. This film offers a chilling look into the life of a widowed mother, Amelia (Essie Davis), as she battles with the loss of her husband years prior, and copes with the difficulty that comes with singularly caring for her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman). The Babadook has continued to gain traction over the past five years as more and more people discover the horrific bedtime story it presents, revealing one of the absolute best horror films of the 21st century that can be found right on Netflix. As the viewer, we don't know whether Samuel is lying about seeing the monster he claims is real, and we aren't even sure if what Amelia is seeing is authentic, either. The concept of sleep deprivation plays a major part in the movie and messes with the minds of its characters as well as its audience, since sleep deprivation causes scary side effects like hallucinations and cognitive impairment. While in the end it is left unknown as to what the monster truly is, the finale is executed in a disturbing, uncomfortable way.What truly makes The Babadook so effective is that its plot appears to be rooted in reality, being based on actual psychological problems rather than just the supernatural. While many horror films rely on genre tropes and excessive amounts of gore and nudity, Kent offers her audience a psychological, noteworthy story that goes against cliches for a genuinely possessed woman monster, complex characters and an ultimately profound message."
" The Babadook: An Allegory for Depression and PPD
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,9,"**Spoilers**The Babadook is a darkly beautiful film that deals with the very difficult subject of depression and I'd argue post-partum depression. I think it's closer to post-partum for two reasons. Firstly, the film opens on the car accident in which Amelia loses her husband. This is a reoccurring motif in the film. She has a dream or memory of the accident over and over, creating an idea that it tethers her to her depression, but what makes this post-partum centered specifically is that Samuel repeatedly mentions how his father died on the day he was born, thus tethering his life to his mother's loss. Secondly, Amelia seems distanced from Sam. She treats him, even in the beginning, and steadily worse throughout the film, as a reminder of pain. This film is a dark reflection of the painful path of post-partum depression and how women with post-partum depression may feel drawn to kill themselves or their children. 
The most striking think about this film, however, is it's used of lighting, specifically in the house and how that correlates to depression as well. The house where Amelia and Sam live is almost always very, very dark. However, it always seems that there is a lot of light coming in through the windows. Upon first watch, it is easy to think that it's just a mistake in lighting, however, it creates a metaphor for the way depression feels. As though the light is right there, if only we could see and reach it."
" psychological thriller
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,8,"The Babadook film is one of a revisionist genre stage, where Jennifer Kent creates a new vision film with the different and unique concepts she introduces in the film. We see horror film concepts such as the possessed women, a final girl, and the abjection of the body. Kent introduces us to a small family consisting of a widowed mother (Essie Davis) and her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman), where a demented monster from a children's book called Babadook intrudes their home. Watching this film we can create a connection between the mother and the babadook. the babadook takes ahold of the mother and we see her hallucinations and lack of sleep, which adds on to her state of psychosis and even an attempt to kill her son. The babadook in the film helps address the underlying issue, of the taboo of struggling mothers who attempt to kill their children because they are mentally ill. Kent does a great way to show this because we see what the mother's perspective and what she is enduring, as well as the outside world's perspective. This is what makes the film so great because of its allegory and the way Kent projects it.The design of the film is creative as well due to the way the producer portrays the presence of the babadook. At certain points of the film we can see the shadow or silhouette of the babadook coming off the mother. We see the abjection of the human body when the mother throws up black liquid to show her body rejecting the babadook. Overall creates a new image for horror films."
" Tread Cautiously in The Babadook
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,9,"Audiences have been overwhelmed with the same genre tropes in horror films from the past few decades. From countless jump scares to insignificant horror monsters, audiences have been waiting for a horror film that exceeds and leaps over the rest. Is The Babadook that one that exceeds the rest? By just enough. Like its predecessors, The Babadook is plagued with the same traps in contemporary horror films that does nothing but bore the viewer. From the overdrawn score to the tawdry children's book chant of the Babadook, the film gives viewers a feeling that they've been there before. But, what makes The Babadook work is the hypnotic build-up of tension. And this tension is manifested from the conflict within Amelia. In the house, the overwhelming use of low-key lighting not only paints the ominous tone of the film, but also the inner turmoil that Amelia is struggling with. As the presence and pressure of The Babadook increases throughout the film, she becomes even more irritated and dangerous. She becomes more than just a helpless character in a classic horror film, but she morphs into the monster that is feared. Amelia symbolizes the breakdown of boundaries, becoming the embodiment of the abject. From the beginning, Samuel is presented as being the major conflict in the film. His frequent emotional outbursts and sometime violent behavior paints Samuel as the leading issue in Amelia's life. It is not until later in the film that the audience realizes that Amelia is the true destructive force. The constant close-ups of her face give the audience an intimate relationship with her and a deeper look into her emotional unraveling. And finally, the beautifully crafted allegory of mental health and instinctual repression is the major selling point to this film. Unlike many other modern horror films, The Babadook presents a great amount of character development and an in-depth analysis of a troubled individual. In this sense, The Babadook should be celebrated for not what it does well, but for what it does for its characters."
" The Babadook
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,9,"The Babadook is an Australian film directed by Jennifer Kent being her first feature length film. The film is about a widowed mother named Amelia Vannick (Essie Davis), her son Samuel Vannick (Noah Wiseman), and Samuel's obsession with being afraid of the monster within their home. Amelia at first takes this fear of monsters to be something that is normal for an adolescent boy, but soon finds out there is something lurking within the home when a book named Mr. Babadook finds its way into the home. The film gives us a look as to why Amelia is a widow, and how she is coping with it after all these years. On the anniversary of her husband's death the Babadook tends to grow in strength. The Babadook could be seen as an allegory to Amelia's crippling depression and sadness that she has dealt with for quite some time. The building of her emotions finally come out as a monster known as the Babadook. If you as a viewer are looking for jump scares within this film, you will not find any here. Rather, you will find a psychologically intense film that shows what true depression and sadness can do to a human being and what it can drive us to do. Jennifer Kent looks away from conventional horror films and the blood and gore that we may all be used to, instead she uses the human psyche as a plot point in this critically acclaimed film."

",2018-03-26 00:00:00,4,"Megan Kelly
SPOILER ALERT:
It is fair to say that the Babadook will genuinely have you checking underneath your bed and in the shadows before you fall sleep. This film turns a children's bedtime story into a monster in the night. Prepare yourself for the psychological and thrilling nightmare that dives deep into the mind. Amelia is mentally drained from the tragic events that struck her family. Meanwhile, her son, Samuel is coping poorly with his father's passing. Amelia is unable to move on from her husband's death. With the burden of loss and stress, Amelia's mental and physical state is hindered, leaving her susceptible to the Babadook. The audience questions whether this Babadook is from Amelia's inability to move on from tragic events or whether it is her husband, Oskar taking over her control. This film illustrates that depression or grieving can damage your mental state and leave the mind open to any dark avenues. Director, Jennifer Kent uses the Babadook to symbolize the recurring feelings of hopelessness and losing someone close to you. The Babadook grows stronger the more that Amelia denies his existence, just as grief does until it is dealt with. Until sadness is confronted, it will keep coming back and eventually consume the mind, just as the Babadook did. The audience will take away from the film, that dealing with these emotions could be crucial for one's health instead of delaying the inevitable."
" Babadook dook dook...
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,8,"*SPOILER ALERT * The Babadook, directed by Jennifer Kent is an Australian film about a distraught and lonely widowed mother and her son who happen to open up a disturbing story book that comes to life and let the main character into their lives. The widow's inner fears materialize when the Babadook enters her life. The Babadook becomes a metaphor for her deep sadness and frustration that is apparent in the blue and grey tonality of the house they live in that is extremely claustrophobic. Throughout the entire film, symmetry and parallels are drawn physically and psychologically that link the Babadook to the widow's internal struggles. The message is clear and the implications are severe. If the widow does not tend to her inner demons, she herself will become one. Meanwhile, her inner demon comes out every once in a while threatening the one she loves most in her life- her son. She knows she must do something quick before it is too late. The more you push him out the harder it is to get him to leave. She must confront the Babadook before she too, becomes a demon."
" Bad Book, Alright Movie
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,5,"What it lacked in plot substance, The Babadook made up for in technical skill and anthology of the monsters in our minds. Quite frankly, the plot itself was quite predictable - there are already a plethora of movies where the archaic mother creates an overbearing presence in the life of her son. This influence eventually turns into the demise of this child. On the other hand, this movie was able to recreate the archaic mother by making her more of a main character, rather than a character laying in the background. Seeing the progression of the mother destroying the life of her child seemed templated, and much too organized. The use of shots and lighting was the most redeeming quality of the movie, as this combination created this absent-presence of a creature in the house, as well as the monster itself. Close-ups and low-key lighting are the saving grace of this film. The anthological anecdote of psychological disorders was fantastic. The Babadook was able to show that these mental disabilities are not static. Through Amelia, played by Essie Davis, the audience saw this brewing of an internal conflict; starting with the death of her lover, then slowly progressing to the stress of a mundane job and a misfit son, this notion of depression, along with many other symptoms, was clear and done in respectably. Having both its ups and downs, The Babadook, though failing in certain aspects, found a way to barely climb out of the whole it dug itself."
" The Babadook
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,6,"The Babadook
 SPOILER ALERT
 How far can the love between a mother and son go? In this film Amelia (Essie Davis) and Samuel (Noah Wiseman) must trust each other in order to banish this evil from their bodies. 
 The Babadook is a beautifully crafted film directed by Jennifer Kent, her use of a simple yet brilliant set makes the horror even more real. The film takes place mainly within the home of Amelia and Samuel making the horror more personal and more real. Their home reflects the grief that Amelia still feels for her husbands death. The gray scale of the walls as well as her locked basement containing her husbands belongings emphasizes her inability to move on. Kent's use of shadows and low-key lighting makes the audience anticipate what could be lurking in the shadows. This builds the suspense for the audience and feeds on everyones common fear of the dark.
 Kent cleverly uses the ""monster"" or the Babadook as an allegory for Amelia's grief for her deceased husband. The Babadook feeds off of Amelia's internal conflict of both loving and blaming her son. This becomes apparent when the Babadook takes over her body, she is no longer a loving mother, she verbalizes her blame to Samuel. Amelia now must overcome her new urge to harm Samuel. Amelia's love for Samuel and Samuel's love for his mother is what saves them both and strengthens their bond with one another."
" True Terror with a Great Plot
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,9,"I would highly recommend this movie. Not only was I shaking in my seat for most of the film, but the film is also eloquently designed. POTENTIAL SPOILERS: There are two key contrasts in this film that made it so critically acclaimed, which are the physical vs psychological manifestation of the Babadook and mother vs son as the victim of the Babadook. These two contrasts are played on throughout the entire film to create an elegant story and fear around the Babadook. ACTUAL SPOILERS: The mother/son as victim of the Babadook is seen multiple times throughout the film; such as, when the son has his manic fit and passes out and the mother becoming ""possessed"" in the later portion of the film. This contrast is used to develop the story of the babadook. As told in the book, the babadook feeds and grows off of the denial of it, which is seen in the mother's repression of babadook's existence. This only causes the babadook to grow stronger from the mother and attacks her more both physically and psychologically. This contrast of the babadook's manifestations is what truly makes this creature terrifying. The babadook attacks the mother through the fear and repression of what her eyes are seeing, but it specifically attacks her psyche to the point of possession in the later half of the film. These two contrasts create the perfect analogy for the allegory behind the babadook, which is the repression of her husband's death. This is shown perfectly through the effect that the babadook has on her and her son."
" Artistically beautiful, but rather dull
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,5,"The Babadook is an interesting horror film, with an extremely low budget, only so much could be accomplished. Taking their budget into consideration, it is incredible what Jennifer Kent was able to manage. The sets were dark and grim and played off of Amelia's grief and depression. The use of dark colors and low lighting played off of what was going on in her mind, with something always lurking in the shadows. The use of this monster as a visual representation of the grief and depression taking over her mind is a beautiful allegory. Although this movie is artistically gorgeous, as a horror film, it doesn't quite do it for me. The concept is scary, yes, however the movie as a whole felt slow and not very suspenseful. I wasn't drawn in and found both of the characters to be rather annoying, preventing me from growing to like and care about them. I feel as though this is more of a thriller than a horror film, even though as a thriller it's not very thrilling either. The reason this film gets a five out of ten is from the directing and gorgeous sets and how they played with the story, even if the story seemed a bit lacking. Overall the film was average and what makes it so worthwhile is the mise-en-scene and sets, this is not a film I need to see again."
" For Out of the Box Thinkers Only
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,8,"*Spoiler Alert
 Throughout the beginning portion of this film, you may feel the need to pop an Addy (only if prescribed, of course). The Babadook is a film that starts agonizingly slow, however, do not let this cause you to make assumptions about the ending. The twists and turns are hardly predictable. Director Jennifer Kent brilliantly sets up the beginning to cause viewers to let their guards down. You most likely will fall into this trap as well. Amelia's rambunctious and annoying son Samuel is convinced that a monster is alive in their home. But of course, any sane adult would know monsters are not real, right? RIGHT?!
 The Babadook explores the confinements of the desperate mind and what it is truly capable of. If you believe a dark and dingy home is claustrophobic, imagine being stuck inside the immensely grieving mind of Amelia. She cannot get over her dead husband, and each time she looks at her son she is reminded of him. However, viewers get a quick glimpse of her husband, and holy damn, he was a hot, modern day Jesus (so we can kind of understand why she is hung up). In all seriousness, Amelia's desperate state of hopelessness takes her to places she never wanted to go; she becomes capable of committing unimaginable things without even knowing it. The most terrifying part of the whole film is that the Babadook is indeed real, and in all its horror, it may very well live inside each and every one of us. The posing question at hand is, are you going to let it in?"
" Our Blossoming Fear
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,10,"The Babadook is a terrifyingly stunning film that treats its audience to the minimalistic mundanity of a single parent household while descending into the depths of despair and grief-stricken fear that only an unseen force can create. A film with such simplicity in its art direction and complexity within its story and angular shots leads us, the audience, to further understand how destructive, beautiful, and horrifying our own denial and repression of memories can be. Using our childlike sense of wonder and imagination through the use of a storybook, we see the unravel and torment of a tapped-out mother dealing with the uncontrolled problems of her past and, now, with her son. The music in this film gives a sense of eerieness as if we have heard the faint chime or the grumbling growl that crescendos as we get closer. The Babadook takes the audience and throws us into an emotional and mental meat grinder. We are enthralled by the disturbance of this family ordeal and will stop at nothing, as the characters do, to look for closure. And yet, even though we may not reach a full closure upon the film's ending, we are left with a hopeful and subtle conclusion that leaves a bittersweet fulfillment. Jennifer Kent, the writer, and director of this truly wonderful film truly deserves the accolades for this stunning display of hope."
" Grief and Terror
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,9,"Kent does a spectacular job relating a life full of grief to a bedtime story monster. Amelia's tragic events in her life are a reason for her depression and the hardship of loving her son. As Kent highlights the gloomy, dark colors throughout the movie, Amelia goes through her life living in the past and not realizing what a promising future her and her son could have. Both Amelia and her son are stuck with a children's book, ""The Babadook,"" which ends up haunting their lives. The monster portrays the never-ending grief Amelia has in her life. It is not easy to get rid of the monster just like it is difficult to come to terms with her past. Her son has an unbreakable bond with his mother when he swears to protect her no matter what. He believes the Babadook wants to kill him and his mother and after he is medicated, his thoughts become out of control. When Amelia realizes her son's hallucinations might be real, she realizes that her son has been warning her.The allegory in The Babadook, I believe, is the grief someone can have once tragedy hits that person's life. That bottled up grief and no reason to move forward eats a person from the inside out. The monster in this movie portrays this by always coming back. In the end, grief will always be there, but there is ways to cope with it to not ruin the future."
" The Mind Monster
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,8,"**SPOILER ALERT**
It's okay to look under your bed for this film, as it provides unnerving terror through a children's book. Audiences are immersed in Amelia's family and the heartbreak they have endured over the years. Through a dark setting where one may call home, this family is being stalked by their past that has become their present. Amelia is on a constant journey of grief, allowing this emotion to anchor her in every physical and mental way possible. The Babadook portrays the burden of grief as a dark, intimidating figure who controls the mind and deprives this family of functioning by eerily weighing over the home and its occupants. This film shows audiences that one must come to terms and nurture such feelings, without allowing them to haunt their lives through a heartwarming ending between Amelia and her demon coexisting. Whatever you do, do not let it in. Keep it at a distance."
" DON'T LET IT IN!
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,9,"Let's rewrite the story of the widowed mother and the over imaginative/morbid son. Let's interpret aspects of Possession, Trauma, and even disadvantages that are made clear from other horror films, Amelia and Samuel. Let us see if the ones we love(d) will come back and haunt us with in the corners of our everyday lives in black trench coats, top hats and knitting needles nails...
While observing the clear depression displayed within the home and play of Amelia (the Mother) throughout the course of each scene we understand the sense of longing. Curiously though, even though this is a very smart and thought out book I have a question: Who left the Babadook book? Was it her dead husband (Oskar) who undeniable the Babadook has taken the shape of to control her? Or is it the way that we are able to see that poor Amelia cannot move on without Oskar? Besides that question we are able to see the beautiful increase of shadows within each shot until the Babadook has almost completely taken over. I'm not sure how Mrs. Kent pulled off such a beautiful and compelling story that pulls you in from beginning to end. But I can be sure of three things: 1. Don't read books that are left on your front porch. 2. BE sure to let things go, it's not healthy to hold onto them. 3. Don't let it in."
" I wish I could unsee this movie
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,1,What the hell did I watched. This movie literally gave me a sense of depression. From the story to acting everything is bad and i hate when the kid screams every freaking time.
" Mini Review on The Babadook
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,7,"Unlike many other films, The Babadook is a very clever and most interesting film. The Babadook was written and directed by Jennifer Kent, and she delivers nightmares that are specifically meant to haunt the adult minds. This film is refreshing because of Kent's decision to focus on the mother instead of the son. Yes, in the beginning, we focus on Samuels' well being and get to know him, but then we really start to get to know Amelia and watch her lose slowly her mind or being taken over by The Babadook. Thanks to Kent's great team working on the film, created the right level of eerie in this film. Which is represent with the cold, gloomy color palette of the film that added to the understanding of Amelia's depression. And also a standing ovation to who designed the layout of the house! Just the right amount of furniture yet not too crowded, great lighting, and small rooms to give it an almost claustrophobic feeling that keeps the evil in and us feeling trapped inside.In many horror films, many of the ""monsters' represent an allegory, for example, Romero's zombies are often allegories for mindless consumerism and consumption. I believe the allegory of The Babadook is what happens when emotions, particularly grief, have not been dealt with. Since Amelia dealt with so much trauma in her life, she is in denial and has yet to recover from the death of her husband and birth of Samuel."
" A Modern Proverb for Self-Care
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,10,"If mental illness could be personified - then The Babadook would most certainly be one of the top contenders. This film is not an ordinary horror film saturated with nudity, gore, or cheap scares. Instead, director, Jennifer Kent, delivers an intellectual film artistically portraying the constant battle that the human mind engages in- the id vs. the ego. Many horror films will portray mental illness as mystical and terrifying for the sake of shock value, but this is where The Babadook differs from other horror films. In this film, mental illness itself is not the source of horror- the consequences of us neglecting our mental health is the source of horror. The film's cinematography demonstrates how Amelia's grief has taken over her life. Her entire house is blue- from the wallpaper to the furniture. Blue is a color notoriously used to symbolize sadness, and in this film, it is used to color Amelia's grief. We also see a play between light and dark lighting in each scene, which is both a callback to German expressionism but also symbolizes the battle between Amelia's id vs. ego. This film delivers a lesson that anyone could benefit from- Amelia is in a clear state of denial over the loss of her husband as she has locked away his belonging and photos in the basement (i.e her unconscious mind). The film shows us the return of the repressed by forcing Amelia to acknowledge her grief and fight it. She recognizes that she cannot outright get rid of her grief, but she can manage it- a crucial lesson for anyone who may suffer from mental illness."
" I'm Not At All Sure What Actually Happened - But I Liked It!
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,9,"The first thing that comes to mind looking back on this movie after watching it is that every time Bugsy appeared on the screen I winced. Bugsy was the family pet. A cute dog. And this is a horror movie. And you know what happens to cute dogs in horror movies. Anyway ...What a well crafted story this was. A young mother and her young son (Amelia and Samuel, played by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman) are dealing with his upcoming birthday, I say ""dealing with"" because it's not a happy day for them. Samuel's father died on the very day Samuel was born, in a car crash getting his mother to the hospital. What becomes clear in the movie is that the father's death continues to torment both of them. As the movie starts, Samuel is a troubled child - unreasonably afraid of monsters (under the bed, in the closet and everywhere else) and with massive behavioural problems that make him unwelcome at school, unwelcome even by his aunt, friendless. He throws tantrums at the drop of a hat. And Amelia can't control him. One night he asks Amelia to read him a bed time story, and he picks a book called ""The Babadook."" Amelia doesn't know where it came from. It's bloody violent and graphic. And it unleashes something.That much I understood, but from that point on I became confused about what exactly was happening. But even if confused, I was admiring this movie. It's one of the better horror movies I've seen in recent years. It leaves a great deal to the imagination. It ends on a somewhat ambiguous note, letting the viewer interpret this in pretty much whatever way the viewer chooses. Was the Babadook real? Was it a figment of Amelia's imagination? I really don't know. What I do know is that this is a creepy and scary movie. What I also know is that Davis and Wiseman handled their roles very well, indeed. I especially appreciated the way they seemed to ""flip"" about halfway through - with Samuel increasingly controlled and Amelia increasingly out of control. And in the midst of the horror"" - you feel sympathy for both Amelia and Samuel, because of the husband/father's death, and how that affects how they feel about themselves and how they feel about each other and how others look at them and treat them. Regardless of whether the Babadook is real or not, they both obviously have their monsters to deal with, buried deep within them and coming out every year I would think as the ""birthday"" approaches.I give credit to the writers and to director Jennifer Kent. Kent set a great tone and atmosphere throughout the movie, and the writers avoided making this any sort of graphic, slasher-type horror movie and instead focused on Amelia and Samuel and how they dealt with this terrifying situation. This is truly a fine addition to the horror genre. (9/10)"
" A drift into insanity
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,8,"This movie builds up tension after tension but in reality not much really happens. Yet it is quite exciting how you slowly see Amelia drift into insanity. And who can really blame her? Living with this 6 year old kid leaves you no choice but to go nuts! This film leaves one of the best examples why not to have children at all. Period! Or is the Babadook real after all??? Herein lies the main problem. As soon as the Babadook is displayed you can't help but find it looking extremely cheap. Almost comedic. As the movie begins to build up to the climax it is an amazing thrill ride and even though I assume the creature was never meant to be in the fokus, at least the design of the Babadook could have been way better. Either that or not displaying it at all, to keep the mystery intact. In this case the movie would not turn into a weird monster flick but keep the viewer engaged with the insanity topic. I have to admit, I liked this movie a lot better after having it seen a second time, but to endure this horrible child and his tantrums once more was surely not easy. Thanks to that you may not feel the urge to rewatch this movie over and over again and that is a bit sad, for the idea itself worked out so great and The Babadook is one of the better Horror movies of 2014."
" Thinking person's horror film
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,8,"I'd heard good things about The Babadook, the directorial debut of Australian filmmaker Jennifer Kent. The sets, cinematography and acting are all top shelf, and the story is unconventional.Six years after her husband is killed in an automobile accident, widow and mother Amelia (Essie Davis) is barely hanging on by a thread. She struggles to contain her young son Sam (Noah Wiseman), whose behavioral issues are creating conflicts at school at with family members. Sam has nightmares of the ""monster under the bed"" type, but when a disturbing children's book called ""The Babadook"" shows up unexpectedly, it seems as though the monsters may be real.The Babadook is not a typical horror film. If you need to have the plot neatly wrapped up and all loose ends accounted for, you're going to be disappointed. *Spoilers follow*The Babadook is not a Hollywood monster or manifestation of evil spirits, it's a metaphor for Amelia's crushing grief. It's a version of the ""Enemy Within"", and is a manifestation of Amelia's grief over losing her husband, her anger at her son, and her guilt over those feelings. As the book says, once the Babadook comes, you can't get rid of him, because denying him only makes him stronger. ""You start to change when I get in/The Babadook growing under your skin..."" It's not a perfect film, and the pace can be a bit tedious, but it's still worth a look, or a second look if you're one of the many viewers who didn't really understand what the director was trying to communicate."
" The Human Mind... A Very Dark Place... !
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,10,"This film is like an exploration into the depths of mental trauma... the most horrific aspect is that it can happen to anyone, without warning... sometimes you don't even see it manifesting.61 nominations and 55 awards for this film thus far should be recommendation enough !! 10/**********"
" Well Done
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,9,"I must admit I very seldom write reviews or watch this genre of film. I had heard about it a couple months ago on one of the youtube channels that I subscribe to. This was one of those top scary films. And I must admit, it was well done. I went in thinking I would turn it off but I sat through the whole thing. Both of the actors Mother and Son were amazing, especially the little boy. I don't want to give much away, but I may even go watch this again, which I rarely do. Awesome ending for me."
" Seen Better
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,3,"This is the first review I have ever written, I usually don't write reviews but as a fan of horror and scary movies, I feel compelled to share my thoughts for the benefit of other scary movie lovers. I found the movie to be pretty slow and a lot of the scenes were repetitive. I also wasn't a huge fan of how little background music their was, it made it feel really bland. Some of the scary and creepy scenes weren't very satisfying either, not necessarily just because there weren't that many jump scares, but more because they just weren't as creepy as they could have easily been. The end of the movie also wasn't that satisfying, from what I understand the movie and plot are metaphors of some sort but I feel like that metaphor wasn't presented as clearly or deeply as it could have been, in fact I didn't really get it at first and even after reading some explanations of the ending I still felt like there were missing connections and overall it was just a weak execution. I would've also loved to have seen more of the babadook and learned more about its origin, appearance, powers, and objective. I think some of the characters weren't very well developed either and we didn't really get to know them. Basically, it was alright, nothing noteworthy."
" A Very Good and Very Scary Film
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,9,"I initially felt pretty discouraged from watching this movie. I remember attempting to start it a year or two ago and not getting past the first 5-10 minutes because I thought it moved too slow. I also heard it wasn't scary in the traditional horror movie sense (WRONG). Even though it was very well rated, I was too thirsty for exhilarating, chest-pumping horror to watch some slow moving indie movie that probably wouldn't even scare me.Boy was I wrong. This film is S C A R Y: in more ways than one. Just the idea of parenting that out of control kid is terrifying, and seeing how helpless the mom was made me feel a deeper, more profound terror than anything that can be aroused by a slasher villain. Yet, this is not even close to the only thing scary about this movie. There are creepy supernatural elements, disturbing imagery, and moments of spontaneous and enduring horror. I have a real soft spot for movies that play the ""No one believes me, they'll think I'm crazy, but I'm not!"" card, and The Babadook plays it HARD. This really puts a sour twist to the film, and it's hard not to feel really sorry for the mom. The main actress played the part really well, and one can definitely experience sincere feelings of desperation and dread through her. It's not a perfect film because the ending kinda turned me off. Still, it's at least a high 8 from me, and I gave it 9 stars here because it's definitely one of the best modern horror movies out there. I wish I watched it sooner, but it seemed to be sold as some slow-moving, ""deep"", pseudo-horror film instead of the genuine horror movie that it actually is. I'd say it's more similar to The Exorcist than a film like The Others, which is a horror movie I'd describe as slow moving and not very scary. Definitely watch if you love horror."
" Bring me the boy.
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,7,"The film centers on Amelia (Essie Davis) and her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). Dad was killed in an accident the same day Samuel was born. Amelia works at a retirement community. Samuel has an overactive imagination about the Babadook, an entity that is in the home and after him. His obsession leads him manufacturing ""Home Alone"" weapons and makes him unruly and creepy. Mom has difficulty coping. In the second half of the film, mom is drawn in as expected, and the only question remains is the reality of the situation.The film was a well done monster in closet type of genre. This is the type of film my mom would have me watch as a kid, then she would walk around looking crazy carrying a knife. Not that I turned out okay or anything.Guide: 2 f-bombs. No nudity. 1 vibrator use, nothing graphic."
" only one intresting idea and thats it!
",2018-02-16 00:00:00,5,"First you expect to see a good movie about some sort of boogyman, pehaps a movie which among many stupid slasher movies, reminds you of a periods where there were brilliant monsters like dracula, frankesntein ansd ... but it ends up to be a stupid haunting movie which tries to be more than a horror fiction, and that only adds more problems...it is enough to be a bad horror movie, let alone tries to be a psychological one... I start to get disapointed at movies these days. in one word, if you looking for a great movie dont watch it, if you dont have any thing better to do, maybe give it a shot."
" Horror... Thriller... Psychological drama... Perfection.
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,10,"Read as little about this film as possible. Don't watch trailers. Don't discuss it with anyone. Stop reading reviews. Just go and watch it. It may take a little time to suck you in but the film you watch will be unique to yourself, especially the conclusion.No one escapes the Babadook.If you are still reading, I assume you've already seen the movie and are just curious about others' thoughts. I will say that I have no idea what a non-parent might think of this film but as a mother of a 4 year old, this one strikes me so deeply, every time I watch it. I am a victim of childhood abuse and was terrified of the prospect of continuing that cycle with any child I might have- it's just one reason I avoided having children for a long time. I've also seen mental disease up close and watched it devour people I loved... this film is definitely not a stereotypical boogeyman for me but instead hit all my personal terrors. One does not *enjoy* a film like this but it definitely fulfills the primal urge that horror addicts seek- the addressing of real fears and terrors in a controlled manner by observing them in a fictional setting. There is little relief in the ending but there is a feeling of having survived and perhaps grown stronger in one's ability to survive reality as well."
" Horrifying but not very interesting
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,3,"Several shocking and disturbing scenes, barely connected with a thin plot do not make a very interesting movie. The main characters are very unlikable. so it is very hard to feel any sympathy either of the primary characters. I got about 3/4 of the way through the film before I decided to turn it off."
" The bad seed part two
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,6,"This movie is descent if you want to snuggle underneath the covers with a potential f**k buddy. Other than that this move pisses me off because I was literally sitting at the edge of my seat waiting for that bad ass little boy's throat to be sliced in half. Unfortunately, my wish didn't come true. He is rude, disrespectful, and he needs to be stopped. If I was his mother I would have drowned his bad ass in boiling hot water and then asked god for forgiveness right afterwards. Would I watch it again? Hmmmm maybe if I was drunk that way i could imagine myself jumping into the tv screen and drowning him my dam self. His character perfectly depicts the early stages of a diabolical killer. BEWARE AND GOODNIGHT!!!!!"
" Bad
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,4,"Reading some of the reviews that say people who give this flick a low rating ""Just don't get it"". Sorry but I get it, this movie starts off promising but fades too ridiculous. Mom and kid get some freaking sleep and cut the nonsense! The ending is obnoxious."
" Had More Potential
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,3,"The first 40 minutes of this movie I would say were pretty good. Unfortunately that's approximately where the quality of the film begins its decline, which is far too early by any standards.The kid was alright but I found him extremely annoying at times, the mother was abusive to the point it was off-putting, and seemingly relevant characters just disappeared (her co-worker). I get the whole frustration from the mother, but it dragged on waaay too long in the second half and I almost forgot the film was also listed as horror.. I'm just saying it could have been done better.. a LOT better.The scares seemed genuine and were mostly well done which matched the interesting concept of the film. Although again, the movie failed to see it through and fell flat before its horrible conclusion. I wanted it to just end before they ruined it, but there was still another 25 minutes and some awful cliches to be seen."
" The monster we create
",2018-01-12 00:00:00,10,"The little boy was amazing, what an actor, what a character.
The mother still depressed and suffering from her husbands death, partly blames the boy and is very abusive to him. What seems as a tooth abscess that has become infected and irritating has also possibly affected her mind with infection.
This has escalated her abusiveness and produced fevers which have produced many hallucinations. The BaBaDook is the Mother.
The son is very honest, very aware and knows that when the mother is good and not abusive he sees his mother. He wants to protect her so his ""mother"" can protect him from her abusive side.
When she pulls her sick tooth, a physical healing occurs. 
A bit of insight occurs and the mother is angry with her evil, abusive side.
The son says ""you can never get rid of it""
So the mother must lock her evil side in a closet.
A ritual of feeding it, or visiting it to calm it, to acknowledge it, because ""if you are in denial it will get stronger""
Look at it like anger management. Visit the emotion, talk to it, get it under control.
Worms represent death and also strength, as they are the strongest things alive.
Fascinating story, coming from someone who sees the monsters we create.
I just loved the little boy, what an entertainer, a magic magician, hope we see more of him. ""Nothing in my hands, nothing in my hands"" an oscar for this child."
" Excellent
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,9,"Do not watch this movie if:
1) you hate children
2) you don't understand trauma and mental illness
3) you prefer gory, jump-scare type of horror
4) you don't like psychological thrillers
This movie is a psychological thriller--a story which focuses on the psychological states of the characters. Some people who have reviewed this movie apparently aren't aware what a psychological thriller is. This movie isn't fast-paced or full of action, it builds atmosphere. It's one of the few movies that I actually find scary--because it plays on a parent-child dynamic we have all experienced. My only complaint is the ending, which is satisfying, but a bit confusing. Overall, this movie deserves a much higher score."
" Babadook understands what makes horror movies so appealing to watch.
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,10,"I like horror movies. I also like smart movies. Unfortunately, I find that 'horror' and 'smart' don't often go hand-in-hand when it comes to movies. Well, Babadook managed to close the gap and delivered a truly chilling, thought-provoking experience. If you, like me, are a horror fan, at one point you've probably found yourself desensitized to all the jumpscares, gore and ugly faces, immune to the over-the-top but ultimately futile attempts to create a credibly creepy atmosphere and yawning at the predictable twists of ""bland-horror-movie number 94841432"". Babadook ain't it. Babadook is different. It understands that throwing monsters at the screen or killing characters that we all know are expendable isn't what makes a horror movie scary. It is whatever is lurking deep within the human psyche. Not only the primal instinct of survival, but also the things we value the most. Abstract things like love, compassion, trust, happiness, acceptance. What makes this movie terryfing is the ever-looming threat to those things that we hold sacred. The Babadook is merely a conduit in the grand scheme of things."
" Could have been a cult classic, just classic.
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,6,"I will use the succinct last paragraph of another reviewer who summed it up perfectly:But still, there is one thing I felt was handled wrongly. Throughout most of the film, there are hints thrown, abundantly, that the Babadook isn't real. The phantom cockroach infestation, when the neighbour's name is Roach. Or the casual mention that Amelia used to write, ""kids' stuff"", which is a huge wink that she is the one who wrote Babadook, and probably then stitched it together after tearing it up. This all ends up being a distraction, smoke and mirrors, when we are clearly told the monster is real. And it feels rather cheap. Personally, I feel that the story should have followed that narrative and simply deliver a mother who hallucinates, goes insane and murders her son. It wouldn't be a twist or anything, it's been done. A lot. But the end result would be much scarier. Though perhaps too morose and likely not crowd-friendly, but ending up with some sort of cellar-bound incarnate horror pet felt out of character."
" Well directed, acted and a visual feast but missing the fear factor
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,6,"The Babadook can't be faulted for the acting, or directing, choppy editing and cinematography. Even the Babadook book itself is charming in a dark and quirky way. The plot and Babadook itself can be decoded after the film has finished as to whether it is a metaphorical or empirical force which is always an enjoyable post horror discussion. Undoubtedly a film about grief, depression and loneliness this film raises some interesting introspective points as well as questioning sanity itself. as it is better than many horror films out there I wanted to say it is OK viewing for most, I didn't find it remotely scary however but is satisfying in its slotting into the psychological horror genre with ease.But.Not entirely sure why all the adults hated Samuel without any understanding or care to understand his needs. Of all of the children I have known that have emotional/behavioral needs people go out of their way to understand them, most of all children. It seems cold and unrealistic that adults would openly detest him. I understand he hurt children but to loath a child for this who is clearly in need of help just appeared off to me. Don't entirely understand either why the Mum and child never really left the house. Who in their right mind if they were freaked out would repeatedly sleep in the same room and house night after night? Also, shouting at the Babadook made it retreat? I'll have to try that next time I have a creepy encounter. What is the Babadook and what does it want? I found myself asking that question throughout, what is the point of it if it is in fact real? I guess that's why people assume it is a manifestation of guilt/trauma/bereavement, she finally took control of her life and that manifestation drew away."
" Truly phenomenal psychological horror
",2017-11-24 00:00:00,9,"The Babadook is one of the best horror films I have ever seen. Granted, it won't be everyone's flavor of horror and though it presents it's fair share of jump scares, The Babadook does them differently and does not rely on them to carry the film. IMO, The Babadook was marketed so poorly. The trailer prevented me from seeing it for a very long time. Monster thingy from a children's book? Meh. BUT...once I saw it, it blew me away.The Babadook is actually a very complex story with a multitude of layers. It is not your average supernatural monster movie. It builds tension, frustration, and dread expertly and then hits you where you least expect it to. The acting is top notch, the cinematography is brilliant, and the mood is bleak and gritty and pulls you into the story that is unfolding. It's a film that builds slowly while making you feel uncomfortable and impatient, but it's done on purpose. If you can sit back, let it happen and appreciate this fact, chances are The Babadook will be a worthwhile ride for you. The Babadook does not spoon feed its audience and much is left to the viewer's interpretation but it manages to do it in a way that doesn't feel so distant or removed. It doesn't try to be scary, it simply is.Sometimes the scariest things are our own minds."
" What a let down! - SPOILER ALERT
",2017-11-09 00:00:00,6,"I've scored this movie 6 only because it is well made, well shot, it's intelligent and attempts to handle difficult subject matter in a mature way.This review has SPOILERS in so please stop reading now.I liked everything about the Babadook up until 2/3s in when we are still unsure whether the Babadook is ""real"" and that I was watching a supernatural movie, or if the Babadook is merely imaginary and/or a metaphor.The movie is paced really well. It builds up the tension and fear gradually and holds back until further on and keeps us guessing if the Babadook is real or imagined.I'm afraid the movie lost me when I realised that the Babadook wasn't going to be ""real"". I felt misled by the makers. They extracted all the jumps, scares, and fear that a ""supernatural"" movie would be entitled to then cops out massively by making it all a metaphor for the mother getting over her grief, and anger towards her son. OK, you might say that the fear and horror we went through before the reveal was justified because it made us feel as the mother might have felt but that didn't work with me personally. Just because it bravely deals with admittedly heavy issues does not excuse misleading us about the Babadook. I don't discount the films usage of the Babadook. It could have hinted at or openly defined the Babadook as a metaphor or mental phantom, and scared us as much as it wanted. But keeping us guessing till the end was a disingenuous choice in my opinion and left me feeling cheated, let down, and disappointed when I really didn't want to.I would have voted the movie 4 because of the massive let down. But I cannot do that based on all the positives outlined above.This is just my opinion. Other opinions are available."
" A psychological movie that investigates the psychology of horror
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,7,"Well, I am a horror fan, and I would not say that this movie is a horror movie. This is more like a psychological movie that investigates the ""psychology of horror"". It is not intended to make you scary, it is intended to have you understand your fears, and how you construct them both consciously and unconsciously. It says that the more you deny Babadook, the bigger it gets. Our emotions, especially intense ones are just like that. The more you try not to be scared, the more you get scared. Or the more you deny that you feel are afraid of something, the fear gets actually bigger inside you, unconsciously. As Freud says, ""the emotions that are repressed never go away."", as I remember. And at the end of the movie (here comes the spoiler), mom, who repressed her fear, experiences a catharsis of emotions, and faces herself. She differentiates between herself and her fear at this stage. Afterwards, everything becomes much more relaxed.I am giving this movie 7 out of 10 because it fails to have the story in a concise way. It has excessive prolongations. Though, the story is worked in a clear way, and it is a really good one."
" A frustrating second half dampens the effect of a spectacularly tense and promising beginning
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,8,"For the first hour or so, The Babadook unfolds as a spectacular film. The story is set out for us of a widowed mother named Amelia who has struggled to cope in life following the death of her husband. What's complicated the recovery process is being the mother to Samuel, a six-year old with serious social and behavioural issues. One day, Sam finds a seemingly children-targeted book in his shelf called Mister Babadook, which she can read to make him fall asleep. But the imagery of the book is disturbing, so much so that it begins to haunt (""Dook! Dook! Dook"") Amelia and Sam It's as soon as from the opening scene that we get a sense of the surrealistic elements the film will present us with. And everything right from the beginning credits click - the sinister atmosphere is developed, slowly and unnervingly. Amelia is exhausted but sharp, emotionally damaged but poised and self-assured. Sam is unstable, impulsive and riotous. Both struggle in a world post the death of Oskar (Amelia's wife / Sam's dad) and even their closest loved ones struggle to have Amelia and Sam a part of their lives. What makes this film spectacular in the first half is its gradual development and subsequent change of both its tone and characters demeanour. Without spoiling any of the plot, how the characters interact and behave in the beginning slowly transforms and this subtle shift is pulled off masterfully. Their is a loss in humanity that doesn't come off as contrived or forced. And with only a mere 90 minute run-time, it is done incredibly efficiently, something with which many longer horror films struggle. This is thanks to the incredible cinematography, direction and acting. This film is strongest when it suggests and doesn't show. Its buildups far exceed their payoffs - the incredibly subtle camera-work and construction of suspense is stuff Hitchcock and Kubrick would be proud of. In fact, in terms of a film creating a sheer tense atmosphere, The Babadook is among the best I've ever seen to do so. It is unfortunate that a strong first half is derailed by an unquestionably inferior second half, with a puzzling ending that will probably leave you frustrated. Nevertheless though, this remains one of the best horror films of the 2010s and certainly one of the best Australian horror films in recent memory."
" Journey into Madness
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,6,"I have been catching up on many of the horror films I've missed in the past few years, so I've seen a great many in a relatively short period of time. Judging The Babadook within this context, I was pleasantly surprised at the scare quality of this film.The Babadook is the story of a woman's slow, inexorable descent into madness, driven by grief and loneliness (she's a widow), and the stress and anxiety of raising a child with mental and behavioral problems. The pacing is superb as we gradually witness her unhinging, subtle at first, and then outright powerful toward the end. So overwhelming is her challenge that help from various outside parties - a kindly neighbor, school guidance counselors, a co-worker - is not enough to counter her fall.I also thought that creating a mythical horror character in a child's book was a refreshing idea as a plot device. (I couldn't help but view the special feature in the bonus section that highlighted the creation and creator of the book). This creates the Babadook as a metaphor for the doubts and fears of mother and child, and links the special bond the mother and son have, as well as the shared experience of having to go through these terrible travails together. Yet, eventually, the mother and son gain their strength and confidence together, enough so as to defeat those same fears in the end.I also liked the execution of the film, though it will probably be viewed as average by many. Most scenes involving the actual Babadook take place in darkness and shadows, which is expected, I suppose. And is it just me, or did they amp up the sound when Babadook screamed/groaned/shrieked? Ordinarily, I'd find this irksome, but it really goosed up the tension for me, putting me more on edge in certain scenes. All in all, there's enough uniqueness here to recommend The Babadook as a one time view, but you probably wouldn't count this as a classic that is a must-own."
" Did A Lot Right
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,5,"I really liked the premise of this film when I read the summary, but was ultimately disappointed when I was finished. Although there were a lot of spectacular moments where I felt my chest tightening, the amount of times an overused trope or predictable encounter occurred killed any scary vibe the movie had.Things I liked:-The use of the book (as well as the knocking) was a great way to introduce the idea of the Babadook without feeling like exposition was being dumped on you. When the book returned, it was one of the most frightening sequences in the movie!-The use of music (and lack of music) really set the tone. Many times a film will unintentionally kill the immersion by playing thematically inappropriate music, or playing music when silence would really be more appropriate. This film did a great job of building tension all around.-The set was fantastic. The layout, color scheme, and slight disrepair all created an amazing atmosphere. The thematically relevant television they watched was a nice touch.Things I didn't like:-In a lot of cases, the acting was a little over the top. Less is more in a horror film, and often times when trying to be scary, the extreme performance ended up seeming more humorous.-The appearance of the Babadook itself could've been a lot scarier. I had really hoped that this movie would deviate away from the typical scare tactics of other movies, but I was unfortunately wrong. They used cheesy effects to make the creature move quickly, and again made it seem more comical than scary. The voice modulation was also cringey and immersion-breaking. Again, less is more, especially with a movie with a premise as good as this one.-The use of graphic imagery to be scary was attempted in this film, which in my opinion is not very frightening. When done right it can be, but in this instance it felt forced rather than disturbing or scary. I will say that when violence was depicted in the pop-up book, it was done very well and was chilling, but when already foreshadowed, the actual thing seemed redundant.-Unrealistically happy endings always bother me, and this one is no exception. The idea that a child was able to perform an exorcism just by loving his mother and touching her cheek was asking a lot of the audience, considering how powerful the creature was shown to be. I will say that the black bile was a nice and concise way of showing that he had left.In conclusion, it's not terrible, and worth a watch if you don't have much to do, but don't expect to be scared very frequently, as the overuse of horror tropes kills the mood."
" A Smart Horror Film About Tragedy and Fear
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,7,"This is straight up one of the smartest horror flicks of the last several years. That said, there is going to be one major, deciding factor when it comes to whether or not you can enjoy this movie- can you stomach the child actor? Unlike most child actors, he does a great job. But he's doing a great job at being an insufferable little brat. For some people, this great performance keeps them from liking the film. Personally, I found that it added to the tension and to the strength of the film's theme. This movie is rooted heavily in metaphor. If you want a straight, black and white tale with no subtlety, go watch a slasher flick. If you're searching for an intelligent story that makes you look long and hard at some difficult truths, you'll enjoy this film. And along the way, you'll encounter some great, classic scares."
" The Babadook
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,7,"I had no idea what the meaning of the title is, apparently it is the Polish word for boogeyman, it is the name of a monster featured in this very well rated scary movie from Australia. Basically Amelia Vanek (The Matrix's Essie Davis) is a widow, her husband Oskar (Benjamin Winspear) was killed in a car accident whilst driving her to hospital during her labour, she has brought up her six-year-old son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) alone. One night, Sam chooses a bedtime story for his mother to read, he chooses a pop-up book Amelia has never seen before, titled Mister Babadook, as she begins to read, it is full of scary images, describing a tall pale-faced humanoid in a top hat with pointed fingers who torments its victims. Amelia is disturbed by the book, Sam displays increasingly erratic behaviour, suffers insomnia, and has a preoccupation with this fictional monster from the book, believing it is real, Amelia has many sleepless nights trying to comfort her son. Soon strange events occur, doors opening and closing by themselves, strange sounds are heard, and Amelia finds broken glass shards in her food, she attributes all of this Sam, but he blames the Bababdook, she rips up and disposes of the book. At Amelia's birthday party, Sam's cousin Ruby (Chloe Hurn) bullies him for not having a father, in anger he pushes her out of a tree, her nose is broken in two places. Amelia's sister Claire admits she cannot bear Sam, Amelia takes great offence of this, Sam has another vision of the Bababdook on a drive home, and suffers a febrile seizure, after a successful plea, a paediatrician gives Amelia sedatives. The following morning, Amelia finds the Mister Babadook book restored on the front door step, it contains new words about the creature becoming stronger if she continues to deny its existence, it also includes new pop-ups of her killing their dog Bugsy, then killing Sam, and herself. The terrified Amelia burns the book and goes to the police to report this threat and disturbing phone calls received, but she has no proof of stalking, she leaves when she sees the Babadook's suit hanging behind the front desk. Amelia starts to become more isolated and shut-in, being more impatient, and shouting at Samuel for ""disobeying"" her, and continuing to mention the Babadook. One night, Amelia has a vision of Oskar, but this turns into the Bababdook stalking her, until it takes over her and finally possesses her, breaking Bugsy's neck, and trying to attack Sam, but he manages to lure her into the basement, and knocks her out. Amelia wakes in the basement tied up, she tries to strangle Sam who is sitting nearby, but he lovingly caresses her face, causing Amelia to throw up an inky black substance, seemingly expelling the Bababdook. Sam reminds Amelia that ""you can't get rid of the Babadook"", then an invisible force drags Sam into Amelia's bedroom, she saves him, but the Babadook forces her to re-watch a vision of her husband's death. After this moment of utter despair, Amelia furiously confronts the Babadook, she is able to make the beast retreat into the basement, where she locks the door behind it. Some time passes, Amelia and Samuel have recovered from the ordeal, Amelia is caring and attentive to her son, they gather earthworms together for her to take to the basement, it is for the Babadook to eat, the beast tries to attack, but she calms it, it takes the earthworms to the corner, Amelia returns to the garden to celebrate Sam's birthday. Also starring Hayley McElhinney as Claire, Daniel Henshall as Robbie, Barbara West as Mrs. Roach, Carmel Johnson as Teacher and Tim Purcell as the Babadook. Davis gives a monumental performance as the single care worker mother mentally tortured by an uncontrollable force, young Wiseman is relatively good as the disturbed child as well, it is a very simple ""monster in the closet"" story, with the paternal figure questioning what's real and what's not, with small special effects, clever use of sound, visual scares and a feel of creepiness throughout, this is definitely a gripping and intense psychological horror. Very good!"
" Not Scary, almost comical
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,2,"I watched this movie because I read several reviews that said that this was the scariest movie currently on Netflix. The only reason I watched the entire movie was because I kept thinking ""this has to get scary, right?"" No, it did not. There was one brief flash where the Mom saw the Babadook in her neighbor's house and that was all the scare and chills for the entire movie! The son even looked like he was about to start laughing in a few scenes that were intended, I think, to be frightening. And the voice of the Babadook was cartoonish. I wasted my Friday the 13th scary movie viewing on this terrible movie."
" Very surprised at how bad this was
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,3,"One of the worst movies my wife and I have seen in a while... the only positive I'd give this film was the acting. I had a bad feeling the movie was going to be trash simply based on the plot, but after seeing high reviews and hearing a lot of positive feedback we thought we'd give it a try......... I'd say I'm surprised by the amount of super high ratings people give this movie, but a ton of people liked Blair witch as well, so I learned a log time ago ratings are often worthless. This movie isn't worth the watch, for anyone looking to watch a late night horror, don't bother..... this was lame as all hell. It was incredibly boring.... make sure you have a cup of coffee, or two... maybe 3..... some candy..... I mean for real.... whoever is rating this movie more than a 3, the hell is wrong with you? I'm being nice here..... I mean the reality is a good horror movie hasn't come out in a very long time, the vast majority of them are garbage.... but this crap simply shouldn't have been released..... the fact that the people who made this movie are allowed to make films again just about convinces me to go into the movie business tomorrow.... I could film my toilet and it would be more interesting and slightly more terrifying than this flick. My wife seems to be actually angry at me for wasting her night with this, and even though I had no idea, it was bad enough to where I kind of don't blame her. I actually got a kick that when you write these reviews you can click if your going to give away a spoiler.... what spoiler??? There's nothing to spoil..... although I'd probably buy a copy of the book that's in the movie, it's a whole hell of a lot cooler than the movie itself."
" This film is stupid
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,4,"I just read where someone thought this film is about mental illness occurring in the mind of a mother and/or son. It's not sophisticated like 'Session 9'. I think this film was made to be taken at face value, and it was lame. The basic concept of a sinister children's book could have been made into an interesting story, but they blew it. I was actually more impressed with 'Lights Out', since I watched both films the same week, and that's not saying a great deal. Even 'It Follows' was more interesting than Babadook. I'm waiting for a better class of horror."
" Horrible
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,1,What did I just witnessed this film was very bad I can't believe people an stomach this trash. No wonder there no good horror films they all rely on cheap jumps scares and annoying loud sounds like seriously horror films now I just cheap. Mainly now horror films are just based on demons and ghost and all that nonsense no wonder horror films are going into the gutters
" A ridiculously bad and non scary movie
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,1,I had high expectations when I started watching this movie and was simply disappointed. It is not scary at all except if you are 5 years old or under. I am a big fan of scary films but this one simply did not deliver. Not enough suggestion and poor scenario simply made this movie a non scary scary movie... a waste of time.
" The acting is wonderful, the atmosphere too
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,8,"Back in the days when I was a kid (I'm from 1979), I wasn't able to watch horror movies of the ghostly genre. Anything with a haunting atmosphere and sudden appearances of white, dead faces or the sound of creepy kids singing used to scare me to tiny scattered bits. I blame it on my late grandma who was once watching Don't Look Now, totally unaware I WAS IN THAT ROOM playing with a Barbie doll (not sure how old I was but must have been about 5 - thanks grandma, I couldn't sleep for months). I also see the influence of my late supernaturally oriented neighbor-best friend. She brought the best stories and the finest chills. She was my personal ghost story teller and she was the star in most of them. Maybe ghosts had become too real for me to tell myself ' it is just a movie'.But now... I find myself craving eerie movies, especially when alone in my house. WHY? Is my friend helping me from beyond the grave? Am I getting over my childhood fears? Do I need to ride this wave and finally enjoy it? The answer is Yes. And I want to see how much I have grown as a human being. So I watched stuff like the Conjuring series and Insidious 1-3 evenings on end. I'm not scared by chopped limbs and gushing blood and films that are too much about violence just don't interest me. I really need to test myself with ghosts and haunting spirits. Any tips are welcome.The Babadook was recommended by a friend and I read good reviews. Not really a ghost story I know that, but haunting enough I could see from the trailer. I placed it on the list for 'watching together' just like the Conjuring (didn't listen to myself though). The first time I turned it on I had had a very emotional day and my senses where pretty open. I couldn't get beyond the first 10 minutes. Somehow the vibe and scenes really got to me. I mean that kid! And what is the mom going through? So sad...The second time we got to finish the whole movie and both of us were left impressed. For a person like me there are good scares yet they are placed in a different context compared to other movies. The Babadook grows on you from the inside out, maybe that's so good about it. (And I literally mean the monster, not just the movie in general).The mom and son are so well portrayed by the actors and the relationships they have with others (the ones we get to see) are truly supportive to the story. The Babadook is serious - at least that's how I felt - and it gives a look into life with serious depression while dealing with the effects.It's gloomy and grey, with notes of a sinister fairy tale. Worth the watch."
" Disappointing and utterly banal effort
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,3,"Troubled by her sons' bizarre behavior, a single mother tired by his constant mentions of a strange monster coming after him turns out to be true when she soon encounters the vicious figure coming after him in the house and tries to save him before the creature can get to him.This one ended up being an incredibly problematic effort. A lot of the films' issues come from the fact that there's nothing about the son worth celebrating about the son here. This is one of the most irritating, utterly insufferable brat that ever lived the way he's portrayed here with his screaming for attention, the need for household protection measures that are far more destructive than helpful and a general air of total disobedience that borders on psychological intervention the way he goes on throughout this one. His screaming and hysterical antics are plain grating, and the out- of-control nature of how he behaves around her and others such as the neighbors or the friends' birthday party just make it nearly impossible to feel anything less than utter disdain for him. However, since this behavior is supposed to demonstrate how terrifying the creature is that he's forced the child into that state instead all it does is hammer home how despicable the kid is and that really drains the film of any chance to generate scares or thrills of any kind for most of the overall running time. This manages to really delay any kind of horror scenes here as this just turns the film into a dull, exhaustive drama for most of the running time. The other big issue here is the complete and utter lack of information here about what the titular creature actually is as there's nothing given about the creature's' history, what it's actual purpose is or where the rules about it come from as the entire affair is kept completely in the dark and is a total mystery. This also offers up no connection as to where the book came from or how he became so obsessed with it considering the reaction he has to it the first time she reads it for him which shows he is clearly afraid of the book like it's the first time he's read it which makes no sense if he's heard the story before. These issues are what hold this one down considerably and don't really allow the positives much room to work with. Those positives consist solely of the action found in the final half where the creature is finally let loose and engages in some wild chases around the house which lets this one get quite dark and chilling with the way it all plays out. This gets the film moving along nicely and places a lot of emphasis on the breakneck encounters which makes for quite a rousing finish. Coupled with a creepy look to the main creature, these, though, are all that work for this one.Rated R: Language, Violence and intense themes of children-in- jeopardy."
" Total waste of time
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,4,"The movie is nothing, no use and a total waste of time. It's a one and a half an hour film and 1 hr and 20 min would be full of story,no horror no nothing. Seriously nothing. Half the film and the ghost just said one sentence repeatedly.Ignore the other people and their ratings. Don't watch this movie. A total waste of time."
" Very average movie...do yourself a favor and skip it.
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,3,"Overall a very average movie. Very good acting from Essie Davis. However, the overall plot was moronic. The presence of the Babadook was never explained and the ""scare"" factor is minimal with only a couple of scenes even resembling ""horror."" Do yourself a favor and skip this movie...there are better scares out there."
" One of the worst horror movies I ever watched!
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,1,Wasted 1 hour 29 minutes of my life. No horror content. Misleading and mismatched story. At one point she is afraid of the Babadook and at the other she makes him her pet and feeds him! Ridiculous! Is Babadook even a ghost? He got scared of the lady and ran for his life and kept hiding in the store room in order to live by the mercy of the lady who occasionally feeds him with worms. WTF!
" Potentially Gripping Scenes Turn To Mush
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,5,"I went into ""The Babadook"" with pretty low standards and wasn't expecting a lot but unfortunately the flick didn't even meet those standards.If there's one pro to the movie its the idea of a monster coming out from a book and haunting a family, even if the idea is a tad tedious. However the problem in the way of this brilliant idea is the monster itself is barely seen through out the movie, if there's a horror movie in need of monster appearances to keep audiences fully hooked its this one.I will say Essie Davis is the strongest part of the film and gives a tremendous performance as a suffering mother just trying to scrape by who's constantly judged by her friends.Overall, personally this is a one time watch this one, even if the pros do pushed the cons away a bit 6.3/10"
" The Babadook is an innovative, intriguing and very emotional psychological horror film.
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,8,"The Babadook: Movie Review.The film has well developed characters, emotional character depth and intensity and very interesting character performances. The Babadook is a very mature and intense film that shows real life horror emotions and heartfelt character moments. The atmospheric tone and vibe of the film is dark, scary and creepy. The movie does not rely on some cheap jump scares, it focuses on realistic fear and tension. Imagine the feeling and situation, where a mother is trying to kill her own child, its pretty terrifying.The Babadook is an excellent film that depends on the horror of depression, loneliness, pain of losing someone, dealing with psychological mental issues, and fear of a monster lurking in the dark. The film does not relies on the common factors of horror, it's rather depends on its mystery and suspense factor. That's what makes the film more realistic and genuine towards its approach of genre based story telling.The direction of Jennifer Kent is brilliant.The performances are great. Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman, both are amazing in their respective characters and have given solid performances. The issue with the film that its slow paced and takes little time to build itself. All Over, The Babadook is a well crafted psychological horror film. (Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You)."
" Sorry, But No
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,5,"Not a good horror movie by any metric. Acting was over the top, story was complete and utter nonsense, wasn't scary, and left me yawning. This is what happens when you take a decent horror movie like 'It Follows', subtract the jump scares, subtract the narrative logic, and subtract the suspense. Need I say more?"
" Three stars is generous
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,3,"""The Babadook"" is one of those movies that starts off really well, and then plummets into predictability. By the last third of this movie, I was looking for the exit, and I was feeling sad that I had just spent $8.00 US to see it. Please AVOID this letdown of a horror movie. The plot is just so weak, that it is pathetic. If people on here awarded this a 1-star, I can understand that. I will never again see ""The Babadook""."
" Not so great, not so bad
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,5,"I really do consider this to be one of the greatest LGBT+ themed movies to date. It's marvelous how our community is so thirsty for representation in cinema that we actually filled dozens of tumblr. pages with memes which some brave souls enchanted with their unpaid photo editing programs./sOkay, I really liked Babadook for it's characters. I view it as a story of really striven mother who does not understand his son's special needs and has no real support what-so-ever in her day-to-day life. It tells us, once again in history of human species, that we need compassion and listening skills to manage in our lives. That we need to understand our differences. The leading lady is not the typical main character in horror stories, and I enjoyed that quite a lot.In other dimensions Babadook ain't that marvelous. Music is dull, acting isn't exactly worth an Oscar trophy and Babadook itself -- well, he's not scary. Meme status isn't helping that at all.I find the movie thrilling in some points, but mainly it's actually pretty typical horror story, IMHO."
" Good movie to creep you out.
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,7,"This was a well put together horror movie that has its super creepy moments. Jennifer Kent did a great job for this to be her first feature film, I was very impressed, she was able to create a vibe that almost made you feel like you were watching something you were not supposed to. Essie Davis brought the struggling mom to life and gave a great and intense performance. Noah Wiseman also performed well as a young actor. A great horror movie that doesn't just provide cheap scares but also tells a good story with some good cinematography."
" Exorcist Wanna-be?
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,3,"This movie was pretty bad. I know the Mom was supposed to be distraught, but throughout the movie I kept thinking ""Why doesn't she at least comb her hair""? It seems that the Babadook was trying to take over Amelia's personality, which seemed to take hold and then ebb for no apparent reason. I don't know what the ending was supposed to mean. She was feeding the Babadook in the basement? Why was she so calm bringing the food (worms) down to the basement and then become frightened when she got there if she was purposely maintaining the Babadook? I wish that I hadn't wasted my time on this movie."
" This trending movie had a lot more to offer than just a gay icon
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,8,"PROS:To start off, I have literallynever seen a better kid actor. The two main characters were able to deliver a perfect film with no faults in their delivery whatsoever. The actors gave everything you want and then some to their performance, it was quite remarkable.It was so good that it helped the rest of the film tremendously. The characters were able to move along with the build up of tension at the same rate which made the movie progress smoothly. The build up was very terrorizing as well. It was so good that it gave me chills to watch. Something that I look for in movies is how smoothly the transition is from, climax to falling action, and this movie was able to let the viewer simmer on what they just had watched which was nice. The directorwas careful enough to let the development of the falling action carry the last few scenes of the film, this made the resolution of the film more impactful. To continue, the resolution was very well composed. I enjoyed the movie greatly because of the way the ending wrapped up everything nicely.CONS:The one thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was the crazy amounts of plot holes and unanswered questions. To start off, the way the characters changed throughout the film was so bizarre. One minute the mother was sane, then crazy, then sane again; then the son was crazy, then sane, then crazy, then sane, and these transitions happened so abruptly and it caused too much disorganizationfor my liking. Another part that was frustrating was the Babadook himself. I know this might spoil some things in the movie, but the Babadook was quite agonizingto conceptualize. He did real life things like move things, recreate things, make phone calls, inhabit bodies, and all this time the whole point of the Babadook was to be a metaphorfor grief which it didn't deliver. I was torn by the Babadook because it wasn't developed well enough in the film. I know their was a lot of cons, but PLEASE watch this movie! It is so good.www.chorror.com"
" Get outta here ghost!... Job done...
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,7,"I couldn't wait to see this film! Everyone was telling me it was a unique horror film that was full of clever jump scares and had a great concept and original lore to back it up. And, in many ways this was true. The Babadook does contain plenty of those themes, but... like many contemporary horror films it was undone by two recurring themes that hinder it's potential.The first isn't so important if you can back it up okay in the story. It's this idea that the ghost is too powerful to be messed with, you can't beat it, it will always flank you no matter what you do. This can be annoying sometimes, the more powerful the entity the less believable it becomes and the less serious you take it. This can be solved however, IF you have a decent explanation on how to overcome such evil in the plot... enter problematic theme number 2 (SPOILERS).Mr Babadook, what's his undoing? Answer 'telling it to go away'... yeah that's literally what happens. The mother suddenly realises that she loves her son so much that she can tell it where to go... really? Given that decent lore backed up the story, should there not be some more for how to combat it? Maybe portrayed in well thought out cinematographic practice?... No? Too bad.This is a good film , don't get me wrong. It's just hampered by its' predictable unimaginative ending. Aside from that you have a well directed horror film that is bound to give you the shivers to some degree. And well, at least you know that if you ever get haunted all you have to do is tell your ghost to pack his bags and all your problems will be sorted with little effort..."

",2017-07-18 00:00:00,7,"the Movie starts off a bit slow in my own opinion, in the beginning there is mostly drama and no horror but that changes later on. but they build up the drama and horror quite good and mix in a quite a bit psychological fear and elements, such as the struggle of being a single mom who is struggling with the trauma of her dead husband and a quite difficult child and being judged by others and society as a parent. how the moms struggles with difficult emotions and how that blends in with the horror part later in the movie is mixed in a very smart and good way. the horror effects are fantastic.+ the actors. + the the music, sound and visual horror effects (i got goosebumps several times).A bit slow in beginning."
" There's a story there somewhere
",2017-07-07 00:00:00,5,"(Possible spoiler?) My first thoughts when seeing Essie Davis character was ""wow she looks like a worn out piece of crap"". After 10 minutes I was already sick of the vacant stare on her face, that she wears for pretty much most of the film. Whats more, her complete distance from reality even at the beginning made me cringe. Also come on sweetheart, brush your hair?? So I continued to watch as her character predictably became the self- created victim throughout the film. Between the dreadful acting as her ""widow with one- too-many-years without counselling"" and her son's constant over the top tantrums and weirdness, there's probably a plot. As far as the story goes, there's a monster/ghost or something haunting them. It wants to kill them, and she makes it way too easy for it to do so. Had potential but bad acting ruined it"
" A Haunting and Brilliant Unconventional Horror Classic
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,9,"So many modern scary movies follow the same patterns. They introduce a killersometimes a person, sometimes a supernatural beingthen the killer proceeds to wreak havoc on the main characters. Most of the frightening content comes from jump scares and violence. It's all very procedural and drab.The Babadook breaks all the standard conventions. It does so right from the open.Typically in horror films, the opening sequence takes place a night, in an isolated location, with a lone female. She meanders about without a care in the world then boom! The killer strikes. Then the title flashes on screen.The Babadook begins much the same (except the lone female is with her young son rather than being alone). But no killer strikes. A purposefully framed shot lingers on screen, clearly foreshadowing something. Exactly what is not certain. Then the title flashes on screen. Viewers are left furrowing their brows and wondering, ""why that shot? I don't get it."" That's the point. You aren't supposed to understand. Not yet.Unlike most scary movies, it does not immediately make clear who or what the monster is. The monster isn't even introduced until nearly 30 minutes into the movie. It doesn't appear on screen until 20 minutes after that. By movie's end, it remains cloudy what exactly the monster is or if this monster is a real, tangible entity.As an enthusiastic scary movie fan, I cannot express how refreshing it is to see one that respects the audience's intelligence. Nothing is clearly spelled out. The mysterious nature fosters an eerie vibe that builds throughout the story. This causes the viewers to think and wonder, which is a vastly underused technique in scary movies. One of our greatest fears as humans is that of the unknown. This movie plays on that fear.This mysterious style, along with the creepy lifeless color scheme in the house, establish an unsettling tone. Some of the best scary movies ever made opt for tone as the main method of frights over the traditional jump scares. Setting and maintaining a tone takes far more effort and skill, which is why fewer movies choose that route. Appreciate this tactic. You won't often see it executed better.One of my favorite ways to judge the effectiveness of a scary movie is by how it sticks with me after it ends. In this case, I felt as much unease in the two hours following the credits as I did in those preceding them. The Babadook has a haunting brilliance that sticks with you. That's the sign of horror classic."
" The horror of ""The Babadook"" comes from a different place than it appears
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,9,"Horror  especially demons and monsters  as metaphor for psychological trauma isn't a novel idea by any stretch, but Jennifer Kent's ""The Babadook"" is a particularly riveting execution of this concept. Combining modern horror archetypes (e.g. the supernatural, possession, creepy children's things) with emotional family drama, ""The Babadook"" powerfully taps into fears both imagined and painfully real.""The Babadook"" gets under the skin by anchoring its story in the relationship of a single mother, Amelia (Essie Davis), and her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman), whose behavioral challenges are a source of great anxiety for both of them. Samuel is 6 years old and always talking of monsters, building weapons and requiring a lot of his mother's attention. His school wants to pull him out of his class to address his behavior. As a result, Amelia barely sleeps, and compounding matters is that she's still wrestling with the loss of her husband, who died rushing her to the hospital for Samuel to be born.After 20 minutes of solidly establishing the relatable woes of parenthood and how easily misunderstood children are, Samuel pulls an unusual bedtime story off his bookshelf about a boogeyman-type figure named the Babadook who comes to scare children. This only aggravates their sleeping problems, of course, but eventually the book's warnings start to take an eerily real turn.What makes ""The Babadook"" stand out from similar contemporary boogeyman/supernatural horror films is that the child isn't affected nearly as much as the mother. The focal point of the story gradually shifts to Amelia, to the point that we are just as terrified of what she might do as the stress and lack of sleep continues to compound as we are with the Babadook. This shift really takes hold when a new version of the book appears on Amelia's doorstep after she had torn up the pages, this time featuring disturbing new illustrations. Kent does excellent work behind the camera with D.P. Radek Ladczuk using a myriad of techniques including the incorporation of shadow and quick cuts between effectively posed shots to keep the suspense flowing in virtually every scene. The synergy between Kent and Davis is extremely evident as well, and Davis really drives home the roller coaster of emotions (and sanity) her character endures. It's one of the best horror performances in a film of this contemporary style. (She's also strangely reminiscent of Kirsten Dunst, but that's merely an observation.)The connection between the supernatural elements of the Babadook and the ways it represents a manifestation of Amerlia's personal trauma and feelings is kept just tenuous and mysterious enough to work. If the Babadook weren't connected to her psychology at all, the film would feel like any other horror movie; if it were merely in her mind, we would have no reason to be kept in suspense. The balance and relationship between the two  Babadook as a real children's monster and as one's personal demons  keeps the film compelling and ultimately renders it a success.Needless to say, the juicier, more interesting side of that balance is the psychological side. The way the events of the film push mother and child toward a much-needed reckoning gives the movie its savvy and poetic sensibilities. Maybe ""The Babadook"" isn't as scary or thrilling or bloody (definitely no payoff in that regard) as its contemporaries (I'd argue it is, though I'm admittedly not a horror junkie), but the dread it induces from its non-supernatural elements is another kind of terror altogether.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" Outstanding!
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,9,"Just an outstanding movie! I don't really know from where to start. Awesome acting, frightening story, frightening scenes, eerie, plot twisting, announced but unexpected ending, some quite touching drama characteristics, sad storyline, family problems. To put it this way, and amazing mixture of real life struggle with a fictional, scary content.Story is a bit worn our, single mother, boy with special abilities... but trust me, this movie has something special in it. Boy is, by the way, just an amazing character, so smart and innovative, protective, brave... Just amazing . His mother is too. Movie contains a calm a slow beginning, just as wanted in a horror. It has consistent turn for the worse. And yet, it has unexpected turns. It has twists, but fluid story at the same time. Mind games, scary, horrorlike content (voices, dark spots, death scenes, MONSTER)... everything a solid horror needs to have.And the name... I feel in love with it and couldn't stop saying it. Baba-ba dook, doook, doook. My new name for boogieman.Definitely a movie worth watching and if there wasn't few mistakes, it would got a 10 from me. It gave me chills down the spine. And any movie that can make me, even for a second, to be afraid of dark, will make into my favorites."
" Hands down the best gay acceptance film ever.
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,10,"I saw the film exactly one week ago today and not a moment has gone by when I don't ache. It finds me in the shower; it haunts me in bed; it has filled my mind and clings to my thoughts, and it won't let up. I try to lie to myself, to find some solace by saying that it's just a movie, but I know better. The Babadook is alive, and he represents so many aching people, so many untold stories. There is no contrivance, no manufactured importance; there are no tricks. The Babadook tells, with painful honesty and frankness, the story of a gay monster's life and nothing more. Whether you are gay or straight, it doesn't hit close to home: it hits you. The Babadook has a place we all most desperately yearn to go. It's where we can be free. It feels funny to say that The Babadook is my favorite film of all time, because I think it almost an injustice to call it a film at all, or to critique its incredible technical sophistication. Somehow The Babadook transcends that. I could hear a thousand speeches celebrating diversity or read a hundred love stories and not be absolutely broken in just two hours as I was after this film. I've never felt waves of nausea come over me as I did sitting in that theater, my face contorted as I watched truth and honesty spill from the screen and onto moviegoers who had no idea what they were in for. I am usually the first to point out bias, so I know my words might be mistaken for favoritism or blind loyalty. They should not. This movie will change your existence. I find so many things in my life trivial now in the wake of this film---for me, watching it was truly like having a near-death experience. And am I better for it? Yes. Broken and undone, but better. For once in my life, I feel hope, and I've seen the Babadook through all his trials and hardships, accomplishing acceptance."
" Avoid. I wish it was a horror.
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,1,"Drama and horror. Neither of the two make an appearance in this movie.At the time of first seeing the rating of this film on IMDb (6.8), a promising watch was ahead of me. I was very wrong.Poor lighting and dark rooms does not make a scary movie. It is only one tool to set the mood for what is to come and bring emotion to the viewer. Dark rooms and dim lighting was all it had going for itself.The title of the movie is 'The Babadook'. It's confusing as the 'Babadook' does not make an appearance until half way through the movie. It's as if you're watching a movie relating to a woman suffering PTSD or depression rather than the Babadook. The script lacked a great deal of direction. It was as if the writer summarized most scary movies and used most tactics used in those with nothing new. In stead of doing things well in a few scare tactics, it did poorly in many going for quantity instead of quality.Don't get me wrong, i do give praise where it is warranted. Essie Davis' role was done very well.Lastly, the title of the movie is not the most attractive. Other suggestive titles would've been better ie; The Scare Crow, The Shadow, The Terror or even Steve would've been a better name. Do steer well away from this movie.As always, looking out for your mental health and well being"
" One of the Elites of Modern Horror Film
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,9,"The Babadook, masterfully directed by Jennifer Kent is one of the best horror movies of recent years--possibly of recent decades. In her stunning directorial debut, the Australian Kent shows not merely promise as a filmmaker, but the kind of rare talent that seldom shows through this strongly so soon. Creepy, tension filled, and mostly free of tired horror clich矇s, it is something special.The film stars Essie Davis in a terrific emotional turn as Amelia, a widowed mother still years later in a funk of despair over the loss of her husband, in addition to having difficult young child Samuel, played by Noah Wiseman. Samuel talks of dark subjects, makes weapons, and is prone to violent outbursts; he gets suspended from school and causes his devoted-if-emotionally-distant mother barriers with among others her sister and a potential love interest, and society generally. As they become more isolated from society, things get stranger and more distressing in their home, especially when what appears to be a kid's pop-up book, that Amelia can't recall seeing before, called The Babadookthose pages are a terrific artistic creation in themselvesis discovered, and when read is found to be nothing innocent at all. It builds on a spine-chilling atmosphere with events and details, one and then another, very effectively, and hits the viewer with along the way moments of startling fright that add to but never overshadow the main situation. Motivations for certain acts aren't always clear, but that only adds, not detracts, from the overall effect.This is in the running for my favorite horror film since the turn of the century: a genuinely scary film with a great pacing, two strong lead performances, and enough originality to keep it interesting throughout. Beyond all it is Kent, who wrote the film as well as directed it, who deserves large credit for the success.About the same time as this film came out another horror film was released, also by a woman directing her first feature film, and that I think also ranks among the best modern examples of the genre: Ana Lily Amirpour's A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. What Kent and Amirpour prove I think is that if more female talent was given a chance to make the films they are capable of, or the kinds they desire, that many more would shine, and studios are doing a disservice by not considering filmmakers of that gender more often. I can probably count on one hand the number of horror movies since 2000 made by men that I could put alongside either of these two."
" Genuine new horror film
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,8,"I thought this was a great film, although like the 'The Witch' you need to approach this film with a new look at horror style movies. It's a fairly low budget film so don't expect Hollywood dressings. However this film struck me in that it cleverly intertwines several quite complex ideas around a very creepy character...the Babadook.At the end you will not be disappointed with what this film has to offer! I think it deserves an 8 and it's a very fresh understanding of how horror can manifest itself in our lives."
" Never Been More Spooked
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,8,I have never been more spooked in my life. This film is expertly done and made me jump all the time. I love it but at the same time fear it simply because of how horrifying and scary it is. The plot is expertly done just like the whole film and it seems very genuine indeed. Excellent acting on all parts. Well Done!
" A lesson about trauma, mourning and despair.
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,6,"This horror film revolves around the difficult relationship between an imaginative and active son and his mother, a recent widow, both of whom seek to overcome the trauma of a very poorly resolved mourning. From an early moment, we understand the difficulties that the child brings to his mother, both of which are very poorly understood by all those around them. Sooner, the poor mother seems closer to a fit of nerves or deep depression. This finally happens when the character of a children's book (apparently written by herself) begins to take on a life of its own and to terrorize mother and child. The film is a lesson about depression, mourning and trauma. Sometimes, the bogeyman lives within ourselves and its us that we should be afraid of. The scares exist but the tense and terrifying atmosphere is something that is hardly ignored. Concerning actors, Essie Davis is the protagonist and carries the film on her back with great courage, presenting herself without makeup in order to look much more worn, as it requires her character. She is undoubtedly an artist of great talent, capable of embodying difficult characters."
" An extremely chilling film that shook me to the bone
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,9,"I love this film, mainly because of how i relate to the film and how much it terrified me. I saw a lot of myself in the child; I feel that I was like the child in this film. I would set traps for a monster I was convinced existed yet never did. However here it does and it's terrifying. Between this film and The Conjuring I am never owning a house with a basement.This film uses excellent cinematography and sound design to make even the most humble and mundane shots seem terrifying. The constant shrieking of the main boy may annoy some people, or it may add to your level of terror. Either way it really got under my skin in the best way possible.Essie Davis leads this film extremely well, while she does seem to freak out a bit too much in the first act, the rest of the film she is a captivating and terrifying character when she needs to be. She plays the grieving mother extremely well with a good sense that she is hurting and her sons bluntness and overwhelming fear of the Babadook really isn't helping.The ending of the film is really the only part that bugs me. From now on there are major spoilers so be warned. The film ends with us knowing that they are basically caring for the Babadook in the basement. While this subverts expectations and pays off the extended metaphor that the Babadook is their grief, it left me feeling that the main conflict of the film still wasn't solved. The film is also inconsistent about when Amelia (the mother) can and can't see the Babadook, lessening the effects of some scenes.Other than that, the film did an amazing job at terrifying me, and I feel that it showed the right amount of the Babadook. A lot of people disagree but I feel that the good looks we get in the second act really help to imagine what the beast would look like when it came to the climactic showdown between the family and the Babadook.Overall, masterfully writing and directing, phenomenal sound editing and design along with beautiful cinematography lead me to give this film a 9/10. A better ending would have helped me love the film more but as it stands it's a terrifying horror film that I highly recommend checking out. It's out on DVD and Blu Ray, as well as on the UK Netflix and iTunes, and probably other streaming services."
" Interesting, but nothing new
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,6,"You don't need violence and gore to make a horror movie. And Babadook is a fine example.Even though the idea itself is nothing new, I found this movie interesting. Mostly because of the actors who did a really amazing job and greatly contributed to the overall impression of a dark and bleak atmosphere, with their frustration and agony very well depicted. It is a psychological horror story, but only mildly frightening.A few objections are due to the very slow pace of the movie, and due to the fact that some quite important story-related things are left unexplained.Thus, if you exclusively like shocking, bloody, violent jump horrors, then know that this movie isn't for you."
" The Babadook
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,1,"Horror movies are tough. Genre enthusiasts seem to constantly be reminiscing about the old days while new fans are enthralled with what they see, occasionally ignorant to what came before. The Babadook, the 2014 film by Jennifer Kent was heralded by many as the best horror film of 2014. As a horror enthusiast, I was excited to see the ""new take on horror"" that people were calling The Babadook. After my first viewing of The Babadook, I was simply disappointed, the more I thought about the film, however, the more I began to actively dislike it. The film stars Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman as a mother and son team who rely on each other as the only family they have left when suddenly their lives are interrupted by an evil spirit who seeks to possess those it comes into contact with. ""This premise of two people solely reliant upon each other who then have to deal with a possession sounds a bit like Rosemary's Baby,"" I thought to myself, making me even more eager to begin the film. I was wrong--so very wrong, and although I hesitate to say anyone else was wrong who called this a ""new"" horror film, I definitely don't see the hype surrounding it. I found The Babadook to not only be a poor excuse for a horror movie--it really never picks a genre, and that's fine but a film calling itself a horror movie should be, but a poor film altogether. Just add this one to the list of films I don't understand their widespread appeal.Amelia (Essie Davis) is drudging through life as a single mother to her only son after losing her husband in a car accident on the day her son was born on the way to the hospital. Emotional exhaustion and depression has seemed to take over Amelia's life. Despite her dismal existence, she seems content to live in her somber solitude refusing to make plans or leave the house much. Amelia's son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman) is a large part of why they never leave the house; he has managed to ostracize all those around him, including his aunt and cousin with his behavior. Samuel makes weapons and takes them out of the house, he yells and screams, and is odd and unpleasant to be around. Despite his many behavior problems at school, Amelia always takes his side against authorities because Samuel knows exactly when to act affectionate towards his mother, manipulating her at every turn. Once Samuel is kicked out of another school, again, Amelia is at the end of her rope and decides to keep him home for awhile while trying to find another school for him to attend. One night before bed, Amelia reads Samuel a book she has never seen before about a monster. Unsettled after reading such a book, Amelia begins to find traces of the supernatural monster in her home. Initially refusing to believe in a spirit possessing her home, Amelia eventually realizes The Babadook has entered she and her son's lives and is refusing to leave. ""A psychological horror about a single mother who becomes possessed by a monster that wills her to kill her 6-year old son."" That's how The Babadook was described on its own Kickstarter page, that's not what was delivered to the audience, however. I fail to see the psychological horror element of the film, and that is my favorite horror sub-genre. What was psychological was the fact that more than a horror film, The Babadook is a case study on how debilitating PTSD can be. Another struggle I have is that the Babadook is only in half the film. I prefer a director shows rather than tells, so it's not a problem on its own that we rarely see the monster in this film, as long as we are given the atmosphere of the monster. The problem is, instead of a monster's presence being established all we really get is a series of uncomfortable situations that could easily have been the doing of Amelia's out of control child. The Babadook more clearly exists as a family drama showing the deeply engrained problems between a mother and her son. The relationship between Amelia and Samuel is toxic, abusive, and enabling. The two share almost no mutual respect for each other, as they are each entrenched in their own life position to actively participate in the lives of each other. Amelia is run down, as single mothers often are, but to never accept or seek help for her son's defiance is digging her own overwhelmed grave. Despite being heralded as a unique take on horror, there seems to exist little evidence of such. The look of The Babadook appears to be the love child of Nosferatu and Freddy Krueger, so nothing new there. In fact, seeing the Babadook proves to be thoroughly underwhelming. Some horror standbys are utilized such as the fully-clothed bath, the flickering electricity, and the dog being able to ""sense"" the demonic presence in the air. The nursery rhyme score has also run its rounds in the horror genre. The atmosphere said to be created throughout the film appears to borrow from German expressionism, but the bleak colors aren't enough to caputre that style, nor do they add to the atmosphere of the film, they simply make the picture dull. With no character enjoying an arc to their story, without any standout performances, and devoid of any real scares from a largely absent ""monster"", I certainly hope this isn't what horror as a genre has devolved into."
" Time to Reuse That Childhood Night Light

The movie excellently visualizes the internal struggle that Amelia (Essie Davis) deals with on a regular basis, and how that internal struggle presents itself and impacts her son, Samuel (Noah Wiseman), and other members of her community. As the anniversary of his death draws nearer as the film progresses, the viewer begins to understand just how frightening a memory can be and just how detrimental that memory can be to relationships between family and friends. Kent concurrently generates anticipation, suspense and horror as viewers wait to see if Amelia's psychosis can be contained and controlled, or if it will eventually overpower Amelia's freewill and rational thinking and cause her to do things she would not dream of doing. Whatever the result may be, viewers are guaranteed to have trouble falling asleep at night, as the knock of The Babadook resonates in their thoughts: ba Ba-ba DOOK! DOOK! DOOK!"
" You can't get rid of ""The Babadook"".
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"With a name like ""The Babadook"", this film is expected to be a story about an urban legend becoming reality. However, what Jennifer Kent presents is far more than an ordinary, creepy tale. What ""The Babadook"" depicts is the projection of the distressed human mind, of inner fears and despair. These feelings are manifested through a struggling single mother, Amelia, and her six-year-old child, Samuel, who just so happens to be obsessed with learning of his deceased father. His inquisitions become an ongoing burden for the mother, who has never overcome the death of her husband. What we witness is a very realistic scenario of a mother trying to cope with a troublesome child and a young boy trying to grow up with the absence of a father. Both characters find solace in their nightly bedtime stories, until one particular book obstructs their ritual. Kent's tale of a monster that preys on your biggest vulnerabilities goes beyond anything we witness in nightmares. If you've ever experienced sleep paralysis, you will surely identify with Amelia. The monster that haunts her son also torments her, leaving her unable to sleep because closing her eyes means entering a world of constant agony, causing her to be paralyzed by fear. Kent manages to place you in the home of these two characters, making you battle with reality, fantasy, and the subconscious. Through the use of color and lighting you will be transported into the land of the Babadook- a place where only dull colors exist and happiness is unheard of. Kent's continuous use of blue and green hues add to the film's feeling of melancholy and the characters' trance-like state of living. Kent also makes sure to incorporate shadows in the most disturbing of places, playing with your panic of unveiling the Babadook. ""The Babadook"" is labeled as a psychological horror because it truly plays with your perceptions, confronting you with the question of whether the Babadook is real or simply the fragment of an agitated woman's imagination. If you're looking for a horror film that features the typical killing- machine monster, then ""The Babadook"" is not it. However, if you understand the monsters that are capable of forming inside the human mind, you will surely accept Jennifer Kent's directorial debut as a smart, intriguing, yet horrifying film."
" You will Never Feel Terror Quite like The Babadook (Contains Spoilers)
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,10,"The Babadook will not only slowly creep up behind you, steadily intensifying and sending chills up your spine, but it will make you wish you never opened that big red book. The Babadook was one of the most meticulous and well-made films I have seen. The Babadook will not give you cheesy and expected jump scares, instead it will crawl under your bed and you will know its there. The psychological terrors that The Babadook expertly instills into the audience establishes the feeling of true horror. Every child and parent can remember a time when they read a bedtime story, and to think one night you may pick up that large, blood colored book with the title: Mister Babadook and your life will never be the same. Amelia, Sam's mother, had two choices, to ignore the Babadook's existence, or to fight back and stand strong to protect the only family she had left. Like every mother, Amelia brushed off her seemingly disobedient son's crazed stories of this petrifying dark figure; her denial seems to add to the suspense and horror of this film. We as the audience just want to yell out, ""Stop being stupid, listen to Sam!"" The basis of this film invokes very real emotions in the audience. The dark creature embodies Amelia's fear and suffering since her husband's death; as her fear grows, the Babadook gets stronger. The Babadook manifests as Amelia's grief, epitomizing the detrimental repercussions of letting our nightmares control our lives. This sense of verisimilitude taps into the audience's true human fears. Grief is a powerful creature that lives inside each one of us. Just as Amelia tries to repress her grief and sorrow, so do we. However, this film subtly proves that living in denial of our fears is the quickest way to allow them to take over our ability to function. We must face the vicious thoughts that haunt our minds instead of surrendering to our psyche and allowing it to transform into the shape-shifting, black shadow that will take over if you allow it to. The Babadook was an intense and captivating film, showing us that not all monsters are men in masks, but that the real monster can be a figment of our imagination which we fail to control."
" The Babadook Review
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"The film ""The Babadook"" takes an unique twist at horror that may not seem appealing to your every day horror movie thrill seekers. Jennifer Kent tosses away the modern scare tactics like jump scares and horrifying faces and instead gives us a psychological thriller. The film relies on an eerie atmosphere which is created through the use of lighting and shadows, creating darkness, leaving the audience in a constant state of paranoia. What really contributed to this constant paranoia was the effective use of sounds throughout the film. Even when Amelia was reading from the book, we hear this ambient sound which seems like it was used to unnerve the audience, preparing us for fright. From the skittering of the monster along the walls to the absolutely terrifying shriek of BA BA DOOK DOOK, the sounds really leave a chilling impression on the audience. In my opinion, an interesting concept is that the monster seems to be a symbolic reflection on Amelia's depression which increasingly developed as her mental state worsened from taking care of her annoyingly pretentious child. Overall, Jennifer Kent chooses not to scare you with stereotypical creepy images or noises but instead haunts you through the psychological decay of a grieving single mother."
" Grief in women as the boogeyman (SPOILER ALERT)
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,7,"Jennifer Kant's film, The Babadook, is a brilliant film in where you find suspense and inclusively, great sound effects that keep the viewers ""over the edge."" Although the monster looked unrealistic, I find this film to be astounding due to the various ways Kant illustrates in showing the living hell a widow lives in their daily life. For instance, the falling down scenes were a great way to portray her devastation of the car accident in where her husband died. It demonstrates an internal emotion Amelia suffers through from the stress and resentment against her child that is largely built inside of her for years. A great indication to the stress has to be when she has trouble sleeping and it soon transfuses into her child. Additionally, scopophilia is used in a scene in where she is caught staring at a couple making out in the parking lot, which only prompted her fantasies. I imagine it is not a coincidence to learn that Amelia used to write children books in her spare time and a children book that was found in her bookshelf is the result of the appearance of the boogeyman. It is then suggested that the allegory of the boogeyman is the women who are in grief due to the death of their partners. Jennifer Kant used smart tactics throughout the film that showed Amelia's poor mentality and although she spent years trying to portray an image that she was all right. The boogeyman is that ugly part of Amelia that she had tried to bury, but is soon displaced when she kills her pet and made several attempts to do the same to her own child. Throughout the film it is shown an Amelia trying not to get the boogeyman get the best of her and Samuel fighting for his own life. In the final scenes, we are shown that even though she is learning to cope better in life, she will always have the boogeyman around her and the reason she is scared of the monster is because it makes her do terrible things that she would never imagine. This film is so great because it brings to light a topic that many women suffer through and is inclusively hard for others to understand, therefore to create grief as a monster was a brilliant way to show the audience what people live with."
" The Babadook (2014) Movie Review
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Jennifer Kent's The Babadook (2014) is a contemporary horror film that follows the basic structure of a horror film (order, chaos, restoration) yet, it stands out as unique and ""smart film"" by critics. The elements that help the film deliver a unique and very real scare is the verisimilitude, cinematography, and sound within the film. The Babadook brings together the elements of grief, stress, and sleep deprivation our protagonist Amelia (Essie Davis) is going through and embodies them into an ominous entity presented and illustrated in a children's book titled ""Mister Babadook."" After another stressful day and after checking the routinized hiding places Amelia lets her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) choose a bedtime story and picks ""Mister Babadook"" from a variety. As the restless days and nights go by, the subtle nuances of Amelia's real state of mind begin to surface after personally encountering the Babadook. Each episode more and more noticeable.With each scene in the film was carefully pieced together and in an interview with the director Jennifer Kent, David Ehrlich from ""The Dissolve"" Kent said ""I did storyboard"" the film ""starts very centered, everything is framed very centered and composed,"" ""and things start to become more discordant visually."" The mise-en-scene in each shot alludes to Amelia's current state of mind and hints at future events. There are lamps placed near Amelia in certain scenes that portray her character. In the beginning of the film there are two lamps lighting the room up, but the lamp shade next Amelia is clouded compared to the lamp shade next to Samuel. Lastly, both sounds, within the story and part of the scenes, build the tension and create an uncomfortable atmosphere. Also, the ambient sounds, music, and the leitmotif when Amelia is experiencing high stress and anxiety also add another layer of uneasiness. In the scenes when Amelia is flipping through the torn pages of the same book (Mister Babadook) she disposed of herself a couple nights before, the leitmotif is playing throughout as she reads through new found horrors and illustrations of her murdering her son. The Babadook is a unique film that takes a step back from the basic structure of a horror movie and takes a step closer to a more living, contemporary sense of horror. The Babdook is definitely a well written and directed film and deserves more praise than simply being a ""smart film."""
" The Babadook-Spoiler Alert
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,10,"The Babadook-spoiler alert The film The Babadook directed by Jennifer Kent beautifully represents just how seriously the condition of depression can take over our lives. The narrative is laid out to give important details of this single mother's life in the perfect timing to keep the audience involved in what she is going through. Weighed down by the sudden, tragic death of her husband just before delivering her child, Amelia goes about living her life whilst keeping these feelings suppressed. She treats her son, Samuel, in an almost-too- nice sort of fashion, surely trying to ignore the resentment she has for her husband's death. Nothing changes until Mister Babadook enters their life. The story book shows up randomly, perhaps representing a change in the ability for her to contain the depression. The metaphorical use of Mister Babadook perfectly represents her depression boiling over the edge to a point where she has no control. Kent's subtle and simplistic directing adds to the tension creating a building suspension throughout the film. The house along with Amelia's appearance seem to decay as the tension build, showing how Mister Babadook (or her depression) is rapidly taking over. However, Mister Babadook is hardly seen in whole, mostly coming across as simply a sound, or as his disguise which easily looks like a man (likely representing her husband). This could show how the depression is not seen but it's always there, haunting you. Ultimately, Amelia learns to control Mister Babadook keeping him as a sort of ""pet"", and not only suppress her depression but accepts it. Overall this is not a typical gory horror movie, but the haunting psychological effects will stay with you for much longer."
" The Babadook: Not Just Another Monster Under the Bed
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,7,"Jennifer Kent aims to explore the psyche of the anxious in this one of a kind film. While this movie lacks the originality of the ""monster under the bed"" idea, the innovation comes alive when we as an audience realize the monster is created from our minds. The American horror genre traditionally will keep one, and only one, living creature safe: the children. However, the Babadook pushes that norm to its limits. While Sam does not ever actually ever become a victim, the bloody corpse of Sam from Amelia's vivid imagination is real enough. Of course, it is the imagination of the mother, the monstrous feminine, which is the true monster. While the Babadook can put on a funny hat, smile, and pretend everything is normal, the suppression of anxiety can lead to a horrifying creature when the cap is lifted. This is similar to how Jack Nicholson becomes the monster in The Shining (1980). The Babadook can also creep up on us, getting closer and closer if we do not slow down and look around. By the way, the monster can also be created through the lack of sleep as most of us can relate to. This film also throws into question the validity of rationality in regard to the thoughts of the mentally ill. Do we disregard the warnings of the mentally handicapped because of their condition? Or do we consider them to be geniuses because they have such a nontraditional thought process? Most might gravitate towards the former, but Kent might suggest the latter may true as Sam warns his mother many times of the monster Amelia is turning into. I appreciated Kent's suggestion to slow down and take a break from our anxious lives periodically. After all, the best way to get someone to listen is to scare them into doing it."
" The Truest Horror of All
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Many horror films rely on cheap cinematic thrills or attractive actors to get viewers adrenaline going. Jennifer Kent's The Babadook, however, ignores these conventions and instead chooses to rely on nothing but our own inner demons to shock. After the death of her husband, single mother Amelia is seen struggling to deal with the grief of the loss while also raising her son Samuel. By default, Amelia, just like many parents, choose to ignore these emotions, and prioritizes her son instead. When a monster, who is known as the Babadook, starts to follow and play off the family's fears, viewers watch as this unbreakable bond between mother and son is jeprodized - proving to be one of the scariest aspects of the film. The Babadook is intelligent for the fact that it plays on our personal fears of the struggle with loss, a parent's love, and neglecting our mental health and the issues that tend to arise when we are most vulnerable. Many people who have not experienced a major loss in life will likely find it hard to understand or appreciate this film - which is fine, as that is not Kent's intention. The Australian director is smart in the ways she intricately positions the Babadook, a supernatural monster, as a representation of depression and heartbreak. May it be through the use of imagery, color schemes, or tension, we as viewers are given the indication that the Babadook is not the only thing troubling this family - and Kent want us to know this. We are supposed to be rooting for this duo to finally overcome both the physical and internal obstacles in their lives. By the end of the film, it's almost as if we're not scared by the Babadook itself, but more by how a death of a loved one can consume us until we're the unrecognizable monster ourselves - the truest horror of all."
" The Babadook - Under your bed or in your head? (Spoilers)
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Jennifer Kent's, The Babadook (2014), manages to instill a level of horror and psychological terror in its audience that can rival any of the horror film greats while still maintaining its own unique identity and individual style. The Babadook does not rely on cheap jump scares and an onslaught of gore to scare its audience like many modern horror films have done. Rather, it calls upon its monster to provide commentary on mental illness and the psychological impact it can have on not only its sufferers but the people around them as well. Kent's monster on its own would be freaky to have in your house but on screen wouldn't do much to terrorize the majority of audiences, especially avid horror film fans. What makes this movie so terrifying however is what Kent uses her monster to represent. The allegory of the Babadook as Amelia's depression highlights the horror of mental illness. The personification of the disorder allows for it to be looked at in a new, terrifying light. Just like Amelia couldn't prevent the Babadook from entering her home and threatening both her and her son's sanity and safety, she can't prevent her depression from doing the same. From the first hint that the monster might be real, to her chilling confession of ""I'm sick, Sam. I need help"" it is clear that she is not in control of her own thoughts and actions. The monster has gained the upper hand and her depression has taken over her life. Seeing how much the presence of this monster can effect a person and how dangerous they can become because of it is what provides the psychological terror to this movie. A terror that is accentuated further with the chilling discovery at the end that even once to monster appears to have been defeated, it is still there, waiting under the surface, attempting to attack again, demonstrating that mental illness can never truly be defeated."
" It's absolutely worth a watch
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"There are three huge things that made me really enjoy watching this movie, the design, the symbolism and the intelligence of the characters. Most horror movies I do not really like because what we are meant to be afraid of can be entirely lost when the monster shown does not live up to the hype the movie created around it. The only visual of the monster in this movie is through drawings and distorted visuals, we are never shown entirely what the monster is we just know it might take several shapes. I feel not knowing what I am afraid of can add a whole new level of scare, because I'm not sure what it is that is supposed to be scaring me. Another problem some horror movies have is that I stop thinking about it when the movie ends. There really isn't anything more for me to think about in the movie, it's just over now. This problem is fixed here with an interesting level of symbolism, and a lot of the symbolism can be interpreted to be several things. Not entirely knowing what I just watched and having the viewer think of their own meaning and conclusion can add a lot of replay value to this movie. You may think of an entirely different way to think about the movie after watching it for the x amount of times. The third thing I liked was that the main cast were pretty intelligent people, which is basically a long living trope in horror movies that the cast are really dumb and begging to die. I was never annoyed with how situations handled were played out, anything dumb the characters did outside of engaging with the monster is a flaw in their character. Meaning that not everyone is perfect and I feel something when watching each of the characters go through their day. I felt just sad watching the way the characters engage with each other because it is clear that something in their lives is missing, and something in your life is missing if you don't watch this movie."
" Babadook Movie Review
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"**Spoiler Alert!** Warning: Do not watch this movie before bed! Jennifer Kent's The Babadook takes us on an emotional roller-coaster ride of every child's worst nightmare. In her first full- length film, The Babadook, she successfully uses cinematography effects and mise- en-scene to bring a bedtime story to life and illustrate how it consumes the lives of a widow and her son. Amelia Vannick (Essie Davis) can't seem to cope with the loss of her husband after he died in a car accident on the way to hospital to deliver their son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). Depressed and alone, she is left raising her energetic and imaginative son. Before bed one night, Samuel chooses a mysterious new book called ""The Babadook"" for his mother to read to him. After reading a few pages, Amelia realizes this isn't an average children's book. The terrifying illustrations along with the haunting and threatening messages, causes paranoia for both Samuel and his mother. As most legends proceed, the more you don't believe, the stronger and more prominent Mister Babadook becomes. As the movie continues, we are forced to watch the deadly and horrifying toll that Mister Babadook has on Samuel and Amelia's lives. How will they stop Mister Babadook from haunting and brainwashing them before it causes Samuel or Amelia to snap completely? You'll just have to watch Jessica Kent's, The Babadook to find out what Mister Babadook has in store for his latest victims."
" This contains spoilers!!!
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"The Babadook perfectly explores the true horror of grief and all of its ugliness. From the very beginning, the audience is placed in the routine of a mother plagued by the loss of her husband and the needs of a troubled child. The film clashes the issues of Amelia's need to feel loved and how grief does not only effect one person. Samuel feels like an outcast from not having a father, and tries to compensate for the attention by acting out and demand for attention that it pushes the viewer and Amelia off the edge. This interaction of misplaced emotion is the hidden grief personified as the Babadook. Sam is tormented by the Babadook and tries to fight it as Amelia tries to pretend that it does not exist, as most adults do to put on a happy face. The Babadook constantly references underneath because that is where it is festering, to grow and grow until you snap. The snapping point is when you let the anger in, and you become the monster that has cultivated in your head. The mother is literally invaded by the Babadook as she cannot ignore it any longer. Amelia is only able to expel the monster because of Samuel's offering of support and care to let Amelia finally address her own inner demons. But it does not get rid of the Babadook. That is because grief will never go away. You will always know the pain and have these demons in the back of your head, and it is up to you if you let them control you. Amelia takes control and sends the Babadook back underneath where it belongs, but with a cost. Demons require to be feed to stay subdued and calm."
" Spooked by the Babadook
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"SPOILER ALERTS!The psychological horror that is The Babadook captivates the audience with the all too terrifying reality of single-parenthood after losing your spouse. Before the tragic event of losing her husband on the way to the hospital to give birth to their son, Amelia wrote children's books. This is a silent nod of her being the author of The Babadook. Whether she wrote this before or after cannot be confirmed, but it is probable she, in a fit of depression, grief, or rage, wrote the second version that had her killing the dog, her son, and herself. The Babadook is an allegory of her mental illness. Jenifer Kent did a wonderful job representing the horrors of fighting the monsters in our heads, instead of the typical monster movies of fighting the ones under our beds. Mental illness is not always present or a constant problem. It lurks, like the Babadook, in the shadows of your mind (the house), and each person with a mental illness has their own distinct form of one (the different monsters' children ""see"" under the bed). I think the ending, of her feeding the Babadook with worms, is a metaphor of her acknowledging her depression. You normally hear people say, ""I don't want to open that can of worms,"" when referring to something they don't want to discuss. In this case, Amelia has finally recognized she has a mental illness and is trying to get a hold of it. Dealing with mental illness is a constant battle, which is why one can never truly get rid of the Babadook."
" Babadook review
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,7,"SPOILER ALERTIn this film, as in many other horror films, somewhere along the line you realize that the thing to be feared the most is, in fact, your very own fear. Not to say that monsters are not real, however, more to say that they can only exist to the degree that we let them. Knowing this will help you identify the true identity of the Babadook and the extensive metaphorical network that director Jennifer Kent creates throughout the film. From the very first scene of the movie, that is brought to us in the form of a dream and a flashback in one, it becomes obvious what the trauma is that haunts both the mother and son throughout the film, in a literal sense. The trauma that is from the loss of their husband/father. It is the mise en scene that first shows their joint depressions. The absence of color represents the absence of the husband/father and the collective loss of happiness that results. The next part of the metaphor is the sons fear of all of these monsters. The more adamant he becomes about the existence of these monsters (especially the babadook) the more frustrated and irritated the mother becomes. As her depression strengthens throughout the film, so does the Babadook, explaining the true allegory. The reason the mom denied the monsters existence for so long, is actually her denying her depression's existence. Only at the end when the two of them are jointly fighting against her depression (the Babadook) do they succeed in creating a happy life together. This is representative of most people who are dealing with depression needing help from their loved ones in order to establish healthy coping methods. Even after viewing the full film and having time to digest the content, it seems to leave many viewers wondering which parts were real or dreams. This is actually a key part of the metaphor. Depression's effects can be deceptive and exhausting. Certain things can be made very literal or real to depressed people, and the question becomes not, ""what is real?"" but rather, ""what is real to them?"" The Babadook is very real to the two main characters, even at the end of the film. When viewed critically, this metaphor can be extended to every issue and character's objective relating to the plot which is why it is known as a ""smart film."""
" The Monsters in our Head
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"The Babadook is an interesting film that preys on our childhood fears and brings them to life in this dramatic turn of events between a widowed mother, Amelia, and her young son, Samuel. Although it took me two times to watch this film in its entirety, I was able to finally appreciate the psychological and emotional aspect the film was truly about. The pages of a terrifying children's book come alive throughout a series of unsettling events beginning with Amelia's subtle possession by the creepy figure of the narrative, The Babadook, as the intertextuality of the film pays homage to the classic horror film, The Exorcist (William Friedkin, 1973; USA). The utter annoyance of the young boy, Samuel, and the toll his antics has on both Amelia and her obvious depression, keeps you connected to Amelia's exhaustion and annoyance throughout the film. However, once you notice that Samuel's constant concern over The Babadook is a very real fear and that the creature does intend to hurt him and his mother, you are left with a sense of shock that this irritating child was right all along and only wanted to protect Amelia. The cool colors of the film and dark lighting used transports you to a state of watching that makes you feel as dull as how Amelia currently views her life. The Babadook brilliantly uses a typical ""scary monster in the closet"" figure to ultimately symbolically and literally depict how Amelia's depression is consuming her and makes the connection between an actual monster to the monsters in our head. The film simultaneously hints at the fact that if we try to repress these monsters within, it could lead to them growing into larger, powerful, all-consuming entities."
" Once You Let Him In
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"Raw, creepy, and thought-provoking: The Babadook is designed to give the viewer an inside perspective on what depression feels and looks like, and it succeeds. In The Babadook, there is no romanticizing this disease, which is cleverly disguised as Mister Babadook. Jennifer Kent's first feature-length film was not wasted with this incredible picture. Beautiful cinematography and allegorical expression are used brilliantly to cover a subject that is sometimes kept in the basement, under lock and key.We are introduced to Amelia Vannick (Essie Davis) and her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman), and instantaneously, due to the superb mise-en-sc癡ne, it is painfully obvious that this is a tense household. The feelings that are presented through the use of these elements give such believable verisimilitude that it is hard not to imagine yourself in Amelia's situation.This idea of a single mom coping with the antics of a child afraid of ""demons"" isn't the only part of the movie that engages in intertextuality with The Exorcist (1973). There are also images of the bed moving abruptly, as well as the idea of possession. The Babadook, however, keeps it fresh by making a switch from the possession of the child and innocence to possession of the motherly figure.This film is an excellent display of concepts that have been covered in other films many times over, but they're used here in novel and unanticipated ways. The Babadook also brings into the mainstream a disease that affects so many people and is oftentimes kept out of the house, for fear it might overwhelm. Jennifer Kent poses an important question: If we don't address the problems we are facing, will they eventually take us over?"
" Baba-Spook
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,7,"All aboard for the heart-wrenching, tear inducing emotional 嚜選遛嚜選遛ride of the Babadook! A classic Australian family has been done wrong by the sudden death and removal from their lives with of their father and husband. The film., created in 2014 really takes audiences away from the new genre of horror that runs the world of horror, especially past 1990. The use of gore and outrageously uncomfortable situations to instill fear and blood-curling screams from the audience members is not the only way to terrify them anymore. Though, The Babadook, directed by Jennifer Kent, steers itself far from the horror, blood-stained, scream indulging path of the genre itself. Using psychological punches while the emotionally unstable, depressed mother cares, or tries to care for her overly loud, obsessive, needy. attention-deprived father Kent shows us slight glances into the ;ad of the Babadook and how it feeds on the negative feelings of children and doubtful parents. The spooky, imaginable creature-like man feeds on the lives of the despair. so it seems quite coincidental this child's book find itself on their shelf. The storybook character shows his dark, hideous, shadow filled face in the film, creating a possession over he mother who needs some help herself, though not from the child book devil. This possession of his mother leaves the son in terror and confusion throughout the film, until the slightly revealing end. Of course, like any good story book, this film leaves a cliff hanger. Audiences shouldn't prepare to scream, bring an extra pair of underwear, or where a turtleneck to cover your eyes. What audiences should do to prepare for this film? Open your eyes, check under the bed, in the closet, and behind the curtains!"
" When Depression Becomes Your Inner Demon
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,8,"The Babadook takes a unique approach to horror which is why most people do not find the movie good or scary. This film is smart because instead of taking the approach of jump scares or a scary monster, Kent decides to go after pure, terrifying emotions such as grief and depression which make the viewers have a sense of discomfort. The mother in this film is going through an incredibly hard time with not only being reminded of her dead husband around every corner, but also her son struggling in school and being disobedient. Not only was she struggling but her son is also struggling and we see both characters dealing with these emotions which are conveyed through lighting and mise-en- scene. Kent uses a relatively gray color scheme and places multiple objects in the frame to correlate the Babadook to her husband. This connection is important to realize because it is what makes the movie so beautiful and gives it a much deeper meaning. The Babadook is an allegory for the level of her depression and grief, which is expressed non-stop throughout the film throughout the monster's actions. Kent does an incredible job at capturing these emotions and conveying an uncomfortable feeling to the audience. Overall, I think that The Babadook is a revisionist film that is able to make the audience relate to the emotions the mother and son are going through while still encompassing some of the horror elements found in films such as It Follows to an extent."
" Ba-BA-Ba Dook Dook DOOK, The Story of the Bababook
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,10,"There are movies that are loud and upfront with their horror, such as John Carpenter's Halloween. But then there are movies such as Jennifer Kent's The Babadook, that are very subtle about their terror playing off of ideas and concepts that leave a lasting impact hours after the film has ended. This is not meant to bash the wonderful slasher that is Halloween, but instead praises The Babadook for its supreme use of tension and atmosphere to terrify the audience.In this film, Essie Davis plays Amelia, a single mom caring for her young son named Samuel (Noah Wiseman) who is terrified of monsters, while at the same time dealing with her husband's death. One night Samuel picks the book Mister Babadook for Amelia to read, it talks about how the ""Babadook"" comes and scares kids. Both Amelia and Samuel appear to be terrified from the book, this initiates the beginning of their horrifying journey. Jennifer Kent has orchestrated a haunting film that leaves a lasting impressing. From the use of high and low-key lighting to amplify the tension to the brilliant quietness which haunts the film, each and every detail in the film help builds an overwhelming sense of suspense. As a critique, most horror films nowadays tend to overplay their shock factor or ""jump scares"" in their film. While this might be horrifying, it does not leave a lasting impression. The Babadook achieves a perfect balance between horror and terror, leading to an utterly terrifying masterpiece. I give Jennifer Kent's The Babadook a 10/10"
" A Bad Book Indeed
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"It has been a while since a movie has managed to legitimately scare me on some level but the Babadook managed to do just that. Along with its more terrifying aspects of supernatural qualities, it greatly expresses what many people go through when dealing with depression or grief. The allegory of the Mister Babadook book to how bad thought grow and change once they begin to manifest was extremely important as to how this movie shows character development. At the beginning everything is fine with the mother and son but as memories of the mother's husband reemerge, the Babadook enters their lives. Throughout the movie, the mother and son are fighting the Babadook while it is attempting to ruin their lives. He first shows up in the form of a red and black pop-up book that is entirely colored and written with black ink. This black ink begins to be a motif through the movie as it progresses. When the mother rips apart the book, you can see the ink all over her hands. This is the first indication that the Babadook is leeching into her and she can't seem to quite get rid of it. Once the fears of the Babadook die back down, the ink on her hands seems to go away. The black ink comes up later once the mother is untied and ""defeats"" the Babadook for herself by throwing up the black ink and purging herself from the leeching qualities of the Babadook. Lastly it shows up as a black rose at the end which represents how traumatic events can morph into small ""inklings"" *dun-dun-tss* of something beautiful. Overall, this movie shows in a great way how depression evolves, takes over and then leaves."
" Don't Let It In
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,10,"An experience that each one of us can relate to is loss. Jennifer Kent's, The Babadook, forces us to engage in the challenging aftermath after losing a husband and a father years after the accident. The exhausting toll this tragedy has on a widowed, single mother and the isolating development of a hyperactive child in a single parent home creates an immediate, empathetic relationship that has the audience feeling desperately sad and vulnerable. The dark and dull mise-en- scene brings to life the gloomy, melancholy demeanor of Sam and Amelia's home that leave the two characters plagued off from the people who love them most. The draping and dramatic shadows that cover every inch of the house encloses the monster lurking inside, patiently waiting for the right time to attack. I applaud Jennifer Kent for creating such a possessive, haunting, and original type of monster that feeds off our deepest fears. I also want to acknowledge Essie Davis' undeniably brilliant portrayal of Amelia's character development from beginning to end. This psychoanalytical horror divides the audience's perception of what we want to see and what we actually see. The Babadook is not a film filled with gore that will leave you petrified and gasping for air, but the compelling suspense and creepy atmosphere will leave you evaluating what scares you more: the monsters under your bed or the monsters in your head."
" A story of Grief
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,9,"The Babadook is a smart dark modern horror film filled with grief, children, and monsters. This film by Jennifer Kent puts us with a grieving mother and her hyperactive son after their father and husband was killed in a car accident. This film is not your typical monster horror film. Kent presents the Babadook in a way that has you questioning whether it's a real monster or a figment of her imagination. It's a very smart film because of how Kent leaves up to question whether this monster is real or just a manifestation of her grief. The way the Babadook is associated with the mother throughout the book, looming over her, and the mother's slow decent into following what the book prophesized. I believe the Babadook as an allegory to the mother's grief of losing her husband as well as the build up from her hyperactive son getting underneath her skin is a great way to keep the audience guessing all the way up until the end. The camera work along with the music and lighting gives us this sense of perpetual anxiety that this mother goes through every day and that built up can manifest into something as scary as the Babadook or as scary as how she treats her song when she's under its influence. The suppression of the Babadook to the basement can be mapped to her suppressing her grief and keeping it under control in the basement while still feeding it from time to time, sort of how grief works in the real world. Overall the film was a fantastic portrayal emotional trouble along with a strong residual sense of fear after the film is over."
" babadook dook dook
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,7,"If you want a movie to thrill your inner demons you have to look no further than the Babadook. This psychological horror delves into the symbolic spectrum of our innermost monsters brought to life in a transition from outer to inner demons that torment the troubled mother. Can this monster be overcome through love and the will power of the mother is the real question that thrills the viewer throughout this film. This story centers around two characters, Samuel and Amelia, a child and single mother still plagued by the loss of her husband and Samuel's father. The bleak ambient lighting combined with the dull misc-en-scene of the gray lifeless house in which most of the story takes place help the audience to sympathize with the troubled mother and express her grief burdened world. At the same time throughout the film the child's high pitched screams and reckless behavior from his overactive imagination and fear of monsters further agitates the mother's fragile state. With this atmosphere in place the monster created straight from a child's imagination is introduced through a storybook. The monster who only gets stronger the more it is denied torments the little family and the mother especially. The mother becomes through her denial of the monster the monster herself. This psychological transition is seen as her outbursts towards her son's behavior continues to grow in ferocity. This grows and the monster grows as well and allows the viewer to see the parallel and the question again becomes can she overcome that monster."
" It's not about an entity
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,10,"I'm tired of people mistaking this for a regular monster movie. It's NOT about an entity or a scaring creature. *** spoiler ***It's about a mother who hates her own child. The whole fear we see in the movie comes from the imminent danger of her killing her son. But such hate feeling is too terrible for them (mother and son) to acknowledge, so the Babadook is an allegory their minds create to deal with it without addressing it directly.The concept is unusual and the performances are priceless. A really deep deep and strong movie."
" Grief and Terror

Just remember, the more you deny, the stronger he gets."
" Very good chiller about confronting your demons
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,7,"Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10There was a great deal of hype in horror circles surrounding the release of The Babadook. It was called 'revolutionary', a 'masterpiece', and all despite the title bizarrely invoking cheesy 80s novelty party song 'Agadoo' in my mind. Australia is not without any track record of horror films, but nothing of this kind.In terms of type, The Babadook blends gore, jump-scares, creepy chills and oppressive psychological horror, and this is the first impressive aspect. Writer/director Jennifer Kent clearly has a command of all the different tools of the genre. There is great work in music, sound and especially make-up too.Crucially though, it is all in service of the story and the ideas being explored. SOME SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONWARD. Like many such films, The Babadook has a central mystery about whether the terrors stalking the main characters are real or imagined, and ultimately, it doesn't matter. The 'monster' is a metaphor for the demons of depression and anxiety that stalk main character Amelia (Essie Davis), and the danger of her repression of her issues. The message is one that I have seen very rarely elsewhere: the characters win by confronting her demons, acknowledging them, and not defeating them, but instead learning to live with them. That is what impressed me most of all about the film.It's not revolutionary though. I don't think it's a masterpiece either. The kid is not a very good actor, for a start. Besides, there are lots of very good horror films, of which this is only one, and singling it out denies all of them. Watch The Babadook, but watch those films too."
" This is why IMDb should've kept forums
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,3,"This movie was not a horror movie, it's a drag on drama. I learned that on this site and others, that ANYTHING made by IFC or a Netflix original will get high marks no matter if the movie or show is a turd. The pretentious people like to pump up crap like this to feel better about their low self esteem or other underline mental issues. The mother in this movie have NO excuse for not getting her son mental help, since she works with sick people. I have to give the kid props for portraying the most annoying child in a movie.What I've learned over the years of reading these reviews is that if people from the country it's made in don't like it, then I won't either."
" Don't Believe The Hype
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,3,"This is one of those films where you shouldn't believe the hype. After all I'd heard and read about this movie I was really looking forward to it. However, while viewing I soon became aware this was not going to live up to its publicity... and it didn't... it fell woefully short.Here you have a story of a single widowed mother and her peculiar son who are going through life in a stagnant haze. Her son, Samuel (played by Noah Wiseman) is an intelligent child who has a knack for constructing weapons, for which he is reprimanded at school. Samuel is a solitary child who finds it hard to make friends and keep them. He also has a temper that makes him violent, both physically and vocally, when he's confronted.Samuels mother, Amelia (played by Essie Davis) works at a care home and dealing with the close to death cronies has its effect on her. She holds onto the memories of her seven-year dead husband, Oskar, in a proverbial death grip, even her own sister has given up on her. Amelia won't let Samuel have his birthday on the date of his birth as Oskar died driving her to the hospital.Even before the Babadook rears its head, the family is troubled and broken. This should lead to well-rounded and deep characterisations. Instead of this, we get depressed and moody bad parenting from Amelia and shouty stomping belligerence from Samuel. This makes for two very unlikeable characters. If the viewer cannot sympathise, empathise, or in some little way, relate to the main characters then the story and film will not hold their attention... it failed to hold mine... and to be bluntly truthful, I was only watching in the hopes that the Babadook had its evil way with them... I was upset when it didn't.These two characters are both worse than the snot filled blubbering idiot in The Blair Witch Project.The there's the story, which in my eyes, tries to say and be too much. It's not sure if it's horror, there are elements of horror in here, though too little for me to put it in the genre. There's drama with all the elements of relationships in tribulation. The film would've been a lot better if some of these elements had been trimmed back and some removed altogether, and the director chose a direction in which to take the film.So that's what's wrong with the film in my opinion.So what was right?The acting from Essie Davis was pretty good especially, later in the film, when her temperament instantly changes. This sent a chill up and down my spine. Noah Wiseman was brilliant in the son's role. I cannot fault the actors, the fault lies with story and direction, which falls on the head of Jennifer Kent who wrote and directed.That said, apart from the direction of the characters and the story the film was well directed, and at times gave a few chills with prolonged shots of opened wardrobes and corners of rooms, where clothes were hung; the tension created was palpable. So we know that she can direct. Maybe she should've given the story synopsis, which was brilliant and well thought out, over to a writer! I say this as the ending of this movie is why I've placed this into a Dark Fantasy, that and the reason of the Babadook ending up being wimpy (sorry for the spoiler) - this was the biggest let-down of all... a horror movie that tells you there's really nothing to be scared of.I wouldn't recommend anybody watching this film; there's nothing to get out of it. By the end, I was disheartened."
" The terrifying, psychological horror nightmares are made of
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,9,"The Babadook came as a surprise upon viewing it for the first time. Expectations were low considering what footage was available. At a glance, this film can appear low-budget and uninteresting. Perhaps these low expectations can serve the audience well and allow some more enjoyment from this chilling psychological horror. The film centers on a single mother raising her son alone while being haunted by a storybook she reads called Mister Babadook. As the premonitions become more intense, the line between reality and illusion is blurred and confused. The darker and deeper elements of the film involve terrifying representations of mental illness and insanity. As the story progresses, darkness deepens as the character's dark and tragic past is revealed as well as it's horrifying future of murder. In fact, when the mother's terrible forecast of her insane acts are known, it's hard to keep that jaw from dropping. Technically, The Babadook is completely competent and doesn't disappoint with any obvious continuity errors. At times some lighting seems a little too apparent but it's not frequent enough to present any serious issues. Sound effects and editing are woven perfectly into the story to give the viewer a sense of terror and disorientation. Performances were very solid all across the board, particularly from the lead actress whose performance is quite outstanding. Even the boy who plays her son delivers some memorable scenes of scare and terror as he describes his visions of this creature. The imagery of this Babadook creature itself is one that'll stick in the viewer's nightmares.Although the film is genuinely unsettling and skin crawling, some pacing issues keep the frightening concepts at baby possibly too long which can result in more waiting than watching. However, when the guitar strings of tension so to speak to indeed snap, the snap makes all that waiting worth it. Especially during the final thirty minutes when the mother's utter spiral into insanity becomes nauseating. For any fan of psychological horror this film comes highly recommended. It may not be the best horror ever seen but it does rank high in a genre that finds difficulty in effectively delivering deeper scares. It's scary and should shake the core of any viewer. Strong horror like The Babadook is one that definitely shouldn't be missed."
" The absolute best horror movie since The Shining and Silence of the Lambs
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,8,"There is way to much to say about this movie, it was one of the greatest horror movies I've ever seen (The Shining still remains my favorite). The first thing I'm gonna talk about here is the lighting; this is the greatest lighting you will ever see in a movie. It makes EVERY SINGLE SCENE terrifying. Even the scenes when nothing was happening, and the mom and her son are just sitting there. You have the most unsettling feeling watching this movie, and I think that about 60% of the reason this movie was so horrifying was the lighting.The Camera Work: This is some of the best camera-work I've ever seen in a movie. Just like the lighting, it gives you this terrible feeling like you know something is going to happen. The camera-work in this movie I think is some of the best, I would say maybe the fifth best I've seen (behind Gravity, La La Land, Saving Private Ryan,and The Shining). The Acting: The acting in this movie was pretty good, I liked the child actor, he did a great job portraying an annoying b*tchy kid, but you could understand what he was going through. The lead actress does an amazing job actually, and I personally think she deserved to have been nominated for Best Actress in the 2014 Academy Awards. She wouldn't have won because the Academy doesn't like Horror, Action, or Sci-fi movies for the important awards (excluding Silence of the Lambs). The leading character almost reminded me of Jack from The Shining, you're just slowly watching this character descend into madness, but unlike the Shining, there is a resolution in the end. The Story: I really enjoyed this story, like I said, you're kind of watching our lead character slowly go mad from the evil presence that haunts her. It's more than just the modern day clich矇 horror movie that all have the same plot. The plot of those movies are: A creepy kid does something creepy, the relative of the kid tries to help, the demon attacks the person, they get rid of the demon, the end. That is not what this movie is at all, it's way darker, way scarier, and doesn't rely completely on jump scares to carry the movie to the finish. Every modern horror movie except this and It Follows relies on jump scares. Lights Out, Annabelle, all Paranormal Activity sequels after the first one. They're all the same. The Babadook does something different and new, and I feel like not enough people saw this amazing movie. Critical Acclaim: It's rating on Rotten Tomatoes is 98%, Metascore is 86, it won 46 awards. IMDb decided to give it a 6.8/10, and that is criminal. That is the lowest rating of a movie I enjoyed so much. IMDb needs to give good movies a better rating (The Revenant, Zero Dark Thirty, Gravity, any Wes Anderson film, The Babadook)."
" More Horr-ible - than Horror
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,1,"This movie feels like a whole bunch of graduating film students, armed with their folders of ""film theory"", decided it would be a good idea to make a feature film out of a short film. Bad idea. *this review may contain spoilers*This is the first horror film I've seen that is depressing. Depressing! If I wanted to see a bleak, psychologically unhinged film with way too many metaphors, I would have picked something else. I read such great reviews all over the net I thought I would buy it and settle in for a night of scares. pfft! my grandmother is scarier than this film.It feels like we come in halfway through the setup. A seriously annoying and badly behaved kid and a mother already strung out and at wit's end. It doesn't endear empathy - I spent the first half hour being annoyed AT the film for all the caterwauling and shrillness. I did not empathise with the characters. Don't blink or you'll miss the reason - a one line explanation of what happened six years ago. There was no recent catalyst that triggered off the forthcoming events, no explanation of why they would find the book at this time, it just... 'happened'. Dreary, miserable, slow, predictable and overly symbolic with no relief. If you wanted to study this film in a course, it ticks all the boxes to endlessly psychoanalise the mind of the mother about whether it is real or some sort of delayed PTSD manifesting as the ""the monster in the closet"". I understand why they chose the set design to be washed out and shadowy but it didn't change with any action either - there was no high contrast in the scenes outside of the house as to inside the house. No sense of The real world vs the internal struggle. It was just all dull and draining to watch. and the dog. really? gratuitous and unnecessary. I was looking forward to this film but as an entertainingly good horror movie - I didn't expect I'd have to 'read' it. The Babadook failed to impress on either a horror or macabre level.Not even bad enough to be good."
" The Babadook is real
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,6,"This is a movie I've wanted to see since it came out as it looked to be a fresh take on horror. In the trailers, the Babadook struck me as a terrifying new bogeyman sprung from some collective children's nightmare or the frightened child in us all. The first act of the film is great. It's got the spooky, misunderstood kid, the stressed out single mom barely holding it together and a sickening sense of their household inexorably slipping into the supernatural. The best scenes are where the mother reads from the mysterious children's book to her son about the Babadook and quickly realizes that she has unwittingly (or perhaps not so unwittingly) let a demonic force into their lives. The book itself is a delightfully dark and fiendishly clever creation, and one thinks, a building block for a Freddy-type franchise. (In fact, I would rate the book 10 stars, the movie 5.) But then the movie turns inward and the mother becomes possessed by the Babadook, so for a long stretch we no longer see the entity. Instead we see the mother in the grips of possession. While this makes sense psychologically, watching someone being controlled by a demonic force is depressingly familiar territory. And watching a once-loving mother act abusively towards her small child is not only monotonous, it's not my idea of entertainment. The arty, ambiguous ending provides a lot of food for thought, though it will undoubtedly disappoint hardcore horror fans.There's a lot of talk on the message board about whether the Babadook is indeed real or whether it's all in the mother and child's heads. There are good arguments on both sides, but I do believe it's real, if for no other reason than there's a lot of money to be made in potential Babadook sequels."
" Not bad
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,8,"Surely, Samuel is a child with special needs. But the school does not understand inclusive education. So he has to find another school.Surely Babadook has no understanding of inclusion either. It bullies the poor child and his poor single mum, who is already disadvantaged and experiencing middle-age crisis, by haunting them and making their miserable life even more unbearable. Come on! Babadook, can't you find somebody else to haunt? :)For me, the first half of the movie is great. The problem lies in the second half. I would have liked to see a dark ending. It would have been wonderful to have Babadook-possessed mum kill Samuel and then herself, and let the demon's book pass on to another family. The dark prophecy in the book of Babadook would be fulfilled. Instead, the mother and son defeated the monster, and a happy ending is what we get. This happy ending is just not as interesting.Perhaps, the filmmaker wanted to make a politically correct horror movie, to draw attention to the socially disadvantaged families? But as a horror movie, it needs to be dark and depressing. It should have taken a darker route.Not as good as I thought it would be. But not bad, either. The acting, the atmosphere... everything was well done. I only expected to see a dark horror movie like Sinister.So far, Sinister remains the best horror movie in English. That movie has a dark creepy ending."
" I can't believe I waited so long to watch this
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,8,"CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS CONTAINS SPOILERS I put off watching this due to how many bad reviews I saw and how many people I came across that had nothing to say about it other than to mock it. But I finally sat down to watch it while answering some emails and quickly found the emails completely forgotten.This isn't a jump and scare type of horror, and I personally found the times the Babadook was crawling around a bit funny. If you base the movie off of him alone it looks like another sorta bad sorta funny horror. The children's book was scarily adorable and I want it, and I've found myself walking around the house saying, 'Ba ba dook dook dook,' all night.That all alone made it an okay movie. But what made it good was every other bit. The way he lurks in the shadows always had you nervous every time there was a dark corner. The way the little boy annoys the hell out of you at first then wins you over with how pathetic he is. It nearly broke my heart when he was trying to tell his mommy he was hungry and there was no food in the fridge. The way friends and family react to them is so uncomfortable and just really gets you into the story. The mother takes every idea of depression you can have and plays them beautifully. The real story and the real horror is the relationship between them and the lows it reaches at times. I feel like they could have gone more into detail with certain bits, like the home visit that ended so quickly. The ending had a bit of a twist but still left you uneasy and rather sad for everyone the entire time.Well worth the watch even if the dinosaur noises were a bit distracting."
" A sigh of terror among several disappointments
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"In a century where few horror movies stand out, we have ""Babadook,"" the film that tells the story of Amelia (Essie Davis), a single mother who creates a troublesome son by herself, causing depression, anguish, and anger. With sections reminiscent of Repulsa (64) and the Enlightened One (80), ""Babadook"" is a script show, all the characters are absurdly well built, and it looks like the movie only has an hour and a half. For many moments we forget the supernatural, because what terrifies us is the life of Amelia, and the film becomes so human that when the supernatural comes, we really get scared, a story where the human aspect of the characters are very well built in the Making me forget the supernatural and mystery, we can say that it is a script that Stephen King would approve, I confess that I went to watch the film for a recommendation of a friend, and with a certain prejudice, but the photograph of the film won me completely in the first 5 minutes, This extremely dark photograph with a palette of colors turned to gray, from the first minute something in the film bothers you, with a precise soundtrack and brilliant performances, Essie Davis is frighteningly perfect, and Noah Wiseman makes you believe in his madness only with You look at it. The big mistake of the movie is his third act, all of it is a sin, in trying to fight against the bad he relieves himself and puts himself at the level of all other mediums for bad horror films. Of course the film has a message, it's all an allegory, the monster is much deeper than just a monster, it's all an analogy behind involving depression and madness, but the movie that has its first two great acts, And a third dumb and simple that normalizes and disappoints, but it is worth very much, although the film is no longer genius due to sheer lack of imagination, the script is given to the common in the last minutes. But lastly, ""Babadook"" is worth it, because it is mostly different, and for lovers of terror, it is a delight."
