" the king and the queen
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,6,"French actress and film director Maïwenn already has a rather interesting biography that could be the subject of a film in the future. Until this happens (or not) each of her appearances in front of or behind the camera arouses interest and causes heated discussions. Maïwenn is not and I don't think she's even trying to be a consensus-seeking personality, and the movie 'Mon Roi' is no exception. It is her first feature film in which Maïwenn is limited to being 'only' the film director, entrusting the lead roles to a couple of outstanding actors, Vincent Cassel and Emmanuelle Bercot. Bercot actually won an acting award at Cannes for this role. There are many things that I liked in this film, there are some that impressed me less, but 'Mon Roi' did not leave me indifferent at any time during the over two hours of screening.Lawyer Tony and the owner of restaurant Giorgio live a tumultuous love story that lasts ten years, a story that we follow from the first meeting to the possible end through flashbacks that take place in memory of the heroine after a ski accident that immobilizes her for a few months, possibly suicide attempt or maybe testing of limits. It is a romantic story that seems doomed to failure for everyone except those who live it directly, a relationship and a marriage in which there is love but not happiness, an asymmetrical relationship in which the woman repeatedly falls under the fascination of the man who seems to accumulate all male vices possible - infidelity, drugs, material instability. The waters seem to calm down in a rather ambiguous ending, but we can't be sure that the story is really over.The main quality of the film in my opinion is the exceptional interpretation of the two lead roles. The method used by the director Maïwenn defines the main lines of the roles and the place where the story ends in each scene, but does not establish precisely the gestures or the lines, leaving to the actors a great freedom of expression. Emmanuelle Bercot and Vincent Cassel fully involve themselves in using this freedom, immersing themselves in the roles of two people who love each other to the point of mutual destruction. The acting performances are even more remarkable considering that the actors were forced to improvise at times because the script did not offer many additional references. For example, Tony's intellectual dimension is not highlighted at all in contrast to the sparkling but empty world of the celebrities in which Giorgio seems to be happy. The route of Tony's physical and mental recovery in the sanatorium follows a schematic and idealized path, and the final scene seems to cancel out a large part of the effects built during the rest of the story. 'Mon Roi' is an interesting film, which gets attention especially because of the quality and intensity of the performances of the two actors. More attention to detail and less schematism in defining the sub-plots and supporting characters would have made the difference between an interesting film like 'Mon Roi' and a very good one."
" More than merely watchable, but...
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this story of a tempestuous love relationship with its ups and downs.
There's a couple of things that get me, though. First, I get that French and American attitudes toward work are different, ie, work for many French is viewed as less central to one's life than it is for many Americans. Still, with this much chaos in the couple's personal lives, it's hard to see how the lawyer wife is so successful in her career. As for the husband, I know there are rogues that manage to both be well-off and one inch ahead of the law. Still, beside mention of a restaurant ownership at the beginning, where does all the money come from?
Second, again on this topic of occupation and just IMHO, the wife didn't seem to have the mind or bearing of a highly successful lawyer. I got no sense of any deep intellectual acuity or curiosity. I got the feeling they wanted to make her the epitome of the smart, successful woman, so they chose that profession. But why not marketing or something more plausible?"
" The whole truth about love
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,A real female look at a man. Do not take your eyes off the main character
" Keep learning from this movie
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"If people do not repair their inner defects, do not rationally observe and manage their own behavior pattern, just follow the instinct to make choices, a lot of times will make the decision to drink poison to quench thirst, and continue to repeat the mistakes, until there is no retreat. Fix yourself. Identify the right people. Do the right thing. These three things may not be done in a lifetime for many people."
" Heartwarming and heartbreaking
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,7,"An excellent film dealing with the complex concept of couple and the vision of each of the two protagonists about love, with their own pasts, their hypothetical skeletons in the closet, their desires, their doubts, their regrets, their professional issues, ... and the faculty of idealizing the partner, ephemerally or perennially.The actors Vincent Cassel and Emmanuelle Bercot are fabulous. Georgio is charming and highly sensitive. Tony is fundamentally under his spell and blindly idealizes him. We feel a connection apparently sincere and real between them, with an obvious alchemy. A constructive alchemy first, a little less afterwards. And the director Maïwenn produces an excellent film and demonstrates her undeniable qualities, after the unforgettable Polisse (2011) and its 13 nominations during the César 2012.As a synthesis: a French must see. 7/8 of 10"
" The fast approach romance, fades away slowly.
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,7,"I knew it was a romance film, but totally unexpected what I just saw. It was different, that's all, other than that there are many similar films that were already made. The film's focus was not the characters, but the phases and the pace of a romance. The love at the beginning and the same love at some time in the latter. The differences what the film highlights. But it's impossible without the characters and their perspectives. So, from the beginning to the end, how a romance can evolve, how it influences other around, all the fun, crazy stuffs, is the film.The film was partially inspired by the director's own married life. Nice casting and performances. I felt like there was no depth in narration. Depth means, you can't understand the characters fully. Everything it lets you know are the events from where the film begins. So basically it is all about the romance and nothing else. Not even their professions, or the friends and any side incidents, except those topics were used in places in a small quantity to fill the void and make a clean flow of the story. The whole two hours is like about an insane romance. Again, that part divides into two, the first half of the film and the next half.In the first half, it's all about the initiation. Girl meets boy, instantly fall in love with each other and do crazy things to build the character. It seems like any romantic film, but it all necessarily designed to manage what follows in the later part. Apart from the two who are well positioned from their professional level, it looked kind of like a rich guy meets an economically average girl. Then entering his world, and beginning to taste the royal lifestyle, as well as a sweet romance. The story was mainly told from the woman's perspective. The narration had double layer, going back and returning to present, the two timeline story was revealed to us.❝I prefer not to be in love and not get hurt.❞The woman seems intentionally met with an accident in the opening, and she begins to remember her recent past. Her unexpected crazy romance with a rich playboy. While recovering from the knee injury, she makes some friends and they all help each other to come out of their struggle. On the other side of the narration, revealed everything she went through. Not just a happy love story, but struggles over the time pass by. Having a child, being parents, the life drastically changes for both of them. Yet their love and care for each other remains somewhere in the deep of their hearts. Then there is a life, every moment is unpredictable. So how it ends was not that I surprised, because of its realistic.At one point, I thought it could be the French 'The Notebook'. It did not have emotional end. I'm not saying about sad or happy ending, but the film was honest to the real world. How the second half turned out was the excellent twist in the narration, but done with slowly. This was about the people in their late 30s or 40s. That makes the film is mainly for middled aged people. Otherwise, if the characters and their generation were brought down to like the 20s, the film would have been totally another level. And would have had a more target audience. That's what most of the Hollywood films focus on these days.The same film in Hollywood would have been one of the frontrunner for the Oscars. The performances were really great. Particularly Emmanuelle Bercot was awesome. As usual, Vincent Cassel showed his class, proved why he's one of the top stars in France. I thought two hours was a bit long, but the writing was good, they had filled the film nicely with the events that helped further to grow stronger in the following scenes.Despite I consider it a nice film, I don't think everybody would enjoy. They might like it at the end, enjoy watching is not that comes along. Because it is not an entertainment film, nor an art. As I said before, realistic about the relationship and its maturity in the modern world. The other options for the relationship, despite putting all the efforts to save it like people did in the previous century. So, all I say is choose it wisely.7/10"
" The greatest misfortune, the montage
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,3,"The movie itself is not good. Get tired too fast. You see quickly what the problem is going to be. It will be because we have seen it many times, but seeing characters so extreme you know that from one end goes to the next and not surprising.The actors are very well, that can not be denied. They are all very well.There are times when you even laugh at the graces Cassel makes. Even knowing that such a character will go to the other end. The problem is that the first thing you think about is because Bercot does not realize it.What has taken me most out of the film is the montage it has. It is becoming fashionable non-linear assembly, but for me in this case, does not let you get to empathize with the characters in the good times and also let you suffer with them in the bad, because throughout the film You have been seeing the end and the beginning. Apart from being too long the friendly part.It has a very French photograph, white bone, it does not count anything. Let the script alone be the most important. It seems that they do not know that the cinema is composed of several stages.The management, manages to create a close couple, yes, but only that. He gets bored at times and does not see that it is long. He also does not know how to narrate with the camera.I do not understand that you want the last sequence or that I'm too rational"
" Beautiful, a masterpiece
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,10,"Witful and touching. Great dialogues arising sensitivity and emotion played by an admirable acting team. At the same time full of humour and damn tragic. An intense mix telling a truly believable story. We continuously feel saddened and amazed, which is what the movie maker wanted, I guess, since she must have felt the same way in reality. D"
