" A cute gift to star wars fans
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,8,Compare this to episode 8 and 9 and its a masterpiece...i hope the people shredding this are doing the same to the last jedi as that is a disgrace of a film. This film obviously repeats the plot of a new hope but it is charming and well acted and full of hope and light and love for the originals. The next film however is the opposite. 1 gem in the trilogy.
" Failed to live up to the promise
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,3,"I was looking forward to it coming out, and despite JJ ruining Star Trek I had hope that maybe, just maybe, he'd do a better job with Star Wars. There were a few standout moments but other than that, to me it felt like just a rehash with nothing new.Long story short I would not recommend this film - stick with the core trilogy - it's infinitely better."
" The beginning of a new trilogy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,The first movie of the 3rd and final trilogy includes Han Solo getting killed by his son Kylo Ren!!!!!!!!!
" Dis-gus-ting
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,2,"Complete and utter lack of dignity for all involved. No integrity. No respect. No self-awareness.Absolutely no care for Star Wars.Millions have enjoyed and respected Star Wars and this crew shows up and destroys it for cash. They are all harlots.Not one of them said 'look, let me be honest with myself I cannot act. I know it.Mommy is kind, but she is my mother after all. i know the truth' or 'look, the only reason I am here is because I am a woman and it is the cliched era of gender switches/I am black and it is the cliched era of affirmative action/I am a fat East Asian and they want rarity displayed on screen' None of them said I cannot act/I cannot direct/I am poor and I should respect Star Wars, art and the fans and not do this. They all showed up.And I am not letting Luke or George Lucas off either. Greed.This film should never have been. It is the worst cloned remake ever saddled with all the cliches of the new century.
I will change my name if anyone involved with this makes it in the industry."
" Reboot of the original
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,6,"Just a reboot of the original story. Oh the death star is replaced with something bigger but nothing that great. I like the character Rey but that is about it. No real imagination to this. Physics also take a back seat, and just dont matter. The death stars replacement shoots an energy beam that not only travels faster than light, but suddenly splits into several beams each one targeting and destroying it's own star system. Each system light years from one another. Oh and if you can somehow justify this idiotic weapon. You can not explain how the light transmitted by the destruction that results from its use, instantaneously travels it's way across hundreds of light years to those who whiteness it. Just laziness!"
" Nothing makes sense
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,3,"Instead of using the comic books or the Legends universe, they decided to do a completely new story that makes zero sense by itself and with the past films. I still don't understand how suddenly, after the Rebels win against the Empire, there is suddenly a new empire. They don't explain what happened to transition from a victory to being back to an empire. The First Order makes no sense, Rey's ""natural"" knowledge with a lightsaber makes no sense, Luke's disappearance makes no sense, nothing makes sense. I love the casting choice, and I think that the actors did what they could with the material they were given. Not their fault that the writing of their characters sucks."
" Disney destroys a great story once again
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,1,This is the beginning of the worst trilogy in the star wars legacy! None of these films should have been made. The actors and actresses were terrible in their performance.
" Actually great Star Wars film!
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,8,"I do not understand the hate this movie has received. The critics are great. This is, very simply, a great movie. Very well-made."
" What is the most embarrassing thing in the world?
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,2,"Having a subscription to Disney+ of course.This 'product' is so inferior and tacky that it boggles the mind.
Hollywood: who you know not what you know."
" Not Star Wars
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,5,"We need to talk about the gap between Episode VI and this one. It's like they have any connections. I mean, why are they still rebels, if they won at the last one??
It's also not original, looks like a recycling of the original story. Same rebels, same empire, same jedi that gives up because one padawan gives up to the dark side of the force. There's nothing new here."
" Worse than the Prequels? YOU BET!
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,3,"I'm giving episode VII three stars only so I can give episodes VIII and IX fewer. However, this one was actually the best of the three sequels. If you love the original Star Wars trilogy and were able to tolerate the three prequels (less Jar-Jar), then you will absolutely despise the three sequels. Bad writing, bad storyline, mostly bad acting, woke, agenda-driven casting, very good cinematography/special effects. Many parts of the storyline seem to be rehashed and divergent, reimagined storylines from the original movies. With the exception of Carrie Fisher, the original cast that make appearances, steal all the scenes. The original casting really was magic in a bottle that could never be duplicated. With that said, it's a shame that Carrie Fisher led such a rough life and didn't take better care of herself. It was clear in her scenes that it had taken a toll on her. I often found myself distracted by her appearance, voice and mannerisms during her scenes. I could go on and on about all the issues I have with these movies but what's the point? Bottom line, they stink."
" Highest Budget Dumpster Ever
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,2,"Just awful. If you liked Star Wars....you'll hate this. If you hated Star Wars...you'll rub your hands in glee sith style. Because it's just bad, no redeeming qualities whatsoever..."
" Just a cash in
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,1,No creativity. Doesn't push the story of Star Wars forward. Just copies previous movies for a cash in. A waste of time
" New age garbage
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,1,Well they managed to make a character worse than jar jar binks. Kylo ren is to Star Wars what nickleback is to music. Absolute rubbish. Such a shame the final trilogy is ruined by a spoilt child Whose only place in the film is to get angry and upset because he doesn't get his own way. Kylo ren aka the worst thing to ever come from the Star Wars universe
" It is Disney Woke Wars!!
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,1,"Don't any hope to see a meaningful star wars movie again.
Bye Bye.. Disney and Starwars... We Are not ready to give you our money to watch craps stories about how we think or talk.
Take your woke agenda from my pockets."
" Good...But Not That Much...
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,8,"When I saw this movie for the first time I was actually Happy with it, but then, when I repaired that people were angry at it I was also angry. What do I want to say with this? People expectations for this movie were too high and that gave this movie an unfair rate.Hope you understand my point!😊"
" A good start with some hurdles.
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,"The Force Awakens the first of the new trilogy was pretty enjoyable. Great cast, great sound and visuals. Having a movie that kind of retreads old ground is a problem I have but the characters do help carry it alongDaisy Ridley and Jon Boyega really shine and really work well along some familiar faces from the past. With the acting being superbOn ly problem is as mentioned before is the retreading and also the story as a whole, while the ending did leave me excited to see whats next the journey to get there felt a little rushed, never hanging around in places long enough to get invested int he worlds and environments.This is a nit pick but I wish they put as much investment into the worlds and story as they did the fantastic job of the characters.The movie is still enjoyable and really helps introduce a new generation to the franchise even if it does retread old ground to get there."
" Very Very Safe
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,6,Utilising a predominantly repurposed story from the original movies what we get is a visually pleasing film that really doesn't do much new narratively. It also throws a lot of ideas at the audience trying to discover which ones will stick in order to carry a trilogy but does not succeed as a self contained story in its own right.
" You Know What Is More Shocking Than How Boring This Remake Is??
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,2,That the actor and actress (loosely meant of course) Marey Sue and Finn showed up and gave interviews and thought they are hot stuff now. They are not only untalented but also blind. Anyone could have looked in the mirror or looked at their own footage and seen what a no-talent disaster they are.And you know who I blame more than the bean counting cheap hos JJ Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy? George Lucas and his love of cash.
" Star Wars Haters Make A 'Star Wars' Movie (Shame on George Lucas For Taking The $$)
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,3,This is where it starts getting very badThe Force Awakens is the first 'Star Wars' movie that I encountered which was a terrible and forgettable film. Not much really happens that is new or interesting and I think the whole Mary Sue can do anything is just stupid and could not be much worse. There are a lot of times where it feels like Mary Sue is just some hallucination or just some amateur kid who happens to hold a 'laser sword' that after awhile gets boring and tedious. Really not a good sequel/remake to Star Wars.
" SAY NO
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,2,Really bad script coupled with really bad actors and actresses in a really bad gender switch film.Shame Star Wars (RIP) deserved better.
" Unfortunate
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,2,A remake of A New Hope with terrible character believability. For me this is now the worst movie. Phantom Menace moves up a notch.
" It looks good.
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,5,"-Hey let's make a new star wars movie
-Ok.
-Lets make it stupid, and all the measurements wrong.
-But..
-Shhh!"
" ma_REY Sue
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,2,"What a Ma-REY Sue... completely out of nowhere she sails into the seas of money making and franchising and overpowers everybody not caring or listening to anything we know about the force, jedi or Yoda.
Just disrobe and shut up please, OK?"
" Feels like an unimaginative fan fiction written by an impressionable teenager
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,5,"Let me start by saying that there are some awesome parts of this movie: the actors are great, the score is amazing, virtual effects and pretty much every practical aspect of this film hits the spot.And this movie only goes to prove that none of this matters when you don't have a good story.The entire script feels like a teenager writing herself and her friends into A New Hope, as Rey, and the rest of the new cast respectively. ""Oh wow, here I am flying with Han Solo on a Millenium Falcon that I boarded on a desert planet just like Luke! And here we are easily beating every enemy we encounter because we are so cool and awesome. Weeeee""Watch it only to enjoy the visuals and the audio. Don't expect a good movie"
" 7.9??? Look At The Reviews it should be 1.9!
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,2,"Say NO to this and other gender switchesThis was such a boring cliché with terrible accounting-driven sequel-ish directing and really tacky actors and actresses. Look, I am a man so if you gender switch at least get the girl to show some skin and have long feminine hair or do something!Anything! Star Wars was destroyed by this stupid reboot.Boycott Disney+ or be laughed at"
" terrible
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,1,Terrible. like the other 2. disney has ruined Star Wars
" BOYCOT!!!!!!!
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,2,"Boycott the so-called director, the producer and the cast.
Definitely boycott Disney+These sabotuers need to be taught a lesson.How dare they mock Star Wars? How dare they lie to us just so easily that is a new episode??
How dare these joke 'actors' discuss Star Wars like they have a clue or they care?A clone stormtrooper that does not look like his original version???An untrained Mary Sue who cannot afford a tent to live in but flies the Milleniun Factor better than Solo?The rebels are acting as if they didn't win in Episode VI????A darth vader groupie who doesn't need a mas but occasionally wears one! For fun? Is he mocking darth vader who needed one for medical reasons??YOU ARE TACKY AND CHEAP IF YOU SUBSCRIBED TO DISNEY+"
" it wasn't the best but still decent
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,7,I watched this in the cinema on release thought it was decent but just a bit slow
" A strong start for this era of 'Star Wars'.
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,8,"An enjoyable beginning to the sequel trilogy!'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' entertained me. It felt like a fresh direction for the overall franchise, which I guess is little surprise given George Lucas was not a major part of this. I actually didn't notice a great deal of difference, or at least as much as I thought there'd be given his exclusion.I enjoyed seeing the new cast merge with the old trio, even if there are only small appearances from two of the latter. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are excellent additions, both give top performances - I will say I didn't sense major chemistry between the two, but I assume that'll come soon enough. Adam Driver, meanwhile, suits his role nicely.Original trio Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill all feature, though - as alluded to - Ford is the only one that has a major part to play. Either way, it's cool seeing them back in the franchise.Everything else about the film satisfied me, I'm not saying it's perfect - esp. the plot - but I found it perfectly fun to watch. For me, it's a strong start for this era of 'Star Wars'."
" No words
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,2,"I knew I should not watch this. After I disliked Episodes 1,2,3 I was still hoping that maybe only Episodes about times before Luke's adventures are bad? But episodes after Luke's adventures are much, much worse...
That Kylo Ren is not Darth Vader, and the characters put significant efforts to show that they are frightened by him. That efforts are written on their faces like they are doing powerlifting.
I liked Rey though, just because she has perfect face and it's a pleasure to see her.
Apart from that, there is no real plot and no friends and no love, and I even cannot remember what it was about..."
" Bad
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,1,"This movie makes no sense as a sequel.
They tried to extend on a chapter that is already closed and making things worse in the progress."
" Great start to the new trilogy
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,7,"As a Star Wars fan and as a realist, I expected this new trilogy to not meet expectations. Like any Star Wars movie if you can look past the occasional plot hole and logical fallacy this is a great movie. It gave me all the elements to satisfy my nostalgia while bringing in new characters and storylines to keep me interested."
" A Strong Return
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,"10 years since the last Episode of the Star Wars saga, fans counted down the days until the release of the 'Force Awakens' bringing us the next adventure for the Jedi and the Republic. Most exciting about the drop of Episode 7, is the new characters, questions over their involvement in the Galaxy. Filming, which began in 2014, saw scenes taken place in Iceland and Abu Dhabi, before being wrapped in November of that year. Impressive about the new film, is the theatrical release poster, picturing characters old and new, colour and action, gravitating people to the movie. The hit film begins thirty years after the Galactic Civil War, the First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to eliminate the Mew Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by General Leia Organa, opposes the First Order. Leia searches for her brother, Luke Skywalker, who has gone missing. On the desert planet of Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, played by Oscar Isaac, receives a map to Luke's location from Lor San Tekka. Poe Dameron, is cleverly characterised, his heart is on his sleeve and his leadership skills are evident, there is no doubt of cheekiness and confidence in his work, making him so reliant and comfortable to be around. Stormtroopers play a significant role in the opening scene, but in the saga altogether, their intimating, cloned features make their in-sync movements rather satisfying, when they march, it is almost like a parade of soldiers. Their armour is made up of only black and white, covering their whole body. Stormtroopers carry the nickname ""bucket-heads"" and - after the Battle of Endor - Remnant Stormtroopers, were the elite shock troops of the Galactic Empire. The troopers were fanatically loyal to the Empire, making it impossible for them to betray the Imperial cause. Their signature armour partners the E-11 blaster rifle, proving at times more defensive than offensive. The white armoured soldiers commanded by First Order leader Kylo Ren, raid the village and capture Poe, who was acting suspicious whilst watching the destruction of his planet, Kylo kills San Tekka. Poe's unique, round droid, BB-8, escapes with the map and encounters a scavenger named Rey. Our first impressions on Rey is that she is independent, fierce and tired of living her difficult life, working for very little in return. She at first is reluctant to the droid, but is encouraged to go with it, in the quest to find Luke Skywalker, a man who she's heard about many times. Kylo Ren tortures Poe using the Force and learns of BB-8. Ren is portrayed as a dark, evil villain, who is supposedly the main to Revive the work previously carried out by the Empire. The character, performed by Adam Driver, sees the American actor execute his mental struggles and anger to perfection, as we see numerously, when something doesn't go to plan, it usual ends up with him beating a room with his fire, lightsaber. Stormtrooper FN-2187 is seen at the war zone in Jakku with blood on his helmet, following the death of one of his fellow troopers, this singled him out from the others, focusing the viewers attention on that one trooper, he seemed out of place and uncomfortable in the law of the First Order, reinforced when he looks around at the fire and conflict, questioning his life choices. The Stormtrooper is captured taking his helmet off, a rarity in the saga, his face overwhelmed by what he has witnessed. Disillusioned by the First Order, he frees Poe, and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter, after Poe confesses his Piloting skills. A worrying start eventually sees the pair leave the First Order's ship. Upon learning that FN-2187 has no other name, Poe gives him the name ""Finn"". As the two become quite the partners, with Dameron piloting and Finn on the shooting system, they head to Jakku to retrieve BB-8, much to Finn's disagreement. Their TIE fighter is shot down by a First Order Star Destroyer and crash-land. Finn survives, turning to see the ship in flames in the middle of the desert, assuming that Poe died in the crash. Finn, wearing Poe's jacket, comes across Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an air strike. Rey, Finn, and BB-8 steal the prestigious Millenium Falcon, parked unattended and escape the planet. The Millennium Falcon features as an iconic starship throughout the Star Wars franchise. The idea came from a George Lucas seeing a half-eaten sandwich and an olive on someone's plate very close together, Lucas thinking that would make a good starship design. The powerful starship is best bragged about for its speed and efficiency, many characters mention to the ship's owner Han, that it completed the Kessel Run in under 15 parsecs, which he corrects by stating it was under 12. Other connotations to the amazement is how complicated it is, we see many times damage to it, difficulties with the hyperdrive and at times, a delay before travelling at light speed, backing up Leia's famous line: ""You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought"". It's distinctive shape offers a small height, allowing it to fit into tight spaces thanks to its flexibility. The first 'originals appearance' comes from Han and Chewy, in a tense scene, the ship seems to be discovered, only to be boarded by Han Solo and his Wookie partner, ""Chewy we're home"". Gangs seeking to settle debts with Han attack profusely, but the group escape in the Falcon. At the First Order's Starkiller Base, a planet converted into a superweapon, Supreme Leader Snoke allows General Hux to use the weapon for the first time. The pair just mentioned share the same wicked ambitions to dominate the Galaxy, Snoke an ancient, wrinkled creature who sits tall watching the First Order carry out their business. Hux is a straight-forward man, says things as they are, his harsh tone when speaking enforces his power and want to succeed. Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions relating to his father, Han Solo, who Kylo states means nothing to him. The significance of Ren being the son of Leia and Han, begs the question why he turned to the dark side of the force, very little has changed about Han and Leia regarding their characteristics but their son's betrayal to the dark side, could cause potential mental insecurity to the couple, however, we are yet to see any physiological struggle from Han or Leia. Aboard the Falcon, Han determines that BB-8's map is incomplete. He then explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the Dark Side, destroyed the temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travels to the planet Takodana and meets with cantina owner Maz Kanata, who offers assistance getting BB-8 to the Resistance. Rey is drawn by the Force to a secluded vault, presenting the strong sense of the Force within her, she finds the iconic lightsaber once belonging to Luke and his father, Anakin Skywalker. She experiences disturbing visions and flees into the woods, confused and terrified. Max gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping - a key transition in the film, and the saga. Starkiller Base destroys the New Republic and its fleet. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of BB-8. The droid plays such an underrated key role in the film and the job of peacemakers, taking the light off C-3PO and R2-D2. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by the resistance X-Wing fighters led by the very much alive Poe, who survived the crash. Leia arrives at Takodana with C-3PO and reunites with Han. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. It is clear that the two are very similar, they have an unrequited connection and we are unsure why. Snoke orders Kylo to bring Rey to him. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes using a Jedi mind trick on a guard. At the Resistance base on D'Qar, BB-8 finds R2-D2, who had been inactive since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire once more, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking the main facility. In a similar predicament to 'A New Hope' with the Death Star. Using the Falcon, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey and plant explosives. Han, in a tense scene, confronts his son Kylo Ren, and implores him to abandon the Dark side, much to Leia's encouragement. With the roles reversed from Luke's confrontation with Lord Vader. Kylo seems to consider this, but ultimately refuses and kills his father, highlighting his brutality, leaving a very angry Wookie who watches from above. Chewbacca - devastated - shoots Kylo Ren and sets off the explosives, allowing Poe to attack and destroy the base's thermal oscillator. The injured Kylo pursues Finn and Rey into the woods. Finn uses the safekeeping lightsaber to ensue combat with Ren. Kylo's lightsaber is especially unique, it appears to be infiltrated with flames and is structured in the design of a sword. The battle is so Finn can distract the villain and protect Rey, before Ren knocks him unconscious. Rey takes the lightsaber and channels the Force to defeat Kylo in a duel. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley (Finn and Rey) were both fairly unknown at the time, both English, despite Boyega performing with an American accent, the two resemble the attributes and acting qualities seem from Ewan McGregor and Mark Hamill in past episodes. The pair during their battle are separated by a fissure as the planet surface begins to splinter. The snow covered forest sets the perfect scene for the battle. However, Snoke orders Hux to Eva hate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Chewbacca rescues Rey and the unconscious Finn, and they escape aboard the Falcon. As the resistance forces flee, Starkiller Base implodes. On D'Qar, Leia, Rey and Chewbacca mourn the death of Han, knowing they had lost a great man. R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which Rey uses to find the oceanic planet Ahch-To in"
" Set pieces designed by Vincente Minnelli
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,3,"Okay, it has the touchstones of Luke and Chewbacca, the Falcon, a few glimpses of Leia, but the story is a rehash of every trope that this franchise has covered multiple times before; nothing fresh. And the sets? That red room battle? I was waiting for Nanette Fabray to wheel out in a wagon singing ""Louisiana Hoedown"".Disney...As the all powerful Yogurt said, ""Moichandising! Moichandising! Moichandising!"""
" Good but Bad
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,6,"The plot was well written as an storyline but the execution was flawed. Although reoccurrences of father/child and droids-with-secrets themes tried to bring past storyline successes into fold.Fin and Poe were absolutely terrible characters and if that wasn't bad enough, their acting was atrocious - Fin's in particular who seemed to flourish on idiotic and breathless dialog - and I don't mean good - I mean deep labored breathing in and out. Neither were needed in this movie but was so obvious attempts for inducing political correctness, it became a joke. Good sense would have left Rey being the only main new good-guy character. Even the new droid - as cute as it is - seems patronizing in its attempt to introduce something new.The best thing in the movie was Adam Driver who is incredible and warranted the headline new villain role. Great panorama and of course CGI is in great balance and doesn't go over-the-top but helped to absorb the atrocious dialog - especially from unnecessary characters."
" A nice start...!
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,8,"This movie is very special, it gave the fans the hope again to watch a nice movie.J.J. Abrams makes a very good job creating and establishing this new era, the characters and the plot.The biggest problem of the movie is it's repetitive plot, it's the same structure as A New Hope, but it works and creates for the fans a lot of expectation for the next film. The movie creates lots of questions and creates hype, that's something the movie does very good.It's also a very good entertainment product, you're always in trouble and there's always action. The VFX are incredible and the score by John Williams makes the movie epic.
The characters are great and the actors also, and the direction is very, very good, it was shot on 35mm and you feel it. The Cinematography is also beautiful, it gives an artistic style to the movie that other Star Wars movies haven't.In conclusion, it's a very solid starting for a promising trilogy."
" What the hell happened
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,1,"Star Wars used to be good but now it is predictable, lazy writing and introduce all these new boring characters with no development. Han has the most screen time out of the 3 but then he gets killed off, Luke is in the movie for like 2 seconds and Leia doesn't come till like halfway through the movie and she is barely and Rey is just boring to watch and Kylo is just annoying and a repeat of Darth Vader but fails to actually be interesting. Shame on you Star Wars."
" An epic achievement
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!When I first saw this film, I was delirious with joy. It was all so good! Seeing Han and Chewie back aboard the Falcon, Leia still kicking evil ass across the galaxy, stormtroopers! X-Wings! That score! And even better, I felt like director and co-screenwriter Abrams, along with his fellow screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Michal Arndt, had seen what needed to be done, and done it well; pass the torch from one generation to the next.Kylo Ren (best new character of the series) is literally the next generation as the son of Han and Leia, but it's more than that; Rey is following in Luke's footsteps in learning about the Force, while Han comes to respect her as someone who could join his crew. Finn is breaking free of his conditioning, and learning how to become who he really is. There's a new droid to take up the C-3PO/R2-D2 mantle. I was struck too by the choice to make so many of the First Order officers so visibly young; this is a galaxy on the point of transition. The events we saw in the first movies are fading from memory, and are even believed by some of the characters to be myths. It's time for a new set of heroes and villains to take the stage, to forge the galaxy anew.
That the older characters, like Han and Leia, (and it's hinted, Luke) are struggling with the mistakes of their own past makes so much sense. It reinforces the cyclical nature of things. Every generation shapes the world as they want it to be before becoming old and lamenting what they didn't do, even as a new generation is reshaping the world anew. (That this was happening behind the scenes as Disney took over Lucasfilm, and this was the first Star Wars film not directed and/or written by George Lucas must have occurred to Abrams and co. too.) In this cyclical view of things, it even makes wonderful sense that a new planet-killing threat is arising that looks suspiciously like the one from the Episode IV.Making this trilogy a handing over of the torch was necessary but to embrace it with such verve, and give us such fantastic characters was a fantastic, heart-enlarging achievement.
Bravo!Yes, I had some quibbles; Rey gets to powerful force user mighty quick, the silliness of the ""No, that was the Death Star, this is BIGGER"", Domhnall Gleeson (who I usually love) hamming it up too hard, but overall the joy, excitement, and wonder I felt knocked those niggles aside.I recall the moment in the cinema when I realised that Rey was going to find Luke but that the movie was also about to end and I was like ""Nooooooooooo!!!! I need more!"" but it left the sequels in such a good place, with so much to explore.I have to admit that, on re-watch, some of that joy is dimmed by knowing what came later. Rian Johnson admirably took the baton he had been given, and pushed the characters and story onwards, before (and this is the disappointment I am referring to), Abrams came back with The Rise of Skywalker and reversed all that Johnson had done, squandering the new developments and potential he had been left, and even reversing some of the new generation thrust of this movie.But it's likely not right to let subsequent movies impact on one's enjoyment. This movie remains a ton of fun with great characters, exciting sequences, a thrilling story, huge heart, and bright shining hope for the future."
" People who don't watch Star Wars love this movie. I did until I watched the Mandalorian and animated shows
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,2,"When this movie came out in 2015 I enjoyed it. I didn't know anything really about the story of Star Wars and how rich the history and storytelling is. However the Mandalorian changed all of that. Once season 2 came out, I knew I had to rewatch all of the prequels, OG trilogy, and watch the Clone Wars and Rebels - all in chronological order. What a masterpiece of a story George Lucas and Dave Filoni have told, with the help of John Favreau. The characters are well written, and the only really downfall is maybe the dialogue of the prequels. But the acting is great, the new characters of the clone wars, rebels, and Mando are tasteful and add to the story.I couldn't get even 20 minutes into rewatching this movie. The story awful from the crawl: even Mark Hamill himself disagrees with Sequel Luke as Luke would never go into hiding. And with the story that Mando is telling, Luke is not the last Jedi like the opening crawl claims. The acting is what really did me in though. I absolutely cannot stand Fin. His character is over the top obnoxious and it feels like John Boyega is trying too hard. Not to mention that John has even admitted Fin serves no purpose but to be a token black character. Po's character is eh but the ""comedy"" in this movie is awful and forced.This movie even ends on a low note. Someone who's never fought with a light saber defeats a sith lord who's been trained by Snoke, who really is Palpatine. Rey doesn't have a character arc, JJ just made her this all powerful being who can wield the force with no training. She then finds Luke, the beacon of hope who threw his light saber away in the face of Palpatine, who actually went into hiding because he *thought* ben solo would turn to the dark side and tried to kill him.Long story short the sequels, starting with this movie that set them up to fail, have destroyed the characters we all know and love, while bringing in new character with shallow character arcs and almost no purpose"
" The best entry in the saga since 1980
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,8,"Luke Skywalker has vanished. The First Order and the Resistance race to locate the map to his whereabouts.
Let me start by saying this, yes it borrows a lot from 'A New Hope' for example the new 'First Order' are basically a new 'Empire' and the Resistance are the new 'Rebellion', but that does not make it a bad film. This takes Star Wars back to what made it so successful in the first place.I say this without any hyperbole, Kylo Ren is the most interesting character in the entire saga, he's not the complete villain, he's broken and completely conflicted. Crafting a villain who is trying to live up to Darth Vader was a master stroke as it straight away eliminates the 'he's no Vader' argument, because that's the whole point. Adam Driver's performance is magnetic, he brings the presence and physicality needed for an intimidating villain and then when that helmet comes off, he's just a boy, being torn apart inside.The new trio of heroes breathe life into a franchise in desperate need of energy and genuine connection after the wooden prequels. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a brilliant discovery, she plays a self sufficient orphan scavenger on the desert planet of Jakku who is waiting desperately for her parents to return. Other newcomers Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) bring great energy to the film, Poe is essentially a new twist on Han Solo, a cocky fighter pilot and it works well. Finn however is a character of the likes we have never seen before, an ex stormtrooper who has fled the first order, this was an incredibly interesting angle to take. BB-8 is a worthy successor to R2-D2.The returning cast do very well, Han Solo ( Harrison Ford) is a very integral part of the story as he retrieves his beloved Millenium Falcon from Rey and Finn before being dragged back into the fight against The First Order's Starkiller Base (a very big Death Star). Han is not the same anymore though, he's lost a bit of his swagger, as has the now General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), something has happened to them that has torn them apart. The less said about Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the better, for now.This is of course 'The Skywalker Saga' and despite much pre-release speculation about Rey being the descendant of Luke or Han & Leia, the mysterious new Emperor like figure Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) reveals that Kylo Ren is the son of Han Solo & Leia, and therefore the grandson of Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker, it all makes sense.New characters such as Snoke, Captain Phasma & General Hux, don't have too much to do, but there is enough to keep viewers intrigued about the future.The best scene in the entire film comes towards its end, in which Han Solo confronts his son Kylo Ren, who we now learn is named Ben Solo, on a bridge of the Starkiller Base. This scene is incredible, it's develops Han Solo in a way we've never seen before and it further proves that Kylo Ren is the most interesting character since Anakin. The back and forth between the two is incredibly emotional and ends with a conflicted Kylo Ren slaughtering his father, the most heartbreaking thing about this scene is the huge scream that Chewbacca let's put as he watches his best friend die at the hands of his son.The lightsaber action, like most other elements of this film, goes back to the same style of the original trilogy. Finn is quickly defeated but Rey, with her new found force sensitivity, is able to defeat the injured Kylo Ren, but the ground breaks beneath them.The film closes with a literally cliff hanger, Rey finds Luke Skywalker on the planet of Ach-to and holds out the Skywalker saber, the credits rollJJ Abrams brought Star Wars back to its best, and there was reason for fans to be hopeful."
" Better to not watch
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,1,Forget the last three movies happened they have really uninteresting characters and ruin our loved characters in the star wars franchise. Really bad writing.
" Worst eposode so far
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,2,"New episode that actualy is bad remake?
Main character is grender changed, and we have political correctness so afroamerican actor as one of main characters (but still no Mexicans as main characters - they also have big pipulation in USA, so not enough political correct). And all 3 new actors/ress act so bad. Rebels are still rebels, and dark force have mass destruction weapon again for third time, also again parents and kids are on diferent sides... Old saga is being destroyed by Disney because director dont have inspiration."
" A New Hope Remake
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,5,This Movie's writing team is Not creative and i doubt that they even watch all SW movies.This is a carbon copy of ANH and not good as a New hope. Finn like a interesting character but in the end of this Trilogy we know He is useless.Rey and Kylo fight scene is soooo bad i mean rey is a scavenger in beginning but in The end She won against Kylo..So lame and make no sense..Jokes are not funny.How can Rey become Jedi without education?

" It's Been Decades Since ROTJ, Finally The Force Has Awakened.
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,8,"The Force Awakens is to me, the best film of 2015. This film takes place 30 years after ROTJ. In Awakens, we are introduced to new characters, with the original trilogy cast. The Force Awakens is similar to A New Hope in plot. Rey( Daisy Ridley), is a scavenger from the planet Jakku. Rey survives by scavenging what she can to afford food. I her spare time she continues to count down the days until her parents return. She doesn't realize that she has Jedi powers, all she is aware of is the fight for survival. While on Jakku, she runs into an ex-storm trooper, Finn ( John Boydega). He crash lands on Jakku along with Poe( Oscar Isaacs) who he believes has perished. When Poe's droid realizes Finn has his jacket, Rey confronts him. They soon become fast friends when they find out the New Order is after them. The reason, BB8 is carrying a piece of map to the location of Luke SkyWalker ( Mark Hamill).The 3 of them escape on The Falcon, with that vital piece installed in BB8. Rey is amazing handling The Falcon, she flies it like she owns it. BB8 is a wonderful addition, along with Finn. He can't tell her the truth at first, so he tells her he is with the Resistance. When they think they are free and clear of the First Order, they get boarded by Han Solo Ship. Solo is shocked when he finds out they are the only crew members. He is also impressed by how well Rey can handle herself, and how Finn took care of Chewbacca. Han gets to know the trio, and begins to tell Rey about his adventures. He goes on about Luke Skywalker, how he helped him take down both Death Star's, and defeated Darth Vader. Rey always thought Luke was a Myth. Then Han tells Rey why Luke went into exile. It was due to one of his apprentices turning on him. That apprentice, Kylo Ren( Adam Driver). Kylo, is Han and General Leia's( Carry Fisher) son; Ben Solo. Rey begins to tell Han that she has to get the droid, BB8, to D'Qar. So the whole map can be completed.First Han makes a stop to the planet, Takodana. They meet Maz Kanata( Lupita Juaun). She owns a cantina, she gives them more info about Luke's whereabouts, & discovers Finn is not who he says he is. Once there Maz and Rey journey to the bottom of the cantina, where Rey finds Luke's light saber. Maz explains it's origins and tells her about the Jedi. When Rey holds it, it opens up past memories of Luke @ Cloud City. Rey is scared and doesn't want any part of this power, even though she can feel the force flow through her. She is so upset, she runs and eventually gets captured by Kylo Ren. She is taken to StarKiller Base, which is much like a Death Star, but deadlier. When Finn finds out what happens, he tells Han. They need to go to D'Qar, to devise a plan. Once there, Han meets Leia, Finn tells them who he really is and why he left, and he meets up with Poe. When BB8 finds R2( Kenny Baker) the rest of the map is there, with BB8's piece the map is complete.C-3PO ( Daniels) has a small but effect part. A plan to save Rey and try to get Ben back begins.Once on Starkiller Base, the planet is cold and the weapon is built inside the planet. Kylo Ren and Rey confront each other, this is where they test their Jedi power on each other. Kylo leaves to see the Supreme Leader Snoke. Rey tests her Jedi powers on a Storm Trooper, and escapes. Kylo tells Snoke about Rey, & General Hux(Gleeson) and they believe Rey could be a big threat. Snoke tells Ren to bring her back to him. When Ren finds out she has escaped, he goes after her.
In the meantime, Han and company arrive on the base. There plan is to blow up StarKiller Base, before it is able to fire again Finn, Han, Chewie, and Rey find each other, but run into Capt. Phasma. Later Han and Ren confront each other. Ren can feel the lightside of the force, and is conflicted by this. Just when you think the two make a connection Ken kills is father with his light saber. When Chewie sees this it sets off the explosives. This allows Poe and the Rebellion to attack the base. While the planet is becoming unstable Kylo and Rey have the ultimate duel. She beats him and get the coordinates to the location of Luke Skywalker; Skywalker is on the planet Ahto-To . When she finds him on Ahch-To she hands him his light saber.In Conclusion, I liked this film. There is lots of action and it's so much better than those early 2000's prequels. Still, nothing will be the original trilogy, EVER."
" Re-reviewing
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,7,"I used to give this movie a 9 because it was (in my opinion) one of the best Star Wars movies in the sequel trilogy, probably the only best. It brought me back as a Star Wars fan since it has been years since a Star Wars movie came out, it was similar to A New Hope but in a different take which could have potential for the next sequels.The reason I lower it because of the sequels. I can point out flaws The Force Awakens has and still enjoyed the movie, but The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker pretty much damaged of actually good storytelling with adding new ideas which never lays or come out good, a nostalgia fest to keep fans at bay, and questions that were never answered which lead to more questions (I know The Force Awakens is guilty of this too.)Don't get me wrong, I still like this movie but it is now part of the reasons why Star Wars is ruined with its own 5 decade legacy by Disney. I can accepted it canon now, but as a fan, I don't see it that way anymore."
" why are they trying?
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,1,"This the worst movie of the star wars movies. first if you have to kill Han Solo don't do it like that. that is pathetic.
the movie us so long for what it adds to the story. all you did is make a character introduction for 2 hours.
it's trying to be something it's not. trying to make another great villan? he can't even weald his light saber right and he got defeated by a girl with no training? I get she is overpowered but still deosn't make an excuse for defeating a sith apprentise.
Rey is overpowered. nothing else needed to add here.
worst film of star wars"
" Visually stunning, but thematically underwhelming
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,6,"When I first saw ""The Force Awakens"" (TFA) in theatres back in 2015, I left the cinema feeling cold. Nothing in the movie particularly impressed me except its visuals, and Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren. As a whole, I felt cold toward the movie, almost as if it was purposefully keeping me at arms length. However, I was excited to see future installments, specifically to see more of Kylo Ren. It's now 2021, and all three films of the new trilogy have been released, effectively completing the Skywalker saga; it's six years later, and yet I still find myself feeling the exact same way about this movie.I've rewatched TFA a handful of times since seeing it in December of 2015, and each time I wonder if my opinion on the film will change. Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case. First things first: Kylo Ren is still my personal favorite part about this movie. Adam Driver's stellar performance as a conflicted villain who so desperately wants to turn off his moral barometer to turn to the Dark Side makes this movie rewatchable for me. He's an incredible actor, and we never really had a villain with this much depth in any Star Wars movie in the past. There are so many riveting character moments, such as Kylo's conversation with his father, or the climactic lightsaber duel where Kylo hits himself to gain power from his pain. He is truly the most fleshed out character in this movie, and the one who you'll desperately want to know more about when the movie ends.Daisy Ridley is good as Rey, and is definitely entertaining to watch on screen. Say what you want about how her connection with the force is handled, and how powerful she seems to be right at the start of her adventure, Daisy still takes her material and elevates it, becoming a hero that you will be rooting for. Her chemistry with John Boyega's character, Finn, is also marvelous. John Boyega is fantastic as Finn, and the scenes with him and Daisy are a joy to watch, full of comedy that lands and romance that buds (or does it?).Visually, the film looks good, as you'd expect. J. J. Abrams did a nice job with the overall look of the film - you'll see sandy vistas, exciting space ship flights, and intense aerial combat, all of which looks great, which is no surprise coming from the film's $300 million budget. TFA is also full of action scenes and set-pieces, all of which are easy to follow and, again, look good. However, this leads me into some of my negatives.Besides the final lightsaber duel that I mentioned earlier, I didn't find any action set-piece especially memorable. All of it looks good, perhaps to a fault, because, while it is easy to follow, devoid of shaky cam or quick editing, it's just kind of boring. There were no risks taken whatsoever when it comes to TFA's action sequences, and I have no doubt that was an intentional decision made for mass audience appeal. It just feels too safe, and as a result, too bland. Additionally, there are so many action scenes that happen, resulting in a scene practically every 15 minutes, which makes the movie feel so rushed that there is barely anytime to breathe. And because of that, you don't get much personal time to spend with the new characters that have been introduced, resulting in a barrage of action scenes that ultimately lead to the next action scene - rinse and repeat until the end of the movie.TFA is a movie I want to love, but I simply can't. I do love Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren, but that simply isn't enough for me to rate this movie any higher than a 6 out of 10, which is right about average for me. It's a fast-paced, entertaining enough film, but nothing about it crossed the line for me to take it from average to extraordinary."
" Liar Liar Pants On Fire
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,2,"They call it Episode VII, but it is a clone of Episode IV... they lied to you in your face.JJ Abrams, Iger, George Lucas, Kathleen Kennedy and the drama school actors and actresses... they are all liars Gender switch vomit.Shame on anyone who pays Disney. How tacky."
" This movie reveals what Hollywood has become since the original series
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,2,"I don't love the ""prequal"" films Lucas created for Star Wars, but at least they feel like attempts at adding to the Star Wars story. This movie felt like a cookie-cutter, formulaic attempt at dropping recycled plot and dialog references from the original trilogy, in order to play on Star Wars fans nostalgia, while shoving it all into the modern Hollywood package of non-stop manufactured suspense, drama and induced emotional responses. It's basically Titanic or Pearl Harbor, set to a Star Wars theme. I appreciate the attempt at recreating the magic of the original film, where Lucas cast a series of previously unknown actors, and ended up creating something special, with a couple of the actors going on to have pretty remarkable film careers (most notably Harrison Ford). However, we'll never actually know whether they're good actors, because they were all shoved into a pretty tight mold and required to follow a very conservative script that is typical of modern day Hollywood. The ""evil"" factor was also dialed up on the villains to where we now have what appears to be a barely pubescent version of Darth Vader torturing captives and... well, I don't want to give away key parts of the plot for those who still want to watch it, although I don't really recommend doing so."
" People are hating on this movie and that's not justified at all
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,9,"I get it that people can hate on The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker, but hating one as much is just not fair.The only problems I have with this movie are that The First Order is a copy of the Empire and that it's origin is never explain. Another problem I have is that the 5 planets get destroyed without any repercussions.Aside from those problems I actually really love this movie. Snoke, Rey's origin, Kylo Ren, The mystery around Luke, it's all amazing to me. Until The Last Jedi destroyed all of that, that is."
" 'The Force Awakens' brings Fresh Energy to the Franchise, Even If It Focuses Too Much On The Past
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,8,"TFA was the 1st live action SW film I saw in theaters. As a lifelong SW fan since birth, Episode VII nailed the atmosphere and heart of the franchise. This movie blew my mind and gave me not only respect to what cinema-going experiences could be but respect towards practical effects and filmmaking. People hate on this film because it is follows similar beats and parallels to 'A New Hope' (sorry, it isn't an exact retread). But I absolutely LOVE this movie. The dialogue feels like the original trilogy and each line and set piece is memorable.
Years later, I can still watch this movie and even though the trilogy might not have ended the way we all expected, I can't take away the fact that is a WELL DONE MOVIE. I have issues with it for sure, it ain't perfect. I feel going to Maz Kanata's castle slows the pace and there might be TOO MANY callbacks that just begin to make you eye-roll in places. But at the end of the day THIS FILM WORKS. It's good and definitely gave me hope for what the future of the franchise could be."
" The Fault in our Star Wars, why TFA played it too safe.
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,4,"'The Force Awakens' starts off strong, introducing us to characters (Rey, Finn, Poe and Kylo) in their natural environments, building up links to the past, but in a way that works very well, and through this first arc I think we truly get the best half an hour of solid story telling out of the three films. Rey is introduced as a scrappy scavenger orphan, lost on a baron world that connects us to the all too familiar desert world. We see her jumping through star destroyers showing she has a tenacity and natural athleticim. Kylo is introduced as someone strong in the force, powerful and merciless, but with an anger that is yet to be controlled. Finn is introduced as a turncoat to the Empire, meeting up with Poe, who instantly we want to see escape and forming instant chemistry through that action. But this is where the story takes a diversion...one literally built to undermine one of the main characters and replace him with OT nostalgia...let me explain.Finn loses Poe and finds Rey, and what is the two things they need to get off of the rock they find themselves on? A ship and a hotshot pilot, so it would be logical to have a small side quest to find Poe, but this never happens... instead we get a poorly covered up fake death and instead Rey begins her Mary Sue plot dive, piloting the Millenium Falcon, a notoriously hard to pilot ship out of harms way, and Poe gets replaced with none other than Han Solo in the second arc.Here Han steals the show, something we expect from the likes of veteran actor and fan favourite Harrison Ford, but unfortunately does not work in the films favour as the building of Rey, Finn and Kylo is left at the wayside to give Rey and Han a sidebar that never actually pays off (I mean she doesn't call herself a Solo in the end, despite finding the closest link she ever has to a father). Han then gets his connection to Leia and we see that pan out, and then Han becomes the main hero when Leia asks him to bring back Kylo from the brink. And don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic storyline with great parts and an excellent death at the end, but we have well and truly de-railed here and we are no longer on the path of creating a new trilogy. Instead we are watching a featurette within a movie about Han Solo and a final arc that copies far too closely to ANH leaving it predictable and stagnant. We also have the use of Starkiller to destroy planets we never see and people we don't know (no emotional connection = no payoff, not even later in the story).
There is some growth here, Rey and the saber (that never pays off), Finn wanting to run but deciding not too (despite having no real reason to stay, except for his unproven loyalty to Rey) and Poe who becomes an X-Wing cameo whilst Han does all the hard stuff.
The finale comes with Kylo and Rey facing off in an awkward battle which looks aesthetically nice, that helps to build up Finn as another wielder of the force and warrior (something that never pays off) but is filled with clumsyness and yet more Mary Sueing from Rey (which we also see through her ability to overcome Kylo's interrogating technique in the course of a few days with no actual training) as she beats a trained swordsman and force user, trained by none other than Luke Skywalker and a clone of Palpatine, arguably the two most powerful force users too date in Star Wars canon (let alone Leia, Han and others).In conclusion, TFA starts off strong, with some really interesting characters, but JJ's fear to rely on them to carry the story and over reliance on ANH plot lines and OT characters belittles the story and stops true growth. The whole movie ""feels"" like Star Wars, but in the end it fails to create a good movie with solid arcs that are dedicated to bringing four new characters into the Star Wars universe to be loved by the fans."
" Something Fans of the Old Star Wars Should Enjoy
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,"Disney bought Lucasfilm from George Lucas back in 2012 so owned the rights to STAR WARS. This was their first dip into making a new STAR WARS film. Hey, I gotta tell you I loved it as it was really the first time for me since seeing RETURN OF THE JEDI that I was excited about a STAR WARS film. I saw it twice at the theatre which is a rarity. But it does come with flaws.Here in the 7th part of the STAR WARS films Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is out there somewhere in the galaxy. He has decided to hide due to his failed Jedi training with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who is part of a new evil that is taking shape in the galaxy. Due to this evil Skywalker must be found to put peace back in the galaxy. Thing is no one knows where he is. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) gets part of a map of Skywalker's whereabouts and puts it in BB-8 (who is essentially the new R2-D2). The droid ends up on Jakku (which interestingly looks a lot like Tatooine to me). There he meets the heroine of the story Rey (Daisy Ridley). So along with Finn (John Boyega) who used to be a stormtrooper there are off to return the droid to the Resistance to find Skywalker.Other old Star Wars characters pop up along the way like Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2, and of course Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). It is great to see Solo and Chewy again 30+ years later and still in action. Also some great space battles and of course the effects are top notch.Problems I did have with the film though are first off it is extremely derivative of A NEW HOPE. To the point that some of the wonder or imagining what will happen next is wiped away from the film. Due to some surprises and new characters though the wonder does still exist. They have also created another Death Star. Not for the second time, which to me they got away with in RETURN OF THE JEDI, but for a third time. To me it seems like lazy writing if you can not come up with new ideas to inject into a story. Finally, I really do enjoy the Rey character, but once again seems like lazy writing as first I would say she can fly the Millennium Falcon better than Han Solo, Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian combined. Which is fine, but make it a little more believable. As well her ability with the force is not really believable as it comes to her so easily. Its like they wanted her to have Luke's ability by the end of A NEW HOPE before we really even get there. Do love the ending battle though between Rey and Kylo Ren. Amazing winter setting.To me though this film did have a lot that old Star Wars fans really enjoy. What they did well they did extremely well. Written by J.J. Abrams (who also directed), Lawrence Kasdan (who also co-penned THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI) and Michael Arndt. Followed by THE LAST JEDI, which I thought really missed the mark. I will rewatch though and give a review, but it was the film that made me double down on knowing that I am not a Star Wars fanatic and do see problems that were in the films after the original three were released. If you enjoy Star Wars though this is highly recommended."
" Star Wars, but not LucasFilm
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,6,"There was potential to become a great sequel to the original triology, but if a movie leans on the characters who are coming back instead of the lead. It's a failure to me.
I'm new to the Star Wars franchise, so maybe I'm wrong, but this movie didn't feel like LucasFilm. It felt like a Disney sci-fi adventure. It had a really good scene at the end, but also a Disney Channel love/friendship story in the beginning.I give it a 6/10. It's not bad, but definitely not good."

Third, whenever they allowed rey to take Luke Skywalker's lightsaber and actually injure a SKYWALKER with it is such a disgrace.

",2020-12-11 00:00:00,9,"The Force Awakens is the first Star Wars film by Disney. It's has a great story and great action scenes. It has WAY too many jokes and although the acting is good, sometimes it's a bit too cheerful. Overall great movie and you should really watch it."
" Do Protect yourself! Forget this crap!
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,1,"I know when I like a movie immediately, but I only know when is really good or superb when I enjoy seeing it again. Moreover, in some cases, I have to control myself in order not to ruin it due to too much repetition in a short period. Rewatchability is something extraordinary. And even if the pleasure won't last forever, since everything changes so much, some films can endure quite a lot. I think that Star Wars original movies are completly rewatchable. Lots of people have seen them dozens and dozens of times. And even now, when one cannot see them afresh, and you have to deal with the the old-fashioned special effects and with logical aging related problems and limitations, even in that scenario, I would prefer to see again any of them than this film. Really, this film has nothing. Perhaps just the esthetics and aura of Snoke and some other scene, but at most I will find myself seeing a 4 minute video on youtube about it.
Let alone the two movies of the trilogy that follow this film. One can hardly imagine how they came to fruition, it is plainly unbelivable unless the authors were in complete isolation and losed track there, besides some evident kind of masochistic sabotage to themselves and sadism with the fans. Just imagine the fact that Luke, Han and Leia being killed in front of your eyes and then resurrecting Palpatine to be the grandfather of the main new character to show blatanly the whole mess they are drowning into. As said, beyond unbelievable.
At the end, this new trilogy is even dangerous, so the originals movies can be spoiled to the bone. So, do protect yourself, forget them all if you can.
I would only mention Rogue one as a good film in this new series, with some rewatchability and with any dangers to the original story."
" It's really makes me sad..
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,1,"I am angry and sad. It shows us money can accomplish anything. If you pay enough money, you can destroy memories, childhoods, feelings. You have polluted our memory of Star Wars disney. I hate the fact old characters future is garbage because disney bought their future. Why did you have to ruin it ? There are other storylines in Star Wars universe. You could make The Old Republic. Why pollute our beloved characters, our sagas for money ? They knew they were going to sale millions, because they used Luke or Leia etc. I like Mandolorian by the way but I also now it will add up with this garbage story of ""Rey"" so it makes less enjoyable for me. I hate all of the new movies you made. I can write a better story just myself. Shame.. Even their new games are so lack of imagination. Some people do have the power to create things, but not all of them deserve it(Disney)"
" What a bad star wars

" How Dare They Call This Star Wars??
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,2,Cloned Scam Wars maybe!From the beginning until the end this movie is so cloned and uninteresting. I hated the gender switch in this movie. I've been wanting to watch it for a long time but I chose not to because of the reviews and they were correct. They were not wrong. This movie is boring and makes you feel sad for humanity.
" A familiar successor
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,8,"This review contains spoilers.Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens is the sequel to Star Wars Episode VI - Return of the Jedi. The Force Awakens is the first entry to the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The movie is directed by J.J. Abrams and written by Lawrence Kasdan, J.J. Abrams, and Michael Arndt. The movie has Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, and Peter Mayhew reprising their roles of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, C-3PO, and Chewbacca respectively. The new cast is composed of Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, Daisy Ridley as Rey, John Boyega as Finn, and Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron. The story follows the rise of the First Order as they seek a missing Luke Skywalker.The Force Awakens is a rehash of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. The plot and story structure is incredibly similar. Both movies start with a droid having an important object that wanters and encounters the character that will become a Jedi. The villains build a superweapon that destroys a planet. The movie ends with the characters destroying the superweapon. Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens played it too safe. There is not much originality in this Star Wars episode. I am hard pressed to think of what story or plot that this movie does differently. The only things that are different are its environment, characters, and technology.The environment looks the same and is named differently. Jakku and Tatooine function the same way with regards to its plot. Likewise, the movie explored different planets that are pretty to look at but are vapid. The characters in this movie are different. The highlight here is John Boyega as Finn. I enjoyed his character arc where he goes from a First Order trooper to a Resistance fighter. Poe Dameron does not get as much screen time but he does well in the movie. Daisy Ridley as Rey is the star in this movie and she does well in her role. What is not good is Rey as a character.Rey is a bland character. I had hoped there would be more of a character arc with her, but this mostly involves her use of Force powers instead of interesting character interactions. The only good character interactions she had is with Han Solo. Even with her interaction it was all to show how adept she is at every skill she employs. This is the main difference and why I thought Finn is a better character. He had his shortcomings but still had a conflict. By the end of the movie, he had tried overcoming them and had more involved character interactions across the movie.Even with the flaws above, the movie does a good job with everything else. The movie uses its action and effects well. Every action moment plays an important event in the story. The action is also well-shot and directed. J.J. Abrams can make an exciting science-fiction movie. The main scene that is well done is the X-Wing fight on Takodana.Overall, I would recommend Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force AwakensGrade: B"
" Disappointment
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,4,"I am not a biggest Star Wars fan who blindly defends original trilogy all the time. I've just decided to start watching the movies in chronological order and it's the 9th movie for me so far since Phase 1.
However, this movie was a real disappointment for me because of bad acting, copy paste scenario, full of cliché and meaningless characters with no profundity whatsoever. I would rather prefer seeing more character development and an original scenario which captures what happened after the victory at Phase 6, the story of Han Solo and his family or Luke Skywalker. Instead, there was another meaningless Death Star and an inferior Darth Vader imitation who can barely defeats an ex storm trooper and a girl in a basic fight.
Also, death of the Han Solo legend was such a big deal but they made it so predictable and ruined all the drama for me.
In short, I think that there was a huge potential and it was wasted in that movie."
" No Thanks to remakes
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,3,"Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves and return any profit to the poor suckers that paid to see this mess. Would have given a 1, but they did land Chewie."
" They rebooted it so they can sell us the same thing all over again
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,3,"I was disappointed because I heard that Star Wars is back, but I wasn't impressed with most of the actor and actress choices. Also it was pretty cheesy in some areas. The story lacked in many areas and was copied from the previous material. It just was a bit disappointing. I didn't hate it but didn't love it."
" Just Di$ney cashing in. Watch Tom & Jerry instead, you'll feel much better.
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,1,"Utterly rubbish. The old ones were MUCH MUCH better.Poor orphan girl (Ray) can do everything without any prior knowledge or training, she can pilot a spaceship, she can use force better than anyone. what king of character making is this?Disappointed. Don't waste any money or time for this movie you will regret it."
" THE FARCE AWAKENS !!!!!!
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,3,"What a kick to the Star Wars gut !
We waited 33 years to watch them kill Han Solo and give us 6 seconds of seeing Luke ( Only at the very end of the film AND with NO dialogue ! ) Horrible ...
Also, NEVER take the villian's mask off for no significant reason in the beginnings of the film !
It makes him completely unintimidating .....
The whole mess was super lame & a total scam to the fans. Embarrassing"
" An Insult, and the Worst Star Wars Movie Ever
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,1,Completely brainless remake. Terrible acting. Painful in every way. Absolutely shocked at the rating here. This movie is the greatest sin of star wars. I would rather watch 8 and 9 on and endless loop than see this monstrosity of a film ever again.
" The force awakens rose again with credit for George Lucas
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,I couldn't believe I was seeing another Star Wars . When I saw the opening crawl I was finally home in Star Wars again . I still give George Lucas the credit for bringing Star Wars back to life thanks to jj Abrams . Can't wait for more Star Wars films on the way
" The Aftertaste Of Yet Another Gender Switch
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,2,"Who needs another gender switch??
Nobody.Mad Max, Oceans 13, Ghosbusters blah blah blah even Charlie's Angels had a gender switch in it (but they refused to make the women men in that case!??!) you know where I am going with that.This film is so pathetically in conformity with what it is supposed to do to be mainstream that it hurts."
" How does this movie have a rating of almost 8?!?
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,1,"It's completely unexplainable how this sad excuse of a movie has such a high rating where if one would open the review section, they'd immediately see a swarm of 1's and 2's given. The majority of the Star Wars community including me is genuinely disappointed of the direction Kathleen Kennedy and co have decided to take by simply ignoring all the extremely well written sources from the Expanded Universe and Legends. Had they not done that, the revenues for the next 2 movies would have been significantly bigger than they are now. To ignore key figures such as Kyle Katarn, Desann, Jerec, Mara Jade and introduce flat and boring characters such as Rey aka Mary Sue, Finn who is a completely useless addition to the story as well as Captain Phasma (no comment about her) makes zero sense to me. Not only that but they copied and slightly altered most of New Hope. What's the point in that? Regardless, the one I am truly disappointed in is none other than George Lucas himself. To let Disney create this abomination out of your life's work is unforgivable... I'm sure he is definitely sorry. 4 billion is a lot of money, but he himself doesn't need that much. He was already a rich enough man. Why let the faith of your life's work lie in the hands of others? I simply don't understand it to this day..."
" Fun, nostalgic and thrilling
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,8,"J.J. Abrams' first pass at Star Wars was an incredibly fun, nostalgic and thrilling experience. Despite the gap in years between the first movie in 1977 and this instalment, the main feeling was that we picked up right where we left off, both in tone and scale. We were also introduced to incredible new characters in the form of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Finn (John Boyega). Drawing heavily on The Empire Strikes Back, this is one of the best reboots in recent memory."

" Return On Investment metric
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,3,"That is what this clone film is about. Star Wars fans, movie buffs and people with self-respect should stay away. Fans of girls who are not attractive should consider this film though. In fact, this whole galaxy does not have a single sexy woman. At least, the girl was not 'diverse' i.e. fat."
" Definitely not the best SW movie by any means but not abysmal by any means as well
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,7,"I'm not going to act like this criticism is not justified for this movie but I swear some people are just jumping on the bandwagon to hate it or just hate it because it's Disney or because of TLJ and TROS. This movie may have flaws but it's still pretty good. Let's just start with the flaws.This movie is way too safe, unoriginal, just hits the same plot beats as ANH, it brings nothing new to the franchise, the action and story is uncreative and Rey needed to be developed more. I get her being a great pilot but an already great force user and great lightsaber duelist is 2 steps too far.Regardless, it's still great. The visuals are beautiful, the acting is great, the character interactions are believable and have great chemistry, I do enjoy the new characters and they all had great potential, the action is well filmed and edited and exciting, it's well-paced and very exciting, the score (while not as good as the original trilogy or prequel trilogy) still brings great stuff to the table, it's well executed, very entertaining and watchable, the emotional beats hit very well (especially Han's death) and I love the ending scene with Luke and Rey and the epic force theme.This movie is not amazing and that 7.9 rating is way too high but goodness me the amount of hate this movie gets is too much and not justifiable. Seriously, I'm looking at these reviews and wondering if we saw the same movie. Bad acting? Bad directing? No story? Did we see the same movie? Overall, I'd recommend TFA of you just want to be entertained for 2 hours as this movie is the perfect movie for that."
" JJ Abram's Cheap Knockoff Of A Better Movie
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"The cheap knockoff in this case is A New Hope. Looking back, there are many similarities to the prequels compared to the sequels. Both started off with a movie many consider the best in both series - The Phantom Menace/A New Hope. Both have a middle film many consider to be the worst in both series - Attack of the Clones/The Last Jedi. However, the main difference between the sequels and prequels is that at least George Lucas tried to do something different. Yes, the prequels are a failure. Yes, the CGI has not aged well and the acting is very wooden. But I can respect his vision and what he was trying to accomplish. By comparison, the sequels are pure Disney garbage, with zero redeemable qualities and a movie (Rise of Skywalker) which is the worst thing ever made.So plowing forward, I can't really add anything else which everyone else has already covered. This is JJ Abrams destroying yet another franchise. Before this, he destroyed Star Trek. The larger Death Star/Planet Killer/Star Killer base gets all blown up and our heroes save the day. Just like in A New Hope. I will say though that I'm really disappointed in so many people who love this piece of garbage. Because its their past nostalgia for Star Wars and characters like Han Solo which drives whatever love they have for this dreck and not quality filmmaking. I'm looking at you RedLetterMedia."
" Do not Call Him Jar Jar Abrams...
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,2,"... unless you have a good lawyer.
Firstly, it is an insult to Jar Jar and secondly Jar Jar may sue you for defamation and he would win.
This director reeks. he just rips off and is so obviously odiously trendy that audiences will gag. Gender switch? Check? Rip off? Check. Reboot (without attribution)? Check. Bore my pants off and destroy Star Wars? Check.No one told Disney that the rebels won in Episode VI.
No one told JJ Abrams that actors should be able to act."
" Sad
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,3,"My friends were telling me about what a twerp JJ Abrams was, so I watched this film to find out if it was true. All I can say is WHAT A TROLL. Why would anyone make such nasty insulting stuff and troll Star Wars? I mean, they're not even remotely funny. Usually there's a element of camp to bad Disney but JJ is simply an arrogant maladjusted attention seeker with nothing useful to offer humanity. His psychopathic behavior appears to be consistent with the greedy traits common to most criminals and rip offs, including sensation seeking, a lack of remorse or guilt, the need for control, and predatory behavior towards art that came before him."
" Not Disappointing
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,2,"It is Disney and JJ Abrams. I fully knew it would blow and destroy Star Wars. I was right.... it is almost like a childhood memory you do not want to destroy! Terrible script, so-called acting and execution. The only worthwhile second in this movie is when C3P0 appears, but you can watch that on Vimeo for free and it takes you 3 seconds."
" Star Wars the Force Awakens

JJ Abrams will be OK.There are so many ideas and people out there he can clone and steal from. He clearly has loads of incriminating evidence against Hollywood bosses, but they all banded together to destroy Star Wars."
" Super underwhelming
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,3,"The plot is a carbon copy of a new hope, the acting falls flat, MARY FREAKING SUE, and the philosophy of the established force just is completely thrown out. And why in heavens name is the victorious Rebellion (episode 6) still a rebellion?? How did that happen?
The only cool thing was the concept of the masked kylo ren. Aside from that this movie (entire trilogy for that matter) is a disappointing view."
" A start of a great disappointment
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,3,"When in 2015 they announced a new Star Wars trilogy that will take place after Ep 6, I thought it was either going to be the best or the worst.Turned out it was the worst.The setting, the characters, the plot, did not feel like Star Wars at all.I think they brought old cameos like Chewie, Han, Leia, C3-P0 and R2-D2 only to remind themselves and their viewers that this IS IN FACT still Star Wars and not some generic space fantasy movie with a non-existing and contrived plot.I sat through the movie hoping for things to improve, but around the second half I had already given up hope and simply did not care at all anymore. I didn't even felt sad, or disappointed or betrayed, I just gave up on Star Wars in an instant and could not be fazed by these horrible movies one bit.I was a Star Wars fan ever since I was 5 year old and my parents brought me to the cinema to see Star Wars Episode 5. I was too young to understand what was going on and not understanding English or being able to read subtitles meant I was just looking at fancy images, but even so I was immediately captivated by it and remained a Star Wars fan ever since. Every game about Star Wars I could get my hands on - I played it, every movie or TV series - watched it, every merchandise I could find - bought it, but these movies succeeded to completely evaporate my fandom of Star Wars and just make me not care about it anymore. Sure, there was a period when I was extremely angry and disappointed that this is how things turned out, but as they kept going in the same direction with subsequent movies and whatnot, I just cared less and less and if tomorrow they say ""Star Wars as a franchise is shutting down"", I wouldn't care one bit. Yes, it would be unfortunate, but it would not be like beating a dead horse, like what Disney have been doing for the past 5 years."
" The New Order Is Disney
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,2,"The audiences are the rebels.A new order threatens to destroy Star Wars. Finn, Rey and Poe backed by another Resistance prove they cannot act and have no appeal. They are deployed by the dark side to crush Star Wars. Audiences must find a way to stop them and find Luke, the last surviving Jedi."
" A great beginning to another saga
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,8,It is very fun and entertaining. The first half is a little slow but picks up the pace as the story goes on. Speaking of the story it is great. The performances of the cast are good. The CGI and visual effects are outstanding. The sad part is that a loved character had to die.
" The Farce Awakens And Stinks up The joint
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,2,"Don't watch this, just waste of time. Only some good graphics and visual can be seen. But specifically we need a story for sitting 3 hours under the banner 'Star Wars.'"
" So boring it hurts
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,5,"UGH!!! I didn't believe when people said that this copy-pasted episode IV. They weren't kidding. I like Oscar Isaac and John Boyega (from other things. It felt like they were hardly in this) and I hope they end up doing more in this trilogy (I had to do digital gymnastics to avoid spoilers because I hadn't seen these until two hours ago). And that giant guy, Snoke, was also kinda cool. I hope he plays a role in the other movies."
" I loved it
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,2,"Just kidding!
To all the spammers giving this a good rating, get over it! hated the Mary Sue power element, but mainly it was just super tacky.A remake film that doesn't need to be taken seriously."
" Best of the trilogyy
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,8,This movie had so much potential to open a great trilogy. Movie as it self is good but it's copying a bit too much New hope
" Disappointing
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,2,I am literally giving this movie 2 stars. 1 star for having Harrison return for this  movie and 1 more star for having good CGI. Other than that complete waste of time.
" War war war and a little story.
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,5,"Visually pleasing and more story than in some episodes, but still a star wars film. In other words: war, battles, fights, sabre duels, etc. Fun for 5 minutes, but not for the main part of a 2 hour movie. Good follow up for Darth Vader though"
" The non creativity let to creativity
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,3,"I did not really want to watch this movie. However I only did so because the Star Wars sequels have led to such a great amount of creative and interesting youtube content (RLM, MauLer, and so on). Just for being better able to follow those youtube movies I decided to watch this again (a bit pathetic perhaps, I know). And I must say, it was a chore. The movie is just so uncreative, ripping off the OT and stacking contrivance upon contrivance.
Just one example: in A New Hope, the droids ""luckily"" end up with Luke. But at least it makes some sense: they were heading to Obi Wan, and Obi Wan was watching Luke. So there is a reason why they would be in that vicinity.
In this movie, the droid ends up with Rey. But there is no connection (established in the movie) between Rey and Poe's contact. It's just lucky she happens to be there also, on that particular part of that particular planet. What are the odds? And that is basically this movie. (random friend of Han happens to have that lightsaber, random stormtrooper defecting on his first combat happens to know the one flaw of the new Death Star, and so on). It just so boring to watch.If I'll give the movie one thing, at least it was a little bit more sufferable than what came after it, meaning it didn't do that much damage to established Star Wars lore. That's what saves it from the 1 star rating.Anyway, back to youtube for me. Just know, a few guys in a livestream of an hour easily come up with much better stories than the makers of the Suckquel Trilogy did in however many months/years. And they didn't even have to given that the EU was right there. Now don't misunderstand me, I could understand that the EU was discarded in order to make room for a better and more coherent alternative. I just can't understand why it was discared if it was replaced with basically nothing."
" 10 Pros & Cons for seeing and not worth seeing 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,8,"Pros1. The dialogue in which the performers had to act was decent. It honestly sounds like everyday talk.2. The visual effects were well done. Love how the studio preference for using real locations and miniature models over green-screens and computer-generated imagery.3. Most of the new main performers were good in their roles. Especially Adam Driver who rose to new heights after this movie.4. It was a fun nostalgia trip full of easter eggs and references. Like how it looks and feels like a Star Wars flick.5. The humor really does work for this film. Love the chemistry that Finn has with everybody. He works well in this role.6. The action scenes were well paced and compelling to watch. Too bad, it would get worst in the next couple of films.7. Composer John Williams' new score was breathtaking. It's worth a listen.8. For the most part, the film was decently paced with 2 hours and 18 minutes runtime.9. All the new characters were very interesting and somewhat compelling. Had high hopes of finding more about them by the end of the film, even we never got a good solution.10. Overall: it's far more entertaining than the more controversial sequels that follow this. Those really did drop the ball.Cons1. The film recycled the main plot of 1977's 'Star Wars: A New Hope'. Hate the whole Starkiller Base sequence. Felt like a tiresome rehash.2. The misused of legendary secondary characters was a bit alarming with Luke Skywalker being absence for most of the film. Leia taking a step back and Han Solo getting killed off before any of them could reunited was disappointing.3. The whole map to Luke Skywalker's plot really makes no sense. Why would he create that if he doesn't want to be found!?4. The contrived coincidence was a bit much to take at times.5. Rey was written as a Mary Sue. She has little flaws and knows nearly everything despite never leaving the planet or flying.6. The whole idea that everybody believes that the events of the first three movies is a myth is really pushing the buttons of disbelief; seeing how connection and technology full these worlds are.7. Bad exposition dumps and lack of it in certain moments throughout the film. We never did find out why Maz had Luke Skywalker's lightsaber or why Leia built a Resistance army.8. The whole CGI squid alien attack sequence was pointless and felt out of place.9. Poe Cameron was clearly the most underwritten of the three. We hardly got to know him.10. The film can seem a bit like eye candy at times with all the nostalgia feeding it gave."
" A Loving Tribute? Or Maybe Just a Rehashed Version of the Classic Fairy Tale
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,6,"It was very hard for me as an adult to take this movie seriously, being that it's mostly a rehash of the original 1977 Star Wars but with a severe Mary Sue case.The plot is almost identical to A New Hope but with small adjustments, none of which are groundbreaking. The undercover infiltration of Imperial facilities happens all over again. It's very convenient that Imperial fleets/moons/planets always have all their control overrides set in one room with two guards on it, and the rebels can always land in it with pinpoint accuracy.The lead character made it especially hard for me to suspend my disbelief and actually enjoy the movie. That girl is an Olympics-class professional at whatever she laid her hands on throughout the movie, from piloting to aerospace mechanics to dueling Sith lords. It's so blatant it's ridiculous.Needless to say, the movie does have a bit of humor and some nostalgic moments that original Star Wars fans would appreciate, but that's about it.Overall, this movie sits on the then line between paying a loving tribute to Star Wars, and between being a mediocre and predictable entry in the saga. I personally felt the latter."
" One of my faves
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,9,"In 1977, I watched A New Hope as a five year old. The Star Wars mythos had me in its grip from the beginning. Now with my 9 year old son we are watching all of the movies in the release order. We just finished watching The Force Awakens. I see all of these negative reviews for the latest movies so I had to add a positive one. It seems like knocking the new Star Wars movies has become trendy like hating Nickelback (although I DO hate Nickelback)!Unlike the first 3 episodes (4th to 6th releases), these provide the comic relief of the originals, even more so. The characters aren't terribly believable, but they at least HAVE character, something the characters in episodes 1,2, and 3 often tended to lack. This movie is a lot of fun, although the plot isn't terribly believable. They are fantasy movies, for crying out loud. If you want realism, watch something else.Ren is a superb villain because he is conflicted, unstable, and immature. Rey is dynamite. This movie had more than enough throwback nostalgia to appeal to lovers of the original movies, but enough fresh material, not to mention set, ship, and creature design, to avoid redundancy. This was the most visually attractive Star Wars I've seen, although we have two more to watch. And the classic score is there, at least elements of it!If you want A New Hope all over again, you might be disappointed. If you want something completely original, you may feel unfulfilled by this entry. If you want something realistic with fully believable characters and coincidences, you'll likely be disappointed. If you love the things that I love about the franchise - amazing design, thrilling battles, a scifi fantasy escape from humdrum reality, and a magical mythology based on good versus evil - you'll love this movie."
" Annoyingly stupid approach to evil
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,2,"One of the main themes of this saga should be the conflict between Light and Darkness and their role in the universe, the call of good and the seduction of evil. In an ideal world, we would see 'Evil' characters whose inner life reflects this duality.
Instead we had Kylo Ren (lmaooo), Hux (potentially interesting if not for the tired space nazi thing) and Snoke (lmaoooox2).
These people devoted their life to the Dark Side (in one way or another) but they are cartoonishly incapable to work together cohesively because they are too evil. While the good guys can cooperate flawlessly because they are inherently good. There's no conflict anywhere (except in Ren's badly portrayed mind)."
" Defending This Movie
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,8,"Let me say this right off the bat: ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is not a horrible film. I'm sure most people in their right minds will agree with this statement. I personally think that people have the wrong idea about what makes ""Star Wars"" great in the first place. It's a simple, straightforward, and fast-moving story. There are clear villains and heroes. Frenetic action that is spectacle and also suspenseful. ""Star Wars"" is not a thinking man's franchise. It never has been. So for anyone who criticizes this movie for being unoriginal and just derivative of the original trilogy: the original trilogy itself was unoriginal and derivative of fairy tales, science fiction serials, and Japanese cinema. George Lucas was a visionary in terms of bringing us an interesting and unique universe as dressing for a simple fairy tale story, and also by bringing us ground-breaking special effects. He was never a terrific storyteller, so people who come to a ""Star Wars"" movie expecting to see something that will move you or make you think, I'm sorry that you have that impression of the franchise.""The Force Awakens"" is set about thirty years after the end of ""Return of the Jedi."" In that span of time, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) began training a new generation of Jedi Knights. After his academy was destroyed, Luke went into hiding somewhere within unknown space. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the First Order, who are the remnants of the Galactic Empire, are looking for a map that will lead to the location of Luke, but Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), a pilot for the Resistance, hides the map inside his droid, BB-8. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the desert planet Jakku. She finds BB-8 and also runs into Finn (John Boyega), an ex-stormtrooper who fled to the surface, and the trio escape the planet on board the Millennium Falcon. They are eventually tracked down by Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew/Joonas Suotamo), who lead them to the Resistance base.I will admit, this movie is flawed. Rey is probably the worst part of this movie. It's incredibly un-dramatic to have a main character that can literally do everything by herself and never fail. Also, the story beat where we have yet another planet-killing super weapon is very dull. The forced Marvel-esque humor also feels really out of place in this franchise. This movie also has the misfortune of being followed by two of the most controversial films in the saga. I think that people will unfairly group this movie with those in a package critique of the sequel trilogy for many years to come. Which is unfortunate, because I actually think this movie shines in a lot of places.Harrison Ford absolutely steals the show in his most iconic role. It's so awesome to see him slip back into being Han Solo after thirty years. And there's some heartfelt character development here as well. He's much more mature and wise this time around. I love how he's still making and breaking deals with the low-life riff raff of the galaxy. Kylo Ren is also really cool too. It's interesting to see a ""Star Wars"" villain who struggles with the pull to the light side. We're often just shown the pull of the dark side from the perspective of our heroes, but I really like the concept that Kylo Ren is a lost individual who might not be as evil as he would like to be, and that certain actions he takes in the film don't necessarily satisfy him in the ways that he would like. This is good character writing.Finn is slightly less compelling. I like the idea of one of our heroes being an ex-stormtrooper, but this concept never really goes anywhere after he initially leaves the First Order. I like the scene where he fights one of the other stormtroopers, but I wish we were given more scenes where we may have been shown the impact that the First Order had on him. Maybe if he had a good friend that he had to leave behind or something like that.The plot is always straightforward and very easy to follow, which is a lot more than can be said for other ""Star Wars"" movies. Like I said earlier, this franchise is not meant to be taken so seriously. They're light-hearted adventure movies. Action scenes are visually engaging. The lightsaber duel at the end is visceral and brutal; it feels much more like an actual sword fight than the highly choreographed ballerina-twirling of the prequel trilogy. And that can be said of this movie in general; there seems to be so much more life and energy here than in the entire prequel trilogy that preceded it.The ""Star Wars"" saga had a definitive ending with ""Return of the Jedi."" There didn't need to be any other movies expanding the story beyond the destruction of the Empire. There's also the sad reality to contend with that ""The Force Awakens"" will always be attached to the abysmal mess that was ""The Rise of Skywalker."" But if you take this movie alone on its own; if you sit down with a bowl of popcorn and dim the lights and just shut off your brain for two and a half hours, you're going to be surprised by how much you actually like this movie. The energy and life and fun that it has with itself propel it beyond its confines within a larger saga. People really need to just chill about ""Star Wars"" and learn how to enjoy a fun movie. This is a fun movie."
" John Boyega's acting ruins the movie.
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,1,"Well it's a bad movie anyway but John Boyega continues to ruin Star Wars.
His wooden personality and role adds nothing to the story. He should stick to his London gang movie roles where he just walks like a ruuudeboy and suck his lips alot acting bad."
" Better than no Star Wars at all?
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,3,"So we have a Mary Sue with zero training who can hold her own in light saber combat, a ""villain"" who is nothing more than a petulant teenager, another hollow shell of a ""villain"" who looks like a giant Gollum, and no lore or much of a story at all. The ""first order""? Where did they spring up from? Did everyone in the New Republic fall asleep immediately after the second death star was destroyed? And can't anyone think of anything else besides yet another death star?And what's this total disrespect of killing off the main characters? I compare the makers of this movie to a child thinking that the Mona Lisa needs a friend, so they draw a stick figure in beside her.Disney has shown that they can make something half decent like Rogue One and The Mandalorian, yet why make up trash for the main movies? (Also Resistance is especially bad. I quit watching after developing a deep disgust with the goofy and inept main character.)Still, I suppose this Star Wars is better than none at all. The first ten minutes is not bad."
" Living proof of the waste Disney throws out at us
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,3,I can't think of a single film that JJ Abrams has ever dished out that doesn't pop the question into one's mind 'how does this guy get any jobs?' He is good at playing the network I guess but has no talent.
" This Is All Wrong
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,3,"This is not a sequel. it is a remake.
In the last episode the good guys won and their power was restored. Here they make it like none of that happened.
It is almost as if they want this film to be for preteens and younger only!"
" Remake or reboot??
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,5,"I'm not a big star wars fan. In fact, I just recently decided to watch the entire series of movies. This is basically a new hope again except with crappy characters and an over emphasis on comedy.Snoke - awful character, and awful name. In no way threatening at all.Kylo Ren - awful. Major inconsistencies in his abilities too. Sometimes he senses people miles away, other times he doesn't. Sometimes he force stops bullets, other times he gets shot. Makes sense... Also, his saber skills are pretty weak for an all powerful sith lord...Finn - literally just there for comic relief. Also completely abandons his lifelong belief system in like 7 minutes cause someone gets killed. At least try develop a bit lads.BB8 - Doesn't actually do anything helpful in the whole movie. Just makes noises which are comedically interpreted.Rey - She was pretty good actually. Enjoyed her."
" Star wars
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,9,The force awakens was an excellent Film starring Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. Like all the other Star Wars here lot of action and the effects were very good so if you're a Star Wars fan you have to see this one
" Spectacle, action and a good story - I really liked this film
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,8,"30 years after the fall of the empire, a new dark force known as the first order are trying to hunt down the whereabouts of legendary jedi Luke Skywalker. A droid known as BB-8 houses a map which houses the location of Luke Skywalker which the dark side are keen to get their hands on. However, the rebel alliance are prepared to do everything in their power to prevent the force from accessing this information whatever the cost...If I'm totally honest I've found the Star Wars franchise something of a bumpy ride overall; whereas episodes 4, 5 and 6 are right hailed as being the best the franchise has to offer, episodes 1,2 and 3 were a little lacking in comparison (although I have to admit that episode 3 came close to being as good as some of the later prequels).I have to admit I feared the worst with this 7th instalment (particularly going in knowing that this was the point when Lucas sold the franchise to Disney), but I have to admit that The Force Awakens is really good and manages to bring about the best parts of the original franchise.The first big plus with this film lay with the pacing and for this director J.J Abrams deserves a big pat on the back. Considering it's 2 hour runtime this film moves at a lightning pace without losing any of the strong storytelling or good characterisation. I was also concerned that, given the fact that the film was made in 2015, that The Force Awakens would be a CGI mess, but Abrams doesn't overdo things here and in some ways shows a lot of respect to the original franchise.The next big positive lies with the characters; it's clear that Rey and Finn are meant to be the new age Leia and Han Solo and to their credit they do an admirable job in bringing in the humour and the love/hate relationship that we saw with the aforementioned characters. OK whether they achieved this with the same degree of success is up for debate, but I liked their characters and liked what they brought to their respective roles. It was also nice to see a lot of recurring characters return to the franchise who all contributed in making this film work in their own unique ways.There's not much I didn't like about this film but if I'm being super-critical I suppose one could argue that the leader of the first order is not quite as intriguing or menacing as Darth Vader (although I am prepared to admit that this is addressed in the film and he's perhaps purposefully portrayed as being more vulnerable than Darth Vader). There are 2 scenes when he goes bat-poo crazy which is very different to the icy cool demeanour of Darth Vader which perhaps hint that we are witnessing a very different beast here. I also felt that Oscar Isaacs was a little under-utilised and could have been used better in the film.Still pound for pound in terms of enjoyment, this is one of the best of the franchise for me and gives my current favourite film of the franchise (The Empire Strikes Back) a good run for its money. In short, I'm glad I gave it a chance and I most definitely was not disappointed."
" Disney tries to reboot a cult anthology but failed miserably: many plot holes and disappointing cast overall
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,4,"Never understood why the new Star Wars trilogy got so much hate from the fandom, but after I rewatched all previous chapters (including Rogue One), I can understand why people that follows this saga since the beginning were so hard with it.First of all, the main villain is not credible at all. Beating Darth Vater for charisma is impossible, he will always be one of the best villain in cinema, but screenwriters could come up with something better than a crying kid that does not know what he wants. I never felt scared by Kylo Ren, and the overall interpretation is awful. Adam Driver, which a really good actor, does what he can, but I think that the main issue is on how the character was developed in the first place on the screenplay.We know since the beginning that a new order is risen from the ashes of the old empire, but during the movie there are too many missing information. You cannot really understand how this new dark side originated, where some important characters come from. Everything is very confusing and even if I have watched the entire saga, it feels like I have skipped a chapter of Star Wars.The movie is way too long, and filled with useless scenes. Too much cringey humor, Disney is very good to create ""comedic"" moments where is not needed. CGI is good, nothing to say, but this does not compensate the overall disappointment. They should have ended the saga with Episode VI."
" The Dismantling Of Star Wars Begins
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,2,"This is where the beginning of the end of Star Wars happened. It used to be a venerable institution of hope and fantasy. It is now a douchebagged self cover version with a frowning girl instead of a man, boring cliches and Disney fantasy magic. No love interest, no story, no character development, never mind. Forget Star Wars"
" A honest try to restart Star Wars
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,5,The people involved in this movie tried their best to start the new trilogy very carefully by not overloading it with new stuff. That was a good idea. The whole movie just suffers from so many problems. The main problem is that this movie is not focusing on the main protagonist and instead tries to do a lot of world building and checking of long lists of stuff that need to happen. What people disturbed the most was an murder and death of one character that not made a huge amount of sense. Still this movie is watchable.
" Back to a winning formula
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,8,"The first Star Wars movie, ""Episode III: A New Hope,"" set the pattern, characters, plot, and setting for all subsequent ""episodes."" With ""A New Hope"" being by far the best of the lot, it made sense for the producers, after losing sight of what made that such a fantastic film (great visuals, not taking itself too seriously, classic good guys vs. bad guys, action-packed climax, etc.) to try to go back to that winning formula. The new story has a lot of ""in jokes"" which someone who hasn't seen Episode III wouldn't get. It also has certain character roles repeated with slight twists, i.e. social misfit who's real adventurous and skilled with weapons-Luke Skywalker in the first movie, Rey in this one - except Rey is female. Death Star as center of villainy in the first film, super giant Death Star in the same role this time. X-Wing fighters blowup Death Star using plans smuggled to them by a cute droid: R2D2 in the first film, BB-8 in this one. The list goes on and on, but at least the script and editing are good enough to make the story entertaining, if somewhat repetitive. Many inconsistencies bothered me but one in particular. When someone is handing a light saber to another person, shouldn't it be handle first? That rule applies to guns, knives, and other dangerous elements but that doesn't stop Rey from handing the weapon blade-first to Kylo Ren. (I think Han Solo should have thought of that also when he was trying to get Kylo Ren to switch sides, with disastrous results, for Han.)"

" Well made film but an unsatisfying and unoriginal story
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,7,"The Galactic Republic is once more under a repressive regime of rulers using the dark side of the force.Like many others, I was excited having waited so many years to find out what happens next after the iconic trilogy. Then JJ Abrams' first episode of the sequel trilogy captured not only the spirit of the original movie but repackaged the entire formula using a new generation of characters.I was quite conflicted on my exit from the cinema. On one hand it showcases epic visual storytelling, mind-blowing spectacle, powerful emotions and great performances. Then on the other, it has wiped the slate clean and simply repackaged the same plot with new and old characters.It feels to me like Disney's way of putting its stamp on tried and tested formula. We have the returning actors reprising former roles alongside: new black masked villain, new emperor, young new hope, new reluctant hero, new droid, new X-Wing pilot, new rebellion, new Empire, new Death Star, new alien bar and so on.All of the above is contained within a plot that places a McGuffin inside a droid, who takes it to a humble young heroine, meets a reluctant hero and they go on an adventure that provides a lightsaber battle, the death of a much loved older character and culminates in the destruction of a massive, planet killing weapon.Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Adam Driver are all pitch perfect in the their roles, particularly Driver who has immense presence and emotional range. Ridley and Boyega have excellent chemistry and their scenes that rip-up the traditional male led movie heroics are a joy to watch.I have to admit as a childhood fanboy I was almost a child again when I first saw Han and Chewie back on the Millenium Falcon. However, the character development for me has driven a lightsaber through the heart of the legacy left by the original trilogy. Placing Han back where he started just before killing him off, Leia back in the midst of a war and Luke in a pretty dark place all bothered me. I never really thought about it until now, but I think I took some satisfaction by imagining all these characters were finally able to live peaceful lives after Return of the Jedi.The scenes on Starkiller base were immensely well done, making me almost physically sick as Han falls to his death, my heart bled as Chewie reacts and the hairs on the back of my neck rise as the lightsaber flies past Kylo Ren and into Rey's hand.There is no denying The Force Awakens is an excellent piece of filmmaking and storytelling. Unfortunately, as good as it tells the story it was not the one that I wanted to hear."
" Thanks to Disney it is embarrassing to like Star Wars Now

" It kinda blends in after all.
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,7,"Even tho in a completely different style, Episode VII still manages to bring something new to the Star Wars ""table"", even tho many, rightly so, judge the movie for being, simply said, way to millenial. There is again a gender swtich, which goes with the modern flow, but still, it does not ruin the vibe, the only things being wrong are those that do not respect the way the saga evolved. There is blood shown many times, which is totally off, since we did not see any blood even in Episode III, which had the most gore. Also Rey uses mind control without moving her hands at all, which is completely opposite to the Jedi way, we've seen Obi's gestures many times.Then there is the fact that she did not require any training at all to use her powers, while Anakin and Luke worked their socks off to become what they have been. I was also very dissapointed with the fact that Solo died, but it gave weight to the movie, deeper meaning which made it more important for the complete picture in the end. I was so happy to see Luke back again in the last scene and I can't wait to see what comes next!"

",2020-08-08 00:00:00,5,"The prequels were ok but this one is just bad.In A New Hope we see how luke struggles to becone a jedi and use the force but here someone just closes their eyes and voila,they are the greatest jedi to ever exist."
" A satisfying addition to the franchise in a format that has already been perfected
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,7,"The Force Awakens is definitely an entertaining movie, with an entertaining hero, villain, and storyline. The problem is that it is all too familiar.The (spoiler-free) plot is: a force-sensitive hero who dreams of escaping their desert homeworld is visited by outsiders who fight for a rebel alliance against an oppressive force that rules over the galaxy. They team up with Han Solo, and fly away on the millennium falcon. There is also a power-hungry antagonist and a planet destroying device. This is the plot of both The Force Awakens and the first installment of the saga, A New Hope.Other than this blatant lack of originality, the movie is totally enjoyable. Stellar CGI, outstanding music, good characters, good creature designs, witty lines and creative new planets are littered throughout this film. It doesn't ruin any existing characters (although I do wish some characters had more screen time) and it adds some interesting new characters, both good and bad.Overall, if you ignore that the film is essentially a remake, you will have a blast watching it."

They appeal to a new audience and they are humorous and very cool. Nostalgia is abundant with the return of Han, Leia and Chewy!

" Disney didn't know what to do with Star Wars
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,2,"What happened here is pretty simple. George Lucas had finished his work and was sad on bad critics about his prequel and remaster, so he decided to never do anymore work on Star Wars. Being he finished with it, he had a top valued franchise on his hands and sold it to anybody willing to pay. Disney executives had much more money than they could handle and decided to take the chance.Now Disney has the property and needs to return the investment and profit from it. Of course they'd make a sequel trilogy, and bring back all old actors. But what story would they use, if episode 6 had finished it all and it was well publicly known that George wasn't willing to make any continuation?They could have explored the extended past of the lore, but then they'd be unable to bring back original actors. They decided then to create new characters: a new villain child of Han and Leia, a new villain boss, and a new hero coming from apparent nowhere.These characters were just too bad written, and too much based on original ones. The gender switch became too obvious, new pets are too forced, and whole plot was written to be finished on future movies, but it was later changed and never finished as intended."
" A good follow-up but not stunning

A lot of it is repetitive and the new elements like the new characters just seem like typical blockbuster material. It feels like a more commercialised version of Star Wars that has taken its surface elements and used it to make a more conventional product. It's not bad. Just not great."

" A long time ago in a Politically Correct galaxy far, far away ...
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,6,"I won't get bogged down discussing the blatant political correctness of ""The Force Awakens"" (God forbid I offend someone) and it is not really necessary to point out the obvious, but what I will say on the get-go here is that I was suckered in to the irresistible nostalgic buzz that the film offered upon it's release in 2015. Like many people, ""Star Wars"" was my childhood. So I needed a more neutral viewing some years later to really give this film the once-over. In a nutshell, I've come to the conclusion that ""The Force Awakens"" is a poor film but with a nostalgic vibe that carries it along and makes it seem to be a far better film than it really is. Nonetheless, I give it a decent rating, purely for Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. The film is shamelessly a scene-by-scene remake of ""A New Hope""; Luke Skywalker is now a young woman and Darth Vader is Kylo Ren. And the Death Star even has a replacement. The Empire is now The New Order... I could go on, but at the risk of giving this a lower rating. Overall, this is purely one for the die-hard fans that needed the nostalgic lift a years ago. But now, and in future, I believe it will be completely forgotten about and relegated to being the lesser of the franchise, even worse than ""Attack of the Clones""."

" Excellent start to a new trilogy in the Star Wars franchise...
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,8,"1st watched 7/14/2020 - (Dir-J.J. Abrams):
Excellent start to a new trilogy in the Star Wars franchise. This movie has the same energy and appeal as the original with a very similar storyline, but I didn't really care that this was the case. It starts with the patented pre-story scroll that we have expected from the series, and we learn that Luke Skywalker is missing at the point where he was supposed to be training a new group of rebels, and the ""First Order"" is now the new Empire with the rebellion just hanging on by a thread....sound familiar? The character ""Rey"" is a lonely parent-less new Skywalker-type and is already filled with the force, but is a slave without a hope or purpose for herself. The rebellion determines that a droid has a map to find the actual Skywalker, but lose it and it gets dropped off on Rey's planet and she acquires it. At the same time - the First Order lead by a Darth-Vader type character(who happens to be the child of Han and Leia) also is aware of this, and the chase after her and the droid begins. I guess they both believe that finding Skywalker will have a major impact on the campaigns because he will decide to continue what he stopped doing when found ? (this could be a stretch) Finn is a character who is similar to Hans in the original movie, but is a defector from the dark side's army(actual he is a sanitation person but still a part of them), and wants to help the rebellion now. They pick up the Millinieum Falcon in a junk yard while escaping and they get pulled into what they think is owned by the dark side, but ends up being a smuggling post lead by the actual Han Solo. He and chewie than get connected to their old ship, but Rey gets picked up by the evil side setting up the ""rescue of the maiden premise."" Amazingly later we find out that the new ""Death Star"" has a spot the rebellions can shoot at and blow up it up....doesn't this sound familiar? The new General Leia directs the troops to do this and we than have a reunion of Han and Leia. So - like I said - a lot like the original, but the tempo and characters are likeable enough to keep you interested most of the way thru. I'm a little amazed I rated this so high, but the movie just pops not unlike the 1st Star Wars movie and finished with a bang and a couple of un-finished threads. Lucasfilm and Abrams knew what worked and they delivered on this continuation of the world of Star Wars."
" A bad start to an Iconic franchise reboot
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,5,"This movie is a soft reboot of the original Star Wars a New Hope. Abrams uses key plot points from the original to try and reignite a franchise that died many years ago.The characters are wooden and the screenplay, pacing and editing seem to be the product of artificial intelligence software.Characters seem to be incredibly lucky, they arrive in critical places because the plot needs them too, not because they get there themselves and bring us along for the ride. It's hard to connect with characters when they just have abilities to do incredible things, we don't know how or why and this just takes the audience out of the movie. One example of this is the character Rey, she has spent her life on a desert planet, hoping to be rescued by her family. When the First Order (the new, less threatening and developed Empire) show up, she miraculously can pilot a classic Star Wars ship and can fly out into space with no prior experience. Later in the movie she also demonstrates abilites to use a lightsaber again with no training. Is this because we need a strong diverse female character? If so, can the filmmakers not invest time in building up this character? I think we as viewers could accept these abilities if they are earned throughout the story and her character arc.Sadly this movie is a mess, and really doesn't make sense in many areas. I don't like to be negative as I am a Star Wars fan. But sloppy filmmaking makes this movie a bad viewing experience.JJ is a master at setting up compelling and interesting plot points, but they rarely go anywhere. Visually the movie looks great, Tie Fighters and X-Wings duking it out never looked better. But visuals make a movie pleasing on the eye, but, without compelling characters that we can get behind, it's all style over substance, a slightly better version of the Michael Bay Transformers movies.So positives are, great looking movie, the actors do a good job with what they are given, John Williams absolutely smashes it out of the park with another amazing score, there are intriguing plot points set up, and finally it's great to see Han and Leia back on screen together.The negatives are the plot bumbles along from place to place and the audience is taken on a long winded, generic ride that we have been on before. Finn, Poe and Rey are in the right place at the right time too often to be believable. Rey is overpowered, can hold her own with a lightsaber with no training and beats Kylo Ren in a fist fight. Speaking of Kylo, he is a tantrum throwing Vader wannabe and it doesn't work. He is not menacing and that lightsaber design makes no sense. A laser cross guard? Also, they changed the ignition switch on Anakins lightsaber? Why'd ya do that JJ? And off course, the mega big super duper death star. Not much needs to be said about that.Finally, why did Luke Skywalker not show up? This was the perfect opportunity to have Han, Leia and Luke back on screen. Huge opportunity missed. And Mark Hammil was really wasted here. It should have been him to had a battle with Kylo. This would have been a great way to introduce him back. Big opportunity missed.In summary, this is a Disney production, it waters down Star Wars into an average family movie that misses the mark in several ways, fan service is offered up like a manufacturing assembly line of forced humour, jokes that don't land and setup to a Marvelesc cinematic universe. In short, let's print some dollar and appeal to the widest audience possible. I regret to say that this is a 5/10 and in time this rating will drop.And... Wait until The Last Jedi & Rise of Skywalker. All I can say is OMG, it gets so much worse.Peace ..."
" Not a SW film
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,1,"This is not Star Wars, this is something else and something completely bad. Pretentious fake."
" Technology caught up with Lucas' ideas
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,7,"This movie is, more or less, what George Lucas would probably do with ""A New Hope"" in 2015. It lacks originality and it commits some of the sins of the first one (the story is simplistic, the dialogue is basic, the characters not groundbreaking)......But it is also freaking impressive. Abrams made an amazing spectacle of a movie, taking basic ideas presented in the original (and some from the other ones), but with the capabilities of today's CGI (and a much brisker pace, for better or worse). The action is much better and it nevers gets too long, and it has enough wrinkles that makes it different enough not to be just a remake of ""Hope"".And it also has way better acting. Ridley stands over Hamill's shoulders, and with Boyega and Driver gives us three amazing leading performances."
" JJ Abrams BUZZ OFF
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,2,"And take your pimp Kathleen with you.This is not a continuation of Star Wars. This remake is a discontinuation with a gender flip.
Horrible
This movie is a horrible discontinuation of Star Wars."
" Walmart brand A New Hope
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,1,"Copies scene for scene A New Hope, while simultaneously forcefeeding boring new characters and killing off the established fan favorites.
Beautiful and terrible."
" Fun
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,9,"I'll be honest, part of the reason I'm writing this review is out of spite, purely because I'm so sick of the disproportionate amount of hate that the sequels have been getting. As a start to the trilogy, this is a well-shot, fun, and entertaining movie with charismatic and entertaining characters, as well as plenty of suspense. Sure, it's an homage to A New Hope, but it's tonally different. I'm just confused with why die-hard fans continue to tear this film apart, while calling the absolute train wreck that is The Phantom Menace a masterpiece. Sure, I love all Star Wars, but I can't, with good conscience, call Episode I a fun and exciting kick off to the prequel trilogy. That's what The Force Awakens does well-it keeps Star Wars fun and fresh, something that fans of all ages can enjoy, while successfully introducing a new era with new characters and a new story. Because Star Wars is supposed to be fun-and this movie brought it back."
" The best of the Disney Star Wars films!
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,8,"I probably would've rated this 10/10 back in 2015. I absolutely loved TFA and saw it multiple times in the cinema and bought it day one on Blu-Ray and watched it multiple times again. In 2020, my rating slips to an 8/10, mostly because the hype has subsided. The Force Awakens is still a fantastic Star Wars film, which is made even more fun and satisfying now knowing what we know now about where certain characters stories end up going across the trilogy. The set piece involving the Falcon and some TIE Fighters on Jakku is truly one of the biggest highlights of the trilogy, it captures everything that made Star Wars so magical to begin with whilst being shot in a modern, engaging, visually stunning way. It's not without its flaws, which you can go discover for yourselves, but SW:TFA is such a fun sci-fi rollercoaster ride that you have to experience."
" No reason for a trilogy...
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,3,"With the exception of the final lightsaber hand over scene, the movie was wrapped up in the same sloppy bow it was presented in.
Good triumphed over evil without any training?!? Seriously Disney, and people who support this trash the most evil get defeated in one movie by kids with no training.I would have been satisfied with this being left as a cliffhanger, seeing where the other movies went."
" I liked it more after watching other 2
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,8,"The best out of 3 new films...This is not to say they were great, but I found something good in them that made the whole trilogy worth watching despite differewnt flaws. The most interesting part of the new story for me was Kylo Ren and Rey stories and evolution of their relationship. Kylo and Rey were the only characters who showed some character development and kept the moview together. This episode was generally made better that the next 2 and had few boring or unjustified scenes. I give this 8 stars. This is one star more, than I believe it really deserves as a movie, but I added one star for the most controversial and conflicted villian in all SW. This star goes to the actor, he created the best new character in the trilogy."
" Terrible movie
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,3,"Terrible. It had potential, but was not utilized. Could have been 10 times better if the monologue was written correctly."
" A great cinematic experience, but some questionable storytelling decisions.
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,7,"At first glance, this film seemed to solve many of the problems of the prequel trilogy, poor scripting, questionable acting, lots of 'cgi-looking scenes, but was this trade off worth it.
The story is pretty simplistic and follows the same structure to that of A New Hope, with plenty of (if not too many), nostalgia moments. Though this does guarantee a decent story line, it does not make a great one. The plot was both fairly predictable, and had some gaping, unexplained holes, such as how did the First Order come about, how did they build a planet killing weapon so much larger that the Death Stars with far fewer resources? Whatever you thought about the prequels, at least they got the storytelling right, very right in my view. What this Mystery Box method of storytelling that Abrams used did, was make it really difficult for the next director, as they had very little to go off of. This was the main weakness of the filmThe characters were mostly fine and well acted, I particularly liked Rey, Finn and Snoke. The special effects and music were also fantastic. Regarding the world visited, I kind of wished we had some more unique planets, Jakku just being another desert planet and Takodana being very similar to our kind of environments. Again, they could have taken a leaf out of the Prequel's books with far more interesting planets, such as Coruscant, Kamino, Utapau. Another bit of evidence pointing to Abram's dislike for the prequels.Overall, a solid, fun film but one that could and should have been so much more, storytelling wise."
" The Year Is 2015
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,3,"No one has a clue and everyone is bringing in a woman to retread what a man has done. Yes, it is institutional misandry and misogyny.
Instead of film makers and talented folks we have accountants, bean counters of corporate hackery like JJ Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy. So they order a gender switch and make a billion.
Whose fault is it that this gender switch made money and Star Wars is no longer?"
" Star wars episode 7 the force awakens
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,9,"A new order threatens to destroy the New Republic. Finn, Rey and Poe, backed by the Resistance and the Republic, must find a way to stop them and find Luke, the last surviving Jedi."
" Solid Star Wars Film
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,Overall this movie works well for me. It adds fun new hero's and villains and many cool storylines. I think the acting was pretty good overall and I liked the plot line about how the first order was taking control and the resistance seems like the underdogs of the story. I think this is a good Star Wars film and return to the galaxy far far away!
" Did this film even need to be made?
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,2,Completely ruins one of the greatest film series ever to exist.There's no plotToo many characterThe writers are clearly not original Star Wars filmsOnly redeeming point is they got Carrie fisher and Harrison Ford to play a big part
" Stop moaning you sorry wingers.
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,It May not be as good as you would have liked it to be. But the acting is far better than in the first reboot. The effects are awesome and the nostalgia is fun. I love it.
" What a Film
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,Ranking- 8.0 This Film was just great when I watched it I felt soo good about it mostly when I saw Han Solo in it I remember from the other films when he was in it. This film just shines in a way that people would love it. This Film is like Star Wars Episode 4 but a bit different. This is my second favourite Star Wars Film and it was spectacular
" OScar winner.
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,This movie should be nominated for an academy award; compared to what was to come.This felt a little Michael Bay:e somehow. They just copied an old plot and made it prettier. But still this is so much better than what was to come.
" A missed opportunity!
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,5,"Star Wars has always been something that I have enjoyed but seems like its not actually as great as everyone says it is. Episode VII definitely confirmed this for me and reinforced the fact that this whole franchise could be way better. The originals are obviously awesome and the foundation blocks. But every movie following proceeds to tear it all down rather than take it further than before.In Episode VII the creators had a genuine opportunity to do something amazing. They had a chance to create a female lead that all could've looked up to. Some no doubt will look up to her, but Rae was just too perfect to be someone anyone could live up to. I loved the idea of humanising the stormtrooper and using both Rae and Finn's story to tell a story of becoming great through overcoming your past, obstacles and learning from your mistakes. But they really just went and screwed that all up. Rae, instead of learning and growing, seems to walk in every scenario and nail it every time. How can someone relate to that? How can she know how to fly every ship she ever comes across, let alone fix it?The relationship romance angle between Rae and Finn is totally askew too, are they keen? Maybe? Yes? Ok definitely friendzone.....unless wait? Nope!
Up and down and just a complete mess.Obviously with a new Star Wars there needs to be a balance of honouring the old and paving a way forward to build something better. None of this was achieved. They crapped all over the old, by creating people who broke many of the rules within the universe. Throwing old characters in there without any purpose just to give a tip off to the old timers - R2D2 is there but offers next to nothing compared to the other 6 films. Han and Chewy get their lime light but it felt strangely off. And killing Han! This felt really out of line. They seemed to just kill off one the of best characters they had. It would've been better just to leave him be.In terms of paving the way forward - they missed big opportunities for sure. Where were the epic battles of light sabers? This movie was filled with lame plane battle sequences. Don't get me wrong I love watching these, but not for the majority of the action scenes.
The teaser trailer brought more anticipation in Kyolo Ren's new design and the epic battles that awaited. Even Episode 1 got this right when they had their fantastic scenes against Darth Maul. Why not use all your fancy new CGI to make cool Jedi vs Sith battles, instead of wasting it on creating new animals that you can sell as soft toys to younger audiences.This movie was obviously more about making money, there was no clever and well thought out plots. The acting seemed sub par and they just churned out another Hollywood money maker classic! What a shame."
" Never Thought It'd be that Good
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,10,Really Great Movie ! First time watching star wars movies . It's far better than expectation
" Disappointing. (Contains spoiler)
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,3,"This Star Wars has totally killed the series for me, not that I was expecting too much from Disney but at least a minimum. For example, Ray learns to master the force in 2 seconds. The actors are really good, but the script, the story, and all the jokes added to the movie make it disappointing knowing that star wars was never really into jokes or pity for the ennemy. I will never watch one of the disney star wars again, I guess I will stick to my old SW DVD's. Despite all of that I think it is good to put a girl jedi for once, plus the other story's like rogue one or solo are really good."
" Good
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,9,This is a whole new side of Star Wars new characters new story lines it has it all. With some old characters coming back it feels like an old Star Wars movie but some of the story doesn't make sense and why some characters are in the position they are in
" Meh, but not canon.
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,2,"Don't like, glad it's not canon. Prequels are better than sequels"
" CGI & Change the hero to female Plagiarism TRILOGY VS TRILOGY
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,6,"There are two ways to review for Star War Fanatics and for Children
For Children JJ Abrams couldn't come close to Lucas, Adam Driver with or without his helmet is no Darth Vader. There are no Teddy Bear heroes, and the overall story is a bit more convoluted than IV, V, & VI attain a 7.5 for 5-12 yo. 7,8, & 9 5-12 yo 6.As a ""Fanatic"" Bt 40-55....The entire structure of 7, 8, & 9 are borderline plagiarism but outside of Driver being a bad casting it can't replace the childhood memories and merchandising but objectively significantly more tolerable to watch with the kids than 4, 5, & 6 was for our parents.
Plagiarism:
Starts off with a Dark-side massacre on Sand Dune planet
BB8 faster R2D2 without the irritating 3-PO
Heroine is a combination of the Skywalker/Solo team.
Didn't even change Dark Side ""Destroyer"" internal or external design.
Star-Killer-Base lame name and replacement for Death Star....(in addition something that sucks a sun of a Galaxy to nothing will destroy itself and the galaxy before it attacks).
Why was the restored Republic not directly fighting the First Order, no information on the 38 year period between 1984 and 2015...was the first order a break off? Is it a neighboring government that went Dark once the Republic went back to light?
Lastly Vader ""redeemed"" himself so why is Ben Solo meditating over his Helmet.
All movies good or bad after 1977-1994 makes Luke ""Winging"" Skywalker, look like a pathetic last resort Special Education Jedi.
Compared to A New Hope...Ray is the Michael Jordan of the Jedi.
There's no interpersonal tension...
The heroes have evil genetics.....
The main Jedi Training locations have no Technology
The only enjoyable moment I had is watching Ghost Yoda finally tell Skywalker off!!! He looks too much to the future...quitter....total loser!"
" I loved it

" ""It's another Death Star""
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,8,"*Spoilers of the rest of the Trilogy also*
This movie was released 5 1/2 years ago I was 11 and I up to that point I grew up thinking there was never going to be another Star Wars movie. So when Disney bought the franchise for a ridiculous amount of money I was excited. The overall ratings for this movie on the site are overall pretty good, but there is a huge flux of terrible unfair reviews that have spurred from the huge negativity toward all the Star Wars movies produced by Disney.
This movie does not reach the levels of greatness that the OT does, and for some people it is never going to be enough. But not a rehash of A New Hope except of the giant space weapon that blows up (Which is not a positive).
Personally, I really like this movie and since 2014 it has not lost its charm. Rey, Poe, Fin, and BB-8 are great new additions. Hux and Kylo are both menacing villains. Though ROS cheapened Snoke completely. He is still compelling and that it is still Palpatine pulling the strings fits into the plot even if I don't like that he is back. Specifically Snoke takes interest in Rey in the first interaction he mentions her.
One thing looking back on the movie now I think it is terrible that Rey and Finn did not end up together. I my imagination they are together after the 9th movie.
Harrison Ford is great as Han Solo and probably has the strongest return of the main 3 human characters in the OT. Him and Leia are torn apart by Ben's fall to the dark side, but when they are reunited their chemistry is great though in this movie somber. All they wanted to do was be a family again, but that does not happen. Han Solo's death was sad and socking in the theater and is still emotional and sad today. It is the first step of portraying the conflict in Kylo "" I know what I have to do and I don't know if I have the strength to do it"". Clearly he is leaning toward dark at this point and now with the trilogy completed the interaction with his memory of Han Solo is stronger.
This is the not only the first chapter in the arc of Ben Solo, but for both Rey and Fin. Rey in this movie is a scavenger thrown into an adventure is awaiting her families return even though they are long gone. She sees in Han Solo the father she never had, and he is taken from him. Through the whole movie she discovers her new powers that in this movie she is very naive and amused by her own actions. Rey as a character has been over analysed and label a ""Mary Sue"". Which she is successful in everything she does. It is not for no reason, (She is strong with the force), but I think I is a valid complant people have. Though that is not her conflict in the movies it is not about her failure to succeed, but she does fail evermore as the trilogy progresses. Her real struggle is her identity, which is not super consistent throughout the trilogy (mostly with the opposing themes of nobody vs. Palpatine in 8 and 9), but I like the individual story each movie tells.
Fin (FN-2187) sees the faults of the first order and runs, helping Poe in the process and builds a friendship with Poe that continues through all three movies. In this movie he is a runner, but is pulled into the conflict by his connection with Rey (I think it is eveident from the first movie that he is in love with her), maybe it is not mutual. I love Fin his relationship with Rey, is friendship with Poe, and even his brief interactions with BB-8.
Poe I has been my favorite character in the trilogy from the first time I saw this movie, over the 3 movies he does not exhibit too much growth, but he is a ""trigger happy fly boy"" with a lot of talent. He is funny entertaining and he plays off all the characters even the weaker ones like Maz Kanata.
The overall plot is weaker compared to the characters, but is fun. I do not think is is supposed to be real sophisticated it is more entertaining. This movie is well paced with action and has a entertaing lightsaber fight (the weakest of the trilogy) you can not go wrong with a lightsaber fight. And you can also not go wrong with a rebel victory.
This movie is not faultless, there is things I don't like. I think most strong negative opinions are not based of the movie itself, but the impression the internet has left on people. I don't like Maz Kanata, I think she looks weird she is mysterious in a boring way, and is just not likable, but she has an awesome castle with the magic of a room full of aliens from around the galaxy. It is also a little contrived from A New Hope, but also I feel like this movie has so much love for the originals that it almost had to steal something. I would have preferred it was not a giant space ball with the power to destroy a star system that the rebels had to destroy before it destroyed their base.
The movie has looks amazing the effects practical and digital do not disappoint as Star Wars has always been top of the line.
In the Theater I was predictable, Poe was going to destroy Starkiller Base, I was not a long shot that Han Solo was going to die, and I even saw the lightsaber coming in the box (I think the worst scene in the movie, does not work and shows weird vague visions the served no purpose.
Also the acting is good. Anyone who is picking that out as a problem is really fishing for complaints.
It is not my favorite Star Wars movie, probably not even of the ST, it has a good characters, a good story, and is entertaining. This one does not knock it out of the park like the best of the Star Wars movie, but a good Star Wars movie is a pretty great movie. This movie is has nothing major I don't like about it, but since Star Wars is great it is mediocre for Star Wars. (Which is not bad, just with holds it from the top)."
" It is Oscar Worthy
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,2,"Yes, it is that bad!The director and writer are terrible and so obvious. The actors and actresses are weak, but even strong actors and actresses would react badly to the weekly new gender swap.Star Wars RIP"
" Not as great as I hoped
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,7,"I'm a huge fan of Star Wars universe, and like many had very high expectation when looking forward to going to the cinema to view the latest instalment.what I found was sure many of the big budget normalities were in place, such as great cast, great score and great affects, plenty of villains getting blown to bits etc etc, but found the movie lacking.I've just watched it again for what is probably the third or fourth time, and haven't changed my thoughts.great to look at, with some interesting ideas, but pace at times was a little strange, there was some over acting in a few places, and the movie just lacked originality for me.worth a view and certainly belongs in the Star Wars universe but for me sits in bottom four out of the nine movies, which saddens me to say."
" If it ain't broke don't fix it
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,9,"Nearly 40 years after the first ""Star Wars"" hit the big screens, even to this day it is still rewriting the imagination of the world. And I don't mean children or teenagers only, I mean fully functioning adults in their middle ages who are dressing up as their favorite heroes or villains. No other cinematic universe even comes close to Star Wars fanaticism in terms of numbers or just sheer theological offering.These are facts, things which definitely flew around director J. J. Abrams' head when he was told he was to direct the first in a trilogy of sequels to the original three movies. This is not the early 2000s movies, this is the continuation and the expansion of a lore of which every single fanboy on this planet had different visions and were prepared to crucify the director at any single mistake. So, it only makes sense that no big risks were taken--this is the smart choice, the safe choice, and when it comes to Star Wars you can only go safe.""The Force Awakens"", then, follows an outcast with an unknown past but which she and us will discover as we go on that it has ties with the Force. Come on, this is no spoiler. It is obvious and necessary. Newcomer Daisy Ridley portrays Rey--an orphan barely making her living scrounging and refurbishing junk for food. Her only hope is that the parents who abandoned her will one day return. She is this trilogy's Luke Skywalker. The First Order is the new Empire. The villainous leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is Darth Vader--there is even a scene in which he promises to ""finish what you started"" as he looks at Vader's broken helmet. ""The Force Awakens"" would feel more like a remake than a sequel if Abrams and his team of writers didn't do some changes.This movie is all about balance--knowing when to add something to shake the lore and identifying the things which should be left alone. Two decisions stand out. The human paratroopers, particularly a traitorous one, Finn (John Boyega) and the other one is a huge spoiler. Both these changes add a new perspective to the lore even if the first one doesn't rock the casbah too much. Finn plays like an average thoughtful person whose conscience cannot take any more but in conjunction with the rest of the movie, he still feels fresh.Also, this is a 21st Century movie. Which means Hollywood spared no bucks in treating it with the most astute visual technologies. Yet again, in true ""Star Wars"" spirit, the sci-fi effects don't go too crazy. This does not take place in the future. ""Star Wars"" will always be unique in the sense that it happens in ""a galaxy far far away"". It is nor the past, nor the future, but a different dimension. Looking at wide frames of broken spaceships on planets, their empowering giant silhouettes containing masses of dusty tech creates a feeling of anemoia. Another scene, in which the First Order displays their power with a super-weapon which can destroy entire worlds is essentially the movie putting in place Oppenheimer's parable of the ""world destroyer"". Seeing their congregation, their ominous discipline reminds me of the Nazi propaganda movie ""Triumph of the Will"". The scene shows the threat of the First Order better than the initial Star Wars movie did not necessarily because of better effects and presentation, but better historical significance.The first movie in the sequel trilogy is nonetheless a success. J. J. Abrams bit the bullet and released a by-the-book introduction to a new chapter in the Star Wars role. He was smart not taking risks, but even more so by knowing what to add and how to carefully navigate a world which is essentially at the core of pop culture."
" Copycat
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,5,This is just a copycat of a new hope with different characters. The same plot twist and the same desire to kill a main character at about the same time as a new hope did. A poor start to a very poor trilogy.
" Action packed and entertaining
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,9,"I think The Force Awakens is a great film. It has good dialogue, interesting characters, and entertaining storytelling. This movie is very action packed, which is what I love about this movie. I think everyone should give this a try."
" It Is Not As Bad As Everyone Says
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,2,"But read my review first!
I mean yes it sucks and it is a cloned borefest et cetra but frankly it could be worse. The girl could be tattooed and pierced be 2015 jumbo. So at least there is that. It is not like she is pretty or anything but they spared us from a Last Jedi type disaster. So 2 out of 10 instead of 1 out of 10 because it pretty much blows."
" I've got a bad feeling about this.
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,7,"I loved the opening, made me feel like a kid again 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... ' The action sequences are breathtaking from beginning to end so much so that you almost don't have time to realize the lack of originality in the rehashed plot, yet another ""death star"" -couldn't we have had some ""new"" threat to deal with? Did not like the casting of Adam Driver as the bad guy and child of--&-- but did like his modified voice, seeing all the well known actors in assorted cameos took me out of the moment. Liked the two new leads, good chemistry and will work together well in future sequels, particularly the defecting Stormtroopers storyline (Finn) which was really the only original thing going on here.All the plotlines are rehashed, some humour, good end set up for future sequels (which I guess will take place with Ewoks on Endor), Harrison Ford was actually Han Solo not just another grumpy old man which was refreshing, sadness, I still can't believe that happened! Where the hell was Luke all movie, why wasn't he utilized until the last 20 seconds. I'm out of this new Disney franchise."
" Agile, cohesive, dramatic and definitely entertaining, Episode VII brings the franchise to a new generation, proving that the Force does not abandoned Star Wars
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,8,"This seventh episode of the intergalactic saga arrives to expand the universe created so far, bringing new elements and taking advantage of everything that technological evolution can extract from this type of story, besides, of course, bringing the whole atmosphere of the initial trilogy back. to the most excited fans. Of course, the fan of the franchise would already be satisfied just to see familiar faces, like Han Solo, Leia, Chewie and many others, but he will be much happier to receive new characters to fall in love. It is especially exciting to see Harrison Ford and Carrie Fischer together again on the scene, so many years later, as Han Solo and Leah and to see how their relationship has been in the past few decades and their troubled relationship with their son and how it has affected them. Not to mention seeing Solo again aboard the Millenium Falcon, the most incredible old scrap in the galaxies. The introduction of the Millennium Falcon acts differently: it is the rescue of the tone of Episodes IV, V and VI, which would also work with the objective of introducing the figure of the mentor in The Awakening of the Force, an essential element for the Hero's Journey , that the feature film follows to the letter (too much). Fans will also be ecstatic to meet well-known spaceships and robots, such as C-3PO and R2-D2, but they will also be delighted with the new BB-8 which is a mix of R2-D2 and Wall-E in a most beautiful version.The new younger protagonists of the franchise are also fans as well as the public and grew up listening to stories about the legends Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, who fought epic battles against the old Empire. More towards the end of the film, Luke is shown as a practically ancestral figure - the legend becomes reality when he removes his hood and becomes human when his left eye begins to show signs of a tear. We feel the full weight of Star Wars history here, through the iconic character in whose face we see all the memories that return.In fact, it is very good to see the young Englishmen Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as Rey and Finn on the scene. They are characters that generations will love from now on, as it was with the Original Trilogy and not with the New Trilogy. Leah may have been one of the first strong female characters in fictional cinema and it is interesting to see Star Wars once again bringing that aspect to Rey, a natural heroine, strong (physically and mentally), intelligent (knowing how to fight to survive on her home planet , in addition to showing deep knowledge of mechanics, spaceships, and how to fly a spaceship), sensitive and kind-hearted (for example, by not accepting to sell the BB-8 droid, which could earn you food for a long time), agile and does not need to be led or saved by a man, showing it again and again on the scene.Finn is also interesting because he does not want to fight the battles of the First Order, for which he has been trained all his life. Finn knows that not wanting to join them was the right thing to do and he needs to build up the courage to take action that will make him have to flee his former allies. He is the most human in stormtroopers, who, until then, were shown as almost machines, following orders blindly. This confidence and courage that Finn acquires throughout the film is very well explored, including several moments of comic relief. Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron also completes the new team as the best pilot of the Resistance. The actor exudes charisma and stars in an incredible escape sequence from the base of the First Order destined for Jakku to recover the droid and still commands the final attack at the final climax. Lupita Nyong'o - Oscar-winning actress for 12 Years of Slavery - is in a totally digital character, Maz Kanata, but who through movement capture demonstrates great expressiveness, not to mention the voice work.On the side of the First Orde, we have Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a complex and very well developed villain. Unsteady, he wants to follow in Vader's footsteps and fears he won't be as bad as his grandfather was in the past. Ren's figure is already beginning to be worked on in this opening sequence, something that will deepen in the rest of the film. Notice how he crouches down to talk to Poe, a very representative action to put him on the same level as the other characters. The figure of Vader, with slow movements, perfectly controlled is deconstructed, in this man who wants to mirror his grandfather we see impulsiveness, emotions out of control, especially uncertainty. In addition, he was directly responsible for the disappearance of Luke Skywalker, when he turned to the Dark Side of the Force under the influence of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis - underutilized but which should be highlighted later). The conflict with his parents who still believe he has salvation, who could bring their son back to the side of the Light yields great moments, including one that will break the hearts of the public and a certain Wookie. General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) rivals Kylo Ren for command of First Order troops and is also highlighted. The actor created an evident and frightening parallel with Hitler and so many other dictators that we have seen throughout history - his speech on the basis of the First Order is chilling. On the other hand, Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) has a less important and interesting participation than promised.The film is not without its problems, however. There is no great gravity in the actions of the First Order - an organization that despite following in the footsteps of the Empire appears without much explanation, something that must have been thought of in order not to alienate potential new fans too much. And the most serious of them are also derived from this need for repetition. In the original Star Wars and its sequels, there are a number of very hasty and overly innocent solutions to problems much bigger than the protagonists. It is no different here. When the resistance of the New Republic discovers the existence of a weapon capable of making the Death Star pale, it only takes a few minutes and the opinion of a sanitation operator to discover exactly how to destroy it. There is, of course, an attempt to expand the proportions of the threat that this new technology poses to the galaxy. Unlike the Death Star, the Starkiller Base does not need to be close to its target and can reach several points at the same time (how this works or even the question of reloading does not come into question, it is the same as asking why the lightsaber has a limited blade size or because all planets have an atmosphere capable of sustaining human life). The excuse, however, does not work, even characters, such as Poe Dameron, saying that it is not a repetition of what Han, Leia and Luke lived so many years ago.The technical part of this new episode is exquisite. On the soundtrack, Abrams acknowledged that there is no Star Wars without master John Williams. Not only is it amazing to hear the original theme or Leia and Han's, but the new themes also stand out, especially Rey's, at the beginning of the film. As I said before, the new times with visual effects that have an incredible level of realism are very beneficial to the franchise and leave the viewer, finally, immersed in the story. J.J.Abrams and his visual effects team deliver a job far from artificial effects, especially from episodes I, II or III, or even later modifications in the Original Trilogy. The director seems more interested in creating a world that is plausible, although full of creatures of all kinds, ships and everything, than to be placing giant digital creatures everywhere. We do not see an excess of creatures that seem inserted in the scene, especially as seen in episodes II and III, just to justify George Lucas' statements that for the first episodes there would not be enough technology in the past and that he would only adapt the new stories when possible.""The Force Awakens"" by JJ Abrams came to invigorate the franchise with a welcome wave of energy, warmth and excitement after the ill-conceived prequel cycle and delivers exactly what you want: a very fun adventure wrapped in epic mythology, a perfect amount of fan service that triggers your geek synapses, and a final suspense as it paves the way for future sequels. In the end, despite copying A New Hope almost entirely, The Force Awakens manages to acquire a soul of its own, but leaves much to explain about the plot itself, such as the origin of the First Order and the outcome of the original characters. It is cool to create mystery, but it is frustrating to create that expectation in the viewer. The solution is to wait until 2017. It is a safer bet by Disney, which shows all its strength through the work of acting for the entire cast, directed by JJ Abrams, who very well knows what is necessary for us to be involved in the drama displayed on the screen and, of course, out of respect for all mythology created since 1977. Agile, cohesive, dramatic and definitely entertaining, Episode VII brings the franchise to a new generation, proving, once and for all, that the Force does not abandoned Star Wars."
" A remake of a New Hope without the quality.
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,3,JJ Abraham showed that he is truly the copycat king of Hollywood! He has no creativity and simply took a New Hope and slapped new paint on it! However it lacks everything that made a New Hope amazing.
" The new start for star wars 7/10
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,7,"I don't understand all the hate around the film. This movie is what brought back all the excitement and love towards ""star wars"". Fans have been waiting a long time for another film and finally in 2015 it has happened. The actors are fantastic: Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Issac and Adam Driver have become the new stars of the trilogy. The plot happens 30 years after the original story so it leaves a lot of room for new stories and imagination. Unfortunately, this is probably the only good movie in the trilogy. And it is fine enough."
" I couldn't believe my eyes
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,2,"To start with, I am not a Star Wars fan. In fact, this 2020's ""May the Forth"" was the thing that made me watch the movies, so I watched chronologically the first seven movies (and also the animated series!), but I had to stop here.I might be new in this wonderful universe but I'm not dumb enough just to not understand how the force works. You can't awaken it!! And how out of the blue a smuggler girl is the best at everything she does? It makes no sense.I can't imagine how disappointed the fans were back in 2015. It could only be compared to The Phantom Menace. At least, the Episode I shows originality despite of its flaws and tried to tell a story. There is no original idea in Episode VII; everything that happens, has happened before and I don't know if it is fan service or if Disney is playing with the idea of nostalgia among the fans, but it is truly awful that this film follows the events of The Return of the Jedi.I daren't say a thing about the acting, because there is not a worse actor than Hayden Christensen."

" Great start to a new thing based off the old thing
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,8,"Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.I understand that classic Star War fans will hate the new trilogy (and after the Prequels, its understandable that they would be scared), but I was never a big ""Space Wizards"" fan, so adding some action to some fresh characters in the same great universe was the way to go for me.Daisy Ridley and John Boyega do an amazing job, and Adam Driver does a decent job of making me hate Kylo Ren.Giving a new feel on an old formula is honestly an art form, and I think they nailed it.While I wish they had covered more about the Sith during a point of obvious advantage, I'm sure the expanded universe stories will eventually cover the Sith."
" An insult to storytelling... original audiences were blinded by nostalgia and special effects
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,2,"Many people act like this is some kind of generation defining masterpiece for reasons I didn't even quite understand when I left the theater going 'meh'. But as each day went on, the rottenness of the Force Awakens stung my mind more and more until I completely despised it. Well, at least it only kept the status of 'movie of a lifetime' until the equally execrable Avengers Endgame came along. (And it also convinced me that the 1001 Movies to Watch Before You Die book is defective and I will have to make my own).There are many problems with the Force Awakens, too many to name, but I will only mention the ones that bothered me the most, in no particular order:A). The New Republic blows up and nothing changes. Gee, JJ Abrams, I know you didn't want to fall into the same trap that the 'boring' prequels did by including intergalactic politics, but then why are you acting like it's such a catastrophe when the New Republic gets exploded? The heroes aren't affected at all by this event! They just continue on and there are no repercussions whatsoever when what should be the dominant force in the galaxy is wiped out. We still never learn what the New Republic is, or what it's for; and since no one mourns it at the end it must be even more useless than Robert Mueller and Adam Schiff combined, and probably an even bigger waste of taxpayer's dollars.B). What did they do to Han Solo? We know JJ was nostalgic for the days when Han Solo was a cheating rogue, but he should have directed the Solo movie if that's what he wanted to show. What he does in this 'sequel' is retcon Han Solo's ENTIRE character arc from the first Star Wars onward, cheapifying the original trilogy and then not even bothering to give Han any kind of redemption at the end. An ugly shadow of what they would do to Luke in the next movie.C). Little did I know when first watching this that Adam Driver would go on to be the only good thing about this trilogy, but I still don't believe that someone looking like that could be the product of Han and Leia. It's too unbelievable. (By the way, Finn was my favorite character in this one, and I still feel bad for John Boyega the way his character was treated in the next episodes.)D). They actually did Death Star 3. I mean, I have heard and made many good jokes about the fact that the Empire (or First Order, whatever, just someone explain the difference between the two, please.) tried a THIRD time to build a Death Star with the SAME weakness that the other two had! This is just beyond ridiculous-yes, I know it's bigger and solar-powered and destroys more but it's still a Death Star. Giving it another name doesn't hide that fact. On top of that it's the easiest one to blow up! Kind of like the Holiday Special, this is comedy gold but not some kind of thrilling stakes or epic battle.E). The *Resistance*. What are they *resisting*? They are supposed to be the dominant force in the galaxy, how did they lose that? What have these idiotic sickle-snoots been doing, playing video games in their basement and allowing the Empire to come back and build another Death Star? What's going on in this galaxy anyway? Oh, yeah, JJ wanted to redo the original trilogy so he had to make them a rebellion. Right. We can't go around imitating those 'boring' prequels, remember that. Besides, I for one am completely sick of a 'resistance' being in every other sci-fi property. The trope got old I don't even know how long ago.F). Han Solo: ""How to we blow it up? There's always a way to blow these things up."" If even the scriptwriters cannot take this looney-bin plot seriously why should we? It's the same problem I have with many of the Marvel movies.G). ""I'm being pulled towards the light"" Kylo Ren confides in fear. What is this? It's a direct betrayal of the entire moral fabric of Star Wars done with complete ineptness. Oh, sure, it makes Kylo's character more *interesting* because he's a self-doubting villain, but it makes no sense in the context of the series; this isn't some kind real-world drama. It's mythology. The whole point of the Dark Side was that it was ""easier, more seductive...forever will it dominate your destiny"". That's why Luke's journey in the originals was so impactful, he was tempted with having more power, more Force tricks; and anyone with a weaker will would be scrambling to join the Dark Side...But not here. Now the villains are afraid of turning good again for no other apparent reason than they just have good feelings. This cripples the story severely, even more so because Rey doesn't seem to have motivation for being good or evil; she just does whatever she wants and doesn't counterpoint the conflicted Kylo Ren at all. The rest of the trilogy would expand on these themes and as a whole it never really recovered. It shows that JJ and Rian know absolutely nothing about mythology or what makes stories engaging, unlike George Lucas, who made certain things in Star Wars the way they were because he did his research. All that these uneducated Disney buffoons have are lens flares and pretentious movie references. Well, I guess it's not to surprising since many of them didn't even graduate college, who knows how much they actually know.This and the entire sequel trilogy is nothing more than billion-dollar corporate fan fiction. It has just as much claim to being canon as the Star Wars Holiday Special does. (After all, the Holiday Special had all the original actors also...)"

" The Great Start to a Mixed Trilogy
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,8,"The Force Awakens successfully revived Star Wars for many people. It made it good again by capitalizing on things we enjoy from a Star Wars movie. The story is a little similar to A New Hope, however it still has many creative twists and leaves you on a cliffhanger that left fans restless. All the music, acting and effects are incredible. The Force Awakens will always be a top tier Star Wars movie."
" A safe return to the Saga
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,8,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a copy of A New Hope , using a similar plot and plot points of the original Star Wars film. This is hardly a new revelation: critics and fans made that point when it was first released. The plan was to make an entertaining if safe film to win back fans who displeased with the Prequel. The Force Awakens manages this with ease: it was a fun, popcorn film with excellent special effects and action sequences. When compared to J. J. Abrams' Star Wars work Rise of Skywalker, The Force Awakens actually had some build-up and invested in the characters."
" The seek of Map

Meanwhile Han Solo teaches our three protagonists the ropes while revealing a personal tie to Kylo Ren. Force Awakens is a solid enough sequel that is fine, but lacks any real freshness or even an identity. It's all perfectly serviceable, the new actors are relatively likable (Driver in particular is impressive as Kylo Ren) but the problem is that the movie tries to be too much of a reboot than a continuation of Star Wars and even more disappointing, while we want to know more about the new characters and their story arcs, as both an AWOL storm trooper and the son of Leia and Han leading the New Order holds so much potential and yet Force Awakens is too busy ticking the boxes of nostalgia than focusing on it's potentially interesting ideas.**1/2 Out Of 4-(Pretty Good)"

" I enjoyed it
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,8,"What if the original Star Wars was made in 2015? The answer to that question is The Force Awakens. Quite similar in many ways to A New Hope, I really enjoyed this one. We get introduced to some great new characters (Poe is the best) as well as seeing the return of some of our favourite older characters, who are certainly older now. Different enough from ANH to stand on its own, this was a great entry in the series in my opinion that tries to recapture some of the magic from the originals"
" Good start to the new trilogy.
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,9,Another well directed film by JJ Abrams. Not a reboot like Star Trek. Well filmed with a lot of action. Great mix of new characters and old ones. Not without a few issues but overall a good Star Wars movie.

Rogue I was written and produced to answer questions/fill in some gaps between III & IV. VII is just a rework of IV though VI. High octane CGI X-Wing vs. Tie Fighters; Rey lives on a desert planet in an obscure position, has The Force 'strong' within her and develops her skills with the force throughout; The map to Luke is hidden in a droid is a major subplot; Han leads another team to destroy a support position that leads to the death of the Super Death Star; etc...

While the film is fine in total, the script should have perhaps been through a few more redrafts before being put to the big screen. The Force Awakens does manage to re-introduce us back to the world and it does that fairly well but I cannot ignore the blatant problems with the story, one being that the rise of the first order immediately takes away the victory of Return Of The Jedi.

" The force repeats
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,8,"For this movie, lets start by addressing the elephant in the room right away, the fact that this is almost a clone of A New Hope. Yes, I noticed this watching it the first time around, as I'm sure most people did. But you know what, it kept things interesting enough that I was able to overlook that. I loved Poe's character as the snarky but lovable badass rebel. I was really intrigued by Finn being a defective stormtrooper. And Kylo Ren made an awesome introduction as the villain, who was the angry, emotional beast compared to Vader being a cool, unfeeling monster. Of course, Vader will always be number one, but Kylo was really cool. I mean, the way he stopped that laser blast, come on. It doesn't get much more badass than that. BB-8 was a nice new droid addition too, even if he was essentially R2's replacement.But lets talk about Rey. A lot of people hated Rey, calling her a Mary Sue, saying she was just a symbol of female supremacy, etc, etc. I didn't exactly see that. Ok, yes, she had a few Mary Sue moments, but what stops her from being completely Mary Sue is that there was a reason behind everything. How can she speak several languages? The same way many other characters can. How can she pilot a ship? The same way many other people can. How can she make such repairs on the Falcon? She grew up as a scavenger, taking apart ships and stuff, and so has knowledge of things like that, and was probably even taught by the junker she was sold to. How does she know how to fight? She grew up on a harsh planet where if you can't defend yourself, you'll die or get taken advantage of. How can she use the Force so easily? Well, we find out later why she's so strong in RoS, but she's also Force sensitive, she grew up believing the stories about the Jedi and what they were capable of, and so was more open-minded about the Force and what it could do, unlike Luke who was more doubtful, as seen in Empire. She also gained some knowledge, or at least an idea of what Force users were capable of when she invaded Kylo's mind; this was even confirmed in the novel. So you see there's a reason and an explanation for a lot of what she's capable of other than the plot simply demanded it. A Mary Sue can just do anything and everything just because, and with no explanation, like suddenly declaring that they had experience in something to allow them to accomplish a task, when there had never been any indication of this otherwise. Even when she beat Kylo in their fight, there was a reason for it. Kylo, who, don't forget, still hadn't completely his training, was distraught after having killed his father, he was shot by Chewie, he was wounded and tired from fighting Finn, who had also gotten a hit against him, he wasn't trying to kill Rey, while she was going all out and trying to kill him, and she caught him off guard by suddenly channeling the Force.See, plenty of explanation to dismiss the Mary Sue claim. But I also have another theory to explain her strength with the Force, that it was Rey, not Anakin, who the prophecy spoke of. Anakin was the result of Palpatine manipulating the midichlorians to try and create the chosen one for his side, but it was Rey who the prophecy actually spoke of. After all, even though Anakin killed the emperor, balance still wasn't restored, only temporarily stabilized. Palpatine transferred his spirit to his clone body, so the Sith weren't destroyed, and what was left of the Empire rose again as the First Order, and then Kylo appeared. So it was Rey who, when channeling all the past Jedi, actually destroyed the Sith and restored balance to the Force. And with the entire galaxy rising against the First Order and defeating them once and for all, the war truly came to an end and brought peace. So yeah, I didn't have a problem with Rey when taking all these things into account.I also didn't have a problem with Star Killer Base. I know a lot of people complained about it being just another Death Star, but that's not true. That'd be like comparing a nuke to a grenade and calling it just another bomb. And it wasn't a matter of destroying the main reactor and the whole thing goes boom. As a former stormtrooper, Finn played a vital role in taking it down. They weren't even trying to destroy it, just prevent it from using its weapon. It was destroying the part of the base that allowed the weapon to fire the energy it had gathered, which sub-sequentially caused the base to break down. As for the whole map to Skywalker part of the plot, it may have sounded dumb to some people, but not if you actually think about it. Luke didn't disappear but leave behind a map to where he was. He left with the intention to disappear into exile and not be found. Leia knew he went looking for the first Jedi temple, and that's where the map led to, not Luke. It was just called the map to Skywalker because everyone knew, or at least correctly believed, that he would be there. I will admit though, nostalgia likely played a part of me enjoying the movie, but it was still different enough from A New Hope for me to enjoy it as its own thing. But yes, a little more individuality would have been nice."
" Abysmal.
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,1,"Same stuff once again. Also, kills off one of the best characters in the franchise like nothing. Full of annoying new characters. Also, Rey is powerful out of nowhere while others had to train to become powerful."
" The best one thus far, don't get the negative reviews.
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,9,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return Of The Jedi and The Mandalorian (series) it's now time for The Force Awakens. I read tons of reviews stating this one was the worst and now after watching it I wonder why. To me this one was the best Star Wars thus far, equal to The Mandalorian. Everything is just much better, the acting (even from actors that were in the first movie, when you compare them now they're just much better), the special effects (they're just outstanding compared to the early ones), and the story wasn't bad either. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. It's not often you see sequels getting better than the first one but with Star Wars the quality of the movies just improve every time, except for Rogue One that I thought was of lesser quality. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and The Mandalorian, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the nineth movie of eleven plus The Mandalorian in barely four days for me, next one today will be The Last Jedi. I hope it will be of the same quality or even better than The Force Awakens, looking forward to it."
" It's the new hope that's not the new hope.
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,5,"A frantic search for plans concerning an intergalactic super weapon?
An introduction of a young potential hero seemingly stranded on a remote desert planet who as yet has no knowledge of the force?
Sound familiar?
Well hold on there one second, this isn't a review of ""A New Hope"" this is ""The force awakens"" or more accurately it's ""not the new hope""It's not so much of a revisit of Star Wars (a New Hope) which incidentally was added post original release and yes before some of you go apoplectic the original Star Wars was released originally just as that, Star Wars, no subtitle and no episode 4 subtag, that was all added later. What we have here is a very faithful and at times enjoyable retelling of the original story.So be prepared to meet and experience the following characters and scenarios:
The ""not the scene where the super weapon plans are whisked form beneath the not the empires noses to kick things off""
The Not Luke character
The Not Vader character
And the Not the Death Star, devastating intergalactic super weapon that is just handily becoming operational.
As thing unfold we're introduced to the character that is definitely not the wise old sage Obi Wan only for us to witness his untimely demise at the hand of a former acquaintance that is definitely not the Vader character.
There's even time to catch up with previous saga cameos from outside of a new hope so be prepared for the ""Definitely not Yoda"" character and also the ""Not the emperor shadowy appearance"".
Finally round it off with the Not the battle for The Death Star and everybody goes home happy.It's not without originality, enjoyment or the real good feel that you get from the best of these movies, it's more than a lick of paint.Enjoy"
" Made me dizzy with feelings of ADhD
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,6,Never seen such a long movie with so much action jumping around to what seemed like 5 other movies but yet none of them had time to develop in the Star Wars way.. Was like they had 6 directors each do 30 min but none of them were allowed to see any of the other directors 30 min first to be able to bring it together. There was no real begging 3 hours of Middle and no ending. Of course special effects and all that were great but Disney couldn't help but drop the Golden Egg once again. I honestly think just about any average to huge Star Wars fan could of done better job with this movie.. More is not ALWAYS more!
" I finally figured out what went wrong
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,1,"J.J. Abrams was confused about which space movie he was creating. Star Wars is about the inner conflict of the characters. These inner conflicts interact to either bring out the best in each other or the worse. The is always the struggle against darkness. This struggle for the light is the most challenging. Each saga doesn't require a happy ending, but an honest ending reflecting this conflict. In Star Trek the conflict is with society and communal responsibility to the whole.
The only movie that captured the heart of Star Wars is recent years under a Disney is 'Rogue One'. The recent Star Wars are not even loyal to the Disney classics which deal with loss pain and redemption. J.J. Should have watched movies from the Disney Vault Such as 'Bambi' and 'Lion King' which dealt with themes found in classic Star Wars."
" Copy and paste
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,3,"They say copying is the highest form of flattery, but as a fan seeing this movie, all I felt was frustration. If A New Hope were a video game, The Force Awakens would be a new skin update for that video game. The story is beat for beat the exact same, even contriving a new empire out of nowhere. Even more frustrating than no explanation for this ""First Order"" is how it limits where this new trilogy can go. Instead of a new villain or new ideas we get a complete remake. Discount Palpatine, discount Vader even discount Tarkin. Did I mention another death star? Say what you will about the prequels, but at least they tried new things. I only give this 3 stars, because the acting, dialogue and special effects are all great. Oh and old Han Solo."
" Uninspired, Unoriginal.
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,6,"Almost every elements looks so familiar to A New Hope. Too familiar. Everything is just the same. This movie is a cash-grab type of movie. JJ abrams, I hate you."
" Star Wars: The New Generation 🔫
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,7,"I thought this was an Enjoyable watch. The Star Wars World is already a Great setting and it was Fun to watch the New Generation of Characters and their Stories Unfold. Finn, Rey, Poe and Kylo Ren were Great Additions to this Establishment.New Additions:° The First Order: Similar to the Galactic Empire° The Resistance: Opposition to The First Order° Snoke: Supreme Leader of the First Order° Kylo Ren: Master of The Knights of Ren° General Hux: General of the First Order° Captain Phasma: Commander of the Storm Troopers° Rey: A scavenger on the Planet Jakku° Finn: A First Order Stormtrooper° Poe: A Resistance Pilot
Also, The Super weapon scene was Great.It was a Fun Adventure and I especially liked Kylo Ren, what a Great Character. The Story was Nice too, and it had some of the Old Crew for the Older Generation of Star Wars As well."

I didn't like what they did to my favorite franchise they added all these characters I don't know and don't wanna know and it had nothing that I wanted in a storie.

" The Force brings a new hope
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"The first line in this movie is ""This will begin to make things right."" I feel like that's a jab at the prequels. ""Hey, we know the prequels were awful, but this new movie will begin to make things right."" Probably not intentional, but clever nonetheless. My goodness, this movie is so well done! The parallels and metaphors are so cleverly written. Even if you haven't seen any Star Wars movies before, you can watch this as a standalone. Will you get more out of it if you've seen the original trilogy? Of course. Is it essential viewing before going into this one? No. The plot does at times feel ""Been there, seen that,"" because it is essentially a remake of A New Hope. However, there's enough new bits in the story that left me satisfied. The practical effects are so well done, and the very little CGI in the movie looks more realistic than the prequels ever did. There's an important message in the movie, and the characters are relatable. Unlike some of the characters in the prequels, you care about what happens to these new characters. They're acting is great, and the classic actors still feel like their characters. Harrison Ford is still great with the zingers, and C-3PO is still the worrisome robot we all love. J. J. Abrams has restored what we all love about Star Wars. Even before the classic characters show up, it still feels like a Star Wars movie. If the upcoming films are even 1/4 as good as this was, there's a new hope for the Star Wars franchise.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"
" Unoriginal Soft Reboot
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,3,"The Force Awakens is about as original as Jurassic World. The characters, worlds, and plot are ripoffs of the original Star Wars. The only difference is that the writing is worse. Whereas in A New Hope Han talks down to Luke (""Who's gonna fly it, kid? You?""), in The Force Awakens Rey one-ups Han at fixing his own ship. When a new character one-ups a legacy character, it is a sign of poor writing.
Rey is an expert pilot who speaks every language, uses the Force without training, and wins a duel the first time she picks up a lightsaber. Her character is a cardboard cutout without any weaknesses or growth."
" Did you like A New Hope?
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,5,"This film is effectively just A New Hope but with new characters. The film has some interesting aspects, such as Finn being a stormtrooper, but it fails in its execution of that. If Finn was a stormtrooper with potential to change, why does the last quarter of the film see the resistance mercilessly murdering them by the dozens, even hundreds?Though, there's some pretty cool lightsaber combat in this film and overall it doesn't do anything terribly wrong. I'd rate it a 6/10 if it could stand by its own merits, but like I said, it's just A New Hope packaged differently."
" More of a reboot than a sequel
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,6,"Everything is back to square one. The empire is back. The rebels are back. Leia is still the rebel leader. Han went back to being a smuggler. The Jedi are still extinct. They just made a New Hope again. This is poor story telling. They should have spent more time on the script, but apparently Disney didn't want to invest in that kind of quality. It's a shame."
" Have they even watched the previous ones?
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,1,"I have watched all star wars movies many times. When I'm posting this episode IX is already out.
There are many many things off about this film that makes me angry. If you want to build a star wars movie at least sit and watch 6 movies before. For example the light sabre of luke skywalker is not the same as the one anikan used. That sabre got lost and luke made a new one. It is just one example of many and it is clear in previous films.
I think it was a mockery to the franchise and the creators went to destroy star wars."

",2020-03-19 00:00:00,4,"That is all it was a remake of the original trilogy, Not only this movie but all the so called sequel trilogy , but it isn't an actual remake so they undo everything from the original to do it again in these sequels , but hey they have a good CGI oooohhh.If you loved the original avoid this at all coasts.Anything else these movies try to do that isn't part of the original ends up to break the roles of the originals, It is like saying you couldn't do that because you are lame we are much cooler we can do anything we want .My problem with this movie isn't that it is bad it is average, but that it so plainly steal its story from episode four that i couldn't bring my self to watch it without stooping every 5 minutes to say "" wasn't this thing in episode four"" which ended up making the movie so distracting and out of focus.4/10 for copying episode 4"

" Completely ruined Star Wars story
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,1,"I couldn't believe the amount of copying (from old movies) done here. It's COMPLETELY the same as original one!
How in the world could you come up with that story? I mean, even a piece of wood would made a better, original story. Character development is non existent, acting is below mediocre, actors themselves pretty forgettable.
And Kylo Ren dude (he does act OK in other movies), but here? C'mon, remember Vader and Darth Maul? These guys were scary, this is just an emo kid angry at his family a bit. Makes me really sad you made money for, let's be honest, stolen/copied (bought if you like), already used story.
This is an insult to all viewers, and especially fans I'd say (I'm not a huge fan myself, just a regular guy who liked the story and development before, even with flaws they had).
And yes, great work on shutting down Lucas Arts, another team that gave us good times, on contrary to what we have now."
" A lot better than other people are saying.
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,9,"After seeing The Rise of Skywalker, I've decided to review the sequel trilogy, starting with this film, which had gotten a lot of flak for being a rip-off of the Original Trilogy.But here's the crazy bit. I didn't mind it at all and still thought the movie was still great to this day.PROS: I honestly loved the way Rey was set up here. Unlike Luke, Rey grew up alone despite being on a desert planet. She also had to fend for herself, she's an underdog, and she's an active protatonist. As such, I legitimately cared for her as a character.However, the standout is definitely Adam Driver, who is unpredictable, violent, and conflicted, which is the opposite of Darth Vader. The other characters are great as well, including Poe Dameron and Finn. And Luke's appearance in the end was still nice to see.The story, despite being nearly the same as A New Hope, I didn't mind as much and thought it was good for what it was, which was to reintroduce us to Star Wars after 10 Years.The Effects are REALLY PHOTO-REALISTIC here and the Camerawork is some of the best camerawork I've seen in a Star Wars film (barring Rogue One).CONS: The only ones I can think off is Finn being knocked out from the final fight really quickly, the fact that Rey knew how to fly the Falcon really easily, and that's it.Overall, the film is still just as good as I first saw it, despite some problems.9/10"

" Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens( review
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,8,"For several years, I lived and breathed Star Wars. When Episode I came out, my then-boyfriend (now husband) and I were stoked for it. We drove to London to see it in May, rather than wait until August when it opened in Germany. We got the last two tickets for the Royal Box at the Odeon! We loved the film.But it dawned on us when we saw it again at the German premiere just how much it had let us down. Within a very short time, my interest in Star Wars just died. We watched the next two movies the way we'd watch other blockbusters - we just weren't invested anymore.We thought our Star Wars days were behind us, and we were mildly hopeful for The Force Awakens. We took our kids to see it on opening weekend. I remember walking away with the distinct feeling that this was Star Wars again, but it didn't fully hit me until rewatching the movie just how much I loved it. We all loved it.I remember walking away with the distinct feeling that this was Star Wars again . . .I loved all of them almost equally at first. Rey is one of my favorite female characters ever. I knew I'd love Finn and Poe. What totally surprised me, though, was how much I loved Kylo Ren.I never fall for the baddies. In trailers, I saw pictures of him but forgot him immediately - a faceless badass villain to go on boys' pyjamas. But he turned out to be a very complex character that truly drew me in in a way that other villains never do.Visually, he's cool to draw - from his amazing costume with long, trailing cloth to his jug ears. All the main characters are fun to draw. The costumes of Kylo Ren and Rey just scream Art Nouveau for me, so they got the treatment.
Kylo Ren.
Finn.
Poe.What's the story behind your site name, GoldSeven?It's named after a pilot character who defects from the Empire and joins the Gold Squadron. She flew as Gold Seven. She's in the Y-wing you see flying away from the exploding Death Star. Her name was Samica Trey, and she still holds a very special place in my heart"

",2020-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Don't mind the 4K negative reviews on here. This was a great continuation of the star wars universe. J.J. Abrams revitalized Star Trek, and he worked his magic again on Star Wars. How anyone could give a movie with Han Solo in it a 1/10 is just madness."
" What a comeback!
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,9,"It's not difficult to see why Star Wars was dying. The prequels were never going to capture any child's imagination in the same way as the originals - full of wooden characters, trade negotiations and uninspired cgi overload. There were features of interest, but Star Wars was on the edge of death.Episode VII however relaunches the franchise with style, breathing new life into it. Our new lead characters are instantly engaging and likeable: Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) are charismatic and inspiring (in all the ways Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman weren't).The story is fast paced and exciting, showcasing a galaxy far far away without overdoing it. It's basically the plot of a New Hope but on a bigger scale but this keeps things safe and there's enough twists on the story to keep it fresh and exciting.The only real weakness is the villains - shouty holographic Snoke is about as far from scary as you can get, General Hux is the least threatening villain yet, and Kylo Ren.... oh dear. He had me intrigued for the first half, but once the mask was off and it was revealed we were dealing with a whiny emo teenager, it's just impossible to take him seriously. At the very least, Adam Driver makes something of it and we at least get some actual acting rather than Anakin whining about sand again.The strength of the film is in its heroes though and our three new leads are joined by some old friends too. Seeing Leia, Chewbacca and C3P0 (if you recognise him) is great, but the real star of the film is Harrison Ford - Han Solo's swansong is a worthy one and his death is possibly the saddest scene in all of Star Wars.In short, JJ Abrams' vision of Star Wars is just too cool and exciting to ignore, and with this film he just saved an entire franchise."
" Rey is a Mary Sue, A new hope but worse.
",2020-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Movie starts of great with Finn realizes the terror of the first order after his friend dies and they kill a bunch of innocent people. And Poe being a cool han solo type character who finn needs to get off the space shuttle fo the first order. There dynamic with one another is amazing, the problem is as soon as the reach Jakku, Poe is booted out the movie until the third act, to make place for Rey. Rey is mary sue ans legitamately has no real flaws at all. She does anything right and behaves like the perfect angel. She cries over han solo death after only saying less than 100 words to him, yet in that time she thought of him as a father. Rey mary sue archetype is first shwon when some buyer wants to buy a droid she just meet for a lot of money, and her beeing a poor teenage says no. I think the scene would be much more interesting if she had said yes. Overall I just think shes is a pretty boring character and the force skills she uses in this movie makes her to op, her beating kylo ren was garbage. Han solo and kylo ren were great in this movie. Han giving up on his rightoues way, going back to pre New Hope Han due to his son going to the dark sides. Then there kylo ren who we don't know why he turned to the dark side, but is so cool. Hes struggling with the light side a little bit, and acts like his age. His fight was Rey and FInn were great, and his last words with his father were good too. ""I know whats the right thing to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it""."" I do wish Han Solo got to meet luke again though..:(
This movie is basically a new hope but worse.

" Disney what have you done?
",2020-02-28 00:00:00,1,There are so many wrong things in this movie that it really makes me wonder if the writers have ever watched the previous 6 movies. I mean come on...In episode 6 the rebels won the war and destroyed the Empire. We saw the people happy in the whole galaxy. I can understand that sith could return somehow but on the other hand it makes no sense that Luke did nothing to protect the galaxy from a feature threat. He should have built a Jedi academy and first of all train his sister. It makes no sense that Ben Solo wasn't protected from turning to dark side by him and his parents. Not only that but Kylo Ren was pathetic and weak. Killing his dad didn't make sense and it wasn't the end the most beloved character in star wars saga deserved. And last I have to speak about Rey. Enough with the macho women for no reason in movies already. She was really boring as a character and felt like thrown to the movie from out of nowhere. Disney also keep a note. Lightsaber is not a toy anyone can hold. The only chance someone will like this movie is if he hasn't watched the previous star wars movies. Otherwise he will be mad about this disgrase. George Lucas how could you let this happen? :(

I watch Star Wars to be entertained in only the most superficial way... otherwise I wouldn't be able to re-watch the original trilogy. None of this was ever meant to be taken seriously.

They were never, ever going to be as good as the first ones - but this is nowhere near as bad as the second set, either. There is no doubt that ""Kylo Ren"" is about as scary as a custard but the rebel team of Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac (OK, BB-8 is annoying) do have a semblance of chemistry between them that works. JJ Abrams hasn't the imagination of George Lucas, but then nobody has... This is a fun, action adventure that trades on it's provenance for sure, but it is still enjoyable enough to watch with some good production values, SFX, action scenes and a decent enough script. It's fine."

" The Trilogy that Never Should Have Happened
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,5,"The movie looks good visually and is well acted. That is the extent of its saving grace. This movie is almost entirely a remake of A New Hope. Instead of the Rebels vs the Empire, you have the Resistance vs the First Order. Instead of the Death Star, you have Starkiller. The names aren't even original. You have the newbie to the force standing up to the seasoned villain. The only difference is that Rey is exceptionally good at the force and fighting with a lightsaber right off the bat. What? It took Luke, the greatest Jedi of all time, 3 movies to develop the amount of skill she has. This is explained, albeit poorly, in Rise of Skywalker. Her first use of the force is a freaking Jedi mind trick? Talk about ridiculous.A new trilogy could have taken two possible directions. It could haven followed shortly after Return of the Jedi with new actors, or gone to a different time/place in the galaxy with entirely new characters. Instead they tried to walk some weird middle road where they brought back everyone's favorite characters and made them all freaking losers. Han Solo is killed off in the most ridiculous possible way. He survives attacking two different Death Stars just to get shanked by his whiny emo kid? Wow.Disney really screwed up here, these movies never should have happened. I actually liked Rise of Skywalker because it attempted to fix all of the mistakes in 7 and 8."
" Wouldn't he know where Luke Skywalker was on the island since he was actually there on the island with him and fled the island?
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,3,Wouldn't he know where Luke Skywalker was on the island since he was actually there on the island with him and fled the island? Why did he need the drone if he was actually on the island he should've known where it was
" It's not that bad
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,7,"I can understand the frustration of people watching this and realising that it's just a remake of the original film. However, I personally think giving this film 1s and 2s out of 10 is ridiculous. It really isn't that bad. There are some good battles in there that are hard to take your eyes off, they supplemented the new characters well with some of the old ones and did touch on the old films very nicely I thought"
" Only Watched By Rubberneckers
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,2,"This is a calamity,a disaster, a car wreck that disrespects Star Wars, logic, cinema and art and forgets that the rebels won and defeated the empire.Anyone watching this is telling Leia, Han and Luke they are morons for claiming victory and celebrating at the end of Episode VI."
" An SJW push disguised as a Star Wars movie
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,2,"How did we get here? In Episode 6, the rebels were winning. The Empire was breaking and the emperor was (temporarily) gone. (Note: If you read the books and the comics, you would understand what i mean by ""temporarily"").This is Kathleen Kennedy's ""The Force is Female"" nonesense. The problem, with this whole story is you have a being, with Force abilities, who (with NO training) just JUMPS into being a Jedi with abilities. To anyone who's read cannon books, this is a major WTF?!?!? moment because other jedi/sith had to ""earn"" their way into having abilities. Rei just gets a handle, with no training, and is just doing it.And what is this, the most DRIVEN individual (in Star Wars history) has gone off to hide on some planet? Sorry, no, but that is NOT who Luke Skywalker is/was, they have ruined his story/legacy with this garbage writing.Han Solo loses the Millennium Falcon? Are they nuts or high or stupid? That ship was everything to Han & Chewie, they would have never lost it.Can you see the pattern here? They wrote the leading male ""hero"" role, from the jump to be incompetent losers who have just screwed everything up. Thankfully, the droids have no sexual orientation and they were spared this SJW stupidity.The next movie is an even worse failure. People you have to understand, the only ""real"" reason these movies made money was because of the legacy Star Wars had ingrained into our culture.A monkey could have wrote the script and it would have made money. And, honestly, i could have written a better script that would have been more ""legacy"" where the ball was handed over to a new generation without this ignorance."
" Very good movie and work...
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,10,The movie has a good and funny history and I like too much the return of the héroes like Han Solo and more.
" Disappointing
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,6,"Very disappointed with this sequel to the classic trilogy, including the prequels."
" It's Already Been Done
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,3,"The first time I saw this, it was called The Original Trilogy.Orphan on a desert planet. Evil guy dressed in black with a scary helmet. Death Star like planet with the capability to destroy other planets. ""I'm your father"" scene on unnecessarily high precipice. Incredibly outnumbered band of rag-tag rebels attack and destroy Death Star like planet. Main protagonists goes to secluded place to learn the ways of the Force from reclusive Jedi.The only thing missing was the 20th Century Fox intro. Hmm...Maybe that has something to do with it?"
" A Disney Lie: Nostalgia
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,3,"This movie is one of the most hyped movies in the cinema history. But why? Because of this marketing policy ""Nostalgia"". This movie should have told the story of Luke, Leia and Han but instead Disney used them just to market these new characters. No one cares about Rey. We wanted to see Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia. This movie is just a remade A New Hope. Why? Because of lazy writing and nostalgia marketting. There is zero character development. Rey is just perfect at everything. She can fly the Millenium Falcon and even repair it. The ending of the movie is just so ridiculous. They introduce the character Kylo Ren as the son of two legends, Han Solo and Princess Leia, he is also trained in the ways of the force by Luke Skywalker and then the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke. But somehow Rey who is just a force sensetive girl and she is also untrained, she haven't even held a lightsaber in her life defeats Kylo Ren. Where is the logic? Even the chosen one Anakin Skywalker had to be trained to become a jedi. Whatever at least the film had these mystery boxes for us to be hyped for the upcoming movie."
" Yep Star Wars
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,Decent action movie but I guess if you are a huge Star Wars fan you thought this was the best thing since Jedi. To me they all feel kind of the same and there isn't much difference here.
" I lasted 10-15 minutes
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,2,"I could only tolerate 10 15 minutes of this reboot. Clearly Disney decided to reboot and retread the whole thing so they can make Star Wars for their pre-teen target market.In the ten minutes I watched a girl in a desert who shows her face and legs and has them exposed to the sun shows no tan, a clone stormtrooper is black so does not look like the original copy, the same stormtrooper has a mark on his helmet because audience is too stupid to follow him or know what's what and needs thing explained to them, there is a sith with powers of the dark side, but he needs to physically torture a pilot, the said pilot is the best in the resistance but is left unguarded and best of all they put a message in a droid.I did not even get into the whole deal about how the dark side is in charge again when they had lost at the end of Episode VI!!"
" Why So Much Hate?
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,10,"It's a very sad thing indeed when people who call themselves 'fans' set out to do nothing but hate. I loved this movie the moment I saw it and I still love it today, putting it right under 'The Empire Strikes Back' on my list of Star Wars movies in order from favorite to least favorite. I get that some people don't like the idea of a woman Jedi hero or a black stormtrooper turned hero or even a movie that uses nostalgia to tell our beloved story from A New Hope in a new way. But ya'll are idiots. This film was well made, well acted, and beautifully crafted from start to finish. While I appreciated the prequels when they came out, they were nothing compared to the originals. This movie brought Star Wars back into my life in a way it hadn't been since Return of the Jedi came out on video. Thank you, JJ Abrams and Disney, for giving me my childhood back!"
" Episode IV on steroids
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,4,"This was a good movie, only shame was that it has been already done years ago. Nothing really changes, it's basically episode IV remastered. I wonder what they'll do whenever they want to refilm the first trilogy."
" Pretty sure I saw this DONE BETTER back in 1977
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,3,"Well, I didn't, I was born in '77 but I think you get my point.
I was REALLY hopeful that we'd get a continuation of the magnificent original trilogy. That Disney would build on the lore and expand the wondrous universe built by George Lucas.
Instead we got a soft reboot leading us into absolute misery. J. J. Plagerism started the ball rolling under the watchful eye of Kuntline Kennedy.
How can either be considered ""professionals"" yet create this abomination?"
" An excercise in misleading the public
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,2,"Te movie was an insult to the intelligence of human kind. What a garbage movie. It felt like a comedy the way they acted, and the dialog was soo sooo narrow and empty. I feel really tricked by the ammount of hipe it got. In the end the only thing it got was allot of refferences, and nostalgia, but they even didnt do that right. The most shocking part is that it seems like people are affeaid to say they dont like it because it is star wars. This aint star wars, this is a garbage fire, star wars are good movies."
" Very much enjoyed the movie
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,7,"Although sometimes I wonder if we're so attached to the series that we can overlook a lot of things. I think people who grew up with the series would rate most as at minimum ""Watchable"". Having said that, did not really like I and II very much but Force Awakens was great. I totally Love BB8, he (she?) is the best. Good acting and good plot line. Good combination of drama/SPX/action."
" Sleeper
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,2,That's right. I fell asleep in the movie theater even though it was a ridiculously loud movie. Save your money at watch at home.
" It's not the best, but there's worse.
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,4,"Not the best shot at a Star Wars movie, but to put it short and sweet:Action: Alright. Not that bad. Conveyed good power and carnage.Characters: Could be better. They're just kind of awkward.Story: Not too shabby."
" The Movie That Made Me Not Be A Star Trek Fan Anymore
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,2,The Mary Sue running around in this movie being all magical and arrogant is so stupid. How does JJ pick her for his love life or movie???I am not a conspiracy theorist but did JJ really pick Johnson to further destroy Star Wars with The Last Jedi just to make himself look better??
" Episode IV Redux
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,7,"My review of this entry is simple, it is a New Hope redone with new characters and a couple of different twists. Does this make it bad? No. There is no such thing as a bad Star Wars film. The problem with the lifelong fans, of which I am, I was four when A New Hope was released, is that they want to recapture the awe and splendor that they experienced when Star Wars first came out. It will never happen people."
" Rey Mysterious
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,6,"Ahead of watching Episode IX at the cinema, I decided to rewatch the previous two film from this trilogy as preparation. Interestingly, I found that though my recollection of this film was that I enjoyed it, and that it was still the case, it does feel like a basic retread of the formula from the original trilogy.Rey (Daisy Ridley) a scavenger on the desert planet Jakku, and Finn (John Boyega) a deserting Stormtrooper, escape the planet on an abandoned Millennium Falcon with a plan to return a droid, BB-8, to his rightful place in the Resistance. Though the Empire fell, the First Order rose in their place (and with their clothes) led by a Sith Lord, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and his mysterious master, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis).Technically, the films marvellous. CGI is second to none, the scope of the planets, the backdrops of the destroyed Star Destroyers. I like all the performances, and all the new characters (with perhaps the exception of Maz Kanata who I don't feel was an interesting design or necessary to have as a motion capture character - I'd rather have just seen Lupita Nyong'o on screen).I mean, it's a film that I like, rather than love. It's a nostalgic bump of childhood, solid but not exceptional. Its conclusion is almost identical to the end of ""Return of the Jedi"". It has a painful sacrifice, like ""A New Hope"". It has a gun capable of destroying world, a droid with vital information in it. I feel, especially having watched Episode VIII again too, like it's disappointingly unwilling to do anything new with the universe at its disposal - so we're left with a film that's consistently OK, but never great."
" ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,7,"I Liked it so much when it first came out but seeing how the trilogy ended changes my point of view about this movie , it's still an enjoyable movie tho."
" Star Wars is Back
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,10,"I sat with anticipation, the likes of which I had not felt since the premiere of the Special Edition or Episode I when I was in Middle and High School. The marketing had worked its magic on me and transported me into the haze of nostalgia to prime me for, what I hoped would be, the second coming of Star Wars, delivering us from the wasteland of the prequels which we had been languishing within.Walking out of the theater, I couldn't have been happier. Sure there are little things here and there that I didn't care for but on the whole, everything I love about Star Wars was back.In my review of ""The Last Jedi"" I talk about how much I love that film because it ""brought the force back into Star Wars."" I lament the way that the force is relegated to the role of superpower in the prequels and comment that we get hints of the forces return to prominence in ""The Force Awakens."" Having revisited this film more recently, now, I realize that ""The Force Awakens"" had already done this and brought life back into the franchise.The spirit of Star Wars was lost in the prequel years. Films that had been about the choice between good and evil, the seduction of darkness, and the redemptive power of light became about Visual Effects Fireworks displays, convoluted political plots, and lightsaber fetish inspired dancing. The central questions of the first trilogy are questions of character and motivation not playing plot fill-in-the-blanks or fan service.""The Force Awakens"" returns us to form, where the light vs. dark questions and story of the force are once again central. The turning point of the lightsaber fight at the end of the film turns not on a loss of temper, a flourish of the sword, or a quick thinking characters ideas. It turns, instead, on the moment wherein Rey (Daisy Ridley, ""Murder on the Orient Express"") begins to believe that if she stands up for the light, the light will empower her to defeat Ren (Adam Driver, ""Marriage Story"").I will forgive much of a film for the sake that it has gotten this correct. Luckily, there isn't much for me to forgive because the film is so joyfully and beautifully made.The new characters are great and recapture the young spirit of the originals. We forget that the mains in ""A New Hope"" were kids when they made those movies (Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford) and their youth is apparent in the way they speak to each other, the joking together they engage in, and the spirit of adventure they all share. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega (""Pacific Rim: Uprising""), and Oscar Isaac (""Ex Machina"") are that youth, excitement, zeal, and adventure in this film. Watching Rey and Finn go back and forth about holding hands and who knows more than the other is very reminiscent of Han and Leia. Poe teaching Finn to shoot in the TIE fighter feels like Luke and Han shooting down TIEs in the Millennium Falcon. Rey, longing for meaning and family feels a lot like Luke longing for adventure.For many, these similarities are a negative. They see ""Force Awakens"" as a copy of ""A New Hope."" A lesser copy. I don't see it that way at all. To me, this is a breath of fresh air.On the surface, I can understand how some people, without thinking all that deeply about the subject or perhaps simply parroting reviews they watched online, might see the films as being extremely similar.After all, the protagonists in both films begin on desert planets, a droid holds a secret piece of information in both, they visit a wretched hive of scum and villainy, a super-weapon blows up some planets, the super weapon is destroyed by a single fighter, and a mentor is sacrificed within site of the one they are mentoring. There are loads more correlations but I want to point out that they are all similar only on the surface. Almost in every case, the meanings behind these things are different.Rey may be on a desert planet, but unlike Luke, who wants desperately to get away, she wants to stay. Even once she leaves she wants to go back. Her motivation is exactly the opposite of Luke's and people have the audacity to say that it's basically the same. I could go down the line of the objections pointing out how all of them are simply surface similarity, and if someone wants me to do that, I suppose I could on the podcast, but I don't want to belabor my point here.Let's just say that after watching it over and over, ""The Force Awakens"" is simultaneously reminiscent of the original trilogy but presents similar themes and ideas in new ways. To me, that is a remarkable accomplishment for a filmmaker, especially when considering the size and importance of this film to the studio making it.I simply don't understand how people who loved the original trilogy can watch this film and not like it. It is EXACTLY what this sequel should have been.Except for the rathtars. That sequence blew."
" A decent Star Wars film
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,7,"When this film first released I would have rated it a 9, mostly out of the exhilaration of a new Star Wars film being released. However, after sitting on it for a few years, I believe it deserves a 7. The film follows the first Star Wars film too closely and feels like a rehash of things we have already experienced. However, with solid acting, decent to great characters (Kylo Ren), and having excellent effects, the film is entertaining enough to rewatch (unlike a later entry into the series)."
" A review from someone who missed the original six Movies
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,9,"First ever review on IMDB after so many years.In preparation for the watching The Rise of Skywalker, I've spent the last two weeks watching all the Star Wars movies relevant to The Rise of Skywalker.The order of watching was as follows:Episode IV: A New Hope (1977)
Rogue One (2016)
Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)
Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)
Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)
Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)
Solo (2018)
Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)
Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)
Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)Still to watch
Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)The force awakens is the BEST of the bunch. To be fair it felt like a do-over of the original, breeding in new blood and I guess that's what it was.However the special effects, the comedy, the chemistry between characters, the reunions; and these new kids did a stellar job.I loved this Star Wars movie very entertaining.The new villains were interesting but I didn't care too much for them honestly.The best bits were Rey and Finn. Just a charismatic as Hans and Luke."
" Cut and paste
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,5,"A shameless regurgitation of a new hope, with a Droid carrying around an important bit of information and anything else Jar Jar abrahms could copy from Lucas. No story to carry on the trilogy this kicks off, and worst the most dumbest and needless and senseless way of wasting our true characters from the original trilogy. We never got at least one damn scene with all our beloved heroes. Truly disappointing: this franchise is now damaged forever."
" A Great Star Wars Movie!
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Firstly it's obvious most people rating this film 1-2 stars are simply just saying ""tHiS iS a ReBoOt gO wAtCh tHe OrIgiNaL hurrr durrr"". It's simply blind hatred and it's clear most haven't seen THIS movie! Don't listen to the blind hate reviews!! They all have nostalgia goggles on from the original Star Wars movies! It's such a shame cuz I imagine it's angry 50 year olds just hate bombing the reviews cuz they have nothing better to do with their day lmfao.I put off watching this movie for so long because of all the negative reviews people were leaving, but man have I missed out. The first time I saw this movie was today on Disney+ January 2020, so 5 years after release. The only reason I decided to watch it was because now that Rise of Skywalker is out I figured it'd be a good time to watch the new trilogy. I LOVE all the Star Wars movies, the original 3 ep 4-6, + the new eps they made at the beginning of the century ep 1-3. IMO all the movies have been great sci-fi/action movies.Star Wars: The Force Awakens is another great sci-fi/action movie. I went into this with an open mind, not trying to look for comparisons between this movie and the original ""a new hope."" If you go into this movie looking to compare every single scene between the 2 movies you will probably not like this movie because you will nit-pick every single scene! But if you're like me and just turn your brain off and just enjoy the show the movie is very thoroughly entertaining! Tons of action and great story development.I'm 24 years old and found this movie very entertaining, and please understand I found the original Star Wars movies equally as entertaining when I was a little kid even though others would say they're boring. Also I didn't feel like they ""shove"" the woman main character into our faces as many others have stated. I usually hate when they force women/minorities into major roles of tv/movies simply to say ""look a woman could do this too"" or ""look this woman is so strong & independent just like a man"". This movie wasn't that. The female did a great job as well as Fin the black guy, they played their roles without  garbage being shoved down our throats.Finally the reason I wrote this review is to hopefully sway someone to watch this movie who was on the fence just like me. Please don't listen to the 1-2 star ratings. Sure some people may have actually hated the movie that much, but if you scroll through enough you will see that most super low ratings are just saying, ""screw this movie, watch the original"" lmfao, very constructive guys. It's a shame because if this movie wasn't review bombed it would definitely be a 9+ rating on IMDB and that's FACTS!"
" Welcome Back, Star Wars
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,10,"A perfectly balanced blend of charming love-letter to the style and structure of the original trilogy, infused with an emphatic freshness of humour and new ideas, creates what could be argued to be the purest straight Star Wars film of the entire saga. Paced to perfection as it hits the familiar narrative beats we come to expect, Awakens is alive with the over-the-top action and stirring sentimentality of the films we grew up with while also casting very modern shadow of intrigue and mystery that sets the mind whirring with possibilities as the story moves forward; a shot of pure adrenaline to the heart of the Star Wars fan in all of us that had laid dormant for ten years since Lucas completed his prequel trilogy."
" Very bad movie
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,4,"The movie is made using a disgustingly boring recipe.
After watching the other classic 6 episodes as well as Solo and Rogue One, this is utter commercial crap"
" The Force Awakens is a reboot of A New Hope
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,8,"The Force Awakens is the best of the sequel trilogy, in my opinion. This doesn't take away from the fact that this movie is essentially A New Hope reboot...There are several similarities between the two movies (Planet killing weapon, a legend dies, desert dweller becomes jedi, etc.) that made the film feel oddly familiar.While the movie is not necessarily ""bad"" per se, it is the mess of the next two movies that tarnish the trilogy. By judging this movie on its own merits, The Force Awakens is a fun adventure movie, it just lacks originality. I still enjoyed it just recognized that it kinda felt like a familiar movie.And for that, the film gets a 8/10."
" Remake
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,2,Nothing new to see here. Go watch the original trilogy

Is it because you picked them up at discount alley???"
" Just another death star - boring
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,4,"This episode seems to have used the same storybooks from previous episodes. Only some minor modifications and even worse - a civilization capable to build a high tech weapon is not able to secure it with the simplest methods. Being a little unrealistic is of course a privilege of Science Fiction but this ... a single person could switch off all protection shields. Oh no. Hopefully for the next episodes they may invest some budget for a clever story. Here , it tastes like the third boiling of a tea bag. All in all - boring. However, the special effects are cool, worth 4 stars"
" A good spiritual sequel
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,7,"The Force Awakens is an excellent film in that it successfully introduces a new era of Star Wars to a new generation of fans.However it is entirely derivitive of A New Hope. The plot is beat for beat the same and no amount of entertainment value can really raise this film beyond an average 6/10.Despite this, I gave it a 7/10. My reason for this is that it did what, in my opinion, the prequels couldn't: it captured the spirit of Star Wars. There wasn't a moment in this film that felt as if it didn't belong in the franchise, which is quite the feat to acheive for a franchise as large, popular and divisive as this one.And although much of the set up of this movie would be botched by the sequels, it is quite apt when looking at it in the context of this film alone and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't engaged by it or in antisipation for what would come when it was first released in 2015. At the time I felt Rey, Finn and Kylo Ren were all well rounded characters that had been established firmly. Their place in the universe seemed very well defined and for that I give this movie praise. So much so that I felt their presence and re-contextualised the plot (barely) enough that it didn't feel like an exact carbon copy of A New Hope; The casting, performances and character writing was very well done in this movie. That is with the exception of Finn's bizarre willingness to murder stormtroopers, despite previously having been one himself and sympathetic towards a friend of his, who had also been a stormtrooper.The first and best installment of the Sequel Trilogy is always entertaining and very engaging. I recommend seeing this film as it is enjoyable for people who are both Star Wars fanatics and new comers to the franchise."
" A Phenomenal Return
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,9,"When I saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens in theaters back in 2015, I was so speechless at how amazing this turned out. I thought it was going to be a pointless film, but I was wrong. It turned out to be an awesome comeback after all.The film takes place 3 decades after the Empire's defeat, and there is a new threat from a dark warrior, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), and his army of the First Order. A surrendering stormtrooper, Finn (John Boyega) and a scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) team up with old timers Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca, and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) to battle against Kylo and his army to restore freedom.What an amazing film. I would go out of my way to say this is my 2nd favorite Star Wars film. It is that good.The story was awesome and felt like a great reunion for the Star Wars universe. The acting was amazing from both the old and new cast members. It was awesome to see Ford and Fisher come back for another film, and the three new stars, Ridley, Boyega, and Driver, all were excellent all the way through. Ridley's character of Rey easily became one of my favorite Star Wars characters ever. She is very brave, strong, and capable of being a true warrior. Finn was also a really cool character. I liked how he decided to instead fight for the bad, he fought for the good.The pacing was also excellently fast for its time run of 2 hrs and 15 mins. The film also has incredibly beautiful and outstanding special effects and visuals. It has probably the best special effects I've seen in the 2010s to be honest.As a result, The Force Awakens is an awesome movie that brought old school Star Wars back with and added really cool new things."
" A shameless, soulless remake. I was a Star Wars fan. No longer.
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,2,Bring back George. This movie had zero originality. It's just the plot of the first movie with modern graphics and a dumbed down childish and stupid script.

",2019-12-28 00:00:00,9,"The adventure continued with the Star Wars gang! Han is back, as well as Leia, but Luke is not found. This movie surrounds him and his whereabouts. He is the last Jedi. This movie showed how great Star Wars is with the updated technology of movies looks amazing. The story is interesting. Rey being a scavenger and Finn being a run away stormtrooper. Han Solo is great as well. His old character was perfectly captured in this movie. Abrams took Star Wars to a whole new level. Kylo Ren is captured as a real bad guy. He shows darkness as Adam Driver plays it perfectly. I loved this movie inside and out."
" A shameless remake of Star Wars (1977)
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,1,"I came into this movie with a lot of excitement and hype December of 2015. Once the movie concluded, it all came to a crash. All the scenes in this movie play on your nostalgia. It never tried to be it's own thing. Nothing new or refreshing was added. They simply copy the Star Wars (1977) blueprint.We are introduced to the first order, which are essentially the first galactic empire from Star Wars (1977). It is lead by Kylo Ren who answers to Supreme Leader Snoke. A Lord Vader and Emporer Palpatine relationship. We are introduced to the resistance. They are essentially the rebellion from Star Wars (1977), except their name is copied from Terminator. The protagonist, Rey, comes from the planet Jakku. A desert planet like Luke's homeworld of Tattooine. The first order have built starkiller base. It's basically a bigger death star. If you haven't guessed already, it blows up in the end. Once again, important information a galactic empire is after is stored in a droid. JJ Abrams blatantly plagiarized the original Star Wars plot and passed it off as his own work.Kylo Ren is a much less imposing villain compared to Darth Vader. He often whines and throws temper tantrums. The writers seem to think that's intimidating, but it's really a sign of weakness. Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin never had to yell to have an intimidating presence. They sometimes raised their voice, but never show such emotional outbursts in front of their commanding officers. Such outbursts would show them they have no control, authority or confidence to solve a problem at hand. That's not how an organized and powerful galactic empire conducts leadership.Rey is an extremely boring protagonist. She is simply perfect at everything. She knows how to use the force without training. She can do jedi mind tricks without training. She can fly the millennium falcon better than Han Solo himself. At the end of the film, she beats the main villain of the film with no training. Note that Kylo Ren was trained by Luke Skywalker. She is truly the epitome of a Mary Sue and that's why this movie has no stakes whatsoever.Luke Skywalker was a character that had a lot to learn and room to grow. He needed to earn his way to become a jedi. In Star Wars (1977), Luke was being mentored by Obi Wan Kenobi. In The Force Awakens, Rey didn't even know the force existed and yet has all these abilities without anyone to teach her. Luke's development was much more interesting because Rey's was virtually nonexistent.Rey beating Kylo is like having Luke beat Vader in the very first movie. Would Darth Vader be the iconic villain that we know today if he was bested by a farm boy from Tattooine without training? A reoccuring villain is much less of a threat if the protagonist easily defeats them the first time they meet. That is how you lower the stakes. When Luke Skywalker first faced Darth Vader, he was toyed with and got his hand cut off. You had a feeling of hopelessness when Luke was dueling with Vader. That's how you portray a serious threat to the heroes.If you want to have a good star wars experience, just rewatch Star Wars (1977). It's pretty much the same movie, but better."

" Apparently the fourth highest-grossing film of all time... Why?
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,2,"So after many years I finally decided to watch this movie and when it was over I just had to breath. What the ... did I just watch? It's one of those movies that just makes me want to write a review just to share my pain and warn others who haven't watched the movie yet to just keep ignoring it. At the end I made a list of dumb moments because unlike others I'm not someone who forgets what just happened 5 minutes ago, a.k.a. the average fan Disney feeds this schlock to.
So to keep this review ""short"" (turned out not to be so short in the end) I will just point things out that I have noticed in a list:1. So the Millennium Falcon just happens to be on Jakku. Because ""HEY LOOK! IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!"" Rey and Fin escape and like an hour later (in movie time) Han and Chewie just happen to find them like they were ""just at the right place in the galaxy at the right time"". They later explain this is because ""They were easy to track, just imagine what would've happened if the First Order found you first."" Then why DIDN'T the First Order find them first with the vast amount of resources at their disposal? No, apparently an elderly man and his aging dog-man find them because ""HEY LOOK! IT'S HAN AND CHEWIE!""2. That frigging Star Killer base. First of all, how was this base so secretly built when it appears to have been right in the neighborhood of the Republic home worlds? Then the whole scene when it destroyed those planets was just slapped into the movie like
""Ok, Han, Fin and Rey are now on this planet... what can happen?""""I know, let's use the Star Killer base and let it destroy some stuff so everyone knows that the First Order is BAD, it can even be seen from the secret hideout planet our main cast is on with the naked eye because why not?""Later it's explained that it needs the sun to charge and fire. Okay, but then how does it fire again when the sun is depleted? Does it have engines to move around in space? Why doesn't the whole ecological system of the planet go nuts when the sun is suddenly gone? And why does it have a shield that can be easily penetrated by any ship capable of faster than light travel... you know, ANY ship in the Star Wars universe? The resistance shows up at the base with what feels like 15 X-Wing's piloted by emotionless buffoons. ""HEY LOOK, LIGHTSABERS!""3. Apparently Rey is great at everything. For being raised as a scavenger on a lone desert planet she can fly ships, use hand guns with impressive accuracy, fight and win with a lightsaber against someone who had years more experience than her, use the force to mind-trick people when she feels like it AND just happened to find Luke's lightsaber in a dusty old box by pure luck after walking into some shady bar and hearing a baby cry. What the ...?4. When Chewie, Fin and Han get captured by the First Order on the forested hideout planet they get instantly rescued by the resistance. ""HEY LOOK, X-WINGS!"" Han meets Leia after many years yet both characters lack any emotion. They just hug each other, not even a kiss even though they are supposed to be a couple. All these characters in the movie feel just as lifeless and dead inside as the people who made this film were in reality.5. Poe meets Fin at the resistance outpost after he was supposedly killed in the crash landing on Jakku at the beginning of the movie. The only explanation given how he survived was literally just ""I woke up at night, no ship, you were gone... but BB-8 just told me you completed my mission, good boy!"" What in the holy mother of god kind of explanation is that? I still don't know how he got off that planet. Last thing we saw was that the First Order destroyed everything on Jakku, ships, encampments, equipment... did he just hitchhike back to the resistance base and then be at the hideout planet in just the right time to rescue Fin and company? Yeah... no.6. You want me to believe Captain Phasma, this super hardcore storm trooper captain, just deactivated the shield of the super important Star Killer base thing after Fin and Han told her so while pointing a gun to her head? I expected her to tell them ""Go F' yourselves, kill me and you will never disable those shields!"" but she just does it. Rey wasn't in the scene so a possible mind trick of Phasma by her is impossible. The scene ends with a forced reference to A New Hope.7. Han Solo dies and Fin and Rey CRY like they've known him for years and not just a few hours. I guess he was ""Rey's father she never had""... Okay? This guy she just met and had a boring adventure or two with is now a father substitute for her all of the sudden? All they did was scream at each other while trying to survive one thing after the other. Guess Han offered Rey a job at one point and she was excited? Nah, I don't buy it, they cry because all the man babies in the cinema were crying and so Rey could have an emotional moment when she was fighting Kylo Ren a moment later. ""HEY LOOK, HAN SOLO IS DEAD! LIGHTSABERS!""8. BB-8 randomly removes a piece of cloth from a deactivated R2D2 in a scene for no reason. C3PO tells him some stuff about Luke but who cares, not even a minute later the scene is already over. At the end of the movie R2D2, for some reason, comes back to life and is then used as a deus ex machina so the resistance can have the entire map to Luke's whereabouts because the creators forgot that they basically destroyed all the other important map parts the First Order had with the Star Killer base. I guess this is why the first scene with R2D2 felt so out of place, like it was added late in production when the makers had no idea how the resistance could now find Luke without the First Order maps.9. Then at the last minute Rey travels in not even a minute of hyperspace to where Luke is hiding in a desperate attempt to mimic Luke's plot to find Yoda in the original trilogy. She finds him and BOOM, the movie's finally over. What an anticlimactic ending. What a relief. ""HEY LOOK, IT'S LUKE!""Oh boy, this is getting too long for my taste so I'm stopping here. I'm planning on watching the other two movies as well but I definitely won't review them like I did this one or else I would still be typing by tomorrow seeing how this was supposed to be the ""best one"" of the trilogy. I will just leave my star for them and go on my merry way.
When people told me these movies were made for stupid people I couldn't believe them, that they would be that bad but after watching this ""thing"" myself all I can say is that humanity is heading in the right path for extinction."
" A Action Packed Way To Get People Back Into Star Wars
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,7,"I hadn't seen this movie in years, but with The Rise of Skywalker coming out I decided to re visit it. This movie is just fun. The whole time you are cheering and on the edge of your seat. However Rey as a character is riddled with flaws. We learn she has potential but we don't see her go through anything to unlock said potential. The action scenes are great but some of the other scenes feel boring and slow. Still, a fun movie. 7.5/10"
" Plan 9 remake
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a remake of ""Plan 9 From Outerspace"" ! Seriously, people literally died and they had to make up stuff and fill stuff in. If you've seen Plan 9 then you know exactly how this movie ends, horribly! More questions than answers. No closure is offered! Save your money."
" A wonky force
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,5,"Here we go again. Everyone is back except Darth Vader etc. So why all the negative reviews? This is good entertainment, but not much more. Star Wars is maybe the first movie franchise, or the first cinematic universe. So no point complaining about Star Wars being commercial. It is the the definition of commersialism.Is it a good movie? Not particularly good. The main problem is that thee characters lack depth, its not the acting that is bad. Ok Harrison Ford is bad, but not the rest.Visual effects and sound is outstanding as always in these movies. These effects work well to cover up for the uninteresting plot. Which of course is one of the main ideas of this franchise."
" Great Intro to Star Wars for a New Generation
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Even though this trilogy couldn't stick the landing by any means, I find The Force Awakens to still be memorable and enjoyable five years later. Yes, it generously borrows plot points from A New Hope, but adds just enough new stuff to make it a relevant sequel to such a beloved franchise. The same cannot be said for the films that follow.The way J.J. Abrams portrays the Force in The Force Awakens is particularly fantastic, same being said for the lightsabers, as they both have a new sense of strength, power, and intensity.Also, don't mind the people who came back to give this movie a 1/10 after seeing The Rise of Skywalker. I was disappointed with that movie to say the least, but would never rate this movie differently because of it. Hate for the sake of hating is a waste of everyone's time."
" A decent film
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,7,"A mostly positive experience, this film is the good kind of flashy and feels like a true Star Wars sequel. It has high flying escapades, robots, interesting character development, and unique uses of the Force. It does seem to suffer in context to the following films, but as a standalone it is a fun action film."
" This movie is lame
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,4,It's just a rehash of Star Wars IV with lame modern troupes
" DISNEY DUMPSTER FIRE !!!!! Run for the hills..
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,1,"Disney only cares about money, they dont give a good god damn about anything or anyone... That being said, the ABSOLUTE WORST thing G lucas could have done was sell the rights to them.... That being said, Disney has butchered the last 3 movies but this one is the absolute worst of the 3.... hands down... The ignorant Fan Boys ( mostly comprised of stupid millennials) will say this is the best , but what the hell do they know..... this whole movie is one big rip off of a new hope... and disney has lured the mindless sheep to come watch this garbage.... i mean seriously... terrible writing, with more holes than the Iraqi Navy, bad character choices with no development, a sith lord wannabe that wears a mask from gi joe ( and does not need to wear one).... has a temper tantrum like a millennial fan boy, another death star ( like we have already seen before), another desert planet ( aka tatoine), and they kill off han solo for no reason.... give me a break !!!! People, WAKE THE HELL UP!!! And just run far away from this movie... run for the hills!!!"
" Its Still a Good Movie Guys
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,7,"While I agree that the original films are better, I still enjoyed watching this film. I was intrigued by the notion of Kilo Ren, and what a character he is. You can't deny that the writers did a phenomenal job making this character. And Adam Divers performance makes it even better. He is obviously conflicted throughout the entire movie and seems to have an interesting past. I am very excited to see what happens to this character in the next films. I also love the tension between Kilo and his Father, and by extent Kilo and Rey (personally I'm kind of shipping Kilo and Rey). Anyway, though this movie wasn't a ""big break through"" or anything I still enjoyed it."
" Better titled as A Newer Hope
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,7,"Oh my god, I just got done re-watching/reviewing the trilogy prequel by George Lucas and always lamented how poorly written/directed they were right from the outset but my gourd, how much better The Force Wakens started than those! Though JJ Abrams wrote/directed this one, at least there's a small army of producers and a different editor. George ""I have control issues"" Lucas' prequels sadly had no other input than his own. The first chase scene was weak though, Rey, with Finn, commandeers the Millenium Falcon without any biometrics or start codes, hmm, then she navigates it expertly albeit accidentally, but c'mon, she should've crashed this within the first 10-secs, then through ""Hollywood magic"" the two rookies best two trained TIE fighters, ugh, this again. But this was redeemed in a subsequent scene when Rey/Finn attempted to trap some raiders on a freighter but unleashed nasty monsters instead. The rest of the action/story was pretty decent except near the end as the planet 'sploded, those rescues were lazy deus ex. But just at the end when you're noticing that the old gang is all re-unioned except Luke, Rey finds him as an old Sith-lord looking hermit. Without a word, she immediately offers his lightsword, but the way JJ filmed it, it comes off as if she's offering a Coke to him, weird. And that's how he ended it, also weird and unsatisfying."
" JJ nailed it
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,9,"I don't understand why people say this is a cheap copy of A New Hope. Please The Phantom Menace had more similarities to A New Hope than Force Awakens. Did it have some similarities? Sure! The biggest one was the weapon they had, The Starkiller Base. But that's it. This movie left you wanting more! Like you wished that the movie wouldn't end! I feel like that is the only Star Wars movie in the entire saga to have that feeling!"
" Waste of money.
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,2,Utter rubbish. Terrible acting by a bunch of unknowns. Disappointing as I thought with JJ Abrams directing it would be better.
" My third best Star Wars movie
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,10,"It was incredible the effects of the movie I love the first scene that appears Kylo Ren it was incredible because it was like wow the new Sith of the Skywalker Saga and the scene that Poe Dameron And Finn (FN-2187) on the Caza Tie And when Rey, Finn And BB-8 escape from the First Order in the Millenium Falcon I think that was the best scene for me"
" nostalgia bait
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,3,"Jar Jar Abrams plays it safe by abusing the endless well of star wars knowledge that many people still have in their life today.
not the worst star wars movie, but probably close to it.
The main complaint is how everyone is just supposed to believe that stuff like the clones are just not a thing anymore and that happens off screen (its not cannon anymore). As well how everything the rebellion did during the originals is just casted away and was all for nothing.
Leia mourns with REY!!! instead of chewy?
This movie is just not enjoyable after watching the entire series again. It feels more disconnected from the other movies, and lacks the bond that the prequels (best movies) and originals had.
At best its mediocre as rey is just unfollowble
At worst its a pathetic entry into the star wars universe"
" Facepalming so hard and being ashamed for the movie fandom
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,9,It's just sad. People come back to the force awakens and give it a worse review because they didn't like Last Jedi or Rise of Skywalker and thus have to hate on the entire trilogy. Sad. Sad. Sad.
" Great Star Wars movie
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,10,"Great plot, great actors, everything is so amazing"
" Trash story
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,1,"I just discovered the star wars legends lore. It seems to be way better than what came out of disney's pure economical move, and I can't see the reason they didn't use at least parts of it."
" A generally enjoyable film
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,8,"The film manages to capture the essence of Star Wars, and has decent production values. It also provides the audience with intriguing questions about the characters of this film.However, this films relies heavily on the overall feel of the Original Trilogy, evident in its plot that resembles that if A New Hope.In conclusion, this is a fun and interesting film to watch, however, it's dependence on the Original Trilogy material may be limits to the creativity and rewatchability of the film."
" Lacks of imagination
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,5,"I love Star Wars. I've watched every movie and played many of the games. I love it's universe. I didn't like that Disney was behind it, but I coped with it.
The movie is entertaining and I won't get in details about performances, effects or things like that. I think there's plenty of critics that talk about it so I won't be original.
However, I'm writing this because one thing that I really can't help keeping for myself. The main antagonist is pure garbage. Not Kylo Ren itself, but the First Order.
They don't make any sense. How it is possible that the New Republic didn't know what was happening? Come on! They literally just have won a ver hard rebellion with everything against them. Where is the senate? Where is the political part that play a big part in previous movies? Did they just vanished in thin air? Where is the republican army? Seriously, when the republic was at war against the Federation of Commerce and the separatist there were very big battles, many plots at play.
In this movie the story is just lazy and formulaic. ""OK, now, OUT OF NOWHERE, we are going to have a powerful but absolutely secretive empire in the darkness with no real reason to exist whatsoever and that strikes so efficiently that put in danger the New Republic in one minute"".
With that massive amount of money I believe they can think up something better."
" A great movie
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,10,A good start for the sequel trilogy keep up the good work
" Could have been better
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,6,"The new star wars movie wasn't bad but it could have been waaaaay better.That movie is cool but I think the ending of one of the most popular saga in the galaxy deserve a better ending.Once again disney,you deceived me."
" Great Star Wars Movie
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,8,"So here's the thing.... Abrams made a very decent Star Wars movie, with a great story line, with a strong male lead and a strong female lead. Yes, it certainly had elements of A New Hope, but that is to be expected because we have a new villain who had to be introduced, and new characters.The end.Y'all can stop hating now."
" It was good movie
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,10,I very much like this movie. And see new actors in it
" Too many questions, not enough story
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,7,"It was ok, because of some scenes (sword of Skywalker), but overall it was not satisfying enough. Too different from the original storyline and not enough credibility."
" It all started here
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,1,"Think of all the directions they could have taken this film in, all the possibilities, and what did they do? Reset all timelines and wiped the achievements of the previous 6 films.6 ended with the rebels celebrating the end of the empire and death star. So why on earth is 7 opening with the rebels being chased by an empire with a death star?It's just shockingly unforgivable levels of amateurism, they didn't even bother attempting to come up with a narrative so rehashed everything. Were there writers for this film? What were they paid for? 98% of the film doesn't carry an ounce of creativity.For some bizarre reason people tend to defend this film as a ""safe entry"" to rebuild the franchise for a new generation, for them to take it in new directions afterwards. What? This is episode 7 of a 9-length narrative for goodness sake.. You can't have episodes 4 and 7 telling the same story. The only remotely interesting aspect of the film is the mystery surrounding the search for Luke.There was no excuse for TFA, they chose nostalgia over creativity and paid the price for it with the following train-wrecks when TLJ was forced to desperately trying something new. I suppose it made a lot of cash mind, and that was the sole objective."
" The Sequel Trilogy Is Over! ~ And Looking Back The Force Awakens Was The Best Of The 3.
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,9,"Easily the best Star Wars film in the sequel trilogy.
It was a good basis and I loved the rendition to a new home which was clever by Abrams.
Should be appreciated by many.
Shame the last Jedi didn't quite follow that down that path that Abrams left...
JJ Abrams should have directed the whole sequel trilogy and I'm sure if that would've been the way.. The outcome sure as hell would've been different from a very divided Star Wars fan base."
" Finn is ludicrous
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,4,"A disappointing rehash of episode IV, the worst aspect of which is the ridiculous Finn character. He instantly goes from being a stormtrooper to the nicest and best human in the galaxy. However, all the other stormtroopers remain killable subhuman . The worst part is that they've really missed a trick - an escaped 'child soldier' could have been an extremely complex character. But no, this is the muppet babies in space.
I don't get the hype around JJ Abrahams, his style is more suited to fast and furious that ruining the legacy of the otherwise wonderful world of Star Wars!"
" It's not a sexy, environment friendly original film.
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,4,"I loved how stupid Han was to actually believe his Son still cared about him and was actually worth his time to even speak to, it felt like a fitting end to the worst character of all time that took a poop on Anakin's legacy by sexually abusing his daughter.However, this is a poor remake of A New Hope for the most part except Luke is a cheap replacement for Obi-Wan as Luke has no dialogue and only appears for 5 seconds and the other main characters are even more mindless than the OT main characters. It also had featured far too much spaceships in this film to the extent I think it's done some children some damage by encouraging them to wreck the environment by spending as much time in motorised vehicles as possible."
" Gutless
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,1,"Lacks the Star Wars ""magic"" and tries to mechanically rehash A New Hope. This movie should be thrown away and forgotten."
" HOW DARE YOU ??!!
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,1,"My message is that I've been watching you J.J. This is all wrong.
I shouldn't be up here.
I should be in my parents basement playing video games.
Yet Dysney come to us you for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. An entire Star War fanhood is collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass fans extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of Rey Skywalker.
How dare you!"
" Why all the hate?
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,6,"I really liked this movie! Yes it's plot is similar to ""A New Hope"", but the execution is different enough to make it feel fresh. I've seen it twice. In Theaters in 2015 and today. I wanna quickly mention, that the cinematography by Dan Mindel is extremely underrated! It should at least have gotten an Oscar nomination. The score by John Williams is great as always, though not many original cues. ""Rey's Theme"" and ""March of the Resistance"" are however exceptions. Overall a really great experience, great characters, dialogue and a flowing pace delivered by J. J. Abrams. A 4/5 stars from me."
" Not bad
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,6,This one gets lots of hate because it had a familiar story but it did its job and got me hyped for the next saga film. The big shocker is kinda sucky but I understood it from a three film narrative and character building. Sadly all of it was squandered in the end.
" Safe corporate product to deliver nostalgia
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,5,"It deliveres on what it is trying to be.
Though plot's a rehash of original Star Wars' plot, but this time almost everything is run by coincidence and galaxy seems to be the size of a small town, judging how easily everyone runs into each other."
" Awkwardly forced
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,2,"This film was assuredly critic proof and having seen it that was certainly an advantage that it needed.Why would you make the ""next"" Star Wars film like this? After a production hiatus and a change of franchise ownership. The first installment of a sequel trilogy? Episode VII of a nine part saga?It's as though there was no confidence on the part of the film makers and financiers that Star Wars fans would go see it........and take their families and friends.......in some instances repeatedly.They could have written, produced and released anything. Anything that their imaginations could conceive and their film making skills convey.So.Why this? Is this what they wanted to make?A one paced remake. A prolonged slow, plodding, remake apology for touching the Star Wars brand? Why did they turn apologists for their own film making?An entire movie of apologising for casting new actors in new roles in a new era of new stories. OK. We know it's not 1977 or 1999 or any part of the 20th century.But there was no confidence that anything that these filmmakers would produce would be accepted by fans without a two hour apology on the part of the new management.Perhaps because Disney had bought Lucasfilm simply because it was for sale and a desirable property to investing in.Maybe.As I watched this fresh in the cinema I realised that this film was bad because of how boring it was. Within thirty minutes of the opening scroll I was bored and getting increasingly so.I wondered how professional filmmakers could produce a film so one paced. So incapable of telling a story in a manner that human beings naturally respond to, like a rhythm of life, like how almost every competent story teller does it. Modulation I believe is the term. Changes of pace and tone. Changes if emphasis and urgency. Things like that diminish the capacity for boring fiction. This film has a sky high over capacity.Because the one paced storytelling is resolutely slow paced. Like a ship sluggishly responding to the helm at very low speeds. This film has a turning circle that never quits.In part it is slowed down by the plethora of characters. The film sadly has two casts and that is far too many characters for this level of storytelling to carry.You can almost see scenes getting out of the way so that the next character can introduce themselves. Then that scene stands aside so that a previously ponderously introduced new or reintroduced returning character can have a 'doing' scene. Then they, and their scene, step aside for the next introduction. Which repeats the formula once again. For ages this film keeps doing this.Unfortunately I found the acting to be as awkward as the written filmplay must have read. New actors were awkward. Returning actors were awkward. Awkward individually. Awkward in concert. Generational difference doesn't have to produce an effect like this....an effect similar to one you may experience bumping into an old friend that you no longer have anything in common with. Or an ex partner.....Harrison Ford seems as bored as I was watching his performance. I've since seen 'Solo: A Star Wars story' and I still think that this is the single worst performance of the role of Han Solo that I've ever witnessed.Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford's returning characters take the awkwardness analogy of exes too literally. Why and who even wrote that? And with them both being pretty severe victims of 'Hollywood face syndrome' I couldn't decide if they were too bored to emote or just too numbed.I thought that the sound design was poor for a Star Wars film, not least the iconic lightsaber duel sound effect, which was ruined by the debatable decision to give the chief goon Kylo Ten a 'lightbroadsword' which had an unattractive sound effect best put down as a simple ""bad creative decision"".Finally I suppose the believability of the drama was utterly lacking. After all these characters are introduced, given their own scene, moved around the galaxy in twos and threes, there's no build up of credibility in any one of them. No credibility means no involvement. No involvement means no suspension of disbelief. And that means no drama. No thrills. No suspense. No climax. No release.It means boring.This is compounded by the choice of premise for our dangerous motivating driver; the thing prodding our protagonist to protagonise: 'The First Order' and it's ""armed forces"".Hhhmmmmmmmm. Boringly derivative nonsense that degrades the original trilogy not so much by underplaying the extent of the goodies win in that contest but denying the new generation a truly distinctive baddie of their own to best. It isn't the original generation of character heros being short changed........its the new ones who are expecting to carry on the thrilling action adventures in space!!!What a way to start. With a total lack of confidence and conviction. A total disdain for the filmmakers own competency.That's my reasoning to explain why this is so boring that it's just finally, frankly, really bad."
" Derivative, but thankfully it derives from an enjoyable Star Wars film.
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,8,"If you've watched the original Star Wars, you know the plot to The Force Awakens- a droid containing vital information to the Rebellion is placed under the care of a lone person on a desert planet who is then tasked with the safe delivery of the droid to the Rebellion without any unnecessary entanglements with the evil Empire, who pursue the same droid and its custodians. There is even a planet-destroying battle station at the end for the Rebels to destroy. Just replace the faction names with Resistance and First Order, replace the droid's name with BB-8 instead of R2-D2, and replace the character's names and the names of the planets and battle-stations they are on, and boom, you've got The Force Awakens.It's almost a formula at this point- and it's one that this movie sticks to, so obediently that it is almost laughable. That is not to say that this isn't an enjoyable film- if your Star Wars film is inspired by the Star Wars film that literally gave birth to more Star Wars films- it's going to be fun as hell. And this film is, even though it doesn't have nearly as much impact as the 1977 original, which is close to impossible to achieve in today's day and age.It's obvious what the writers set out to achieve for this film. They knew of the backlash that the prequel trilogy faced for being so different from the original films, so they wanted to craft a film for a new generation that emulated what they felt when they watched the original Star Wars- which is understandable considering the amount of death threats and irrationality that had a clear presence in the Star Wars fanbase after the prequel trilogy came out.The Force Awakens manages to deliver on some key things that make Star Wars fun- the film is nicely paced, the new characters are interesting, and it acts as a good stepping-off point for these new characters to go in directions that the original trilogy characters might not have in the subsequent films. After ten years of no Star Wars, listening to John Williams' iconic fanfare is a rousing experience, although that leads me to one of the film's faults- which definitely extends to the entire trilogy. The Force Awakens is too dependent on nostalgia for a lot of the moments that just 'click'. They're good moments, but honestly, I expected this pattern to end after this film and The Last Jedi, but after coming out of The Rise of Skywalker, that definitely isn't the case.Yes, there are scenes like the one on the bridge of Starkiller Base between Ben Solo and his father that really stand out in terms of originality, but there is not a lot else in the movie that truly brims with imagination. Starkiller Base essentially being a system-destroying, just plain bigger Death Star, definitely doesn't help.This film does work- at least on its own. It may not be original but at least it isn't boring- not something I thought I would be proud to say before the prequel trilogy came out, but now I guess I am."
" Has stood the test of time well
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,7,I saw this again as part of s triple bill on opening night of episode 9 and I was pleasantly surprised how well this film has held up.Although maybe not the best star wars film out has a very good recipe of characters and story line to set up the beginning of the end of the series.Although there are still some characters I don't think are great and some questionable acting is still a great film.

" Such a disappointment
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,5,"I wanted to like this movie. Star Wars has always been my favourite film franchise and this was my first time seeing a new one in the theatre. It was such a disappointment, especially considering what it could have been. If your nostalgia for the original trilogy outweighs any other opinions you would have, I have no doubt you would like this movie because that's what it is: a feature-length ""tribute"" to the original three movies. But that's where its biggest problem lies.The Force Awakens tries to recapture the original trilogy, especially the first movie, but it has no charm to it. It's like a game of fill in the blanks: exchange Luke for Rey, Leia for Poe, Han for Finn, Vader for Kylo, throw in the same basic story and suck the life out of it. It might sound a little mean, but that's what this movie felt like. I swear they even referenced how they were just copying the first movie when they brought up the differences between the Death Star and Starkiller Base, like they knew what they were doing, which I have no doubt they did.Don't get me wrong: it's entertaining and I still get some enjoyment watching it, but that doesn't stop its problems from coming to the forefront."
" Very enjoyable for us fans
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,7,"WARNING: MINOR LITTLE SPOILERS THAT DONT REALLY MATTER
I'll have to state that I was far from being born
when the original trilogy came out. In fact, I was born right around the time of the prequels. As such I grew up watching Star Wars in ""chronological"" order. As with many fans Star Wars was an unforgettable part of my childhood. So of course when this came out I watched it, this time all grown up. What glaringly stood out to me was that the plot is very much like A New Hope. Everything, from the desert planet, the characters, the final third act of blowing up the Death Star's bigger brother reminded me of ANH. To me, I didn't mind it. I felt it paid good respect to the original trilogy. It was never boring or felt gimmicky. Is this a masterpiece? An Empire Stikes Back? No. But is it trash like some say? No. It is a joyride. I found myself smiling at many scenes, particularly the ones with the original gang of Leia Han and chewie, even luke at the end. To the average viewer, the acting is fine. And this being sci-fi, the visuals are amazing. They live up to our expectations of a Star Wars film. Everything can be seen in such clarity now. You now appreciate the designs of the X wings the star destroyers the planets and everything else much more better. This is by all means a good film. A very watchable, enjoyable and fun film. I give this a 7/10 because that's what it deserves. An 8 or 9 is reserved for truly special films, ones that are groundbreaking and iconic such as The Empire stikes back. But do all films have to be groundbreaking? No. This is a film not to tackle modern day issues, politics or racism. This is no Moonlight, 12 Years a Slave or Spotlight. This is a film made to entertain us, to make us walk out of the theatre smiling. And that is how I will remember this film"
" Flawed, but it's still Star Wars
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,8,"J. J. Abrams couldn't have had it easy. He had to bring back Star Wars for the diehard fans, had to appease those that didn't like the prequel trilogy, had to take into account the new fans... all the while working for the Black Mouse of Disney, who's notorious about keeping it clean and family friendly.And keeping that in mind, this is a pretty good movie. Borderline great. Is it as good as the original films? No, it's not. But there's a very small chance that it ever could have been. The planets simply weren't in alignment.The things I like about this film are the characters and the atmosphere. This feels like Star Wars. Everything is dirty and falling apart. We have these fantastically futuristic gadgets, but they're rusted, filled with sand and need a good kick every now and then to work. That's Star Wars in a nutshell. The cinematography is also gorgeous and this film has some of the finest shots seen so far in the franchise. I especially like the shot of a humongous Star Destroyer battleship half buried in the desert. Gives the whole world gravitas and history.And the characters are great. From John Boyega's Finn to Daisy Ridley's Rey to Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron. Quintessentially Star Wars these characters, while also exploring new ground.But, let us not forget the returning cast. Ford, Fisher and Hamill slip effortlessly back into their career-defining characters and we couldn't have been happier.The one major thing I don't like about this film is the fact that's it's pretty much a retelling of Episode Four: A New Hope, the original film. We have an orphan on a desert planet hearing the call of adventure, we have a droid hiding secret information, we have the evil empire, we have a masked bad guy in black, we have the reluctant outlaw ally, we have the scene in a cantina/bar, and so on and so on.An admiring nod now and then would be fine, appreciated even. Paying an homage would be expected. Telling the story all over again, beat by beat, is simply lazy.Sure, there will be those that tell you that it's supposed to be this way, that it is intentional and that they wanted to introduce Star Wars to a whole new age group. But, tell me, how many people are going to see this as their first Star Wars film? Not many, I tell you. The original film is such a huge cultural milestone that there's no way the majority of people in the future are going to see this film before that one. Which makes this whole shtick of doing it all over again simply pointless.Nevertheless, it's a good film. A bit aggravating, true, but still good."
" Incredible reboot
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,10,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens is an incredible reboot/sequel that successfully combines the new with the old in an emotional, consistently funny and thrilling revitalisation of the Skywalker saga. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are all incredible. Adam Driver is also incredible as Kylo Ren, the franchise's most interesting and compelling villain. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are also incredible with their returning characters having grown and evolved since episode VI. It's expertly paced without a single scene dragging or being boring. The music by John Williams is once again reliably perfect. J. J. Abrams' direction is excellent and the film is visually stunning with excellent CG. It also has a fantastic lightsaber fight."
" Terrible.
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,1,"Wrong casting, wrong director, wrong writer, wrong script, wrong everything. Terrible movie but I have to be honest, it is completely unoriginal. It is a complete ripoff of New Hope. It is sickening to think millions of dollars we're wasted."

" A Weak Movie
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,6,"On first viewing, four years ago, when all the thirst for Star Wars was there, this was a very good movie. Then fast forward to one night before The Rise of Skywalker and a few minutes after rewatching The Last Jedi... The Force Awakens is a weak, safe, nostalgia-driven movie. It has zero heart and zero risk. It's a play that's good enough to keep the audience around for what was to come, but on its own, it's just... okay."
" Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,7,"Directed by J. J. Abrams. Starring Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Harrison Ford, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Carrie Fisher, Domhnall Gleeson, Peter Mayhew, Lupita Nyong'o, Anthony Daniels, Andy Serkis, Max von Sydow, Gwendolyn Christie, Mark Hamill. (PG-13)Continuation of the ""Star Wars"" saga (and start of a new trilogy) picks up a few decades after the end of ""Return of the Jedi,"" bringing back old characters and introducing new ones, such as a young scav with raw but powerful force powers (Ridley), a stormtrooper who betrays the First Order (the ""new"" Empire) and joins the resistance (Boyega), and the greatest pilot the good guys have who isn't established any further than just being a great pilot (Isaac). Lively, well-mounted production looks good and has energy and humor to spare, but does little in the way of innovation, and instead offers two-plus hours of nostalgia, even blatantly echoing story elements from the original blockbuster. There's also too little information filling in the gaps between episodes, and the lack of development cheapens a major death late in the film that could have been a grand, operatic tragedy if given greater accumulation and context. Still, a heartily entertaining film for fans to relish after the disappointing prequel trilogy; episodic but cohesive comfort food. Keep an eye (or ear) out for Daniel Craig's recognizable voice coming from a stormtrooper.72/100"
" Messy and cluttered, but mostly comes together
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,6,"This shares a lot of the same structural problems as Episode I, but it's better made, more energetically assembled, and with stronger dialogue which helps make up for it. There are a lot of stories floating around in this thing which obfuscates the emotional core of the film, which does float to the surface by the end, though it's not quite as well built as it could be.The movie pretty much doesn't have a main character. It's seemingly Rey, but she doesn't really get an outsized amount of screentime for her character motivations and actions as opposed to Finn. So, it's really a dual journey, but they have very different motivations driving them. Finn's is pretty clear. He wants to escape the First Order after his first taste of battle (which is really a massacre) and he'll do anything, including freeing a captured Resistance pilot, to do it.Rey has an interesting dichotomy at her core. She has a yearning for escape and adventure sitting in front of her makeshift home on the desert planet of Jakku, but she also refuses to leave. When given the opportunity to go, she initially takes it and then tries to go back. She's waiting for her family. What that actually means is unclear, but she has a motive to stay. That's interesting, however it gets lost by about the halfway point. Landing on the planet with Maz Kanata, she mentions a desire to go back home and it never comes up again. That core conflict of her character just kind of stops as she gets swept up in the adventure. Even at the end, she makes no mention of going back to Jakku, even to note how she doesn't want it anymore, instead just acceding to go and take the final leg to Luke Skywalker's hidden location.Rey's antagonist ends up being Kylo Ren, and he is the single best part of this movie. The contrast between who he wants to be and who he is, manifested physically through the mask he wears that echoes Darth Vader's mask but serves none of the practical functions, is great. He wants to be the Dark Lord that everyone fears, but without his mask he looks like a brooding kid. He's obviously powerful, but he also just doesn't have the control or inspire the same level of menace without aid. His desire for more is what drives him, and it's great.On top of our two nominal main characters, we also have Han Solo, who's concerned with his relationship with his son and former wife. Once he's introduced in the film, his issues tend to overshadow those of everyone else around him because you just can't have Han Solo in a revamped Star Wars movie and have him play a supporting role, apparently.The split personality of the film is really magnified, though, by the fact that it has two plots and the second one doesn't appear until about 80 minutes into the film. The first is the more interesting one. Luke Skywalker has gone missing and everyone's looking for a map that will lead to him. It's small, focused, and different from what we've had before. And then, about 45 minutes into the movie, we see Starkiller Base, a bigger Death Star, and we know what's going to happen. Mention of attacking Starkiller Base doesn't actually happen until about the 80 minute point when it completely takes over the film for the rest of the runtime until the very end. The Starkiller Base stuff and the end to Alien: Covenant remind me of each other. They're both compressed versions of the original films, and they both stick out from the rest of the film.That being said, the climax of the film, particularly the final lightsaber duel is what almost saves the film for me. Aside from being slickly produced and just simply looking great with the darkness, the bright lightsabers, and the snowy forest setting, are a great place to have your two main characters face off. And it is here that it becomes obvious that Rey is supposed to be the main character. Kylo easily dispatches Finn, and the movie long red herring is out of the way, clearing the path for the real protagonist to finally step forward. That game the movie plays up to this point frustrates the whole experience (especially considering its irrelevance), but once there we get something interesting. Kylo is trying to attract the unmolded Rey to the Dark Side, attempting to further his own ambition by adding an apprentice, something he's pretty obviously not ready for. And, on the other side of the duel, Rey is confronted with her newfound power and actual adventure, and she has to make a choice.Final thoughts about Rey:Rey would be a really interesting character if she weren't so damn good at everything she does. She can fly the Millennium Falcon better than Han Solo ever could without ever having touched its controls and with the admission that she's not actually that good of a pilot (The Force, apparently helped her). She figures out the Jedi Mind Trick without knowing she could do it. She speaks or understands whatever language gets thrown at her (droid and Wookie, for instance). And then she bests a man trained in lightsaber combat. Now, out of all of what she does here, the only thing she does that's important to her character is defeating Kylo Ren at the end, and that's actually explainable because Kylo wasn't taking the fight seriously (it's so obvious even I can tell he's playing with both Finn and Rey) and was opening himself up to a sudden fierce attack. Without all of the other conveniences, that sudden turn around wouldn't feel like just another in a long line of things that this character was great at. I get the suspicion that Rey's flight of the Falcon was originally Poe's flight but got rewritten to her. It makes a whole lot more sense if the greatest Resistance pilot does that stuff instead of just the scavenger girl on the desert planet.Overall though, the movie is a victim of its structure designed to hide who its main character is as well as provide a quick remake of Star Wars and the need to prominently feature Han Solo. It almost overcomes its issues, but not quite."
" JJ ABrams Destroyed Star Wars
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,2,"It is game over.The characters are so unexplained, the 'acting' is so terrible and the cosplayer with the cheap mask so tacky that Star Wars died. Dead, done, croaked, passed on...I am pretty sure I already saw a DVD of Episode 9 (the Skywalker something something) in the dollar bin."
" It's solid... but it's only because it's a rip off of the original film
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,5,"The only reason this film is okay is because it ripped off another film, deliberate or not it doesn't matter, you take that pillar away and this films plummets to the ground.Rey is a stale protagonist and honestly Rey and Kylo should of swapped places, Kylo actually struggles with things while Rey doesn't, Kylo actually feels conflicted while Rey doesn't. There's no tension at all and there never will be.Also the light-saber fights are ridiculous in this film, Getting a light-saber to the body should leave a mark! Kylo Ren walks away with scars but Finn doesn't?I don't have too much to say about this film other than it's a rip off, I've already seen a film like this and I've been charged money to go see it again."
" Always...
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,9,"Let me just say, if you love Star Wars for the amazing efects, lights, explosions, Disney have made a beautiful job! Now... how could you kill Solo like Dumbledore? Yeah the kid reminds Severus Snape, and yeah Chewie reminds Hagrid but still... not cool Disney, even if Harison Ford its old, he is a legend that deserves to die at least at episode IX!"
" Solid movie
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,7,This was a decent movie but it was nothing spectacular in terms of story. There is nothing much fascinating about the plot. Visually it is great to look at. A lot of hardwork went into making this movie and you really see it in the sets and costumes and cgi. The movie itself did not surprise me or captivate me.
" A very good start to a new trilogy
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,8,"A very good start to a new trilogy. The Force Awakens introduces new interesting characters and the dialogue/action/CGI sequences are far better than the other Star Wars movies. The movie isn't particularly original, nor does it have a fascinating villain like the OG Star Wars films, but it has a great new protagonist and some powerful emotional sequences that allow us to bask in our joy of Star Wars."

" Solid return to Star Wars
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,9,"Star Wars The Force Awakens. A fantastic Star Wars movie with new interesting characters and the old characters returning to pass on the torch to a new generation of heroes.I enjoy this one alot the new characters are amazing and interesting and I like Kylo Ren and Rey.
Seeing the old characters is also amazing I love seeing an old Han Solo and Old Leia it's seeing them again everything they've done.The action is great and the effects are amazing and the look of this new star wars is brilliant to see.I really the character of Kylo Ren he is definitely a highlight for me in this new trilogy. I also like that he's Hans son it's such a great moment when that's revealed.Rey is also an interesting and there's a great mystery behined her in this one and the whole new trilogy. When the Lightsaber calls to her in this one its very interesting.Han Solo being killed was a great moment and its so emotional especially Chewies reaction.Now the only issue I have with this one is its basically the same story as A New Hope and it hits some familiar beats in its story and I just wish I would so something different.My favourite moment in this is definitely when the Lightsaber calls to Rey its such an interesting moment and builds up the mystery behined Rey.
I also like when she's fighting Kylo and she finally uses the force to focus herself the music makes that scene amazing.Verdict 9.6/10 fantastic movie which introduces a new generation of heroes and a new story to move forward with. It does hit alot of familiar story elements to A New Hope but its alot of fun."

No acting, no logic, no pretty girl, no characters and just Disney stealing money."

" 2015 Is When Star Wars Died
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,2,And I certainly will not waste one minute watching or attending or caring for the so-called Episode 9.The Force Awakens is very ironically titled. It is a pathetic gender switch remake. The actress is quite sordid. The story line is ripped off and pathetic and we are all being fooled by Disney's marketing power.Disney is now a juvenile puppeteer and Star Wars is a joke.
" Looks Great But Horrible Lapses In Story Logic
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,7,"Ok so this movie starts off great. Nice visuals, Kyle Ren stops that blaster shot and a very nostalgic introduction to Rey. So we're all set. Then things take a downward turn in logic and the cracks widen the further we get into it. Rey is given an illogical amount of insight into Force power without any answers as to how she's able to do what she does. And don't give me that read the books or supplemental info crap. Movie info should be contained in the cinematic story. Then we get to the Finn character and his sudden amazing prowess on the lightsaber. All this and a craptastic fate for everyone's beloved Han Solo and we have a mild disappointment. That's not to say it isn't fun if you put the whole script lapse on the back burner. JJ Abrams certainly knows how to make a good looking turd however. So turn off your mind, relax and flow downstream in a warm puddle of piss. Beautifully shot and a good cliffhanger too."
" Reboot of A New Hope
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,7,"Who are we kidding, this is a retread of A New Hope. It's fun and interesting, but it's not original or worth the long wait. Lucas was a visionary storyteller, but selling to mega corporations like Disney, was not a great move for the fans. I enjoyed this film, but it is not even remotely close to Lucas's style. Say what you will about the prequel saga, at least it wasn't recycling plots, or replicating story beats. Another Death Star. That was done in the original saga. Great range of characters, but this is only for the masses. The sequel would deliver an original storyline and leave us in some interesting places for the concluding episode."
" Hard for Disney to do wrong.. the film sells by nostalgia alone.. HOWEVER
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,6,"The cringe factor is strong, Its simply a disney formula written & approved by people with no knowledge or care for the original.You could simplify how silly it all is like this:Finn gets of the ship, bumps into Rey, they then bump into the Millenium Falcon & then bump into Hans Solo & chewbacca."
" Solid revival of an incredible franchise
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,7,"Taking a step back and viewing The Force Awakens, the film isn't all that bad. Many things were left up for speculation for it to be solved in the next two films of the trilogy, which is expected considering how incredibly popular and beloved this franchise is. Thinking back to when it first came out, everyone loved it because they were excited for where it would be taken from there. And I think that's what makes this film passable. The feeling of revival to this franchise is exactly what it needed.
It's no wonder that the film is quite similar to A New Hope, Disney wanted to play it safe to please everyone. In my opinion, I think the two films are separate enough to justify The Force Awakens' existence. This film's job was to create these new characters, and establish the time setting in the universe. I believe it succeeded as the characters are well done, and the time period makes sense in the context of the rest of the franchise.
Obviously there needed to be cliffhangers and unanswered questions as this is the first film in the trilogy. By the end of the film, the remaining two films have the opportunity to go anywhere which is what kept people looking forward to episode 8. When you take the unfortunate existence of episode 8 out of context when watching the film, it can be enjoyable and will feel faithful to Star Wars. Let's just hope Rise of Skywalker is able to fix up the damage done by The Last Jedi."
" Je Suis Une Mary-Sue
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,1,"Et je suis fier.What a boring remake. Everytime Disney remakes its films (including gender switches) things become more and more juvenile. It is only 6-year-old who become interested in these cash cows.Disney, what would happen if you had a woman with flowing feminine hair in your movies?"
" Revisited the movie for Rise of Skywalker
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,4,"I started watching the sequel trilogy again so I could go watch rise of Skywalker with good knowledge of the story. So onto my thoughts about the movie.This movie Is just boring.I can't find any other word for it. It's not a bad movie, but it's not a good one either. Some of it's characters, like Finn and Kylo, are pretty compelling. But some, like Rey, are completely boring and uninteresting to watch.The movie uses a lot of nostalgia to get old fans hooked without making much sense. Also the dialogue and the acting can be infuriatingly idiotic at times. And after the 3rd act the movie just goes full Disney, meaning that It uses stupid jokes at every chance they get.Overall, a mildly entertaining movie. As I said, not bad, not good."
" I hated this film
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,2,"A Stars Wars child who grew up watching the films as I did, but please do not let the director or these kindergarten actors touch anymore Star Wars films they suck."
" They have no idea what they're doing
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,7,"Spend a billion on the CGI... And hire entirely the wrong people to handle the trilogy.A lot of people weren't happy with this movie. But we all said..Well... Maybe the next one will make some sense of this nonsense..Lightsabers giving visions.. kylo talking to Vader's force ghost?No explanations.. cause they never cared to follow anything up, cause nothing was ever planned."
" Made Star Wars A Series For Losers
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,2,"What do these Hollywood types see in JJ Abrams? That he destroyed and gentrified Star Trek and Star Wars?? Is he holding certain photos of certain people? Is his alimony to his ex-wife so large he absolutely needs to crush and destroy dreams and art in order to make dough?Star Wars in The Force Awakens is just an inferior copy paste with a magical Disney princess who can do it all for no reason whatsoever.The fact that the director, writer and amateur actors deny and ignore all Jedi and The Force conventions and still think they are special makes me gag."

" I WIll Watch Episode 9 if I happen to stumble on it on TV
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,1,"Otherwise,this film killed my appetite and interest in Star Wars. This film is genuinely bad. It is unoriginal, boring, and the actors and actresses make high school dramas look professional in comparison.

",2019-12-07 00:00:00,6,"Never been a Star Wars fan. I just want to see a fun action movie. And it is reasonably fun to watch. It has reasonably ok cgi action. It has some suspense, although very little, because it's a Disney picture, so you know beforehand it will never get scary, because otherwise this movie cant be sold to the very young kids, who are the biggest audience for this kind of movie.Adults can watch this Star Wars edition as well though. It's not entirely a picture only suited for young kids, because I quite enjoyed it. It is a bit silly now and then and I got a few laughs as well.It's only entertainment and it needs to be treated and consumed as such. So dont believe the hype that it's marvellous. But dont buy into the hate that it's rubbish either. It's only entertainment...I accidentally first saw episode 8 before I saw episode 7. My bad. Episode 8 is better in my opinion, so if you are lukewarm about episode 7, please do give episode nr 8 a try...."

" Mehh
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,4,"So I see they did some good improvements in movie as for the technological side of things (R2 replacement robot being able to move easier). It was also good to see some details such as food makin' scene of Rey. I like how they started as if the movie is just another Star Wars movie and slowly connects to Episode 6 and u realize that it's actually a sequel. Only things I'd complain about is that it felt as if we are watching the same scenario as the episode 4. Again there is a new hope like Luke in E. 4 (Rey), again the dark side seems to be so much powerful... I mean I can almost see the end of this triology after just watching the half of the Force Awakens.Btw, after the emperor died in the episode 6, how did the darkside rised again ? What is that interesting creature that is suppossed to be the new emperor lol?Another one, why the hell is that new Darth Vader boy killing his father Han Solo ? how dumb is it ? I mean at least give us a proper reason for that. How can a person kills his own father for some weird creature. This movies is like comedy, no reason for nothing at all. lol."
" JJ's A Tool
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,2,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens seems to get an awful lot of spammy upvoting . I used to see this movie in a more positive light, due to it saying 'Star Wars', but there's far more to it than that. For example, Kylo Ren's a pathetic and unsympathetic joker, and merely a ripoff of Darth Vader. I suspect the actors and actresses are not Star Wars fans either because if they were they would not participate in this."

And don't say that he copied A New Hope! That's the point of STAR WARS! History repeats itself( RHYMING)! Plus, it fits PERFECT with the theme of letting go of the past! If you DO have problems with the writing, you cannot deny that the film is executed almost flawlessly! That last shot is garbage though! Overall, greatest movie ever and JJ is a god....gunga ginga"
" A retread of A New Hope.
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,1,"I had such high hopes for Disney acquiring Star Wars. It seemed like they could do no wrong. But once this film came out, all of it was for naught. What you see before you is a carbon copy of A New Hope, but without none of the charisma, none of the grace. I could hardly believe the positive reviews and people praising it. Was this what we were waiting on? Star Wars was better in the hands of George Lucas. At least with him you could get something original."

",2019-12-01 00:00:00,9,"I was so excited when the prequels came, having always loved the original trilogy. I was a bit disappointed with them, but still enjoyed them. This movie brought back the magic of the originals, with a fresh cast and goosebumps at the returning characters. Not a perfect movie, but an awesome and welcome edition to the saga!"
" The Force Awakens
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,8,"The Force Awakens was a fun return to the franchise. It is very similar to a New Hope which is unfortunate but the benefit of that is it felt much more like the Star Wars we know and love unlike the prequel films. The new cast is good, but it was great to see the old cast back. Especially Han. My biggest complaint is that Rey could beat Kylo Ren in a lightsaber duel without any training. That was a big misstep. Other then that it's a very entertaining film.8.4/10"

I tried, I really did TRY to get into the story but some of the BLATANTLY dumb stuff Disney wrote into this story is so far fetched I might as well be watching a movie about dragons and snow beetles battling for control over a taco stand... really Disney. How about you put a little more thought into a meaningful and believable story that creates a tantalizing ambiguity as to how the movie will end. This is such a failurw...

" Mary Sue-ish Snoozefest
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,1,"Does The Force Awakens indicate the decline of humanity?Comparing this reboot with the original trilogy shows us how humans are now dumber and more superficial than ever.
This films acting is in the toilets, the director clearly follows the cliche-ridden outline handed to him by the executive producer, who has ran it through the commercialism computer, and so everything happens magically because that is what Disney is all about: catering to the stupid fantasies of 8-year-old girls who want to grow up to be princesses (and clearly ugly and angry)."

" Lazy blatant rehash with awful world building
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,4,"Imagine you're in an alternate universe. You are watching The Lord of the Rings for the first time ever, having never read the books.We start in the Shire, but this version of the film doesn't bother to explain what the Shire is. It also doesn't explain who Bilbo or Frodo are, or what Mordor or Sauron are. We're just told there is ""some evil guy somewhere"" and then the film cuts to someone walking around a lot over some mountains for hours.The ring isn't mentioned until 10 minutes before the end of the film and someone keeps shouting about how important Rohan is but we don't know what that is either. You finish the film still wondering when the hell they're going to start explaining the actual plot.The Force Awakens plot feels exactly like that. We start the film with a very basic, confused idea of what is happening and why it is happening and we end the film with the exact same feeling.On top of that, the film doesn't even bother to make it's very limited backstory make any sense.The Empire is dead, yay! Oh, but they're replaced by a ""fledgling"" group known as The First Order. Oh no!This ""fledgling"" small group is quickly revealed to have an infinite number of spaceships and stormtroopers, and they've got the resources to turn an *entire planet* into a giant laser gun that can immediately annihilate solar systems.Wait, excuse me, what? The evil Empire of old, which was apparently much more powerful according to the intro of this movie, barely managed to build one Deathstar spaceship. Even with their resources they didn't manage to hollow out an entire Goddamn planet into a Deathstar. WTF?Then we have the Republic, a galaxy spanning government...which is destroyed instantly and with no explanation by one shot by said Planet-Deathstar. Yes, you got that right, this massive government that was the result of all the other movies gets instantly killed by blowing up a couple of planets.They didn't notice the hundreds of thousands of First Order spaceships carrying materials to the planet in the same system being slowly turned into a huge gun. LOL.This paves the way for the Rebels...oops sorry, the ""Resistance""...a poorly funded and unsupported guerrilla group that our plucky heroes will predictably join.Why are they poorly supported and funded considering they are helping the Republic government that presumably controls dozens of other solar systems? Why is no one else in the entire galaxy outraged by the destruction of a bunch of planets?Errrr, no idea, let's just ignore that. PEW PEW LASERS UNDERDOG HEROES.If this all sounds very bare bones and yet very familiar that is because:The plot is extremely shallow, self-contradictory and there is absolutely no attempt made to explain anything at any point.The movie is a lazy remake that relentlessly plagiarises the original Star Wars movies while pretending it's doing something new.On top of opening with ""Guys it's Star Wars 1 plot again, just go with it, don't use your brains, GIVE US YOUR MONEY!"", the plot then introduces all our new characters...and then does nothing of note with them.We have Finn, a traumatised Stormtrooper. This is an incredibly interesting opening for him - a man forced to serve evil people, do terrible things, and witness death and pain that he is repelled by. What will they do with his character?Well, they turn him into the dumb comic relief. Again, WTF? The guy who's a traumatised soldier becomes the butt of silly jokes and even starts gleefully mowing down his old Stormtrooper buddies (most of whom are apparently innocent conscripts like him).The fact that Finn laughs and cheers while murdering his own ex-brothers in arms is never commented on, again showing how little thought when into this film. But to any viewers actually paying attention to the story, it makes him seem like a demented psychopath. It also shows a jarringly inconsistent tone, something which carried over into The Last Jedi and ruined that too.Then we have Poe Dameron. A hero who would be a solid character, if it wasn't for the fact that we never learn anything about him. He's just ""cool generic pilot guy"". Again, what's his background? Why is he a good pilot?Many people say things like ""There are background novels that explain these things"" Well, I don't care.This is a movie, it should be able to tell a narrative without the viewer having to spend time reading hastily-written background media designed to plug plot holes. You don't have to read 10 different books to understand The Godfather because the film isn't lazy.Finally we have Rei. Rei is basically a female Luke Skywalker, even down to dressing the same and living on a desert planet.In fact she's basically Luke if he was perfect at everything he did first time and had no personality. Like Luke if he was pushed into a generic food blender with some Spam and turned into a tasteless slurry.Anyway I will end the review there. I won't bother going any further. We have Kylo Ren (bland Darth Vader rip off crossed with a dumb teenager), Snoke (why even bother talking about him when TLJ didn't bother?) and some old faves like Han Solo who are only in the movie to sponge off older fans.If you're looking for a good Star Wars movie watch the originals. If you're looking for a good movie in general, watch something else. This one is good for effects and explosions and that's about it."
" The worst star wars movie

",2019-11-21 00:00:00,10,"Wow! ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" just became the Best Star Wars movie ever made since 38 years ago. George Lucas started from the very beginning, and now he's back, of going phase 3, for the new Star Wars movie, and somehow J.J. Abrams is involved with Episode VII. He did a brilliant job in Star Wars: Episode VII, I would have to say he should stick with directing, and producing Star Wars movies instead of Star Trek, I'm more of a Star Wars fan like everybody else who loves Star Wars. J.J. Abrams and George Lucas, great job and I hope you'll do a great job making Star Wars feel the force awaken again. May the force be with you. Always."

",2019-11-20 00:00:00,8,"I thought this was a more than decent way to start the new trilogy. I was expecting a little more but nothing will be as good as the originals. This movie is a huge step up from the prequels but does repeat some themes from the original trilogy. I thought the little details and look into the storm troopers was awesome. The movie is entertaining and a new spin on the series. I was really excited for this movie and for the next film to be a bit darker unfortunately the next film ""The last Jedi"" was an absolute flop and makes this film look bad because they are in the same trilogy."
" Awful
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,1,"Terrible story line. Can't believe they have this incredible opportunity to have Luke, Leia and Han reunited and completely throw it away.

" Force Awakened.
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,8,"Star Wars : Episode VII : Force Awakens is a monumental film for any film fan.Any one who loves cinema loves ""Star wars"".The first trilogy was epic. It transformed the film industry and created a world wide phenomena.But the Prequel trilogy crash landed among critics and even fans.My perspective was that film director George Lucas focused on bigger themes and scope forgetting the basics of the franchise in the prequel trilogy.The basics was simple.The first trilogy was all about character depth and all the huge setting and background was just a support to develop the ""Star wars"" universe. He went vice - versa in the prequels.The new episode is fresh and keeps us tensed and the depth all around is outstanding. It reminds of the past and nostalgia is consumating and amazing.New characters and old gives the fans an amazing reboot.And it is J.J. Abrams monumental achievement of being able to reboot the biggest Sci-Fi franchises in the industry. And he did it amazingly. Both ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" is head to head now."
" Can we just stop counting this as Star Wars?
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,1,Disney obviously just sees this franchise as a cash grab. They don't care about art. They don't care about story. They don't care about originality. They don't care about George Lucas.Just because they own the rights doesn't mean that they can contribute to Star Wars. They own it in name only. You can like this as EU but it is not Star Wars.Stop Disney from raping Star Wars and stop giving them the money to keep doing it.

" Can I copy your homework? I'll be sure to change it so they can't recognize it.
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,7,"It saddens me that this sequel dips lower than the prequels in originality. The directors and writers were so insecure and scared that the only way they thought they could make this a success was to copy ANH. As a result, character become imitations of greater characters in the past.This movie had its moments, mostly visual. The acting and cast lacks charm and synergy that the OT had, The PT had the same issues, although it being a little more severe, the sequels still suffer from this to a certain extend. It's a combination of taking itself too seriously, and trying to squeeze in some funny moments. In addition the actors are too strong and fast learning, especially the main character. Where is the development?Because the formula is practically the same as ANH, I can't rate it a 1, or 3, or 5.. The acting from some is still decent, the visuals and cinematography are fantastic, it certainly stands above the PT and at times above the OT. Soundtrack is still good. Action scenes are well done.At the end, I wasn't bored throughout, but it left a bland taste in my mouth afterwards. Because it was so uninspired.Is it in many ways better than the PT's TPM? Yes. Is it original in the slightest? No. Is it better than ANH? Not even close."
" How many droids did Disney use to get this to 7.9
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,2,"Most of the top IMDB movies are violent, serious and depressing. There are barely any genuinely happy films in the IMDB top 300. That's ok, that's just what humanity tends to enjoy. That's why Star Wars always stuck out to me as a saga because it ends with peace in the Galaxy. It stood for hope, the triumph of peace in the end over war, good over evil. Han Solo was the ultimate hero. A likeable rogue, a vagabond, who never seemed to want to do the right thing, but reluctantly did it anyway, saved the Galaxy, married a bloody princess.What does this movie tell us 40 years later. Han and Leia the other massive hero from the original films had a ""We need to talk about Kevin"" introduction to parenting, Leia hit the booze hard, their marriage fell apart, by the way the whole universe fell apart again, ten minutes after the Return of the Jedi and we find Han hobbling around the galaxy in his 80's still wheeling and dealing with Chewbacca, just before he's murdered in cold blood by his problem child.The plot of the movie is almost identintical to A New Hope. Imstead of attacking a flaw in a Death Star, they're attacking the flaw in a Death Planet, that by the way wipes out all the planets that we became acquainted with in the prequels. It tells us that basically everything that happened in the previous movies was completely pointless, the galaxy is ruined again, the New Order is in control. The metacritics who scored it so highly should be ashamed of themselves or at least discontent with their bribes and the mighty George Lucas should realise his wonderful story has just been destroyed now forever."

It's not the best film ever made but neither was the original but it's fun to watch and really gets my inner 7 year old star Wars fan feeling going. But on a serious note, it's a film franchise about wizards with laser swords with edgy teenagers, men in White plastic armour and aliens that look like anything from hammerhead sharks to teddy bears, stop taking it so seriously, critic it by all means but if you don't like it, it ain't gonna kill ya."

",2019-10-29 00:00:00,8,"I thought this was a great return to form after the prequels which were rather disappointing, I think there are some very good things about the new upcoming trilogy, I think Kylo Ren is a very good villain as it's a change from Darth Vader and I think he written incredibly well. All together: very impressed"
" 9.3//I don't care, I love it
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,9,"10 years later from the hated star wars prequel trilogy, this nostalgic movie gets back and it Don t disappoints, with a new hope references, a magical pure directon from JJ Abrams, New great carecters, a great universe expendeition and incredible fight scenes, The Force Awakens gets back in the high way, being for me one of the bests"
" JJ's cool.
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,8,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens seems to get an awful lot of unfair criticism nowadays. I used to see this movie in more negative light, due to its lack of originality, but there's far more to it than that. For example, Kylo Ren's a relatable and sympathetic villain, and far more than just a ripoff of Darth Vader. Aliens is also a great movie even though it incorporates similar story elements to the first movie."
" Star Toilet
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,1,"Star Wars has become Star toilet and is stupid and disgusting.
An ugly girl who is as attractive as the next butch comes to space and beats Han with her skills!
She is aided by a clone stormtrooper who has figured out the stormtrooper uniform never protects against shots and has taken it off to reveal he does not look like the original copy.
In the meanwhile the emergence of a new empire is not explained nor is the existence of any characters. Why should they even try? People will show up anyway."
" An adequate return for the franchise.
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,7,The movie recreates the nostalgia of the first original movies in the story wars saga while also creating a new set of characters. The movie has some spectacular visuals then I felt it could easily be compared to a new hope. Overall though the film was pleasurable and is a must see for the general audience.
" Good
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,8,"Amazing visual effects and I like the new characters Rey and Fin and its fun to see the old ones old;) I only did not like the bad guy, the son of Han, I did not like his acting, it was a little bit to fake for me. But over all nice movie!"
" Probably the most anticipated film of this Decade.
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,7,"Star Wars Episode 7 while boasting a great cast, wonderful visuals and a fantastic score from John Williams. Fails to take the franchise to any new places, or live up to its predacessors."
" Aswesome comeback
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,8,"After ten years, this movie brought new life into the star wars universe. The pacing is Incredibly fast and exiting. I was not bored for a second. Visualy its stunning, the soundtrack is great and the new charakters are interesting. The only downside, another death star😑."
" Sigh
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,6,"I put a 6/10 by respect for the two first saga but seriously... what a crap! Swimming leia, Han Solo the legend killed by a crying baby, is this a joke? Where is the scenario? I think this ""movie"" is a commercial for toys"
" Lies, Lies And More Lies
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,1,"If this film is a sequel to anything then Donald Trump was truthful when he said he remembers Pearl Harbor, that he saw Muslims dancing in New Jersey celebrating 9/11 or that he didn't pay off Stormy Daniels out of his campaign funds (two months before his lawyer admitted he did)...In other words episode VII is a rip off episode IV and JJ Abrams and his goon enablers at Disney know it.Let's assume that they will reboot it again around 2025 but the gender switch that time is it will be an androgonous being retreading Luke's steps."
" Enjoyed it
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,7,"Star Wars is iconic and always will be, Lucas bored everyone to death with the last 3 which revenge of the sith was ok, Episode 7 was entertaining at least and gave han, chewy, leia and the falcon. All characters did a good job, maybe not brilliant. You want Laurence Olivier or Meryl Streep watch another movie, this delivered as far as i'm concerned, didn't think much of the The Last Jedi, too long and the disney influence in certain parts i didn't like at all. But to give 1 or 2, 3 is ridiculous, i mean really...all the work that goes into these things...i'm looking forward to Rise Of SkyWalker."
" Yet Another JJ Abrams Commercial
",2019-10-18 00:00:00,2,"I wonder if JJ Abrams actually respect himself because no one else does. Yes, he makes money and I am sure lives in a nice Hollywood mansion, but respect? No way. What is this? How dare he and Disney destroy Star Wars? Why are they reenacting the original with inferior cast and the mandatory woman instead of a man? Isn't that itself discrimination?"
" Derivative garbage
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,1,"Not only a remake of A New Hope, but a terrible film in it's own right. Even worse than The Last Jedi, which is saying something. Makes the prequel trilogy look like the original trilogy in comparison."
" Disappointing (Not As Disappointing As Phantom Menace, Though)
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,3,"I remember being very disappointed with this movie. The trailers definitely had everyone amped. But then watching this, it was really clear, we were watching a re-hash of earlier Star Wars films. JJ Abrams with his trademark lens flares didn't even try to create anything new or special, just another Death Star story.
The worse part was Rey. No character arc at all. She just magically becomes a pilot capable of flying the Millenium Falcon, AND a jedi fighter on par with Kylo, who supposedly had a lot of training under Skywalker. No build up, no learning. She was instant hero. A sign of our times. Even Luke didn't become an expert fighter after 3 films, and Rey was able to fend off someone trained as a Jedi. And why does Kylo need to wear a mask? Is it because he so damn ugly? Because that doesn't make sense either. Just another Darth Vader rip-off character, but without rhyme or reason."
" A disgrace to Lucas canon Star Wars, this film won't age well
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,7,"This film was essentially a cheap rip-off of Episode IV. It wasn't as good as A New Hope because Luke was way more interesting than Rey, Obi-Wan was actually in it for a long time unlike old man Luke who was only in this film for about 5 seconds with no dialogue and Episode IV wasn't so feminist and focused on shoving a barbaric political agenda down our throats. Whilst it was a cheap rip off of A New Hope, A New Hope is a very good film so this film is still good enough for me to give it a 7/10, however that doesn't necessarily mean I'll consider this canon in the long run, that all depends on how good Episode IX is.The positive aspects of the film were that I enjoyed the mystery of Rey and Kylo Ren, they made those characters nice and mysterious in this film, giving us a lot to think about. But overall the film isn't brilliant as it suffers from a lack of great characters, lack of plot complexity, a lack of emotional weight largely due to the insignificance of the new boring characters that have barely any personality except Kylo Ren and the film also failed to give the viewers enough backstory about how the First Order came to power in the first place. I know many complain that Rey was overpowered in this film, but I was willing to forgive that in this film alone (not counting TLJ) as Kylo Ren may have also been very poorly trained by Snoke and Rey could be another Chosen One for all we know so I was willing to accept Rey's power in this film for those reasons until The Last Jedi came out of course.Han's death should've been far better for such a legendary character, we still know very little about the backstory as to why Kylo Ren exactly left his parents to join Snoke so basically for that reason I just couldn't connect to the death scene very much at all because I really had no idea how awful Han or Leia might have treated Kylo in the past. It's still a good movie, entertaining in many parts, some good action sequences, great special effects, a similar plot to A New Hope and decent acting but this film largely lacked the two most important things a film needs which is a great plot and great characters. All of the new characters except Rey, Snoke and Kylo to a certain extent, were soulless with little to no personality, of course they're going to be boring because of that. Snoke was a good character, mysterious and I hoped he was Darth Plagueis or Darth Jar Jar or both Jar Jar and Plagueis but unfortunately Snoke got very little screen time in this.The severe lack of references to the Prequels and Prequel characters in this film also really disappointed me as I'm a big Prequel lover, they made this film for older fans who hate the Prequels, they played it safe and didn't get creative and fortunately for them it worked out quite well but myself and many SW fans of my generation will never love this film or TLJ."

Firstly, the story. What story? They ripped off the old episodes in order to reboot Star Wars for preteens.
Secondly, the actors and actresses. Where did they find them? At Sith Agency Supplies? I am not angry that we were stuck with such bad casting. JJ Abrams taking Ridley whatshername off the market does all of us a favor. I am angry that I spent my time and anticipation thinking I will watch Star Wars when I watched Manhater Wars.Isn't Kathleen Kennedy angry that JJ took her money and rented a couch for himself and Ridley?"
" Stupid

It is not Star Wars however when all the rules of Star Wars, Jedi order and the force are violated. I guess they went out of the door with George Lucas' $4 billion.There is a cure for the stain and disgust that this movie leaves on you: go watch the original trilogy fast."
" What the hell happened to you JJ?!
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,1,"I love the new Star Trek movies (at least 1&2, the third one is actually pretty bad) but unfortunately I hate to say that JJ completely blew the new take on the Star Wars Universe. This movie is truly bad!The characters are poorly written and have zero depth, every single one of them. The humour is bland, there's no emotional depth, its all action and no reflection.
As for the main plot, well it's a 1:1 copy of the very first Star Wars (A new hope), but so much worse it's laughable. What is this, seriously? And where the hell does this New Order come from?! And what happened to the rebellion? Did the screenwriters watch the previous (chronological) trilogy at all?Oh my god, what a dumpster fire... Avoid at all cost. Shame!"

Along Rey's pathway, she meets new and old reprising allies, when the ""Episode 7"" story kicks into gear with Harrison Ford, after 32 years giving legendary character ""Han Solo"" once again.""The Force Awakens"" directed by also producer J.J. Abrams has the classic ingredients of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy as the 'Millenium Falcon' swings again through narrow tunnels on planet into space, proving that leading character 'Rey' is a gifted pilot herself.The ending becomes mystic and grateful; It pays all the respects to George Lucas' conceptional vision of 1977. A movie to remember and enjoyed by hundreds of millions viewers worldwide."
" Do you like original bands or cover version tribute cloners?
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,1,"This film is a cover act with no originality or soul.
Star Wars was a classic of film and cinema,"
" Star Wars crash-lands back into people's consciousness's, not with a bang, but with an oddly detached re-telling.
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,6,"There's no time travelling in Star Wars, is there? No, didn't think so. Watching ""Episode 7: The Force Awakens"", however, the much anticipated 2015 continuation of the original trilogy, you would think you'd been thrown back to 1977 and were watching, in some alternate dimension, a re-run of the very first film itself. Sceptics have been writing for years on the 'place' Hollywood blockbusters have in the canon of film as an art-form, deriding them for being derivative, or for too often coming to form replications of each other, but this really does take the space-cake. The film is, in fact, so reminiscent in certain places of Episode IV that you might just as well call it An 'Old' Hope.The film begins with a mother-ship's silhouette blotting out a sun and the launch of a series of spaceships which head down to a nearby planet. The bigger ship, belonging to The First Order, which has risen out of the ashes of Darth Vader's old Evil Empire, in doing so infers a powerful ability to blot out or ruin anything it comes into contact with. Inside one of the smaller ships, the populous is cleverly introduced via some flickered lighting, which actually alludes to a later crisis of conscience one of the inhabitants will have. Once on the surface, they ambush a village with connections to the Resistance in looking for a piece of a map which will, apparently, direct them to the legendary Luke Skywalker, who, being the last Jedi, will win the war for the Dark once and for all if they find and kill him. At the last moment, a pilot called Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) hides the portion inside a small robot who escapes with it.Enter the protagonist, Rey (Daisy Ridley); a young-ish orphan, who should probably look grubbier and uglier, living on the same planet and who trades in scrap from crashed spaceships of the first war for portions of food. Her literal harvesting of these parts from old cruisers of the first three films is, in some ways, a reflection of how the film itself is taking from past efforts. Into her world ambles said droid and the map, and then later still the character of Finn (John Boyega), who is a storm trooper for the Dark but decides to change sides. Finn's introduction to the film, like Rey's, is a slow unsheathing of a mask or helmet to reveal the face in close-up, inferring a kind of duality or connection - sure enough, they spend the majority of the film together and become close allies.Dodging the incoming First Order, the two make off with one of the more famous pieces of Star Wars paraphernalia which they find lying around in the area, Rey demonstrating piloting skills you would have thought were beyond her without the ability to practise to any degree. After breaking down in outer space, they are caught up by two familiar faces in Chewbacca and Harrison Ford's Han Solo, who have become, in the years since the war, interstellar versions of long distance truckers. Their haul on this particular occasion are large man eating squid-like monsters. Do we think they'll escape and wreak havoc, or not? What do you think? The film then becomes somewhat of a race to rebel HQ, with the villains never too far from their tails. Later on, attention shifts to a weapon of mass destruction the First Order possess which, despite existing in the shadow of the old Empire, is ten times more powerful.The film is not a disaster by any means, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I think it probably attempts to cram too much in for it to feel like a work of real substance: the decision by a trooper to defect; a sub-plot to do with a father/son relationship; the foiling of an evil scheme; the rekindling of two old flames in Solo and a certain Princess. Its approach is too pulpy to take seriously; I felt its introduction of Rey and her lonely world, a stretch of film that is told visually without dialogue for a about two minutes, could have gone on for another ten, while its finale is similar to, but probably not as thrilling as, 1996's ""Independence Day"" with its final assault unfolding in conjunction with a dogfight.Then there is the issue of one particular cast member who had already said he didn't want to be a part of the franchise after this edition, so his character has been written out. This is sad for the fact we lose an old face, yes; but it also demeans the artistic pursuit of direction and damages the concept of auteurism. When decisions to take a project in particular direction are made by these means, and not by a creative vision, just what are we even left watching?Essentially, ""The Force Awakens"" is a re-treading of Lucas' initial 1977 effort: the message being hidden in a droid; the Vader-style villain in black turning up with his troopers looking for it; the young desert-dwelling hero bumping into it; the stumbling into an intergalactic adventure; the tracking shot through the Cantina-style bar, etc. What is new is not even necessarily new either: a post-Hunger Games style heroine and a post-Wall*E style droid hardly blow us away. For all the crowing on increased diversity, read Manthia Diawara's 1988 essay 'Black Spectatorship: Problems of Identification & Resistance' on black and white characters sharing the screen for problems linked to John Boyega's casting. Diawara's observations of things in ""48 Hours""; ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""Rocky II"" might just as well be applied here, particularly during the climactic lightsaber fight. What ""progress"" has even been made? In the end, JJ Abrams has created a decent actioner and provided us with the buzz of seeing some old faces, but nothing much else."

" If You Don't Cry
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,10,"Nearly four decades after 'Star Wars' fever hit the world for the first time in 1977 and initiated 'The Skywalker Saga' (1977-2019) with 'The Original Trilogy' (1977-1983), and thirty-two years after 'The Return of the Jedi' (1983), the original cast is back in 'The Force Awakens'. A seventh episode that marks the beginning of 'The Sequel Trilogy' (2015-2019), which is about to close the 'The Skywalker Saga' with the release of 'Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker' on December 20, 2019.
Star Wars is political, and it always has been. The Empire is a white supremacist organization that wants to dominate and destroy all known worlds and civilizations. Each episode is a powerful allegory and parable about fascism. A rallying cry to stand up and fight back Nazis all of kinds wherever they invade in the universe. A sumptuous cinematographic fresco painted by a team of visual artists who enlighten, inspire and bring the impossible to life, while upholding the right to difference and equality regardless of origin. A standard of universal love that teaches who our real families and allies are regardless of blood and traditions.
In this extremely emotional episode, if you do not cry when Han Solo and Chewbacca appear for the first time since 1983. When Princess Leia shows up after 32 years. When the son Han had with Leia kills his father, and when Ray finally climbs up cliffs and finds Luke Skywalker with all the wounds and scars he has accumulated over time and fights, I don't know how I can explain to you what Star Wars was, is and will forever be."

" A pretty solid movie... I don't understand the sudden hate
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,8,"The Force Awakens, seventh episode of the Star Wars franchise, debuted in 2015, and I remember all the hype and how everyone was excited, after all, Star Wars faced a hiatus of 10 years, the last movie was Revenge of the Sith, in 2005. But most of the people were excited to see Luke, Leia and Han again in the big screen, and know what happened to the galaxy after Return of the Jedi. In the opening week of the film, I remember all the buzz. Critics are good, the audience loved, and everybody wanted to see what'll come next to Star Wars. Well, 4 years later, and I decided to rewatch the movie. Like in 2015, I enjoyed the movie. The movie is well directed, thanks to JJ Abrams, the writing is fine, the pace and the editing is amazing , the acting was on point, the visual effects are astonishing, but that is predictable, and from my point of view, that makes The Force Awakens a good and enjoyable movie, how I said in the title, it was solid.But I was surprised when I saw the user reviews here. Just negative reviews and desnecessary hate on the movie. I knew that The Last Jedi is controversial, but I didn't expect to see the same hate on Force Awakens, I mean, I remember everyone loving 4 years ago. One of the most criticized aspects of the movie was the lack of ""original ideas"". Ok, I see, Tatooine = Jakku, Rey = Luke, Death Star Plans = Map to Luke S., First Order is the new Empire, Kylo Ren is the new Vader, I guess, and the Death Star returned, now as the Starkiller Base. This is understandable, the film would benefit from more original stuff, but everyone here is just seeing the negative side. Rey is a good character, and although her is not developed as it could, this the first movie of a trilogy, characters will grow and we'll their journey. Kylo Ren is fine, but lacks from real motivation and a REAL personality, Poe is not developed at all, Finn's arc will be developed in The Last Jedi, I mean, what's the problem again? The trio of this new trilogy is not as charismatic as the original trio, but that doesn't make them bad.The film has more flaws, as it have more good points, but everyone now is just seeing throw the bad one. The Force Awakens is a good movie, feels like Star Wars, is a deserved return to the universe we know and love, and don't deserve the hate it's getting. I think that with the time, this film will be more appreciated, it's no Citizen Kane, but it's a enjoyable blockbuster and a great Star Wars movie."
" pointless JJ remake
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,1,"JJ is at it again. I found The Force does not awake to be boring and pointless.
It was a unoriginal remake of A New Hope, with unlikable new characters, like the idiot droid BB8 code name for the beach ball 8. Who has no class and will never beat C3PO and R2 D2.
The classic characters are wasted. And my favorite character is murdered in the most obvious badly written way as a cop out.

" lots of ""moments"", mainly for the sake of having moments.
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,5,"Edit - there's actually a good article, ""JJ Abrams is bad at making movies"". worth a read.I'm a star wars fan. a big star wars fan. not the biggest in the world ever, but hey.4 5 and 6, the films. I was 2 in '77, so didn't get ""the original cinema experience"", but anyway.1 2 and 3, under rated in my opinion. yes they did everything on a computer, yes the dialogue was (slightly) forced. no, Artoo (probably) doesn't have rockets in his legs, but under rated films.Now the force awakens has been on the TV a few times, so I've seen it properly, and I've seen it on TV with adverts littered. I've read some of the top reviews, which said it was a reboot of A New Hope, and...I don't disagree.it's a tricky one. A star wars film could barely live up to the hype of the news of a star wars film. my mum didn't think a lot of it, she thought it was just star wars, remade (she's ok with the ""star wars"" franchise).""A New Hope"", ""The Force Awakens""the titles sort of mean the same thing.so we have.....a secret message given to a droid, to get away from an attack, a bad guy in a black cloak wearing a black mask with a voice synthesizer, a desert planet, a cantina, a person quickly saying ""I wish it was another death star"", so the viewer doesn't dwell too much on the previous statement which says ""so it's another death star"". Some of this might be based on the expanded universe. I have to admit, I've not delved into the books much. I tried a couple of them, and they really didn't do much for me. The action translates better for film for me, than into books. Some slightly cheesy lines, ""I can fly anything"", ""while there's light, there's still hope"". Also....Rey has almost no training, but apparently can take on Vaders grandson in a light sabre fight. I'm sure all of these things have been said many times.The ending was cool enough, just discovering Luke. it's a beginning, rather than an end. Also in the title scroll, it mentions ""The Last Jedi"" - fair enough, that's a precursor to Episode 8.One niggle I have, is that apparently everyones name has 3 letters. Rey, Poe, (Fin), Ren, Hux. BB8. Apparently we all have 3 letters. Ok, Snoke is the exception. Skywalker, Vader, Chewbacca, Threepio, Tarkin, Palpatine...mmmm....better. Biggs? well, maybe.Special effects, can't fault them. Since about the year 2000, computer graphics could do anything. Since about 2010, computer graphics could do anything, and also didn't look like computer graphics. So with Pacific Rim (enjoyed), Transformers 2 (enjoyed), Independence Day Resurgence (bit nuts) and so on, ""epic scale"" CG is as about as big as it gets, hopefully it will be more about design and memorability, than just ""scale"", and putting in scenarios for the point of being able to make a special effect (Maul's lightsabre I can definitely go with, Kylo's?...as someone said, it would chop off your fingers).Occasionally you want special effects that don't cost much - eg, ""force extracting"" information from someones mind.4 5 and 6 (deliberately) had the ""used universe"" feel. in 4 5 and 6 everything did work, so seeing wrecks lying around in TFA takes the the used universe one step further. this is an added touch though, and shouldn't be seen as the premise of the film.Episode 1 2 and 3 were all about preparing a story, they definitely weren't designed to be stand alone films. People have said about Rey possibly turning to the Dark side, about Ren's progression from 'petulent' to 'developed character'. Episode 9, the last Episode.....really?I do truth be told find it a bit odd that both franchises (Star Wars/Star Trek) now have the same director. It's a bit like one person saying ""Tories, Labour (or Republicans, Democrats), I'm in charge of both of you now"". I mean strictly speaking, I understand why George Lucas wanted to wash his hands. He'd been doing SW since 1977, Episodes 1 2 and 3 were a last hurrah for him, and he'd basically ""had enough"" of it by now. but....there are other directors....yes? maybe not Michael Bay, he'd just blow everything up for the sake of it, and we know that doesn't always work."
" A Disney princess that is 2015 ugly
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,1,"But not as ugly as the rest of the reboot film.Poor Jar Jar Abrams he just remakes and reboots.
They even have a death star here with the very same flaw is the earlier ones.
LMAO"
" This is not a reboot
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,3,"I feel like this movie was treated like a total reboot of the franchise instead of being a sequel. And it is a sequel. It's a direct continuation of the story, although it feels completely unnatural and not true to the original trilogy's ending what-so-ever. The new characters are cool at the start. I mean watching the first few scenes of the movie is almost orgasmic. As a Star Wars fan, that's everything I could have asked for. However, the movie changes during its course. It's one thing to be mysteriously powerful, but a whole another to just completely destroy anything in your path. There is no build-up of anticipation after a certain point is reached. You can just assume the main character is always going to prevail no matter what, and despite all odds, without even breaking a sweat. It would be fine if someone had to work for it, but the characters are just handed everything they need, and buffed to meet their opposition whenever it's required. No character arcs, just immediate power changes. It's almost funny. Still a great watch and much better than its sequel. Its effects are astonishingly well done, but the fight scenes need better choreography."
" Enough remaking Disney
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,2,"Enough remakes and sequels Disney. It is too much. Enough is enough already.

The galaxy might have millions of stars but we're stuck watching these idiots blow each other up and shoot each other with laser guns. Is that all people do in this galaxy? Yes I get that this is Star WARS and not Star PEACE but these people still have lives right? They must have industry and jobs of some sort. I'm sure it doesn't matter. These movies are made for people who like big video games, not practical jobs. That's why so many Stars Wars ""fans"" (who hate it anyways) look like children in adult form."
" ""The Force Awakens""? More like, ""The Force A-Weakens""!
",2019-08-23 00:00:00,4,"""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" (2015), what a horrible excuse for a ""movie"" this is. When I was a kid, I was obsessed with the ""Star Wars"" saga, including the prequels. Why do people hate the prequels? People should just take their heads out of their butts and enjoy them. But those movies are going to be reserved for different reviews for another time. Even to this day, I'm still a big ""Star Wars"" fan, except for the new sequels currently being made. When I originally found out that there were originally nine novels, and there were supposed to be nine movies, I got really excited! For the longest time I hoped they would make Episodes 7-9. Then after awhile, I thought: ""there's no need to make those three movies, the saga is perfect and it's a complete story. What could they possibly add to the franchise?"" Then when I heard Episode VII was being made, I got excited. I thought: ""okay, they have had plenty of time to write the script and put this movie together, it's going to be great! Right?"" Wrong! It all started going downhill for me when I found out that George Lucas had left the franchise. Then as I entered the theater, I thought: ""maybe it can still work, if they just follow the original novel!"" I have read all nine novels, and know how Episodes 7-9 are supposed to go. ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" is literally a complete rip-off of Episode 4. Jakku is a carbon copy of Tattooine, Rey (I THINK THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HER NAME, IT'S SO FORGETTABLE) is like a discount Luke Skywalker, Han Solo is a discount Obi Wan Kenobi, Kylo Ren is an insult to Darth Vader, and..... You get the point! It's like they took the script for Episode 4, changed the characters names, and just altered their lines a little and that's it! The only good things I can salvage from this ""movie"" are the special effects and the soundtrack. I was looking forward to seeing the original trinity of Luke, Leia and Han together again. But no, and now Han Solo is dead, Carrie Fisher who played Leia has died, and Luke is no longer his real self. I was furious about that, it was such a wasted opportunity! ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" is such a terrible disappointment! I give this ""movie"" only 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from this ""movie"", just go and watch the real ""Star Wars"" movies (EPISODES 1-6) instead. You'll thank me later!"

" One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,1,"I remember that day 3.5 years ago...I was so excited to go watch this movie after reading all the positive reviews 'Star wars is back!' 'as good as the original trilogy' the critics praised...and it had 92% on RT.
And then it started...the first 10 min were not bad,I thought 'yes! this is going somewhere!' and then our new 'heroes' were introduced - Rey and Finn, I couldn't feel any sympathy to either of them whatsoever, They kept running around here and there and this where I started looking at my clock and realizing 'It's a trap!. I thought 'ok,probably when han solo will show up this thing will get better' but it just got worse...Han felt forced and it was clearly a nostalgia gimmick to make more money. The Villain Kylo Ren was like a spoiled teenager with daddy issues and didn't come any close to Darth Vader. anyhow,it kept going on and on...for some reason Rey had super powers and could use the force whenever she feels like it (huh? why? who taught her this?) and eventually this nightmare ended with some silly action scene i don't even remember. Even John Williams's soundtrack was pathetic and forgetful.
To Conclude it was clearly a money milking movie of Disney which worked at the time (after the last jedi ppl woke up and realized what they should have when the force awakens came out but they were blinded by the nostalgic effect) which in my opinion was one of the worst movie experiences ever.
To be clear, I've seen as well 'Rogue one' 'The Last Jedi' and 'Solo' and while all of these were bad movies they were not as bad as 'the force awakens'. Yes, Even The last jedi was better then this. why? because the much hated Rian Johnson at least tried to change something and not just recycle step by step the old trilogy. Jar Jar Abrams just copy/pasted every element from the original trilogy which imo is just pathetic.
Disney ruined Star Wars. I consider The Phantom Menace a masterpiece compared to the force awakens. Yes, It had jar jar binks and that annoying kid but at least it was creative, at least it mentioned something about the force and had a master-disciple story, at least Lucas was moving on and trying to create something new.
Jar Jar Abrams/Disney didn't care about this, They don't care about the story of the force and what it means. They care about money and by being so greedy they made one of the worst movies ever made."
" Complete trash
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,1,The worst film from Star Wars series that spits on fans and lore and pretty much everything.Better save your money for collection of old movies rather then support this piece of trash from trash factory Disney.
" A real shame this movie was so bad, or else it could have been good
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,4,"If you pause the film and just look at the screens it will give you more joy than seeing it run. The script is so bad, even the prequels contributed more to the universe than this utterly unambitious film. Even though it contains some worthy scenes, the story and plot will just make you sad and angry. And people are saying Abrams saved the franchise from Lucas, but even on his worst Lucas managed to add additional valuable lore to the saga, while Abrams gulps up a remake with bigger explosions!
This script makes me sick."
" At Least Next Time Place A Pretty Girl In Yoru Film
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,2,"Look Disney if you have a remake that is trying to reboot a franchise and make money etc. at least compensate your lack of ideas and novelty or originality with a pretty girl or two we can ogle.
What is the point otherwise? I am a man. If the story is a standard issue gender switch from Hollywood at least put the girl in a mini skirt and give her long hair extensions so I can enjoy that and not feel my money is being stolen.

" Congratulations! Disney has stolen your money!
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,2,"Disney bought LucasFilm from George Lucas and immediately saw a cash grab with the Star Wars movies. They tried with one of their one franchises ""Tron"". But it didn't make as much money as they wanted it to, and Disney is all about MAKING MONEY!So we have this film. The Force Awakens. The only reason I saw this film in IMAX was because I wanted to spend time with my family and I was trying not to believe that Disney would butcher the franchise. They butchered it. They destroyed it.In the opening crawl, you can see most of the problems with this film. ""Luke Skywalker has vanished"". WHAT? Why? I thought we were done with that EVERYBODY WANTS LUKE storyline after Return of Jedi. Also, how does this film connect with Return of the Jedi? Now there's a cult of villains called the First Order, which is a terrible name by the way. Led by the irritating Kylo Ren and annoying General Hux.Honestly, when I first heard the line, ""Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the force."" I nearly kicked the seat in front of me. But I couldn't since someone was sitting in it. Because I was thinking: ""Why would you diss Anakin like that movie??""The story is a 98% copy of a New Hope, and I know most films reuse some material for new generations of characters like Rocky (1976) and Creed (2015). But with Star Wars, since it's such a great franchise, the whole world expected more! Luke is absent for 99% of the film, and we're stuck with Rey, who is a Mary-Sue. And Finn, whose a character you want to pick up a blaster and shoot yourself.I thought they would go the route of the Expanded Universe. But Leia is not even a Jedi on this one. J.J Abrams explained why, but it was the dumbest reason ever. All that building up from the original series of Leia, just to have her stand around and bark orders at the ""Resistance"". (Which is a dumb name by the way).The only reason why this film got a good rating on Rotten Tomatoes was because of its Special Effects. The movie is pretty much trash anyway. The most annoying part? My younger brother and family annoys with with how great they think it is. I'm probably one of the few people who realize how bad this movie is. And don't say it's a good movie because it's better than The Last Jedi. Because they are equally bad. They're just horrible. Save your time. Don't watch this film!"

" As close as you can be to do a remake
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,1,"I'm a huge fan of Star wars but let be honest here, this movie have basically the same scenario than episode 4.What I like about the movie:Their is a lot of action and we have the chance to see the original trilogy heroes even if we just see a little bit of Luke (not enough). I also like the fact that they drop down the CGI effect so the movie feel more like a Star Wars movie and the special effet in general are very good. Plus they introduce some new charater that seem to have some potential.What I hate about the movie:First... The story... It's basically the same story than episode 4 with a new droid, a bigger death star, a new kind of vader an what it semm to be an older emperor etc. So yeah it's the same story with little changes... I mean you can't be lazier than that.Then a new hero that dosen't need to train to be as powerful as Vader or Luke, seriously I can't imagine an idea that would make sense to explain how powerful she is... She can use force power whitout any training at all and that make Anakin and Luke weaklings compare to super Rey.And the famous map to find Luke... Why the hell do you need a map? It's space! Just give some coordinate and that's it... It is so stupid I can't beleive that a team work on this and this is the best that they could come up with?!?!? Seriously?? They don't deserve more then a McDonald paycheck.The fact that a lot of people like this movie only show that to make a Star wars movie that people will like you just need some action, good old school speical effet old and new species and some mystery... Yeah the old mystery box all over again... Thats the oldest trick in the book but it work everytime... ""Who's this mysterious Snoke? Where did he came from?"" ""who are Rey's parents?""Anyways I gave it 2 Star because their is some worst movie than that even worst Star Wars movie like The phantom menace and the clone wars or the holyday special."
" Screw the bad reviews this movie is great as it can get
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,10,Don't really understand understand the negativity for this movie I found this movie to be really enjoyable now it's not as good as the original trilogy but it's been than the prequels the characters are great change such as kylo ren Rey Finn bb 8 captain phasma but my favorite has to be Kylo ren I just loved Adam driver's performance as him and I love the final fight scene with Rey and Finn at the end of the movie I thought honestly Disney did a great job with this movie and the flying scenes has great cgi and special effects and the reason why this movie is made by Disney is because George Lucas sold star wars to Disney because he is retiring from making Star Wars and some of the original cast is back too such as Luke skywalker Princess Leia Han Solo c-3po so honestly I thought this was a amazing movie and the bad reviews are so negative and extremely selfish so at the end of the day this movie is a watch.

" Space opera at its worst. Do you need to graduate in Cinema to make such a bad movie?
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,2,"I've never been a fan of Star Wars. In my teens, watching the initial trilogy, I found it uncreative and childish. But it had an interesting ambiance and it recycled very well the themes that were already explored by the cinema of heroes for decades. And have great caracters. A solid 6 for entertainment.
In perspective, now comparing with this absolute idiocy with great CGI, the first trilogy seems one of the great moments of the space opera cinema. No character is minimally interesting here, except for Harrison Ford's and perhaps Carrie Fischer's.
It's high time to think why Holywood produces such mediocrity fest and abysmal production with no original ideas."
" An excting but also unoriginal love letter to the Original Trilogy
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,8,"Disney's debut and return of Star Wars to the big screen is a fun, thrilling, and visually stunning crowd pleaser. Its characters are extremely likeable. Its jokes are very funny. Its action is thrilling and visually stunning. The acting is very good. There is a lot to like about this film without feeling bogged down at all as the film moves by rather quickly. Despite this there is a major plot hole towards the end of the film, also the film lacks any form of originality. This film despite its unoriginality is an enjoyable love letter to the original trilogy, and just like its predecessor is endlessly rewatchable."

" Starcrash
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,5,Possibly the most incompetent script ever written for a major motion picture sequel. It's completely wrong to call it a rip-off of Star Wars - it only steals the message-in-a-droid idea and then just goes into a morass of pointless coincidence and plotless sequences until they decide to blow up the Death Planet at which point the story much more closely resembles Return of the Jedi - right down to the father/son confrontation intercut with the fighter attack. The new characters are however quite lovable and they honestly deserved a better story. There are way too many unexplained introductions of icons from the original trilogy (Why is the Falcon there? How did she get Luke's lightsaber?) and it just seems like the filmmakers couldn't be bothered figuring out how to make it all make sense and just gave up.

" An Awakening

A New Hope and Return of the Jedi were probably the best of the series in terms of story, tone and humour. Thats until now. Screw nostalgia, the only thing which made the originals good is the time of its release and how revolutionary the trilogy was. The Revenge of the Sith had far much more action and story progression. But The Force Awakens blows it out of the water for action. Humour is a little more grown up and much less cheesy. It does seem like the same old rebels attach the spaceship scene which was the focal point of new hope and empire strikes back. And another lovechild turns bad so for originality its lacking in the plot. It does have a good tone in terms of the legend of the force and all the stories of the great battle. The First Order has emerged welcomingly however and I look forward to a much more grown up series with action like this one."

",2019-05-27 00:00:00,9,I just rewatched Episode 7 and maintain my opinion that I really like it. I looked through the IMDb reviews of this film and cannot believe the hatred for this film. It seems that some people just hate for hatred sake. The biggest complaint that I see is that it is a rehash of Episode 4. I have to agree that it is very similar to it but after the absolute hatred that was unfairly bestowed on the prequel trilogy I knew that this would be a big budget fan film. Which it is. I am not bothered by that. George Lucas was criticized to the point of ridiculousness about how Episode 1 thru 3 weren't like the previous trilogy that there was no other way to.go. Does episode 7 break new ground? No. Does it harken back tl.the reason i.love Star Wars? Yes. That was enough for me.

This movie is rubbish, childish, and well crafted to make money only.
The film is incredibly stupid with joke after lame joke, Mary Sue, rip off and a horribly lazy plot.This movie will make you hate Disney, and remind you how terrible JJ Abrams is. If you actually like Star Wars you will demand Disney go the way of the VHS.It is safe to say that J.J Abrams has fulfilled his mission in bringing back Star Wars to its former glory! Cannot wait for Episode 9!Rating: 10 out of 10"
" This inferiorgender switch remake is almost as bad as Dotard trump's hair implant
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,1,"But yeah, nothing to see here except mindless, tasteless troll garbage from troll garbase master Jar Jar AbramsMove along and go watch actual amazing Star Wars films, like every single one before 2015!"
" Truly shocked at the high rating on this one.
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,4,"I viewed this in 3-D at the cinema, which was some experience but as a movie it contained little surprise whatsoever. Although it's a harp back to the look and feel of the original star wars release (which was a nice idea) and contained two of the major stars, Ford and Fisher; the rest was pretty much routine. Perfect in every detail and manufactured for something to happen every 2.30 minutes, there is no room for mistakes and certainly no room to breath. Great films have depth and personality but star wars as a global brand and worth 100's of billions, has become just about as synthetic as R2D2."
" Disband Disney
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,1,"Everything coming out of Disney's greedy studio is crap.
They made a joke out of the superhero genre, they made their endless princesses ugly and now they destroyed Star Wars.
Sadness.
Imagine a so-called Star Wars film episode 7 that totally ignores what happened in episode 6. Now imagine no more. It is called The Farce Awakens.
There was an article on the net a year ago about JJ Abrams last wife. At least she must be happy."
" I might know a bit the reason why this series has fascinated everyone.
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,8,"Although it was the first time I watched Star Wars series, I was so excited! Above all, it had a really nice pace! I felt it was like comic for boys.By the way, it must have not been only me who was surprised blowing Kylo Ren's cover with disarmingly simplicity."
" I Rather Watch the Dotard's home video boinking Ivanka than this
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,1,"All cashing in, no soul.If you want to call your film Star Wars, but are happy to leave the existential matter behind, it creates a product without much of a value.."
" Even for a Star Wars Movie, It was Bad
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,2,"Some awful casting, bad acting especially by John Boyega, weak character development, and it relied on Star Wars cliches rather than a good original story."
" Tired
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,4,"This is getting old. Nothing matches the quality of Episodes IV, V, and VI. My expectations are shot to heck at this point."
" Stupid and Lazy!
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,4,"Just another rehash movie. Abrams has yet to come up with an original idea. I gave this a 4 only because of the special effects people. Jar Jar Abrams has ruined every thing he touches. Star Wars, Star Trek. I'm sick of light flares and characters, aside from the original cast, I just don't care for. Even the original cast seemed to have been brought on simply to sell tickets."
" A New Hope 2.0
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,4,"This movie was literally a remake of A New Hope. The story was technically the same but different characters which are not convincing at all. And to think people hated the prequels oh they were wrong!!! The movie could be entertaining but for being the first movie of the new trilogy it definitely let so much to be desired. The other huge mistake was that the 3 main stars (Han, Solo, Leia) did not interact with each other being that this was going to be the last chance for them to be together in a film."
" A good star wars movie
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,8,Didn't know what to expect going into the theaters but came out really excited and interested. The plot was driven pretty well and the set ups look set set for a really good conclusion. Was into the movie and enjoyed the action and the overall story.
" Not Sure if this is worse
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,2,"Or The Last Jedi. They are both bad. One is a copy/paste (this) with a mary sue chick. The other one is a lacksadaiscial attempt at a movie with impossible physics and no clue.
I don't dig these films.
Star Wars sucks."
" Just Like Jar Jar To Mess This Up
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,2,"I hope JJ Abrams made enough money to feed that ex-wife he keeps bringing up.Plenty of time this didn't make sense, but clearly, adults are dragged by pre-teenagers. Why? I mean aside from the pre-teenage stupidity. I didn't see the sense in drinking being such a center piece of the movie."
" A Wannabe New Hope.
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,1,"This movie is heavily borrowed from Star Wars IV: A New Hope, but with a woman character instead of a man. Tatooine is too overused maybe, so they created a new dessert planet for this character. After the success of the Rebels, they have to create a new Empire. After Vader's death, there is Kylo Ren (so badly written, so cringe-worthy with a 30 years old character). After 2 Death Star being blown, somebody still have a nerve to create Starkiller.
I mean, why?"
" No One Comes out looking Good Here
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,2,"After the sell-out to crappy Disney by George Lucas every single invitee showed up to 'star' (cough cough) in this. Luke, leia, Han, et cetra all said 'yes' and showed up. Not one of them has the integrity to refuse to drag Star Wars' good name through the mud.
That Jar Jar Abrams would show up, wag his tail and obey the CFO of Disney was never in any doubt, but it was disappointing to see how sucky this film is and how everyone has no integrity.
The Farce Awakens sucks."
" The start of the fall
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,1,"Well, they managed to take how much the prequels killed the majesty of the original trilogy and finish the job.Lousy main characters and a pathetic villain."
" Recycled Plot put a damper in this movie.
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,6,"No matter how well constructed this movie is, the plot is just too similar to the previous franchises. The writers made no effort to be creative, zero imagination whatsoever. No new enemies, no new challenges, instead, they recycled the old enemies, they go the easy route of reviving the Empire, now know as The order, so maybe they can sell more storm troopers and tie fighter merchandise? X-wing and tie Fighter are just lazily reworked, rather than designing something more radical, three decades should have made more advances in the republic! Sure they brought back the old characters and surprisingly they are just icing in the toppings and have little contribution to the overall plot, except for Leia to suit their political agenda of third wave feminism. The only good thing about the movie is fairly well act, special effects are great and some minor nostalgia values. If you are looking for something new, just skip this movie and wish it never existed."
" Movie Review By MsClashKing YT
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,8,"The Force Awakens is an Amazing film . It does nearly everything right , the characters are likable , the action is great and the story and music are just great like usual . 9.5/10 A+"
" Shouldn't have watched it
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,1,"It was boring and things were happening for no reason. The supreme darkside darth is defeated by a girl who doesn't even know what a lightsaber is and well resisted by a sewer scrubber.
This film didn't have any pretty girls with nice bodies either.
I am not sure I will watch anymore of these Star Wars films."
" Just one word ""disappointment""
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,1,"I mean... I was totally bleeding from my eyes. I'm a fan of 4-6 episodes of Star Wars, but this was just utterly disappointing. I couldn't watch it till the end and will never watch another Star Wars movie again, except for Rogue One, that one was good - probably because it was a side story and without that rund down last jedy-crap.But for this one:Actors Play - 2/10
Plot - 3/10
Squeezing every last drop out of a franchise - 10/10But now seriously... my eyes where bleeding..."
" They Call A Light Sabre A Laser Sword
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,1,Just bad.Pandering to a loser low IQ audience audience of early teens and children who drag along their hapless parents. This was just bad. Buy some Made In China plastic merchandise while you are there.
" Poor man's 'Star Wars'
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,2,Frustrating main characters that act against Star Wars and the force and Jedi knowledge and wisdom and makes stupid decisions to help Disney reboot this rubbish for preteens. They also continually break into comedy and one-liners despite being in a high risk situation under close watch. Could easily have been a children's TV movie.If the 8 rating on this site is justified and real then my mother is the queen of the universe and my wife is Charlize Theron but thinner!
" Like A Fart In An Elevator
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,1,"A big stumble backwardsI didn't like this false Star Wars: and I'm sorry. It seems as if the accountants were so focused on ugly shorthaired Mary Sues and clever-sounding lines that everything else suffered. There are plot devices that don't make sense, dramatic scenes which are undercut by out-of-place one-liners and inconsistent characters. After the prequels, I felt like The Force Awakens is vomit."
" The Worst Movie (it's by JJ Abrams, in other news water is wet!)
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,1,"I watched this with my wife last week and I have to declare that this was even worse than I ever believed possible.All the professional critics who gave this a good review must be getting gift bags from Disney. What was this boring, yawning, silly, stupid pastiche?"
" George Lucas Cared For Star Wars
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,1,"JJ Abrams and Disney do not. It is just an investment for them. This is why the galaxy's biggest plot hole and worst and most unemotional story collide and create a disaster that is called The Force Awakens.
Terrible. I am not watching any more 'Star Wars.'"
" The Wal-Mart Of Cinema
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,3,"Yes. It is that bad. Loser city. Rip off story. No Hope, no interest and no cool scenes. Disney is vomit and JJ Abrams is the nugget in the vomit.
Stay Away."
" Chewie, we're home...
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,10,"I really don't care what anyone has to say because I personally thought this film was nearly flawless. Sure, it's hard to say that it wasn't a clone of ""A New Hope"", but honestly, it's hard not to go back to old material. The Force Awakens was a thrilling and delectably exciting film that introduced us to fun and loveable new characters (BB8, I'm talking to you!), while simultaneously embracing the original characters. The film got us absolutely pumped for the next film which was an unfortunate misfire, but didn't matter at the time because of how good this one was.A+"
" Sucks
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,2,"I am objective on this. I know. I care. Therefore, I hate Disney Star Wars. I love Star Wars. This has none of the Star Wars feeling from beginning to end. The plot does not work. The chicks are Mary Sue are lame and feel inauthentic. The way we're introduced to each of the old classics was exemplary. This reboot is not. I hate it."
" Great!
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,8,"I'm not objective on this. I know. I don't care. I love Star Wars. This has all the Star Wars feeling from beginning to end. The plot works. The characters are well defined, are different from each other and feel authentic. The way we're introduce to each of the old classics is exemplary. I love it."
" The people who wrote the script should be shot
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,1,It was an awful photocopy of the original Star Wars (1977) movie.For gosh sake they are still using X-Wings? The Falcon can still fly rings inside the wreck despite being in the junk yard for years?And wth is a girl who doesn't know crap be able to fly it like Han Solo at his peak and wield a light saber like an expert? It makes no sense.
" JJ Did It!
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,9,"Yes, this film has obvious similarities to 1977's ""A New Hope,"" but its well written new characters breathes new life into the popular generational saga. Veteran actors returning to their popular characters offer feelings of nostalgia throughout. Well acted, emotional, and heart racing are just some of the ways to describe this film. Props to JJ Abrams. Lets us not forget the most important character of all: John Williams score!"
" Too Sad!
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,1,"Do people really watch this stuff? So twisted. No one film caused the hate and addition to remakes in this country, but Star Wars has enlarged the mess So full of half stories, bad acting and dishonesty. When will there be a Star Wars that is as good as the originals? This is too bad."
" Better than Last Jedi by a mile
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,9,A lot of people complained about the similarities between this and the original but I thought it was kind of a fun ode but still its own sort of thing. After seeing the horrifically awful Last Jedi I think we can all agree this one looks even better in retrospect. JJ Abrams clearly loves it and you can feel that and I think it's pretty great.
" All the feels
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,9,"Two words: loved it.
The feelings I got as a kid? Rekindled. The new characters? Awesome! The old characters? Oh yeah!
The visuals were amazing, the plot got me intrigued. Got no complaints about the acting, it all seemed to fit the individual characters imo.
Out of all of them, Rey definitely got to me the most. Her longing for a place to call home and for people to call her family and belong with is something I can understand, so I felt for her. I thought she was cool on screen, but you should hear my little ones - they were practically gushing about her (still are), and well - that sealed the deal. A new hero has risen.I DIDN'T like the rathtar stuff, but that's all I got for negative stuff. The rest blew me away."
" Bad comedy (the joke's on Star Wars)
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,2,"I am a big fan of comedy, jokes and practical gags. This film doesn't deliver so much. As far as fictional comedy I suggest The Hangover. As far as pure comedy laugh-out-loud that is a better recommendation. As far as dress up people parading around watch Spaceballs. The director and the dress up actors in this preteen reboot should try another line of work."
" For Fart Fans
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,1,"FFF!
The Fart Awakens and it stinks to high heavens.
Shame on George Lucas for getting old, wimping out and cashing out. I have the old DVDs. There is no chance in hell I would buy this on DVD after watching it once.
All involved should go under the knife and become sterile to make this world smarter.
Finn and Ray should be shipped to Sudan, Israel or some dump and left there forever"
" It definitely delivered
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,8,"Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J. Abrams. This film takes place over 20 years after The Return Of The Jedi. It was long awaited, but it definitely delivered. This film is everything you want a Star Wars film to be. It further deepens and gives purpose to the original characters, as well as introduces very likeable new additions. The action sequences are all incredible. This film really makes the most of modern CGI, but also does many things practically, which is essential for a Star Wars film. It is important that I speak about the new villain, Kylo Ren. This guy is awesome! He's such a deep and complex character. There is so much conflict within him, and when learning more about his back story, it makes you really view him as more than just an evil antagonist. The main criticism of the film surrounds the fact that it seems to follow and share similarities to the original trilogy, particularly A New Hope. I can see how perhaps they played it safe. But in my opinion all they did was improve on it and explore everything on a much deeper level. Star Wars: The Force Awakens contains such great writing and film making so therefore I give it a 9."
" I do not believe in god
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,1,"But I will become a calm and compliant believer if someone somehow frees Star Wars from the clutch of Disney. This was awful. Sordid. Stinky. Wretched. My wife and I did not wait to see who is the director until the end of the film. I got up and checked out the back of the DVD to find out. The film did not improve (actually got worse) and I am here now hecking out what else the man J.J. Abrams has done.
He is on our total avoid list!
The film smacked of marketing department approved trash all the way. Oh it was so cool 2019. I am being totally sarcastic. Wow. Give it up, Disney and Mr. Abrams.
I am older than 7 so cannot like this film."

" no no no and NO
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,2,"This boring pastiche was a weak attempt at rebooting Star Wars in order to suck money out of the franchise for decades. Unfortunately, they do not make sense and it created dissonance with the previous 6 episodes.
Star Wars RIP"
" Bad
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,1,"Everyone notices that it is a copy of the previous, and as a human I personally do care, the presentation of a Mary Sue as the love interest is a joke, in addition to Finn a joke character who looks nothing like his original and cannot shoot and is even unaware how an empire aircraft works and I want to know nothing else of him. The emo Keylo is hormonal ... I dislike it because it is a middle finger to all of us who expected a great villain opting for one who clones Darth Vader and lives in his shadow and we are presented a mediocre villain almost reminds me of what any Disney preteen film in this remake."
" Good
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,7,"Everyone complains that it is a copy of the previous but I personally don't care, the presentation of a female hero as the protagonist is very interesting, in addition to Finn one of my favorite characters and I want to know more of him. The villain Keylo is a risky ... I like it because it is a kick to all of us who expected a great villain opting for one who livesunder the Darth Vader shadow and is presented as a mediocre villain almost reminds me of what happened Metal Gear Solid in its second installment."
" What is wrong with you, people?
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,2,"Stop feeding Disney, Mr Rip Off and all these weak and stupid remakes and reboots and sequels. They suck. Really.Name one story within this film that was interesting. Name one character that was explained. Name one reason behind any of the actions. Name on pretty girl. Name one reason people watched this other than being on autopilot.

" TFA is A New Hope + Mary Sue
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,3,"This movie is awful they had all these years to create a new SW movie and instead we get a recasting of A New Hope lead by Mary Sue . Lucas must be banging his head against a wall for selling out. Abrams totally sold out to Disney there is NOTHING original in this movie it's just a redo of ANH lead by a boring Mary Sue and a hapless antagonist that's a JOKE Kylo ""cry baby"" Ren ."

" A huge return
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,8,"Although I'm not a great fan, with time I really became obsessed about this universe, and that movie is one of the bests, they have all the references, the olds characters (more evolves) and new ones pretty well work, the visual effects is nostalgic and so much better also, the story is totally understandable, and you really will enjoy this adventure."
" LAME

" Good stuff
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,9,Ignore all the sad little fanboys on here. A fun film. Lots of drama lots of action. Currently imdb rated as an 8 which given all the dubious low scores is outstanding. Sit back crank up the volume and enjoy.
" The Force Rehash
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,7,"Don't get me wrong. It's a fun movie. Great special effects, good action and likeable characters but it's also devoid of any originality to the point that it could be called a reboot. Also world building sucks and that Star Killer base was such a Deus ex machina. It was both taken straight from New Hope but also was a easy way for writers to erase all that happened between Return of The Jedi and Force Awakens.
To sum it up I don't regret watching it but I have no desire to see it again."
" It's a worse New hope
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,4,"This movie is complete trash.SIMILARITY
It's really similar to a new hope there is nothing new with it.
The beginning were Kylo ren kills a lot of people is similar to the beginning of a new hope.
Ray lives in a dessert planet with no family members is similar to luke but the only difference is that look had family who lived with them but they died later.
Han solo getting killed is similar to Ben kenobi getting killed.
i could be here all day explaining why it's similar but you can just check any other reviewer for that answer.CHARACTERS
Fin is a garbage character.
He has mental breakdown for some people then later killing a stormtrooper with a lightsaber and he is fine he has no development and he is to virtuous for my
taste.
Rey is a bad character she is not a mary sue but pretty clo0se to being one (if you wanna see a true mary sue watch wonder women) but she is an underdeveloped character with no personality whatsoever.
Kylo ren is a annoying cry baby that destroys everything as soon as stuff don't go his way.
And Han solo is uninteresting and his death was a pretty bad one cause i had no emotional interest in him.FINAL ACT
It was a mess bad action and the ending didn't really make sense.
yeah sure Kylo ren was hurt so that's why Rey could defeat him but Kylo is a better force user and i think it was said that you could use the force to enhance strength and Kylo could do just that but anyways maybe i'm talking crap.VERDICT
Hey at lest it's better than phantom menace"
" Oh Lord help us...
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,1,"Again, I was so excited when the these sequels were announced....WAS.The only redeeming quality in this particular movie, was Harrison Ford coming back. Nothing else. As much as I disliked the prequels, these new sequels make the prequels almost watchable. These new movies, especially this one, misses the spirit of Lucas's original vision. Its noticably more violent for some reason, and that was a turn off. Star Wars doesnt have to be violent...Sure, the original movies had some dead guys, but nothing like how this movie started, with execution. Its overall distasteful and has no place in the Star Wars universe. its supposed to be a fun place to visit....what I saw here, wasn't fun at all. The forced comedy, the overall rehashed plot, a Ginger bad guy who cant seem to use his inside voice, a chrome stormtrooper that literally serves NO good purpose.Im spent...signing off...."
" An incredible return to the Skywalker saga
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,9,"J.J Abrams's return to a galaxy far far away is a pleasant one with 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'. Returning the beloved characters of the Skywalker saga and showing what happened to them.The visuals are beautiful as is John Williams score, the brilliant performances also help with Harrison Ford fully channeling Han Solo, and not a grizzled Harrison Ford. The newcomers are very good as well with John Boyega and Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. The largest complaint I could even have with this film is the fact that despite the over 30 year wait for an Episode VII we get something very familiar, which is obviously intentional to bring back the feeling of Star Wars to fans, however the film becomes predictable once you see the formula, the film is still fun, and does have new ideas but overall you see the similarities. Despite being a very familiar film, it is heavily filled with fun nostalgia and a Star Wars movie that will leave you feeling like you're a kid again."
" If your new to Star Wars you'll enjoy it, if your a fan you'll hate it.
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,8,"First off let me say I've been a Star Wars fan for YEARS, I've seen the prequels, the original trilogy, and I've watched the tv series (clone wars, rebels, etc.) when I first heard about this movie I was really exited, especially hearing that Han, Luke, Leigh, and other original trilogy cast we're returning to their roles for the first time in over 30 years. Kyle ren looked like a really cool villain, with the crossed light saber, and rey seemed interesting, all in all the trailers looked great and I was exited. Then the movie came out and I saw it and we'll...mixed emotions. The bad: the story feels more of a reboot of Star Wars, with no real new story. The empire was defeated years ago, but just brought back again for the sake of the plot/ no new ideas. Stormtroopers, oh, and let's just add a bigger Death Star. Obviously very poor writing is shown in this movie. It feels like a joke, a parody of Star Wars. Still that's not to say I enjoyed this movie to some extent, the cinematography in some scenes is excellent, the space battles and action are every well done, the VFX was great, and of course the score by John Williams is brilliant as always. That being said the story, the plot, the characters, and the overall direction of this movie was a joke to me. I was hoping to see the story go in new directions but it didn't. Luke isn't even in the movie, Rey and Finn are these young kids who know nothing about the force, yet can go toe to toe with Kylo ren in lightsaber combat, can pilot a ship with ease, it's just an obvious mess. If you've never seen Star Wars and this is the first one you watch, you may enjoy it. If not, you'll hate it. For me I had mixed feelings but overall it was a mess."
" Nothing in this film for me
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,2,"The plot is a remake with worse actors, actresses and direction. The idealism is gone. The plot holes are obvious. There aren't any pretty girls that show skin. I am not really sure why this film would have any fans. Maybe gender switch completists???"
" The best part is....
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,3,At least they cast many of the original actors from the first trilogy. Not just Han and Leah butPeter Mayhew/chewwythe C3P0 guyAdmiral AkbarThats a cool thing they did.The movie however not very good. Took me three sittings to get through it. Just a mess with a story that didnt hook me in. Too Bad.
" Watching it again only because I don't recall seeing it before.
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,6,Oh heck I have seen this before (thanks to IMDB recording my rating) and I don't remember a thing. So either it is low on merit and/or I can watch reruns over and over be blissfully unaware I have viewed films previously.
" Jar Jar Abrams Shows up For Yet Another Gender Switch... How Original
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,1,"This is a creepy and unfunny movie. The Mary Sue has it easy and is wonderfully (cough cough) magical. This is Hollywood at its hammy worst. The joke of a cast barely bothers to make facial expressions. Harrison Ford is game, but has nothing to work with and the robot does what it can. But mostly I spent the movie cringing at the horrible script and Jar Jar's repulsive obeying Kathleen Kennedy's orders."
" Hated it
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,1,"To be honest since TLJ came out I now hate TFA. In itself the film was just an ok-ish film. If it wasn't starwars it would just be an unknown film. JJ did good, it was somewhat original but it lacked interesting storytelling."
" not great, not bad
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,8,"I actually really enjoyed this movie. Yes there are a lot of plot holes in the story, that story is pretty well the same from Episode IV, but they had planned to make the same story from the foruth epiosde. The best part of this movie would have to be the actors, they actually did a very good job considering what they were given. I do understand why a lot of people didn't like it. To me personally I don't mind that they hated it 'to each his/her own' For me personally turned out to be a good one. I do still prefer the original 3 over this one. I do find if you compare yes, this movie is utter crap, but if you don't compare it actually stands on its own as a good movie."
" Style over substance
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,3,"This was the first Star Wars film that I left the cinema feeling extremely underwhelmed. From the opening scrawl telling us that there is a mission to find Luke to when he finally appears, right at the end of the movie, there is just emptiness.
I was looking forward the great legendary Jedi being epic and what do we get? A beard on a windy island.
The story is a complete rehash of the original Star Wars which became known as Episode 4 A New Hope. Well, all hope has run out on this new trilogy. Absolutely no originality whatsoever. The effects were great but the story was drivel.
The Rey character was ridiculous and the black dude, Finn, is an overt coward. Finn makes no sense whatsoever. He is supposed to be a hardened highly trained stormtrooper that was schooled in soldiering from a very young age. What we see is a guy who suddenly gets a conscience, despite the years of ardent brainwashing and development of warrior brotherhood, resulting in him going AWOL. Whenever his soldier skills are needed he is utterly useless. Later on he tells us he was actually a janitor. Rey on the other hand is so kick ass it is astounding. And she is instantly epic in everything she does.
Han Solo is turned into a failed father who has not progressed in life at all. The only memorable thing about Princess Leia is her frozen face. It seems botox in a galaxy far, far away is as obvious there as it is here.
Yes, the film is stylish. Unfortunately, it's just a very poor rehash of the original and fails miserably in its girl power banality."
" Starkiller Base
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,5,"I wrote this short review to bring up an issue that I haven't yet seen anyone else mention, and that is: the UTTER STUPIDITY of Starkiller Base.Besides all of the really obvious issues (how the heck does it even propel? for example), the biggest inanity is this:If you drain a star that has planets orbiting it, you will effectively ALSO KILL THOSE PLANETS.In other words, all Starkliier Base needed to do was drain stars. Anyone inhabiting surrounding planets will die PDQ, if they don't board a spacecraft and get away."

",2019-02-04 00:00:00,8,"Just ignore the haters and toxic fanboys who just love to hate a star wars film and enjoy this movie, it's way more fun than those horribly aged prequels
yes it's similar to a new hope but it's not a remake of it because the characters and story its different, it's what this franchise needed the fans wanted a classic simple star wars and jj did just that and much more.the only two negatives i have is that it there is another death star again... and carrie fishers acting other than that it's a pretty decent star wars movie."

" Super average
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,6,"I tried this out to see if I'm still into Star Wars and it's possible I'm just not or not into sci-fi anymore. This didn't make me want to finish the trilogy that's for sure. That said I did really like Rogue One, they did a really good job with that one. This just seemed unoriginal and trying to play of the nostalgia factor having Han/Leia/etc come back. The end did surprise me though and for that reason alone I'll probably try 8. Oh and Rey was pretty hot so there's that."

" Rehash that again.
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,6,"Let me say the force awakens is a fun movie filled with action, drama and interesting twist. The problem it adds nothing new. It's basically a contemporary remake of A New Hope. It follows that movie basically plot by plot. And unlike good remakes it doesn't add any new weapons, concepts or ot points. There is an interesting new philosophy they began to add. But it does not forgive the overall redundancy the plot took.I would forgive this if I never read the books which added a wealth of content that enriched and expanded the star wars mythology. This movie does none of that. In that sense it reminds me more of the prequel trilogy than anything else. Dont misunderstand me the movie is better than all the prequel movies, but vastly inferior to the original.I hoped this movie would bridge that gap. It hasn't. However it is a good movie. A fun one. And the characters are lovable. You feel for everyone. It just feels a bit derivative. Cause here's my thing in a series one should be able to watch all back to back and the series should be fresh. I dont believe that The force awakens did that for the series. It's a good movie though enjoy."
" A mediocre movie.
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,2,This film takes the Star Wars saga and just throws it out the window. And a worse movie is The Force Awakens. It gets one star. And worse than both of these films are the three prequels. They are the absolute worst Star Wars films ever made.
" This Is Incredible
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,3,"It is incredible and takes a lot of talent. It is a case study. It is an example that will be discussed in film schools for years.Disney Corporation takes control of Star Wars and takes the world's best, most exciting, most highly regarded and intelligent universe and story and turns into the biggest sad joke of a sordid and pathetic offal ever.
How they can take an amazing and amusing message of truth, goodness and faith in the future and make it an exercise in corporate marketing immersed in the cloning and replicating with the world's silliest junior actors and actresses is a testament to the moral and ethical bankruptcy of cinema and Disney Corporation.It takes a lot.They did not even bother to acknowledge what the story line and events of previous Star Wars films were!!!"
" Makes a mockery out of the franchise...
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,1,"So many flaws it's hard to believe this movie actually got made, but I can't believe that some people actually like it when compared to George Lucas' work. This film gets so many thing wrongs when it comes to Star Wars. Star Wars has a certain feel, that this film just doesn't have, and everything that makes the series unique, and fun, this film emulates poorly or just turns a blind eye. They've made a mockery of a great film series, and they know fans will support it because of their love for the series, but Disney just doesn't have the direction to do it right. Instead they're thinking about what they can do that they can emulate and add rides to their dumb theme parks."
" The weakest of all.
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,4,"Perhaps countering the majority of the audience, I had very low expectations regarding this movie. I liked the two previous trilogies, but I was afraid that a re-launch would have as its main objective to raise a few million dollars from the studios. I did not feel cheated, the movie is good and worth it, but I must admit that anything is lacking to match the older ones.The film basically resumes the story decades after the events of ""The Return of the Jedi"". There are many new characters (inevitable), and some of the old ones are back, with the focus on Han Solo, a secondary character in the films of the original trilogy. I confess that it was very enjoyable to see the veteran Harrison Ford, back to a character who greatly helped to consecrate his career, and it was good to see Chewbacca and Carrie Fisher again. I think the new actors like John Boyega, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver did their best, but I do not know if the material they received allowed them to create characters as striking as the older ones.Technically, the film is flawless. The CGI, which has always been one of the strongest points of the franchise, has been pushed to the limit of what can be done today. Great and realistic, it makes the experience of seeing the film a visual spectacle. The sets and environments of the several planets were carefully thought out and executed. Costumes, cinematography, editing, sound effects and soundtrack etc... all thought out with caution, seeking to please new audiences without disappointing unconditional fans. It's all right.But the truth is that the film has serious problems. Let's start with the script, which practically copies and tries to update the story told in the opening film, ""A New Hope"". Kylo Ren, the newest villain in the franchise, is no more than a second-rate Darth Vader on a new costume. Indeed, despite the commitment of the actors, which I do not want to question, the new characters lack charisma and the ability to delight. I also felt that action is lacking, compared to the previous movies, and the attempts to make humor sounded as funny as the ""grandfather jokes"" that Roger Moore used whenever he played James Bond. The end also seemed a bit anti-climatic too.Anyway ... all these problems make the film, fatally, the weakest of all in the franchise to date. I didn't feel cheated because I expected little of it, but I believe that many fans (at least, those who have not been blinded by their passion) were dissatisfied."

" Why?
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,2,"How can this film have 8 stars on IMDB is beyond my understanding... Really sad. I had a Star Wars weekend and watched all six first films. Some I rated six and some nine. Especially I liked the Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005). It connected the old trilogy with the new one perfectly, no plot holes!!! It was packed with action, emotion, meaning.. everything! This... I felt betrayed. The beginning wipes out any meaningful connection to the saga immediately. Just another action film with some super powers. We have a new one every day now.. SAD... And I thought I'm gonna enjoy it! I watched it till the end, hoping. When it was too boring I let it run on the background while writing some posts.. It didn't get better. 2/10 stars"
" An Updated Sci Fi Spectacle that Doesn't Quite Reach the Original
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,7,"31 December 2015. In this reawakening of an old classic sci fi trilogy, a new generation is introduced to the original Star Wars (1977) phenomena and its moving onwards decades later. The audience is introduced to a new crop of rebels to a new younger generation of the Dark Force as well as the reemergence of original but older, aging Star War characters. The characters play out somewhat differently than the original with the charm of original Star War character interactions somewhat diminished in the newer plot outline. Harrison Ford continues with his charming humor, yet eventually its charm seems forced and a bit stereotypical, but even so his performance is charged with entertainment and delight. Carrie Fisher, now the reigning rebel monarch, presents a more mature yet captivating character whose presence continues to be welcome. The rest of the cast is mostly a rehash of the original Star Wars in similar guises but with a nice veneer of increasingly tantalizing special effects and 3-D imagery which however still has a ways to go to really push the potential of the visual envelope.This newer Star Wars version mostly depends of the theme that bigger is better, a literally bigger villain, bigger relic ships, retains the Western Space Opera concept and omits the original character development of the original series, especially Finn and the director's decision to have his character over-act dramatically to highlight his differences at the beginning of the movie. Superficial in many respects, The Force Awakens. There are echoes of the singular female dominance of Sigourney Weaver's Riply from Alien (1979) and large scale set designs of the alien space ship and the lonely trek of Wall*e (2008). Finally, it is hard not to overlook the mounting technological and illogical plot points that occur throughout the movie such as the over-reliance of singular fighter ships by The New Order to decimate villages and rebel positions, the artificial slow-mo lasers and energy blasters, and the ancient use of outdated metal ships and corridors something one might imagine from World War II submarines, the poor operation of sensors allowing characters and ships to apparently come out of nowhere, or the quite obvious rolling path of BB-8 droid which leaves one of the most trackable marks over the sandy landscape ever.Overall, The Force Awakens seems more like some memory or déjà vu, some vague but entertaining dream upon awakening in the real world. There are some fantastic vivid images, yet the dream doesn't quite seem to replicate the original awe and fun of the original or the epic nature of Dune (1984) directed by David Lynch or the more creative mind-bending sci fi of the new wave of movies such as Inception (2010), Another Earth (2011), Cloud Atlas (2012), The Congress (2013), The Host (2013), Oblivion (2013), Upside Down (2013), Gravity (2013), The Machine (2013), and Interstellar (2014)."
" OVERRATED FAR FAR AWAY GALAXY CRAP
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,2,Its a Shame that this franchise even exist this far far away. Let alone Billions of dollar its making.
" Lots to like, but re-boot feel and continuity gap is jarring
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,5,"The opening scenes of the film are just stunning, and the whole escape from Jakku absolutely nailed it for me. The wreckage from an epic battle combined with a familiar desert setting feels as though it was all carefully crafted to simultaneously provide the sense of continuity and nostalgia needed to draw you firmly back into the Star Wars universe 30 years later. Not an easy task, but for me personally they got it spot on.Things go down hill from there unfortunately. There's still lots to like, but a continuity gap with the originals and a 're-boot' feel just keep growing as the film goes on: We understand the First Order to be the remnants of the Emperor's most loyal servants, and yet they seem to have more military resources than the Empire itself. On the other hand, the victorious New Republic who have the resources of the entire galaxy at their disposal seem less well equipped than the rebellion of the Original Trilogy. Maybe nit-picking, but the New Republic don't seem to have assimilated any Imperial technology either, which is odd - we saw the Empire assimilating the military of the Old Republic, so why not the other way round?The overall situation is illogical and seems contrived just give us a story line very similar to Episode 4, which is a faux pas in itself.The Star Killer base (c.f. Death Star) also made the destruction of the senate of the New Republic something which just sort of 'happens' without any real sense of significance. It's arguably the most pivotal moment of the whole film, but you get no sense of that - blink and you miss it.Despite this film's many redeeming features, I had a strong feeling that it's sitting in no-mans land - somewhere between a continuation of the saga and a reboot."
" Original Diehard Fan with Mixed Feelings
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,6,"I'm keeping this short, but here goes....a) LOVED that we have a female being the major focus of the story. Ridley does a good job, and I really liked her.b) The FX and scenery were excellent as always, Star Destroyer awesome imagery.A & B are why I gave this a seven, This is really about 6.5/6.75 for me. It would have been a 6, but the tipping point was Maz. She was an awesome character addition and I wish there had been more of her. The character was under utilized IMHOc) HATE the fact that heroine's story is pretty much a rehash of original Star Wars movie (New Hope). I think JJ Abrams is brilliant, but WTF dude, give us new material, don't rehash old plot lines (he wowed me with 1st ST movie, but here he does the same thing he did with 2nd Star Trek movie, and you do NOT F*&k with the original Wrath of Kahn. Just don't!).d) Finn was like a funny sidekick role, but his character could have shown a lot more depth.He's got a lot of dark emotions that should have been developede) Kylo Ren I'm not a fan. The angst was too emo, which made him wimpy. I just wanted Rey to drop him every time. He was like a petulant little boy playing wiht the big boys. Didn't work for me. The backstory wasn't fully expanded on as to how he went dark. yeah you see what happened, but you don't see the total explanation, just superficial stuff. It just made the emo vibe unrealistic, unsympathetic and I couldn't connect with the character. I mean you can hate Vader in the first movie even though you don't know why he is so dark, but your reaction to him as a character is a solid emotional reaction of loathing. Ren just doesn't give you that. If you're going to be on the dark side, you can be redeemable evil. Apparently they don't know how to write that kind of depth. It doesn't help that I felt there was something off with Adam Driver either. CAn't put my finger on it, but the long robe garment didn't inspire evil either.f) Delighted to see Solo fall (long story)g) I loved the ending with Luke (Hamill has totally matured into a hero with major angst. You see it in his face when he turns around to look at Rey. That's great acting when you convey that.h) Carrie - Loved her as always and Gawd I miss her. She's just wonderful. Kick A$$ heroine even as she aged.i) Overall a decent movie, but they went with too much FX and not enough character development. But then I'm an author and I know how to do both.j) I don't know if Abrams wanted to take things safe because he was going into a powerhouse franchise or what, but I expect better of him. His reboot of the Star Trek franchise with Chris Pine was wonderful. I was expecting the same here and came away unsatisfied.All opinions are subjective, but so others will disagree vehemently, agree on some of my points, or all. It's about what works for the individual. But my opinions are based in the writing world, so I'll see things a bit differently"
" An unnecessary remake of Star Wars: A New Hope
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,6,"This is not a Star Wars sequel. This is primarily a remake of Episode 4. It is so jam-packed with original trilogy references and direct plot ripoffs, all trying to ram the nostalgia down our throats It gets to a point where it's actually overbearing and distracting from the movie. If you can look past that, it's a decent movie.My least favorite aspect of the movie is the total abandonment of the prequels. There are no scenes showing the full scope of the battle or any battle sequences occurring with non-main characters, which were easily the best aspects of the prequels for giving us a taste of the bigger picture.My favorite aspect was almost Kylo Ren, but his reveal happened far too soon. A character with potential to be extremely cool was turned into an angsty teenager. It almost seems as if he is a poor Sith because he mistakes his angst for the rage that a Sith requires. So instead, my actual favorite part was the lightsaber duel. Both of the characters involved have no reason to be experienced with a sword, and their lack of experience is really obvious on screen."
" amazing star wars for a new era, but Disney's controlling string are noticeable.
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Right so having seen this film several times both in cinema and now more recently 3 years on (can't believe it right) It stands up to the test of time especially after a sequel in the same time period has been made.One of the things i want to get off my chest before i go into how much i like my film is probably its biggest flaw and although most people already know it i believe it is worth mentioning as it partly defines the film.Similarities with ep4/5yes i know its part of the skywalker saga but the problem arises when you realise how much the similarities are and were they so obvious when making it?
here is my list.inheriting anakin's lightsaberOld war hero helping main protagonist on getting away from their old life and sacrificing themselves while confronting an old close relationship enemy after helping get rid of shields on a massive battlestationplanet destroying battlestation with one spot weakness to blow up. with countdown to it firingprotagonist living poor on a sandfilled backwater planet.droid with important information finding protagonist.bad guy with mask and cape.bag guys boss appearing as a hologram teasing future encounters, (a let down to be)the list could go on and on but there are a few really annoying ones,.okay so to finish off my negatives. the lightsaber is definitely misunderstood in this film. although Finn and rey can't use it properly and kylo is hurt, they should not be that effective at being able to wield it even with force sensitive powers. episodes 1-6 explain why no one else wields a lightsaber, due to requiring years of training to use.there may be some other negatives but beside what i've mentioned and po and rey apparently never meeting it is mostly good for the following reasons i'll list a few and then talk about whySpecial effects both cgi and practical look the best they ever have and are put to good usemain character castings and characteristics are amazing, finn rey poe even kylo are easy to believe and understand (i'll explain more on ren later)inclusion of han solo chewie r2d2 c3p0 Leia Ackbar is a good thing for continuity and nostalgia.xwing's and star destroyers albeit updated is great to see.jakku takodana, resistance base, star killer base all look amazing as locations.battle of jakku remains of imperial fleet looks amazing and ties in with the fall of the empire expertly.Story line is easy to follow its skips around planets a bit but jumps between characters feel natural and progress the story and arent forced.the story of rey and finn becoming something greater as individuals is perfect space opera in my opinion as is there growing as characters throughout the film.Okay so to talk bit more about why i like this film.Kylo is flawed but still menacing, from the moment he takes his mask of you realise he is pretending to be sith to both scare others but to convince himself. and this turmoil both makes him volatile but also vulnerable which is nicely shown when rey reads him mind during her interrogation. His lightsaber which looks very volatile sums his thoughts up perfectly.Han solos death is a good reminder that this film is not about the old characters and old ones help propel new ones along much like that of obi wan in the originals , still an iconic character but was around for less than a third of the original trilogy.Poe is a good character that shows that hope exists in the galaxy and he is a good reminder that the first order conflict is real he is also a good reminder of how inspiring leia is and how she rallies troops.Rey is the best part of the film in my opinion, Her character is that of someone who is strong in their comptencies and beliefs but is thrust into a world of the force and greater conflict. her natural grasp of the force is a great thing to see much like how luke started off although her use is more visual and a bit quicker in how she uses it.She denies her destiny in the flashback scene which i think visually is great. her connection with finn is fantastic and they bounce off each other amazingly as does the subtle notion that she can handle herself as a woman and why shouldn't she? which i think is a great message not being over the top but very inspiring for young viewers.I like the fact that the movie is happy to say the rebellion won in ep6 but turmoil is stil part of this universe, (it is star wars after all)
Luke's disappearance is a good reason for this as is the rise of kylo renThe amazing thing about this film is that it sets up for the send two films perfectly although the cliff hanger ending does unfortunately say there can be no time jump something every star wars film has had however small.it also sets up snoke the knights of ren and luke traning rey as well as kylo ren becoming stronger and an epic battle between the first order and the resistance.without talking about the last jedi too much looking back i am disappointed much of this potential is wasted and i get reminded about it too much watching tfa which is a real shame.
on that note the only problem with phasma is that the was hyped up too much before the release of the film. the reason a boba fett character worked was that he became a favourite despite his lack of involvement in the films which means phasma was being set up to fail.to sum up this film i would say that the effects are amazing and are pure star wars for me, the planets and ships all look amazing and its nice they're new. the old characters do their part well in passing on the baton as do the new characters in cementing their part in the world,You really root for the good guys in this film and although you mind always says its not as good as the originals it stands well on its own. unfortunatley disney probably said it needs to be a bit and star wars for a new generation which meant jj abrams felt complied to make it like the original to play it safe,i don't mind it too much but it probably the only thing stopping it being a 9 or a ten for me."
" Nostalgia Nostalgia Nostalgia
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,9,"If I'm being honest this is probably my 3rd favorite of all the Star Wars films including the spin-offs. The reason is, as my headline reads, nostalgia. I got goosebumps upon seeing all my old childhood favorites like Chewbacca, Han Solo, Princess Leia, C3PO and R2D2.The movie though is about the new characters with the characters from yesteryear just hear to support. Rey- is a young lady who's been abandoned on a crappy planet by her parents, Finn-a former Storm Trooper who breaks away from being brain washed while having a moral epiphany, Poe- an expert pilot who has a stubborn leadership quality to him and Kylo Ren-Han and Leia's son who's turned to the dark side to follow in his grandfather's footsteps as the new Darth Vader.As the story evolves, Poe steals a map that may help them find Luke Skywalker. Luke left long ago for a life of solitude. The Empire finds Poe but Finn helps him evade capture but they end up crashing on the same crappy planet as Rey. Finn believes Poe to be dead but stumbles upon Rey who has Poe's droid BB-8 (who actually has the map) . Rey and Finn take the Millennium Falcon from a scrap yard and eventually run into Han and Chewy (Goosebumps!) who then take Finn and Rey to Leia (more Goosebumps!). Han confronts Kylo Ren who kills his father!!!!! Rey ends up fighting Kylo Ren and we see she has some sort of Jedi power. They end up escaping and the last scene we see Rey handing Luke a light saber on a desolate island. Fade to black.JJ Abrams did a great job of getting the old fans excited by basically making a newer version of the original Star Wars: A New Hope."
" The Clone Wars
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,4,"I'm not an Abrams fan at all so have dodged this film until now fearing the worst.I went in with a very low bar of expectation, thinking I'd watch for the special effects. And oddly by the 30 minute mark, I hadn't fetched a bucket. I kept watching and it was all good.But... it is just a hybrid imitation. It is beautifully shot, with seamless CGI, with thankfully no annoying cut scenes. It's lovely to watch. The battles didn't fatigue me in this outing (they did in Empire, Return and all the other films). The film is nicely directed and balanced. Shock horror!However as a story there's nothing new here at all (but you can say the same since Empire). Solo and Leia didn't add much to the film for me apart from continuity. It's just sad that there aren't any stand out different storied chapters here. We've seen it all before.The price tag appalls me considering the end result. But it did cover the outlay, made money and employed many keeping the wheels of the industry well oiled. Other than that, it's pretty pointless meh."
" A force revitalized (or at least, replicated!)
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,8,"At last, after the unedining tedium of George Lucas's portentious prequels, J.J. Abrams gives us a new Star Wars film we can like, aided by Lawrence Kasdan, the screenwriter of 'The Empire Strikes Back'. 'The Force Awakens' is a fast-paced space-romp in the spirit of, and paying considerable homage to, the original movies, brining back many of our favourite characters while also introducing new ones (with a nod to modern political sensitivities). Perhaps its biggest problem is where it goes so far beyond simple homage so in places you could almost believe it was an alternative treatment for the script of 'A New Hope'. Of the new cast, I thought John Boyega seemed the most natural; the old cast do come across as old (but then, it was almost 40 years between the movies). The movies takes a bit of a while to find its rhythmn, and Kylo Ren, the conflicted villain, is interesting but not wholly convincing (although arguably Darth Vader had problems of his own). But it's fun, respectful, contains at least some new stuff and is arguably what the world was waiting to see when Lucas gave us 'The Phantom Menace' instead. Ah, well."
" Hollywood Needs To Get A Grip
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,2,"This is unimpressive. Most unimpressive. Scraping the bottom of the barrel. There was so much the director, writer and studio could do because there is a wealth of good material out there in Disney fiction, books and comics, but because they wanted to insert a Disney princess who is a Mary Sue they couldn't do that so instead we get this. Why remake a film that you know you cannot match and is readily available on DVD??"

The CGI and the music was fantastic too!I know there are bad reviews but you should not listen to them.

" Star Wars: VII Review 10/10
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,10,"Okay let me just say, that this is one of the best goddammed movies of all time, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens changed my life and inspired me to create and write my own short films, and i thank J.J Abrams for creating one of the most innocent and exciting movies of all time.30 years have passed and Luke Sywalker has dissappered and the FIRST ORDER has risen with the help of a ragtag group of heroes, and general Leia Organa's RESISTANCE, they set out to find Old Legend himself, also with the help from Han Solo and chewbacca the wookie, the acting was better than oscar worthy! They casted these characters so well and so accurately.I don't mostly get the hate for this film, its so good! so what if there's a black man in the movie, so what if the main character is a woman? and plus, the reason that Rey Beat Kylo during the forest fight, because he's beating himself and he's bleeding, and plus he's emotionally unstable after he litterally just killed Han Solo his own father."
" Easily the worst movie of the ""franchise""*
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,1,"Star Wars: The Farce Awakens is easily the worst movie of the ""franchise"". It fits in just below Ishtar and Battlefield Earth, and it is definitely worse than any of the other films of this century. The acting is is lame (unlike the originals), and it offers a stupid mix of gags and Mary Sue acting. This film is bereft of merit, and does not continue the story in a compelling way. It reboots it and clones it very badly (Mr Rip Off Abrams at work) that feels like a offensive continuation of the saga. I would happily fast for a month for Disney to stop feeding us this vomit inclusive of its ugly and angry Disney Princess. Someone give Jar Jar Rip off Abrams a job he is good at (car wash?).*The Embarrassment That Is Episode 9 should be out soon and make you vomit"
" Haters will hate, no cure for that
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,7,"I spent the last half an hour reading first few dozens of reviews on IMDb. Every single one was bashing with the rate from 1/10 (big majority) to maximum 4/10. Still, average rating on that same IMDb is 8,1. Conclusion - movie is not at all that bad as they wanna show it. Haters are a minority, but all haters have unbearable urge to bash everything they lay their eyes on, while the rest of us who liked the movie and who are in the huge majority, mostly do not care to write reviews. To be completely honest, most of their arguments against this movie are hard as a rock, it's all facts, but the final result is not a bad movie at all. Haters claim this is plagiarism of original trilogy. True, movie has one of the most appalling lack of originality I have ever seen, but I prefer to consider it reboot of the original trilogy rather than plagiarism. Yes, they made it to get some more money on old fame and, yes, everything in it we saw before, but still, it is nicely done and very entertaining movie. Maybe I fell on targeted nostalgia they cunningly used, but I really really enjoyed this show from the beginning to the very end. I simply loved it.7,5/10"
" Too Many Jokes
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,3,"Disney has subverted Star Wars into one of its lame and boring childish films aimed at selling toys to preteens. I am sure McDonalds was poisoning more people than ever before by hawking Star Wars toys from Disney.
Not a film for adults."
" Long, Long Ago...
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,10,"The perfect nostalgia bomb and a triumphant return to the roots of Star Wars - a family drama with laser swords and swashbucklers. Similar to Episode IV, yes. Amazing for it, at that."

" Under-written, overproduced, and derivative
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,1,"Continuing with the Lucas tradition of ruining Star Wars by nerfing violence and suspense with cartoonishness, this film is extremely CGI heavy, while ignoring the art, magic and realism of puppetry that first defined the essential exoticism of the Star Wars universe.While the casting is generally very good, the villains are a collection of baby-faced incompetents who just strike poses and say their lines.The writing seems to include pandering dialogue, as well as a dependence upon formulaically recreating the plot trajectory of Episode IV.""We just bought the rights to Star Wars! Quick, get me 13 producers and the director from Star Trek! Oh, and make sure we use a focus-group driven approach to film-making - what's that? Oh, right. 13 producers should take care of that for us!""I actually really love Star Wars, and I really like the director, Abrams. I just rewatched this after completely forgetting everything about it when it first came out, and now I remember why I purged it from my memory.It might have just been my imagination, but I got the impression that the main resistance pilot was super into Finn, and it was incredibly distracting, whenever they shared a scene."
" A Rerun With A Continuity Gap
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,3,"I am not the world's biggest Star Wars fan, but I have watched the old episode 6 (and the 2 before it). Star Wars: The Force Awakens is number 7, but in number 6 Leia, Luke and her resistance rebels were victorious. In this film they are again rebels and just have one base again and so forth. What is going on here?
The scenes are borrowed, but the acting is inferior also.
I am writing this and becoming confused. What happened?"
" The Girl Is Ugly
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,3,"I am not certain why this producers think I should watch their films. The girl is ugly and hostile. She has a chip on her shoulders. I have to work hard to earn money. When I go to the cinema I want a girl who both has it and flaunts it. Is it so hard to understand? If the girl is the same or in this case uglier than what I can see on the street, the film is a remake (or a rip off as officially it is not a remake) and everything as a result is predictable (including the 2015 standard issue gender switch) then why would they expect me to like it and come back for more? It is not like the cinema theater has good food and I want to dine there.By the way, why can't the chains offer better popcorn?? They charge enough to be able to provide us something better than styrofoam."
" The Force is Dead!
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,1,"A terrible mess!!! That ain't Star Wars, 'tis a toy box containing everything that the fans expect for a Star Wars movie, no creativity, nothing original, Star Wars is dead with Han Solo!!!"
" Just so-so
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,4,Perhaps I am not the biggest Star Wars film fan out there? I didn't have a father to take me to watch the original when it was released (and was probably not born yet). This film was not terrible exciting. It is probably better if you associate nostalgia with it. I am sure though that they gave character development short shrift.
" Easily the fourth best movie of the franchise
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,7,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is easily the fourth best movie of the franchise. It fits in just below the original series, but it is definitely better than any of the prequels. The acting is well done (unlike the prequels), and it offers a good mix of practical effects and CGI. This film isn't without its faults, but it continues the story in a compelling way that feels like a natural continuation of the saga. I would happily watch this movie again and I would gladly add it to my movie collection."
" So it was a.......

" Communicate with your friends

So I sat there and took the pain and endured.After we left the film, my buddy turns to me and says, ""If I had gone to this movie myself, I would have walked out and gotten my money back. But I didn't want to ruin enjoyment.""All I could say was, ""----."" Lesson learned people, communicate with your friends, check their temperate, are they really enjoying the movie? When you see one of the worst movies ever made or a film that should never be made, chances are that your buddy is in as much pain as you are. Don't endure bad films for your friend's sake without making sure they aren't just doing the same thing for you!"

" It's so good.
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,10,"I really recommend watching it. But if you're a very die hard star wars fan, please don't watch it. I wasn't a die hard fan but I still liked it because I loved the action and everything. I even liked the story. But for die hard star wars fan, some of them don't like the fact that some of the characters were useless such as Finn."
" What hollywood Shareholders Needed
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,1,The treasury department awakens.After the painful sell out by George Lucas to the evil Disney empire we get this modern day cliche-laden standard issue gender switch reboot that will inspire a whole number of accounting departments to demand even more remakes and gender switch films with simplistic story lines. It's a sad movie where Star Wars becomes a simplistic and childish film where everything happens too easily for the ugly Mary Sue. Don't listen to the positive reviews by Disney contractors in India and The Philippines it's a sad attempt at bilking cash from morons.That is all.
" Precedent-Setting Masterpeice
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,9,"This movie is of a different breed. It plays with the duality of characters, and keeps you guessing what kind of direction characters will develop in. I like that the movie has plenty of nostalgic reference to the first Star Wars movies, while bringing a ton of new content to the table. I find the parallels between the Nazi Regime and the First Order to add a lot of complexity and realism to the storyline."
" Something Very Wrong In Hollywood And The American Movie System
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,2,"Forty years ago a man named George Lucas launched a saga of fantasy, hope and adventure. It was inspired, but new, different and still original.Fast forward forty years and the system, output and control is dominated by people who just clone (remake/reboot/sequel), who have no love or care for the 'product' (Kathleen Kennedy, JJ Abrams, Iger, et cetra) and are mostly versed in marketing, launch, cost/benefit analysis and universes.Audiences have responded by pouring a billion dollar into a system that forgoes good acting, a semblance of story and a sense of originality for franchising, sales technique and cliches presented as modernism. No, let's not forget theme parks and co-branding with burger chains and car dealerships.Does anyone here think for one second JJ Abrams is a trekkie or fan of the force? That Kathleen Abrams has a clue what a Jedi is? That the regularly scheduled weekly gender switch film actually anything to do with originality and not because Hollywood studio execs actually do it as a matter of doing the routine? That any of this has to do with the love of film as opposed to cost projection analysis? Does anyone actually think it is a coincidence that every single super hero with super powers has become a comic and that children take their parents and watch them like they have attended a clown's comedy tour?The Force Awakens is a nonsense piece of frizzled offal offered by cynical self-important offenders. Yet, the fault is not with the pathetic pushers. The fault is with the audiences who attend, watch and purchase a movie that is nothing more than this week's gender switch row on an accounting balance sheet complete with yet another death star that has the same flow as three death stars before it and a member of a clone troop squadron that looks nothing like the man he was cloned from.It is time to go outdoors for a jog, to learn how to grind coffee at home or plant a tree in the backyard and nurture and tend to it until it fully grows. You know, doing useful and new things..."
" This Made Star Wars Fun Again!
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,10,"The Force Awakens isn't perfect entertainment and we should all stop pretending Star Wars movies as a whole have to be flawless(The Prequel Trilogy also gets held up to that kind of scrutiny, as well as The Original Trilogy). They're not THE films by which ALL movies must be compared to; films like Sunset Boulevard or Citizen Kane are more suited for that purpose to compare movies to because they were benchmark films that set the stage for Hollywood movies then onward, even though they weren't films driven by special effects. Cinema is an evolving art form and it's bound to repeat some things. Is that really a bad thing especially when the film in question is only a 'soft-reboot' and not a shot-by-shot remake of the original? I say no: it isn't. The Force Awakens is a blockbuster that's derivative but progressive, familiar but fresh. It's not perfect but it's Star Wars through and through.Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens was finally released in 2015 to audience, critical and commercial fanfare: it was named one of the AFI's Top 10 Films of 2015, grossed $U.S.2.07 billion at the global box office and was credited with revitalizing the Star Wars franchise. However, there were some ardent fans who criticized the film for its redundancies they wished weren't featured in the film, and I can understand those criticisms; I just don't agree with those who hold those issues against the film. The Force Awakens is an overdue visit from an old friend that you've been wanting to see again for years. And you find that the friend has made some notable changes since the last time you saw him. You see what was there before but you can also feel and embrace the new stuff as well; and that's very true for the story of The Force Awakens.The Force Awakens is a blast to watch: it's intergalactic fun that honors the previous movies beautifully and manages to feel new while strictly being a self-aware Star Wars romanticist's film made for people who grew up on The Original Trilogy.The Force Awakens gets 5/5 stars."
" Not Good
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,4,"Yes, Disney hired a perennial remaker to remake the original once more, but then none of the actors were very good either. I am not sure whether the director failed (in this respect too) or the casting crew were working on a tight budget."
" My little boy said it was the best film he'd ever seen , and was so excited isn't that the point ?
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,8,"Ok yes , it follows the first film in plot , but you've got to admit it's a good solid film .
I loved Star Wars as a kid , and didn't care for the prequels , you had good actors with wooden lines and far too much cgi that takes away too much from the films .
My little boy loved it ,surely that's the point that everyone's missing.
It hasn't ruined my childhood to be honest it's the closest thing to the original films I've seen in a long time .
Time to grow up people let the next generation have their say , and for me I loved it ,shame about last jedi .
Fingers crossed for the next one, jj I hope the force is with you .
Ps please make my boy happy again"
" Well i hate star wars but this reboot is terrible
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,1,"I have never Been liked star wars, i never find some interesting, but this new One ir awfull, more reason to hate star wars."
" Worthless crap
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,3,"The Force Awakens is unoriginal, superficial and dull. The characters have none of the life or independence of those in the original trilogy. They just pant and stare at each-other with intense emotions. I'm not surprised J. J. Abrams scolded Daisy Ridley for being too wooden because he seems to like overacting rather than natural performances.The plot is ripped off mainly from A New Hope but also episodes V and VI. Jakku is a desert planet just like Tatooine. The Starkiller (a reference to Luke's original surname before it was changed to Skywalker) is just a big Death Star. Even in the opening titles I became suspicious with references to the First Order (basically the Empire) and the Resistance (basically the Rebellion). Apparently nothing has changed since Return of the Jedi. Some plans are hidden in a droid. They need to deactivate the shields before they can do anything. The vehicles include the Millenium Falcon, Tie fighters and X-wings. One part is a direct imitation of the dogfight in Star Wars. Heavy sigh.Kylo Ren is one of the lamest villains in movie history. He's an admitted imitation of Darth Vader. He wears a mask for no apparent reason. He casually takes it off at some point and reveals that he looks like a pouty teenager. He has no presence and isn't intimidating at all. The fact that he throws tantrums is a weakness, not a strength. It's a bad sign if I feel like I could easily beat a movie's main villain in a fight. Also, he's not conflicted. Near the start, he says ""kill them, kill them all"" in reference to innocent civilians. That's evil.Finn is a dumb idea for a character. A storm trooper with a change of heart? What did he think he was getting into? And how can we continue to see other storm troopers as generic henchmen if we've now seen that some of them might be nice guys? There's no consistency. He's dull and only adds some mild comic relief.Rey is a Mary Sue. She learns the ways of the force independently in no time at all. She makes Luke look like a moron. But more to the point, her character shows that Abrams and the writers don't understand Star Wars. Having Rey learn so quickly cheapens the force and the whole process of learning about it.Captain Phasma is a throwaway bad guy. She's tall. She has about two lines. That's it. General Hux shouts until he froths at the mouth. Another sign of weakness. Tarkin was much more interesting in episode IV.Harrison Ford is good, but wasted. One terrible scene involves him and others fighting some fake-looking CGI creatures. For whatever reasons, he broke up with Leia after they had a kid (her acting was pretty mediocre I thought, may she rest in peace). This isn't fleshed out. And he gets killed too easily. He's not that stupid. And we have nothing invested in his relationship with Kylo.Abrams' direction is flat. Everything is shot in medium close-up. Most shots are focused on a character's face, heavy with overwrought emotion. There are few establishing shots and they are underwhelming. There's no sense of wonder, no mystery. Nothing that compares with Luke looking at binary Suns as the Force theme swells.John Williams is amazing but this score is forgettable and somewhat empty. I suspect he was not as inspired as usual by the material. And perhaps the pace of the movie didn't leave enough room for the music to breathe, to develop. Kylo Ren has a 4-note motif. Rey's theme is weak as well. There's nothing that compares to the rich, brilliant, powerful scores of the original 6 films.The ending is a joke. A slap in the face to fans of Star Wars but also movies in general. It's a cliffhanger at a literal cliff. The camera swirls around, blurring the background. Mark Hamill turns to look at the camera. How profound. But the real problem is that by this point - I simply don't care."
" Like seeing an old friend, Star Wars is back on the big screen where it belongs.
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,9,"Although this film has a LOT of throwbacks to the original trilogy in its settings, scenes and characters, they all work well together and make a solid story, complimented by the great acting from lesser known stars. Great action scenes and special effects, and the story sets up enough promise to be interesting in the next film."
" I don't get it
",2018-10-10 00:00:00,2,"This film has nothing. It is empty. Did it really and truly cost 200 million to make? Or is it just hearsay?
The story was cloned from 1977, the chick was ugly and the gender switch was standard. Jeez man if you want me to come back to the theater get a cute chick next time. Over and out muthas"
" Just another Sci-fi movie
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,1,"When i first saw this movie, everyone around me liked it and i thought that the world gone mad. But after The Last Jedi i understood that some people just like Harrison Ford and don't care about the actual movie. Some people just like cool effects and Sci-FI movies in general. Some people like Star Wars so much that they are blind to all logic because they already decided that move was flawless before they even saw it. Thats why im so happy that Rian Johnson messed up The Last Jedi so hard that people kind of woke up from their coma and realized that both of this movies are so stupid, so poorly written and so not Star Wars. These movies have so many plotholes that it's impossible to save. Just drop this trilogy and make a new one when you know what your customers want."
" Someone stop Disney please
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,2,"Someone stop Star Wars. PLEASE!! The sooner someone stops this rubbish from making films the better. If we get rid of the studio, we get rid of Jar Jar Abrams as well. Now isn't that the kind of world we're all striving to live in?!"
" The first NOT Star Wars of the ""new era""
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,1,"Almost 3 years ago.... seems like yesterday when I was watching the trailers and thinking... ""that looks good... is it possible that Disney gets this right?"" WRONG! Little did I realise what a hack and copycat JJ Abrams is, what a PC full of arrogance and BS corporation Disney is.... I was of course worried when I roamed the Disney stores and I saw Chewie dolls and cute stormtroopers. Yet they displayed constantly the trailers and they kept on increasing my hype and I found myself thinking ""this could be REALLY good!""There I went, Christmas time, cheer, take my child to the cinema. I admit I had a good time... then I started reflecting on what I just saw, I kept on reflecting on how the ""big spoiler"" I read had raised a massive warning flag on my brain. But I didn't mind too much about it... but then I returned home and I started making sense of what I just saw.A complete reboot of the saga... ALL old characters disrespected, including DARTH VADER(!!) and even Chewie, R2D2 and C3PO! . Plot holes galore. New characters totally nonsensic, unappealing, badly acted (OMG): Finn, not making sense at all, comical side kick.... Rey! overpowered nonsensic Mary Sue... Kylo! Vader wannabe, no sense at all.... Snoke: Emperor 2.0, out of nowhere!.... what a hot mess!
Then the ""story""... scene by scene copies of the Original Trilogy, only not making any sense this time... Death Star 3.0 (really????) deus ex machina everywhere, a totally lame climax, silly death scene included.My little one was completely bored, that should tell you something. When I was the same age I went to see Star Wars.... the original one. That was an event that changed my life, I don't see the same effect in my little one. BIG time fail Disney, you screwed up a great saga big time.So... let's give one star for BB8 ""cuteness""... if anything."
" A Plea to Disney
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,2,"If you are going to extend the gender switch trend and fad to Star Wars at least make the said Mary Sue wear something skimpy so we can enjoy her body. For heaven's sake she is a bad actor, she has no expressions and everything falls in her lap, she gives the middle finger to the force, the teachings of yoda and does not need the Jedi academy... and she is not attractive or pretty??? Hell, if she is not cute and cannot show off then I cannot give anymore money to you guys."
" It's STAR WARS, jerks!!
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie was tremendous. After the first 40 minutes, I was glued to my seat, mainly because the theater staff did a bad job cleaning up after the previous screening. But still, I found myself totally engrossed in this adventure before realizing what was ahead... the original cast!! For the first time in over 30 years, I was actually able to be reunited with the set of iconic characters who'd been such a huge part of my young life. I don't care if this story was in some ways a rehash of the original Star Wars. After years of being mired in prequel hell, it was just so great to watch the characters I could root for again. And the new characters are interesting, funny, and charming as well. Besides, if you're gonna rehash any movie, Star Wars is a great pick!!
So what the hell is everybody's problem??
What exactly would satisfy all of you??
You all seem to claim to be big Star Wars fans, yet you've s**t on every episode since Empire!! How can you really consider yourselves ""fans"" of Star Wars if you only like 2 movies out of 10? I mean, is it possible that all of your opinions are completely backwards? Maybe Star Wars is just as great as it's always been, and YOU are the ones who suck."
" The Force Kind Of Awakens
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,7,"The hype of this movie was nearly out of this world. Not as fever pitch as it was for The Phantom Menace, but it was close.The first Star Wars movie to feature the big three since the 80's. The big three being Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.I knew beforehand that Disney wiped the old Expanded Universe material of the novels and comics from the 90's up until 2012. It was sad, but expected somewhat. So I was curious as to how they would approach the film.The end result? It was ok. Not the best movie it should have/could have been. But it was ok. Good even. It was great seeing our familiar faces from the past. Harrison Ford still had the old Han Solo charm and humour. Carrie Fisher was at home again as Leia. She should have come into the movie a bit earlier. And Mark Hamill (though his appearance was extremely brief) brought out the inner child in me screaming in joy.The new characters were good. Daisy Ridley was great as Rey. They could have explained her characters background a little bit more. That would have avoided the countless millions of questions of who she really is and how did she did the things she did quickly. This doesn't even get explained in the following film. So hopefully in Episode 9 we all will know more. Finn honestly wasn't the best character in the film. Once he and Daisy meet his role is reduced a fair bit. Poe Dameron was great. I was glad to see his character get more screen time in The Last Jedi. I didn't expect to like BB8 but he was a funny and quirky little droid. Kylo Ren was the standout character of the movie and to who he is in relation to our beloved older characters as well.The movie was good and it set the board for more Star Wars movies for the future. It just could have been better"

",2018-09-15 00:00:00,3,"I've been reading star wars books forever, there are about 165 books out with a timeline out to 45 years past a New Hope. Great stories. In them Han Solo and Leila have 3 kids, two are twins all with the force. Luke married and had a son named Ben. Why didn't they use any of those great stories. Never was there a First Order or a leader Snopes mentioned in any of them. Yea one of Han's son turned to the dark side and became a Sith Lord but was killed by his twin sister. Disney totaled ignored the Star Wars universe and just made this story out of the air. So much material to work with and they use basically a repeat of a New Hope with different characters. Movie was ok but very disappointed."
" 10 years felt like so long!

So many have ragged on the sequel trilogy thus far and starting with the first, I WILL be defending it! Episode VII is a great film; a excellent part of the Star Wars franchise! It introduced us to great, new characters and brought back our well-known old ones. The storytelling on display here is fantastic, Kylo Ren is superb villain, played tremendously by Adam Driver and the mystery of Daisy Ridley's Rey is extremely interesting to me and I can't wait to see how her story wraps up. John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are also great here in their respected roles as Finn and Poe. Harrison Ford coming back as Han Solo is just the icing on the cake! I get so tired of hearing people complaining about the last few episodes in the Skywalker story! We wanted good, new Star Wars and we got it! Stop complaining and may the Force be with you...always."
" Not an 8.0
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,5,This is merely due to the fact this movie rides on the sentimental value of real fans. Without that it has done nothing new*death star 3.0 anyone?* Main character is the literal dictionary definition of a mary sue and has no character developement. Fin is next he has a little bit of developement but its uncovincing and boyega im sorry to say didnt do very well acting this role*neither did daisy tbh*. Its just the hole thing thing feels like its some fan made movie which can be good but never great. Id maybe put this above the prequels but thats merely for the special affects. I personally like the story line of the prequels much more than this. Also Star wars the clone wars is coming back!!! Dave Filoni is director!!! Seriously this is the last thread on the rope keeping star wars from falling to a firery.
" I thought it was bad at first...
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,1,"At first, I thought this was the worst movie ever. Of all time. And then I finally got around to watching the Last Jedi. Which makes this one actually seem okay in comparison. It's still the second worst movie I have ever seen. Why is it so bad? It takes everything you love about Star Wars and cheapens it. Also, I can't help compare it to the original EU storyline set in the same time frame. On top of actually making sense, the Legacy of the Force series has one of the most fantastic villains ever devised. Despite this film's main villain having a certain connection to that villain, the main villain of the Force Awakens is a cheap knockoff, reminiscent of everything I hated about Anakin Skywalker in Attack of the Clones, only without the good stuff. We introduce a lot of new characters, but the only one I remotely care about is the new droid that, as he should, hero worships R2-D2. In short, only watch this if you want to destroy your childhood. As for its sequel, that will tear apart whatever remaining shreds of it you have left."
" A bad movie with a lot of budget
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,4,"Big budget couldnt save this, its bad.
Is the first and only Star Wars movie I saw so far for which I was constantly checking how much time is left."
" Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens Review
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,8,"Abrams had the benefit of learning what didn't work in Lucas' prequels, and he's gone in the opposite direction. He's also set an interesting course for moving forward with this engaging cast playing new characters making their way through this beloved universe."
" Perfect....
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,10,"JJ Abrahams has directed a fine Star Wars movie with numerous hidden references and Easter eggs which are pretty mind blowing once they are found out. Many fans keep complaining how the plot is similar to ""A New Hope"". However, a saga prominent as this one must recapture what was observed more than 3 decades ago to show obvious relevance to the past."
" Slightly better than Last Jedi
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,2,Just slightly. I mean just a hair above the pure garbage that was The Last Jedi. So it's got that going for it
" The cast is excellent, however J.J.Abrams shouldn't have borrowed most of the plot from A New Hope, he should have done an original story instead. All tease and no explain
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,1,"As a longtime Star Wars fan, I feel this one is a bad movie and ties for the weakest in the whole franchise with Rise of Skywalker, which coincidentally was also directed and written by JJ Abrams. The 2 positive that I can say, are that the cast is excellent (both new and old). The VFX are excellent too, and those 2 things are the only positives I can give.Star Wars like The Lord of the Rings, has some of a biblical quality, in therms of being a blockbuster, and but JJ Abrams completely missunderstands the franchise, and treats it more like a brainless blockbuster. And that doesn't work at all.The main problem is J.J.Abrams shouldn't have borrowed most of the plot from A New Hope, he should have done an original story instead. You get Jakuu a Dessert Planet like Tattoine, in everything but name a Death Star but whithout the backstory or mithology behind A New Hope's Death Star, which was so huge that inspired Rogue One.All tease and no explain, it feels like an unnecesary prologue and retread of the original film. They should have started with the original story and just skipped all this. As someone who got into the previous films, and the animeted The Clone Wars and Rebels, before this, after seeing weekly a new story, to jump into the the film expecting a new story, to instead get a rethread, felt totally creativity.Next year's Rogue One, where peolpe died to get the Death Star plans, just makes J.J.Abrams rushed plan to Starkiller base, which was destroyed without anyone getting any plans, in a completely rushed attack, seem even more lazy, in that here they just explode it. Also it necesary to highlight that this film includes Captain Phasma, who easilly is the worst and most poorly written character in all the film franchise, due to renouncing to her ideals at the mere sight of a gun pointed to her head.However, the robots, aliens, ships, sets, the props creativity is there, and J.J. Abrams wasted everybody's talent in telling a story that had already been told, and better than Lucas. To give this film a fresh rating would be to endorse laziness and to endorse other sequels, to copy/paste the previous best moments of the previous best films of their franchise. The cast deserves all the more praise for doing magic, out of very very thin air.Rian Johnson did turned The Force Awakens characters, into separate persons from their original trilogy , and gives answers, were J.J. Abrams gave teases, motivations instead of misteries, that;s why ian Johnson gets a fresh rating where J.J. Abrams doesnt. The five star are entirelly for the cast, the five absent star are for J.J. Abrams, lazy story-telling. Some Lawrence Kasdan's touches here and there, and the cast does magic from nothing, but are not enough to save the film from the derivative story.It deeply saddens me to give this film a low rating, specially since I'm a big Star Wars fan, and since in a crazy real-life story, the main lead of this film used her social media, to try to get me a date for this film.Still, 100% worth a watch, if anything out of the curiosity of it including the original cast members (like the Holiday Special). And because the new cast is excellent, but this film is a pretty bad movie, with good acting and VFX. Honestly the only decent reason to watch this, is because the sequel called The Last Jedi, is actually pretty good and against all odds redeems this film, with its interpretation of it, directed and written by Rian Johnson is the only good of the Sequel Trilogy movies.The Force Awakens is a filler episode that is a remake of a better Episode, and it doesn't progress the plot at all. Kids now can stream the whole Saga in a week, they aren't idiots this movie considers them to be. Without a a shadow of doubt, they will notice all of JJ Abrams plagiarisms and they won't be pleased by them. Maybe it fooled critics on the release time, but in the long run, as Han Solo said ""they always find the truth"", and this film ""isn't how The Force works""."
" Horrible and unoriginal
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,1,Go watch A New Hope instead it's basically the same movie.
" Amazing film! Lived up to the hype!
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,9,"Star Wars the force awakens is probably the most anticipated film of all time. And it was amazing! A lot of people criticize the force awakens for being a retread of a new hope. But that doesn't mean it's a bad film all Star Wars movies are similar to each other. The new characters in this film are great. And I loved the return of Han, Leia, and Luke. Even though Luke was there for only 10 seconds. The movie also had a cool villain, Kylo Ren. He's a conflicted villain with an awesome character arc. The scene where he kills Han Solo was pretty emotional too. So the force awakens is a great film and it revived the franchise."
" More Enjoyable To Watch Than The Last Jedi
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,9,"When Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens opened in cinemas in December 2015, I thought that this was beginning of another great trilogy set of movies.JJ Abrams has never failed to deliver a brilliant movie, look at his movie CV which started off with Mission: Impossible III, Star Trek, Super 8 and Star Trek: Into Darkness, it was only logical (pardon the pun) that a director like JJ should direct The Force Awakens and he didn't fail at all, I loved The Force Awakens but I don't think Han should have been killed off as it would have been great to see Luke, Han and Leia all on the same screen.The new characters pretty much held their own as well and I was impressed with Rey, Cameron Poe and Finn and overall, I definitely think that The Force Awakens deserve it's nine star rating that I have given it.I just wish I could have had nicer things to say about the Last Jedi which slipped down in the ratings and I berated Rian Johnson for his terrible script and direction...Lucasfilm definitely need to do more checking on future film directors and not let someone who has only directed a student movie and a feature film movie (Looper - 2012) come in and almost totally destroy the Star Wars franchise.I just that JJ can work his magic again and save Episode IX, I have heard that time travel is one of the possible plotlines where the Millenium Falcon goes back in time but we will all have to wait and see what happens when Episode IX arrives at the cinemas in December 2019."
" It's cool!
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,8,"It's not a bad film despite the incredible similarity to A New Hope. That ws annoying because they rehashed the whole Death Star plot with Starkiller base. I was waiting for the villain to be some hot guy like Hayden Christiansen, then I saw Adam Driver. Disappointed! Daisy Ridley did a excellent job and of course Harrison Ford did too. That's one of the reasons why this is rated so highly. Another desert planet just like Tatooine, with a main character who doesn't know her parents, she meets a droid and the whole plot is repeated. That being said I do not think it was a bad movie but it could've been different."
" The Prodigal Son Come Home at Last
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,8,"This movie is flawed, to say the least. Most of the main characters are played by novice actors, and it shows, the acting alternating between some genuinely impactful drama and lighthearted action, and cringe-inducingly misfired attempts at likewise. The script likewise alternates between bland, dry, filler, and clunky, overwrought lines where the writers were obviously trying too hard, and precious few scenes in the goldilocks zone where the script flows organically.The plot is likewise a mixed bag. On one hand, the overall plotline is somewhere between an homage and a bold-faced rip off of A New Hope- I'm looking at you, giant impractical superweapon mk3. ON the other hand, some of the character scenes do manage to rise above the issues of script and acting, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren in particular manages to portray a genuinely conflicted villain, and the scenes he shares with Rey are where their potential as actors shines through the morass. Of course, none of this justifies the ending, or rather lack thereof. I suspect that the printer jammed with only one page still to go, and the Abrams just shrugged and decided to roll with it.The technical elements of the film fare moderately better. With the original trilogy (4-6) using mostly practical effects, and the prequels using mostly CG, this film used an interesting mix, with most of the costumes and aliens being practical, the space scenes being high quality digital, and the large planet bount fight scenes being an almost (But not quite) seamless mix of the two. Abrams has become somewhat of the punching bag among hollywood pundits in recent years (though not quite to Michael Bay levels, may the force keep him far away from these sequels), but the direction of the film, such as the usage of camera angles, positioning, and the way the scenes transition and make a mostly-coherent whole out of the intermittent tone and quality beliai a fair amount of genuine talent on his part.So, why, despite my criticism, did I give it a 8/10? Consider the prequels.To call the prequel trilogy (1-3) a trainwreck is charitable. Sewer explosion would be more accurate. The acting straddled between wooden and middle-school level (you know, when the 14 year olds are just competent enough to begin vastly overestimating their thespian prowess), the script was clunky and overblown at the same time, the effects were dated within a year of their release and have only gotten worse over the years, and many characters and scenes were transparent attempts to move merchandise. But the greatest sin of all of the legion thereof they committed was simply this: They did not feel like Star Wars. The plots focus on political intrigue, in addition to being poorly done, were simply diametrically opposed to the tone of the original trilogy. Lovable characters, simple without being thinly characterized, having fun and interesting adventures through a vast universe in a backdrop of more serious war and galactic turmoil.That is where the Prequels failed utterly, and this is where Force Awakens has its greatest and most unambiguous success: It FEELS like a Star Wars movies.Nostalgia has clouded our judgement somewhat, but all of the problems and shortcomings of Force Awakens- wooden acting, clunky writing, and a plot that tended towards the cliche and absurd- were present, to varying extents, in A New Hope, not ironed out until its sequels. But the tone, the style, the limitless promise and potential of the concepts and universe, shined through then, and, after being lost for three films, has finally returned in full force. It is this quality, a sense of adventure and wonder, that is the true mark of a good Star Wars film, and it is this quality that raises The FOrce Awakens to a worthy successor to the Original trilogy, and it is this resounding success that makes its myriad, though neither egregious nor unprecedented, flaws forgivable.After the misfiring train-wreck of the prequels, I have confidence that the Star Wars franchise is in competent hands once again. If you have the time, a modest recommendation for Star Wars: The Force Awakens."
" What have they done to Star Wars?
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,3,"Okay, before I start my rant I am just going to mention this is the seventh movie of the franchise if you watching in chronological order.So this movie is about a women who is roaming around on the planet called Jakku and we have no idea other then her name who she is? where did she come from? And whatever happened to her parents? The character is just not interesting whatsoever, she is just a Mary Sue version of Star Wars. She doesn't seem to care at all.Kylo Renn is a massive joke his face makes me puke he looks like professor snapes son. He looks more like a bully that is about to take a kids lunch money or play with someone's glasses. Also how did him and Snoke come to power. Apart from the CGI and special effects everything else about this movie is terrible. I am sorry but I don't think Disney can make a good Star Wars movie at all they more or less care about money and their political beliefs then the franchise.Also JJ Abrams, Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kenandy messed this up so badly that they ruin the whole franchise.Majority of it was just boring. If you want to watch the movie more power to you but if you really love the franchise you will be very disappointed.It does make me wonder how did this movie get an 8/10. I wonder if Disney are forcing all of the cast and crew who worked on this movie to give it a 10.Have a good day everyone and may the force be with you."
" A review that nobody will read because it's completely irrelevant now.
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,8,"I was a little hesitant to write this review. After all, it's not as if I'd be likely to say anything that hasn't already been said. I suppose I might be able to contribute something by commenting on Force Awakens in a post- Last Jedi context. I didn't think that this deserved all of the praise that it initially got. It was all of what we like about Star Wars in moderate amounts, but nothing spectacular. The Force was used almost shamelessly as a plot device here, which is at least one thing I think you can say that the Last Jedi did better since the Force is actually a point of conflict and debate. Overall, I would summarize it with this: Force Awakens didn't do anything especially wrong, but didn't have anything exceptionally good about it, while Last Jedi had some major flaws alongside some of the most amazing moments in any Star Wars movie.I'm trying to think of more things to say about this movie that won't sound totally redundant. I'm excited to dish out ten bucks to see Episode 9, but not for the anthologies. All things considered, Force Awakens did what it needed to and ensured that this generation of kids will also be obsessed with Star Wars. Overall Rating: 7.8/10"
" Great new start, brought out the worst in many fans.
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,10,"This movie was fun. From beginning to end, it was a good way to jump start the star wars franchise. While I'm not a JJ Abrams fan at all, and can't stand his Star Trek movies, I also don't like his habit of let's do it because it's cool and never explain a thing, this was a fun movie. The new characters are tremendous and the only complaint I have is that it really brought out the worst in Star Wars fans. There's no such thing as black stormtroopers! How the hell does anyone know that? (I would have liked to know why they stopped using clones). Why a female jedi hero? Why the hell not? Just sit back and enjoy the movie or shut up."
" What I think.
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,7,"Seeing that I'm more of a Harry Potter fan, after seeing this movie, I feel drawn to it, the actors (new actors) that were chosen were perfect, and I especially love Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver (Rey & Kylo).
This movie was rather interesting graphically, and certain scenes would leave me on the edge of my seat. It's rather riveting."
" It took a long time for me to accept it, but this is a remake
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,6,"I have defended this title against all the possible critics it has. I have tried to justify director's choices and the validity of the plot. But what's on screen can't be denied. This movie is a remake. I find the attempt to remake a movie so revered as 'Star Wars' a disloyalty to its legacy. Homages can be made in other media, but if you have the responsibility of extend a story that millions of people love, you have to do your best to create new elements, in one direction or another, but the worst thing you can do is to repeat what has been done, and what is considered to be unbeatable. I find in that an excess of pride or a lack of courage, or at least a terrible mistake, but repeating a movie is not a tribute. I found the first paralelism before the first scene ended. The plot copies are so many that they exceed the reference to become a mistake. Specially, I find the 'copy climax' in everything involving the new Death Star, but you can choose: main character's mysterious parentage, rebels in a hidden base, cantina, old mentor who lived the events of the past, etc.And I feel so sorry for saying that, but the most hyped movie of history is far away from the expected level. I won't join that hate wave that has grown through fans, because the movie has its positive elements. I find interesting the new ones. Kylo Ren is a good idea of villain, because, as J J Abrams said himself, you can't do anything better than Darth Vader. Also the character of Rey finds her own pace with a skilled and hard cover, but with a vulnerable heart. That idea of main characters who have grown up influenced by myths of the past suppose a resemblance with the viewer. Also Finn and his noble decisions are interesting elements. Finally, the lightsaber battle in a dark forest is a very good environment never seen.But stop counting new elements there. And I won't speak about other details and problems, because I have argued about all of them for a long time. The movie has its own excuses to explain why Rey won the duel. The fail is greater than that. Why everything managed in 'Return of the jedi' is now destroyed, just to start from the same point, in a sand planet, with a plan in a droid....? We expected other things in Ep. VII. A Luke settled as a Jedi Master, a Leia leader of the New Republic, a new jedi order with new characters, two or three children of Han and Leia. What a wasted opportunity...To mention it, because I find it fair, it's so good to see Star Wars back to the top of VFX effects, John Williams back to his saga, and one of the best cinema moments I had in this decade: watch the Star Wars title over the stars again in the big screen.I find my 6/10 in those details and the fact that this can be an interesting title to those people who have never seen Star Wars. Because this is not a bad movie, is a bad Episode VII."
" I won't bother to rehash
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,2,"To start off, I submitted my rating of 2/10 and then IMDB asked me to sign in. I did, and when it popped up again, I had somehow magically rated it an 8. That explains how this awful, hokey and utterly contrived POS got such a high rating. In a nutshell, I felt like I was watching a parody of a Star Wars movie. The only thing I've seen lately that was remotely close to the three great original films has been Rogue One. Don't waste your time or money watching this USA Network slapdash hunk of saccharin, watch Rogue One instead. J.J. Abrams is now officially the ruination of cherished memories."
" Money Milking at its best
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,4,"Not sure how something like this gets such good ratings. As a Movie in and of it self its not too bad (but also far from good). As a Star Wars Movie its just crap. It is unoriginal, full of tired missplaced and unnatural characters."
" Mediocrity buttressed by nostalgia.
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,4,"Recently I came to the realization that my biggest problem with this film, which increases every time I rewatch it, is that without its connections to Star Wars as a franchise this film would be just another forgettable family-friendly action/adventure popcorn film that very few people would care about after the first 24 hours of leaving the cinema. It offers nothing more than loud sounds, flashy graphics, easily consumable characters, a plot that reeks of laziness and the Disney stamp of approval beside a film tag that might as well say ""Hey! Remember Star Wars? Us too!""Hell, even Maz Kanata looks like a Pixar character. This film ages like bread, not wine."
" Could've been better
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,1,"Chewbacca and Han is awesome Rey not as awesome 
They should remake the movie and the giant Death Star as a plant that's just stupid and like episode four"
" A great comeback of Star Wars!
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,8,In my opinion the best parts of this were the character Rey and the great participation of Harrison Ford as Han Solo. I liked very much the part where Solo says the Force is real with the Jedi and the Sith!
" Thanks Guys
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,2,"Now that Di$ney and Jar Jar Abrams made a billion on this the lesson they learned is that copying older films is the way to go. How many more remakes do you think Di4ney will push now?? A hundred, two hundred? A million?
Di$ney was already the master of money stealing, sucker trapping remakes with all the Hunchbacks and Robin Hoods they have released. Now that this remake worked JJ Abrams will be hired to hide another ten plans in ten robots and introduce so many death stars with the exact same flaw!!! 
PS: Next time get a hot girl in a microskirt. At least, that is something to look forward to if we have to put up with the gender switch"
" As great as the earliest in the series
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,8,"In part seven of the universally famous series, outer space continues to have more battles between good and evil forces. Some of the characters of the well-known middle trilogy are present (thirty years older) with some newer and younger characters as well.The galaxy is busy once again with various battles and subplots. Like other films, ""The Force Awakens"" can occasionally overwhelm with sci-fi jargon but only to a point. The main story and battles are easy for average viewers to understand and, most of all, to enjoy.The technical aspects of the film are, as expected, the grandest elements especially the visual effects. The production set designs are to die for as well. There are more than a few great moments of aerial shots that show how small the people appear within the great sets that surround them.As the middle trilogy (1977 - 1983) is so familiar, it felt movingly sentimental to see the great likes of Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill reprising their renowned roles of Han Solo, Princess (now General) Leia, and Luke Skywalker respectively as well as the characters Chewbacca, C3PO, and R2D2.There is a shocking conflict scene near the end that recalls a similar scene in ""The Empire Strikes Back"". And the brilliant final scene is surely Hollywood spectacle at its very best - goosebumps and all.Director J.J. Abrams has made a great contribution to this series. May the glorious force be with us again and again.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS: Production Design and Visual Effects"
" Not good.
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,3,Honestly very glad that I didn't go see it in theaters. It's kind of like someone tried to make a B movie version of Star Wars. Also they made the force powers really different and kindve lame.
" A remake, not a reboot
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,3,"The Force Awakens is by far the worst Star Wars movie, in my opinion, because it has zero originality. It is almost literally a scene-by-scene remake of A New Hope. If they had made that clear, maybe I wouldn't hate it, but trying to present it as a new story is just a joke.It's almost like they went down a checklist. Orphan on a desert planet? Check. Evil empire massacres people while searching for secret plans? Check. Escape from planet-destroying superweapon? Oedipal conflict? Ragtag band of underdog rebels? Check. The only differences are a more diverse cast and updated (but somehow less striking and impressive) visual effects.The only reason I don't give it a 1 is because the casting and acting are pretty good and it sets up The Last Jedi, which is actually worth seeing. On the other hand, I almost passed on watching it because this was so bad that I was sure Disney could not make a good Star Wars movie."
" Hind sight is not good for this movie...
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,6,"I just finished watching TFA and TLJ for the second time. While I left the rating for TFA the same (8/10), Once you see TLJ you won't be able to go back and watch TFA in the same way. Much of the plot, excitement and high points have the wind knocked out of them in TLJ so it just made me mad and disappointed at the lack of continuity."
" Rise of a new war
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,8,"A new beginning and a new fight as after Vader's place is taken by Kylo Ren (son of Leia and Han) and a new supreme leader emerges. A new hope emerges in the name of Rey who through a series of unexpected events gets in touch with the resistance. On a similar note on the other side, Finn helps Poe escape and finishes his job of transmitting the information about Luke's location to the resistance.
The story had little continuity from the earlier part and a new struggle has emerged as the First Order under Kylo has gained strength.
The chemistry of Rey and Finn is also interesting. R2-D2 has become recessive after departure of Luke...a saddie moment.
Poe's heroism as a brilliant pilot is worth watching. An emotional moment was the encounter of Han and Kylo wherein Kylo kills his father. Thereafter, the fight sequence of Kylo and Rey had nice action scenes. Overall, a good entertainer."
" Not a star wars fan, used to watch as a kid but now, never again.
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,2,"The acting was questionable.
The story is a repeat, only faster.
The same thing over again.
Seems a little feminist at times.
40 year old transition effects.IMDB seems rigged too, all the highest rated reviews are 1-2 stars, and yet its got an 8 star rating.Goodbye Star Wars, your magic and bad plots won be missed."
" How to Sell a Film with its Name
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,1,"Bare in mind this is coming from someone who was really never much of a Star Wars fan and has found at least 2/3 of films in the series extremely ""meh"", but I thought 90% of this film was a completely unnecessary and uninspired retread of previous Star Wars material. The plot is an extremely eye-rolling carbon copy of the original 1977 film whilst 90% of the characters are completely cardboard and uninteresting. There was potential mind you, but Rey is the epitome of a Mary Sue and Poe, Finn, and whatever other characters there were, were completely forgettable. The one exception to this is Kylo Ren, who is an admittedly interesting character but he isn't given enough to do. There are only maybe two scenes in the entire film that I found remotely entertaining, and those are the last scene involving Han along with maybe the lightsaber duel near the end. But beyond that, it is a horribly bland film. It's still well-made and well-shot, but at its core, it's mostly hollow. The only reason it got positive reception and made the amount of money it did was because of the Star Wars name and nothing more. If this film had a different title, its Rotten Tomatoes score would be in the 30's.Normally I'd rate this more like a 3/10, but given that the general IMDb consensus is surprisingly an 8/10. all it's getting for now is a 1/10."
" Enjoy

" Not Canon.
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,4,"Here is the core of what is wrong with this movie: everything that had been accomplished in the first 6 movies, everything the rebels and Jedi fought for, everything I had emotionally invested in for over 38 years, was scrapped in 30 seconds when Starkiller Base destroyed the Republic. Now we and the good guys are right back where we started in 1977. It is as if Disney and Abrams pushed a giant reset button. I expected this episode to start from and build upon the Rebels' success in Return of the Jedi, as did the Timothy Zahn books. I expected to see the Republic flourishing and the Jedi returned to glory led triumphantly by Luke Skywalker. This episode should have moved the story forward, but instead it boots it back to zero. For shame.For all that I would rate this a zero, but I will give it a 4 simply because for what it is, it was well made. At first I loved this movie, mostly because of the thrill of watching ""a new Star Wars movie"" in the theater again. The dialogue was better than the prequels, and the visuals and action were exciting. It was a homecoming to see Luke, Leia, and Han on the screen again. At first I thought I was ok with the obvious homages to Episode 4. But then the next day the reality settled in that the Star Wars universe that I grew up with had been stolen from me. I will watch all the rest of the movies and side movies because hey it's Star Wars, but we are on an alternate reality now. Emotionally I am out. This is not what Lucas intended."
" A new beginning
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,8,"The heroic cosmo-opera ""Star Wars"" ended with the third episode ""Revenge of the Sith"" in the distant 2005th year, later books and serials opened deeper into the universe, using plots of the expanded canon that shed light on clonic wars and some heroes like Darth Maul, the best villain franchise - Darth Vader. Six episodes of the saga, for all its difference in influence on the viewer and the fans together made up an amazingly solid canvas. The classic adventures of old films and political epic and air battles began the twenty-first century. The new generation requires a new ""Star Wars"". But the merger of Lucas Films and Disney, together with the cancellation of canons, triggered a sharp narrowing of the universe, where the new heroes are creating a new story. The new trilogy wanted to see when it comes out completely, but knowing how they like to squeeze money out of milk cows, then nine episodes may not be limited, so did not begin to delay acquaintance.
The synopsis of the film can be briefly described as follows: Luke Skywalker went into voluntary exile and became a myth. But in a distant galaxy, a conflict is arising between the First Order, inheriting the traditions of the Empire, and the Resistance, led by former Princess Leia. She sends her best pilot to find the map, which will indicate where her brother disappeared. By chance, the card hits the attack aircraft Finn, who does not want to serve the First Order, and the scavenger Ray from the provincial planet Giacca. Find the last Jedi not only they dream, but also the powerful servant of the First Order of Kylo Ren ...
Studio Disney conducted a workshop campaign to promote the seventh episode of the ""Star Wars"". Around the film was created an incredible hype, and at the same time Jay Abrams and his comrades managed almost nothing to talk about the content of the upcoming film. It seems the last time such an atmosphere of mystery surrounding the plot of the fantastic film was before the release of the third ""Matrix"". And the Wachowski brothers were intrigued not for nothing - their picture was generous with surprises (successful or not very much discussed some other time).
Abrams, on the other hand, is inclined to foment intrigue where there is no need. So, he let the fog around the character of Benedict Cumberbatch in the second ""Star Trek"", although only the lazy did not know who it was. That's the mystery surrounding the story ""Awakening Force"" had no special meaning, because he does not present any special surprises. The director has repeatedly confessed his love for the original Star Wars trilogy and stressed that he was trying to reproduce the stylistics and spirit of the classic episodes of the saga. But in his desire to be equal to them Abrams did not confine himself to the video series - the plot is also built according to the patterns of the early ""Star Wars"". Something similar could be seen in the universe of the Jurassic Period, where the classic ""Park ..."" was also resurrected, but in the new high-tech scenery, repeating the classics of the ninety-third year, the film offered nothing fundamentally new. The same can be said about the ""Awakening of Power"": it successfully reproduces the atmosphere of old star wars, does not skimp on references and direct quotes, but there is not even a new history here. As it seems to me here the failures of the starting trilogy films, I want to immediately show all the most important, give the right keys, but do not disclose all the cards at once, otherwise the case will prove to be dying before the situation requires it.
Of all the new characters (Finn, Po Dameron, Ray) the latter is better uncovered and even then it is not completely, I think that the episode of the eighth will give a little more information and food for thought about its origin. Finn is also a good character, but could be worked out better, the blessing is kind: a stormtrooper who crossed over to the side of the Resistance, but the motives for desertion are not disclosed, there are no clear leaks to this. According to Dameron, too often loomed on the screen to make any judgments.
Actor's work pleased. The newcomers coped well. Joe Boega in the role of Finn looks good, there is in this stormtrooper a comical element. Daisy Ridley in the role of Ray coped with its task, in her fate I see similarities with Luke and Anakin, in the sense that both grew on desert planets. Giacca is somewhat similar to Tatooine, but the atmosphere there seems gloomier. In the role of Kylo Rena is Adam Driver, the one who I liked as the priest Garuho, whose moral appearance impressed me slightly more than the main character. Kylo Ren is an ambitious character with a great villainous potential, but ultimately it is the synthesis of Anakin Skywalker's rushing, not knowing what he needs. But his ancestor to the dark side was reduced to the Sith, the future Emperor. Somehow his motivation is somehow incomprehensible: he wants to match his ancestor, but in this episode it has not turned out so far.
Verdicting: By and large the film turned out to be quite good. Of the advantages worth noting the style of the original trilogy, spectacular video (in this movie has always succeeded), the acting is not for everyone, but by and large does not cause questions. But the film is worth watching. Wait and see! All good and pleasant viewing!"
" Good Re-Start
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,9,"Yes, there are similarities with other SW movies...but what else would the Empire do but build a new superweapon?The new characters introduced are very likable and it sets up a new story quite nicely for the rest of the sequel trilogy."
" May the force be with you !
",2018-05-28 00:00:00,9,One of the most anticipated movies in recent years The Force awakens is a great addition to the Star Wars cannon and a mighty film in its own right. JJ Abrabs has the force with him and he totally used it to its advantage
" Star Wars for a new generation?
",2018-05-26 00:00:00,4,"Often you'll hear that the reason so much we already knew and had seen in episodes IV, V and VI was rehashed is: But they're making these movies to draw in new fans from a younger generation.This to me does not fly, any of today's parents grew up on Star Wars I through VI and will have shown them to their kids at some point in time. Also Star Wars Rebels was on from 2014 to 2018, and Star Wars The Clone Wars ran from 2008 to 2014 so ever since only 3 years after the Release of Episode V Star Wars has been on tv CONTINOUSLY....! So who are you introducing to something new her? It's all been established, so just tell a new chapter in an ever unfolding story rather than retelling what we already know.I was already disappointed when Episode VI contained another similar space weapon as we saw in Episode IV, but to repeat that tired old thing once again in VII and defeating it in much the same way is unforgivable. (And no, Han remarking something like that in a meta sort of way does not redeem this fact).Snoke is so underwhelming and unexplained, it's all just based on JJ Abrams ""mystery box"" analogy. To him everything can be a macguffin and remain forever unexplained. I tend to disagree with me Abrams on this.All in all I was thoroughly disappointed and would not recommend."
" Dull
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,2,"Typical modern blockbuster, full of lame jokes, no surprises and invincible characters hurtling towards an ending that only services sequels. The original movies are fondly remembered, but there is nothing in this that will last. Who will remember any of this stuff?"

That's where all normal people who seen the movie give it an honest number based on howmuch they liked it.But when you start reading reviews, you will get the 'highly opinionated' folks that feel so strong they need to write something and among who, as logic demands, there's a lot of haters & complainers and people who get their opinions from other people's opinions. Kind of like youtube.About the movie I will be short: the number at the movies page is correct. All these reviewers here giving this movie a 1 star? So you say this movie is worse than Battlefield Earth and Exorcist VII? How can you expect anyone to take you serious then?

" The Fart Awoke Inside Disney
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,1,"As you can see by that title and the review, I despise what was done to TFA by Kennedy and J. J.. This movie is something we were so hyped to see, and tbh, at first I though it was good, until it struck me when I got out of the theater. I was disappointed, let down, and angry, and I still am after seeing TLJ. What is different about TFA compared to the Trilogy? NOTHING! A person is on a mission to recover plans to bring to a small band of rebels, but is ambushed by the enemy. The enemy sith Lordish dude is a person wearing black armor, wearing a mask, blah blah blah. Then it shows this person who goes to save the fugitive upon a ship of some sort. Then there is a person that has been separated from their parents on a desert planet, who doesn't know that they are force sensitive. They meet up with a droid or two, and saves the droid(s) that carries the plans, or the map to something very important. It goes on, and on, and on, with the same exact things as before. Rey is a MAry Sue, which basically ruins her character. Finn is ok, but needs some work. Poe is the Wedge and Solo combo. Ruined Han, by killing him like that. This whole movie was and is RUINED. JJ makes us think Luke ran away because he failed. Wouldn't he have rejoined with his family, to tell them what went wrong? Luke's character was ruined, because that is not Luke to just run away. We get no explanation of who some of these new people are. Literally nothing in this movie made me excited to say that ""This is a Star Wars movie"". Disappointing. I know there is so much more wrong with this movie, but I'm getting too lazy to complain about it, because people don't understand detail these days."
" Fun while it lasted
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"It was good, but I wasn't as thrilled as most people were. Visually, it was very well made and the action scenes were cool, but the pacing could've been faster. Star Wars is usually known for fast action scenes. The story was interesting and so were the twists. So it was a good time, nothing more."
" Disappointment would be an understatement

I don't care how much you liked Star Wars as a kid or whatever, these films don't have the slightest vibe you get from watching a Star Wars film. Absolutely terrible, I don't know how Disney wasted so much money producing such an awful movie. Do yourself a favor, save your time and money and pretend these movies don't exist and the series stops at episode 6 lol"
" False promises of the galactic kind
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,4,"Where does one even begin. JJ Abrams YOU sir may have been known for great tv such as ""Lost"" ""Revolution"" Fringe"" Alias"" and had your mind and hands behind decent films such as ""Cloverfield"" Super 8"" and a host of others. This franchise you should have kept your hands off of.JJ always wants to go bigger, do things greater, ALWAYS money behind his projects, which is a good thing don't get me wrong, but YOU have to want to put out the best possible product. All that this film is comes down to a complete re-do of the original Star Wars: A New Hope. Very similar plot, different time (yes) set some 30+ years later, BUT same damn story told. Instead of Vadar, we have KYLO-REN (Han/Leia)son where as it was Luke/Vadar (Anakin/Padme)son. The story compiles of a massive weapon such like the original Death Star, we have a BIGGER/badder death star in this film. Instead of a male lead we have a female lead in Rey, who we know nothing about really.There was absolutely no sync, no character development, no ambition behind the sequences. The acting/performances were absolutely horrendous, a well aged Leia that did nothing for the film. An interesting albeit already done face of between Han/Kylo-Ren which ends with a well expected result. All in all this is an abortion of the franchise. This would be a good film for a rainy Sunday morning with nothing to do but fill time."

" Dismal
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,3,"Force Awakens is dull, miserable and predictable. I really like JJ, but I can only assume he was emasculated by Disney, who, having paid a fortune for the Lucasfilm franchise wanted to make some of their investment back and thought the best way to do that was not to offend anyone. Consequently the movie lacks pace, a decent plot or any decent acting. The cameo by Harrison Ford sees him miserable grumpy and hopeless - in all of which he is proved right. Carrie Fisher (who I've enjoyed in other movies) seems genuinely incapable of speech and just stares bemused into the middle distance when she appears at all. The whole thing is a mess and we all waited years..."

",2018-05-11 00:00:00,10,"The Force Awakens may not feel totally original, but in my opinion that doesn't take anything away from the film. It's fresh, exciting, loads of fun, and it introduces three fantastic new characters who will inspire a whole new generation of Star Wars fans. Its nods to the old fans make the film even more exciting, with Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the Millennium Falcon making appearances that caused the entire theater to erupt with applause and cheers. Rey and Finn are immensely likable and both Daisy Ridley and John Boyega give great performances, and while Poe doesn't play a huge role, he is still a really charismatic character. BB8 was also awesome. With strong direction, a great script, compelling performances, a rosing score, and great cinematography, the Force Awakens has to be one of my favorite films of all time. Watch it and try not to smile the whole way through. 10 out of 10."
" Exellent movie, stunning effects,but dishonours star wars!
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,6,"The movie in istself is fantastic but when you follow up on the original characters like Luke, Leia and Han you have to do it honourable. This is where JJ totally blew it. Leia's character gave a week impression and killing of han without Luke and Leia's pressence was thin, very thin! And when it comes to Luke Skywalker WTF! His entrence in the movie should have been when the lightsaber was shaking in the snow. The lightsaber should have gone into luke's hand, what an entrence it would have been. Instead we only got to see him for a few seconds in the end, WTF! Besides that I loved the new characters even though Kathleen Kennedy's political correctness had aa very uncomfartable pressence in the movie. This movie would have made it to 10 in MY rating if it weren't for the listed failures."

" Made for longtime fans
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,6,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens came out in 2015. Directed by J.J Abrams(the director who previously revived Star Trek franchise), it's set three decades after Empire's defeat, and follows two major characters who are caught up in search for franchise's main character, Luke Skywalker.The film, I think, has a few strengths and more weaknesses. One of the strongest sides of it are visuals, stylish direction, and soundtrack. It really payed good homage to the very first film, if only we assume that it's strength. I really don't know. Probably it's a strength. For the fans. However, the writing was bad. It was lacking fresh blood. Some of the characters were very similar to older ones, and the plot was also non-original and boring. It seems that only purpose of this film was being plausible and nostalgic to longtime fans. Some scenes were nice and filled with action, but without a decent story, they are meaningless.To sum up, probably it's enjoyable for dedicated fans overall, but I wouldn't recommend it to the rest of the people, other than kids. If you appreciate good writing and story like I do, you will be disappointed."

",2018-04-15 00:00:00,9,"This movie is AWESOME. J.J has directed a fun, action filled Star Wars film that feels like the original trilogy, but also feels very new, Ridley and Boyega lead the acting pack in the film and in turn give us some great performances and new characters to love in the franchise. Ford and Issac also deliver great performances, and Driver feels very whiny, but he does great with what he's given. The beginning and the middle are great, but the third act is very repetitive of A New Hope, but that said Lucas loves rhyming in the SW universe, it's like a poem, so I don't mind it that much because there is plenty of new stuff to detract from that. All in all TFA is a solid Star Wars film there rejouvenated the franchise and shows us that Disney can take care of our beloved universe."
" one word sums it up, plagiarism
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,1,"It's like they just took the story of Episode IV, tweaked it in places, moved a couple of bits around and stuck in bits from the rest of the Original and Prequel series, then thought 'they'll never know'
Well, we did.Let's start from the beginning.Rey is abandoned on a desert planet as a slave and grows up making a living as a junk dealer.
Luke was left with his aunt and uncle on a desert planet (not the same planet but very similar) and made to do similarly menial work and deal with junk dealing Jawa's.
And the slave thing is just a throw-back to Anakin Skywalker in Episode I, then add in that Anakin was owned by the junk dealer Watto.Then an old man on the same planet gives the Resistance pilot (Poe) a segment of a map to Luke Skywalker; thanks to him the First Order appear on the planet and through some space battles a First Order defector (Finn) encounters Rey who helps her to escape the planet aboard the Millennium Falcon.
Here they also meet Han Solo and Chewbacca.
Firstly 'Resistance' is a title given to those who fight AGAINST the people in power, yet they fight FOR the people in power.
Secondly the name 'First Order' is stupid and makes no sense.
The old man, Poe and Finn are basically the equivalent of Obi-Wan in this story, as each fulfil roles Obi-Wan had played with Luke.Han, Rey and co then travel to find a weird alien creature in a bar of aliens whereupon the First Order attacks and the Resistance save them.
I'm reminded of the cantina scene on Tatooine (only without the music) and as for the alien creature it might as well be called Yoda.Rey however is captured by the First Order (led by Kylo Ren) and is taken to the First Orders super weapon where Rey discovers her connection to the Force and begins experimenting with her abilities.
Meanwhile the First Order use their super weapon to destroy the New Republic's governing worlds, and Kylo talks about Rey with his master Snoke.
Just like Luke when he started discovering his connection to the Force and began training with Obi-Wan, the only difference being that Rey has no one to help her. Then you get the Jedi Mind Trick on the Storm Trooper, a force power that Obi-Wan had used on Storm Troopers in Episode IV.
Then there's the First Orders super weapon; it's basically a Death Star built inside a planet, but for what purpose? And the test firing, all I can say is Alderaan.A quick look at the new bad guy 'Kylo Ren' - a boy trained as a Jedi who turned to the dark side and wears a black suit with a mask that changes his voice (too many similarities to Darth Vader to be comfortable, and they really rub it in when he 'prays' to Vader's mangled helmet. At least Darth Vader's mask had a point to it)
And then there's his master Snoke, a weird man with a messed up face who appears as a giant hologram - just as Darth Sideous appeared to Darth Vader in Episode IV.Han, Chewbacca and Finn launch a rescue mission to save Rey while the Resistance plan to destroy the super weapon.
Han, Chewbacca and Finn infiltrate the super weapon and, while searching for Rey, they encounter Captain Phasma and use her to access the computer and dump her down a garbage chute.
Basically Captain Phasma here plays the role of R2-D2 when he accessed the Death Star computer to find Princess Leia in Episode IV, then the garbage chute is just an unnecessary throw-back to the same film.
What's the point of Captain Phasma anyway? A Storm Trooper in a full silver suit whose only role is walking around and talking?Han and Chewbcca then lay charges to destroy the shield generator for the Resistance to attack the super weapon.
Where did they get that idea I wonder, oh wait that's how they destroyed the second Death Star in Episode VI.As they finish planting the bombs Han faces Kylo and reveals he is his father, then Kylo kills him.
It's Episode V in reverse. And Han's death isn't that much of a shock when you think about it, they killed off Obi-Wan in Episode IV, and they couldn't kill off one of the new characters.Just a side note on these new characters, why do they all have one syllable names? Poe, Finn, Rey. Yes there's Kylo Ren, but his real name is Ben. Rey fights Kylo in the forest, however the fight is ended suddenly with no victor when they are separated by an earthquake.
It's basically a rehash of Episode V when Luke fights Darth Vader on cloud city and drops through a filter to escape, except here no one loses a hand.Chewbacca then detonates the bombs and destroyed the shield allowing the Resistance to attack the generator by flying inside and destroying vital components before escaping.
It's the second Death Star repeated almost exactly, except the Millennium Falcon wasn't the ship flying inside.Everyone then escapes the super weapon before it explodes and meets back at the Resistances base.
They like the last second escapes don't they? Anakin on the droid control ship in Episode I, Luke on the Death Star in Episode IV, and Luke and Lando in separate instances on the second Death Star in Episode VI.R2-D2 then 'awakens' and reveals a map from his memory that, with the map segment from the start of the film, shows Luke's exact route across the galaxy.
The film implies that the map R2-D2 had was from the original Death Star in Episode IV, 36 years earlier. If it's that old how does it have Luke's route already plotted on it?
A segment of R2-D2's map however is missing (which is the segment from earlier) how did this get lost, and how did the old man have it?Rey then uses the completed map to find Luke Skywalker to begin her full training as a Jedi.
Just as Luke went to find Yoda in Episode V, and the map from R2-D2 was essentially the same as ghost Obi-Wan telling Luke to go to Dagobah.This film should be renamed 'The Farce Awakens'
The actual title makes no sense anyway, The Force Awakens, was it asleep?After this mass-plagiarism I don't hold out much hope for Episode VIII, not even A New Hope, and definitely wouldn't waste my money on it at the cinema as I had done with this waste of time."
" One of the worst
",2018-04-11 00:00:00,1,You can no longer trust IMDB ratings. They are bought and paid for by the studios. Movie after movie is rated 8 and above and are complete disasters. This movie is like a remake by a 10 year old. Just disgusting.
" More of a remake than a sequel, it relies on nostalgia and spectacle over actual characters and story.
",2018-04-10 00:00:00,5,"In essence a remake of 'A New Hope' as opposed to a proper sequel, the check-box resemblance this long-awaited revival shares to its franchise's debut is genuinely uncanny and sadly staggering since this was the perfect opportunity to try something new considering that the 'Star Wars' moniker is a powerful enough box-office draw to recoup any budget, apparently no matter how exorbitant, and withstand more than a few bad apples (*cough* the prequels *cough*). What's here in 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)' is based on nothing more than nostalgia, a series of slightly sickening ""remember this thing""'s and ""this guy still looks the same but he's grey now""'s that become incredibly tiresome increasingly quickly. If you take away the franchise underlayer you're just left with a hollow, characterless piece that gives you no reason to care and very little actual information despite all its endless exposition. In the end, I was honestly bored even during all of its high-flying fanfare. 5/10"

" Too Nostalgic, but Still Good
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,7,"With a series as beloved as Star Wars, anything is possible. The Force Awakens, the beginning of the sequel trilogy, is quite possibly the most anticipated movie of all time. The fact that it reeled in a record breaking $250,000,000 opening weekend in the U.S. alone is a testament to the popularity of this franchise. So, was it worth the wait? That's an interesting question. For many people, myself included, the nostalgia blinders came with the movie. The anticipation before the opening crawl and the euphoria that that classic opening note brought was an unforgettable experience. This movie brought out happy memories of watching the Original Trilogy for the first time, and the wonder and mystery that the galaxy of Star Wars brought us. However, the movie relies way too much on the nostalgia factor. The best and most memorable things about this movie (aside from that scene, of course) were the opening crawl, the appearance of the Millennium Falcon, the first appearances of the original characters (especially Han and Chewie), and the scene with Darth Vader's helmet. Aside from those things, it's a carbonite copy of the original 1977 movie, with the exact same story arc. There's very little originality, which is a massive detractor. Even the ships and vehicles are exactly the same, with a few exceptions. Of course, Starkiller Base is just another Death Star, even if the way it works is awesome. Even the character's roles feel recycled from the Original Trilogy. Rey is Luke (the desert dwelling, force sensitive protagonist), Finn is Han (The guy who tries to stay out of it but ends up coming back in), Poe is Leia (The one with the droid with the important message), BB-8 is R2-D2 (said droid), Han is Obi-Wan (The mentor who fought in the previous war), and Luke is Yoda (The Jedi who is now a recluse). While this is bad, it doesn't mean the characters are bad. They're not entirely recycled, but the roles they play certainly are.This isn't a bad movie, though. There really is a lot to like. The new characters were pretty good. With Rey, they set her up as a very mysterious figure, one you wonder about regarding who she is and where she's going. While Force Awakens doesn't reveal any of that, it sets it up for later installments. (By the way, this review is judging TFA independently from Last Jedi). Finn goes from being a cowardly deserter to someone who stands up and fights for his cause. Poe's nothing to write home about. Kylo Ren is simultaneously the best character in this movie and the worst. He's the best at the beginning, when you first see him in the black armor with the hood up. He looks awesome. Without the helmet, he's not so great. BB-8 is just about the cutest droid/robot ever. Also extremely marketable. Snoke was great. Han and Chewie really stole the show, mostly because of how long its been since they had screen time together. And also, unlike with the Prequels, when you know what's going to happen, as you've probably seen the Originals, there's a feeling of suspense where you know the characters you've grown to love are in danger, and you desperately want to see them come out OK. Oh, and, you know that feeling when you really want to talk about a movie spoiler but you can't because not everyone saw it as early as you? Yeah. This really went into effect here.Upon the first viewing of this movie, the nostalgia factor made it appear much better than it actually is. I thought this movie was a solid 9/10 after seeing it for the first time. It really isn't. It's still a good movie, though. Most of the callbacks to the original trilogy were welcome, the visuals are spectacular, John Williams continues his perfect track record, and most importantly, it got us interested in where they would take the series with the next installment."
" Superb
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,10,"Thankfully, the Star Wars franchise can get back to fun, and character, and unpredictability. After the durge created by the flaccid prequel trilogy, where there was no emotion, nor effort to wield a lightsaber, and no need to develop personality, it's great to see an unhinged evil character, an uncertain female protagonist, and an awesome droid! Fanboys will obviously lament not having back stories and canon adherence to ""the force"", or that stuffy old men aren't as prolific in this new version, but this is the way forward, not dwelling in the past. Lucas proved he was no director with EPS 1-3, so it is great to have the mantle handed over to film makers."
" Absolute garbage. Wish I could rate it 0.
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,1,"A little after minute 5 a begin to feel uncomfortable. Towards the end of minute 8 nausea is just around the corner. Minute 10, I begin to vomit. A minute later, again. By minute 16, the bucket is filled and I decide that my guts are more valuable than the crap J.J. Abrams and Disney did. You guys suck!
I'm still a fan of Star Wars ... yeah, ... of the old episodes!
Hollywood! It's time to start thinking about putting an end to the saga. Don't be so greedy. Do it while you're still at the top. After that, it won't be worth a plugged nickel."
" Star Wars: The Next Generation
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,9,"I find it harder with every passing year to take an interest in new release movies, and even I was more interested in newer films I would need them to sink in before reviewing. However, this is Star Wars we're talking about! When it was first announced back in 2012 that a new trilogy of Star Wars movies was to be made, my initial reaction was ""It will be better than the prequels, but will still suck"". The filmmakers had the gargantuan task of winning back all the cynical, jaded Star Wars fans like myself; I don't think many people were jumping for joy when a new trilogy was announced. As more announcements about Episode VII came to light such as the film's apparent use of practical effects and that it was going to be shot on film I compared it to a politician making false election promises; in other words, it's a trap! Then came the first teaser and I couldn't complain. It actually looks like what I want a Star Wars film to look like, but no, I'm not getting sucked in that easy! With the second teaser, I finally gave up; ""shut up and take my money!"". While counting down the days towards this film's release my love for Star Wars was reawakened.I almost love The Force Awakens, I almost think it's an excellent film. 80% of aspects in the film I am over the moon about and exceeded my expectations; 20% I am indifferent towards. As the movie begins there is no 20th Century Fox fanfare, but the silence over the LucasFilm logo works in its own way; plus at least there isn't an insane amount of opening logos like most movies today. As soon as I seen ""A long time ago..."" and the opening crawl I was in full goosebumps mode. Although why does the crawl state ""Episode VII"" when the marketing does not? Due to this, I expected the crawl not to state the episode number, which means they're acknowledging the prequels as canon, but whatever, those are in the past. The text in the crawl was perfect and the opening shot of a star destroyer hovering over a planet in the background, such striking imagery. The opening with the attack on the Jakku village actually reminded me of Apocalypse Now, surprisingly intense and even a bit violent. When Finn has the blood of another stormtrooper draped over his helmet, I already became emotionally invested in this character, and I haven't even seen his face; if that's not impressive then I don't know what is. The landscapes of Jakku themselves had that sense of Laurence of Arabia grandeur and those shots of the downed star destroyers in the background are poster worthy material.From the trailers, I got the impression the movie achieves the right balance between offering nostalgia but also giving us something new. The classic characters aren't just there for nostalgia's sake but they actually have important roles in the story. However if you told me that I would be raving more about the new characters as opposed to revisiting the old characters, I would have had the reaction of ""yeah right!"". I can't decide which character I love the most. Daisy Ridley without a doubt steals the show while her banter with Finn couldn't be more fun to watch. Poe Dameron on the other hand, what a cool MF. He's not necessarily the most complex character but he doesn't have to be. He has that adventure serial, flyboy, pretty boy type charm; a guy you would just love to hang out with.Captain Phasma, dam! I remember when I first saw her in the second trailer my instant reaction was, ""Wow! that is freakin' badass!"". She has the same type of appeal Boba Fett has, a 'man with no name' type who has few lines and only appears in a handful of scenes but leaves an indelible impression. I know this will sound like sacrilege to Star Wars fans but screw it, Captain Phasma > Boba Fett. I also loved the other notable villain General Hux, a character who is one dimensional in the best possible way. He's just so delightfully evil and his speech on Star Killer Base in which he lays on the full Nazi vibes gave me the chills. I'm so glad they brought back the British bad guys, one of many aspects of Star Wars sorely missed in the prequels. To me, Star Wars isn't Star Wars without generals with sinister English accents.I wonder if Kylo Ren is intended to be a satire on fanboyism with his extreme idolisation of Darth Vader. Talk about a villain you feel sorry for, you condone his actions but completely understand why he does what he does. But what really fascinates me about Kylo Ren is the fact that he's a whiny teenager, and when you think whinny teenager and Star Wars you probably think of Anakin Skywalker in Episodes II and III - except Kylo Ren is Anakin Skywalker done right. With Kylo Ren being the son of Han and Leia I can now say the Star Wars saga is a soap opera centered on the Skywalker/Solo family, making Star Wars the only soap opera to date I can say I like (well from Part IV onwards). Which brings me to my next point, Han Solo died! My favourite movie character of all time, killed by his own son. As soon as Han steps on that platform with no hand railings and a chasm below him I just knew this is it, he's going to die. Chewie's roar in response to witnessing Han's death says it all; Han Solo (1977-2015). Luke Skywalker, on the other hand, is in the film at the very end for about 20-30 seconds and doesn't speak, yet his appearance in the movie is still strangely satisfying. This along with Han's death shows this movie has balls, and I respect it so much for that.The Force Awakens is the darkest Star Wars film to date, even more than The Empire Strikes Back, but they still manage to counter this with the lightheartedness and the humour. Speaking of humour, I can say this is the funniest Star Wars film to date. Rey knowing more about the Falcon than Han and BB8's using a lighter to give a thumbs up, comic brilliance.So what am I indifferent about in The Force Awakens? One of my issues with is the CGI standing out among the practical effects. The character of Maz Khanta for example, she seems like an interesting character but her computer-generated appearance takes me out of the film. Couldn't she be a puppet or a person in a costume? I feel the character's appearance could and should have been accomplished with practical effects. Yoda was a puppet in Episode I and CGI in Episode II, perhaps this trilogy could do this in reverse? Granted I am a practical effects purist (and of course I am overjoyed by the film's extensive use of practical effects), and any use of CGI in a movie which is a follow up to a trilogy features the greatest and most memorable practical effects in cinema history is going to stand out. When I first saw Supreme Leader Snoke I was almost about to lose it. Are you kidding me? A giant humanoid who is 100s of feet tall in Star Wars? It was like nuke the fridge all over again. However, when we see Snoke is a giant hologram, I had a huge sigh of relief and even thought ""that's actually pretty clever"". However, I do still find his CGI appearance to be problematic. I also wasn't keen on Han escape scene; the CGI creature appeared rather generic and the action in the scene itself was not well executed.The John Williams score itself does not particularly stand out. While it's always nice to hear classic Star Wars themes again, the new compositions aside from Rey's Theme are not very memorable. They get the job done but I doubt you'll find yourself humming them like every piece of music in the original trilogy. Although the truth I wasn't expecting any of the new compositions to stand out as John Williams hasn't composed a truly great film score in my opinion since Catch Me If You Can.Perhaps the film's biggest fault is that it will never be the original trilogy, it will always be in its shadow; well for me at least anyway. The Force Awakens may grow on me more with when I see the bigger picture unveiled with the next two films, but I can say two hours flew by. I did check the time once, but because I didn't want it to end. I was craving answers and wanted more. The movie leaves questions unanswered and lets your imagination fill in the blanks, unlike the prequels which spoon-fed information. I still want to see The Force Awakens again. Reviewing any Star Wars film is no easy task as I could literally write pages and pages of thoughts. Just like the original trilogy, I could take any scene and talk about it in depth and talk about every little moment or touch I loved.In short: Star Wars is back baby!"

Fire the people who hired the loser. He ruined Star Trek and they give him Star Wars!?!?! He is a serial remaker and rebooter. New ideas and creativity to him is like Donald Trump and a smart idea.btw, my little girl liked the wisecracks and one liners. Yup PG Guidance (maximum age 13) for this trash."
" Biggest disappointment ever!
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,1,"The disappointment is relative to expectations based on following the initial pre-disney movies. One would expect at least a fresh, new story exactly because it was bought over by a separate entity, they should then have taken this awesome concept and tapped into its almost infinite potential. In addition to the movie, so much literature has come out of the whole Star Wars phenomenon, and so much more. But did Disney do the smart thing and risk themselves on a ""new"" road? NO. THIS IS A REBOOT OF EPISODE 4 and an extremely poor one at that. Its really sad seeing how many people let that fly miles over their heads, but you can draw an almost exact parallel between both, from start till end, except that now instead of one white male protagonist, its one woman and a black person, which I think is both racist and sexist because it seems to insinuate an equality, that it takes a woman and a black person to compensate for one white male, ticking off two elements on their list of ""must haves"" to make the right people happy.
Where in previous non-Disney Star Wars movies one couldn't help but realize the massive and epic size of George Lucas's universe, Disney brought that scale down to a more ""local"" feeling, now it just feels like some vague sci-fi action movie with non-stop CGI, where the overall focus is more on a planet by planet perspective instead of being much more in the background with a more general stellar overview.
An absolute waste of time, just watch the last digitally mastered version of Episode 4, much better."
" It calls to you

It is lead by another helmet covered Dark Lord whose identity is revealed about 50-60 minutes into the film. By this time the other two major characters are developed.Finn (John Boyega) is a storm trooper who joins the resistance. He becomes a love interest, or so it seems (unless they are somehow brother and sister, they did that twist before) of Rey.Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a tech savvy fighter who on one occasion takes a Katniss pose. Her parentage is not revealed in this film, but she acts similar to another famous character and my guess she is the granddaughter of...Oh c'mon they make it obvious.For those who loved the old Star Wars (and I think that is why we are here) there are plenty of identical lines and similar scenes from the original films, including a cantina, search for a droid, and a Death Star type battle...not to mention that scene of which we do not speak.The role of the Emperor is now the Snoke (Andy Serkis) who looks like a giant Lord Voldemort, perhaps the worse part of the production.The film hits upon the nostalgia elements using the same sound track to create emotional and heart pumping scenes. And yes, we can guess the sequel will look like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" because original writing is scarce and that is what sells tickets.Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity."
" Star Wars have awakened
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,10,"1977 people saw for the first time the big title of Star Wars on the big screen, and after Star Wars: The Revenge of The Sith came out 2005 the world known franchise went disappearing. I saw The Force Awakened 2015 on its premiere night and it was clear that people had been waiting long for Star Wars to return to the big screen, and there is no doubt that J.J Abrams must have felt much pressure taking this franchise back to the big screen as it is certainly one of the most loved and respected movie franchises in the world. Much has changed between 1977-2015 and the world we humans live in daily have changed much both for good and for bad. But one of the great changes that have happened in the world is that women and colored people are allowed a bigger role in movie production both in front of the camera and behind it. To see Daisy Ridley and John Boyega as the two main protagonists was an amazing experience as they both looked like they truly enjoyed themselves and both delivered their performances with nothing but excellence. Adam Driver also delivered a solid performance and it was a complete joy to see Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher return to the big screen and to the galaxy far far away. The movie itself was an amazing space adventure form the beginning to end and I thought that J.J Abrams really captured the magic and feeling of Star Wars just as George Lucas did for the first time in 1977. The movie had a very good balance and it had many things that could be enjoyed by the longtime fans but also much new for the new generation whom some witnessed Star Wars for the first time. And yeah I'll admit it. I was one of those guys who suddenly ""got something in his eye"" when Han Solo & Chewbacca came into the shot and Han said: ""Chewie we're home""A must see for all fans of space adventure and definitely for all who love Star Wars!10/10 Amazing!"
" J J Copy and paste of A New Hope, but worse!
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,1,"At first I thought the movie was ok. But seeing the beginning, already disappointed me. J J used the same concept as Episode 4, the evil people are looking for plans of some sort on a desert planet where they meet a person who doesn't know they have the force until the get mentored. Then the mentor gets killed in a relatable fashion. Before that, the new force user needs to go to a cantina to find safe passage to a certain base. 2: You can't just create characters from nothing. Snoke, Rey, Maz, Hux, Phasma, and many more were introduced into TFA. Bu do we get any explaining about them? NO! Because that would make the story different. We don't want the same thing! We want originality! Not like TFA and TLJ. TLJ wasn't as bad, but it had some other issues. Back to the similarities between 4 and 7. Starkiller= Death Star. Trench run again. Someone taken captive gets rescued aboard an imperial/ First Order station or ship gets rescued by someone in a stormtroops outfit. Harrison Ford even talked smack about the movie. SJWs go crazy happy about this movie because they don't know what is really happening! One of the big points in here, is the lack of LOGIC! Even if Luke failed, he would've gone back to his friends and told them what happened and then maybe leave. He wouldn't just leave because he was looking for something. And If Leai can sense when Han died, then how can't she sense Luke? I know he has blocked himself off from the force. But she connected to him in TLJ when he didn't reconnect yet. Han randomly dissappeared for no reason. Oh hey I'm going to leave my life because I wanted to. I don't care about finding Luke or staying with Leai, I'd rather haul crap. 4. MAREY SUE. Do I even need to explain? She was good at EVERYTHING! She knows everything for no reason. Living on a desert planet without education. Knows how to fly almost perfectly, somehow saved the Millennium Falcon from blowing up by removing something that not even Han cared for. Rey=Luke, Snoke=Palpatine, Kylo=Vader, Hux=Tarkin, Poe=Leia, BB-8=R2D2, etc. How is this storyline considered a great movie? I don't like what the media says about this movie. It doesn't take a genius to know that it's not a good movie. Anything is better than TFA. If you think I'm kidding, don't test me. Prequels were so much better because they had ORIGINAL CONTENT EVERYWHERE! Sure some things were really bad, but I didn't think thy were horrible. They were showing the progression of Anakin's fall to the dark side and the clone wars. I think the millennial are back at it again. They be too blind to really see TFA and what it really is. About 1/4or more of the money that Disney got, was money that probably wants refunded. WAKE UP EVERYONE! ARE WE BLIND?! DEPLOY THE GARRISON. PUT ACTUAL ORIGINALITY IN FRONT OF LAZY COPY AND PASTE! TFA sucks. I don't care what others say, because it seems o be more true on the side that thinks that it was a horrible movie than the ones that are mostly too blinded by media comments of it then actually looking at it."
" a flawed but a good movie
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,7,"The force awakens has few flaws but it does a lots of things right, the actors do a good job of flushing out the characters but there are some wasted actors like mark hamill and Max von Sydow, the soundtrack is really good, John Williams did a really good job, as you may know the force awakens has the same plot as new hope but it does in different way, for example the cantina scene is in both new hope and the force awakens but they have different purposes, in new hope 
the cantina scene purpose was to introduce han and chew, the force awakens cantina scene purpose was to split up the group, I can go on and explain the purpose of scenes that match new hope, in conclusion the the force awakens is a fun movie, it has its flaws but it has a lot of good stuff in it."
" Barely Even Star Wars
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,4,"The other Star Wars movies all connect and clearly link in the same universe. However, in the Force Awakens, despite a few key characters from the original trilogy, most of the characters are new. There isn't the slightest hint about how it could even possibly connect to the other trilogies. The biggest villain, Snoke, seems to have just appeared out of nowhere. It is very hard to adjust to this being a Star Wars movie when it is unclear how the plot developed, where most of the characters came from, and how new, important planets just seemed to appear. If it were the first movie of the series I would say this is a great movie, but what I wanted was Star Wars and The Force Awakens just didn't give me that."
" You Will Watch Star Wars VII
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,10,"Star Wars VII truly met the hype and excitement for the reboot of a saga that has been timeless. This is because of the how Star Wars impacted American culture through as Vincent Canby calls ""(i)t's both an apotheosis of Flash Gordon serials and a witty critique that makes associations with a variety of literature that is nothing if not eclectic: Quo Vadis?, Buck Rogers, Ivanhoe, Superman, The Wizard of Oz, The Gospel According to St. Matthew, the legend of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table."" This is because how this movie invokes all of these amazing tales to be amazing. Also Star Wars is a highly recognized film within our American culture with it making the top one hundred grossing films at filmsite.org. Star Wars VII is set thirty years after the fall of Emperor Palpatine and the crippling of the Galactic Empire. The rise of the First Order causes the force to truly awaken. And new heroes were born when old ones failed. Although people might say that Star Wars VII is not as good as the original trilogy the following reasons prove otherwise. This movie is filled with the nostalgia of old characters returning and the similarities to Star Wars IV. The new elements make good use of the Star Wars universe to be very interesting.
 
 This movie is filled with the nostalgia of old characters like Princess Leia, Han Solo, and Luke Skywalker returning. The entrance of the Millennium Falcon was great as it shows how the force guided to one thing after another and it was just by luck. Next, when meeting Han Solo, he says that the force and Jedi are real. This gives off nostalgia with relating back to him, in Star Wars IV, saying that he did not believe in the Jedi or the force. The most exciting entrance is of the Resistance because as the heroes are in a almost defeated position against them, the Resistance use their ships to defeat and make the First Order retreat. Not only is the nostalgia excellent but the new elements of the characters and plot line are great.
 
 The plot line of trying to find Luke Skywalker and defeat the First Order's Star Destroyer puts a very entertaining spin on the Star Wars IV plot line. The magnificent light saber duels and other battles are full of tense moments and that has a hint of space soap opera. The grand music by John Williams full of brass fanfare gives a strong feeling in tense situations. The light but filled emotionally charged flute melody of Han Solo meeting Princess Leia brings us happily back to them two in the original trilogy. The beginning, that has a resemblance to the opening of private Ryan, is amazing as Finn's amazing acting with realizing the evil of the First Order and J. J. Abrams depiction of the darkness of their war like World War II is a wonderful opening. With that the introduction of Kylo Ren using the force to stop a laser blast is surprising as we never saw a Sith do that before. Also as people say that Disney would make Star Wars VII have a happy ending, like most of their movies, there is a very tragic event in the movie that would strike any movie watcher sad. Finally, the amazingness of the resistance being able to defeat an entire star destroying and planet sized weapon was fun to be able to see how that unfolded. Star Wars VII does not disappoint to Star Wars fans missing old characters and the grand thrill of a space odyssey. On contrary to these reasons, there are some people that do not feel this way and feel a varying degree of dislike for the movie.
 
 Many movie reviewers feel like that it is not as good as the originals, a representative from this group is miller-93442. Although he criticized about Finn, the storm trooper, his use of ""Just clueless"" should be used for his view on Finn and how he does not take into account his growth throughout the film with overthrowing his old stormtrooper ways and protecting his friends in this ""sword fight."" Also the ""technology"" not being improved is countered by the ""starkiller base"" which was made to basically show that there is greater technology. His ignorance in not carefully analyzing the significance of the saying ""Luke was on what appears to be earth"" does not take into account the main goal of the entire movie finally achieved. Finally he does not take into account the point of this movie to be nostalgic. Sometimes there is more heart and soul to the movie than what an individuals bias is.
 
 The nostalgia of the this movie was greatly executed for maximum enjoyment. When I watched Star Wars VII, on opening day, me and the audience clapped in excitement for every time that a classic character appeared. The plot line integrated with the new characters were very dynamic, changing throughout the film, and interesting to watch. The bad reviews does not take into account the film and has their own bias inserted. Star Wars is back and ready to take over the box office with its new friends."

" 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is a Magical, Entertaining, and a Great Movie-Going Experience
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,9,"Fans will say that The Force Awakens is a retread of the original 1977 classic, and to a certain degree they are right. However, the film's director J.J. Abrams is able to captivate the audience and balance an old story with a new story that will thrill not only kids but adults alike. From the new and old cast to the visual effects to the emotional storytelling, The Force Awakens sets up a new trilogy masterfully similar to The Fellowship of the Ring for The Lord of the Rings. To be honest, I haven't loved a new Star Wars movie so much in my lifetime since I first watched the originals and this one will definitely go down as one of the greatest of all time even with its editing and predictability issues!Overall Score- 9.3/10For more of my 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' review and more blockbuster movie news & reviews check out my blog at : mtmovieblog.wixsite.com/mtmovieblog"

" A promising yet inherently flawed start to a trilogy
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,7,"I have to admit when I saw this for the first time I was absolutely spellbound, I thought 'finally another Star Wars movie with charismatic characters and practical filmmaking, this is a massive step up from the prequel trilogy'. However, I was skimming over an important factor into why this movie was loathed by hardcore Star Wars fans, the 'playing it safe' derivativeness used to sucker in fans.In fairness there is lots to like about The Force Awakens, the cinematography and look of the film is astounding and you can tell they aren't just filming in front of green screens. Harrison Ford excellently reprises his role as the always likeable Han Solo. There are a plethora of engaging and exciting action sequences reminiscent of the original trilogy. Kylo Ren is a nuanced villain who gets constantly called to the light and values Vader as some hero he must imitate.Here's where the flaws kick in that fans giving this movie '1/10' have already highlighted. While Rey is a charismatic heroine she isn't all that interesting. Even by the next instalment we still know nothing about her and she almost always does everything right, a Mary Sue to be more blunt. Finn has an interesting backstory but apart from that he is trying to do his best Will Smith impression, attempting to create the same likeable persona. There are some original spins that doesn't make the movie a 'shot for shot' remake of the original Star Wars, but to say it isn't derivative is an under statement. It's cool they create a Death Star out of a planet which gets its power from the sun. Instead of Death Star plans the rebellion is trying to obtain a map of Luke Skywalker's whereabouts. Apart from that, yes it's a soft remake.Overall I'd say it was a promising yet inherently flawed start to a trilogy."
" The Keywords Say It All

This film is full of torture, betrayal and lack of creativity.

" Star Wars did not need a reboot
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,2,"The Force Awakens was a fun if uninspired movie, that fuses a cast of new quirky characters almost seamlessly with a number of old time favorites. And the onscreen chemistry is great. The adventure is exciting if already done and the pacing is very Star Wars. While Kylo Ren was a week and unconventional villain, that give him the potential the be a more interesting villain(Ante herow?) than usual. And the ominous supreme leader Snoke fills the niche of evil mastermind well enough. None of this however saved the movie form a number of unfortunate truths. The most obvious of which is that the movie is actually A New Hope but different and in a decisively worse way. Almost trope for trope the force awakens was a copy of A New Hope. Not to say there weren't some very different elements but the skeleton was still there. Orphan hero growing up on a desert planet, secret data carried by a droid that speaks in beeps, new heroes' meat old heroes, old hero sacrifices himself in front of new hero. And before it is all over a bar fight at a really sketchy bar. Retooling the old movies however was not as bad as what they had to do to the Star Wars Universe to do it. Taking the rebellion back to square one betrayed the entire first trilogy as a whole. Sending Han and Chewy back into the smuggling business undoes all the character evolution he underwent in the first 3 movies, and requires that we imagine Laya would just let him go. And there is a huge plot whole established with the introduction of Supreme Leader Snoke. All of the Sith were destroyed. Twice in fact, the first time before A Phantom Menace, the second time at the end of Return of the Jedi. So where did this new guy come from especially since he seems so old. I must say that although it was an enjoyable movie it's popcorn value dos not make up for the fact that they had to reboot the universe to retell us a story we liked but in a worse way. Say what you want about the screen writing of the prequels, but you must admit the story was fantastic. The Plot of The Force Awakens leaves much to be desired and that is as thoroughly un Star Wars as a movie can be."
" A step in the right direction after the prequel trilogy
",2018-02-22 00:00:00,8,"Unless you've been living under a rock for the past 40 years you may have heard of a little movie franchise called 'Star Wars'. After being thrilled by the original trilogy, fans had to wait more than a decade to be cruelly disappointed by an underwhelming trilogy of prequels. However, following LucasFilm's acquisition by Disney, the stage was set for a new group of filmmakers to take a crack at extending the storyline. Whether the results would be worthy of the title of 'Star Wars' was anybody's guess.J.J. Abrams was given the daunting task of resuming the series where George Lucas had left off. It seemed like a promising idea since only a few years earlier Abrams had managed to breathe new life into the rival 'Star Trek' franchise. Stars from the original trilogy reprising their iconic roles also boded well for the direction of the series.The story picks up three decades after the end of the original trilogy, at a time when the Jedi have all but disappeared and a new oppressive power has risen from the ashes of the Empire. Not a bad setup, particularly when the absence & imminent reintroduction of Luke Skywalker propels the story. However, there does seem to be a bit of a 'been there, done that' feel to the story, as if it's too close to the original at times. Bringing in 'Empire Strikes Back' & 'Return of the Jedi' screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan was a wise choice if they wanted to give the movie a similar flavour to its predecessors but it also made it more obvious how close the characters and plot are to those of the original trilogy. They're fine on their own but it's inevitable to compare them to the iconic originals, with which they couldn't possibly hope to compete.As far as the cast goes, it's pretty good. Having Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill & Carrie Fisher back gave the movie legitimacy and it was good to see Anthony Daniels & Peter Mayhew again as well. Of the newcomers, Adam Driver is the clear standout as conflicted villain Kylo Ren, who draws more than a little inspiration from Darth Vader. Relative unknowns Daisy Ridley & John Boyega were appealing as the main heroes of the movie and they at least offered a different spin on past archetypes used in the series. The supporting cast is peppered with recognizable actors & actresses but I wouldn't say that any of their performances rival their best work, which isn't to say that their performances aren't satisfactory.From a visual standpoint, the movie represents an improvement over the relentlessly CGI-infused prequel trilogy. A concerted effort was made to utilize practical effects whenever possible and I think that it benefited the movie's overall feel. There's a welcome similarity to the original trilogy and even the more ambitious special effects are generally fluid and believable. J. J. Abrams's direction is likewise ably handled and John Williams was really the only acceptable choice to provide a score.Overall, ""The Force Awakens"" is a nicely executed sci-fi/action movie that puts the 'Star Wars' series back on track and leaves you wanting to continue the story with ""The Last Jedi"". I don't anticipate it becoming as well-loved as any of the entries in the original trilogy but it's a noble achievement in its own right. The prequel trilogy may have left a bad taste in the mouths of a lot of fans (personally, I think that only the last chapter was really worthwhile) but they shouldn't have any fear that they would be better off avoiding this continuation of the story."
" Shame Disney!
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,1,"From 2012 the dark side of the force is winning!
Not worth a single star!"
" A New Return Of The Jedi
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,9,And...A new film rises. More fight scenes and great places. I think this is my favorite Star Wars film
" Few risks, fan service and opening some questions
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,7,"My title sums up this movie. You want to see the Falcon? A cool red light-saber? Han and Chewie? And see a bunch of X-wings destroy the Deat... I mean Starkiller base? Well, you'll get it. 
Casting is pretty decent, Poe, Finny and even BB8 are kinda okay. Rey, I still don't know what to think of her. A bit too naïve and innocent in my opinion but she's not annoying at least. And Kylo... Kylo is pretty much the risk this movie has taken, by making him look really awesome with his outfit, saber and mask aaaaand surprising you when you see his face. I think it was a good choice in the end.
It's a solid and simple star wars movie. A bit of plot and ""star wars science"" holes, like how in such a huge galaxy can they see the shot of starkiller and the explosion of the planets? Unless they're in the same system, not possible. During the fight after Maz Cantina gets blown up... where did everyone go? The cantina was full. Somehow only Han and friends get out of the debris. Rey's awakening is a bit weird but why not. Personally I would have made her force sensitive when she's running after Finn who's going to get eaten by the weird worm creatures on Han's ship. Not even going to ask why did those creatures insta kill all the bad guys but they capture Finn... with all those tentacles, don't ask. 
Anyways, a good and entertaining star wars movie. Good action, decent actors, good CGI. Just a bit too predictable."
" Very flawed, but watchable.
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,5,"If you compare this film to the original trilogy even the prequels it's not very good. The humor is off, the cinematography is off, and a lot of other things are just... Off. it's hard to explain the new characters are rather interesting but most of them aren't fleshed out. Very much to make room for Rey who is your quintessential Mary Sue type of character that the feminists eat up. He does everything right nobody questions her, she's perfect in all the wrong ways. Despite this Finn & Poe Dameron were interesting characters that should have gotten a little bit more character development, not to mention kylo Ren was actually a somewhat intriguing villain until he took his mask off. Despite this it's still create the foundation that could have been used properly and fortunately it was not. On its own, it's an okay film but I consider even the prequels to be more that Ventures and exciting. A sign of the times I suppose."
" 7 but still my least favorite
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,6,"I have to be honest with myself. For some reason when I watched this movie it felt like there was something missing. The prequels to the original get so much constant hate and criticism and no one points out the positive things about those movies.. .. I actually enjoyed watching those movies more than this one despite some cheesy lines, over use of CGI and annoying characters like JaJa.. 
 I feel this way because episodes 1-3 still had that magic touch.. I don't know what it is but it still maintained a certain type of feel and flow of the original movies. It had things about those movies that were very memorable, original, yet still felt familiar.. That is what I feel was lacking in this one. There was nothing about it that really stood out.. It tried to be Star Wars so hard, but it failed. It just felt like ""someone else"" was trying to copy and remake the Star Wars theme.. None of the characters were memorable.. None of the fight scenes were really memorable.. Each one of the Star Wars movies before it had something that really stood out . I could watch all six of the Star Wars movies over again .... But this one I feel like after watching it once.. I don't really care if I see it again. Even Harrison Ford didn't look into it. It was like someone dragged him out of bed and forced him to do this movie.. His acting was very lack luster.  There was no imagination in this movie but simply a rehash without the same flow and rhythm of the other six.. 
Here's what stands out for me. . 
Ep 1 - Darth maul.. 10x better of a character.. the one in force awakens felt more like watching a space balls villain .... Pod racing.. That really stood out.. The music and fight scenes with darth maul... Awesome acting by liam Neeson and McGreggor.. Ep2- The clone wars battle scene was a pretty epic battle and very memorable. Seeing yoda younger and actually fighting was memorable even if it was funny to watch. A lot of memorable acting and synergy between Anakin and Obi Wan.. Ep3- was dark, told the story that lead up to the originals... The final battle was very memorable.. the ending stood in my mind for awhile... The Emperors acting was on point.. Force awakens- The best thing i liked about it really was the new droid.. Oh and if you want to count a progressive approach having a woman and black guy be the main characters.. but I don't really care about any of that.  My score... originals were my favorite. followed by rogue one and the prequels.. Force Awakens was the least enjoyable to watch for me."
" The EU died for this? Seriously?
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,1,"So my review is quite biased, being a fan of what used to be the EU (now legends), having read more than 50 books and played many of the now non-canon games. Therefore, take this review with a grain of salt. TL;DR at the bottom.All in all, I consider this film bad, especially under special consideration of the successor ""The last jedi"" and why this trilogy is doomed. Why though:The story. This movie is almost a 1:1 copy of a new hope. You have probably read that before, but it is astonishing now much of the concept has been taken to try to please the crow by giving them something they are familiar. Well, not familiar, but almost identical, which makes, in itself, the plot almost ridiculous. First of all, between ROTJ and TFA we are thrown into a situation where, after the supposed victory of the rebels, we are somehow back to square one: The rebels are a minority, the Empire (now called the first order), built yet another Death star, because it worked so well before TWICE /s. Seriously. All in all, our childhood heroes Lukeleiahan have achieved nothing, their victory is meaningless.Okay, maybe we are up to a fresh restart of the galaxy, its setting. Maybe we have good characters...or maybe notThe characters. Oh boy. Where do we start?So first of all, our heroine, Rey, is close to being omnipotent. Yes, I know it sounds stupid, but it's actually baffling how overpowered the character is. First of all the actress follows the stereotypical, new way of acting, as seen by many young actresses like Jennifer Lawrence. As it seems, ""acting"" today means dropping your jaw, opening your eyes, occasional yelling and otherwise not being capable of controlling your face to mirror an appropriate emotion. Nevertheless,
our heroine can do everything and everybody likes her the moment they see her (even Leia hugs her after Han died, not even Chewie whom she'd known for DECADES). She immediately knows the Millenium Falcon just as good as Han Solo. Alright. She grabs Anakin's lightsaber and immediately gets 10 level ups...Alright... She takes a friggin lightsaber, a weapon as deadly and hard to control that jedi needed years to not chop off things by accident and pummel the bad guy. I mean, if it were Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One, a being made by the force, I could get that. But she is NOBODY. It's just bad Character design and it gets worse by such a bad actress.So how about the bad guy? Darth Caedus...oh wait.
Okay, so they took Ben from the Legends books... But they made him the Solo children (Because Han and Leia had so much to do with Ben Kenobi instead of, I don't know, maybe Luke, his student?!?). Maybe he is a cool guy...aaaaand he sucks. Seriously. Remember all the previous baddies from the Star wars movies? Darh Maul? Tyrannus? Sidious? Vader? Remember when they slashed their light saber in an emo phase all over their star ship and whined about their granddaddy issues? I see the idea of introducing a mentally unstable teenager, and they could have made an interesting character out of Kylo from the knights of Ren (who will never be mentioned again), but here are the flaws:
First of all, I dislike Adam Driver. He could play Gollum in Lord of the rings without CGI. Hell, I was yelling ""put back on your helmet, you hideous monste....oh, that's Adam Driver... PUT IT BACK ON"" and his acting talent doesn't convince me either. But most of all, he seems to be quite skilled in the force (he can stop blaster shots in mid-air, even Vader couldn't do it) but then he gets shot by a Wookie bowcaster (he is severely injured, I get that), but loses to Mary Sue WHO HAD NOT HAD A SINGLE LESSON IN LIGHTSABER FIGHTING, and uses it like some wooden stick. Even if he were injured, he would be able to just force choke or crush her or pull the light saber off her hands. They totally messed everything up with this character by being inconsistent to the maximum.The other characters, okay: So we have a new C3PO-Jar Jar character, now played by John Boyega - the clown character of the series, only good for a few Star-Wars-untypical jokes, who is supposed to be a main character, but actually does nothing except being clumsy, afraid of everything and completely overwhelmed by everything. Then e have the new R2D - BB8, a new way of selling toys and Poe Dameron. I don't even remember his input.The old characters are also butchered in every possible way. From the little context we get we know that Han is not a Rebel hero, but regressed to being a smuggler again, Leia does Leia things (but somehow learns to fly through outer space in the next movie and survive for quite a while), and Luke is going to be a sulking, bitter old hermit on some rocks. Great, you fuckers, you didn't introduce new, interesting characters but you also butchered the old one. Great job!The big flaw comes from the fact that this movie has a successor, though. The last jedi ignores EVERYTHING that happened in this movie. AGAIN. WE destroy the star killer base here. Cool. Next movie: We are running from an ""Empire"" that is still powerful, even after we blew their headquarters with billions of soldiers into pieces. They introduce more characters, because the ones here were boring and they make them pointless AGAIN. We thought Snoke was a powerful and mysterious new Sith Lord? Gotcha! Rey is somebody who is from a powerful force heritage? Nope. It's just a big big mess
TL, DR:
The big, big problem from this Disney Wars franchise comes from the fact that they bought the license but didn't plan around it. They don't have anything to tell us between ROTJ and TFA which makes this new beginning incredibly sloppy, even though it's almost a carbon(ite) copy of episode 4,but they also didn't plan ahead. The 2/3 of the existing trilogy are incoherent, the characters are either powerful beyond anything or emotionally unstable. Everything we knew about the force since the old Republic is meaningless, because everyone can master the force in 2-3 hours and just holding an old lightsaber. Loved, old characters are butchered to create space for socially acceptable factions.You didn't like episode 1-3? At least they had a cohesive strategy for the plots.
Here, you also get the same bad dialogues, (un)funny characters. But they don't give you a plot or direction, disregard everything about the force, fill it with slapstick jokes and mix it together with CGI to create a parody that is called ""Disney Wars: A New Despair- RELOADED"".You could have taken anything from the existing Legends, yet you decided to take a big chunk of poop , paint it C3PO-golden to make a few quick bucks and shit on every fan's face."
" My personal favorite star wars movie
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Was it similar to A New Hope? A little, I guess... but I still absolutely loved this movie. The acting was great, and the editing and effects were both phenomenal. All of the new characters are very likable, and it was awesome to see Han Solo return. I will admit though, that Rey is a little too good at everything. That is fixed a little in The Last Jedi, but still. I still loved her character, though. Han Solo's death scene was handled very, very well. Even though I knew he was dead as soon as he stepped out there, I did start to believe for a second that Kylo Ren had changed. The action is awesome to watch and I loved every second of it. Overall, I really love this movie and the new movies in general. It may not be the best sequel, but on it's own merits this movie knocks it completely out of the park."
" meh
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,5,"Kind of a rehash of the original star wars movie.fairly bad acting and characterization throughout. its not like it was even the younger cast members, who were all pretty wooden. harrison ford though was terrible, he phoned it in like he was bored and didnt want to be there. it reminds me of the lastest installment of die hard when bruce willis just wasn't into it. terrible. carrie fisher was just as bad, rip and all but she clearly needed help, she reminded me of the weird aunt that isnt ready for a nursing home but is starting to lose it. beyond the bad acting, what motivated these characters? nobody knows its a mystery!tldr, not terrible but not good either, would probably be fine for someone who wasn't into the series but a real letdown for fans."
" I liked it a lot.
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,9,Although it stole a lot from the OT i think it set up a lot of things tht made me excited to watch the sequel....unfortunately Rian Johnson ruined it all....but still this film had a nice feeling about it....came with peace and love..didn't wanna rock the boat and ruin what came before it.and i respect tht.
" Star Wars: The Force Awakens - A Soulless, Unnecessary Continuation of the Star Wars Saga
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,4,"Critics have almost universally praised the seventh entry in the Star Wars saga. Most negative critiques of the film have been shrugged off as fanboys being fanboys, to which I respectfully disagree. The Force Awakens should be considered both on its merits as it a) stands alone, in which regard it is an average at best, by the numbers Marvel-style money churner; and b) as the seventh film in a nine-part narrative in which regard it outright fails - shamelessly copying most of its narrative points from the originals whilst simultaneously working to undo what came before and offering no logical consistency in the series as a whole.a) As a standalone film i) One-dimensional characterisation
The most glaring issue with the film is its lack of meaningful characterisation and character development. Take Rey, our protagonist, for example: with no prior experience and no training, Rey is able to best every other character around her - whether it's both fixing and piloting the Millennium Falcon with more skill than its owner; beating up numerous thugs on Jakku; resisting and overpowering the primary antagonist, Kylo Ren, during his interrogation of her using the Force; squaring off against and defeating said antagonist in a lightsaber duel at the film's climax; or even inexplicably being able to understand Wookie language when no one else can. There is little to no character development for our protagonist in this film, and little is left in the way of potential development for later entries. Sadly, Rey is as bland as heroes come.The film's tendency to overpower its heroes and have them perform unrealistic feats of heroism dispels the audience's suspension of disbelief and eliminates any sense of danger. Poe is the greatest pilot in the Resistance, a fact that is rammed down the throat of the audience, particularly when we are shown Poe blasting multiple First Order TIE fighters out of the sky in the space of mere seconds. Finn (more on him below) is somehow able to hold his own with the film's antagonist, a highly trained and deadly dark Jedi, in a lightsaber duel.Very few characters have been written with authentic traits or backgrounds. Finn's speech, mannerisms and his actions seem completely incongruous with his origins as having been raised from birth to be a soldier (or was it janitor?). Snoke and Hux are archetypal Disney villains with zero intrigue or menace, and most characters on both sides of the fence are inexplicably dumbed down, doing and saying dumb things and not behaving in the way one would expect of experienced military leaders. The film does offer a small handful of characters with some intrigue though. Kylo Ren is a genuinely interesting character - conflicted, dark, and brimming with potential possibilities. Harrison Ford shines in his scenes as Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher does ok with her limited material. However these few are simply not enough to engage the audience in the lives of the characters and propel the story.ii) Contrived storytelling - the 'Mystery Box' approach and the issues therefrom:
In terms of story, the film offers a swathe of narrative threads and mysteries for the audience to chew on: who are Rey's parents; who are the knights of Ren; why is Luke in hiding; who is Snoke; on it goes. In typical JJ Abrams fashion, it's likely that we are being sold mystery for the sake of mystery - do we really expect that all of these questions will be satisfactorily answered? (Having recently seen The Last Jedi the answer is unequivocally no). Ultimately, this style of mystery-manufacturing serves to detract from the overall narrative, with good story telling and the finer details, which make or break a film, being pushed aside in favour of a contrived plot device. The lack of focus on these key ingredients also opens the film up to a multitude of plot holes (many of which are evident in other sections of this discussion).b) As a continuation of the Star Wars seriesi) Plot and world-building incongruity:
The prequel trilogy chronicled the rise of the galactic empire and Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side. While the films were undoubtedly flawed, they existed in and built upon the universe crafted in the original trilogy. The originals chronicled the rebel alliance's subsequent desperate attempts to overthrow the Empire; continued the arc of the Skywalker family; and culminated in a thrilling, cathartic victory - the Empire is overthrown, Anakin Skywalker redeemed, and Luke's journey from farm boy to saviour of the galaxy complete. The Force Awakens undoes all that from the opening crawl. None of the overarching plot in this latest entry makes any sense when viewed as a continuation of that story:With the original trilogy and with what we are shown in the prequel trilogy, the impression is given that the Empire is vast and indomitable. The conflict between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire spans an entire galaxy. However, following the fall of the Empire, the First Order - apparently a remnant - have constructed their own, far more powerful Death Star and use it to swiftly obliterate the Republic. No explanation is given as to how the First Order could have risen to power unchecked by the Republic and the Resistance, nor how it is possible that the entire galaxy-spanning Republic was able to be wiped out in a single stroke by Starkiller base. Furthermore, why is there a Resistance in the first place? What is the relationship between the Resistance and the Republic? None of this is adequately explained.Our plucky heroes from the first trilogy, Han and Luke - largely responsible for the overthrow of the Empire - have simply given up and gone into hiding following their own personal failures in the interim, jarringly out of character from what one would expect of these well-developed characters.These issues in plotting are symptomatic of shoe-horning a new story into the Star Wars universe where perhaps there should have not been any. The new trilogy has fallen short in finding a logical jumping off point, and the film's makers seem uninterested in providing any narrative cohesiveness.ii) Tonal mismatch:
Tonally, the movie does not gel with the original trilogy. The underlying seriousness of the originals is nowhere to be found, and instead we are given cartoonish dialogue and slapstick. The snide remarks of Han Solo and organic banter of the Han/Luke/Leia trio are here replaced by Marvel's brand of self-aware and modernised jokes which all too often undercut any dramatic tension and dispel the audience' suspension of disbelief. In one scene Rey & Finn in the Millenium Falcon are captured by a much larger vessel, drawn into its gravity well, in what should have been a tense moment. Instead what we are given are Finn & Rey scrambling for a better vantage point, with Finn literally climbing Rey in a scene reminiscent of a Benny Hill sketch. Overall, the film's tone does little to convince us that the story is set in the same narrative universe as those that came before it, feeling more a parody of the originals than a successor.iii) Narrative repetition:
Large sections of the plot of The Force Awakens are blow by blow retellings of A New Hope. I won't go into detail - the parallels are too numerous - suffice to say that they are not so much call-backs as a copying and pasting of major plot points. Were this film a reboot, one could forgive such narrative laziness, however as episode seven of a series the repetition is jarring. This is a transparent and clumsy move to spark nostalgia in existing fans to then pass the torch to their children, the new targets of Disney's marketing.Conclusion
The writers and producers have managed to tick enough checkboxes to ensure that it is not a ""bad"" film, at least in terms of production. The actors all do fine with their material, the visuals are impressive, and the action sequences are good for the most part. But The Force Awakens epitomises superficial, committee based film making of the modern era, unnecessarily continuing the series for the sake of profit and diminishing the story and character arcs of the preceding films in the process. While George Lucas' treatment of the series was certainly influenced by a focus on merchandise sales, with Disney now steering the franchise I'm afraid The Force Awakens is indicative of what we can expect of future entries in the series - a succession of films churned out for broad appeal and maximum profit, with unimaginative storytelling, bland characterisation, forced dialogue, self-aware humour, and a complete absence of heart and originality that made the originals a cultural phenomenon. Peel away the glossy, merchandise-based veneer of The Force Awakens and you won't find much."
" Really very good
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,9,"I'm a Star Wars fan, but not a die hard fan. Maybe that's why I really enjoyed this movie. I was never bored and the characters where very likeable and well written and I liked the plot. Perhaps the die hard fans are being too hard on this movie because it didn't give them what they had imagined."
" What happened to Star Wars?
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,5,"This movie was okay, but not even close to as good as the original trilogy."
" Such a fun time
",2018-01-13 00:00:00,8,J.J. Abrams did an amazing job with this movie. I find it a lot of fun and a really enjoyable watch. I love all the new characters introduced and find the stories of Rey anf Kylo Ren particularly interesting. I also love how they have introduced the new characters and built up the mystery surrounding Luke Skywalker. The film is stunning and the use of practical effects breathtaking. What an achievement.
" Star Wars: Episode VII - The Return on the Investment
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,1,"My one expectation going into this movie was that it would be better than the prequels, which were abysmal. It failed even in that regard.I hesitate even to call this a movie. All the reviews you may have read referring to this as a reboot as opposed to a sequel, are apt. I would go a step further and call it a cynical exploitation of fandom, and an attempt to reverse engineer that which made the original trilogy so successful and repackage it without creating anything new or risking Disney's $4 billion investment. Say what you will about the prequels: bad writing, bad casting, bad acting, pandering to little kids, shamelessly designed toward merchandising; they were at least a continuation of the original story and contained some new ideas. This movie, on the other hand, was in such a hurry to make you feel A New Hope/Empire Strikes Back ""feels"" that it plunked you down in the same settings, with the same characters, and the same objectives, changing only the names. Tatooine is now Jakku. Luke is now Rey. Obi Wan is now Luke. Yoda is now Maz Kanata. Darth Vader is now Kylo Ren. Emperor Palpatine is now Supreme Leader Snoke. The Rebellion is now the Resistance. The Empire is now the First Order. The Death Star is now Starkiller Base. And on, and on... If you plotted this movie's story beats on a graph they would line up perfectly with those of Episode IV--except that they feel totally unearned and anti-climactic, lacking the proper character development and buildup to carry any real weight. The filmmakers, in this case, were counting on the audience to bring this to the equation and fill these empty ciphers with their memories from the original films. I'm baffled as to why newcomers to this story would care, because even I don't. Well, the detailed galaxy that George Lucas envisioned had much more potential than this, even if he largely failed to realize it in the prequels. There were more worlds to visit, more characters to meet. It seems like any fan could have imagined a better sequel. What happened after the rebels toppled the Empire? What did they put in its place? As leaders of the Rebellion, what role did Luke, Leia, and Han play in that? Not only are these questions never answered, the people in charge of this movie chose to hit the reset button on all of it, either because of a failure of imagination or fear of diverging from the tried and true formula, or some combination of the two. They calculated that you'd like to see Leia, after struggling against the Empire in Episodes IV-VI and finally triumphing over it, still a soldier in that same struggle. They figured you'd enjoy seeing Han Solo, after having ascended to the rank of General in the Rebellion, returned to the life of a smuggler. They squandered all our investment in the previous three movies in favor of trying to remanufacture the experience of seeing them again for the first time--something adults should have known was both futile and impossible.These are not the continuing adventures of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo. Those only exist in your imagination now. And believe me, they're better off there. This is just a bunch of arbitrary, apocryphal claptrap, crapped out by an entertainment megacorp trying desperately to secure a monopoly on childlike wonder and bend it to the will of its shareholders--the second largest of whom, it should be noted, is George Lucas. Jar Jar Abrams is an unoriginal hack, but I don't blame him any more than I blame Darth Vader for doing the Emperor's bidding. Yeah, that's right, I had to get in a ""Jar Jar Abrams"" dig."
" Poorly made fan fiction
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,2,"Not much to add that others haven´t allready written, not real star wars but fan fiction. I had... a bad feeling about this since the beginning. Disney bought star wars, that´s a bad sign. I heard the title: The force awakens. Hm, I thought, that´s not how the force works, the force doesn´t awaken in you or anything. Who is the director. Ah, the one who made ""lost"", that´s a bad sign. Out of curiosity, I had to see how bad Disney could mess this up, and they managed to surpass my expectations in that regard. It´s not a star wars movie, it´s poorly made fan fiction. I do not have the energy to write everything that´s wrong with it, but others have allready done a good job with that. Read those."
" Copy of episode IV
",2018-01-10 00:00:00,1,"Nothing but an unimaginative, poorly written re-hash of episode IV with a 'Mary Sue' main character and plot holes. A lazy attempt by Disney."
" The Force(d) Awakens
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,7,"J.J. Abrams reignites and revitalizes a galaxy far, far away with raw, practical wonder like never before, with a story that feels like more of an unfulfilling reunion show, but an exhilarating reunion nonetheless.
Ever since the prequels, in fact ever since the originals, we (Star Wars enthusiasts) have been anxiously anticipating a return to the Star Wars universe, and ever since it was announced back in 2013, it rose the potential for a brand new trilogy, hopefully out-grown and learned from the prequels, and true to the originals, to create something truly new and extraordinary. 
With a whole new set of characters, in a whole new set of stories, extraordinary, it is not. 
I don't want to bum out the incredibly protective fanbase, but if you're hoping for new planets, a different kind of Star Wars story we'd never seen before, or even an exploration of things you'd only dream of, dream again because Force Awakens takes such a safe route that it almost replicates, frame-by-frame, arch-by-arch ""A New Hope"" in a very respectable, but unnecessary way. 
First and foremost, the problem I have with ""safe movies,"" is there's nothing to hate because no risks were taken. Example given// The Force Awakens.
Now, that's not to say I didn't enjoy the movie by any stretch of the imagination because there's so much to love here.
There's a certain mold that defines Star Wars and J.J. understands that beautifully. What I mean is the franchise's so-called style sort of rides this fine line of being overly-cheesy and overly-romantic in its cinematic experience. And its a style that really only works with Star Wars, but it's also a style that has become beloved and cherished by millions of people on the planet. And that said, ""The Force Awakens"" fully embraces this style and projects it on a stage of film-making, entertainment and execution that is at an incredibly high-level of craft, higher than almost any previous installment. 
It's all there. 
The performances are sensational, and are even better than expected. 
The returnees such as Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill are all terrific. But it's the new cast that's significant in this one, and do they ever steal the show. 
Daisy Ridley plays a wondrous scavenger in Rey, who really is the heart and hope of The Force Awakens, giving us a true female hero for this generation. John Boyega plays a runaway stormtrooper named FN217, or aka Finn, and comes across annoying at times, but plays it in a real ""Star Warsy"" way that's effective. But the one to talk about is Adam Driver who plays the emotionally corrupt villain Kylo Ren, who comes across so stellar that in his character's desires to become the next Darth Vader, you actually wish he was as he nails the Star Wars villain with humor and class as good as any before him.
So in terms of craft and breaking down the filmmaking elements of ""The Force Awakens,"" this movie has it all. But if those elements are in just a simple, safe story that you wish would go to the next level, then it's just promise. But you put those elements in a daring story, it's extraordinary. 
Unfortunately, it strays in the prior and stays safe. Without judging the performances, the new characters of Rey, Kylo and Finn are intriguing, but are nothing new. Furthermore where they take these characters, which could've been interesting to any inventive writer, they instead put in them in the default Star Wars character setting in the same-old story-verse we've seen and heard many times before. Now, the default setting isn't a bad thing, it's just that's what's keeping Episode 7 from being extraordinary.
Now about the title. This installment delves into a concept that is referred to in the title as ""The Force Awakens."" Intriguing and relevant to the new trilogy. But as much as it is true in some ways, it isn't as relevant as it needs to be. In fact, to think about it, when was the Force ever Awakening, and when you really think about, there are only really 1 or 2 moments in the grand scale of the journey that makes this relevant in any way.
The story actually focuses more on the search for Luke Skywalker, which in retrospect gives more sense to Episode 7 being titled ""The Last Jedi,"" or even ""Search for the Last Jedi."" But, shouldn't it be exploring its own new fresh awakening, which is why its called Force Awakens in the first place? 
Yes, and that is where this movie is flawed. 
Not saying this movie doesn't go anywhere, it certainly does especially in the last act of the film. Its just for a good portion of this episode, we're left waiting in anxiety and we start to force our own awakening and wonder upon this movie in hopes it'll create some of it's own. It eventually does, but the line from the Yoda-like character referred to as Maz says, ""a different question for a different time,"" completely defines this movie.
Then until its final breathes, do we realize this may just be where the story really gets going. But it ends right there. Sure, it was a fun ride, but there were so much unfulfilled desires and hopes in the story and characters, other than the craftsmanship, there's really no reason to revisit Force Awakens other than getting giddy about a few promises that are soon to come, in sequels ahead.
Yes, I am going overboard with the criticism here. But there was potential to take this installment in a direction that could've been extraordinary and new. The filmmaking was there, the performances were all there, but I feel as though the production was too in awe that they were making a Star Wars movie, and gave us something fun that pays too much omage. But that doesn't mean it isn't an exhilarating voyage into a galaxy far, far away.
Its exuberant, fresh and has moments with awe that slice you right through the heart. Yes, it has its flaws, but every Star Wars movie does
In the end of the day, this is a fine addition to an already celebrated and unprecedented saga that only brushes the surface, but brushes it in the most exciting way imaginable and leaves us a lot to look forward to. May the Force Be With You!"
" A promising start to the Sequel Trilogy
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,8,"After waiting so long to see a new Star Wars movie, and facing the lemons from the Prequel Trilogy, I came into this movie with some trepidation. Thankfully JJ Abrams handled it well, and the result, while not great, is a good movie that reintroduces us to a galaxy far, far away, shows us how it has changed over the several decades since Return of the Jedi, and leaves us looking forward to its sequel. (How that worked out, you'll have to read in my view of The Last Jedi).The Good:1. New heroes - I liked Rey, Finn and Poe, all of whom are likeable and engage well with each other and the audience. They don't quite have the chemistry of Han, Luke and Leia of A New Hope, but that was almost unique in film history and I wouldn't expect it to be recreated on demand by different actors in a different era. We are also left keen on finding out who Rey really is, what she is doing in exile, and how she has such tremendous potential with the force. 2. New villains - Kylo Ren is an interesting villain in that he starts off a troubled youth doing a poor impersonation of Darth Vader, but then reveals himself to be a genuine villain in this own right as well as a serious threat to the galaxy at large. Snoke is intriguing as a bigger bad behind Kylo Ren, and certainly we are left curious to know who he is, why he is so powerful, and his connection to the larger Star Wars legendarium. 3. Old heros - Seeing Han Solo and Chewbacca on the big screen with the Millennium Falcon (a character in its own right, to my mind) hit all the right spots in a very satisfying serving of nostalgia. That said, I was not expecting that Han would meet his fate in this movie, and the scene in which he does was truly shocking. How can we have lost the coolest guy in the galaxy? It greatly raised the emotional and dramatic stakes of the movie and left me hating and fearing Kylo Ren as the new Darth Vader, as it was meant to. Seeing Princess Leia on the big screen as an older and wiser princess who is less of a hip-shooter than before is also satisfying, even if she doesn't have a good deal of screen time this time around. And the final scene with Luke and Rey at the very end of the movie is beautiful, and left me eager to see more. 4. Visuals - stunning and yet bringing us back to the gritty realism of the original Star Wars. This again feels like a real, lived-in universe. The Indifferent - 1. Blowing up Starkiller Base at the end - it was exciting but all the same, too derivative of A New Hope as so many people have correctly said. My actual thought when seeing this in the theatre was ""I hope no future Star Wars movies involve blowing up the Death Star or its equivalent."" The Bad - 1. I can't think of anything really bad about this movie, but that said nothing in it quite elevates it from the ranks of good to great - although the scene between Han Solo and Kylo Ren comes very close. It is more of a promising start meant to set-up what follows. In conclusion, JJ Abrams handles this movie competently and gets the Sequel Trilogy off to a good start. Hopefully he can carry this promise forward when he takes back the director's chair for Episode IX."
" The Force goes all PC
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,6,"The Empire is replaced by ""The First Order"" as the main enemy of the Rebels. A former stormtrooper and a lonely farmgirl will try to save the day.The 7th installment of the Star Wars franchise moves along at a reasonably brisk pace but it's mostly ""seen that been there"" with a heavy dose of political correctness.It's rather obvious the First order are the Nazis, there is even a Hitlerlike thunderspeech delivered by one of the leaders to endless rows of Stormtroopers.
The rebels are then this multicultural bunch of dogooders. The main charcter is this young girl with no background who becomes this superwarrior without any previous knowledge or training. This character seems to have been inspired by Joan of Arc/maid of Orléans, who was a very young girl, divinely inspired and turned into supreme fighter and leader, leading the French to victory against the invading Brits. Anyway : she is mightily annoying. Joan of Arc was burned by the Brits at the stake which could be an idea for a next episode.The ex-stormtrooper is from Nigeria : Hollywood is now in full PC mode so there you have it. Nice guy and a bit funny sometimes.The whole plot is cutandpaste from the original StarWars so no surprises there. Again :special effects are Ok and it's worth to see it on the big screen.But the PC-ness almost kills of the movie, definitely for the older generation fans. But the new generation, not so familair with the original trilogy, will undoubtedly like it very much."
" In a universe where the previous movies never happened...
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,5,"Wanted to watch this again before (maybe seeing) the last jedi.
Regarding this film: it is as if the Whole Star Wars saga never happened. 
Same plots, same basic roles, and a few new bad guys (one a very emotional and out of control main character, think Anakin on a very bad day)
Another, larger Death Star. 
And no one in the Entire universe seems the least bit worried about the New Order building a planet size death star aimed right at them, or it consuming a sun.
Really??? The old one blew up Alderan and had hyperspace abilities. But nope, only ""a handful of rebels"" are worried. The rest of the galaxy just sits facing down the barrel of a huge gun, apparently surprised at their own deaths. 
The New Order is the Empire, which of course is not very bright either. 
Solo is back to smuggling and lost track of the only thing he seems to value more then Chewy. 
Again, as if none of the previous movies ever happened, from Death Stars to overcoming the Empire, to Luke himself (who apparently has locked himself away).
And the new heroine, Rey, wow. Not sure what she is, but she is a woman who can do absolutely everything and anything, mechanical, Force based, saber fighting. 
Of course, how she does this all is a huge question a she seems to be a scavenger on a lonely, dusty planet. No training, education, just surviving. But she know it all. 
As for Jedi and training, she does not need any of it. Perhaps she is ""all force""."
" An average Star Wars movie
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,7,"While doing her routine search for items which will bring her daily dose of food, Rey saves a tiny droid which is in need of even more help. Carrying an important piece of information, it must be taken urgently to the rebels. Together with a new friend, she'll have to face many adventures until the BB-8 completes its quest before the First Order gets its hands on him.This instalment of the Star Wars franchise has its story set in a time where The First Order has only the last hiding forces of the rebels to defeat before taking complete control. Young Rey is introduced into the story, along with her special abilities, who will prove to be a key factor in what is to come. We follow her, throughout many perils, full of captivating CGI and action sequences, typical to the series. Unfortunately, these are the main pluses of the movie, and not the same can be said about the story and the characters. Many are annoying or simply stupid, without a clear idea of their role, contributing one way or another to a story which simply doesn't provide something truly great. It is just OK, not very predictable but also not very complex, doing its job but nothing more. I found it to be quite an average film, with only a couple of characters which are pleasant and dignified to be watched, bringing some substance to an average story which also contains characters which simply shouldn't exist, which have a tendency of getting on your nerves more than being useful. Besides this problems, if you look closer, you can still find some good aspects which ultimately transform this movie into a rather good watch. It still looks great, has plenty of action, and at least two or three good characters which somehow make up to the other disappointments.Overall, I found an average movie, which definitely could have been a lot better, but it simply fell into mediocrity due to a lack of story complexity and character development. I'm pretty sure that the series' fans will be disappointed with it, but for me it was somewhat OK."
" A soon-to-be-classic entry in the greatest film series of all time!
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"It's finally here - something that some fans have been waiting 32 years for! (Although the last theatrically-released Star Wars film, 'The Clone Wars', only came out seven years ago). Since I wasn't born until after 'Return of the Jedi' and grew up watching them on VHS and am a pretty big fan, the sequel trilogy (as opposed to the prequel trilogy) and 'The Force Awakens' has long been hoped for.OK, let's see if I can do a vague storyline with no spoilers... 30 years after the Battle of Endor, Han (Ford) is the first 'original' we're reintroduced to - well, technically Stormtroopers are, followed by the Millennium Falcon. But first, we meet Poe (Issac), an X-Wing pilot for ""the Resistance"" (the new Rebel Alliance); BB8, a ball-like droid; Finn (Boyega), a former Stormtrooper; and Rey (Ridley), a scavenger, barely surviving on the desert world of Jakku (which plays a role in the 'Lost Stars' novel, well worth a read!). BB8 holds some important data and needs to get it to Leia (Fisher), before the ""First Order"" (the new Empire) and Kylo Ren (Driver) get it, so they can all find Luke (Hamill). The only ones missing are Lando & Wedge.It feels like a lot has changed, but also not much at all - it truly feels like the original Star Wars universe, with plenty of new aliens, spaceships and droids, but also plenty of old ones. Abrams has definitely nailed the tone, with plenty of adventure and zest, and also some humour and drama. The pace rarely sags and it doesn't feel like two & a bit hours, but nor does it try to cram too much in. It's not exactly a carbon copy of 'A New Hope', but definitely borrows a lot of themes from it.Some questions are answered, but are lot are left unanswered, so the anticipation remains for the next films. While the film is definitely a great movie - and far better than any of the prequels - I sometimes didn't feel as if as much was at stake as it was in the originals and a few things didn't sit 100% right, also probably a by-product of my high expectations. Still, Ridley & Boyega are both very good to watch and valuable additions, and Driver's intriguing - I look forward to watching their characters grow in Episodes VIII and IX."
" I love Star Wars...
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,1,"...but I hate this movie... no creativity at all... playing it safe sucks, Disney."
" Not the worst film, but......
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,6,"I'll try to make this review quick.The Good: 
Good effects and visualsFairly solid storyA couple of interesting scenes (Ren stops a blaster bolt, Ren reads minds)A couple of interesting characters (Kylo, Poe)Sets the stage for some potentially interesting developments in the next installment. The Bad:
Unoriginal, rehashed story. This is ""A New Hope: The Remix"".Little character development.Character personalities are inconsistent. Is Fin a jokey millennial or a serious defector struggling with the past?Ideological inconsistencies. Fin doesn't like war and killing, yet kills storm troopers whom he once worked with.Mary Sue. Rey starts as an interesting character, but quickly becomes boring when we realize that she's good at everything.Star Wars mythological inconsistencies. Apparently, any one can become a Jedi with literally no training, and go toe-to-toe with a trained Sith.Wasted characters (Phasma)Marvel Universe style script. Star Wars has maintained a certain speaking style throughout the saga, and this film shoots for a modern, millennial style that is completely out of place in the franchise.Comedic vibe. There is little or no seriousness to the film; everything is a joke.There are other things I didn't care for, but that would take all day to get in to. The film is better production-wise than Episode 2, and far less cringe worthy, but I think the prequels in general still maintained the heart and soul of Star Wars, despite their shortfalls. This film, however, feels more like a Star Trek film more than Star Wars; a little too much Sci-fi, not enough fantasy."
" this movie is a joke
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,1,"This movie is an exact copy of episode 4, a new hope... but much, much worst. i really can't understand how people rate this movie so high... it's so patetic!"
" A disappointing addition to the Star Wars universe
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,1,"Star Wars The Force Awakens was disappointing. The actors were terrible. Rey and Finn do NOT do justice to thier roles. The stormtroopers' fighting was mediocre. Kylo Ren taking his mask off revealed his ""cute"" face, thus not making the first order seem evil. What was the directer thinking when he did this? Finally, this film copies Star Wars IV too much, making it lack creativity. I would not recommend this film to anyone, as it is a disaster. 0/10"
" Disney Begins.... Trolling Star Wars' Fans
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,1,"This is the beginning installment in Disney Corporation trolling Star Wars fans, stealing from the deluded and pickpocketing the weak-minded.In releasing this with bean counter clerk JJ Abrams as director (of treasury department) Disney is telling the world that we are the weak-minded troopers who can be tricked by a wave of a hand. Except the Disney hos are not jedi. They are sith.Show me anything original, creative, imaginative or in keeping with the Star Wars lore in this film and I will show you an honest Disney board of directors' member."
" Disappointment in every respect
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,1,"Unimpressive and inexplicable characters, weird action turns, and little respect for the original Star Wars universe. Great visuals is not what makes a Star Wars movie. You might put a Van Damme into a Shrek story - he'll surely be fun, but he'll be pointless. And that is the problem here. Obviously the people who made this sory piece did not love or did not understand Star Wars."
" Recycled, nostalgic, and not half bad
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"JJ Abrams is really good at this: recycle the plot, reconfigure the characters and let the action take center stage. It is a simple formula, and it mostly works here. Despite basically being a remake of the first Star Wars - from the plot to the characters - this story feels fresh and fun most of the time. Part of that's performances, but most of it is Abrams' sense of pace: more action, less trade policy. The flaws from the original trilogy are all here, especially the plot holes. But it is hard to notice them when you are having fun reliving the movies of your youth. There are some eye rolls, but I'll take this over the prequels any day."
" The worst piece of flaming garbage ever made
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,1,"Hard to find anything positive to say about this garbage pile of a movie that was lit on fire and fed healthy amount of garbage to keep it burning for its entire duration. I actually thought it wasnt that bad for the first 50 minutes, but whatever little hope i had was completely crushed and soiled by the time this disgraceful piece of filth was over. 
 
 The only thing you can think is how much i wish Lucas had made the movie with the advances in technology up to this point. The acting, the writing, the story, the characters, every aspect of this film is so horrible that its actually disturbing. It leaves you haunted by how bad it was and looking for revenge against all the criminals that made it happen.  I dont want to give anything away but theres not a single perspective of this film that makes it good. Lets face it, the only great Star Wars films are the ones Lucas made, and the first three episodes, especially Revenge of The Sith, was the best Star Wars films ever made. The fact that professional critics rate this movie so highly but the first three episodes so poorly, is unequivocal proof that the job of film critic is just some made up profession comprised of pretentious miserable nitwits who are being paid to corrupt the minds of those who need others to think for them. Rotten Tomatoes is not a site that infers movies are rotten, just the idiots who write the reviews. Dont waste your time with this garbage, go pop in the first three episodes and go on a thrilling ride, the way Lucas intended his series, by the time Revenge Of The Sith is over, you'll have enjoyed wasting precious time in your life watching Star Wars movies."
" disgrace
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,1,"Action scenes is a fundamental part of all starwars movies, but making a sith loose a fight against a stormtrooper(who fights bad enough to loose a fight another stormtrooper proving no force whatsoever) is just making the movie like a gma tomato"
" Who cares?!?!
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,2,"How may ways is TLJ awful? Let's count the ways:For starters, it has three subplots (Rey's training under Skywalker, Finn's attempt to find a codebreaker, and Poe's attempt to save the Rebel fleet). With three sub plots going on at once, it's hard to follow and remain emotionally engaged. By the time you come back to Poe's training, for example, so much has already happened you don't even know if it matters. I took a bathroom break and felt like it was easier to follow the action when I returned.Next, no original technology. It's all just stuff from the first two trilogies. The Phantom menace had some interesting toys (such as pod racers) and the Empire Strikes back a fantastic action sequence (a free falling Millennium Falcon navigating an asteroid field) and turtle Walker that was unrealistic as hell, but cool, but in this derivative junk, nothing to get excited about. Truth be told, Carrie Fisher was never the strongest character in the original trilogy who usually spent her time complaining that she wasn't being treated like a princess enough or waiting to be rescued. Making her the star general getting nearly everyone killed by being so a willy nilly didn't make her especially fun to watch. It's like driving on the freeway with your grandmother. Oh, wait, TWO grandmothers!Rey as a Mary Sue is sometimes likable about about as interesting as Luke Skywalker in the original trilogy. Consider Darth Vader in the original trilogy: He had a dark sense of humor (pardon the pun) while Kylo seems to just need a diaper change. The bad guy First Order types are just nasty, angry jerks while in the original empire, they were cool and collected while going about their evil duties. This film reminds me a lot like Battlefield Earth but at least Battlefield Earth had action. It didn't stay stale for too long and the bad acting and writing actually was kind of funny. When bad acting and writing isn't funny, or compelling, you just get something like the drivers ed videos you sat through in high school. (At least those were educational.)Finally, with the rebellion being so ineffective or even much more likable than the First Order it begs the question: Who cares? Who cares if the rebellion just gets blown up? Apparently, the rest of the galaxy doesn't seem to care and neither did I until these 3 tired stories wound their won their way out much like the popcorn out of my colon."
" Rating: A
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,9,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017) was just released, but my time didn't yet allow me to watch it. However, I do have time to review the film that started this new trilogy: The Force Awakens. At the time, it was my most anticipated movie of the year and I placed it second on the list of my favorite films of 2015 (just a bit below Mad Max: Fury Road).So, yes, I do love this movie and it is definitely on the top3 of the saga! The cast choices are the undoubtful proof of the huge success that this film achieved. Daisy Ridley (Rey) is a massive discovery, her talent is limitless and she embraces her role like no other. She delivers a very emotional and powerful display, showing all of her acting skills. I can feel that she is 100% committed to her character and what a character to portray at your first big movie appearance.Rey is excellently-developed throughout the film, she might mislead people into thinking she is just a mere scavenger, but once the movie gets going, she becomes an awesome character sharing some of the most epic moments in the whole runtime. She has an oddly mysterious backstory, which is going to produce theories and plot twists that I can't wait for, in the next films.John Boyega (Finn) is a fantastic supporting actor and another great casting. He brings just the right amount of humor with some exceptionally delivered lines and his facial expressions and timing are perfect. Finn is going to be one of the audience's favorites for sure, his journey to encounter Rey is interesting and unique in the saga. In my opinion, it is his story that carries the beginning of the movie and that sets up a lot of characters and plot points.Adam Driver as Kylo Ren ... Oh. My. God. What a performance! Driver is so subtle in the most meaningful moments but so compelling in the most menacing ones. He elevates Ren into a phenomenal antagonist with a splendidly written script. J.J. Abrams and co. do a wonderful job writing both the plot and the characters. Kylo Ren stands out, he is a multi-layered character with so much untold and hidden behind his personality and intriguing past. Once again, there are many theories and plot twists ahead that I'm drooling to know which one they are going to follow with.Oscar Isaac is very exciting as Poe Dameron, another fabulous addition to the franchise. His character creates an honest bond with Finn and their interactions are pretty cool. They share some amazing scenes and Poe has all of the awesome X-Wing fights, which are outstanding. Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) does not show up that much, but he definitely is a very threatening presence and a very well achieved motion capture work.As for the original cast/characters, Harrison Ford has one of his best performances in the more recent years. Han Solo is one of his most popular characters and he portrays him flawlessly. Carrie Fisher returns as Leia and she offers a touch of reality to all of this. Every time she is on screen, everything becomes more realistic and tangible due to her graceful and humble display. Chewbacca has the usual funny ""dialogues"" with Solo and some glorious action set pieces.BB-8 is what people feared the most since he could easily be annoying or irrelevant. Thankfully, he is another checkbox on the list of marvelous additions to the Star Wars universe. It is mind-blowing how a droid can provide so much laughter and terrific action scenes, he is unquestionably a toy worth spending your money on for Christmas. C-3PO also appears and elevates the level of nostalgia that everyone is already full of.Moving to the technical aspects of the film, J.J. Abrams proves himself to every single person that doubted him since he is the main reason why this movie is one of the greats. From the seamless editing to the great camera work during the impressive action sequences, he enhances the story so much with his distinct use of visual storytelling. It feels like a real film and not just a Star Wars typical movie.The visual effects are top notch and the cinematography could not be better due to the unbelievable practical backgrounds. Abrams uses a lot of long, wide shots with beautiful landscapes and mostly everything is real (besides the obvious, there is very few CGI, less than you probably think), which transforms every scene, every shot, into something more special. The tone is very well balanced between comedy and action, the storytelling process is astonishingly well handled and the pacing always maintains the tremendous excitement.One of the common issues of all Star Wars films are the excessive exposition scenes. Well, J.J. massively improves on that aspect having just a couple of them and I am counting the traditional text that starts the movie. Like I said above, there is an extensive use of visual storytelling, in other words, everything that you see is giving you information while advancing the plot without actually literally telling you what is going on or what is going to happen.John Williams' score continues to superbly accompany every scene, not only the action ones, but it also strengthens dialogues. I love the ending, but here is where both fans and critics are going to become very divisive. It ends with a huge cliffhanger and some people are going to be disappointed because they are left with this feeling of unfulfillment and if you don't know how to deal with it, you might think you didn't enjoy the film.The truth is you can't have everything right now. This is a trilogy, so it is absurd to even expect that you are going to have everything that you wish for in the first movie of a new era. I wanted more from the second the film finished, I also felt a bit let down because the movie concludes with something I had been expecting forever. However, this is a great feeling to have because it means the film meant something, it means the movie was so amazing that I just can't wait anymore for the next one!Nevertheless, The Force Awakens can't escape some minor flaws. While pretty much every single character is great, Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) is not. With so much practical effects surrounding every environment, a 100% CGI character is going to (negatively) standout. Besides, the whole subplot involving meeting with Maz feels a bit unnecessary and the story could have easily progressed without her.However, my main issue with this film is its lack of originality when it comes to creating a new actual danger for the galaxy. I mean, the Starkiller Base is essentially another Death Star, just bigger ... Really? They couldn't figure out anything else besides another giant planet destroyer? It does not reflect J.J. Abrams' incredible direction and the production team's excellent work, at all.Finally, there are some ""problems"" that I don't yet know if they are, in fact, problems. This is the first movie of the trilogy and some things happened that I don't know how or why they did, so I can't really fault the screenplay ... yet. We all know the huge plot device that Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) supposedly had for decades, but then Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) was released and brilliantly solved what was already considered an internet meme.This film does not have such a massive plot device, but there is one little moment that occurs in the first act that I still don't know if it is, in fact, a flaw or if there is an explanation waiting for us in the next movies.All in all, The Force Awakens proves that the Star Wars franchise is still, very much, alive! This is easily one of the best films of 2015 and one of the best in the franchise. It features an outstanding cast with some excellent performances from the new actors joining the saga and powerfully nostalgic displays from the original members. Incredibly-developed characters carry this movie with the help of a mysterious and captivating screenplay, as well as a lot of visually exciting action sequences. J.J. Abrams has his stamp all over the film, with beautiful wide shots, massive practical effects, and exceptional use of visual storytelling. A cheap third Death Star and some very minor issues here and there don't allow the movie to shine flawlessly, but it is still freaking awesome! It undoubtedly belongs to my Top3, behind Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope."

" Bringing back Star Wars !!!
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,7,"There is a moment towards the middle of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' when Han Solo says the following to Rey and Finn - ""It's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true."" - that particular line of dialogue to me completely and very clearly established and underlines the motive and the intent of JJ Abrams and Disney as a whole behind their collective approach in restarting the Star Wars Saga. Since the souring of the mood and the spirits of the diehard Star Wars fans triggered by the prequels, there had been a prolonged gap. The basic idea of 'The Force Awakens' is to end that gap by reaffirming the myths, the legends and the magic of Star Wars and reassure the fanbase with a film that symbolises the phrase - 'Star Wars(in its original form) is back !!!'
To me this idea of reaffirming the legend of 'Star Wars' has two repercussions which are very noticeable in the film. On one hand, certain elements that make the original trilogy wondrous like the joy and innocence of fantasies and adventures, Han Solo's charisma, etc. On the other hand, it also brings along with it the elements that have always prevented me from fully embracing Star Wars which are surface level storytelling, hokey and over-expressive dialogue,etc. Another problem with the film is that in trying to deliver on 'fan service', the film doubles down and flirts with the prospect of being a little over-abundant on references and moments that pay explicit homage to the original trilogy as well as overall narrative throughlines that again blatantly mirror a number of the occurrences in previous films in the series.
However what prevents the film from becoming an excuse in nostalgia porn is the characters. The new characters especially Rey and Finn were very likeable and they seem like individuals that I as a viewer would like to accompany in future adventures and spend time with. I mentioned earlier how 'Force Awakens' reaffirms the myths of Star Wars. Through Daisy Ridley's 'Rey', the film goes one step forward by hinting at powers and abilities which are unprecedented and almost incomprehensible(to Rey herself), the sources of which will probably be elaborated upon in the sequels. Harrison Ford manages to embody the swashbuckling Han Solo once again after all these years and it feels like older version of the exact same character from the original trilogy with the same charisma and sarcasm. Kylo Ren seemed interesting enough.
In an nutshell the film embodies certain elements that I have never completely been in tune with which are inherent to the concept of Star Wars itself. But having said that, with the basic energy and the exciting new characters, JJ Abrams managed to make me not only care about about this film, but also curious about what's to come next."
" A remake
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,7,This film was visually stunning. However I feel it was simply a remake of episode IV: A New Hope with a subplot attached. I was and still am disappointed with the way this movie turned
" Perfect Follow Up
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,9,This movie was amazing it is the perfect follow up to the original trilogy. the writing and acting was perfect along with the special effects. it is great to see old characters return as well as meet brand new characters. this movie is a must for true Star Wars fans.
" A game of galactic roulette with product placement
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,1,"Droid with vital information coincidentally found by Force user girl on planet and saved from destruction. (Coincidence No. 1) Of all the First Order soldiers in the Galaxy, the one that suddenly has a change of heart (Finn) is on the ship where owner of droid (Poe) is taken for interrogation, and this is the exact moment he has this unlikely change of heart, even though he must have seen quite a lot of ugly stuff already, and also used to work as a janitor (seriously?) on mega-superweapon Starkiller Base. Oh, and Finn, who seems to be a cautious guy, chooses the most idiotic method of deserting the First Order's ranks: he gets in a Tie fighter with Poe, hoping to escape, even though he knows they would likely be shot, INSTEAD OF delaying his desertation just a little bit, until they land somewhere and he could arrange his disappearance in a battle or with some outside help. No, he wants to do it right here and right now. (Coincidence No. 2, although this is actually a combination of unlikely coincidences, Implausible Behavior No. 1). After they land and Finn leaves the scene, he meets Force user supergirl (Rey) by sheer chance. Rey could be at home, or out scavenging, it's not as if she spends her entire day in the settlement. Also, if Finn is trying to get away from imperials, why on earth does he head for the settlement when he knows that's where the First Order are most likely to look for him? (Coincidence No. 3) Soon enough, the First Order guys find them and start shooting them with laser cannons from fighters whoosing up and down above the settlement. If they really need the information in the droid, isn't that a bit of a risk to take? Why alert their prey and why not wait a bit and send a large landing force to surround the settlement? Why shoot with laser cannons when the droid could be hit and the information destroyed? Just for fun? (Implausible Behavior No. 2) So Finn and Rey are on the run now, and guess what they find conveniently lying there in the desert just a few hundred meters away: the friggin' Millenium Falcon! Of all the places in the Galaxy, the Falcon is on the planet where super Force user girl lives, Luke's friend with the vital information lives, and where an indoctrinated First Order soldier decides to finally break ties with the evil First Order. (Coincidence No. 4, or we could call it Product Placement No. 1, the product being Star Wars nostalgia) Okay, so it's only natural then, that after they successfully escape with the Falcon, they are captured or found by none other than... oh, yes, I can feel the Force in action now, it really awakened, didn't it... Han Solo and Chewbakka, who else? Everyone is here for a party, it seems. Okay, the ship does have a beacon, and they find it via the beacon signal, but as they clearly state: ""Just lucky we were in the general vicinity when the ship powered up and its beacon snapped on."" Yeah, just lucky I guess. Of all the places in the known Galaxy, they were in the general vicinity. (Coincidence No. 5) And this is the exact moment when two rival gangs arrive to settle debts with Han. They did not find them by tracking the Falcon (in that case, this would make sense, as the Falcon's beacon has just been turned on), but by tracking the freighter. So the exact moment when Han finds the Falcon, the gangs arrive with guns blazing. (Coincidence No. 6) They have to escape in the Falcon, to a planet called Takodana, where Maz Kanata lives. And guess what this female wannabe Yoda happens to have lying around in her basement? Hmm? Noone? Friggin' Luke Skywalker's lightsaber, that's what! Of all the places in the Galaxy, our team of adventurers happened to wind up in the cantina where also Luke's lightsaber is kept. By Maz Katana, who sympathizes with the Resistance, yet has somehow failed to mention this so far to anyone at the Resistance, even though she must have known they are actively looking for the lost Jedi. (Coincidence No. 7, Implausible Behavior No. 3)
And this is just the first quarter of the movie, and just the most embarrassing stuff. It's not a story, it's intergalactic roulette. Coincidences abound, irrational behavior is the new norm, product placement rules supreme. Oh, and did I mention the new superweapon, Starkiller Base can destroy multiple planets or whole systems ANYWHERE in the galaxy? I understand they wanted to up the ante, but seriously? How are they going to raise the stakes next? Galaxy-destroying thermal detonators? Uber-Jedi with the ability to destroy the entire universe with a flick of the wrist? No, thank you. They have lost sense of measure in the attempt to impress the audience, using the characters as disposable plot elements in a game of galactic roulette. Logical, character-based story arcs are a thing of the past. I could go on, but there's no point really. Money seems to be flowing in for Disney, so why should they care? Lucas referred to the SW movies as his kids, and added: ""I sold them to the white slavers that takes these things, and...,"" Then he laughed and decided it's better not to finish this sentence..."
" Better than I remember
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,7,"The first time I watched this I thought it was the worst in the saga but now on rewatch I find it the best after the original trilogy. This is the only Star Wars film until that point, including the original trilogy, in which I didn't cringe at a dialogue or acting at some point of the film. The set up of all the new characters and the world is so perfect while giving enough importance to the old characters just enough."

" Primitive, boring, predictable
",2017-12-19 00:00:00,1,"Little sense, which is being attempted to be compensated by massive special effects. Watching this movie I got impression like I've seen it already and could easily predict not only what is going to happen next, but also a race of each character as well as order of appearance just to follow the rules of racial equality.
The main personage of an ""evil man"" again predictably chosen a white guy.
I could see a hidden message, created by this move ""white man is still good, but his time is over"". 
It looked like creators of this movie were more concerned about racial complains and racial relationships, rather making this movie having more spiritual sense.

" Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie review
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,9,"With the upcoming release of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" i've decided to make a review of this movie.
""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is a movie directed by J.J. Abrams and stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Harrison Ford, and many more. This movie takes place after ""Return of the jedi"" back in 1983 and is about the resistance has to complete a very important mission for the destiny of the galaxy and the first order has to stop it. 
Let's talk about the positive things, the visual effects are fantastic. J.J. is a director that is known for his ability to combine the CGI effects and the practical ones at just the right level, and it shows. By the way this is a very well directed movie and very well edited too. All this together with John Williams's score, you do feel like Star Wars is more than back into the big screen.
The performances in this movie are some of the best of the entire saga with out a dude. John Boyega as Finn is fantastic and Daisy Ridley is magnificent as Rey. She is easily the best part of this movie. Adam Driver was awesome as Kylo Ren, one of the best movie villains in recent years. Harrison Ford as Han Solo is very good, and the friendship between Han and Chewie still there and is very fresh.
This is a very funny movie, in my opinion this is the funniest movie of the entire saga. And almost all the comedy comes from BB-8, which is awesome and i loved it in this film.
""Episode VII"" has some very good battle sequences and the sound mixing was great, you feel the action almost directly in your face and is awesome to see.
The easter eggs and references to the other Star Wars movies were also great, and there are shown with respect to the saga and the fans of the source material. I like the fact that the references there are not in the entire movie, which i'm very happy. Because this movie had a danger to doing that like ""Jurassic World"" did it that year, but thanks to the force, that didn't happened.
I loved this movie,but it does have some flaws. For example, Snoke and Maz Kanata. This movie has this two CGI characters here, but they don't matter all that much. There are scenes when we see Snoke talking to some people and is not that interesting or important. The same thing happened with Maz, she was and old lady who sometimes talks about other Star Wars things, but is not interesting. But, don't worry, there are not in the entire movie.
This movie is one for my favorites movies of Star Wars and it is i the 4th place in my ranking of the Star Wars movies. I've already watched ""The Last Jedi"" and is amazing, but I need to watch it a second time before i do the review. Those are my thoughts of ""Star Wars: Episode VII"" and thats way i'm going to give it a 9/10."
" A weak attempt to reboot Star Wars
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,1,"Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens sees young Rey (Ridley) meeting former stormtrooper Finn (Boyega), they find the Millennium Falcon and flee while pursued by the First Order. They find Han Solo (Ford) and join the Rebels in an effort to thwart the Order.Force Awakens had the potential to be the best Star Wars film since Empire if done right. Unfortunately it was placed in the hands of J.J. Abrams.
It's nearly a copy of A New Hope. Even being bold enough to just use the exact same dialogue. Perhaps Abrams thought that was clever. But it wasn't, it makes the film feel cheap and lazy.The effects are bad, the performances are forgettable.
The new characters are bad. Rey is dull, undeveloped and forgettable.
Finn is annoying, pointless and he tries way to often to be funny but he's not.
Kylo Ren is the worst villain yet, he's whiny, not at all threatening and just overall unlikable in every way.
Actors like Isaac, Christie, Gleeson, Serkis and Nyongo are barely there and play completely undeveloped characters.So basically if you'd like to watch a CGI-filled undeveloped rip-off of A New Hope then have at it.
But for people like me. We'll never understand how this crap has a spot IMDb's top 250 list."
" Worthy
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,7,They started again with new characters while blending in the originals. But it felt too fast paced at times.Watched it 4 or 5 times now. It's better than most of the prequel SW films but like I thought originally - it was a lazy/Disney effort.Despite my grumbles I'm giving it a 7 out of 10 - mostly because there was more right with it than wrong.
" I'd give this a 10 if it weren't for ""A New Hope""
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,7,"I'd have to admit, if this were a standalone film it would be fantastic, because JJ Abrams and his new crew of Star Wars makers did a really good job. However, I have no idea why, but for some reason he and Lawrence Kasdan decided to steal most if not all the aspects of ""A New Hope"" into this new storyline that would either make or break Disney's reputation for how well they can handle Star Wars.So here's my basic analysis of this movie compared to Episode IV (minor spoilers, if you don't want to read ahead).How the plot lines up with Episode IV
Stormtroopers, plus a Sith Lord who wears a mask that digitizes his voice, attack the good guys because they have valuable information, and one of the good guys sends off a droid with that information before getting captured.That droid with the valuable information comes across the lead protagonist, on a sandy planet, who later discovers Jedi powers.The stormtroopers find the droid with its Jedi partner, but then they escape in the Millennium Falcon (which the Jedi character regards as trashy).The bad guys have their headquarters on a gigantic fortress that has a cannon that can destroy entire planets.The new Jedi character comes across Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber.The new Jedi and friends come across the team of good guys and go to their planet that is moderately forest but somewhat swampy (I'm almost starting to wonder if it's the same planet in both movies), and discuss how to defeat the bad guys' planet-destroying headquarters.The good guys, with their X-Wings and Y-Wings, attack the enemy headquarters as it's preparing to destroy the good guys' headquarters.The Sith Lord manages to escape alive, along with various other members of his team, for the sake of setting up a sequel.Here's other features of Episode IV that were placed in out of order
A stormtrooper rescues one of the bad guys' prisoners (the same prisoner who sent off the droid with the valuable information).The Millennium Falcon gets captured by tractor-beam.Han Solo has an unsettled debt with criminals.The main characters enter a cantina, where the gad buys have a spy who notices the droid with the valuable information (which later leads to a battle) , and one of the main characters pays someone for transportation.The main characters manually go in to disable the bad guys' fortress' shield.A old, mentor character is killed by the Sith Lord.Now on the positive side, let me mention some original material (or at the very least, material that makes this plot unique) that this movie had.
The new Sith's lightsaber - it not only has the laser hilts, but the saber itself seems to have a different texture to it than most lightsabers.For some reason, none of the Sith are called ""Darth"".New force powers were introduced (such as force freeze and force faint), however I'm not too sure whether that's a plus for this movie.The leading character is female (all the previous Star Wars movies have had male characters), and she lives as a scavenger.A stormtrooper, out of his own conscience, chooses to betray the bad guys; this clearly shows actual personality to them as opposed to the previous Star Wars films, which depicts them as merely expendable objects.The new Jedi is able to discover that she is a Jedi all on her own; in Luke's and Anakin's cases, they needed another Jedi master to tell them that they were Jedi.The second-to-last fight scene is perhaps the most original Star Wars battle to date (the one on the green planet where that cantina is).A non-Jedi wields a lightsaber to fight the bad guys (Han Solo in E. V never fought stormtroopers with Luke's lightsaber, and General Grievous in E. III was already a bad guy).A stormtrooper wields a melee weapon, though this does somewhat compare to the Magnaguards in E. III.The Sith takes off his mask to show how ordinary he is (however, people initially laughed at his non-masked appearance).The Jedi=Sith battle at the end showed that neither side had too much experience with lightsabers.The valuable information contained by the droid isn't about defeating the bad guys, but it sets up the sequel.The only reason why everyone has been rating this film 1-5 is because of how much of a remake of E. IV this is. I can totally understand their disappointment, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the movie itself was bad. I do agree that I was a little dumbfounded to see that this movie was too exact to E. IV, but I do still think that this movie was good enough to set a good reputation for Disney occupying Star Wars (you can at least admit that this movie was better than the prequels, right?).
Like I said before, this is the only reason why I am rating this a 7; otherwise, I would have rated it a 10."
" Storytelling is not about telling a new story...
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,9,"It's great if you can tell a fresh story every time, but most of the stories that haven't yet been told aren't that great. This film has come under a lot of criticism by people who fundamentally don't understand storytelling. One of the biggest critiques is that it's just a rehash of A New Hope. And that's true. It's the exact same story. But told better.
It's a better introduction to the universe. While the originals all hold a special place in my heart, they aren't friendly to new viewers. You have to be trained to love Star Wars from very young with these older films, because they really don't withstand the test of time. However, this installment does. Because all of the characters are so enjoyable, Han's death is sadder, Rey's victory is sweeter, and Finn's injury is more tense. In New Hope, I didn't find myself caring so much about the characters, and while probably very intense for its time, the dry performances now make it a lot less high stakes. The Force Awakens is the kind of movie that will have you on the edge of your seat; none of the other movies really are.
Ultimately, this movie is A New Hope, indeed, but on crack. Humor that doesn't fall flat, likable characters, and of course, Daisy Ridley, the most beautiful woman in the galaxy. It reintroduces some of our favorite characters in clever and nostalgic ways, and ultimately, that makes this a nearly perfect introduction to a larger universe. It's not too out there. There isn't anything too new and weird (that comes in the next movie), it's just a good old story that's told better the second time."
" Idiot plot. Unoriginal. Hype, hype, hype.
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,1,"Don't believe the hype. Disney's secret agents are probably busy buying positive reviews to counter the genuine opinions of actual viewers, and 2 billion dollars says they are doing something right - and killing SW in the process.
The problem is not that they ""disrespect"" the SW universe. The SW universe could withstand a lot of new ideas/characters/plot twists, and still stand. New ideas. Creative ideas. But not the idiocy and/or neglicence of writers and directors who know nothing about storytelling or simply don't care enough to come up with a plot that doesn't fall apart in a nanosecond.
It's the fact that they disrespect the intelligence of viewers on a whole new level. Everyone in this movie behaves irrationally, and every ""new"" idea is a rip-off based on old ideas, only executed in an illogical and idiotic fashion, with the single goal of reproducing some supposedly ""great"" moments from the old movies and give the disneyfied audience a reason to cheer in the theater... and forget that movies should actually make some sense.
To be honest, the movie has its moments. Like when it ended, I was quite grateful."
" A good mixture of nostalgia and new
",2017-12-14 00:00:00,8,"Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens focuses on Nostalgia of the original trilogy using elements and aspects from the original trilogy to introduce both old and new characters. The original storyline parts mesh well with borrowed aspects, Disney played safe for sure when making the movie, regardless it came out well. Although some of the new acting choices are questionable, its still an enjoyable beginning of a new trilogy.Both new and old Star Wars fans will enjoy this new addition to the Star Wars universe."
" If the Empire wanted to punish everyone who cheered for rebels, it would have made this movie
",2017-12-13 00:00:00,1,"A very anticipated movie and a huge disappointment.
For a SW fan the pain of watching it is almost physical. Without diving into a detailed review I'll just highlight the moments when it hurt the most: The terrible, ridiculos, miscast face of Ren. Very cheap rebel base. Ren's constant alternation between being all-powerful and very weak. Surprise appearances of characters and their powers. Overall weak plot."
" Very Strong Sequel
",2017-12-13 00:00:00,8,"As I said before, I am not a Star Wars fan but all of these films are very exciting and very entertaining. This one, Force Awakens, is a pretty strong and astonishing eye candy with plot to match and excellent actors' chemistry to binge watching and enjoy.
I need not retell the plot but what I can say, this is a fine element of a bigger mosaic and as a definitive piece it holds well, showing that not only excellent CGI or great vision can create a stunning effect, but also a thoughtful idea, careful approach to depicting baddies, strong twists and very subtle grain of humor add a real lot of greatness and grandeur.
Good movie with Daisy Ridley and Harrison Ford as well as Adam Driver shining great and not allowing te plot to slide into banality or sentimentality.
I await a new episode and hope they will prove more."
" Remove the importance of the Force & Training.... Say goodbye to Star Wars!
",2017-12-13 00:00:00,6,"The biggest problem with Force AwakensWhat I didn't understand was how Rey was able to ""defeat"" Kylo Ren who had more experience and training that she had. In fact, Rey had no experience and was only finding out about the force. Every other Jedi or Sith had to learn the force and they couldn't beat someone that had more experience with the force. For some reason, Rey had already unlocked the power of the force, enough to beat the Sith apprentice (Kylo Ren). It took Luke episode 5 to learn the force but it took Rey 5 minutes. Even with Yoda's training, Luke still couldn't defeat Vader in combat. Vader defeated himself essentially and also defeated Palpatine. The next point was how John Boyega (Finn) was able to wield the lightsaber whilst not being a Jedi or have training. Also being against Kylo Ren should've seen him die in one second. Now I'm not saying you have to be a Jedi to use a lightsaber but in order to use it competently, one must understand the force and be able to wield the force. Han Solo is the only non-jedi that used a lightsaber in the original trilogy but he didn't use it by fighting and deflecting bullets. He used it by simply cutting the ton ton to allow Luke to enter it thereby keeping Luke warm. In Finn's case, he's able to use it in melee which simply cannot happen. Now let's say for some reason Finn is also a Jedi, the problem is he would still require training in the force which he simply didn't have. Jedi's do not get their lightsabers immediately after finding out they are a Jedi so it doesn't make sense. In my opinion, Disney have ripped the soul of Star Wars. The idea that you can be a Jedi with great power without training is killing this franchise. They've ripped the importance of the force out of this movie. Sure it looked good but I expect a movie that spent as much as Force Awakens did to look good. Star Wars fans care more about the storyline and in my opinion it wasn't great."
" Nice wrapping, no substance
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,5,"To be exact this movie is around the 6,5-6,9 depending on if you view it as part of a series (then lower rating due to story) or a standalone flick (then a bit higher). As part of a series and as a standalone it's strengths are the special effects, grandiose delivery, music and star wars feeling from nostalgic elements. The negative in the positive is that even the nostalgic elements feel calculated instead of natural.It's weaknesses are the lack of creative story making, bad acting which is too funny at times, and lack of star wars lore consistency. Also it felt like a feminist manifesto with the main character all the way. She can do everything, better, stronger, without training from sheer being better. It's all her, and don't you dare doubt she can do it. I would just like to remind everyone even Anakin Skywalker (choosen one and whatnot) was not proficient in lightsaber wielding and the force without practice. Even if we just project the moral of what we saw, the message should not be that you can do everything better than others without practice. It should be that if you practice long and hard enough you can achieve anything (whether boy or girl). Basicaly it feels like they wanted to make a really ""star warsy"" movie that introduces young audiences to the themes and reminds old viewers what happened in ep 4 without actually working on a strong story. They just mixed up the details a bit and made it a next episode. I call them fillers in series, guessing ep 8 will contain the real story. ps.: honestly though, you'd think making the death star 2 times and getting it destroyed by a meager force would have taught the empire something, but these space Nazis never learn. i guess no one had a better idea as to what menace should be stopped."
" Fanservice brought to you by J.J. Abrams
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,6,"So when Disney bought Lucasfilms and announced a new trilogy of Star Wars films, I was initially skeptical. We had just gotten over the disappointment that were the prequels and it seemed like the originals were going to be tarnished.However, as time went on, the trailers came out and they seemed fairly promising. They announced the new cast and of course there was backlash from bigots over John Boyega's ethnicity. Any excuse for keyboard warriors to kick up a fuss.Then the actual film came out. At the time, I really enjoyed it, but as time passed, I came to accept that for the most part, it's more or less a complete 'copy and paste' of Episode IV.The First Order, under the command of Kylo Ren is desperate to retrieve secret plans hidden inside an astro droid discovered by a young Force-sensitive girl who teams up with a rag-tag team of heroes, determined to return the plans to the Resistance, to fight against a planet-destroying superweapon and track down the location of a wise self-exiled mentor. Hmmm, I wonder if that sounds familiar? OK, apart from the fact that this is a complete retelling of the original story, it has its charm. The new cast are a fine addition to the roster of characters. Daisy Ridley as Rey is compelling, and I'm probably biased because I have a massive celebrity crush on her (pretty sure I'm not the only one) but that's besides the point. John Boyega is an enjoyable character as Finn, whose comradery with Oscar Isaac's Poe is fun to watch. Old favourites, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, C-3PO and R2-D2 return, handing over the baton to the newcomers.Kylo Ren, played by Adam Driver is the new ""Dark Lord"", heavily conflicted in his position on the dark side, inspired by his late grandfather Darth Vader. A former disciple of Luke Skywalker, he became seduced by the dark side by Palpatine 2.0, oh sorry, I mean Snoke, and is more unhinged than previous Sith Lords.As a movie, it's produced very well and is an enjoyable popcorn flick, putting aside the fact that it's mainly just on repeat for the entirety. Many people laid into the character of Rey, calling her a 'Mary-Sue', calling her too overpowered and simply labelled this film as feminist propaganda. Once again, keyboard warriors with nothing better to do.It's enjoyable for the most part, and is merely a love letter to the original series. I will say that I'm worried now that Abrams is directing Episode IX, just because it's just gonna be another 'copy and paste'.Another thing I'm worried about is, as I said earlier, tarnishing the original story, with Disney having plans to release multiple Star Wars films for the next 5-10 years at least. The oversaturation is going to ruin the series in my opinion, but let's just see what happens in the meantime."
" A Wanna-Be 'Star Wars' Film
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,1,"I know this, among a thousand other reviews, shall simply find itself as one among plethora of negative reviews. But that wont stop me from adding my voice to how simply boring this movie was. It was truly a Chop job movie. To have more than enough boring material meshed with so little embarrassment into the old stuff everyone loves is truly an act of amazing nerve.We all have read countless reviews that say this reboot has lost all heart and doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie and the answer to that is simply........of course.From heart-free lame fights to nonsensical copy/paste droids rethreading the original movies this lame duck has nothing anyone wants in a Star Wars film. And that is just for beginners! There are some real moments of raw nerve too that should earn the stooge Jar Jar Abrams and Disney a need to get body guards.The plot is perfection, the new characters had perfect chemistry with the old, the effects were even more mind blowing than the trailers led to me believe, etc etc etc Please don't even bother reading any laughable negative reviews, simply see this spectacle for yourself.10"
" A remake of the original trilogy, without the charm of the original.
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,5,"To preface this review I will say while I am a Star Wars fan I am not a huge Star Wars fan. That is to say I have no real emotional attachment to the franchise although I've rewatched the movies quite a bit. I get more emotional about the sullying of Marvel super heroes and Batman than any other film. I'd lose my sh** if James Bond were made black, but could care less what diversity is put into Star Wars. I'm just not that much of a purist.So it doesn't bother me than Kylo Ren is not a bada** like Vader, but rather an emo kid. It doesn't bother me that Rey makes the force seem like superpowers, rather than a Samurai code mixed with Eastern and Western religions. Nor does it bother me that a stormtrooper is black despite them being clones, but no longer clones because this movie seems to ignore the prequels as much as possible. However I remember when the prequels came out there was hype, then finally acceptance that maybe they weren't very good. The prequels problems are easily pinned down however; the two leads lacked chemistry, Anakin's actor(s) was wooden and unlikeable, and Jar Jar Binks. Other than that they were creative, did massive mythology building, and felt like they had the same man (Lucas) behind them. The originals were this wild fever dream made on a limited budget in a desert. The prequels were the same visionary being made to force will out another three movies, and it showed. The Force Awakens is a board room trying to replicate a formula so they can sell toys, and man does it show.There's a reason I mention budget. Bryan Singer once noted his restrained budget on X-Men 1 and 2 forced him to write scenes with actual dialogue. Huh? Fancy that. Turns out when you slow down instead of giving the audience cgi whiplash you get a better product. That's one instance where TFA fails; pacing. It moves along at breakneck speed. The closest we ever get to a Star Wars film is a brief interval where Rey meets BB-8. That may be the closest the film comes to actual character development.The dialogue is all wrong. It can be summed up by Finn asking ""do you have a boyfriend"" promptly after meeting Rey? Who f***ing cares? Is this Star Wars or She's All That? In the original trilogy(s) the dialogue is very regal, so much so it makes Han Solo's character stand out. Han Solo is the audience; he's blue collar, doesn't believe what he's seeing, thinks fantasy tropes are for nerds, and loves guns. He's the antithesis of everything that's going on around him. So as we watch him slowly buy into all this ""hokey nonsense"" so do we. Because at it's core Star Wars isn't about Jedi, it's about friends coming together to fight a great evil. This movies is about....""hey remember that movie Star Wars, man that was great"".The dialogue is very riffy and self aware. They practically break the fourth wall. From the beginning with ""who talks first, do I talk first, do you talk first?"" It almost sounds like a Star Wars Robot Chicken episode poking fun at the tropes. It doesn't stop there. We are treated to lines like ""that's not how the force works"" and ""is there a trash compactor somewhere"" as if people really talk like that. As if the characters in the movie have watched the Star Wars movies. The characters rarely share their thoughts or emotions. Remember the quiet scenes where Obi Wan speaks cryptically about his past, or where the characters get to know each other? There's none of that. The film is so ready to get back to hyperspace it can barely breathe. There's no tension built through dialogue, and the emotions are unearned. Rey crying over Han? Why? You don't even know him. He's a guy you met an hour ago. Even worse he offered you a job on his ship seconds after meeting you. Who's Maz Kanata? Why do we care? The humor doesn't work either. It's just the same one liners you find in every Marvel movie. The movie is just flat. It's a good action movie to some degree, but also uninspired and lackluster. The prequels committed the sin of not being very good, but this commits the unforgivable sin of being bland."
" Much weaker than first two trilogies
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,5,"I want to say that this is the first Star Wars movie which I didn't have the need to see twice or more. First six movies I can watch over and over again, with the healthy pause between them, of course, enjoying them each time. This one, and I fear next to follow, I simply didn't have the usual need to watch again. I felt kind of strange. Something was missing.The story is far to similar to Episode IV but more of a problem was lack of combats, especially in space, lack of different worlds, aliens, all that. Furthermore, in each movie so far there were a strange monsters. Plus ""million"" other smaller and bigger things.Episode VII is simply weak. Very weak. There is not nearly enough complexity, depth, details, story, everything. As if it's just made to make money.I am quite disappointed. Yeah, a Trekkie shouldn't have directed a Star Wars movie."
" Did not feel like Star Wars
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,2,"Here is a list of why this movie blows and why it didn't feel like Star Wars.1. There was to much forced comedy with Finn, Poe, Solo, and Kylo Ren. Keep it simple with just BB-8. 2. Poe takes out 10 Tie Fighters and 2 stormtroopers within 10 seconds in his X-wing. Not even Wedge can do that. This ruined the whole movie for me. 3. Poe talks about how Tie Fighters can ""really move"" when he's flying one but then he is able to fly circles around them in his X-wing. 4. Kylo Ren uses force stasis on blaster bolts. Force Stasis only works on people, not blasters bolts.5. No call signs for pilots. In this movie they were Cowboys in space. Not once they say, for example ""This is Red-5."" 6. Finn is able to take on a Sith lord, without dying. A trooper fighting a Sith lord would not be able to hold their ground, but Finn did. 7. A remake of A New Hope.8. I love John Williams but the musical score was kind of weak. 9. C-3P0 has a red arm. Why? And why does he have 2 gold arms at the very end? lol No explanation. 10. Rey uses Jedi Mind trick on a stormtrooper and she has never been trained to use the force. Enough said."
" Back to Basics
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,8,"I just re-watched the movie last night after finally getting my 4K Blu- Ray player and television and 7.1 surround set up and was quite happy with the film (even though not 4K) overall with the visual and sound.I gave the film an 8 rating only for what I thought was a somewhat disappointing ending. I know this is integral with how it will tie in with Episode IX coming out on December 15th.After the dismal failure of the I, II, III trilogy where I almost walked out of the theater on Episode I but after paying good money I forced myself to sit through it. Needless to say, I did not go to the theater to see episodes II and III so, after all the hype this movie was getting I decided to see it on the big screen.Everything about this movie worked and I think J.J. Abrams was smart by taking Star Wars back to its roots. Yes, he borrowed a lot from the second trilogy of Episode IV but it worked in his favor. Even if you had never seen a Star Wars movie, this was a good way to get both old and new followers to the franchise.The story is fast paced and the visual effects are top notch. I especially liked the scenes on Jakku where old wreckage of Imperial ships are strewn across the sand dunes. Rey (Daisy Ridley) the protagonist of the story uses an old AT-AT as her home. She is unlike any other character shown in the Star Wars universe as she is a scavenger and every day is a struggle to survive in that harsh world.She and Finn (John Boyega) is a former stormtrooper of the First Order and work well together as there is instant chemistry when they first meet when he sees her fight off a group of thugs.It goes without saying that seeing Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford together again was a treat. Knowing their history together and finding out more of what happened to them 30 years after Return of the Jedi. Their appearance plays an integral part to the story and brings the story-line full circle.I look forward to seeing Episode IX in two weeks but saddened as well as I know this was the final screen appearance of Carrie Fisher before her passing last year."
" Boycott Episode 8
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,1,It will be as silly and spoofy and boring as this. The force Awakens is the most ironic title for a movie since White Chicks. Please do not walk into a cinema to be voluntarily pick-pocketed. I want to revert back to my childhood when there were only 3 Star Wars films and they were all beyond great.
" I like this star wars movie
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,8,I like this movie because the action in this movies was amazing and I like how the characters from the last movies return. In this movie it show what happening more than action and how to now what right and to escape from someone or something. And the new little guy is awesome it runs around helping it companions in difficult situations and try to survive. but what good is they found something that was lost and met something that disappear for a long time overall it a good to watch.
" All the Reboot/Sequel Tropes in One Movie
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,5,"On the surface, it would seem The Force Awakens did everything I'd want to see from it: likably interesting new characters, nostalgic old ones, entertaining adventure mixed with tragic heartbreak, and quality filmmaking techniques consistent with the originals. But while all this might makes one leave the theater feeling satisfied, it merely masks the gaping, fundamental issues at its core.It's actually quite amazing how perfectly The Force Awakens encapsulates everything I despise about remakes, reboots, and sequels. Here is my list of a few of the tropes I loathe the most about such franchises, and how The Force Awakens violates all of them:1. Unoriginality: Surely no sequel mimics any other nearly to the extent that Episode 7 does to Episode 4- not in a subtle, nuanced way, but more of a ""you automatically fail the course for plagiarizing"" sort of way. It's not only certain elements, it's the framework of the movie as a whole: unlikely hero from sand planet discovers Jedi potential on adventure to help rebellion destroy the dark side's mega weapon. It's not simply paying homage to the original or using it as a sort of archetype, it's straight up recycling the main plot points and feeding from the brand it's created. 2. Shifting Morals and Themes: Abrams seems to be under the impression that the aforementioned plot framework is what makes Star Wars great. What made Star Wars great to me is the personal journeys of Anakin and Luke to choose good or evil, and the ultimate triumph over evil. That was the character arc, and it all wrapped together nicely. The new franchise reboot seems to disregard that in order to add a different, ambiguous spin on what the ""balance of the Force"" actually means.3. Characters Jarred from their Happily Ever After: The same ambiguity given to the themes is reflected onto our heroes. Call me naïve if you will, but I believe that some stories deserve happy endings. The original Star Wars trilogy has a happy ending. When we last saw them, Luke had defeated the Dark Side, Han and Leia were happily in love, the Rebellion had overthrown the Empire. Legalities aside, what right does the new franchise have in saying, ""Psych! Just kidding! All those things were a lie, an illusion- the situation is actually quite opposite of all those things!"" If a reboot wants to honor and respect the original, it starts first and foremost with not spitting on its story. 4. The ""Bigger and Badder"" Effect: Sequels furthermore downplay the seeming success of its predecessor's story by the emergence of a threat that's much worse than what's come before. ""You thought the Empire/Darth Vader/Death Star was bad? Well that's no match for the One Order/Snoke/Death Planet!"" It's egregious how shamelessly this escalation is presented, and it's supposed to be accepted at face value as if it makes any intuitive sense why a story continuously levels up to the next higher boss as if it's a '90s video game.5. Unexplained/ Weakly Explained Circumstances: The prequel trilogy spent three movies showing the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire, while the original trilogy spent three movies showing the Empire's overthrow. It's fulfilling to see the Rebellion triumphant at long last. And then in the following episode, the Empire (now ""The One Order"") is essentially in charge again? And they're stronger than ever before? And Han and Leia are divorced? And the Millennium Falcon is gone? And Luke is missing? And R2-D2 is busted? All out of nowhere? What? Those are all pretty big story elements to simply be glanced over by a line of dialogue here and there, don't you think? Oh, I must have forgotten to scour the internet for all the blog articles explaining and theorizing the convolution, silly me to think a story is supposed to be self-explanatory and maintain any reasonable flow.6. Rejecting resolution in favor of becoming another generic gateway to an endless cash cow franchise: In the 136 minutes of this movie, nothing was resolved beyond the trivial. Sure the Death MacGuffin was blown up, but all character development (which is the heart of the Star Wars story) was left at a cliffhanger, and mostly left unexplained. (Han Solo's death had no closure because the backstory was missing.) The capabilities for meaningful themes and closure in a story are severely limited when that story is intended to continue in perpetuity into the eternities. If you're a big Star Wars fan, then you might eat it all up because 1. it is entertaining, and 2. it gives you a bunch of stuff to discuss until the next trailer comes out. But for me, it's disappointing and aggravating to see a franchise sacrificed to the Almighty Dollar so ruthlessly, and it represents so much of what I dislike about the state of today's movie industry. I gave this reboot a chance, I won't feed the Disney Sequel Monster again."
" Where do the professional critics get their delusions from? It's almost as if they are paid by Disney to deliver good reviews
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,1,"Just quickly going through the most popular professional reviews makes me shudder because of either how parochially minded or ignorant these people are. The focus of this review, however, is not to draw on examples of poor reviews by critics, but I thought it would be an interesting observation I'd like to mention at the start of this. My main problem with the movie is that there are literally no likable characters within it - and this is down to the poor writing and directing. Even characters like Han Solo and Princess Leia, who are conjointly part of everyone's favourite star wars characters amongst all of the movies are not particularly likable in this film. For example, in the trailer for this movie, I remember being euphoric from witnessing Han Solo and Chewbacca enter the Millennium Falcon with the accompanying quote ""Chewie, we're home""; but while watching the movie, your mind doesn't make that same connection because of the clearly evident lack of depth and poorly paced film that this is. I personally felt little connection to the main characters - it felt like they were designed to appeal to children through the rather cringe worthy one-liner jokes mainly, and also to the politically correct culture, instead of to anyone willing to be captivated again by the Star Wars universe where storytelling is the central focus, not a rushed disjointed reiteration of certain elements of the fourth movie in the saga. It emulates branding; as if it were a product of a company straight off the assembly line. You have your BB8 figurines, which are your guaranteed post-theatre income from all the children waiting to get their hands on them; you have the standard shallow special effects and imagery which is the agent to lure people into the cinemas and you also have specific nuances within the film, tailored to perpetuate the modern Disney ideas and beliefs into the Star Wars universe with aim to indoctrinate younger children who obviously don't see through this. If it possessed any decent plot or story, then I wouldn't think like this.These are specific elements in which I found striking, and tried to have a unique look on the film without going into the obvious and truthful 'Mary Sue', and terrible acting critiques. One thing that has really bugged me over the past couple of years since this film was the death of Han Solo. I felt that such a legendary character shouldn't have had such a send off at the hands of such an incompetent and unworthy production and direction team. Part of me is still convinced that Han Solo hasn't died. That's probably because I really do not associate this film with actual Star Wars - at the hands of George Lucas; this film is merely an amateurish parody of a New Hope that isn't worthy enough of being a sequel of the original trilogy. It angers me that this storyline is canon in the Star Wars universe as the golden original trilogy which everyone loved, for whom this era has used its characters, deserve to have a more than adequate script and story supporting them. This film truly breaks my heart, and is potentially an archetype for the corporate storytelling that is yet to fully mobilise in this current day and age."
" I think I saw this in 1977
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,2,"I kept hoping the story would somehow deviate from the first issued movie in the franchise, it may well have later in the film but I was already distracted by online Mah Jong and didn't pay close attention.Coming to IMDb I was astonished to see an 8.1 overall rating, but that will probably come down now that it's on Amazon Prime.I would also like to congratulate the cast for not out-acting the cast from the original movie, in fact the acting was so generally stiff I wouldn't be at all surprised if they took acting tips from Jonathan Frakes and Wil Wheaton.Yet no doubt the forward momentum will make Star Wars VIII The Last Jedi (for release Christmas 2017) a big hit, and it may be great ... then again it just may be a clone of Star Wars IV A New Hope.Despite my intellectual disdain for this story I was a surprised with my emotional sympathy, I wrote it off to a decades long investment in the story, then again maybe it was just the musical score."
" terrible.....
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,1,i have read all the negative comments and unfortunately cannot dispute a single one. This is the worst movie i have ever seen...so badly put together that you would think that a bunch of teenagers at acting and directing schools had made it. How can this have happened? And why on earth is there an 8.1 rating from this site. Seriously?
" Never thought I'd long for the days of Jar Jar Binks & little Anakin destroying the droid control ship on a fluke....yet here we are.
",2017-11-14 00:00:00,1,"After re-watching episodes 1 to 6 for the first time in a while, it just puts into perspective how BAD this film was, and how it betrays everything Star Wars stands for. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a ""die hard"" Star Wars fan, but even I know this was trash. I remember when I was 5 and my family were staying up late one night to watch A New Hope. I only managed to stay awake long enough to see Luke & Obi-Wan meet Han & Chewie, but it wasn't for lack of trying because that film had my undivided attention. And it was no different when I got older. I hadn't seen Revenge of the Sith since the cinema...and I have to admit it wasn't as bad as I remember it being. Sure it was rushed and there were holes in the plot, but I didn't feel my IQ dropping or the need to leave the cinema. Jar Jar Binks would have been a better lead character than Rey. Not only was she shallow & 1 dimensional as a character, but this Daisy Ridley cannot act to save her life. Every time she was on screen, I KNEW she was acting, it was so obvious. JJ Abrams must have thought ""in order to really make this movie terribly bad, I'm going to go out and find the worst actor/actress possible to play the lead"", well mission accomplished JJ. And whenever Kylo Ren would have one of his ""sith tantrums"", it just reminded me of a liberal guy being triggered - not intimidating, not awe inspiring like a REAL villain should be. If Darth Vader just stood there and did nothing, he would still be a better villain. I'm honestly trying to find 1 positive thing to say about the movie, but I honestly don't remember it that well since I haven't seen it since the cinema and don't ever plan on watching it again via my own free will"
" A Strong Start to This New Trilogy
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,7,"My original review of this movie was ridiculously bad. I don't know if that's the case with all of my older reviews, but after rewatching the movie and reading that pathetic review, I felt it needed a re-review. First I will point out what everyone else has: the story of this movie is not original at all and quite a bit is taken from A New Hope. The most obvious is the reuse Death Star plot. I am absolutely sick and tired of the same plot of ""some evil guys built a giant planet destroying space station."" There is so much more you can do with this series than that story or character wise. However, I will defend this a little bit. Kylo Ren, who I'm assuming came up with the idea to build Death Star three, worships the very ground Darth Vader walked on. So, it wouldn't be the only time Kylo Ren copied Vader in some way in the movie. Outside of the Death Star three plot, there are enough different elements for me to keep it interesting and I really love the new characters. Rey was significantly different from Luke and NOT a mary sue in my opinion. Yes, she is really powerful with the force when she uses it and but she is still a well defined character. Her sharp tongue and no nonsense personality make her entertaining me. Plus, unlike mary sues, she is flawed. Her most glaring flaw is that she's living in the past and refuses to move on and accept the inevitable which I personally found very relatable and engaging. Honestly, I think she is a better character than Luke in A New Hope. First of all, Daisy Ridley nails that performance while Mark Hamill always seemed a little bland and kind of whiny to me although he did get better in the later movies. Second, Rey has a more interesting backstory. I mean, she lost her parents at a young age and grew up completely alone for most of her life as a scavenger on Jakku! Luke was just kind of brought to Tatooine and raised by his extended family before leaving with Obi Wan. Third, as I've already mentioned, Rey is very relatable while Luke never really interested or appealed to me. Of the other new characters, Finn and Kylo Ren are the most interesting. I'll quickly discuss Finn first. As I mentioned earlier, having a stormtrooper as a main character is one of the few different things story-wise from A New Hope and it makes Finn a very unique character. He's not however, a dashing hero and more of a coward. I know some people hated that but I think it makes sense given his backstory and adds to his uniqueness more. Now onto Kylo Ren. When I first saw this movie in theaters, I hated this character purely because he killed Han Solo, who's not only my favorite character from the original trilogy, but also his own father. However, after some rewatches, I slowly began to find this character intriguing. When he took of his mask (physically and metaphorically), all I saw was a lost soul who doesn't know his place in the world, not unlike Rey. During the scene where he interrogates Rey especially, a very different side of this character shines through. In nearly every other scene in the film, Kylo Ren is cold, ruthless, demanding and honestly terrifying when angered. Yet in that scene with Rey, he was very civil and gentle with her and never really physically or emotionally harmed her. Even when she clearly angered him by revealing his fear of never being as strong as Darth Vader, he didn't hurt her, at least not intentionally and I don't think he wanted to. This side of his character really fascinated me because we rarely see it. Just that scene and maybe his scene with Han Solo. You know, before he kills him that is. On the topic of that scene, it still makes me cry. That will never change but I realized hating Kylo Ren purely for that was kind of shallow. Especially since from I observed, Kylo Ren found no pleasure or strength in killing his father. He just looked like he was about to cry throughout that whole scene. He's a very conflicted character is my point and it's not cringe worthy at all unlike Anakin. It doesn't justify his actions at all but it does make him interesting and a lot of that comes from Adam Driver's great acting. In fact, the acting in this movie in general is seamless to me. Not once did the acting seem awkward or flat which was one of my problems with A New Hope. Actually, that's not even the only thing this movie does better than A New Hope. I also thought the action and cinematography was a lot more intense and engaging. The action scenes in this movie involve a lot of movement, varied settings, and varied forms of attack unlike A New Hope where two old men tap lightsticks and a group of people shoot down crappy soldiers in tight hallways. Not to say that A New Hope doesn't have good action but The Force Awakens is superior to it in that respect. In conclusion, the Force Awakens did reuse an overdone plotpoint in Star Wars but is overall entertaining and engaging enough for me to enjoy it."
" it should have been epic....
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,7,"the PC-ness of the current Jedi films, is a bit overwhelming. if you don't have "" Diversity"" in the cast, it gets blasted by idiot critics. how about just casting competent people, and not worry if its a ""Rainbow coalition"" of actors..?? I was seriously underwhelmed by most of the top billed actors, they don't ""grab"" your attention, the action does. Ewan MacGregor was a wonderful Kinobi.. Daisy Ridley.. John Boyega,, sorry, neither of them really shine like a Nova in the films.. passable, yes, palatable.. maybe.. but, worthy of carrying the likes of these films ?? not remotely. shoot me for wanting SOLID people in a Sci Fi flick of this import... Adam Driver as Kylo Ren... even his character is still a bit ' out to lunch"".. for someone who is to be a major Menace to the entire galaxy, he seems like less of a threat than your local security guard in the alien bar in Mos Eisley space port.. just way to much money available to have gone after better fits.. I would rather see Denzel Washington as Kylo Ren, or some other major character, because he is GOOD.. maybe Timothy Oliphant, or Anson Mount, or a whole HOST of others from other Sci Fi films.. even Channing Tatum could fill Boyegas role better, and be more believable.. sorry, just a good film now, not the Epic one for the next 30 yrs it should have been.."
" Everything we know and love about Star Wars
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,10,"I'll be honest, in the months leading up to the release of JJ Abrams sequel I was growing increasingly skeptical about his ability to do the film justice. But after finally seeing it, I was SERIOUSLY impressed! Abrams is clearly a loyal, highly intelligent fan of the saga, and has done all Star Wars fans a great service. The pacing and flow of the film is a mixture of the original and prequel trilogy, and left me almost wishing Abrams had taken the reigns for the prequels as well. It is amazingly written and directed with stunning visuals and cinematography.The action is fast paced and flawless (the space battle scenes and light saber duels especially) and the story woven with emotion and the best occasional gags and one liners to date. I particularly enjoyed the character of Kylo Ren and was left begging for more backstory and information on this confused and helpless villain People certainly loved to point out downfalls in George Lucas' prequels, but it's factually obvious Abrams has completely delivered on all fronts in doing the saga justice! 10/10"
" New director, new plot, still the Star Wars I loved
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,10,"You might have read other reviews, where a lot of negative feedbacks are given, most commonly you might see ""it was a reboot of its past episodes!"" (wrong and laughably again), or even more hilariously ""it was nothing like George Lucas' Star Wars films!"". But fortunately most people by now know that when there is a change of director within a franchise you can always expect the movies to have a lot of contrary, clueless whiny trolls crying about them. Though most tend to die off and go on with their lives the first few weeks after the movie releases.......at least all the ones that actually HAVE lives do ; )You have to give JJ credit, he did a helluva great job and even managed to SURPASS the original trilogy. How many other sequel directors can say that.....exactly.There is more humor compared to the other Star Wars, which I believe played a big part in the success of this new installment. To cap off, this new episode is worth the wait. A new beginning, a new set of characters, but it's still the Star Wars I fell in love with. I have and will watch it again and again, it's THAT good : )"
" All of the best parts of the Original Trilogy, with none of the cheese!
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,10,"The film is easily the best written of the entire franchise; with clever, witty dialogue (for the first time in the series history). It also has the most humanity, and thoughtful drama. It's surreal seeing Han, Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, and other original cast members, on the big screen again (in a new movie); and I think it was justifiable asking Fisher and Hamill to lose weight, for their parts (it's necessary to the roles they're playing). The new characters are also extremely likable, and soon to be classic, as well. Ridley is a revelation, and I think she rivals Jennifer Lawrence; for one of the best performances of the year! Driver, Boyega and Isaac are all fantastic as well; and Ford is, once again, classic! The movie (without question) deserved several Oscar nominations; for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, acting and more. The approach Abrams takes, to the material, is exactly right (it's traditional, old fashioned filmmaking). The film is everything you could possibly expect (or want) from a 'STAR WARS' movie; it's funny, heartfelt, touching and action- packed. It's far and away the best film in the series since Empire Strikes Back.The perfect TEN!"
" Loved it. Grade: A+++++
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,10,"The original cast is back and fits in beautifully with the new crew. The CGI are great and the movie as a whole is A MASTERPIECE.This movie did a brilliant job of taking new actors with a new story (this is Star Wars for the new generation after all) and combined them with the original actors and clever references to the original trilogy. The dialogue was perfect for this movie (and very much in JJ Abrams' style) with just enough witty banter and clever one liners to keep you amused amidst all the serious action.And finally that brings me to the action. it was believable, and was perfectly reminiscent of the original trilogy. It is its own wonderful movie but is still definitively Star Wars. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise, any younger fans, fans of a good action and adventure movie, or fans of just incredible filmmaking period!"
" Star Wars 7
",2017-11-07 00:00:00,3,What can I say as a Star Wars fan I admit I was excited to see this movie. After watching it I was speechless. It was that bad. No original ideas completely trash storyline the only improvement was the animations. Disney needs to have an original idea and try not to create garbage. If you watch the movie again closely you will see that the plot and everything else follows the New Hope. And what about the fact that Rey in like two days could wield a lightsaber and beat people with it. That's so dumb and that's why this deserves a 3/10
" STAR WARS but for normies and casual fans
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,2,"Let me just say NOBODY, NOBODY wanted to see this movie more than me. Ever since I was a little kid I had always wanted them to continue the movie trilogies, so of course I was ecstatic to hear that Disney would be continuing it.(ironic)I will never forget what it was like seeing this movie in theaters for the first 20 seconds. I was so excited to see what they would do with the extended universe material. What new places they would make, what new enemies would be fought, but to my disappointment, its a minus well be episode 4 again. The problem with this movie is very simple,it is a remake of episode 4. All the plot points are the same for the most part. No new cool places, no new cool enemies, just the same stuff as last time. For example, the movie starts on a desert planet, like ep 4, there's a droid that has secret plans on it, like ep 4, there's a planet destroying space station, like, episode 4, and there's a battle between the old mentor and bad guy antagonist like ep 4. JJ Abrams lack of creativity is what ruined this movie, as well as his wanting to make the concept of Star Wars so sterile and capid it loses all its morals.The one thing that infuriates me so much about this movie though is what Disney did to it. I don't care that the main protagonist is female, or that there's a black storm trooper or any of that crap. Its the damage they did to the Star Wars narrative and ultimately the community. This movie is made for NORMIES. Now I know what you are thinking ""must be one of those Star Wars elitists again"" no thats not the case. I don't think you need to know all 50 something hyperspace lanes in the galaxy to be a real Star Wars fan but come on, open your eyes. Its so obvious that this movie is made to be as vapid and simple as possible. This movie is essentially made for millenials and soccer mom families who can go to the theatre and be like ""oh ye get the bad guys"" and ""oh no the mean dude blew up the stuff"". For example, what made the destruction of Alderran so horrifying in episode 4 was how the empire seemingly blew it up in such a quick and heartless manner, really showing their strength and cruelty. But in episode 7 when they blow it up, there's no weight to it, heck you don't even know what system they attacked or what the point of it was. It makes the audience feel disconnected from the event. (For those of you who don't know the system that gets destroyed is the Hosnian system which a large portion of the Republic fleet was stationed at). Nope just show some people looking scared and a scary laser going across the sky.I understand Star Wars was meant to be a simple movie that anyone could watch and enjoy, its very universal. But the only reason why it was so universally loved was because of a great story that was also very simple and easy to follow. But there's no innovation here, its not challenging or interesting. You can have a great simple story thats innovating enough and brings in new elements without the audience having to know all the backstory. But there's none of that in episode 7, they don't bring in any nee concepts, because Abrams was to concerned making sure they could sell BB-8 toys instead of making a new unique story.Thats really the problem with this movie, it was made so the average family wouldn't get challenged or offended by anything and just go buy some BB-8 toys for Christmas."
" Go for Star Wars Legends instead
",2017-10-31 00:00:00,2,I was initially hopeful for this movie when I read that it had a strong female lead. But the female character was about the only positive thing which stuck with me. Too much stuff from previous movies are repeated in lower quality ways. And too much was an excessive stretch of both Star Wars and sci-fi.
" A good reminder to not revisit the prequels or the original trilogy
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,3,"Episodes four to six were... OK, if I remember right? I watched them as a kid but they were nothing too special, I never grew too fond of the Star Wars lore. I watched the episodes one to three when they appeared, and if I remember right, I liked them when I was a kid. They were loud and fun and suspenseful. Rewatching them few years ago made me realize that the prequel trilogy was mostly as horrible as people claim them to be.With this to back everything up, I wasn't too enthusiastic to watch the hyped Force Awakens. It was hard to not make up my mind about the movie before even seeing it, the reception ranged from being a poor cash- grab remake of the original from the best movie ever.I had to watch it. Well, start watching it. The movie is still playing when I type this review and it has been maybe the most annoying movie I've seen for a while.Why does Finn break free from the Stormtroopers? What happened to the Clone Army? Why did they break Leia and Han up? Why does General Hux Weasley seem to be the most insecure military general in a movie ever? Could Rey be anymore annoying? Could Finn be anymore annoying? Could Kylo Ren be anymore annoying?The movie made me realize one thing. I like DC movies because I love the comics. I acknowledge the flaws of recent DC movies (Suicide Squad was poor, Batman v Superman is a hard one to love). Watching The Force Awakens must be what it would be like to watch Batman v Superman without knowing and loving the lore. It would be horrible.Watching this movie is almost unbearable, almost every character is annoying in some way. It almost feels like a race between the characters who can be the most illogical and annoying in the movie.The movie just doesn't stop feeling like just another popcorn blockbuster which has been made a million times over and over. This could be called Transformers: The Spark Awakens. Just change everything related to Star Wars to Transformers and it could be a sequel to Age of Exctinction.And instead of being praised, it would receive the reviews this movie should have received in the first place.Boring, annoying and generic random late night snack flick."
" Most boring Star Wars movie
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,3,"1. It's a ""New Hope"" Remake 2. The Enemies are bad. Snoke is 1:1 like Sidious, Kylo Ren is a crybaby and i can't take him serious and the rest of the first order are space Nazis. 3. Rey is overpowered 4. It was obvious that Han Solo will die 5. Boring 6. Many things don't make any sense (like a third Death Star after the first and second one got destroyed) 7. THIS MOVIE IS WORTHLESS! Why should I watch it again? It's the same Story like in ""New Hope"", the character aren't interesting and it's adds nothing new to the Star Wars franchise!"
" Porgs
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,1,"It seems that this piece of crap will keep on sinking down despite the tremendous effort probably of Jar Jar Abrams himself (Note that how many 10/10 reviews could be recently read below praising JJ Abrams). Before me many other real reviewers have already written down why this abomination does just not deserve to be called a movie: no plot, terrible acting, not respecting the nature of the force, insanity of Starkiller base: sucking a sun and exploding worlds hundreds of Light Years far away with a laser beam (which travel with max. speed of light)etc. Beside all of these I would like to highlight how this thing downgraded complete and living worlds to merely a stage of a theater act. There is a desert world with a tiny camp containing a shop where you can buy food for crap, there is no history, no reasons why it exists. Just a shop surrounded by tents. There is a forest world with a cantina in middle of it. Just a cantina. There is a tiny secret base of rebels without any reason for its existence. And there is the planet for the imperials. ...and one more word: Porgs will come..."
" More social justice at its worst
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,1,"Besides the fact that this movie is a complete rip off of the original and some of the laziest writing in movie history, its a complete slap in the face to the fans who made the franchise what it is today. From the beginning you have the nearly all white male army with the exception of 2 characters that resembles Nazis, 1 is the only black storm trooper who can see how evil these white men are and decides he wants no part of this. 2 is the only woman storm trooper who is obviously the only strong and competent one out of the entire army. You got the main villain who looks like some kid that gets his lunch money stolen every day and throws temper tantrums like a 5 year old. Now to the main star, forget Luke Skywalker. In his place they put a 90 pound woman to be the hero. Not only is she a hero but she can use the force without even knowing she has it and win a light saber duel against a trained Jedi because girl power. No Yoda no problem, they managed to create a female that resembles him to take his place. she serves no real purpose but damned if they're not gonna replace every male character possible. There are 2 white heroes in this movie, one who you see for a total of about 5 minutes when the plot calls for it and Han Solo who is killed off so the female and back guy get to fly his ship without looking like the bad guys and give the fans some sense of nostalgia while they destroy one of the greatest film franchises. So much effort was spent in replacing white male characters that the new characters have no substance whatsoever. At no point do you think the heroes might fail nor do you care. The story and characters all suffered because of Hollywood and now Disney SJW agenda."
" There has been an awakening... and it's wonderful!!!
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,10,"Finally Star Wars is back in full force! Beautiful acting, stunning practical effects and a great story. Now that the theme has been set, there are a lot of paths which the next installments could go down. My only complaint is that 2 hours and 15 minutes went by so damn quick that it felt like barely 30 minutes and I wanted MORE! XD. All in all this makes for a great Star Wars.5 out of 5 stars and very effortlessly the best film in the series."
" Now THIS is Star Wars!
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie is amazing, entertaining, and well crafted as a film in generalThe film is incredibly exciting with humor, action, references and a beautifully written plot. This movie will blow you away, as both a Star Wars fan and a movie fan. If you actually like Star Wars you will love this film, end of story.It is safe to say that J.J Abrams has fulfilled his mission in bringing back Star Wars to its former glory! Cannot wait for Episode 9!Rating: 10 out of 10"
" Not a terrible film, but not much good either.
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,5,"I grew up on Star Wars, I idolized Star Wars characters as a kid, and owned just about any memorabilia I could get my hands on. This film's new characters just couldn't cut it. The VFX and CGI were good though, and it really bought goosebumps to hear the title theme again, but eh. Storyline was rather weak, no good characters, just feels like this film exists to continue ripping money out of nostalgia. The film had no great moments, nothing that I would want to talk about years from now or even right after the film ended. The original trilogy was greatness, would honestly just rather see 100% remakes of those with modern technology."
" Cynical Remake They Call A Sequel
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,1,"This film was awful. It is just a cash cow to add to the monthly Marvel release schedule of Disney.The Disney princess has super powers, but is not attractive in any way (OK granted it is not as bad as Spy or Ghostbusters).There is Darth Vader clone who throws temper tantrums and takes his mask off every five minutes. Why have it? Either Disney needs to sell merchandise or the movie is cheap and the angry emo kid can't breathe.Then there is the Disney princess' love interest who is a janitor, but part of the vanguard of troops (the first order is environmentally conscious and cleans after itself?).Jarringly bad and stupid."
" Easily the worst Star Wars film yet. A real insult to intelligence.
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,1,"I will offer my thoughts about the new Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer. This new trailer, by the way, again got me to think about how bad of a film Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) is. I began watching videos and reading articles that criticize and pick apart this film, and I'll later post some of these videos on my blog. I've known from the beginning that it's not a good film, but I now realize that The Force Awakens is truly the worst Star Wars film so far. I really enjoyed watching and reading the negative things that people have to say about it. Here are a few reasons why it's so bad:It is pretty much rip-off of Star Wars (1977). In addition, it is a much worse film than Star Wars. Why should I watch an inferior version of a film that already exists? I'd rather watch the 1977 original. And, not surprisingly, I haven't seen The Force Awakens since that one time in December of 2015.The new characters (Kylo Ren, Rey, Finn and others) are not interesting or appealing. They're pretty much inferior copies of old characters like Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader. These new characters are just more proof that screen writers in Hollywood can no longer write believable human characters.The Starkiller Base makes no sense. How could the First Order create a weapon that's several times bigger than the Death Star? Where did they get the time or the resources for this? In addition, the laws of physics don't apply to this thing. Is The Force Awakens more of a fantasy or more of a science-fiction film? The Starkiller Base is a result of poor screenplay writing.So, The Force Awakens offers nothing new when it comes to plot and characters. It also offers nothing new when it comes to fashion or technology. Almost everything in The Force Awakens is something that we've seen in Star Wars films by George Lucas.In short, The Force Awakens is a cash grab. It's not original. It's not art. It doesn't feel epic like the other Star Wars films. It's just a corporate product that was made to play it safe, to appeal to ""fans"", and to earn as much money as possible. It's just mind-numbing.Well, there you have it. There are many more reasons why The Force Awakens is such a bad film. It's even worse than the Star Trek films that J. J. Abrams directed. The latest trailer does make Star Wars: The Last Jedi look somewhat promising. Rian Johnson probably made a much better film than The Force Awakens. But I won't be seeing it in a theater because The Force Awakens left such a bad taste. I'll be boycotting The Last Jedi just like I boycotted Rogue One (2016).What can I say? Thanks to The Force Awakens, the prequel trilogy that George Lucas directed doesn't seem so bad now. At least the prequels have some originality. Even that romance that was played out by Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman doesn't seem so bad now. By the way, I once read that Portman strives to keep a good image as an actress by not appearing in trashy movies. That's admirable, I thought, especially when compared to other Hollywood actresses. But, as it turns out, according to a gossip website, even she appeared in at least one movie without every item of clothing on her. I haven't seen Hotel Chevalier (2007), which is what that amusing cartoon that I posted earlier about, but I have seen The Darjeeling Limited (2007). I've seen it so long ago that I can't remember what happened in it, but I did include it on my list of the ten best movies of 2007.So, The Force Awakens is truly awful. But I'll mention that there's another film that's even more painful to watch. It's Casual Sex? from 1988. I'll admit that I like watching Hollywood films from the 1980s. Even the bad films from that decade don't seem so bad when compared to many modern films. So, what can go wrong? But Casual Sex? is so dull that it took me about a month to finish watching it. Sometimes, I watched it several seconds at a time. It felt like a chore. It's very dull. It stars Lea Thompson and Victoria Jackson, but there's nothing original about this film, and nothing interesting happens in it. If you'd like to get tortured, watch this film."
" One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,10,"I usually don't do reviews but there is an overwhelming amount of bad reviews of people who obviously have too much time to write books about how bad they thought this movie was, but in my opinion they don't do this film justice by giving it these bad reviews.But everyone is entitled to his or her opinion. I think there is a difference between not liking a movie subjectively and to simply just trashing it because of it. And I think that doth not make a review at all. It is just hateful for personal reasons.J.J Abrams, Disney aside, has realized a movie that is not only aesthetically beautiful but also the characters, the story-telling, the build-up of the characters is in many ways what I wanted to see after the debacle of episodes 1-3, aside the great performances by Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor.With its anamorph film look, going back to the old movies with the many humorous moments between the characters, the gorgeous film stills, the characters we love such as Han Solo, Chewbacca and great new characters such as Ray, Finn a.s.o.Of course there are some things that could have been done better. There is basically always something that can be done better in every movie. Also in episodes 4-6, except if you are blinded by your nostalgia fandom of the old movies. The old movies are great and are a true pinnacle of sci-fi movies and a true inspiration for so many movies that could not have been possible without them.I watched this movie without trying to compare it to the old ones, I mean seriously how could you compare it. They were made a few decades ago.I think this movie is great and I am eager to see how the story unfolds."
" The Force Goes to Sleep, and makes a Mindless Clone Copy
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,6,"I enjoyed taking my son to see this, as we are both avid Star Wars fans, but it was NOT what I expected, and I am still let down by it.This movie has almost NOTHING new, and is a complete carbon copy of A New Hope, but with some new young stars. This made it very boring for me as a fan. Kids loved it, but I was hoping for a lot more than a lazy rehash of episode 4 in brighter colors/effects.Also, another major letdown was the characters. Kylo Wren SUCKS!!! SUCKS!!! SUCKS!!! SUCKS!!! SUCKS!!!! Did I mention that Kylo Wren ABSOLUTELY SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!???!?!?!?!?!?!He seemed like a cool character(especially by holding that laser bolt with the force in the intro killings), and had the same appeal of Vader for a while. Then, they did the absolute worst thing they could do= committed the cardinal sin of unmasking the biggest villain/monster/creature/killer in his first outing, before the film is nearly over. You should almost NEVER do this, unless you want to bore the audience and destroy any suspense or imagination about what lies beneath. We find out that Wren is a sissy punk with a baby face that looks like your nerdy lab partner in 10th grade! Why the hell did they go with this guy as Wren? This is the same abysmal choice they made with Hayden Christiansen's CRAPPY acting and persona in the prequels. God, was that bad!! ""Sand is coarse. blah blah blah."" Then Natalie Portman's ""Oh Annie"". Nothing says bad ass Vader like ""Oh Annie!!"" -- I thought I was watching the Broadway musical with the red-headed orphan and Daddy Warbucks.Wren's character sucks, and the cheesy reunion of Han and Leah and the missing links/questions about Rey were just odd to me. I sort of enjoyed the boarding of the Falcon scene with the loosed creatures, but there is a lot of dumb crap in this film that did not satisfy old school SW fans.Then Han is killed by Baby Face Nelson, with no real motivation or explanation, and now Carrie Fisher is dead in real life, so some of our faves are pretty much done. We don't find Luke until his ugly mug is discovered in the final moments of the film, and I just didn't care for Rey at all. The black stormtrooper kid is OK, but we are introduced to his superior officer(who seems cool), but like Boba Fett, is given nothing else to do or work with. I would say I don't know why they remade A New Hope and lied about it, but I know the answer= keep stringing kids and parents and fans along with the same tripe, until you can milk every dime out of audiences without working hard, until they threaten to leave the series, and then we will get back to work. Also, Disney taking this over made me want to puke and throw lightsabers through the wall."
" I Guess I Am Tired Of All These Reboots
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,1,"Ghostbusters, Robocop, Total Recall, bla bla bla I guess I am tired of all of these remakes.This one was particularly insulting because it was remade for the preteen and younger crowd, you know, the type that watches Disney princesses dance and sing and float around. Disney just wants to capture a new audience for the next 10 remakes and offshoots.At least they got JJ Abrams. Then everyone knows it is unoriginal and a remake."

There are three very critical reasons why it is better than the original:1) Better effects - Obviously the effects are going to surpass the original because of the time difference.2) Better plot - In the original, the plot was......fine, but this one brings a whole new level of greatness 3) The New Jedi - Not going to say who it is, but I love this person a lot!All in all, I would definitely recommend watching this amazing movie!!!"

",2017-10-08 00:00:00,10,"I know this, among many other reviews, will just find themselves lost in translation with thousands of others. But that wont deter me from conveying how simply awesome this movie was. It was truly a Star Wars movie. To have just enough fresh material meshed so fluidly with the old stuff everyone loves is a truly amazing feat.I've read countless reviews that say this movie has lost all heart and doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie and the answer to that is simply........wrong.From glorious dogfights to scene stealing droids to gritty lightsaber battles this movie has everything I want in a Star Wars film. And more! There are some real moments of raw emotion too that I think the Prequels tried to instill but just couldn't.The plot is perfection, the new characters had perfect chemistry with the old, the effects were even more mind blowing than the trailers led to me believe, etc etc etc Please don't even bother reading any laughable negative reviews, simply see this spectacle for yourself.10"

" All Real Star Wars fans loved it, and clearly so did the average viewer. The inarguable facts (AKA the record-breaking box office) speaks for itself ; )
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,10,"Before watching The Force Awakens, I was slightly skeptical. However, I can safely say I am now a HUGE fan of the Star Wars universe!The Force Awakens stands as a rock-solid foundation of a promising trilogy, which will easily surpass the original trilogy if this incredibly high standard of film making is carried forward.Clearly J.J. Abrams enjoyed every minute of work when directing this movie, and he expresses his love for the Star Wars franchise extremely well by respecting the original material and cleverly linking the trilogies and simultaneously building new, strong characters who rival even the classics such as Han or Luke. Overall, I would say that TFA is a must-see movie, not only for fans of the Star Wars franchise, but for anyone who has access to a television screen. J.J Abrams does an absolutely masterful job at showing his love and passion for Star Wars, and the finished products (Yay Episode 9!!!!) will all go down in history as some of the greatest films of any trilogy in history."
" Lackluster
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,5,"I was looking forward to a relaunch of the Star Wars franchise with episode 7 and I was interested in how Disney would go about it. Unfortunately they played it very safe with the plot as it was pretty much a remake of episode 4. Otherwise the story line was FULL of plot holes and some really cringe worthy dialogue. Beside the plot holes, the 'baddies' were you typical highly inept idiots we all came to expect, begging the question of how they even made it into a position of power in the first place. If you are a fan of the franchise you will watch it just, because it is Star Wars and it has some decent scenes, but it leaves a lot to be desired. Besides the rehashed story line, the inclusion of SJW elements to the franchise seemed forced.Overall I found this to be the weakest episode in the franchise and a fairly poor showing. At least episode 1 (for all its flaws) had an original story line."
" The Force Awakens
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,7,"The Force Awakens is the Seventh Star Wars film directed by J.J. Abrams and stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, and Harrison Ford. The film was mass distributed by the Disney Corporation and produced by Lucasfilm, being labeled as a Sci-Fi Action Adventure. I actually own the film and would be glad to document my opinions and observations just for you. The Force Awakens is set a full generation after the events in Return of the Jedi. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a lonely scavenger selling for scraps for a living on Jakku. On the other side of powers, Finn (John Boyega) is a storm-trooper looking to escape from the First Order with the help of Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Their fates coerce and try to take on the First Order run by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Characters in The Force Awakens are mostly good ones. You can call Rey a ""Mary Sue"", but Daisy's performance really makes up for what could be an underwritten character. The movie has a lot of characters and is a lot of fun but they don't balance out easily. Some like Captain Phasma look interesting, but she does next to nothing in terms of plot and character development. But overall, most of the performances are great and give the film a lot of levity, unlike *Cough* Rogue One *Cough*.There was a lot I liked here. There is a lot of grand set pieces that really give the film huge scale. Even the visual effects by ILM looked amazing as well. And overall, The Force Awakens is a huge amount of fun. The plot is a rehash of A New Hope, but as they say ""If it isn't broke, don't fix it"", even if there are elements of Empire thrown in. Themes of The Force Awakens include Family, Fate, and Coincidence. Since Rey has the Force, it is only known that she should discover the full extent of her powers, which is implied at the end. Family plays a big role in the Star Wars universe. And this trend continues with Han and Leia's son being the leader of The First Order.This film has reached more than a seventh of the world. It has most certainly found its audiences. General audiences would like this film. Star Wars fans certainly would. Depending on how you see the plot, it could go any way."
" Déjà vu
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,5,"After watching the film and discussing it with my brother, he pointed out that the plot was similar to A New Hope. Upon further inspection, it is essentially just the same as A New Hope, aside from the cast and characters. I admit, some things did seem different and/or new, but it generally did not meet expectations, and felt familiar. Taking influence is one thing, but this is essentially the film version of plagiarism, but in a lesser form.Nevertheless, the film had good points. It had a few minor characters and extras which make the Star Wars universe feel larger, like the original trilogy did with Mos Eisley and Jabba's Palace. Some memorable characters, like FN-2199.Despite the universe expansion, it just seems like an example of a franchise which is too good, it should left alone. J.J. Abrams might not have been the best choice for the film."
" Worst Disney princess ever
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,1,"I honestly tried to watch the remake of A New Hope until the conclusion, but I could not (and I am sorry for the time spent on watching this reboot).This Hollywood device insults the moniker of one of the best films in the history of the science fiction and film. Compare it to the films it copies and steals the name of and you will see they have nothing in common whatsoever.Typically when people note an acclaimed film name or moniker they would want to enjoy something good to excellent. This is very boring, uninteresting, has no character development and has too many Disney one-liners and wise cracks. However, since from the first second of watching through to the end credits we find nothing of consequence or interest this is a typical case of cashing in, tricking audiences and insulting Star Wars. Really bad is that the force is there for the taking and requires no age limit or training. You just have to be a Disney princess (but didn't Disney princesses used to be pretty??).I give 1 Star only because IMDb forces me to, but agree with the rest of the universe that this reboot is not actually Star Wars."
" Yes, it really is that good.
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie does everything right. Right from the start, I was sucked into the story. There are so many ways this could have gone wrong, and I'm so glad they did it right.I was afraid that perhaps the new characters would not grow on me, but fortunately that wasn't the case. Finn's role is just perfect, plus it allows the movie to give the audience more insight into the structure of the empire, and what being a Storm Trooper is all about. This is the world building I was talking about earlier. The movie answers a lot of questions, even the simple ones. Rey is also a great character, but the exact opposite of Finn. Plus I really enjoyed the way the movie dispels common damsel in distress tropes with her. I think Rey's character makes the Star Wars universe more accessible to a young female audience, and that thought makes me smile a little. The movie does its best to show us that Rey is perfectly fine at saving herself.The opening shot of the original Star Wars had its audience literally ducking in their seats, and thus succeeded at making you feel the oppressive rule of the empire with a mere visual. But The Force Awakens nails that too. Rather than steal those shots, they have new shots to achieve the same thing. A lot of the shots of imperial ships are shot at an angle from below, so they look really big.The special effects in this are also amazing. There is so much use of real sets and practical effects. Tons of creatures are puppets, animatronics, or suit- characters. -Even some of the really big creatures are puppets, I suspect. This makes the world look real. Sure, when it comes to big battle scenes there is also liberal use of CGI. I also really like the way they show the interior of various ships, and show how the technology works. It makes it all feel real.Plot wise, the movie succeeds at making the First Order feel threatening, by showing the cruelty of the empire early on. This is something that the old movies never really succeeded at. They always made the Storm Troopers look like bumbling cannon fodder, -but not so in this movie. They also have some fun with the villain, which is welcome. He isn't just some two dimensional character.Another thing that surprised me, is how they expand on the lore of The Force. We get to see new ways in which the Force can be used, and they focus more on the mystical elements of it, and don't even mention the midichlorians from the prequels. And we get to see the Force being used a lot. If you think about it, Darth Vader didn't use the Force all that much in the original trilogy, and neither did Obi Wan. But in the Force Awakens, we see liberal use of it.If you have children you owe it to them to take them to this movie. I mean it. Take them to this movie right now! They will love you for it! Come on! And if you are still a child at heart, then go see it as well."
" Ignore negative, neckbeardy, contrarian reviews. The Force is strong with this awesome movie!
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,10,"This is a great movie. It's also an extremely popular and mainstream movie, and therefore is going to bring out raging nerds that will needlessly nitpick it to death in an attempt to look smart or edgy. There are legitimate criticisms you can hurl at this or any movie, but people that give it a 1 or 2 out of 10 shouldn't be taken remotely seriously, as they are completely ignoring what the movie did right, and putting a magnifying glass over the irrelevant level of minor flaws included. Normal Star Wars fans will find a lot to like hear. Great set pieces/locations, excellent costume design, flawed and relatable characters, hilarious banter/quips, dramatic and complex relationships, and a ton of space adventure fun!It's the best Star Wars film since Empire, hands down."
" Beyond Incredible! (Especially Compared To The Laughably Overrated Originals)
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,10,"My expectations were very, very high for this movie.Starting with the opening scene, a typical Star Wars opening, I wondered how well it was done. I wondered how it would be different and yet new, rebooting some of the old and original without seeming stagnant.JJ delivered on the Star Trek reboot and he absolutely nailed this one as well.He made it his own movie, he engaged original characters by engaging the new and the old. He let the characters tell their own stories without pushing over the boundaries. The story flowed.John Williams does it again. Harrison Ford was spectacular. The newcomers were fun, engaging and ""cheer"" worthy.My only complaint is this: do I really have to wait 2 more years to see the next amazing one directed by Abrams?!Someone pass me the Xanax while I wait, please!!!"
" Worst Star Wars yet
",2017-09-21 00:00:00,3,What I like1. Han Solo's death was legendary and meme worthy2. Finn and Rey were pretty fun to watch their banter go across3. Kylo Ren was pretty cool the first thirty minutes or so of the filmWhat I hated1. Kylo Ren was a terrible villain in the last parts of the movie2. Snoke was the most useless villain ever3. Phasma literally did zero things4. Poe was underused as well5. Luke's gross robot hand6. Carrie Fishers and Harrison Ford's god awful acting7. The story is literally a repeat8. How did the first order build itself to be stronger than the senate in 3 decadesOverall this was a failure and the worst one in the series. While I liked some stuff it is over thrown by everything terrible. At least the prequels has a story. This did not
" I Give This Reboot 10 out of 10 out of 10 out of 10
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,1,"Which is 0.01 out of 10... and that is because I am generous.As far as reboots go this horrible and reboots are horrible by nature.They got the story of A New Hope and force PC's it with a girl who flies spaceships having never even owned a car. Then there is a sewer scrubber on duty to retrieve a plan in a droid.. yeah blabla it is all A New Hope bastardized. Who cares, right?By the way, they got these actors on the very cheap but surely there are better actors out there in amateur land!Finally, this whole Star Wars thing has become such an embarrassment that in the last week one director quit and another one would not accept the job (literally refused to take the job) and so they went back to the bottom0ofthe-barrel Jar Jar Abrams who is always available in exchange for a buck."
" Greatest movie of all time
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,10,"So, my opinion of this movie is that it is the ""greatest movie of all time."" WHY? Let us get started. Number One: This movie is the first one to be in Sphero's ""Watch with me"" features with its BB-8. If you have a BB-8 from Sphero, you get what I mean if you have iPhone 5s or later. Number Two: The music by John Williams is FANTASTIC! I am so mad at the Academy that it did not give John Williams and Oscar for his music!!!!! This movie is his 50th Oscar nomination! WHY THE HELL DID THEY NOT GIVE HIM AN Oscar!?!?!?!??!?!Number Three: The old characters finally return. Bad news, is that George Lucas is not there to help make it, so that is a bit a problem that does not matter. Number Four: This movie is similar to Star Wars: A New Hope.Number Five: Daisy Ridley's performance as Rey is GREAT! Even though she is not my favorite person, she really got her talent through and she made the production quicker. I agree with some people that she is fun to watch.Those are the five main reasons why this movie is the greatest movie of all time. May the force be with The Force Awakens."
" A Sign Of Hollywood Bankruptcy In General And Disney In Particular
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,1,"Who would hire JJ Abrams to direct Star Wars? A pickpocket that steals from the audience and stabs them in the front.Now universally derided as Jar Jar Abrams, although clearly Disney and its mercenary have managed to make the prequels look good in comparison, the director with so little originality, narrative capability, care for character development or pacing understanding is simply the worst example of Hollywood mistaking money, cash, incomes, earning per share with movie making. They often say it is called the movie business. As offensive and cynical as that statement is to begin with, Disney and Jar Jar have eliminated the 'movie' portion completely and just made Star Wars a frontal business by lifting and shifting the script for A New Hope, inserting (an ugly and useless) Princess for Luke and voila we have The Force Reawakens or whatever this thing is called because it is all inconsequential.Poor actors, no script, poorest director and Disney laughs at Star Wars, its fans and the people who pay to watch it.Well, I did too, but will not ever again."

Evidence of this is by the wonderful cast of familiar and new characters, particular stand outs are Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. The action was great, the story worked wonders. J.J added his genius, unique touch. As he did with Star Trek 2009 + Into Darkness.It did a wonderful job bridging the gap to a new story. Practical effects were 10/10. The older fans are just butthurt that more people are exposed to a new generation of incredible/better movies.

The directing was amazing, to the point where you're so immersed in the scenes, I actually felt giddy during some of the flight scenes, it feels like you're actually IN the ship. The special effects are tastefully done, and are a perfect follow on from its predecessors. Nostalgia rules in this thrilling film, we felt like applauding several times throughout, and got goosebumps in some amazing scenes. It was also surprisingly humorous, (in appropriate amounts), and the balance of new characters versus returning characters and story lines was brilliant. 10 out of 10 for me!"

",2017-09-15 00:00:00,9,"This movie is the perfect way to introduce Star Wars to a generation that was almost plagued with nothing but those god awful prequels.The characters are likable, the story is similar but with a fresh new take, and it pays homage to the original trilogy by mixing in ideas from the first three movies and combining them into this visual masterpiece. Personally, there is only one problem I have with this movie, the rathar chase. But even that I didn't have too much of a problem with.Overall Star Wars: The Force Awakens is one of the best if not the best movie released in 2015, here's hoping The Last Jedi continues this trend"
" The Triumphant Return of the Star Wars Saga
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,9,"In October of 2012, almost five years ago next month, there was an announcement made in regards to Star Wars. George Lucas, the visionary creator of the Star Wars universe, struck a deal with Disney where they would acquire Lucasfilm for around $4.05 billion and that there would be a new Star Wars movie set to be released in 2015. This brought an immense amount of joy and excitement to me as a life-long Star Wars fanatic! For the first time in over ten years, I would be able to see a new Star Wars film on the big screen! From late 2012-early 2013 to several days before it's December 2015 release, I read as many articles I could about pre-production, production, what the movie would actually be about, whether or not material from the Expanded Universe would be the basis for the next trilogy, etc. With that being said, here is my review of the first movie of the sequel trilogy, The Force Awakens. Directed by JJ Abrams (""Star Trek"" 2009), this seventh entry of the Star Wars saga is set thirty years after the Battle of Endor and the defeat of the evil Galactic Empire in Return of Jedi, the galaxy has undergone significant changes. While several of our favorite characters from the original trilogy we grew up knowing and loving such as Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), and C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) all return, a new generation of heroes and villains are introduced in this episode such as Rey (Daisy Ridley) a scavenger from the planet Jakku (which is very similar to Tatooine with it's desert-like climate), Finn (John Boyega) a former First Order Storm Trooper turned ally of the Resistance, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) commander of the Resistance starfighters, BB-8, an astromech droid similar to R2, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) Sith Lord in training under Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), and Captain Phasma (Gwendoline Christie) commander of the First Order of Storm Troopers. In this film, the conflict is centered around the Resistance of the New Republic, (led by General Leia Organa) waging war with the First Order, a legion of Storm Troopers risen from the remaining ashes of the fallen Galactic Empire. In the midst of all of the widespread galactic conflict and turmoil, Leia is also seeking to find her long lost brother, Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, (our hero and main protagonist from the original trilogy that redeemed his father, Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader by bringing him back to the light side and reestablishing balance to the force, fulfilling the prophecy of Anakin/Vader being ""The Chosen One"") who mysteriously went into hiding not long after the events of ROTJ. While not as good as the original trilogy in terms of story, acting, and character development, it still had several strong elements present in the film. Now, I'm going to give what I liked about the movie and where I think (and hope) they can improve in the next two ST entries starting with The Last Jedi in December. Here's what I thought JJ Abrams did a good job of: Unlike Star Trek where he made a lot of changes to the main characters (which is one of the things I feared the most when I found out that he would be directing TFA), I thought that he did a great job of re-introducing our favorite characters and keeping them the same as they were in the OT, just older. I also liked his use of flashbacks, specifically the scene where Kylo Ren is talking to the decaying mask of his grandfather, Darth Vader, by making the claim that as a (future) Sith Lord and leader of the First Order, he will finish what he started with the Galactic Empire. Along with keeping the action consistent throughout the course of the film, I also thought he did a good job of building up the tension towards the climactic showdown at the end. Now, here's what I think they can (and hope) improve on in the next two films: While we all know the backstories of our returning heroes from the OT, the character development was a bit lacking in the new characters introduced in TFA. Rey is basically a ""Mary Sue"" like character (think Wesley Crusher from Star Trek: TNG) in that she's basically presented as being perfect, all strengths and no weaknesses. This frustrated me to no end in one scene where Kylo Ren basically did as he wanted with her blaster when he used the Force on her but, in her duel against him during the film's climax, claiming to have had no Jedi training, they portray her as a ""great"" wielder of the Force that is (somehow) able to defeat him! How does this make sense??? I also hope they flesh out more of Finn and Poe's backstories and I really hope they show more of Captain Phasma in the next movies. I firmly believe she has the potential to be an iconic character in the vein of Darth Maul and Boba Fett. I also hope they cash in on the opportunity they have with Kylo Ren by making him the next great and powerful Sith Lord as he continues to complete his training with Snoke. All of that aside, it was an enjoyable film for me and I can't wait to see how great The Last Jedi will be!!! Rating: 9/10!!!"
" A New Hope steeped in political correctness
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,6,"As a fan of the original trilogy, I was looking forward to this new Star Wars mooted as a nod to the original trilogy. George Lucas arguably lost his way with the prequels, and perhaps J.J. Abrams could find it again?But what we're served is really a rehash of New Hope steeped in the political correctness that is so prevalent in today's society. On a positive note, Abrams doesn't do a bad job of recreating the ""used universe"" that made Star Wars such a classic. CGI cartoon-like nonsense does make the odd appearance, but it's not overpowering. The look of the movie is excellent. It's the narrative that leaves a sour taste in your mouth.The liberal agenda weakened this film is several ways. Firstly, Abrams felt it necessary to portray the prime bad guy, Kylo Ren well played by Adam Driver, as an inadequate figure of fun. He is unmasked in this first instalment of the new trilogy, removing all mystery and menace from the character, and comes across as an insecure teenage bully boy trying too hard to appear evil.Secondly, the female star of the film of course had to be a superhuman fighter and dominant. Daisy Ridley does good work here as Rey with the material she was given. But the agenda is strong in Abrams, and Disney. If young girls view Rey as a role model, they might get a rude awakening when they try to beat up three men with a stick. The lack of realism here again damages the storyline.In another scene, Rey is ""empowered"" when asking Finn (another male figure of fun John Boyega) for the correct sealing tape. It's hammered home she has the technical and mechanical knowledge, not the male. It is possible to write a strong female character without straying too far from real world gender differences (I know, I know, we're all the same now). Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia was a very strong female lead, but she never lost her femininity. An interesting side note is all merchandise showing Leia in her slave outfit is now blacklisted by Disney, as if it gave the message that was her true role in life. I don't believe that's a message most normal people got. Quite the opposite. But this is the narrative Disney lives and breathes now. Woman strong & technical, man weak & comical.Rey's toughness is hammered home so hard in fact, that it becomes quickly tedious. ""I can handle myself"" she says to Han Solo, after recently outsmarting him by fixing the Millennium Falcon when he couldn't. We get the message Disney. Yawn.And thirdly, black stormtrooper John Boyega has a crisis of conscience and decides to escape the Empire. As with the ""tormented teen"" Kylo Ren, this only damages the Empire's menace and thus makes the movie unstable. Seeing a stormtrooper worry about firing his gun does nothing to strengthen the franchise. Maybe we'll see a stormtrooper petting a puppy in future instalments?In conclusion? We may remember New Hope as a child's movie, with a fairy tale Princess and cliché evil overlord. But it was surprisingly adult friendly. Originally Han Solo did indeed shoot Greedo first, not in self defense as in later altered PC versions. And Darth Vader wasn't a spotty teenager to be laughed at. Princess Leia was tough as hell, but in a believable and feminine way. In contrast Force Awakens is strictly a young child's movie, ticking all the politically correct boxes in a righteous Disney mission to empower women and prove that men are incompetent. Maybe the prequels weren't so bad after all?"
" Hypocritical much?
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,1,"They kill the force and make it something like 'intuition' or 'will power' and then call this film The Force Awakens.What is next? Calling JJ Abrams original or calling Bad Robot artsy?? This reboot is dismal.A person once said it best in one of the previous reviews: ""As far as I am concerned ... I see zero need to spite and insult those who are Star Wars fans or want a film that is respectable. While projecting a so-called big budget film in a fun and action-packed film the force awakens is definitely silly and childish.The acting is the worst part of it and these rank amateurs are already hated. Yet this remake is so hypocritical that it is difficult to imagine how anyone can take its existence seriously.Below all its elementary language, this is a tale of an anti-Star Wars pusher who steals money from the unsuspecting attendees and their children with nary a care.If anyone wants a quality-written sci-fi with universal implications instead of this very cynical copying drivel then watch the originals or look at a list of good sci-fil films... and this won't be on it."
" Mediocre, a new hope rehashed.
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,2,"OK so where do I begin. Firstly people that have given this a positive review are obviously biast Star Wars fans who would enjoy anything with the name Star Wars on it but unfortunately you need to review it as a movie. Don't get me wrong it was OK but I agree with a lot of the negative reviews here, that it is basically a rehash of a New Hope. It was as if the director was too scared too come up with new original ideas. As bad as the prequels were at least they were original! We also got really cool stuff from the prequels, for example, pod racing, darth maul, duel of the fates, clone wars, young yoda, anakin turning evil and the jedi council. But this movie has basically copied new hope, I thought Rogue one was a better movie because at least they took a risk although most of that film was a little too bland, the ending of that film was amazing. But anyway very disappointed with this, I wanted to see something different and also the actress who plays Rey was soooooo wooden. Also Disney do we need a Han solo movie, why not give us a boba fett movie or a movie on the old republic. I wish Disney knew which direction to take Star Wars but unfortunately they don't. I hope they bring out a movie to prove me wrong."
" This is Anti-Star Wars - Boycott
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,1,"After watching every Star Wars and now watching the reboot, The Force Awakens I can say this was a complete disappointment, and the clear proof that how things are being done at Disney: reasonable contacts, speaking gibberish and making the movie-attending public believe they are smarter than they actually are because the they can get a way with a copy/paste script.From the very start of The Force Awakens there was many things that didn't add up, but we let them go because we Star Wars fans. ironically, for such a title, the force is completely absent and snoozing and is almost like some kind of a trick that is everywhere and with everyone and can be picked up and run with.I assume this film was made by a computer cut, copy, paste, reedit process using old scripts and input from a consulting film. The worst films are made by committee. Disney's sabotages to the Star Wars legacy don't make much sense because they own the ""franchise"" (hate it when Disney employees use this word so corporate), but they have no choice without talent. JJ Abrams keeps ripping off and remaking films and he is an embarrassment. He is just a one-dimensional creation of the bank account, a square lover of power and position who can be compared to a film sith - as always happens with directors who dislike art and tradition and love and caring - who history will ultimately prove wrong in almost everything he does. Things get worse as the film continues starting with the time-lapse, lack of continuity and the one-dimensional so-called acting.While the film initially garnered critical (payola?) acclaim, viewers left in droves and by now it is famously considered an embarrassment par excellence. Those who remain for this film could be bad Robot contractors and of course deriders of Star Wars.The death of Star Wars came in 2015, continued in 2016 and Disney will not stop now, but our giving it cash will."
" First Star Wars since 1980 that didn't suck!
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,10,"Don't mistake continuity of story and universe with ""reboot or rehash"" - This is a story that continues on from the end of Return of the Jedi"". We are not worried about The Force being explained anymore, we don't care - It's a mystery and back to being a mystery. It starts with a simple enough premise: The Empire was defeated and their end Death Star obliterated, but as always, in fiction as in true life, when old bad guys are killed off, new bad guys take their place.This is not a universe that is ""in the same condition as it was in Eps IV, V, and VI"" - As there is a new republic, there is also a new group of imperialists and fascists that want to tear it down. It's happening in the US this very day, so this is nothing new.The main thing here is ""Where is Luke Skywalker"" - And both bad guys and good guys want to know the answer to this. So do We. These include some of the old regulars, plus a new bad guy who wears a Helmet that looks like the Ugly Narc-Alien from Episode IV, who narced on Hans Solo to Imperial Storm Troopers and particularly Jabba the Hut. In an early confrontation in this episode, this duck faced guy takes out Max Von Sydow who indicates this person came from the Good side of the Force.So to me it's just continuity, as there are Jedi who followed Luke and his mentor Obi-Wan, any new recruit that goes down the Dark Side ends up doing Darth Vaderish things, like killing Off a whole school of Jedi Kids.As in life with often repeated scenarios, that keep on repeating over and over, this is just the same in the Star Wars universe. I'm not worried about that, what's important here is ""Does this film play out like original Star Wars""? And yes, it does.And although this film includes people from Eps 4, 5, and 6, this is a new story, and so there are two new players, a girl, who is waiting on a crummy sand planet, and a storm trooper, who turns away from his programming because he wants something better. And there is something about this Kid, do we know *his* father?The imagery is pure original Star Wars. The gadgets, the Droids, the Crashed Imperial Destroyers. New and Old Aliens, in new and old Bars.I very much wanted to know who this girl was, and I very much wanted to know about this kid who walked away from being a storm trooper. In the Meantime, it was great to see Han, Chewie, and Leia, who have scars of age and experience. At one time, they were the young ones who had the responsibility laid on them, in this episode, it is the girl and the boy. Because in real life it is always the young choosing to do good, who have long term effects, who save Nations in some cases. It's generational, the old guard passes it on the the new guard. If you live in this world, you're feeling the change of the guard - As the old song says.That's what this episode is, although there is a major victory, it is at major cost. And although the old Empire had built two powerful Death Stars, those were nothing compared to a new threat. It's a death star on steroids. So some ask, why make new Death Stars? Why have one in this movie? Because, it's the limited thinking of The Imperialists and Fascists. Because they always go back to comfortable norms for weapons design- In their Supreme Leader's small thinking, another huge planet sized weapon with a huge GUN.I saw this in IMax, in 3D, and I was impressed with how each 3D gag was well thought out and well placed. My brother kept trying to reach out and touch the tip of the Imperial Destroyer. A film shot in 3D has to look good also in 2D, and this does, in the IMax theater I could occasionally pull off my glasses and see a 2D Scene, and the composition in 2D was just as good. I'm not really a fan of 3D films, you can't really call them films anymore, as they are made on all digital medium. But for this episode, it worked well.In Lucas's overblown Eps I II and III, the CGI was over the top and blatantly CGI. IN this film, the CGI blends with the practical elements so that you absolutely cannot tell which is which. And also in Eps I II and III we have a multitude of scenes which are boring discussions explaining the force, mainly people sitting on couches talking. That, to me is about exciting as eating a plate of Tripe! I guarantee you, you will NOT see any Jedi sitting on couches talking in this one. Or Senators, or Sith Lords. This film is action from start to finish- about 2 and a half hours worth.And after walking out after the last scene and the film credits, there is no way in hades or Tattoine, that this will not have sequels. And this episode deserves to have sequels. And I for one cannot wait for those to come out!"
" Very Blah Remake
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,1,"This new remake by Disney and JJ Abrams (now universally called Jar Abrams) is quite horrid and quite inferior from the installments that came before it. It is frightening that something could be worse than the prequels but Disney and its accounting cash bag man have done it! Boring, very uninspired, VERY plagiaristic (literally they swapped a good actor with a bad one and just made the new one female). She looked so much like she is having a ball prancing around to the old script.The difference in acting quality was very striking. They even needed to bring an old actor back via CGI and the guy is dead in real life! This is one of the worst ways to spend an evening. I suggest you watch paint dry."
" Star Wars fans win again
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,10,"I don't need to pathetically hyper analyze it to love it. It was brilliant from start to finish. Unlike the godawful Lord of the Rings films, which are completely unwatchable. I really loved the movie, can't wait to watch it again. I wasn't sure what JJ Abrams would do with the film but he has been unbelievably great for the franchise. It gets really emotional at times and is just an absolute pleasure to watch. It felt like it was 1980 again. It's great to see this franchise resurrected and it was a beautifully natural continuation that delivered in spades! #TYJJ"
" Best Star Wars Yet - which will please both virgins and vets.
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,10,"How do you please franchise fans old and new while making a good, impactful and memorable movie? Do exactly what JJ Abrams did here, to a tee. My friends, real fans who grew up with the original trilogy and watched this one with me, expressed a physically relief of feeling there was very little to complain about and that ""'they' didn't mess it up"", but my feeling was even more positive. They exceeded my high expectations, brought me into a mysterious and magical voyage and left me wanting more until the last frame. A real cinematic experience.Star Wars formula could be deemed to appeal to simplicity (like good vs evil) with a few twists. Fun fact and contingent to the same doctrine, the majority of its meaningful characters name limit themselves to 3 or 4 letters: Han, Luke, Leia, Yoda and now Rey, Poe and Finn. If not letters, we can substitute numbers: R2D2, C3PO or BB8.Well, we can now focus on 2 letters: JJ. JJ Abrams directs and co-writes this brilliant installment in the multi-billion dollar franchise which set ridiculous revenues after a record-breaking first day (not counting merchandise and video sales)It also comes with extremely favourable critics and has started an epic new trilogy as well as spin-offs we all hope will continue to remain a high level of quality such as Rogue One already did incredibly. But back to this highly anticipated sequel which manages to create nostalgic moments with its characters, settings and story. Every Star Wars Fans will enjoy the scenery of a defunct Star Destroyer in the desert, but overall cinematography and scenery is in fact the best of all the Star Wars by its beauty and diversity. We get sultry desert in Jakku like Tatooine and forest like Endor. We get beautiful snow that surpass Hoth, buildings and water like Naboo and idyllic Irish-like islands. Daniel Mindel is the cinematographer who also did marvels with JJ on the first 2 Star Trek reboots. Every battle scene is sweeping and spectacular with many elements, motion and emotion. Humour is effective and tension is well crafted and augmented by sound, music and editing.Here Abrams outdoes himself by keeping it crisp with new likable and believable characters, great acting and superb directing to keep everything flowing and fans following. We feel for the characters, old and new. We are intrigued and we do not want it to end. A pretty much perfect movie of the genre and for a new generation, with Rey a particular stand-out.Han and Leia were not only there for older fans, but make it work as very important elements to the story. The writing and directing for them is just right, like the rest of the movie. Award-worthy, action-packed, well-paced, high expectations delivered and then some.It's decisively the best Star Wars yet, and that is no small feat. One small step for a fan, but a giant leap for longevity and quality!Rian Johnson has some SERIOUS shoes to fill for Episode 8.10/10"
" Is this the best Star Wars movie ever? Ummmmm Is the sky blue? Exactly.
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,10,"I was absolutely sure this was going to be an epic failure after the horrible taste the prequels left us with. I watched the prequels before watching the movie. They were even worse than I remembered them. Atrocious. Unwatchable. The best thing that could ever happen was Disney getting Lucasfilm off George Lucas' hands. George Lucas, thank you for not being involved AT ALL in this movie. You almost destroyed Star Wars with the ""prequels"".But JJ Abrams and Disney... they created a masterpiece. This is movie is so stunning on so many levels I can only compare it to when I was 3 years old and watched Star Wars in a huge movie theater. Goosebumps, chills, the whole deal. This movie feels real, looks real, just like the original trilogy did. This is amazing - I couldn't imagine Disney topping the original trilogy - but in my humble opinion, they did.Disney, JJ Abrams, everyone involved - feel proud about yourselves. You made me forget the prequels ever existed, and made me feel like a 3 year old kid for two hours. Hope the same writers are involved with Episode 8 and find a way to mention that the prequels were ""some sort of mythology that never happened"", then i'll be a happy, true Star Wars fan!t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-TEN!"

",2017-09-10 00:00:00,10,"JJ Abrams did a spectacular job of bringing back Star Wars. I still need watch it again so I can analyze the entire thing and not be completely engrossed (going to be hard to do) in the movie throughout the time I was watching it. The Force Awakens is a masterpiece, period. Rey is the first female lead character in any movie that I truly love with no faults. Daisy Ridley hit it out of the park. Harrison Ford also did a solid job. It was hard not to like Poe or Finn because of their intrinsic qualities. Kylo Ren was an astounding villain with so much rage, uncertainty, and raw power in the force. The movie was a great watch, I'd probably say it's a 9/10 to non Star Wars fans and a 10/10 for ALL Star Wars fans everywhere. They left a lot of things to look forward to in the next film and I simply cannot wait for December 2017 to roll around!!!"

",2017-09-07 00:00:00,1,"Jar Jar Abrams sucks.Some films are made bad (Plan 9 From Outer Space) but are actually fascinating. Some big budget films (Independence Day Resurgence) suck, but you can watch it somewhat. Then we have the reboot of A New Hope. A bad film, with bad sad sacks of actors, bad premise (the villains are like children playing costume party) awful characters (the emo dude keeps taking his mask off why have it??) so you know he is a kid with bad hair and daddy issues and bad directing and script (they just rehashed the first one but badly). The Plot? This is written by the Disney treasury department shortly and handed to money man JJ Abrams.The scenes jump from location to location, mega plot holes, terrible logic and bad actors hired on the cheap.However, you should watch it if you want to see that someone who has never seen a light saber before can pick one up and fight anyone he wants with it (i.e. F you to Yoda)"
" I'd rather watch The Star Wars Holiday Special
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,1,"The basic structure of the plot is too similar to A New Hope and far too much time is wasted on fan service. Unfortunately they have made too many unsatisfactory alterations for this film to work as a worthwhile remake.For understandable reasons the film's main protagonist this time is a Disney Princess. This particular alteration could be seen as a clever ploy by the film's creators as it helps to both distract the audience from the obvious parallels with A New Hope while also predisposing liberal critics to give it the benefit of the doubt. Some of the apologists for the film do like to accuse its critics of misogyny. In a similar fashion the presence of the actor who plays Fin and the other ethnic minorities within the film might have also led to a better critical reception than was otherwise deserved. The problem that I have with the Rey character is that she appears to have finished the Hero's Journey before the start of the film. I'm afraid that anyone that tries to insist that Luke was handled the same way by Lucas and co have either not watched the original films or were not paying attention. Luke was initially portrayed as a bumbling ignoramus who was constantly overshadowed by everyone else and particularly by Han. The original three protagonists complemented each other nicely both in their abilities and their relative importance. Rey by contrast not only far overshadows Fin and Poe but is in danger of eclipsing the abilities and achievements of everyone else from the Star Wars Universe.In my opinion the behaviour and temperament of Fin after his sudden crisis of conscience did not make any sense whatsoever. After spending his whole life indoctrinated by the First Order he is instantly transformed into a comedy sidekick for the lead protagonist. And I would probably find the treatment of his character even more problematic if I was black myself. Poe's ability as a pilot is repeatedly emphasized but for some strange reason rather than allow the obvious option of having him pilot the Falcon as the protagonists escape, the script deems it convenient to have him disappear in order to further embellish the amazing incredibility of Rey. If Rey was a man would the filmmakers have felt the same need to repeatedly hammer home the character's awesomeness?The relationship between the three main factions was unnecessarily confusing. Maybe I am being cynical but I got the impression that the third faction was only included so that it could be wiped out by the preposterous Starkiller Base. However, for all the impact that the deaths of billions had on the protagonists or indeed the watching audience they might as well have been swatting flies.Luke's behaviour is seemingly inconsistent with the character that was developed within the previous films and Han looks to be too old to be displaying the symptoms of a midlife crisis by gallivanting around the universe as if he was forty years younger. In order to continue milking this franchise the achievements of the original three protagonists have been destroyed while some of their actions since The Return of the Jedi do not appear to be consistent with what we had learned about them by the end of that film. The fundamental nature of the Force has also had to change to suit the contemporary demand for instant gratification. Why bother indicating that your protagonists are gradually learning new abilities when they can just shut their eyes and master them in an instant? It seems that there was no need for all those Jedi Academies after all."
" A masterful weaving of the old and new
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,10,"Don't let the shrill minority fool you, Star Wars The Force Awakens is one of the greatest films ever set in a galaxy far, far away. J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan have accomplished what I thought to be impossible: they have resurrected the Star Wars franchise with more life and vigor than ever. From a beautiful story to crackling dialogue that doesn't take itself overly serious, this film is brimming with everything we ever loved about Star Wars. The acting is better than we've ever seen it, with our returning cast, specifically Harrison Ford churning out their best performances yet. My favorite part of the film, however, are the new players. All of the young cast, specifically Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley stun in their respective roles. This film plays as a love letter to fans, and while it's impossible to please everyone in the internet age, as a man who loved the original trilogy long before the prequels, I can assure you that if you consider yourself a real Star Wars fan, you will fall in love with this film. I implore you to see it multiple times. It's gotten better every single time. It's now tied with Empire as my favorite Star Wars film. This film will stand the test of time for generations to come. Thank you J.J. and Kasdan for this gem of a trilogy kickoff!"
" Real Star Wars fans got the sequel we always wanted. Therefore (as always) I win......you lose X- )
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,10,"With this absolute epic, Star Wars.....is......back! JJ Abrams achieved a small miracle in creating a movie that respects its original material, brings in a ton of new characters, makes it appealing for new viewers and sets up a story to build a new Star Wars trilogy on. Without giving away too many spoilers, the story revolves around a scavenger (Rey), a renegade stormtrooper(Finn) and a fighter pilot(Poe) in their quest to defeat an enemy with the power to endanger the galaxy. To be honest, actual great acting has never been a strong point in any of the previous Star Wars movies. This trend has thankfully been broken, as the stellar cast give great performances throughout the whole movie. The newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, playing as Rey and Finn respectively, prove themselves more than capable of carrying the load in continuing the saga. They both show great chemistry together and give us extremely likable characters, with Rey bringing the heart of the film and Finn the abundant energy. Oscar Isaacs, who plays Poe, is the veteran among the young cast and pulls of a cool and smart-ass X-wing pilot. And finally, the old cast returns to give this film a true Star Wars feel to it. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo and has not seemed to skip a beat since 1983, as he is as cheeky and bad-ass as ever. His witty banter with Chewbacca is a pleasure to watch, but Ford also brings a strong emotional performance this time too. Carrie Fisher as Leia also returns, in a rather small role, and delivers some sweet scenes with Han and the new cast. However, the most complex character with the best arc in this movie, is the antagonist Kylo Ren. Ren, played by Adam Driver, gives us an extremely intimidating villain with a troubled past we are eager to discover. Ultimately, he serves us more than a Darth Vader wannabe. JJ Abrams alongside Lawrence Kasdan wrote a fun and entertaining screenplay with plenty of emotional plot twists and content. Each main character has its own background and motivation, which develops over the duration of the film. A pleasant surprise to see is the humor used in the movie. The comedic relief in the film was used very effectively in developing chemistry and sympathy for the characters. It is also a sign that the movie does not take itself too seriously as the prequels did. The Force Awakens is filled with exhilarating action and moves with great pace during these scenes. Yet, Abrams knows to slow it down during scenes conveying intense emotion giving the audience time to process all that is thrown at them. These combined make it easy to understand the main characters' motivations, making the emotional investment so much better. As is typical of Star Wars, the movie is full of awe inspiring visual images and astonishing sound editing, creating new sounds for laser beams, light sabers, and alien noises. The cinematography is equally impressive, showing beautiful landscape shots of new planets reminiscent of the original trilogy. The cinematographer also shows us a diverse array of shots, giving heart- pounding POV shots inside the cockpit and nice long shots of the battlefield giving it a great scope while avoiding confusion caused by the numerous explosions. John Williams makes a welcome return to the Star Wars franchise with a bombastic new score, but also with nicely timed inserts of his famous original music to bring up emotional heartwarming feeling among the old-school fans. In conclusion, The Force Awakens is a return to greatness for the Star Wars franchise. This beautiful reunion of old characters combined with the introduction of promising new characters results in an emotional, adventure trip that left me excited for what is coming next. To quote Jimmy Kimmel, this movie was probably ""the most anticipated sequel since the New Testament"". So expect this movie to be under the most intense scrutiny by reviewers as they dissect the movie to its core to find the tiniest (I.E. laughably non-existent) flaws. In the end, The Force Awakens delivers as a fantastic Star Wars film and an incredibly worthy addition to the franchise."
" This IS the sequel you're looking for
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,10,"Words cannot describe the perfection that is this film. JJ Abrams did a fantastic job, better than anything Lucas could. Solid cast, action, effects, everything. I'm still stuck on deciding which is better between this and The Empire Strikes Back, which speaks for itself. Go see this film, even if you're not a Star Wars fan, you will become one. I cannot wait to see the future of Star Wars in Episodes 8, 9 and all the spin off movies. And thankfully, there isn't any Jar Jar Binks or young Anakin Skywalker. Instead we have interesting, diverse and excellently played characters.What a film!"
" Far and way the greatest film of 2015!
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,10,"Star Wars The Force Awakens is a beautiful film. It's the Star Wars film that we've been waiting for for 30 years, the film that the prequels failed to deliver. It is full of gorgeous visuals, memorable characters, and genuinely funny lines but above all, it truly felt like how a Star Wars movie should feel. Wildly entertaining, at no point during the film did I feel removed from the action, or that I was waiting for the next scene to happen. The movie is very fast paced, with very few slow moments. That being said, the action flows together perfectly and somehow manages to never feel rushed. For me, by far the best part of The Force Awakens were the characters. And I don't mean Han, Luke, and Leia. While it was great to see the original three back in action, and Harrison Ford gave another brilliant performance as Han Solo, the ones that really stole the show were the new characters. The story centers around Rey, an independent, resourceful scavenger on the planet Jakku. Rey has clearly endured many hardships throughout her life and yet somehow, she remains hopeful about her future and maintains a strong optimistic attitude. As the movie progresses, we see Rey begin to discover her powers with the force and how to use them. But only towards the end of the film do we realize how powerful she truly is, and I am very excited to see what's in store for her in episodes 8 and 9. Part of what made Rey such a believable, effective character was the spectacular acting performance by Daisy Ridley. No other actor could have done a better job. The majority of the comic relief in this film comes from Finn, an ex storm trooper who encounters Rey in the desert after he crashes while trying to escape the First Order. It was fascinating to see a little inside the life of a storm trooper, something we never really saw in any of the previous films. Finn is equally as believable a character as Rey, and John Boyega's performance was spot on as well. Part of what made these two characters so great was the on screen chemistry between them, something that the prequels failed to deliver with Anakin and Padme.As for Kylo Ren, aka Ben Solo, it was awesome to see such a complex character that has so many layers as the villain. We learn more about Kylo Ren's back story and personality in this one film than we do about Darth Vader in almost all of the original trilogy. The light saber temper tantrums, the side punching, the conversations with Darth Vader's helmet, Kylo Ren is the perfect balance of emotional kid and pure bad-ass. Star Wars The Force Awakens has brought back everything that I loved about the original Star Wars while at the same time, adding an element of mystery that did not exist in the originals. The movie is pure fun to watch and is so entertaining that I didn't notice any of the issues until my second viewing. If a massive grin didn't spread across your face when Han and Chewy burst through the doors of the millennium falcon, or if you didn't get goosebumps when Finn ignited Anakin's light saber for the first time, then you were never a TRUE Star Wars fan to begin with.Facts and even more facts. You're welcome ; )"
" The top movie in the series (in other news, water is wet. LOL)
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie with my wife and I have to say this was even better than I ever thought possible!All these people that want to compare this to episode 4 are just the type of people I am sure that just can't be pleased no matter what you do for them. Wake up spammers with boring lives, This is STAR WARS driven by the best part of the force. I consider this a continuation of brilliance at its finest. You people that endlessly cry about this movie did actually see it, right? LOL Can't wait to see this story continue for years to come. This has made me an even bigger fan of Star Wars. I thought the acting was top notch, especially Harrison Ford, he stepped right back into that role perfectly.Enjoy an amazing movie for exactly what it is.........AMAZING!"
" Best film of the Star Wars saga. By......a.........MILE.
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,10,"I know biased fanboys of the painfully average, outdated original trilogy will cluelessly cry about this, but yes, The Force Awakens is the most well made film of the Star Wars saga. This film has all the goodness of the original movies, characters who are easily likable, incredible effects, John Williams' rousing musical score and a great time at the cinema, enjoyable with our families and friends. But there are things which are even better than the original movies. Interaction between the lead characters is so natural, you got to commend the writers and the director J J Abrams for their amazing work. Most blockbuster films today tend to focus on spectacle and visual effects enhanced action over tender human moments. This film balances action and human drama amazingly well. The new characters are extremely memorable, the new actors Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are wonderful in their roles, along with Oscar Isaac. BB8 is extremely adorable, dare I say even better than R2D2. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is a worthy villain, with the best motion capture actor in the world Andy Serkis, doing what he does best, as Supreme Leader Snoke. The visual effects on display here are incredible, and unlike the prequels which were ruined by their CGish feel, this one relies on practical effects. Almost everything in this film looks real, the stormtroopers look real, because they are real mean in armor, kudos for J J Abrams for not using CGI even for closeup shots of troopers. J J Abrams is a better director than George Lucas, and that will be very clear when you see the film. This film deserves every award and acclaim it received. A film as widely anticipated and hyped as this can rarely ever be this good, and yet........it is!"
" Abrams Wins.......Again!
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,10,"I was lucky enough to see The Force Awakens on its release day and I'm glad to say that it was spectacular! The movie was well directed and a genuine Star Wars feel was evident throughout.Throughout the whole 2 and a half hour running time, I was treated to a masterpiece of visual effects as well as well as a compelling and convincing story which introduced the two new lead characters: Rey and Finn. I thought BB-8 was a humorous, cute character and can't wait to see more of him in the upcoming films. JJ Abrams did an amazing job creating easily the best film of the year.Out of all the Star Wars films, this is definitely the second best in the franchise (just BARELY behind The Empire Strikes Back)"
" Star Wars The Force Awakens succeeds across the board!
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,10,"As I followed the production process of Episode 7, I was looking for evidence that they were holding to ideals hopefully wayyyyyyy better than Lucas' prequel trilogy.Going into the new film, I was mostly concerned with them capturing the look and feel of the original movies. I determined that if they got that right, the story could be appreciated more. Since they got Lawrence Kasdan (writer of the Empire Strikes Back, my favorite movie) on board with writing credits along with JJ Abrams and Michael Arndt (both huge Star Wars fans), I was less concerned with the story they wrote than they means they chose to convey it. I was a little concerned about the reprisal of characters from the original trilogy that are WELL ON in years, but I didn't put much thought into it because I knew the story wasn't going to be about them.I'm happy to say: JJ ABRAMS AND CO DID NOT LET US DOWN.They built real sets and props, by hand, but weren't afraid to lean on the use of digital technology as needed. The result is a movie filled with gritty, organic places that just plain and simple...feel real. The digital effects, are soooooooo good too. Easily the most real-looking lightsaber effects I've ever seen.The newest cast members are FANTASTIC. The older actors really shine through as well, a lot more than I thought, honestly. Especially Harrison Ford, he really manages to still capture the same spirit that makes him Han Solo, despite being considerably older. The new story raises plenty of questions as well, really setting the stage for the following films and what's to come. But, as I've hinted at, I'm thoroughly satisfied with the film on the look and feel alone. Let's also not forget NEW STAR WARS MUSIC. The newest John Williams score is fantastic, and is essential to capturing the magic of what Star Wars feels like. I give it a 10/10, though I can understand some people giving it a high 8 or 9/10."
" A very very mediocre film
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,1,"This film was over hyped to oblivion. Expectations were high and as a result it was just played too safe. Many of the ideas were straight up stolen from other, more successful, Star Wars movies.Plot holes are everywhere and main character is a bland know it all who seems to be better than everyone by default, has no struggles and a very obvious plot armor.The whole movie was just a risk free cash grab and it had no amazing story to tell, it literally recycled the plot of older movies. Now don't get me wrong, the prequels were not good movies, probably not better than this one in execution, however they had their own ideas, their own stories and world building for fans to enjoy. All in all this movie isn't really good, and after the initial hyped died down people started to understand that more and more. The initial IMDb score for this movie was so out of proportion, it was rated like it was a masterpiece, however over the time grade just kept going down and down and will soon be in the 7.xx where it still probably doesn't belong. If you have any doubts about seeing this movie read couple of reviews here that go into more detail. There are tons and tons of good ones that show on the top. Just don't bother reading recent reviews, because there seems to be 1 dude spamming good reviews over and over again on new accounts."
" As Bad (or worse) As you Have Heard
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,1,"As far as Hollywood remakes go this is a bad one. You can almost see the bean counters on screen staring at you laughing with derision.To be fair to Disney and JJ Abrams (the director who is now officially called Jar Jar Abrams) serious or epic films is not their forte. Also, this is episode 7. How may series do you know that were good 7 films in? So, one has to be fair.bad acting, very very amateurish, coincidences galore and all the elements and plots from the original are done in an inferior fashion in this reboot. There are dozens of sources on the Internet going through the plot holes so I will skip those, as you skip wasting your money."
" Hope Lucas Is Enjoying His $4 billion
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,1,I have watched all the Star Wars films. When the greedy ones at Disney Corporation took over I was still hoping to see the last three episodes of this saga. Well thanks Disney Corporate for totally destroying what was once a great saga. I do not care how many more cash-ins you greedy raiders release I am done with Star Wars. This was the single worst episode of the series even if it was a reboot that I have ever watched. Does Disney know where they are going with Star Wars or are they just shovelling manure out in order to recoup the payments to George Lucas. It was not until the middle of this film that I figured out it had no resemblance to the quality of Star Wars. I am an optimistic guy. At least Disney could afford bringing in good actors. What sort of a casting do they do?
" Star Wars: The Force Awakens Review(re-upload)
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,8,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens Is a newest chapter in the long running Space opera saga, taking place 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. We learn from the opening text crawl that in the absence of Luke Skywalker, the sinister First Order has risen into power led by the menacing Kylo Ren(Adam Driver), who is on the hunt for the last Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker. He is introduced into the film in an explosive sequence setting the tone for the remainder of the film. Driver brings a lot of raw emotion to the part of Ren, who's being tormented by his feelings, and lure to the Light and Dark side. During the opening scene Ren comes into contact with newcomer Poe Dameron(Oscar Issac) a rebel fighter pilot regarded as the best in the resistance. Who is handed a vital piece of information, that could lead to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker, and thus sets off a chain of events bringing in old and new characters alike. Issac brings a-lot of likability as Poe to the film, and was reminiscent of Han Solo(Harrison Ford) In the original trilogy. Whilst on the Planet of Jakku we're introduced to Finn(John Boyega) a disillusioned stormtrooper, who wants out of the First Order. Boyega plays the part with a lot enthusiasm, and joy he brings a lot of laughs to the story whilst maintaining his own dramatic moments through out the story. He eventually comes into contact with a scavenger named Rey(Daisy Ridley) on the planet Jakku. Who struggles to make a living finding scraps/relics for food, she is also torn between waiting for her family to come back, and realising that her journey is much more then salvaging parts, when She crosses paths with Finn and a lovable new droid named BB8. After a thrilling escape from the First Order our heroes come across veterans of the original series Han Solo(Ford) and the Wookie Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew). Ford does a good job of tying the mythos of the original trilogy, and connecting us with the newcomers, without ever leaving old viewers feeling cold and new viewers guessing as too what is happening.From the moment the film begins it maintains a breakneck pace, that hardly allows the viewer to stop and reflect what's happening with the plot of the film, which Is a good thing, because there are a-lot of plot holes In the film. We are also given enough information sprinkled throughout the film so that all the new characters feel fleshed out enough, to make us care about them.The film spends most of the first half on a desert planet named Jakku, The cinematography Is beautiful to look at, the screen Is filled with sweeping landscapes that gives the world a vast feeling of isolation and hopelessness. Disney brought In director JJ Abrams, who recently came off of rebooting the successful Star Trek franchise. He's the perfect choice to re-invigorate this franchise, his use of practical effects give this film a weight that all the prequels were sorely missing. We feel the size and scope of Starkiller Base, the heaviness of the Lightsabers, you feel the impact of the blaster rifles. The use of real locations and sets also give the film a-lot of natural colour which bursts onto the screen. Where-as the prequel trilogy which was all shot on digital, and Used a lot of CGI characters and effects. CGI in the film is used to a minimum and only used when needed. There were however a couple of characters, Unkar Plutt and Maz Kanata which felt like they could of been done better. In a couple scenes they look out place when surrounded by practical effects and actors in costumes and make up. Overall the film is visually stunning to look at because of this it gives the film(and series) a fresh vibrancy that has been lacking since Return of the Jedi. There are also just the right amount of callbacks, without it becoming crowd-pleasing, there is a plenty of nostalgia and references to the original films that fans of the series will recognise. John Williams also creates a new score with him that feels a little lacklustre when compared to original and prequel films. The only memorable theme being Kylo Rens.There were on the other hand certain aspects of the film which felt like it was treading old water from A New Hope, especially Starkiller Base, which is essentially a third Deathstar that feels like it's only part of the film so there's a third act, for all our heroes too band together and fight. It's hard not too notice certain similarities from the A New Hope, and at times feels like It's been done to play things safe after the backlash of the Prequels. The film is also filled a lot of humorous moments as-well, which helps to lighten up some of the darker aspects of the film, although not every joke hits the mark, and occasionally they feel out of place, especially during the the last act of the film.Star Wars the: The Force Awakens is filled with excellent set pieces which immerses the audience back into the universe. We're given enough plot information, and character development to draw us into the the new generation of characters. Whilst some areas feel familiar, there Is a lot too love about this film, watching this In the Cinema was an Incredibly exciting and engaging experience, which had me feeling like a kid watching the original films for the first time and being swept away into a galaxy far, far away. This film has resurrected the Star Wars franchise, and made it one of the must see film experiences of the year."
" You know the difference between Lucas and Abrams? One had a super vision, and the other a supervision...
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,5,"There might be some moments of awesomeness but it's of the calculated type, designed by Disney executives who know you can't win two billion dollars with art-house stuff.Of course, the premise helped: the seventh episode of the ""Star Wars"" saga, what's more with all the beloved characters we left thirty years ago: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca and Princess Leia, what's more at the time the Internet reigns supreme, so I guess the first billion was a sure-win, but talk about teasing the audience with that ""Chewie, we're home"". I really expected to feel 'at home' in that film. Sure, I expected they would deconstruct the myth a little but not pulverize it ""Death Star"" style.A myth can either be enriched or extended, but as long as you remain reasonably faithful to its emotional core. And ""Star Wars"" has always been driven by two universal themes: good vs. evil, and the process of learning, it's not about being a Jedi or using the Force, but overcoming your flaws, learning patience, humility, courage and virtues leading, step by step, to the ultimate victory. And all that was wrapped up into a majestic space-opera setting served by special effects and a gallery of characters who became part of a canon that transcended the frontiers of Hollywood. ""Star Wars"" belongs to our modern heritage.And ""The Force Awakens"" cheats with that legacy, sure it has the package, but the sold product left me with a bitter taste. I'm sorry but you don't cheat with ""Star Wars"". Luke Skywalker's evolution, Leia and Han's relationship, not to mention Darth Vader's redemption spanned three movies, six years and a real genocide of Stormtroopers. The prequels, while not in the same league, featured similar arcs and at least its conclusion brought us an extraordinary feeling of completeness. So if you're going to start another trilogy, you better respect the spirit of the predecessors.But spirit or no spirit, I guess the real problem is that there was no call for a sequel after all. At the end of ""Jedi"", the Empire is annihilated and everyone can finally enjoy the peaceful time they've been waiting for two generations. Luke was a full Jedi finally reconciled with his past, Han and Leia were in love and while I didn't like the Ewoks much, the celebration felt conclusive. If you decide that history is a series of new beginnings, that Luke will disappear because one Jedi has betrayed him and killed junior Jedis. That Han (who had some military high ranks) will be a smuggler again and Leia the General of Resistance after a new Galactic Empire has somewhat managed to reemerge from chaos then... what's the point? If it ends well at the ninth movie, what prevents them from adding a new twist? Basically, any Jedi can surrender to the Dark Side, it's a never-ending story and there's a fine line between being a saga and a space soap opera any lousy script can cross at lightspeed. All good things must come to an end, think of the ending of the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, we knew we'd miss Doc and Marty, but that's what re-runs are for.I didn't say much about the film because everything has been said to that point, yes, it is a retread of the 'New Hope' material with the same story structure, J.J. Abrams, a man who knows his job and Kathleen Kennedy the producer, didn't take any risks, they played it safe, by the book: a conflict as the set-up, a secret mission, a young scavenger named Rey who'll discover she has 'special skills', a bad guy turning good, a good guy turning bad, weird-looking helpers or enemies, bombings, space chases, catchy names, and a gallery of interesting newcomers like Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, but all the good intentions of the world don't amount to much when a director lacks a vision.The first trilogy had practical effects and a fresh story, The prequel trilogy had CGI but a fresh story as well, this one has CGI and a recycled story. It's true it has the original actors but just because it hits the sentimental and nostalgic chord more than once, it can't escape from criticism. And my biggest problem with the film is that since it had nothing new to bring up, its most notable feat was to adapt the story to the mentalities of our era. It's literally ""Frozen"" meets ""Star Wars"", that's not a vision, that's a supervision of cringe-worthy politically correct implications.Say what you want about the prequels, but I'd rather have genuine flaws than calculated awesomeness. In ""Awakens"", the plot of ""New Hope"", ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"" are compacted in a way that is insulting to Yoda's legacy and the long initiation of Luke Skywalker. I won't make a thesis about it, let's just say the heroine is perfect, independent and skilled, she's even capable to pilot the Falcon and when Solo holds her a gun, she dares to say ""I can handle myself"", which doesn't make sense at all even from ""girl-power"" standards.The film left me shaking my head constantly, Abrams, Kennedy and Disney are damaging a legacy with so many ""Star Wars"" movies I've lost track, and I guess we'll have to accept that the franchise is ruled by a sort of corporate 'Dark Side' with a business-oriented and PC agenda, so blatant it's scary. And proof that it's PC bull crap, there's one controversial scene Abrams apologized about, the very fact that he apologized proved that the guy is really trying hard to widen the appeal of the film, that he missed that scene revealed his real mindset: he didn't want to hurt. Never apologize, Duke said, it's a sign of weakness.Anyway, five for the ride, zero for the rest. The prequels weren't perfect, but at least, there was a vision."

Can Disneyland make it any less obvious that they are trying to rip us off? It has been years since we watch the original film, but we could tell every plot element coming because they are the exact same... they just switched the man with the good acting with a woman who frankly cannot act. And that is fine, the director cannot direct either. he is too obvious and shallow. We found the droid cute but of course it should be for sale at the Disney Store, right? LOLWe will save our money for the next episode whatever that is."
" Brilliant!!!
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,10,"From the the intro to the very end credits, I had goosebumps all the  way. Ignore the hate, because this was the best Star Wars movie so far,  I can't wait for Episodes 8 and 9.  I smiled all the way and never had so much joy in a cinema before. This  movie gives you the Star Wars feeling we all love from the original  trilogy. I wanted to go to the toilet so bad, but I got so in into  movie I never went. The film is simply brilliant. It is not in anyway a  remake of Episode 4, they should try actually re-watching A New Hope.    I recommend this movie to everyone!"
" Sci-Fi geeks are insane! LOL
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,10,"I mean honestly, what do these whiny nerds want? Prior to episode 7, I distinctly remember die-hard fans complaining how the prequels were pure garbage. Now you're all saying you miss the prequels? XD XD XDThis movie was great! I'm seriously baffled by some of these reviews. I'm sure if this series is ever rebooted, or another entry releases in 20+ years, you'll all yearn for JJ's Star Wars. You people have no idea what you want and will just complain no matter what is put forth. Cut the crap.I thought this movie was great. The new characters, Finn and Rey, were instantly likable, and the inclusion of old favorites felt natural. I highly recommend this film and I think most NORMAL people will enjoy it."
" Awesome Movie
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,10,"I saw Star Wars in 1977 and since then I have seen all the episodes multiple times. The Force Awakens is one of the best entries in the series if not the best one yet. I do not understand any negative reviews, especially by the so-called original fans. This movie is awesome and outstanding. Kylo Ren is the best Star Wars villain yet. The young actors are by far better than Hamill, Ford and Fisher were in 1977. Especially Daisy Ridley, who does a very good and convincing job. By the way, the movie is meant to entertain and that is what it does to PERFECTION. 10/10 with ease!"
" Exactly as I expected.
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,10,"I have grown up with Star Wars. I was nine when I went to the original. Empire Strikes Back is my favourite film of all time and I don't care what the basement detractors say, I liked the prequels and they get an undeserved bad rap. They're movies, they're entertaining, get over it. The Force Awakens has everything you want in a Star Wars movie. The acting was good, as was the action and special effects. If you're a fan you owe it to yourself to go see it. If you're a hater you probably still will and then spend the rest of your time on the net complaining how George Lucas raped your childhood and JJ is a hack. Don't listen to the pathetic haters, go see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed!10/10"
" Abrams saves a franchise with only 2 good other films (Rogue One and Empire) to deliver what's EASILY the best one yet!
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,10,"Words cannot describe the perfection that is this film. JJ Abrams did a fantastic job, better than anything Lucas could do/ever has done. Solid cast, action, effects, everything. Go see this film, even if you're not a Star Wars fan, because you will become one. I'll definitely be seeing this multiple times, and I cannot wait to see the future of Star Wars in Episodes 8, 9 and the spin off movies. And thankfully, there isn't any Jar Jar Binks or young Anakin Skywalker. Instead we have interesting, diverse and excellently played characters. What a film.5/5 stars, 10/10, Best movie of 2015, Best Star Wars movie....by far : )"
" Now THIS is Star Wars!
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie is amazing, entertaining, and well crafted as a film in general. The movie is incredibly exciting with humor, action, references and the beautifully written plot. There's so much more I could say about this film but I feel like you should watch it for yourself and enjoy it as much as I did. Ignore anyone who gives this a 1/10, there's not liking a film and then there's bitterness. 10/10 summed up the feeling I had before, during and after watching. It's an absolute masterpiece in every area across the board. End of story."
" Top Two In Star Wars Movies
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,10,"I have no idea why there is so much hate on this movie. This is one of my favorite movies ever! This passed the original by a complete landslide. There are three very critical reasons why it is better than the original.1) Better effects - Obviously the effects are going to surpass the original because of the time difference.2) Better plot - This one brings a whole new level of greatness.3) The New Jedi - Not going to say who it is, but I love this person a lot.All in all, I would definitely recommend going to watch this movie. A+"
" Absolutely perfect in everything it sets out to do.
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,10,"I love Star Wars, especially the original stuff, of course. The Force Awakens stays true to the original trilogy; with the start of the film on a Tatooine-like planet, Jakku, as per usual. It follows the thrilling journey of the brilliant Poe of the Resistance and Finn of past Storm trooper relation, at first, as you are thrown into the blistering excitement. But then there is a twist in the main hero being a girl. It works both simply for a change, but also in that it is pretty much a first in as big a film as Star Wars that the main character is a female. That wouldn't matter, though, if the character wasn't a likable hero, or if the acting wasn't any good. Fortunately, those boxes are ticked, as with every character in the film bar Snoke, who is an example of bad CGI, unfortunately. He doesn't play a very big part, though, and other than him the special effects are fantastic — with the use of more practical effects being a refreshing move from Lucasarts, and one that the film benefits from, as it doesn't look artificial like so many films do nowadays (The Hobbit, Star Wars prequels, Avengers, etc).Along with the great use of practical effects, there are fantastically designed costumes all over the joint, with great designs ranging from the new-look storm troopers to Kylo Ren and his super cool outfit.Going back to character, though, the move from Disney to advertise Finn as the main Jedi was clever, as it meant for the reveal of Rey as the Jedi to be much better than otherwise could have been possible. Finn, though, is a fantastic character, with John Boyega deserving more nominations than he's received for his charismatic performance. One other thing done well with The Force Awakens is the lack of slow story development which so marred the progress of the prequel films, and A New Hope, and also the decision to focus on characters to develop the story other than excess plot development means for better character development and means you actually like the characters, unlike Episodes I, II and III. Moreover, the return of light-heartedness and inclusion of comedy makes it an even more enjoyable watch; however, mixed with darker themes clearly inspired by the best parts of Episode III, there is more violence and concentration on action — with that providing excitement, and the comedy bringing extra enjoyment. Finn personifies the more light- hearted approach along with the brilliant BB8, and Kylo Ren is a fantastic vehicle for the darker side of the film, who I love – even though some people might think he's a bit of a snotty nosed dork. Kylo Ren is probably just as good a villain as Darth Maul in my opinion at least, but he's used much, much better, fortunately. Ah, yes. The Phantom Menace. Let's all remind ourselves of that excellent part of film history. Good for you and me, though, we can forget about that now, because we have the sequel trilogy, which could even be better than the original if they keep on getting things right like they did with this film.One more thing I'm grateful was done right was the score. A mixture of both classic tracks and new ones, it's fantastic in both providing towards all the drama and the overall feel of the film. Because, by using both old tracks and new ones it reminds you of the past (sparking your nostalgia) whilst also bringing something new, which the film does fantastically with every aspect; from the story to the cast to the sets to the action and to the (you guessed it) score. Other than being a tad ridiculous in some plot turns, and lacking quite the same grandness of scale in sets and cast that the original films did – but only just, mind you; it's pretty much perfect in what it has set out to do; providing excitement, enjoyment, drama, action and nostalgia in abundance. Enough for a boy like me to squeal.Verdict:The Force Awakens is the main product of Disney's buy out, and so I'm very happy Disney got involved if it meant this beast of a film was made. It was almost a dream of mine that there would be a sequel trilogy, and it has actually happened, so I was aptly excited. My excitement was repaid emphatically, as when I sat in the cinema fulfilling one of my most anticipated pipe dreams, I was blown away by this surprisingly light-hearted yet violent, action packed and particularly well crafted, yes, beast of a film.So I give it: 94/100."
" There are issues
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,5,"First of all, yes I acknowledge that a 6 is probably too low a score for this movie. It is well above average and deserves around 7, however in my opinion it does not come close to a score of over 8 and therefore I did this to show my displeasure at that high a score.To begin with I think that all the visual effects are stunning, same goes for sound design (as expected from a movie with this large a budget).The action scenes are also well choreographed, edited and shot. And for me these are the high points of the entire picture.Where it lacks however is in the story and to an extent, the characters. The story is a very generic one which follows almost to the letter the first of the franchise. It is, in my opinion, uninspired, dull and playing it far too safe (which is understandable due to the reception of the previous revival of the Star Wars films.)Like I said the characters are also not the best. My favorites of the new ones are probably Poe Dameron and Finn. This is because they get the most screen-time containing actual character development and real CONFLICT.(They were also funny.)The main character of Rey however, has none of these. She is sometimes dead-pan in delivery (= not funny) and faces no REAL conflict. Whenever you think she is going to be at risk and that you will therefore receive some sort of dramatic tension she resolves the issue without much effort, often using the force and it's techniques, which according to the rules of the universe, should take years to master. All of this combined, results in her appearing more like a poorly written 'Mary- Sue' fan-fiction character than the main hero of a movie in one of the most adored franchises in the world. I hope the issues regarding Rey's perfection gets resolved in future installments so that I can hop onto the Rey hype-train and not get disappointed further."
" How many reboots do you know that have entire video libraries mocking it?
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,1,"In the realm of the worst remakes and films in history this one must be the most mocked. I am not only referring to 3,000+ negative reviews on IMDb or the fact that Disney has hired payola reviewers to give this reboot a positive spin, but the hordes of videos on YouTube and vimeo mocking this.Why?Well, the force is in a girl with no training and there is a death star with the same design fault as the one in the original flicks. Unbelievable. There are literally dozens of issues like this in this cash grab, but you can review the reviews on IMDb for that.Fail."
" I Wish I Had Listened To My Friends
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,1,"Being a long time fan of Star Wars I decided to watch this film with my wife and boy I wish I had listened to my friends who all had said this reboot is a markedly inferior remake and makes little sense. They were correct.The bad acting and copycat script are bad enough, but when this boring film starts to make as much sense as the drooling of a madman you know you have wasted your money.We were specially disturbed that the bad guys again control the galaxy. Were they not defeated last time? Apparently some guy called JJ Abrams has taken over and he does not like Star Wars so cares zero for continuity.Avoid"
" Easily the best Star Wars film.....by far.
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,10,"This new edition to the Star Wars franchise is arguably the best by  far. It combines the time-tested formula with the new and raw ideas  Disney brings to the table. From the moment the traditional text crawl  appears, this movie will keep you at the edge of your seat serving you  with action-packed scenes and unpredictable reveals that will surely  make you wanting for more.  One thing I particularly adored is how this new movie creativity uses  the Force. Disney has steered away from the boring 'push and pull'  concept and found ways you could never imagine the Force can be applied  and used on.  The presence of the old cast was monumental as it helped the old  audience transition to the new heroes  as they have similar (but also  diverse) qualities with their old counterparts. The ending, as  expected, is a major cliff-hanger. Expect to walk out of the cinema  dazed, amazed and confused as the movie, not only, answer the old  questions, but at the same time unfold new mysteries for the audience  to ponder on. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a movie this generation  should really see. I genuinely recommend you see it on IMAX so you may  experience the Force in a way that will leave you lost in thought in  the days to come.  You-are-wel-come"
" Blew my mind!
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"I'm a veeeeery long-term Star Wars fan, since back in '77.The Force Awakens was absolutely brilliant - everyone in the IMAX cinema clapped and cheered at the end. And it was a mixed audience too, not just Star Wars nerds like myself.I would describe this movie as a Star Wars that's real and gritty - I felt immersed in every scene, and not once was the spell broken, unlike the tragic prequels.The acting was superb, cinematography was amazing, and I could never tell when CGI was being used! Story was excellent with some unexpected twists, music great as always, action sequences were breathtaking. Everyone in the cinema was quite emotional by the end. I don't know how some people are giving this a low rating, they must be paid trolls getting that big payola payday from someone. LOL just kidding, that's literally the single dumbest thing i've ever heard. XDLooking forward to watching this again and again!Thanks J.J. for coming through ; )"
" The movie was great. Stop the whining.
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"I don't really understand the negative reviews on here. People moaned that the prequels were nothing like the original trilogy and now they are moaning that this is too similar??? LOL Get a life, children!This was an absolutely wonderful movie. Ever since I was 4 years old I've attended star wars openings. And the force awakens was no different. Was it like the old movies? No, of course not. But it was a new take on an ever expanding universe. Everyone on here throwing up 1 or 2 stars are just butthurt. They complain about Disney or JJ Abrams directing it. But the truth is they did a fantastic job revitalizing an old series. It's our jobs as fans to make it the best series possible, so please for the love of god ignore all of these idiots and see the movie. You will not be disappointed!"
" So hilarious to see 1 star troll ratings
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"Just saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Having seen all the movies at least one time each, The Force Awakens was exactly what I wanted it to be. A nod at the aging characters of the original trilogy and the setup for the next two movies. I typically do not write reviews, I just have to say I get such a kick out of the people that give this movie a low rating and share their vitriol filled breakdown of the film. I suppose it is why I only tune in for the first two weeks of American Idol, it's funny to watch a bunch of people lacking talent shaking their fists at why their vision of truth is not accepted by the masses.The damage you funny reviewers have done must be very disappointing to JJ Abrams and Co. And last I checked the overall IMDb rating is an oh-so low 8.1. (AKA ridiculously high by IMDb rating standards) Again, simply hilarious!"
" Superb Entertainment
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"Star Wars Episode 7: The Force Awakens was absolutely incredible. The theater experience was the best movie watching experience I have ever endured. It's worth the hype and so much better than the prequels. In fact, it's my favorite Star Wars film. The cast and characters, old and new, are all phenomenal but Daisy Ridley (Rey) stole the show for me. I have fallen in love with Star Wars all over again. Thank you JJ Abrams for a story that will live on for generations to come. Wow! Bring on Episode VIII! The greatest Star Wars movie of all time and the most fun I've ever had in the theater. I just bought it on blu-ray and will enjoy this film for the remainder of my life. Just amazing."
" The Franchise is rescued!
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"Episode 7 has redeemed a franchise that, for many traditional fans, had become a niggling source of disappointment.This is everything that 1, 2 & 3 weren't. The acting is solid - something we've never really associated with the franchise. The music is not clichéd - there are some new themes which will most likely catch on. The storyline is coherent and promises longevity and the action is gripping. From the opening scene you realise that 32 years after Return of the Jedi and the utter disappointment of 1, 2 & 3, Star Wars fans are finally in for a incredible treat!It is a return to what worked. The directing is solid as is the dialogue. In fact, it's the best dialogue in all eight films. 5*"
" Very disappointing
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,1,"Reading the pages of reviews here I almost did not write this review. Those reviews are right. There is a strong case of deja vu running through this reboot. In other words, if you have seen A New Hope why watch this? The desert planet, the orphan, the death star, the 'alien' bar and so forth.However, it is important to notice that this reboot fails for worse acting, no character development and illogic. How could the new bad guys have soldiers that are clones but do not look like their original?? How could the said soldier pick up a light saber and use it strongly first time ever? Ah, just a kiddie film that makes no sense."
" Grow up and enjoy something for once.
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,10,"Why are all the reviews for this movie so negative??? Whenever I click on user reviews for a good movie like this one, why are the only reviews that come up 1s and 2s? Why does IMDb decide to put all the negative reviews at the front of a movie with a rating in the high 8's when a terrible movie like Pixels has all 9s and 10s??? I find it extremely odd.Star Wars: The Force Awakens was my most anticipated movie of the year, and a lot of people obviously thought the same. And it definitely delivered as an excellent Star Wars film. It met and exceeded all expectations. J.J. Abrams is the director now and he brought back the cool of the original trilogy in a fresh new way. The new cast includes Daisy Ridley as Rey, John Boyega as Finn, and Oscar Isaac as Poe, and all 3 do a fantastic job. Han Solo, Leia, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca return in stunning fashion. Now to the villain: Kylo Ren. He is amazing. His look may not be as cool as Darth Vader, but he definitely is as menacing. Adam Driver did an excellent job as Kylo Ren. Overall, Episode 7 is amazing. It is the perfect sequel to the original trilogy and Return of the Jedi. Everyone in the theater, myself included, watched in awe as the Star Wars franchise picked itself out of the whole it dug itself into with the Prequel Trilogy. The Force Awakens is my new favorite Star Wars, but I still do think Empire Strikes Back is the best one. I can't wait for Episode 8 to come in a couple of years. From A+ to F, Star Wars: The Force Awakens gets an A."
" Absolutely PERFECT.
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,10,"Let me just say that this film was sensational!To begin, the storyline is original and captivating. The acting from the newbies (Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac) is excellent. The acting from the old heroes was also incredible - Harrison Ford is back as Han Solo and Carrie Fisher is back as General Leia Organa, and they are better than ever! The villains are great too (Adam Driver as Kylo Ren) is great! The visuals - especially in IMAX 3D -- quite frankly blew my mind. Nothing looked overly fake like in the prequel trilogy - you really felt like you were part of the movie. The combination of practical and visual effects was brilliant! Another thing about this film, which you typically don't have in Star Wars films (especially the prequels) is humour - and The Force Awakens has plenty and it hits HARD!! And of course, the movie has many emotional moments, yes - I cried at some parts, and the pure nostalgia of it worked beautifully made it so much better! The final shot of the film was not just the best final shot of a Star Wars film - but one of (if not THE) best final shots of any film in cinematic history.Overall, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is more than I expected: it has the perfect blend of action, adventure, humour, some hints of romance, and emotion. By far the best film of 2015, the best Star Wars film, and one of the best movies of all time. Thank you JJ, we trusted you, and you delivered! Cannot wait for Episode 8!"
" Abrams Delivers!
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,10,"First off, PLEASE DO NOT PAY ATTENTION to the negative comments, poor excuses for reviews, and crybaby frustration out there from people who claim to be Star Wars fans. If anybody is upset about this film, does not like the film, or has negative things to say about the film, they are not truly a Star Wars fan and are probably upset that Jar Jar Binks was not in the movie. OK, now I can share my thoughts. Hands-down the greatest Star Wars movie I have ever seen. I say that based on the kid who at four years old saw Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi where I was absolutely floored. Abrams has brought me back to my childhood, has brought Star Wars and the galaxy back to the vintage rusty futuristic garbage scenes & of course the original cast. What I love so much about this movie is that Abrams opens up so many cans of worms that you could literally take this movie in so many different directions it is so exciting and at the same time it is really toiling with my inner spirit. Is Rey Luke Skywalker's daughter? Is Poe wedge Antilles kid? Is Finn Lando's kid? We already know that Kylo Ren is Hans Solo's son. Is Snoke Darth Plageuis? Did Han Solo kill himself or did Kylo Ren kill his father? So many more questions can be addressed, that we will ask those later. I love Rey. She is bold, strong, confident, and a warrior at heart. I love the cast, love the storyline from beginning to end, the best overall Star Wars movie by an absolute mile! 10 out of 10 / cannot wait for The Last Jedi!"
" Fantastic, lost for words!
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,10,"Well, what can I say. First, let me state I'm 42 years old and a massive Star Wars fan. And if there's one reason why this movie is so fantastic, it's that I saw the same wonder and magic in my daughter's eyes that I had when I was a young boy.They did it! They finally managed to bring the Star Wars universe to life. All the bad things from the prequels are gone, all the good parts from the originals are back. It's exciting, funny, spectacular, emotional and everything a Star Wars movie should be. What an achievement from the entire team of director, producers, cast and designers. So many things to love about this. I had been waiting for this for SO long, and god I'm so happy it lived up to my hopes for it.Can't wait to see what's coming!"
" J.J. Abrams Has Restored Hope to the Star Wars Universe
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,10,"I purposely waited 24 hours before writing my review because I wanted to digest the film that long to truly take it in and reflect before I actually reviewed it. I wanted the euphoria of seeing the next chapter of the saga on the big screen to subside some so that I can make an objective review, but alas the euphoria has not subsided and the childlike excitement is still at an 11! This is plain and simply a great Star Wars film! In fact, I feel it is the second best offering of the franchise (behind 'The Empire Strikes Back'). From the opening crawl to the epic and somewhat moving final scene the movie kept you on the edge of your seat. Even now, 24 hours later, I'm still left in awe of what Abrams has done. He has ignited a passion in me that has lied dormant for a decade thanks to the dreadful prequel trilogy. After Episode III I vowed never to see another George Lucas Star Wars film ever again. The prequels were cheesy (and not in a good way) and lacked imagination. They borrowed heavily from the expanded universe (which flies in the face of his original assertion that he had planned out the prequels before Episode IV was even made) and spat in the face of Star Wars fans everywhere. Lucas is now (thankfully) out of the picture and in steps admitted Star Wars fan J.J. Abrams who is quickly establishing himself as this generations Steven Spielberg. Abrams intention was to reignite the franchise and call upon his own boyhood wonderment when seeing the original trilogy for the first time and try to recreate that with the sequel by meshing old and new to weave a new chapter in the saga. What Abrams has done so well here is he's managed to keep the older cast members relevant while also creating new characters who feel like they've always been part of the story. He's been able to expertly bridge the generation gap and bond the older cast members with the new ones to create a cohesive story that is not only enjoyable to watch, but really FEELS like a Star Wars film from the epic battle scenes, music, costumes, sets - every part of the film, even down to the bits and pieces that Rey scavenges oozes STAR WARS and it is fantastic. I won't delve into the plot for fear of spoiling it, but the film obviously revolves around a core of new characters in the Star Wars Universe - Rey, a young scavenger who lives on the desert planet of Jakku, Finn a former Stormtrooper who is desperate to escape the clutches of The First Order, Poe Dameron the top fighter pilot of the Resistance and his trusty droid BB-8, and Kylo Ren, a member of the First Order and a wannabe Sith who acts as the main antagonist of the film. There are other supporting cast including General Hux, a First Order General, Captain Phasma, the leader of the Stormtroopers, Maz Kanata, a pirate and collector of artifacts, and Supreme Leader Snoke who is the leader of the First Order. Several former characters are weaved into the film with Han Solo and Chewbacca seeing the majority of the screen time from that group. The connection between old and new is a constant theme in the film and it is pulled off masterfully. The film is an emotional roller-coaster from beginning to end and is a movie that I will always cherish thanks to it's re- ignition of my love for the franchise. There isn't much more that I can say other than if you are even remotely a fan of the Star Wars Universe you owe it to yourself to see this. Even if you are not, there is a lot to keep you entertained here and you never know, it may turn you into a fan of the franchise if you're not careful, regardless quit reading this and go see it!"
" Best Movie Ever?
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,10,"I don't understand why this movie has gotten so many negative reviews. I think it is underrated, so I was compelled to give it a perfect 10 score. My original thinking was that it was somewhere around 9.5.There are some flaws. I had trouble dealing with how quick Rey seemed to develop Force abilities, and then defeat a skilled and seemingly powerful enemy who could freeze laser bolts, something never seen before. Ren was severely injured, so this didn't bother me to a great degree. Just a little nag. Another less nagging flaw was how the Solo just happened to be in the area when the Falcon escapes the planet. The Galaxy is pretty big for him to just happen to be there. But there's a number of explanations for that--maybe he frequented those routes, explaining why his stolen ship would be near where he did business. Maybe he knew who had his ship, and knows who Rey is. We sure don't. In their negative reviews, people are jumping to conclusions about minor things that could be explained in the next movie. They aren't even plot holes because they are just a bit anomalous at this point. They just don't like it. There's a lot of talk about it being unoriginal, stealing ideas from the original movies--a third Death Star even. I don't see this either. The plot seems to be 'stealing' ideas from the now debunked Expanded Universe. The next superweapon after the Death Star was a ship that could destroy stars. So if they have a giant ship that goes into a star system and shoots the sun, not the target planet, and all the good guys have to send ships to destroy it before it shoots, they'd everyone would still complain it was another Death Star. Starkiller Base was much different than the Death Star or its probable inspiration from the extended universe. The movie was great. There are few flaws. I haven't been to a theater in years, and this movie made me decide to go. Well worth it. Empire Strikes Back may be the only Star Wars film better, assuming all things were equal. But with 35 years advancement in special effects, this movie is probably way more fun."
" Simply Amazing
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,10,"I vaguely remember my first introduction to Star Wars. My uncle had taken me with his family to see some horror flick at the Drive-in about a ship that needed to kill people in order to keep the engine running; I seem to remember grey uniforms and it might have a gun ship of some kind? I don't remember too well; I was young, it was gross, and so I didn't pay attention. Looking out the back window of the station wagon, I saw the opening scenes of Empire Strikes Back. I spent the rest of the time entranced, even without having any sound. My first ""grown up"" movie in a normal theater was Return of the Jedi. My mom had the Beta disks. I wore them out. I had the tape series. I wore it out. twice. Then, the movies were re-released. And altered. And the death spiral of the series began.Most everyone complains about how annoying the prequels were. I was more wondering how they ever got made with so much blatant bigoted stereotyping. I have a thick skin for that sort of stuff, and I was starting to get offended. On top of very thoroughly documented complaints already raised against those rejects.But this.... This brought back all the wonder, all the excitement of that little 5 year old looking through the back window, so many years ago. This IS the sequel we have been waiting 30 years for. And it was worth the wait.Old school effects mixed with CGI, the classic musical score, a director that knew where to go and why, actors new enough to push their roles, while still experienced enough to successfully play them. Just enough questions answered to leave you fulfilled, while several obviously still await answers.This is all we hoped for."
" Worst job they could have done with a great series.
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,5,"The plot is cringingly predictable. It's the exact same as Episode 4 A New Hope. The new villain is also laughably childish with no depth of character. He's not even scary as he takes off his mask at his hostage's request. The action is nothing we haven't seen before in other Star Wars movies. If anything, the fight choreography is less impressive than other the other Star Wars films. No elements of good storymaking. By the time Han Solo dies I was thinking damn what a waste, killing such a character we've invested so much emotion into over the years and yet his death wasn't sad at all.I give this a 5, only because with how much money they poured into this, the action sequences and special effects themselves make this movie at least mildly entertaining."
" The Worst
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,1,Indeed as everyone knows this film is bad and bad and worse. That is  not new. For more information read the 16 pages of straight negative  reviews on this site. They add quite a bit to our thinking about this  reboot. What I wanted to add is that even if i am a woman i still think  character development is necessary and a female lead should be  justified. This is Star Wars! think about those things! What is more is  that despite the copious number of very bad reviews of this reboot I  have read positive reviews of this film that insult Star Wars and its  fans. Clearly those people speak a truth. people who like this reboot  hate Star Wars (in addition being Disney office employees as evidenced  by the fact that they refer to 'franchise' because they are corporate  jerks). Ignore those Star Wars haters and Disney employees and  boycott Episodes 7 to 15. They are craptacular reboot rip offs.
" Freaking amazing
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,10,"I simply can not comprehend how anyone would give this a bad review! It was, without a doubt, brilliant. The directing was amazing, to the point where you're so immersed in the scenes, I actually felt giddy during some of the flight scenes. The special effects are tastefully done, and are a perfect follow on from its predecessors. Nostalgia rules in this thrilling film, we felt like applauding several times throughout, and got goosebumps in some amazing scenes. It was also surprisingly humorous, (in appropriate amounts), and the balance of new characters vs returning characters and story lines was brilliant. 10 out of 10 for me. Go see it, you won't regret it."
" Lived up to the hype
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,10,"This is the first movie i have ever gone to see back to back and I must say it lived up to the hype.Like most people when i first saw that Disney where going to be making new star wars movies I was a little disappointed because i thought that they would be more like the prequels than the originals. But JJ did a fantastic job of making the film fresh and at the same time you knew it was a star wars film.I loved Rey and think that she is better than Anakin in the prequels, and I might even say she is on par if not better than Luke. i hope that the 2 other main movies and the spin off movies are just as good if not better than episode 7."
" Disney and Abrams bring Star Wars back to full glory.
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,10,"I know I'm late to the Star Wars party, but there's an old say; better late than never. By now, many of us had seen what Abrams and Disney brought to us to the big screen, as it's currently breaking box office records left and right, and could possibly Avatar for highest grossing domestic film of all time in a matter of days now. It's been 10 years since the last Star Wars film, and boy, it couldn't had come out in a better time. Abrams and Disney bring us Episode 7: The Force Awakens. How good is it?The film takes place 30 years after the events of Return of Jedi. Darth Vader is defeated, and the galaxy is at peace. Until a new threat named Kylo Ren tries to take over the galaxy. He's after a map that could tell us where Luke Skywalker is. Luke has disappeared over the last 30 years and both the First Order and the Resistance and searching for him. The plot is very basic, but definitely does scream Star Wars. Abrams and his other writers did a good job with the plot for the 7th installment in the Star Wars saga, as it continues where we left off, and leaves us wanting more in the end. The plot introduces us to new heroes such as Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), and Rey (Daisy Ridley).Now Abrams brought back some of the old characters we loved in the original Star Wars trilogy. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher returns as Leia, and even Chewbacca returns. Now they're introduced later on in the film, but Han and Chewie gets the most screen time. Now the new characters really carry this film. Poe is a Resistance pilot, Finn is a former Stormtrooper trying to change his ways, and Rey is a scavenger from the planet Jakku, who trades pieces of ships for reward. Of course, there's the little orange and white droid known as the BB-8 who plays as the trusty droid. The film focuses more on Rey and Finn the most as they team up with Han and Chewie in the second act of the film. They all serve the plot well, and the young good actors do a good job at portraying the heroes. Replacing Darth Vader is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who joined the Dark Side in a similar fashion as Darth Vader did. Adam Driver does a good job as playing the villainous Kylo Ren as he opposes as a threat to our new heroes in future movies.It's good to see Star Wars back on top. JJ Abrams brings the Star Wars saga back to life. We had to sit through George Lucas' prequel trilogy, but now we have a new trilogy we can enjoy and sit through. The hype was worth the wait, the old characters we all love are back, and the new characters are going to be loved by fans of this franchise. The story is good, and the visual effects are fantastic. It has everything we love about Star Wars, from the opening crawl to the classic John Williams score. I did have some nitpicks here and there. I did felt the second act did drove on for awhile, but that's mild criticism at best. Like Disney did with Marvel, Lucasfilms is in good hands as well, and I'll be looking forward to future Star Wars movies made by Disney. If you haven't check it out already, go check it out immediately. This is one expert if you don't want to miss on the big screen. This gets an easy 10/10 from me."
" Saving Star Wars from George Lucas
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,10,"J.J. Abrams managed to deliver what fans have craved for the last three decades: a Star Wars film that is actually good. The film manages to capture the spirit of the original trilogy, and presents it with skilled acting, plausible dialogue, and ass-kicking, multi-layered characters (for the first time ever). I'm eager to see how the Star Wars universe develops now that it's finally in capable hands: Abrams and his associates understand Lucas's creation better than Lucas ever did."
" Perfect! Hands down the best one yet! Insecure trolls are out in full force.
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,10,"Let me start by saying I didn't know what to expect before going to see this movie. Last night we were standing in line and you could feel the anxiety of everyone looking forward to this film.THIS IS THE BEST STAR WARS YET!Let me tell you why...All the actors can act - Everyone from Daisy Ridley to Adam Driver gave stunning performances. It's the first Star Wars movie I have ever seen where the acting was worthy all around.Great Directing - The only movie that can rival this one as far as directing goes was Empire. They are both on the same level. Needless to say this movie is leaps and bounds beyond the prequels. Great job JJ!It's Funny - Remember watching Jar Jar Binks and wanting to punch a hole in something? There is none of that nonsense in this movie. There are lot's of laughs and it has the same comedic value of the originals.Great Action! Action, and more Action!There are a few twists and a few tears to be shed. I honestly felt emotion while watching this movie. And that hasn't happened since the Empire Strikes Back. Everyone leaving the theater also loved the movie... You can usually tell an audience reaction to a movie by their interaction... and they were loud!"
" Ignore the vocal minority of jaded, clueless (friendless) nerds
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,10,"As a 30 something who grew up on the original trilogy and like so many others was utterly disappointed by the prequels I went into viewing The Force Awakens with great anxiety and reservation. This movie delivered in so many ways. I am not going to write a detailed or even general review of the film as I truly feel one should go into viewing knowing as little as possible. This is one time I think the critics are on track, as evidenced by the overwhelmingly positive reviews and Fresh rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. It's actually higher than any previous Star Wars movie--including the much praised Empire. My advice is this: Try to sit in the theater and enjoy this movie. If you try to dislike it... you might just succeed. But I can honestly say this is the most fun I've had watching ANY movie in a long time. P.S. Don't watch this with a negative nancy type imbecile, watch it with someone who enjoys fun, exciting and well made movies!"
" Not Star Wars, not even close...
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,4,"There are some fairly cool action sequences, but overall the movie pays no honor to the originals. A good percentage of the film is comprised of boring scene after boring scene, with horrendously poor acting.And having Harrison Ford in this actually detracted from the overall feel. We all have to admit that he's getting old, and he simply cannot live up to the Han Solo mystique...**Update** I'm changing my assessment of Harrison and Chewie a bit, they did make for a few minutes of fun ala' the original...but, I'm afraid he needs to step away from Star Wars for good...Carrie Fisher, nooooo...her contribution seemed to be standing around waiting for someone to feed her some lines, nothing more...I looked and looked, but I couldn't find an actor amongst the bunch of new faces who were credited as front line actors, and the plot was so convoluted as to be non existent.I was being charitable by giving it a 4, frankly..."
" A perfect Star Wars, A cinematic masterpiece.
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,10,"I have been watching Star Wars since I could walk, knowing the inside and out of every nook and cranny in the series. I, like many of you, adore the original 1977 release far more than the 1997, and despise Jar Jar Binks. Honestly, the Phantom Menace should have never existed.The series took a massive slide during Episodes I, II and III. No one can deny this. It had some great things, but overall it was a flop. The CGI was a total crash-and-burn. But Episode VII, my god did it return the series to greatness!It contained everything you wanted. The death of a master, a man carving his destiny of hate to the dark side, a hero who rises above, a traitor, love, anger, and best of all, the familiar faces we all wanted back. The crawling title is by far the most amazing opener to a film I have ever seen. I lost track of everything else in the world for a moment. Time stood still, reading a stellar setup for a masterpiece. It had everything you could want. I was nearly brought to tears.It is no secret that our villain cannot live up to Darth Vader, arguably the greatest villain of all time. Or can he? He may turn out to become even more great than Vader, fueled by hate and fear of not being as powerful as the man that stood king before him. This pushes Kylo Ren to be more ferocious than Vader could ever have been. He has to be the best and no one will stop him.As for our hero and her companion, they are phenomenal. Finn is true. A traitor to the dark side, stolen from his family, he grows up and makes his own choice to sacrifice himself for the greater good of the galaxy. But Finn is paled in comparison to Rey. I do not even know where to begin. Rey is perfect. She is what the galaxy needed. A rag-tag hero who lets go of everything she ever knew and goes to fight for the resistance. She is truly fearless and strong minded like Luke. She will be the perfect hero for a perfect trilogy.With Kylo Ren being parallel to Anakin Skywalker and Rey to Luke, this series has so much more in store for us. It was perfect beyond belief. Touches of the old were spliced with the new and together they form a bond that will stand the test of time."
" JJ Abrams made Star Wars cool again!
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,10,"JJ made something that the previous trilogy completely missed; strong characters! Star Wars is back on track as we return to essentials: lovable, heartwarming and inspiring characters. Rey and Finn are the future of the saga! BB-8 had the same effect that R2D2 had in the original trilogy and fit in perfectly.All in all, Star Wars is back to its best! Pure 10/10"
" Don't let the trolls deceive you: this movie is bliss
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,10,"Isn't a little suspicious that a movie that has 95% approval by critics and 93% approval by fans at RottenTomatoes, an 81 score at Metacritic and a 8.1 overall score at IMDb has so much 1/10 stars reviews at the IMDb user reviews section? This section has been invaded by trolls. No doubt about it.I've watched this movie 3 times already and people always leave the theater with huge smiles on their faces. The Force Awakens is all about enjoying the ride — and what a ride! JJ Abrams achieved an impossible mission: he honored the past by setting the groundwork for the future without pissing off hardcore Star Wars fans.The pace of the movie and the witty dialogue makes the story fly. Much better than Return of the Jedi and especially the original, painfully outdated A New Hope. The Force Awakens is everything that fans and non-fans have been waiting for!"
" It beats Empire!!!
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,10,"Being a long time fan of the original, prequel, and the EU I came into this movie expecting at movie that was sub par at best compared to the original trilogy but no. This film was far better than I could have anticipated! The almost spine chilling performance of Adam Driver (Kylo Ren) Daisy Ridley (Rey) and John Boyega (Finn) is superb and can keep up with the original stars like Harrison ford (Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (General Leia/ Princess Leia). The plot might have been a little sloppy at some moments when plot devices required it but the tension you feel in the movie is so moving. My feelings after the film have caused me to feel a mix of despair and love. Anyone who doesn't cry at least 3 times while watching this movie has no soul at all, that I can guarantee. This movie rocked me so hard that I had to sit at my local theater for 20 minutes afterwards so I could process all that happened and stop my hand from furiously shaking. EU plot points, great story elements, bone chilling acting are all part of your package deal my friends and I will be going back to see it another 3-5 times. I love this movie and it just barely beats ""Empire Strikes Back"". Thanks for reading if you found this helpful please like and go see the movie NOW!"
" Exactly what a life long fan of Star Wars wanted to see.
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,10,"It was basically all a life long Star Wars fan wanted to see excluding the haters that existed, exist and will continue to exist to the end of time that will say that it completely ruined the franchise and that ""Star Wars is dead"" and will never enjoy a new star wars film no matter what it is as long as it isn't the ORIGINAL EPISODE IV FROM 1977. Despite having a few similarities to episode IV (A New Hope) it does't keep it back from being fresh, with a lot of adventure, a sense of nostalgia and rewarding every fan with what he was hoping to see. Glad they finally released an awesome Star Wars film after the disaster of episodes I-III that do have their good moments too, and we're waiting to see what is to come in the next few years with episodes VIII and IX. 100% recommended and even if you haven't watched a Star Wars film before, start by watching Episodes IV-VI then I-III and finish up with episode VII (The Force Awakens) to continue the story next year. Thank you all, hope you are a true fan and that you will enjoy the movie, may the force be with you (it has truly awakened)."
" I can feel the hate swelling in you now! A review for the fans.
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,10,"The film is a masterpiece of escapism entertainment and so what if the template was borrowed in part from previous Star Wars movies (especially the original trilogy) – those movies worked!I'm not surprised at all with some of the hate filled reviews on here, I guess you can't please all of the people all of the time – only the vast majority of the developed world who can afford a ticket. Admittedly nostalgia levels were very high, but I felt as though they were warranted when I watched the finish article, as all boxes were ticked.*Potential very small spoiler* I particularly enjoyed the quite literal 'Force Awakening' scenes with the main force sensitive characters (not yet Jedi or Sith), who in some cases were literally fighting for their lives with zero training and a yet unknown midichlorian count.I'm looking forward to being able to share the experience with my 6 year old son one day soon, I'm sure he won't be dissecting the plot, drawing parallels with the originals and complaining about a ""lack of vision"".The torch has finally been passed to a new generation, well done JJ and company!"
" A Masterpiece That Breathed New Life Into This Franchise
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,10,"Seeing The Force Awakens was the greatest cinema experience I've ever had in my life, the theaters were full to the brim and everyone was dressed up but I was still cautiously optimistic but I was blown away by an incredible movie. I adored this movie, I think it's better than A New Hope and almost on Par with The Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi. This film understands that the most vital part of A Star Wars movie is the characters, we are given the time to care and love these new characters because they're developed perfectly, there character progression felt natural and they fit right in with the rest of the veterans. Kylo aren't was an amazing villain, mainly because he isn't completely a bad guy yet but instead a well rounded and complex character struggling with the overwhelming odds he faces. Of course since this is a Star Wars film the special effects are perfect and fit in just right with the rest of the environment. The performances are all fantastic, Daisy Ridley fit right into this role and was extremely likable, John Boyega was not only hilarious but also had a real complexity to him as a character and let us see things from a stormtroopers perspective. Harrison Ford came right back into Han Solo perfectly, he had amazing chemistry with the other characters and was just great to see him back again with a whole new layer of characterization added to him. Back I really have to be honest the greatest performance in this film was Adam Driver, he gave an amazing performance that rides just the right Lin between fragile and hostile and he made Kylo Ren a much better character to watch and was in my opinion worthy of an Oscar nomination. This film unlike the prequels understands that this film is part of a trilogy, so we are left hanging on certain things and left to wonder for a while, which in the long run will make the whole trilogy more satisfying. JJ Abrams was the perfect choice to direct this film, he paced this film quickly while occasionally slowing down to develop the characters more, he made sure that this film had the greatest Lightsaber battles in all the franchise. We got amazing new characters with great interaction with the old and makes me desperate to see the rest of this trilogy!100% / A+"
" What movie did all the naysayers actually see? Don't listen, it's incredible!
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,10,"So, my daughter and I just came out of Star Wars. My short summary is it is a perfect mix of old and new, and an excellent movie, probably one of the top 10 movies I've seen in 5 years or more.I'm not sure what those who gave this 1 to 7 stars are thinking, it is FAR better than your average movie. Of course it was going to have throwbacks to the others, heck, it has several of the same characters in starring roles. I also thought the new characters were outstanding, especially Daisy Ridley as Rey. I don't want to give a play-by-play analysis of the movie, just that JJ Abrams is truly a great director, the movie is beautiful, the story is engrossing, sets are amazing, and the overall pace and feel of the movie is top notch! Does the movie feel familiar....well yes of course it does, because IT IS a Star Wars movie, and yes, it has some similar scenes to the other movies. That is a GOOD thing, and they are very well done, and the humor is very well done, but not overly done or corny. Again, the movie is a wonderful blend of everything good about Star Wars. I've noticed over the last 20-30 years, especially in the last 10, there is a percentage of the USA population that is so cynical and negative about EVERYTHING! Those people will never be happy, I see it all the time in movie reviews that are so ridiculously over hyper-critical, I see it life everyday. My advice to those people is to chill, relax, sit back, and smell the roses....try to enjoy life! Star Wars: The Force Awakens IS the real deal."
" The force has awakened!
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,9,"Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'.Despite seeing 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' around the time it first came out (maybe a little after), there was a long time of being put off by the vitriolic hate it's gotten here and the practical war zone there is in order to review it (even when it was critically acclaimed). Finally mustering the courage, count me in as somebody who loved 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens'. A masterpiece? No. Better than the prequels? Absolutely, and although some may disagree this is saying a lot. The best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi?' Yes.'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is not the most original plot-wise. It has been criticised for being a re-hash of 'A New Hope', understandably. However, instead of being done in a cheap and slap-in-the-face way, it felt like an affectionate and nostalgic homage. Exemplified by bringing back major characters from the original trilogy in supporting roles. JJ Abrams, and this may be considered blasphemy, does a much better job here than he did with his 'Star Trek' reboot films, here he keeps the original spirit of the original trilogy intact while giving the film its own identity at the same time.While it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic at the expense of creating memorable characters, a fun story and brains and heart. The characters are memorable with easily identifiable leads, the original trilogy characters bringing a lot of affectionate nostalgia and a well executed if not iconic (not by Darth Vader standards anyhow) villain in Kylo Ren (unpredictable and dangerous but feeling he is morally justified).The story lacks originality but more than makes up for it in energy, non-stop heart-thumping thrills and excitement, generosity, a cheerfulness that is positively space operatic, vibrant charm and a few fresh twists along the way. In many ways it is a celebration of the universe while also an expansion of it. It is sometimes sentimental but never overly so, one crucial death scene is just heart-wrenching (particularly Chewbacca's reaction) and doesn't feel like a slap in the face to the character in question.Could the villains have been better written? Ren is fine but Snoke only just about works as a character thanks to the visual effects and especially the powerfully enigmatic with a touch of vulnerability performance of Andy Serkis, other than that the character is underwritten. Also felt that Gwendoline Christie's character was unnecessary, so limited was her screen time.Visually, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed with Abrams' visual storytelling shining far more here than it has in other films he's done. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Thank goodness that the dialogue contains little to none of the cheesiness heard in the prequels, and it even has more layers than that of the original trilogy.Acting also shines, with winning charismatic performances from John Boyega and particularly Daisy Ridley. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still have it, while Max Von Sydow shows himself to be a master of gestures and eye contact speaking louder than words. Adam Driver is a suitably menacing Ren and Serkis makes much of his somewhat underwritten character. Oscar Isaac gives a typically strong performance.In conclusion, a great film, the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and one of the best of the saga too. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
" JJ Abrams delivers on high expectations with a true Star Wars movie!
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,10,"Star Wars is back, as JJ Abrams achieves a small miracle in creating a movie that respects its original material, brings in a ton of new characters, makes it appealing for new viewers and sets up a story to build a new Star Wars trilogy on. Without giving away too many spoilers, the story revolves around a scavenger(Rey), a renegade stormtrooper(Finn) and a fighter pilot(Poe) in their quest to defeat an enemy with the power to endanger the galaxy. To be honest, superb acting has never been a strong point in any of the previous Star Wars movies. This trend has thankfully been broken, as the stellar cast give great performances throughout the whole movie. The newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, playing as Rey and Finn respectively, prove themselves more than capable of carrying the load in continuing the saga. They both show great chemistry together and give us extremely likable characters, with Rey bringing the heart of the film and Finn the abundant energy. Oscar Isaac, who plays Poe, is the veteran among the young cast and pulls of a cool and smartass X-wing pilot. And finally, the old cast returns to give this film a true Star Wars feel to it. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo and has not seemed to skip a beat since 1983, as he is as cheeky and badass as ever. His witty banter with Chewbacca is a pleasure to watch, but Ford also brings a strong emotional performance this time too. Carrie Fisher as Leia also returns, in a rather small role, and delivers some sweet scenes with Han and the new cast. However, the most complex character with the best arc in this movie, is the antagonist Kylo Ren. Ren, played by Adam Driver, gives us an extremely intimidating villain with a troubled past we are eager to discover. Ultimately, he serves us more than a Darth Vader wannabe.JJ Abrams, alongside Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt, wrote a fun and entertaining screenplay with plenty of emotional plot twists and content. Each main character has its own background and motivation, which develops over the duration of the film. A pleasant surprise to see is the humor used in the movie. The comedic relief in the film was used very effectively in developing chemistry and sympathy for the characters. It is also a sign that the movie does not take itself too seriously as the prequels did. The Force Awakens is filled with exhilarating action and moves with great pace during these scenes. Yet, Abrams knows to slow it down during scenes conveying intense emotion giving the audience time to process all that is thrown at them. These combined make it easy to understand the main characters' motivations, making the emotional investment so much better.As is typical of Star Wars, the movie is full of awe inspiring visual images and astonishing sound editing, creating new sounds for laser beams, light sabers, and alien noises. The cinematography is equally impressive, showing beautiful landscape shots of new planets reminiscent of the original trilogy. The cinematographer, Daniel Mindel, also shows us a diverse array of shots, giving heart-pounding POV shots inside the cockpit and nice long shots of the battlefield giving it a great scope while avoiding confusion caused by the numerous explosions.John Williams makes a welcome return to the Star Wars franchise with a bombastic new score, but also with nicely timed inserts of his famous original music to bring up emotional heartwarming feeling among the old- school fans. In conclusion, The Force Awakens is a return to form for the Star Wars franchise, as JJ Abrams gives his tribute to the original Star Wars, leading to a fanboys' dream. This beautiful reunion of old characters combined with the introduction of promising new characters results in a nostalgic and emotional adventure trip that left me excited for what is coming next. To quote Jimmy Kimmel, this movie was probably ""the most anticipated sequel since the New Testament"". So expect this movie to be under the most intense scrutiny by reviewers as they dissect the movie to its core to find the tiniest flaws. Nobody wants to be ""Phantom Menaced"" again. In the end, The Force Awakens delivers as a fantastic Star Wars film and a worthy addition to the franchise. It is definitely the best Star Wars movie since 1983 and, in my opinion, the best one since The Empire Strikes Back."
" Can't please anyone
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,10,"when the prequels came out, all of you harsh critics HATED them because of the story lines and the horrible and overused CGI (which I hated as well). It was missing the nostalgia and gritty production that made the originals so great. JJ was HAND PICKED by Lucas, after Lucas himself gave Disney rough outlines of how the 3 movies should go based on the Star Wars universe. After that, he was hands off. Now, you people hating JJ and wanting Lucas back, are the same people who complained about the prequels and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which was Lucas. Obviously there is no pleasing you. ""BOOOOO the prequels aren't like the originals"" and now ""BOOOO VII is too much like the originals"". Absolutely ridiculous. I will admit, there is no beating the originals. They were ORIGINAL. Nothing like them had come out yet. They were adventurous and feel good and exciting. I want to go out and fight the Republic after watching them. But it's 40 years later. They had to please the people who were upset with the prequels, and had to find a way to bridge the gap between that generation and this. This was a wonderful movie. The CGI was limited. The acting was great. The scenery was beautiful, as was the cinematography. The only things I disliked were: 1) Han's death and how unceremonious it was. 2) Carrie Fisher's acting. She was great in the originals but seems to have forgotten how to in this one. 3) Luke's absence from pretty much the whole movie, and the 3 minute staring scene he has at the end. 4) Finn was EXTREMELY overacted. His character makes no sense. He's trying too hard to be funny and to fit in, and from someone that has always been a storm trooper, this makes no sense. Han, Rey, and Poe are wonderful, and have great chemistry. Kylo Ren's character is intimidating at first, until he throws a complete temper tantrum, which I think should not have been in the movie or should have been written differently to make him fearsome, not weak and childish. All in all, this was worth the hype. I went in excited, and left happy and excited. Don't let all of these negative reviews get to you, they can't be pleased unless they wrote their own film, which I assume wouldn't be that great considering they spend all of their time bashing great movies and not getting paid millions of dollars to write and direct."
" The force has indeed awakened for Star Wars, and the haters continue to embarrass themselves. XD
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,10,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fabulous film and is a good dose of escapism from mundane everyday life, just like The Original Trilogy was. We can forget all our problems when seeing this movie. The Force Awakens sparks a joy for the child in all of us which many of us have been waiting for since The Empire strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. There couldn't have been a story more worthy of the subtitle 'Episode VII'.After the whole Trade Negotiations rubbish that plagued the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. J.J. Abrams reinvigorates the assaulted franchise and gives us some of the most powerful moments ever seen in the saga.Don't give in to the trolling of the prequel or original trilogy fanboys. They're just upset that somebody did a much stronger job than Lucas could have managed on his own. They couldn't tell a good movie apart from Transformers 3 & 4, or any Michael Bay movie for that matter. We are entitled to our own opinion and mustn't succumb to these 'emotion vampires' that do their best and ultimately fail to make a difference in the end.The Force Awakens is a refreshingly fun film that as a form of escape in this day and age plagued by terrorism, cyber-terrorism, LGBT discrimination and racism. Star Wars is a welcoming series that isn't conformed by anything in our world ; it's a self-realising ecstasy that will always be there for us like an old friend. 10 stars"
" Is The Force Awakens really That Bad
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,1,"The answer is no, it is worse. So, I hate films that are made purely for cash and to rip off other films and what without acknowledgement. And I have a strong dislike for hack directors. Yet, despite that we went in with hope and walked out knowing all the bad reviews were correct. The acting and story is hilarious stupid, both in seeing what awful art can be made by JJ Abrams as well as laughing at a genius director and actors who do not even know how the force works."
" Yep. Disregard the laughably biased, contrarian ""reviews"". The Force is strong with this awesome movie!
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,10,"This is a great movie. It's also an extremely popular and mainstream movie, and therefore is going to bring out people that will needlessly nitpick it to death in an attempt to look smart or edgy. There are legitimate criticisms you can hurl at this movie, but people that give it a 1 or 2/10 shouldn't be taken remotely seriously, as they are completely ignoring what the movie did right and putting a magnifying glass over a handful of beyond minor flaws.Star Wars fans will find a lot to love hear. Great set pieces/locations, excellent costume design, flawed and relatable characters, hilarious banter/quips, dramatic and complex relationships, and a ton of space adventure fun. It's the best Star Wars film since Empire, hands down."
" Did every mom's basement troll see the same movie??? LOL
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,10,"The amount of negative reviews that are out there are simply hilarious. What were the mom's basement trolls looking for in the movie, a complete exposition of the 30 years that have passed since Return of the Jedi? If you were expecting that, then we would have a 9 hour plus movie.In this latest installment history always repeats itself, with the adage if it did work the last time then lets build a bigger one. Only to find out that it will only fail. Remember that this is the start of the 3rd trilogy, and the introduction of new characters, plots and worlds must take place in the first act, if you don't, then you will not know what's going on in all the other installments!Solid script, direction, story, production and especially the soundtrack. It is easier to be negative than to be positive and those that write negative reviews are only looking for their 15 minutes of 'fame'This movie is perfect, end of story. 5/5 stars"
" Nope. Totally Overrated. Rogue One Was Better, and This Was in Some Ways a Disservice to the Franchise. Big Miss.
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,5,"I can't believe I'm going to say this because I heard so many great things about Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but I actually liked Rogue One, which I just saw a few weeks ago better. Cameos alone don't make a movie good. If you're not doing anything constructive with them, that doesn't make the movie good, and it could worsen it. This movie was a mess. My main complaints, however, were first of all ""Fin"". I was hoping his overacting and overreacting would calm down or disappear after the first 10 minutes as an opening side character, but they kept him in. His acting and demeanor did not fit the Star Wars universe, and he did not conduct himself like a disciplined Stormtrooper would. He was an awful choice as a lead character here. Fortunately, ""Ray"" was much better and helped to at least make the movie bearable and watchable to offset him. Second of all, what an awful call to kill off a main character in this. It was totally unlawful and unjust to the Star Wars universe. The way the scene was handled, in addition to proceeding scenes was careless and done without any effort, like it was nothing. That's a joke, and I was really disappointed. I understand the actors are just doing the script and everything, but it was bad for everyone involved. And my last big gripe with the movie was that it was just all over the place in that too many things were happening because of coincidence or at just the right time with no explanation why. There were so many instances of this that it's not worth going over because it would take forever. In addition, I'm sorry but Carrie Fisher's character in this was so uninspired and the ""original characters"" often talked like cardboard characters. This is not a criticism because I love and have a lot of respect for them, and I think this more has to do with the production, script, and directing, which seems to have just wanted to add these characters at all costs, even if the story wasn't a good fit for them. On a plus side, there definitely was a lot of action and the girl ""Ray"" really saved the movie from being a total failure. It was entertaining, and it had its moments, Star Wars moments, the end was good, but this is a totally overrated movie. I can say with certainty right now that Rogue One was much better. This one was almost a disaster, but I have too much respect for Ford, Fisher, and Luke to call it that. It was fun to see them all again, but I think they could have been used and served much better. I'm actually going to forget I ever saw some of the events of this movie if I ever watch another Star Wars. This is like an independent work of fiction to the Star Wars universe. 5/10"
" Best film of the Star Wars saga
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,10,"I know the fans of the original trilogy may find this as blasphemy, but yes, The Force Awakens is the most well made film of the Star Wars saga. This film has all the goodness of the original movies, characters who are easily likable, incredible effects, John Williams' rousing musical score and a great time at the cinema, enjoyable with our families and friends. But there are things which are even better than the original movies. Interaction between the lead characters is so natural, you got to commend the writers and the director J J Abrams for their amazing work. Most blockbuster films today tend to focus on spectacle and visual effects enhanced action over tender human moments. This film balances action and human drama amazingly well. The new characters are extremely memorable, the new actors Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are wonderful in their roles, along with Oscar Isaac. BB8 is extremely adorable, dare I say even better than R2D2. Adam Driver as Kylo Ren is a worthy villain, with the best motion capture actor in the world Andy Serkis, doing what he does best, as Supreme Leader Snoke. The visual effects on display here are incredible, and unlike the prequels which were ruined by their CGish feel, this one relies on practical effects. Almost everything in this film looks real, the stormtroopers look real, because they are real mean in armor, kudos for J J Abrams for not using CGI even for closeup shots of troopers. This films plot is somewhat reminiscent of A New Hope, but still the themes here are different. The plot here opens many doors for the sequels, and I cannot wait to see what the next films will do with these characters. J J Abrams is a better director than George Lucas, and that will be very clear when you see the film. Oscars are going to lineup for this film. Its that good. Expect nominations for Best Picture, Best Original Score, Best Visual effects and sound categories, but I am still being modest here. This film deserves every award it gets. A film as widely anticipated and hyped as this can rarely ever be this good."
" Why this is my favourite Star Wars movie
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,10,"I'll start by saying I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember. I remember back to when I was 3 and watching the movies non stop, playing with my Star Wars Lego, action figures, lightsabers and costumes made by my mum and always loving every second of it. I'm a fan of many franchises from Marvel to DC to Doctor Who but the biggest fandom of all has always been Star Wars. I may not have been around when the original movies were released but I am honestly one of the biggest Star Wars fans in the world.When I read online that Disney had bought Lucas Film and announced a third trilogy, I was mad excited, constantly wondering what it would be about and laughing at the fact George Lucas said in an old behind the scenes feature, without any hesitation, that there would never be an Episode 7. Ever since September 2012, I have been eagerly awaiting this new installment. incredibly excited at the release of every new trailer and then the moment finally came where I would watch the movie for the first time. I didn't know the plot, I avoided all the spoilers I could and when I saw it, my mind was blown up like a Deathstar. The movie was everything I'd hoped for. Thankfully, nothing was spoiled for me. JJ Abrams who directed the Star Trek films which are some of my top favourites along with the writer of The Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark, made a film I loved every second of. It felt great to have Star Wars back again. I had the most fun I've ever had watching a movie before and I'm not just saying that. I've given it a few days to sink in, I've seen it three times and my thoughts are still the same. Although I'm sorry to see on IMDb so many of the common reviews are the negative ones. People are saying this movie is a reboot of A New Hope (even though the original cast is obviously in it) but they also say this because the story is similar. I understand their points but they've blown it way out of proportion. For example, yes there is Star Killer base which is basically another Death Star, yes Kylo Ren is a strong, evil and memorable villain like Darth Vader, yes Rey is from a desert planet like Luke and put there for reasons unknown at the time but I didn't see the First Order take over a Resistance ship and kidnap Poe before he gave information to BB8 who went in an escape pod and was bought by Rey's Uncle Owen to later meet an old jedi who took Rey and BB8 with him on board a smuggler's ship to deliver BB8 to a planet destroyed by Star Killer base to wind up on the base, saving Poe, escaping, losing the Old Jedi to Kylo Ren so Rey can come back on an x-wing to blow up Star Killer base. I didn't see any of that. It's less similar to A New Hope than people say. A New Hope was the seed of the franchise so all films are a root grown from the seed, they all have their similarities. In fact, Star Wars has always been about an unlikely hero destined to become something greater to help the forces of good to stop an evil army. This movie is a new generation of that which is exactly what the fans said they want. So don't be fooled by people who say it's another A New Hope. But then again, you can't argue with the fanboys because one minute the prequels are too different and now The Force Awakens is too similar. Of course you just can't please everyone but don't be fooled into thinking this movie is everything the haters say it is. I'm a die hard fan and I love Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I love the acting from everyone especially the phenomenal Daisy Ridley, I loved all the characters, especially Kylo Ren, the very evil villain you love to hate, who I had bought posters, costumes and toys of months prior to seeing the movie, I loved the story, the humour and the directing. I loved the combination of practical and CGI effects. BB8 is not only believable because he's a practical prop, but he is an adorable character and always fun to watch. It felt like Star Wars and I loved it. I could have only wished to see a little more of Captain Phasma, R2, C3PO, Leia and the new Starkiller base but other than that, I loved this movie and I cannot wait to buy it on BluRay and I cannot wait for Episode VIII coming out in 2017. I am not sugar coating, I loved this movie. I give, without any hesitation, Star Wars: The Force Awakens a 10/10. I do believe this is my favourite Star Wars film of all time so far. As I said in my YouTube video blog, ""If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll love this movie and if you see this movie and you hate it, you are not a Star Wars fan."" Haha!"
" J.J. Abrams made The Ultimate Star Wars sequel. This is the film you are looking for.
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,10,"What J.J. Abrams achieved is astonishing, and something to remember for all eternity. I can't talk about specific things, because this is like the ultimate spoiler film, but... The story is perfect, yes it shares a few plot lines with episode IV, but the film is so original and creative, taking those plot lines to new surprising directions and adding so much new stuff. I mean they have so much to explain on the next films, which is exciting, because to me the ultimate franchise, is one where each film answers as many questions as it raises, so that you have mysteries and things to really looking for, to discover to be surprised. The pace of this film is amazing, it's fast paced but in such a great and complete way. The new main characters shine like the sun. They are lovable from the first frame, and instantly iconic, each representing so much. Especially the two main leads, and even more Rey, as she truly is what this franchise needed, a huge female character besides Leia. The villain is more than perfect, and he has the power and potential to be even bigger than Darth Vader (even so, Darth Vader will always be Darth Vader). But BB-8 probably stands as my favorite new character, because hes so awesome, but if it weren't him, i would either go with Rey or Finn, probably Rey. And Maz Kanata is so cool. And of course there's the original characters, but i cant talk about that. And there's a ton more of new characters, the screenplay focus on the characters needed for the current story, while presenting tons more, that make you wanting to see more of them, and when their time comes you will. One of the main reasons these new characters are so great, is the actors that perform them. They all give performances so perfect you just feel like this is the best casting ever made. These actors, especially the leads, will have some of the biggest careers ever. Of the original actors, Harrison Ford shines the most, and gives probably his best performance as Han Solo yet, i mean he's just so amazing.And a curious thing, these time the stormtroopers hit everything, and they are so surprisingly lethal and menacing! There's genius humour to spare, almost everyone (even the Dark Side) gets to make brilliant jokes. But Harrison, Chewbacca, Finn and BB-8 are in this order the ones that make you laugh the most. There's also many jokes made out of references to the older movies, that are so funny. And this film made something really iconic, there's tons of cameos of big stars throughout the film, that are almost impossible to see at first, but brilliant when you see them. You can make a game out of who can spot the most cameos. But obviously there's also tons of emotional heft, and drama, done in one of the most natural ways I've ever seen, you will cry a lot, not only for the nostalgia factor, (which is really big) but because the film really is something you can relate to, and there's so many powerful scenes and a constant sense of emotional heft. And then there's the action, my favorite scene is the first with the millennium falcon, which is one of the best action scenes ever made. There's plenty of action, and they are all perfect, original, creative, and so much more. They are so perfectly and thrillingly choreographed! I could talk about forever about how great the action is. One of the reasons, is the way J.J shot them, there's so many iconic camera movements here, is astonishing, i've never seen anything like this.There's so many great vistas, sets and new planets, and the Starkiller Base is, well, the most awesome thing ever, It makes the Death Star look like a SPA.There's so many iconic shots, so beautiful they can make you cry of joy. The cinematography is brilliant. The production values are through the roof. The visual and practical effects are so great you just think there are no effects and its all real. Really give them an Oscar already! The score is as great as you would expect from John Williams, even though there are no distinctive iconic themes like the ones we already know. The sound is also amazing, even though there are some new effects that could have been different (the ones from the blasters) but, give them an Oscar already! This is the ultimate Star wars sequel, filled with mind blowing twists (get ready for the mother of all twists), brilliant writing, comedy, action, iconic characters everything you could wish for in a star wars movie. J.J. Abrams really has to get all the credit possible for what he did, because its just everything you want and them more. It's about honoring the past while setting the future, and the new cast/characters can continue the legacy in the best way possible.I've rarely seen a film where everything is so perfect. You just will want more and more and more. This is one of the best films of all time, and the next one has all the ingredients to be even bigger). The first is the first, so i probably put this one as my favorite next to episode IV. Also, if this film will break all records at the box office, thanks to the film itself, but the cliffhanger ending in special, episode VIII is bound to break all of this films records. This is an experience without equal, one to be seen as many times as you can, because it will only get better each time."
" Ignore the negatives, this movie is AMAZING
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,10,"Only people that ""think"" they are fans are giving this movie negative reviews. This movie is absolutely incredible and I don't think anyone could have done any better with it. If your nit picking little things you should really re-think your entire view. This was probably one of the hardest movies ever to remake and JJ Abrams did an awesome job. He had a lot to live up to, and a lot to follow up.....and he did it!!For those of you bashing any of the story lines.. if you had the slightest idea of what you were talking about you would know George Lucas already had Most of this story written, and J.J. followed most of it. So complaining about the story is silly. You should sit back and enjoy the movie and appreciate you were given the opportunity in time to view it. So stop picking things apart and enjoy this movie, I saw it last night and cannot wait to see it again in a few hours!"
" The franchise is rescued.
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,10,"Episode 7 has redeemed a franchise that for many hardcore traditional fans had become a niggling source of disappointment.This is everything that 1, 2 & 3 weren't. The acting is solid - something we've never really associated with the franchise. The music is not clichéd - there are some new themes which will most likely catch on. The storyline is coherent and promises longevity and the action is gripping. From the opening scene you realize that 32 years after Return of the Jedi and the utter disappointment of 1, 2 & 3, Star Wars fans are finally in for a treat. It is a return to what worked,The directing is solid as is the dialogue, in fact probably the best dialogue in all seven films."
" Relax, weirdos. It's just a space fantasy movie.
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,10,"10/10, if only to irk all the whining fanboys on here.I cannot believe the outright rage and anger over this movie. Grown men getting all bent out of shape and throwing tantrums because the latest installment of a movie series that features a guy in a shag rug outfit, garbage cans on wheels and a ninja gremlin that can lift spaceships with his mind didn't meet their expectations. Relax. I mean seriously. Its just a space fantasy movie. Its not supposed to clean up at the Oscars or have a story like a Pulitzer winning novel. Its a big, fun, goofy ride with explosions and lasers in space and that's all.Look what introducing too many new characters, spaceships and concepts did for Lucas in the prequels. They apparently according to the fans all stunk so why cry now when they stick to the original winning formula. You willingly bought your ticket so don't cry and demand your money back because it didn't meet many peoples quite frankly outrageous expectations. Be thankful you even have a new Star Wars movie. Most people couldn't even draw the Millennium Falcon let alone bring it to life on the big screen.Another thing I would like to bring to the foaming at the mouth fan boys attention is that the prequels were largely downright awful and they were made by its creator, who sold out and walked away by the way because he knew the story was pretty much tapped out and you know it, and if this new movie sucks and the prequels suck and the only decent films were the first three (many thought those sucked too by the way) then maybe that means Star Wars just simply sucks and it was over in the 80's and that the fan boys should simply move along and find something else to fill the voids in their lives. Part of the problem is that Lucas much like his fans started to take this franchise way too seriously and it wouldn't appear that there is just no pleasing any Star Wars fan.Is the action and story line supposed to be realistic and believable? Heck no! Was it fun and loud and did it bring you back to the wacky Star Wars world for a couple hours? Yes. Thats all its supposed to be is a big, fun, goofy space fantasy to lose yourself in for a couple hours and nothing more so stop taking it so seriously, get over it and stop whining.And some of the plot hole arguments on here are ridiculous. Hundreds of comments about how does Rey know so much about the Millennium Falcon? Well because as very clearly stated in the film it sat in pretty much her backyard, owned by her employer for much of her life so you think she might have been on it more than a few times. I mean seriously are Star Wars fans really that thick? Even a 12 year old would have a hard time missing that glaring plot point.Personally I liked the movie and thought it was fun. It brought me back to my childhood but I certainly did not hang my happiness or mental health on whether or not it would be good or totally change the format and introduce all new concepts. I saw Han and Chewy and Leia and Luke and a bunch of new characters and I ate my popcorn, drank my drink, watched the explosions and went home satisfied.Star Wars was never intended to be the pinnacle of human story telling with an Oscar winning script, nor was it intended to change the world or be a crutch for people to rely on to bring meaning to their lives.Just enjoy two hours of incredible escapism and get a life already."
" Near flawless film. Star Wars is back ! ** spoilers
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,7,"This film was nearly flawlessly executed . I have little to no complaints about it. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver really shine here . The opening scene on Jakoo rivals the opening scene from a new hope . I saw this opening night and it was the best movie experience I've ever had . The film combines old Star Wars themes such as : friendship, loyalty , adventure and brings it to a whole new time . Poe and Finn's friendship seems natural and real.Harrison Ford was fantastic and his performance was as good or better than the originals. The film also has great secondary characters of which my favorites are Snoke, General Hux and Maz. I am looking to see Luke Skywalker back in action in the Last Jedi and my only real criticism of the film is that I wish we saw more of him , but the last scene is so terrific it makes up for it . Overall the best Star Wars film since Jedi."
" This is the Star Wars movie you were looking for.
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,10,"This is a Star Wars movie of EPIC proportions and was awesome to say the least. The new big 3 are great, Rey and Finn work brilliantly together, and the old big 3 are at their best. Luke Skywalker is only in it very briefly at the end but looks fantastic, I can't wait to see him take a major role in episode 8. Kylo Ren makes Vader look tame, he is evil to the core and just a great villain who is very powerful with the dark side. You certainly won't be disappointed with this Star Wars movie, it's right up there with Empire Strikes Back as the best Star Wars movies ever made."
" Why didn't they just officially remake A New Hope?
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,1,"IMHO with regard to quality not profit this franchise is obeying the law of diminishing returns. This current travesty has no redeeming features unless you are the sort of person that has an obsession with rectifying perceived gender and racial imbalances within popular entertainment. If the rationale is that people can only relate to protagonists that resemble themselves I do wonder why white males should be expected to relate to Rey and Finn. The original white male creators unsurprisingly created a lot of white male characters. In a similar fashion Kathleen Kennedy has produced a film with a main protagonist in her own particular image. Indeed I could almost suspect that Rey is nothing more than Kathleen Kennedy's avatar running around within the Star Wars universe. She certainly resembles Rey more than George Lucas resembled the three leads from the original trilogy.Personally I do not think it helped that the creation of Rey and her story was entrusted to three males. It has been suggested that J J Abrams was overcompensating for criticism he had received for supposedly gratuitously focusing on partially undressed women in his previous film. I do think the character of Rey was handled with kid gloves. Presumably a female writer would have been less susceptible to overcompensation and might have allowed other characters to occasionally outshine the new chosen one. It might also have helped if they had gone to the bother of creating more than one female protagonist in the first part of this new trilogy so that Rey was not unduly burdened with the responsibility of representing the entire female audience. Although I have not seen the original all the way through for a while I have caught individual scenes while channel surfing. Funnily enough more often than not the scenes involved Luke getting beaten up or derided by some other character. For most of the original film he seems to be a milquetoast character and even after the subsequent films came out I was always under the impression as an eighties child that everybody still preferred Han. In this new film one of the three leads was apparently initially supposed to die before the end while the other male lead seems to be included for comic relief. Anyway, Rey does not appear to need anyone else unlike Luke whose only real moment of triumph was achieved after the timely intervention of a helpful Jedi ghost.Rey is not derided or assisted. She is given things that have been very important to characters from the original trilogy. It is repeatedly emphasised that she does not need assistance from any man. Unfortunately there are not really any other female characters who could assist her instead. Princess Leia is too busy. Everybody seems to like and respect her and she appears to be at least as much of a prodigy as Anakin was in the prequels. However his competence was offset by the fact that he was a child in the first film and then an extremely flawed student in the other two. And surely nobody in their right mind would want to deliberately create a character that reminded people of Anakin from the prequels.Everything seems to revolve around Rey and if you don't mind the type of blunt girl power message that used to be championed by the Spice Girls then I feel that you would probably like this film more than I could. I am afraid that I suspect that if the main protagonist's gender had been male there would have been a far more critical response to this turkey from the professional film critics.The script appears more like a first draft than the finished product and I can not understand why adult men who are supposedly playing adult men should talk to each other as if they were in their early teens. Is Mr Abrams trying to imitate Joss Whedon now?Having previously had the unpleasant experience of watching Super 8 it does not surprise me in the least that this film makes no sense whatsoever. This director has again produced another mindless frantic action film like he did with the Star Trek reboot.For creators who are seemingly obsessed with diversity issues I do not understand their decision to cast John Boyega in a role akin to a runaway slave and then to rub it in by making him the foil for Rey while also acting as comic relief. It might improve things if he becomes her love interest but as others have already noted there did not seem to be much indication of that in this particular film.Was it really necessary to have another Death Star? If so, why didn't they just totally replicate the original concept instead of expecting the audience to accept the mind-bogglingly stupid Starkiller Base? If everything else worked I would probably hate the film for that inanity alone. The original trio needn't have bothered fighting the Empire as everything is more or less returned to the same state of affairs that existed in the original film. I would imagine that more people would have been bothered by the blatant similarities between this film and A New Hope if they had not been distracted by the gender and racial swaps.Apparently Han is now a geriatric smuggler while Luke is sat sulking in a corner while all his achievements from the original trilogy are totally erased. Billions of people are wiped out without any emotional impact on the watching audience and the idea that the main antagonist could be redeemed while bearing any responsibility at all for that seems utterly ridiculous.It would have probably made more sense to just officially remake the original trilogy while swapping Luke and Leia for two black sisters. After all the voice of James Earl Jones is one of the highlights of the original trilogy."
" Get over it already, fanboys. The movie was massively entertaining and better than the originals.
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,10,"I've watched the original Star Wars many times growing up, and I know the story inside out like anyone else. Classic films that many people like my self have been wanting back. I saw the movie today and walked away satisfied and eager for the next one. I read some of these highest rated reviews and it's literally awful how full of yourself and pessimistic some of you are. You're giving the movie a 1 star, for what? Most of you have a delusion of 30 years of fanboy pathetic bias that nothing released will live up to your laughable, impossible to please standards.First of all, this is a movie, it's pure entertainment. It isn't a real galaxy, it isn't real people, it's just a movie guys. Because it doesn't add up to every painful fan boy theory you wrote in a thesis somewhere, doesn't mean the movie didn't deliver. You cannot take it this seriously. Yes, the movie followed the same guidelines to the plot as #4 that made the original successful, but there is plenty of juicy story to build on that is completely original. It pays tribute to the old, and you care about the new offspring of the main characters going forward. The story does develop perfectly from #6, 30 years later with the offspring and new heroes to root for. It gives us the best x- wing, tie fighter, millennium falcon, storm trooper, battle scene fights in any of the movies. It's modern movie making and CGI at it's best, but still giving us the unique Star Wars elements we want to see. The John Williams score is epic and masterful with the movie. The story ends for old characters in awe, and it starts new interesting story lines for other old characters continuing the story, like Chewy and Luke. This movie had to get people excited about Star Wars again. The 2000 movies weren't very good, so it had to go back to the guidelines of the original story. I suspect this movie will reflect closet to the originals story guidelines, because it had to deliver what we wanted, and the next two will develop entirely new unique adventures and story for the new heroes that will, through the characters family lineage, constantly pay tribute to the old. After reading some of these, it seems people put the originals on a pedestal. They were very good movies, but not everything was explainable or made to prove science and follow every law of nature. It's a movie. It is made to be fun, and you can't take movies that seriously. Most movies going back, including the originals, are all like this, it doesn't always have to follow physics like it seems hardcore Star Wars fans think. I don't think the movie was perfect,I would have liked to see Fin and Rey's relationship go deeper so I cared about it more. But it was very close, and the main pieces we've been waiting for have come back and are as good as before. Nothing will replace a classic, but we don't have to because this story is excellent on it's own.Just appreciate what it is, it's definitely the best Star Wars film made. It was exciting, extremely fun and satisfying, and I loved every second of it. Rey, Poe, and Fin are going to be fun to watch, and I can't wait to see Luke's role in the next one training Rey and seeing how she can harness the force against Han and Leia's kid. I took my girlfriend to see this movie, she had only seen part of the originals but somewhat knows the back story, and she knew exactly what was going on and absolutely loved it. They made it very watchable and entertaining for any level of fan. Very good movie."
" Best Movie I have ever seen!
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,10,"Before going into this movie, I was a bit nervous. I did not want this film to be a bit of a disappointment like The Phantom Menace, not saying I hate that movie. After walking out of the IMAX theater, I was amazed. Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is my favorite film I have ever seen, and I have seen many of the greats. The story takes place, 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi. The First Order, the new Galactic Empire, is looking for the map that leads to the missing Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker, while the Resistance is trying to get it as well. First off, the casting is amazing, especially Daisy Ridley, who plays Rey. The story was great, and don't care about ""the plot being too alike to A New Hope"" because pretty much all of the Star Wars plots are like that. The characters were very well thought, especially Kylo Ren. The twist is amazing, not spoiling it. I have no negatives what so ever. Unfortunately, I can only give this film 10, and not higher. I loved it, so I saw it again in IMAX. I highly recommend this film."
" Star Wars The Force Awakens is the best star wars movie.
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,10,"The Force Awakens is the best of all the star wars movies by far . All the new actors in this movie made it even more enjoyable, especially Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. They were the breakout stars of the movie. Adam driver was a complex villain and thankfully will be in future episodes. Daisy Ridley did a brilliant job as the main hero of this movie and her performance was amazing. The overall story and action was spectacular. The new cast and story is what makes this a great space epic . Oscar Isaac was also a welcomed new addition to the cast, he did a fantastic job as the best pilot of the resistance. All the original cast of the first trilogy did a good job, even if their part was brief. I also loved new droid BB 8, he was funny and a hilarious side character. John Boyega was awesome as the ex storm trooper.All in all, this was an excellent movie."
" The Force Awakens is an awesome flick.
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,10,"I saw some of these moronic reviews on IMDb for this movie from 'so called' critics and I laughed out loud at their reasons why they hated it. But these reviewers are just amateurs who try to bash a great movie. What did the professional reviewers write? USA Today 4 out of 4 stars, the Guardian 5 out of 5 Stars, The SF Chronicle 5 out of 5 stars, The Wall Street Journal 5 out of 5 stars, the headline - ""The Star Wars you have been waiting for"". If the movie is as bad as the amateur critics on IMDb states, why does it have an 8.1 rating here? Why did this movie gross over $2 billion dollars if word of mouth regarding the flick mirrored the crappy reviews found on IMDb? These reviewers who tell you that The Force Awakens it is a bad flick are just bitter people who live in the basement of their moms' home. I have seen the movie twice including IMAX and love it. The movie is 150 minutes long but feels 90 minutes. It's a great film – the two best movies of 2015 were Mad Max and The Force Awakens."
" The best Star Wars movie ever!!!!
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,10,"At long last we have been given a Star Wars movie that takes full advantage of what the universe has to offer. JJ Abrams has shown that he can handle a movie of this kind and balance all the elements that makes up the movie. I was, more or less, at the edge of my seat from start to finish, since I didn't want to miss the story when it really kicked off. And the movie kept me in suspense in a brilliant way, so that I never had a moments rest, and thus was fully entertained from start to finish. What really made me happy to see was that lots of the problems found in previous movies wasn't a problem here. In episode 1 - 3, it bothered me that the special effects had taken over to such a degree, that any story and acting was strangled. This is not the case in TFA. Here the effects are balanced so that, there are enough to blow you away, but tempered so that the story shines through and the actors get to show what they can do. In episode 1-6 we mostly see either under- or overacting. Of course some did a great job. It was a joy to see a movie where the acting was as it should be. In short, JJ Abrams has made the movie Star Wars fans have deserved and waited for."
" Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,10,"Loved it! Can't praise it enough Sat there for 2 hours like a little kid on Xmas morningThe new characters are engaging, funny, and human, something I now see that was lacking from the prequelsI'm old enough to remember seeing A New Hope at the cinema when it was first released, I came of the cinema last night with the same sense of excitement.Glad to see that its dong well, and there will be lots more to come I see sadly there are a few folks on this list trolling the film, you guys need to let go of your hate, life is short, you're supposed to suspend your disbelief, let go of your cynicism, and simply enjoy yourself, because if you let this film take you in, its simply stunning.....exciting and emotional...pure good old fashioned escapism...isn't that what it's all about?Well done JJ"
" Memories Of The Past Attached To A Wonderful Film
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,10,"The Force Awakens is the illustration of an emotional moment for me. Whenever I watch it I feel ... something. An emotion that is very personal, dark, sad, yet very happy. This film was the turning point from being the optimistic, emotional mute, happy yet dumb kid to the anxious, critical, emotional yet still optimistic teen. So much of my personal thoughts and feeling where forced onto this movie. So much memories of drawing Rey, Finn, and Kylo Ren from the trailers with my friends. So much memories of countless lunches just debating what the plot will be about and who the narrator was from the trailers is. It took over my life. Now at this moment in my life I was told to be more of a man. I had a strict rule with myself that no crying, no bad thoughts, no emotional things would be allowed in this body of mine. During my first midnight premiere, dressed up and pumped up. I cried for the first time I can ever remember. It all got released and it changed me. It's one of the most important moments in my 15 years of being alive. I also gained an interest in film that has never left me to this day. Oh and the film was amazing by the way."
" It ain't broke, so JJ didn't fix it
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,10,"I have heard quite a bit of hatred about this movie being too much like episode IV: A New Hope, but the one question I have is what would YOU do differently? Need I remind everybody that when George Lucas tried to do something completely different than the original trilogy for the prequel trilogy, it blew up in his face. What direction can a villain faction such as the first order head into rather than another menacing death star that happens to be not only a death star? In my opinion it was a good decision. I have also heard hatred that the dialogue was meant for kids and it was. But why is this a bad thing? This was done in the original trilogy and nobody cared because of the breakthrough. Without giving too much away other than the new death star, I will say that many were a bit tough on this movie because of the high expectations. Is it the best of the series? No way, but it is way better than the prequels including Revenge of the Sith. All the humorous cracks fit in perfectly to give us a reasonable mix of old and new. Yes, there is new as well. What also stood out for me was JJ's ability to strive for an independence of green screen photography and using more real environments as backgrounds for scenes. This gives a more realistic feel that the other movies lacked most of the time. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Thank you JJ for making us feel like kids again at the movies.A note to IMDb: Please look at what percentage of voters have rated this movie 8 stars or higher. Why do you place the 1-star reviews under the best category just because many people have responded to them? It has a 92% rating on rotten tomatoes and an accurate 8.1 on IMDb. You are inadvertently spreading hatred for a kids movie that most people really enjoyed. Rethink please."
" Exciting, Entertaining, and Engaging. 10/10
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,10,"This movie was by far the best movie of 2015. Go in with normal expectations and you will come out deeply content. Loved every bit of it. The movie has all the big bangs, flight sequences and special effects that you come to expect from a great Star Wars movie. I rarely watch a movie twice (the last one was The Dark Knight) but I cannot wait to re-visit this epic for another round. Counting the days until the next one!"
" A Wonderful Return To A Galaxy We Missed Dearly!
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"The Force Awakens promised a lot and delivered more for both a first time Star Wars viewer or a die hard fan of the series.This movie had all the ingredients of success right from the get go. A captivating opening crawl, fresh characters who were well written and well acted, humor for all ages, relatable heroes and villains, nostalgia moments, and an awesome soundtrack by the incomparable John Williams. It was the first time in over 30 years where we had character development in a Star Wars movie that actually made you care about the heroes you were watching.JJ Abrams had a very tough job in his attempt to basically reboot the series and wipe the terrible impression left by the Prequels on even the most loyal fans. Not only did he succeed, but he actually managed to surpass expectations while providing a perfect balance between old and new, taking big risks with the movie's villain and integrating the new cast with the established heroes. You will care about the characters, you will care about the story, and the ending will leave you craving more while answering some of the most burning questions fans were asking, and at the same time, creating new mysteries and questions to explore in the future.We missed THIS Star Wars, it's great to be back! Thanks JJ, you did it justice!"
" Spectacular film for the old and new generation
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"I can't believe it took someone 32 years to make a decent Star Wars movie. Finally, true fan and director J.J. Abrams gave us the film we have desperately been waiting for.The three main new characters were introduced in a great way that we loved them and cared for them in an instant. When any of the original characters showed up, everyone in the theater applauded.Everyone that reprises their role from the original trilogy were perfect, even the new coming leads did a great job.Remember those flashy, coordinated lightsaber duels we got in the previous six Star Wars films? Yeah, forget them cause the fight we got in The Force Awakens was brutal and dirty and excellent.It was everyone's dream to finally see The Millennium Falcon fly again with the use of the new technology of our time. I loved that the film respected the originals by using practical effects instead of special effects all the time (the prequels)Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is a great start to hopefully another trilogy (The Sequels) and even more Star Wars spin- offs."
" Tired of these fanboy hipsters
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"I have read through some of these comments and WHAT A JOKE! The lot of you. Every Star Wars fan since 1999 - 2005, has been endlessly crying wanting it to be like 4,5 and 6! So what does Abrams do? Makes a kick off to a new trilogy, exactly how you wanted. A rehash of the original?? Guess what, ROTJ was more predictable than any of them, even sitting in that cinema back in the day, I knew exactly what was going to happen, but you know what? I didn't care!I am going to throw it down, if you didn't like this movie, new generation Star Wars isn't for you, time to find a new hobby because here's the reality.....they're not going anywhere! Save yourself the hipster tears and the time typing! Now for my review!Han and Chewie were awesome. Harrison Ford is a legend and he owned that role, I would be lying if I didn't see his death coming, the second he stood on that walk way, I could feel it but it was a classy exit. Rey, LOVE HER, she has a lot of depth and I felt myself warming to her almost immediately. When she was standing there holding that saber to Luke, the hair on my arms were vertical. Finn, at some points I really enjoyed him and at other times I was fighting to like him, but his chemistry with Rey is probably what kept me on side! Poe, I love Poe, I would say he was my favorite character. He's just that bad- ass rebel pilot, simply cool! I love the feel of this new trilogy. It's very homely, has a great sense of mystery, and the excitement of new lore! I probably give the movie a solid 8.9//10. I rated it 10/10 because I think it deserves it again these horribly unfair reviews.BRING ON EPISODE 8!!!!"
" Star Wars returns, for the first real time since the 80's
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"Ignore all the troll-worthy complaints on here. They are from people that have idolized Star Wars so long that the original trilogy have become a 20/10 movies, so when they get a 10/10 they trash on it. Ignore all the people that call it a ""Remake"" of episode 4, it's no more a remake than Episode 6 was.In truth, this is an Amazing film, and the first of 7 Star Wars films Disney is releasing in the next 7 years. (7,8,9 and 4 prequels) and it did a fantastic Job introducing a new Generation to Star Wars. The theater had 20 good guy laughs, and 10 cheers. I can't wait to see the next 6 Films!"
" Star Wars The Force Awakens is 100% Perfection
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"In 2012 after hearing about Disney bought Lucasfilm I was among all other fans that were skeptical and scared of the future of the Star Wars franchise. When the teaser 2 trailer was released in June 2015 and after watching the trailer I was so hyped for this film. So after watching the film, Does Star Wars The Force Awakens delivers?The Film does Deliver!! After watching ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" for the third time in one week I have giving my full verdict a 10/10. The Force Awakens brings a bold new chapter in the saga with both old and new faces with the right amount of new energy and charm. The experience being in the theater while watching this film was simply amazing, the audience was applauding constantly for a reason. Thank you J.J. Abrams."
" Awesome Movie!
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie was excellent and they couldn't have done it better... I'm 27 years old & I've loved Star Wars since the third grade... It was very entertaining and exciting! People that are posting bad reviews are obviously extremely picky and it doesn't seem like anything can please them, but hey that's what opinions are for. They can't make a movie and please everyone but they sure made one that pleased the majority including myself. It felt like I was watching the original Star Wars and the new characters were very likable. The plot was outstanding and my fiancé and I enjoyed every second! I highly recommend anyone that hasn't seen it yet to do so ASAP!"
" A cinematic piece of art that gets underrated by a fan-base that's never satisfied
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"It's truly sad to see a minority of social rejects hating on this wonderful piece of cinematic art, because it almost had me (who's also an old-school Star Wars fan) in tears.What most people want to know is what separates ""The Force Awakens"" from the prequels and it's actually easy to determine:The characters. There were almost no lovable characters in the prequels, but the new actors in 'Force Awakens' are not only doing a great job, but also conquer a place in your heart faster than you would ever think.Especially Daisy Ridley's performance was outstanding, even more so if you consider that she doesn't have much experience regarding big movie appearances. Oscar Isaac and John Boyega are also doing a great job and you just do not get bored of their characters, but of course ... the most brilliant actor besides Daisy Ridley in this movie is definitely Adam Driver. I will not spoil any story details, but I will say this: The Force Awakens is a wonderfully crafted movie with such love for detail that it left me breathless and astounded! Go watch it without any prejudices and you will experience an absolutely fantastic movie and a more than worthy sequel to the old trilogy."
" Absolutely Terrific!
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"Normally I don't do such things as sharing my personal opinion on the particular films online, but this time I'm going to make an exception.I felt like moving back in time to the days when I was a kid who is going to watch the first trilogy for the first time. Yes, the atmosphere, the climate so to speak of this blockbuster was preserved and maintained on the highest level. It has tribute and bow towards elder fans and something fresh and funny to those younger who have just begun their adventure with the Saga.I loved the characters. Han Solo and Chewie just rock. I have never seen them before to have such a great chemistry between them. The new ones, well, they were more than OKAY, especially Rey and Finn, and Poe of course. I also enjoyed the humour, maybe it was a little bit in excess, but I suppose this is something very required in today's cinematography. Special effects? No question about it - TOP NOTCH! Some people might say, 'I've already seen this in the previous episodes', I say 'so what?' In my humble opinion, it's a fresh view and a very interesting approach towards creating something epic that I'm going to long for the next few years. Kudos for Mr J.J. Abrams. I reckon he did his part very well.May the Force Be With You!"
" Great addition to the saga
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie is excellent. It takes 30 years after the Return of the Jedi and people are searching for Luke Skywalker as he had disappeared many years ago. The filmmaking is incredible and the shots are very well done. There are some very interesting and unpredictable twists in the movie.The actors did a great job. You actually felt like these characters were alive and living through these situations. There was even great humor. Now, many people were annoyed with the end. But, I think that the end is great as this will tie directly to the next movie! Perhaps, the only problem I had with this movie is that certain characters like Poe Dameron (played by Oscar Isaac) and R2- D2 weren't in this movie enough. Other than that, it's perfect."
" A fantastic film if you understand context and managed expectations
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie, immensely. It was fantastic. Too many people let hype culture kill their experience or something else.. I didn't. I am a HUGE Star Wars fan, I've spent so much time with Star Wars throughout my life and this movie was a roller-coaster ride of emotions and fun. I am very excited for the upcoming releases, don't let the negative nancies ruin the movie for you. A movie can have flaws and still be fantastic, I don't understand why some people can't grasp that!Their was nostalgia, joy, laughter, sadness, tension, and even remorse. It was a plethora of emotion, with tons of nostalgia to show ""hey we know the prequels were a letdown and we want to do this right."" the setup for the next films had me thinking so deeply about this film, and that's a good thing!When Empire was out the movie ended on a huge cliffhanger, people had questions, were disappointed, and they let the fact of that ruin their experience. This movie does not tell you everything, or spell it out for you, and that's let some people have their experiences ruined. The score was fantastic, the cinematography epic, and the character development was very fun. Watch it now!"
" One of My Favorite Films of ALL TIME
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"First off, to those people who think that this is just a remake of A New Hope, it most certainly isn't. There are similar contrasts to it in parts, but in all honesty, isn't that what we all wanted? Everyone loves the Original Trilogy so much, why should we complain if there are some similarities? That doesn't make any sense to me. These people were just expecting too much in my opinion. They cannot be pleased with anything.I went in with high expectations, and I was blown away. It brought back everything I loved about the original movies. It was fantastic. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is amazing, and I'm excited to see her story continue in Episode VIII. I loved all of the characters actually (Finn, Poe and Kylo Ren were especially great). I thought the action scenes were spectacular. Disney really nailed it with this film.I was never a huge Star Wars fan before this film. I love the first films, but the prequel movies were lackluster at best. This film made me interested in this whole universe. I'm so excited to see what's to come. Kylo Ren and Rey have so much potential to be outstanding characters that'll be remembered forever. I'm incredibly excited for what's to come. 10/10."
" The Force Is Strong With This One. {The negative reviews are wrong}
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,10,"Whoever gave this a negative review clearly lost their minds or just doesn't have much going on upstairs to begin with. This film is exactly what all actual Star Wars fans wanted it to be.Daisy Ridley has a very successful career ahead of her and this film was a great way to kick start that. Oscar Isaac was just the right man for his role and Ford, as usual, was BRILLIANT.JJ did an amazing job in directing this project and the visual effects were as good as they get. If you liked the originals then you're gonna LOVE this.Anything else I can't reveal with giving away something or the other, but I'm gonna bet that if you loved Star Wars than you BETTER watch it or you'll honestly regret it."
" When a work of art is Crushed
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,1,"Let's say it's canned food for children. For the regular Joe who needs something easy to chew. If I had seen the reviews here before watching the film, there would not have been a need to suffer through this joke movie. And I admit that I was about to even become a fan from the start, but then I watched this film and I forced myself to see it and notice how much they destroyed what Star Wars stands for. I clarify that I am not a biased fan. I am only a person who enjoys a story well told. And this copy is not one of them."
" Darth Disney strikes again!
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,4,"This is just another movie which is suffering from ""Fast and Furious"" syndrome. You don't really need a plot or a story of any kind. As long as you have mindless action for no reason and lots of flashy bits then the masses will be entertained like mindless children. I am a life long Star Wars fan and I when I saw this movie, it made me hate the original movies. Hell, even John Williams knew the movie sucked which is reflected in the soundtrack. Everything that the Rebels accomplished in the original trilogy was wasted. It meant absolutely nothing because in J.J. Abrams movie, nothing is different. Nothing has changed. Luke should have rebuilt the Jedi order by now but after one failure he apparently says ""Screw it! I'm done!"" The only reason this garbage pile of a film got so many good ratings on sites like Rotten Tomatoes is due to the fact that Disney hyped it up as much as they could, precisely to do that - to have all the casuals and Pro-Disney fanboy drones sit there drooling while they ""oohed and aahed!"" at all the new & shiny CGI with the SW logo lazily slapped on it. Many casuals and Pro-Disney fanboys like to say, ""B-b-but it got good ratings on RT so, it's a good movie!"" yet they ignore the fact that public opinion of this film has changed from ""all-positive"" to mostly mixed or bad opinions now. They conveniently like to pretend that everyone still feels the same about this film when in reality, most people have woken up from their hype-induced coma and are now seeing this film for what it really is - a poor man's, watered down rehash of 'A New Hope' with scattered bits of the other OT films scattered in there and bits and pieces from the EU novels sprinkled on top to fool all the casuals and fanboys into believing that it was ""new & original"" material.﻿ There are too many ""fans"" for a Star Wars sequel to fail. Fans will blindly defend their brands, and like Stockholm Syndrome will continue defending them when exposed to the truth. Disney knew this going into the deal. And worst of all the ""geeks"" will compulsively buy anything licensed with their brand. So you can either have a new movie without a geek fan base to reap money off, or buy a huge fan base to exploit, and that's what Disney did. They saw The Hunger Games female action chick trend, and used Star Wars as their Hunger Games clone.﻿ Massive plot holes large enough to hide an aircraft carrier, poor script writing, painfully repetitive plot, unfunny comedic moments... The list goes on and on. The difference between me and other people who've said the same thing is I won't be watching Episodes 8, 9,10 where the majority of you will still give Disney your money.﻿ To be honest, I would rather watch a Jar Jar Binks movie directed by George Lucas than to see another J.J.Abrams monstrosity.﻿"
" Great addition to the Star Wars legacy!
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,7,"Star Wars is back and in the best way possible! The new and the old cast are amazing ! I loved every second of it! One of my personal favorite movies of all time! I am very excited for the future of Star Wars.Such a phenomenal movie! The Force Awakens is definitely on my top ten.The force is very strong with this one!They needed to introduce the series. I thought they did a wonderful job with the cast and the effects and the acting was really good. Can't wait to see what they have for episode eight! A great movie with a lot of great surprises! Great acting! Great story! been a huge fan of the Star Wars movies since 1984. Watched them gazillions of times of the years. I never noticed The Force Awakens being a remake of A New Hope. The whole plot is the mystery of Luke Skywalker!!! The people who are complaining are just looking for something to complain about, look cool and be an attention hoar. Star Wars The Force Awakens was wonderful. ---Yidioo"
" Great Film - For Cloners
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,1,"This film is so bad that it's good. I saw it for the first time on New Year's Eve and I spent the whole film wondering where the good parts were. Then I figured 8.1 is payola and IMDb needs mullah. I burst out laughing at the former owner of a spaceship who runs into it in the vastness of the cosmos. Much like the film Ishtar, it's the lame story that really makes this film so bad that it's good. I wish they would release this for free in China so that nation starts to change and sees the true face of American boredom."
" The Force Is Strong With This One
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,10,"As a die-hard Star Wars fan, I felt this movie birthed a new version of Star Wars. It was NOT like the prequels, but then again, it was NOT like the original trilogy- it was a beautiful combination of everything we've seen of Star Wars (with a bit of modern humor). This start to an epic trilogy is well on its way to becoming emotionally gripping, excitingly intense, and elegantly original. Not only does Star Wars: The Force Awakens bring a homecoming to the eager fans who grew up with the original trilogy, it applies to the fans of the prequel trilogy, and also to a new generation of Star Wars fans- this movie applies to everyone who has a lust for great movie-making and classic storytelling innovation. The people who made this new installment have a love for Star Wars as do many, many fans. If you think about it, it IS fans that made this movie. Regardless of who funds the movie (Disney), they did an amazing job of appealing to all ages. I encourage all TRUE Star Wars fans to discard the worthless negative reviews and develop your own opinion. The rants of ""it's just A New Hope again"" or ""What a weak plot line"" are irrelevant in context with what actually happens in the movie."
" Worth the wait!!!
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,10,"For one of the most anticipated movies of all time its quite hard not to get overly excited for the newest edition for the Star Wars universe!With JJ Abrams at the helm of the latest release and with the majority of the original cast returning, there are ridiculously high bars set for this one - and understandably so!JJ does a great job at not going too over the top with graphics, instead opting for realistic props, characters and worlds. Nevertheless it is inevitable that some computer graphics are used - and there a quite a few new tricks that we have never seen in the Star Wars universe that get put into great effect in this release! I must say that whilst some people speculated that this would be a movie purely of lens flares...they have been mistaken. There is and will never be nothing like the opening credits which take us through what has happened over the last 30 years. A hotly debated and anticipated plot revealed, I think that they have done exactly what has been needed. Something new, together with something old - and nothing of something stupid.Having some of the original cast together with some great new talent really refreshed the story and helped to breathe fresh life into the franchise that we all love and care about.As I don't really believe in spoilers, I will simply say this - if you've been eagerly anticipating this movie and can't think of a better thing happening in your life... or if you are a low-mid level star wars fan, or even if you are new to the franchise - I think JJ has done a great job with Star Wars: The Force Awakens as there is something that will appeal to all members of the audience - whether you know any of the original story or not. You will not leave this movie feeling dissatisfied with all of the hype, media and the personal feelings of ultra-excitement that has surrounded it. In fact, at a bare minimum I would say I walked away thinking - now that, was worth the wait, worth the price and worth my time. If you walk away from this movie unsatisfied you have probably tried to look too far into this with plot lines and an already sour taste from the prequels (if you disliked them). If you are not a fan and didn't like all the excitement then I would ask - why did you even go and see the movie? You could have left a seat for somebody who would have appreciated the artwork that has been put together!All in all, this is as a standalone movie - seriously great. As part of the new trilogy - an excellent platform, and as part of the Star Wars Universe - a fresh, new and exciting addition. Well done to JJ Abrams and to all the cast and crew for once again, bringing all of the ideals and emotions you can expect with a real Star Wars movie - plus a couple of new tricks!"
" Excellent Start to New Trilogy
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,10,"This was an unbelievable start to finish movie that was just the beginning of what we are going to see from another great Star Wars trilogy. The pacing of this movie was fantastic all the way through. I was never bored or getting tired of the plot. The characters really make this happen both old and new. Harrison Ford as Han Solo was amazing but the newer cast has a bright future. I liked the development of Rey and Finn and I am super interested to see where they are going next. I also thought that Poe was a great addition as well. If I had to pick a favorite character from this movie alone I would go with Rey. Her story starting as a scavenger on the desert planet of Jakku, relying on her own self to just survive, on to learning her importance in the war to come against the First Order was really well done. I loved how JJ Abrams gave only little hints of Rey having the ability to use the Force. It was an amazing cinematic moment when she took over the saber fight against Kylo Ren and eventually defeated him. The cliffhanger at the end seemed like it was the perfect place to leave off with us finally knowing the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. This is one of my favorite movies I have ever seen in theaters. Spine tingling from start to finish!"
" Disappointing
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,2,"I've never seen the original Star Wars film so I went into watching this with very much an open mind. It ended up being incredibly disappointing although the CGI was cool and reminded me of Independence Day films, the girl, who I imagine is funny in her own right, seemed to have absolutely zero chemistry with anyone else and oddly enough the cleaner trooper character ended up being even more confused than her.That's just my personal observation however. My boyfriend who I watched the movie with told me 'this is sad,' halfway through and also said to me that he had felt ashamed while watching the movie. Seems like it is disappointing for those who have seen the original."
" Star Wars is headed in the right direction again
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,7,"Disney taking the Star Wars reigns out of George Lucas's hands is likely the single best thing that could have happened to the franchise after the controversial prequel mess. With the prequels, Lucas managed to take Star Wars about as far away from what make it work in the first place as was possible, destroying many of the great things about the original trilogy in the process. Effectively, Star Wars was dead...Lucas wouldn't have been able to pull off any future films, even if he would have been inclined to do so.Personally, I was excited when I heard Disney had purchased Lucasfilm and announced plans to make new Star Wars movies. Love em or hate em, if there is one thing Disney knows how to do, it's make successful films. I was even more excited when I heard that Lucas himself had been cut out of the creative loop, the last thing we needed was for him to take us further down the horrible path he chose to take Star Wars with the prequels. After Lucas was dismissed from involvement with the new Star Wars films, I imagine Disney sat down and took a long hard look at what made the original trilogy such a beloved success and the prequels such a criticized mess. Undoubtedly, they didn't want their new franchise to be met with the same overall negativity the prequels received.The formula they came up with was overly simplistic...Star Wars 1977 worked, so let's mirror it. Episode 7 is essentially a reboot of the original movie at its heart. The story is remarkably similar, and each major character from the original is mirrored by a new character. Even the original characters, in addition to being who they were, also seem to at times mirror other original character roles from Star Wars 1977.As simplistic as this is, the bottom line is it worked. Episode 8 looks and ""feels"" like a Star Wars movie, and it's the first one that's been able to pull that off since 1983. The movie has its flaws to be sure, but when put against the prequels, it's superior in almost every aspect. More importantly, it brought back some of the magic to Star Wars that the prequels had effectively snuffed out. No mention of space bugs in your cells that make you strong with the force, no ridiculous prophecy, no distracting fluff and scene bloat, no circus side show of unnecessary characters, dialog and scenes, no uncomfortable and awkward botched romance side story....and no Jar Jar Binks or his equivalent.Instead you have a well paced and clear story. Interesting characters you can connect with on an emotional level. Special effects that dazzle you but don't overwhelm you or take center stage. You have what made Star Wars...well, Star Wars.Taking my young son on it to opening night left me with this thought in my head....that movie experience was, for him, as close as he was going to get to the same experience I had as a child going to see Star Wars in the theater for the first time. And that, in and of itself, made this movie a success in my eyes"
" Star Wars The Force yawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwn!
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,1,"Wow this really is one of the most sleep inducing, yet financial and critically successful movies I have ever seen. Well it's quite obvious Disney knows exactly what they are doing, there targeting the biggest fan base in existence. The Star Wars fans! But it's not only the fans of Star Wars that run out to see this crap in cinemas, it's just about every living person. And do you want to know why? Because Star Wars is a huge event, an unavoidable event!you'll eventually get around to watching even if your not a fan of Star Wars, it's almost like a curse.I'm going to make this review as short as possible because I honestly don't feel like wasting to much time talking about this film.Okay, this movie seems completely pointless it undermines all the struggles the characters of the original trilogy went through. All they're efforts where for absolutely nothing. Because good and evil are stuck in an endless battle, neither will ever truly vanquish the other. There's a great sense of repetition, the events of A New Hope are literally repeating here! This is practically a remake of A New Hope, and a very uninventive remake at at! The main characters are all new; although a couple of oldies make a return beside the new ones. The leading protagonist is a one dimensional mary sue who becomes a jedi master in a matter of hours. secondary protagonist is a rouge storm trooper who is a bumbling idiot that cannot accomplish anything competently. All the characters are unlikable. I went in hoping to see Mark Hamill reprise his role as Luke Stalker unfortunately he only shows up at the end for five seconds and has no dialogue. Alright,that's it, I'am going to wrap this up; bottom line this is a VERY boring movie! Don't give Disney your money because they haven't earned it!"
" Utter rubbish
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,4,"One would have had to live under a rock all their lives to have not seen Star Wars: A New Hope (1977), which begs the question: why are they remaking it here? And, as is almost the case of any remake, it pales in comparison to the original. This episode lacks the pacing, the pathos, the rawness, the acting and the excitement of the first; it is dull, recycled, predictable garbage done half as well. Instead of the producers quite obvious motivation to reintroduce the franchise to a new generation, they've succeeded in alienating the very audience that gave the franchise it's legs. So much fails in this movie: from rehashed plot to abject failure in creativity (such as developing the technologies of the stated future this movie inhabits or creating interesting new characters), I can't help but describe this whole waste of an effort in one word: LAZY. Thoroughly disappointing for any who are a fan of the original and a cookie cutter action film for any new audience."
" An Exciting Return to an Amazing Saga
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,8,"When I go to the movies, I aim to experience one thing: escapism. Even if it's for only two hours, I like to occasionally escape this often unfair world we all live in and lose myself in a fictional adventure. And I think I speak for both the young and the young at heart when I say that Star Wars has brought escapism to audiences all over the globe and for many generations over the past 40 years.I was born in the mid 1990s, so I never had a chance to experience the original Star Wars trilogy on the big screen and this was something that I had a hard time accepting ever since I was a child. I never thought I would be able to see Luke Skywalker, Han Solo or Princess Leia on the big screen ever in my life time. So you can imagine my excitement when I found out that they were making another Star Wars film that was not only inventing an entirely new cast of fresh faced characters, but was also bringing back the cast from the original films, who that of which have not walked on a Star Wars set for over 30 years. So it brings me great delight to be able to tell you that the most recent installment in the franchise did not disappoint.The new characters of the film are all fully developed and come with their own strengths and insecurities. They don't clash with the old cast, but instead melt beautifully with them in every scene. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all do amazingly well. The old cast of course are all stellar too. They slipped back into their respected characters so seamlessly, it feels as though no time has passed at all.I was already familiar with J.J Abrams directing style going into this film. He, once again...does not fail to impress. This film is rife with stunning cinematography. The various locations are as gorgeous as they are aesthetically pleasing. CGI is used in this film, but to my relief it does not overpower the organic and practical effects. The environment in which these characters are staged in feels so authentic and believable, you feel as though you are a part of the journey yourself. It's instantly apparent that this film was made by a man who loves Star Wars just as much as we do.Overall, the film is a triumph. It's a wonderful collaboration of new and old filming techniques that combine beautifully to create the ultimate Star Wars film that everyone can enjoy. It doesn't matter if this is your first experience with the Star Wars saga, or if you've watched all of the films one hundred times over, fans both new and familiar will equally appreciate the love and care that was tirelessly thrown into this dazzling, epic adventure. I anxiously await the next installment."
" Another atrocious science fiction/fantasy film.
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,1,"Surprise, surprise, the ultimate fanboy JJ has plagiarized another popular film. Unfortunately the few changes introduced destroy the integrity of the film while nearly nullifying the achievements of the original trilogy's protagonists.To be fair to JJ one of the main problems probably stems from a certain brunette producer who appears to have insisted that the main protagonist should be an embodiment of female perfection who also just happens to be a brunette. Luke in A New Hope is helped and upstaged by several male characters but for some reason the makers of this film appear to have concluded that people would object if that happened to a female protagonist. All the talents of the original protagonists plus C3PO's facility for translating languages appear to be combined in one character. In short she is too good at too many things, too early. And I have a slight suspicion that one character disappeared for half the film in order to ensure that she was not upstaged.As everything has to be bigger and better in this remake the other protagonists abilities are also sometimes increased to ridiculous levels when facing the antagonists . If the original trilogy was the hero's journey the indications appear to be that our new heroes will take a gentle stroll around the park.Even though this franchise is merely science fantasy the inclusion of the death planet plot element was a particularly egregious affront to science and should probably have been dropped anyway in order to focus on the search for Luke.The whole stormtrooper plot thread seems to be a fundamentally bad idea poorly executed. Stormtroopers should ideally function as faceless cannon fodder for our heroes to overcome without unduly raising concerns in the watching audience as to their fate. If our heroes are killing stormtrooper antagonists by the thousands I do not want them to be simultaneously portrayed as brainwashed innocents. Once this one brainwashed stormtrooper has a mysteriously quick change of allegiance he and everyone else is back to merrily mowing all the rest down again. If it isn't a problem for that one ex stormtrooper it most certainly is for this particular member of the audience. Not that you would be able to tell that he was an ex stormtrooper from his subsequent behaviour, no PTSD in this world, he is too busy playing the part of comic relief.As with other JJ films the fast pace of the film seems to be a deliberate attempt to cover for inconsistencies, plot incoherence, plot holes and a shameless reliance on unbelievable coincidences and deus ex machina. The film is also full of wise arses cracking jokes all the time in a way that severely reduces the tension throughout, a particularly noteworthy offending line of dialogue appearing right at the beginning when one of the protagonists confronts the main antagonist. JJ also fully deploys his mystery box and consequently there are numerous plot elements left unexplained by the end of the film. Whether JJ actually knows the answers to any of these unresolved mysteries is also a mystery.One of the plot elements left unexplained concerns the exact relationship between the three main factions. This clunky setup appears to exist only in order to recreate the power dynamics of the original film where the tiny resistance takes on the might of the Empire. The First Order replaces the Empire while the resistance replaces the rebels. Somehow though the First Order is bigger and better/badder than the galaxy spanning Empire as they have managed to build a bigger and better Death Star/Planet. The third faction is conveniently sidelined in order that the filmmakers can concentrate on copying the plots from the original films. Personally I don't want to see a seventy two year old reduced to reprising the exact same role he played nearly forty years ago, especially when the character development during three films appears to have been reversed for the fourth. As in Indiana Jones he even appears to be wearing the same clothes, maybe the wardrobe department ran out of money after clothing everyone else. Although his presence was the most impactful of the returnees it was still an exercise in empty nostalgia.The shoehorning in of old characters, references and dialogue in order to induce nostalgia in the audience demonstrably effected the overall quality of the film as the script had obviously had to be contorted to breaking point to fit it all in. One of the prime examples being the ridiculous succession of coincidences needed to get the old and new characters together within the same scenes. If it was just new characters bumping into each other in a massive universe that wouldn't be such a problem but the new set bumping into the old set within the confines of this one film makes the universe appear to be smaller than one solar system. JJ then compounds the problem by having characters standing on planets while looking up and watching the destruction of other planets. Did JJ flunk science at school? Is this the revenge of the scientifically illiterate? Answers on a postcard please.And finally, where are all the exciting new worlds and races? Star Trek used to be about boldly going into the unknown but the new films decided to chuck all that rubbish away and concentrate on mindless action, explosions and revenge. Star Wars used to be about new planets, new races, and new adventures. Why bother when you can just get away with rehashing the plots of the original trilogy?"
" far beyond awful
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,1,"A insulting retread of previous star wars movies by a man who's main claim to fame is coming up with appalling TV shows and getting his check before people figure out they are terrible.Another death star,another young person from a desert with no parents who needs training in the force (yet doesn't?) ,Another last ditch battle against overwhelming odds. The new ""actors"" are terrible ,wooden and poorly realised. Daisy Ridley is laughable in her role. Her ""character"" Rey is somehow worse, she excels at absolutely everything some how? mechanic ,star ship piloting, light sabre duelling, using the force??? I started to think that it would rey training Luke when they finally found him.And who the hell goes into hiding and leaves a map all over the galaxy of where he's gone. Nothing about this movie makes sense at all until you factor in who directed it"
" Doesn't Age Well
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,5,"Really enjoyed it on first viewing. The nostalgia of watching an original Star Wars film again, the quick pacing, the intense action -- they all swept me up in excitement. But shortly after leaving the theater, the bad after taste happened. I turned on my brain again and realized that the story was a juvenile attempt at recreating what has already been made. The characters lacked all depth and motivation. The locations were bland. The actions taken were nonsensical, and it felt like JJ Abrams did a connect the dots script to try and make sure he didn't have to deal with the fallout George Lucas had with the prequels; in so doing, he took what could have been an incredibly engaging new episode with a new series of characters, a reorganized galaxy, and a new vibe -- and it turned it into same old same old."
" Too much of an Unnoficial Reboot
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,1,"When the First Star Wars movie came out it was a risky film. I used an orchestra to make a soundtrack, when disco was very popular, supported happy endings, and it went against the realism that was dominating cinema. Then this film goes against the hole idea of Star Wars by just recycling the plot and even the sets' and props' art. There was nothing surprising, as all I had to do was connect who was the New Hope character, and I already knew the major plot elements an hour before they happened."
" A missed opportunity.
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,3,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a missed opportunity and another example of how Hollywood has run out of ideas and stories to tell. Out of all of the stories that you can tell in the star wars universe they chose to tell a story we have already seen. Episodes 4,5,and 6 tell of the epic, galactic struggle of the rebels to overcome the evil empire. They succeed. They make you feel like good has won. There was a good arc and that story is told. The Force Awakens chooses to negate everything that happened in the original trilogy and tell the story of the resistance overcoming the first order. We have seen this. This is nothing new. In a universe full of interesting aliens, cultures, and worlds we are going to get movies full of everything that we have seen already."
" not good enough
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,6,first my English not good so hope from every body to excuse me don't like this movie the acting from the lead actors is bad the action scenes are poor and the jokes not funny from my opinion that isn't good start for the new trilogy the old star wars was the best and then start going from worse to worst hope they stop doing more of this series and left it in peace
" Best after empire
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,10,This film is great! I have seen this movie 5 times and it never got old. In my opinion it got better!! It has a great heroin in rey and villain in Kylo and great action scenes and emotional scenes! Is Star Wars at its best the second best star wars movie out there! Go see it on a big screen with the volume turned all the way up!:)
" The nostalgia is strong with this one
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,7,"""The Force Awakens"" is a movie that unabashedly pampers to fans of the first trilogy and of Star Wars in general with lots of references, winks and I-think-I-have-seen-this-before moments that, depending on your view, will be deeply enjoyed or make you seethe in desperation.Poe, the best pilot of the resistance, gets some info into his droid (a droid that in one of the most head-scratching decisions of the movie just keeps around when it is the most searched thing in the galaxy). The droid runs away but Poe gets captured. Pretty soon he teams up with a stormtrooper with a heart, Finn. The droid, though, has made a new friend in Rey, a scavenger. Will the resistance get the information needed to find Luke Skywalker? Who is this second-rate Darth Vader? How come Rey behaves like a fan around Han Solo and, as supposedly only 30-40 years at most have gone by, all is treated as a myth of 2000 years ago? And those weapons that can destroy all in a solar system... Really?The movie has lots of silly and cheesy moments (and close to ridiculous, as the BB-8 droid conundrum) that could have been avoided with better writing and more care. Some of these moments are just there to advance the plot and bring the next action piece, and are absolutely pointless. There are many moments when the movie seems a fan fiction kind of film, where some people that enjoyed the original like crazy decided to write, direct and act a movie about their childhood most iconic movie. Daisy Ridley's Rey has charisma to share, but Ridley plays her with so much childless glee that we can't but wait for the moment when she will ask for an autograph.The movie starts slowly but picks pace along the way. There will be more than enough twists and action moments to make fans of action happy. The third act, though, is weak and some viewers may check out during it (there are some action scenes we have seen too many times, in particular in this era's blockbusters).On the other hand, the atmosphere, pace and iconic moments more than make up for this. And we kind can't but enjoy all the winky-winky moments, as they are contagious. Seeing Rey meeting Han Solo for the first time replicates how many people will probably feel watching it in front of the screen.""The Force Awakens"" is not a great movie but it is a movie that can be greatly enjoyed if you are a fan of ""Star Wars"" (and if you like your movies with a big spoonful of nostalgia)."
" Whatever Happened To Character Development?
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,1,"Wow. The special effects were standard and the desire for this to be Star Wars was palpable but I swear I can't even remember any of the main character's names. Why? No character development. All I saw was one unbelievable coincidence after another and we didn't get a chance to get to know any of the actors. How could we? They are redoing the original script. James Cameron should have directed this movie. Perhaps he could have saved it from mediocrity and used a new script. What about the history of any of the others? Anyway, the girl hero was a total jackass. The film was predictable. Girl's eventual fiancée is going to sacrifice himself to save them all but girl's daddy can't bear to see his daughter's heart broken so he sneaks off to Ireland and stands on a cliff. Does this sound familiar? Hello...seen it in Armageddon! Two thumbs down!"
" Regurgitation
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,1,"They say imitation is the highest form of flattery. By that estimate Disney and its boy JJ Abrams are paying the highest compliments to George Lucas. However, truth is that the fans should not have to pay for it at the wicket, by wasting their time or via the false advertising that this film is. It was billed as Episode VII, but another orphan, another desert planet, another hidden message, another death star with the same design defect, another troubled father-son relationship and another cute droid on the sand, etc etc."
" weak
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,1,"Warning - Spoiler! The film was really disappointing. Those who have not seen it better wait for the movie to appear on the internet / DVD because it deserves corporations like Disney who have only one interest and to take your money out of your pocket, relying solely on people's nostalgia and special marketing Aggressive.In essence, the film is a copy-paste on A new hope (1977), in all the details and characters of the film: Empire = New Order, Resistance = Alliance, Kylo Ren = Indigo copy after Vader, Emperor = Snoke, Are saved on BB - 8 as on R2D2. The Star of Death appears in the story for 3rd times !!!!!, under a laser cannon this time. dot identical to movies 1 and 3, being destroyed in the same way. The Dad - Son conflict between Han and Kylo Ren is identical to Luke - Vader. The Jaker desert planet looks like Tatooine and so on.The actors are weak, but this is probably due to the scenario that has achieved the performance of not producing a memorable replica. Kylo Ren rather brings a nervous teenager than computed Darth Vader. The only actor that saves the film a little is Harrison Ford, but he is also suddenly killed in a hazy and inexplicable way. Finn and Rey, a scavenger and a sanitation worker manage to resist a laser- sword duel and almost defeat a Jedi without any training. Here ?????I can not understand how, having a budget of $ 200 million, they have not been able to hire a screenwriter to write a story as decent as ORIGINAL. The film does not rise even at the height of episodes 1,2,3 and, like most of today's films, tell them ""modern,"" it's too chaotic, it gives you almost no peace of mind so you can think of the story But it keeps you nonstop in intense action scenes over which I already have. Unfortunately, I am convinced that cinema has become an industry with the sole purpose of taking the money of those who watch and without delivering quality films in return."
" Entertaining enough, but not a solid Star Wars movie
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,4,"The movie itself is not exactly terrible, but their insistence on casting and using Daisy Ridley as the main character makes little sense. With due respect to her, her acting in this piece is sub-par (if you look at any scene with her, she is either holding her mouth open in a shocked O or widening her eyes, and that seems to be the limit of her ability) and her character's development makes little to no sense. This is kind of the common point throughout the movies; things aren't really thought out for any reason and don't connect in any sensical way. Why does a desert scavenger with no vehicles larger than a motorcycle possess incredible starship piloting abilities, to the point where even the famed Han Solo is impressed? Why is someone able to immediately grasp the finer parts of the Force less than a day after hearing about it for the first time? How in the universe did the New Order manage to build their weapon without anybody noticing? Why why why? There are so many loose threads that you can safely enjoy the eye candy, but definitely don't try to get your brain involved or you might leave disappointed."
" OK movie with a rehashed plot
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,4,"The Force Awakens was good the first time I watch it, but it has since become obvious that it is just A New Hope with a new skin. Rey is too overpowered, and can seemingly do anything the plot needs her to do. There were some cool moments, but they don't make up for the lack of originality."
" The Force Awakens Review
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,9,When I went to the Cinema to watch The Force Awakens and I was really excited for the comeback of Star Wars films and the result was great one of if not my favourite film with Daisy Ridley as Rey being good. And return of Han Solo unfortunately he died Which was a shock when I watched it at the Cinema but overall great film With a great plot with the 1st Order and the Resistance I really liked Adam Driver as Kylo Ren. With his awesome mask and he was a different kind of character that you don't tend to see in Star wars at the end I thought the bit with Luke Skywalker and was a let down as I hoped to see more of Luke but it was a very good film to watch.
" I'm getting old...thank God!
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,1,"This is the first review I was ever forced to write.  I nearly forgot the pure and shocking awfulness of this, really  incredible how alcohol can make you forget horrible things that  happened to you.  So I did it, I watched it AGAIN!  After my 6 months stay in Hospital when the blood stopped pouring out  of my eyes and I was able to be in a room with a Television again  without starting to panic and blaming JJ Abrahms for Tschernobyl,  global warming and the fact that my coffee machine broke down I wanted  to read other peoples opinions on this Movie.  And then I saw em....9/10, even 10/10 Reviews, and I started to wonder.  Am I too old to get the magic of this Movie? The Child has grown, the  dream is gone? Well, after 2sec of thinking about it, I say ""no"".  This is just pure garbage still, even looking back at it after months  and let away all the hype that so often leads to disappointment it just  won't hit any boxes. You guys mentioned all the stuff that is bad about  it so I will just mention the part that hurts me the most.  The World shown is simply no world you can dive in. It's just a flat  surface with a Star Wars picture painted on it. No big Fan of Ep 1-3  but they were living, breathing Star Wars Worlds while TFA is just a  dead body. JJA has done the same to Star Trek, (to be honest I quiet  liked it). Take out all the even slightly intellectual contend, fill it  with stereotype non controversial characters, add CGI till there is no  tomorrow and then make a cut every 0.2 seconds to make it feel really  fast paced. Done. But it didn't work at all for Star Wars, mainly cause  Star Wars is based on the story of characters, even if those are  Droids, and a Universe that has a certain vibe to it. A lesson this  movie teaches us is that you cannot create a Vibe if you just cut to  random places that have no relevance whatsoever.  And too bad the characters in this thing are a bit too flat and middle  of the road to be even remembered. A Girl who has obviously super  powers and makes all male Star Wars Characters seam lame instantly as a  main Character, OK, we've all seen this coming after we all hummed the  mocking jay whisper. A black guy who escapes slavery, oh wow,  creativity gone wild. A bad boy that is like a 14yr old son of idiots  acting like an dumb brick, just is plain annoying for no reason and as  menacing as a baby kitten cause that is how the young audience likes it  (Bieber-style). Check! Now give us a bad female character please and we  have the common sense overkill. And there she comes....ha ha, gotcha  It's like they laugh you in the face "".... and we still make money with  this rubbish."" Yeah, funny and please keep my money you'll need it.  DO NOT WATCH IT, RATE IT DOWN, IT'S BAD!"
" A cliché is a cliché is a cliché
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,2,"Look even at times the most welcome change of the times wears out its welcome. As a woman, I was happy that the equality of genders takes shape and grows and becomes more common, but I am starting to think Hollywood has gone too far. First, putting aside the copy/paste script of The Force Awakens, the story line makes no sense. It defies all the logic of the Star Wars universe. This super instant jedi stuff is just not on. But also it is painfully obvious that in order to bow down to the PC trends they have placed a woman at the forefront. I mean Ghostbusters? Mad Max? X-Men? Rogue One? Arrival? so on and so on every film has a female leading actress nowadays... I have no problem with that if the acting was good, the story was good, it made sense, but no.. instead we are treated to bad stories and acting in a forced situation! I mean look at Gravity... No original idea in sight!"
" The weakest Star Wars movie
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,1,"This movie was a sad attempt at making a Star Wars movie. The plot was extremely weak due to it being a sad remake of A New Hope. Such as when the astromech droid gets stranded on the surface of a desert planet and meets the hero, a person in their late teens who then escape the planet with a few new friends on the millennium falcon when the empire attacks. The teen goes on to find a mentor, learns the force, and destroys the Death Star. Also, there are a few plot holes such as when Rey is able to best Kylo Ren despite never even holding a lightsaber before or when Rey knew how to fly the Millennium Falcon despite obviously never learning how to fly it. That being said, I couldn't bear giving this film less than three stars because, despite its flaws, the performances were decent (with the exception of Kylo Ren), the visuals were very well done, and John Williams' musical score was amazing. So, in conclusion, the story is unoriginal and contrived, and there were a few decent parts, but these failed to make up for the weaknesses in the plot."
" Star Wars is back with vengeance no matter what Negatives say.
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,10,"Too many people give this a negative because of ""rehashes of A New Hope"" Well A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back aren't even original to begin with. If we hate The Force Awakens for being unoriginal then use the same logic not only against the original trilogy itself but also Disney classics like THE LION KING. Negatives are also given because apparently Rey is a ""Mary Sue"" People don't seem to pay attention enough to The Original Trilogy if they don't think Luke resembles similar ways. Id like to know more about Rey in The Last Jedi. Her character is EXTREMELY well done. She is incredibly relatable and compassionate. Finn is an amazing character with great enthusiasm and excellent morals. No need for a reason to help someone. Its the right thing to do. Only use violence as Last Resortand Finally.... If I were to be honest.... When you hear ""He was the Best Star Pilot in the Galaxy"" I now think of Poe Dameron! he's a Badass! Reason? He destroyed 10 Tie fighters and 3 stormtroopers in 16 seconds. I love his passion for flying too even if its a bad guy StarFighter! ""I always wanted to one of these things!"" I honestly almost cried at the scene where *SPOILER ALERT* Rey found Luke. Its like finding a best friend of relative you haven't seen for years or decades. I left the theaters with insane chills. I can't decide a favorite character to be honest.... I love them all. Their acting is incredibly believable. While it does have its flaws (What movie doesn't?) I still could NOT have loved it more! (Only thing I didn't like is that Captain Phasma was wasted. Hopefully she is given more in The Last Jedi."
" Boring

It is all copied.In this movie there is no new story it's just that we have the names subbed.A remade film that is too boring to even describe and too long to watch.There is clearly a market for this type of movie since they made a billion. Maybe people just like the Star Wars name and Darth Vader but it's not for me.As a non fan of old I still think they should forget about making another one until they actually have a story."

I know it's a star wars world, and technically none of it is real, but Rey being able to use the force with no training and defeat Kylo Ren from the get-go is just laughable. Pure PC story just used to promote progressive ideals, without a thought for what would accurately happen. Didn't Luke have to train under Obi-wan AND then Yoda to defeat Vader? #imwithher"
" Cheap Parody
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"Well, where do I begin? Star Wars were great, then they started to die with each new episode. Then came this one abomination of desolation of our eyes and brains. What is wrong here - to omit all the mentioned already faults - absolutely wrong and unnecessary amount of silly jokes and vapid humor which leave much to be desired and ruins the solemnity of the film. Are we glad to see old Han Solo and Lea? Nay, they are as old as hills and simply drag by. Chewbacca? Same old geezer. Luke? One second. Not much to persuade us to like this sad, slow, long and unnecessary installment. Then the bad guy comes. Og my, who told him to utter his lines in this unimaginably awful flat bleak whining voice? Is he scary? Never a chance. He is merely a buffoon hidden in a mighty shadow of Lord Darth. And this new bad guy on a throne? Come on, give me a break. All said, we must admit that he sound is crisp, the camera work is serene, the editing is awesome. Well, this is all. Then you watch this and hate this."
" The film that brought an end to an era - Horrible casting, Poor script, No direction.
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,1,"Soul crushing experience really - After generations of children and families growing up with these movies, it seems as though that the time of such practices will be coming to an end, if the quality of movies produced are to be the standard of the force awakens. Id recommend anyone who disagrees with my judgement to watch all the movies in a marathon, in order of release and cross examine each movie. My experience was that I was forced to keep myself awake if anything, so at least they got the title right. The casting - practically all British. Im British myself, born and bred in the heart of London. And I will say (call me prejudice, or what may have you) but British actors lack the emotional capabilities to portray the characters in such films like star wars, our acting schools, nature/nurture, unfortunately do not produce (generally speaking) a good environment for creating a-listing actors for a film such as this. I really wish that Disney's involvement would not of had such an influence. And I only wish George Lucas will return to save the sinking ship."
" Episode 4 with better Visual effects and more cheesy!
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,6,"First of all, I consider myself to be a hugh Star Wars fan. I loved the music and concept since childhood. I did like Episode 1-3 but I agree with most fans that i know of, That the actor to Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Jar Jar Clumpsy Binks reduced its potential. Visually ""The force Awakens looked really great and i loved the concept of combining CGI effects with real craftmanship to give it a more authentic view. However the old characters, especially Harrison Ford (Han Solo) was destroyed completely. It was obvious that they tried to hard to use his aging as humour rather than the character himself. It does copy the story of episode 4 completely and Kylo-Ren was a poor villain in comparison to Vader. It wasn't horrible but not great consider the work and resourses that were put into the making."
" Recommended for viewing
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,8,"In general, I was satisfied with the viewing. The main thing that I liked was how the film was shot. First, the creators as much as possible embodied in it a visual image from old movies. Secondly, there were many actors and favorite characters from the old ""Star Wars"". Thirdly, the film has comical moments that fans of this space saga will certainly appreciate. Well, of course, a lot of shooting both on land and in space. In general, the continuation was possible, as an integral part of previous films. The film is quite dynamic and spectacular. I can not call it the best if compared with the rest of the ""Star Wars"", it can't be called the best.I was pleased with the schedule, and humor added its zest. The only thing that can be attributed to the shortcomings of the film is the absence of a pronounced story line. Of course, the plot is there, but it's some kind of blurry. I recommend watching this movie, but do not expect anything supernatural from him."
" Finally Falling out Of IMDb Top 250
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,1,"This film was in the Top 100 and is going where it belongs: into the dustbin.initially I went into this film with an open mind hoping that it would not be as bad as the reviews here suggest (of course magazine and newspaper reviews were as always glowing so do not count). I definitely wanted this film to surprise me, to make me excited to make me care for the characters and have some investment in the story, but it failed to achieve any of that. What I saw was a two hour mess of a rip off movie supported by mary sues, feminists and of course those abused as children. An unexciting, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on a beloved classic which has some of the poorest dialogue and worst performances I have seen in a while. The computer generated effects were like something out of any Disney picture. The music, in particular had no energy and compared to its original inferior. I honestly can't think of any redeeming qualities that this film has. After waiting so long for a new Star Wars film this comes as a major disappointment. Some things are just best left alone. Disney's accountants and the molested will disagree"
" unconvincing dialogues
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,6,"The main point I want to highlight was the unconvincing dialogues, and a forced feeling of some characters. He forced the bar too hard. I was a bit disappointed. I'm still a big fan, but I hope the next few films are a bit more careful about it. There's no use of so many special effects if the characters' dialogues and emotions are not up to par. And please, stop the cliché of everything in the last second, by an inch, by a triz. This is already extremely predictable. My modest opinion, from a big fan. I hope I have helped."
" Pathetic, empty, brainless, waste of time
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,1,"There is absolutely nothing good or original about this film. Its worse than the prequels. At least Ep. 1 had Darth Maul vs the Jedi, the duel of fates sound track and Otoh Gunga. At least Ep. 2 had Count Dooku, Jango Fett, Kamino, the mass Jedi battle. At least Ep. 3 had Mustafar and Obiwan Vs Anakin and Yoda vs Palpatine. What does TFA have? Its just a blatant carbon copy of things we have already seen and so badly put together that it is laughable. This review is spot on in my opinion so please watch this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g9cJ5WKZeU&t=19s So next we have the last Jedi. Mark Hammil is back. May the force help us.

" Force Awakens Review
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,10,"In my opinion Star Wars Force Awakens is the best movie so far. So I am writing this review to show why the people who think this movie is bad, in my opinion is wrong. First of all this Star Wars has the most humour since I would say: the empire strikes back. There is lots of humour between Rey and Finn, Han and Chewbacca and just BB-8 in general. There is a lot of referring back to characters and things that happened in the original trilogy, but wouldn't 9 out of 10 people be disappointed if some of these people or things weren't in it? Let us not forget that there are way more new characters that have a lot more screen time than the original cast including: Finn, Rey, Poe, Kylo, Phasma, BB-8 and Snoke. The director JJ Abrams could have easily made the whole movie about Luke, Han, Leia and the empire, but he didn't. He made a new movie, with new characters which is very brave in a world at which will throw hate at anything people like or is popular. Now a big problem that people have with this movie is star killer base and that it is too much like the death star. So Kylo Ren is trying to recreate what his grandfather did including the death star. Even when the rebels find out about star killer base they reference the death star. In this movie they also made all main characters very interesting. Rey waits for her family as well as being one with the force. Finn is a rogue stormtrooper, which suddenly makes them more human. Kylo wants to live up to Vader as well as going back to Han and Leia. Han Solo is still interesting in his 4th film as his son is a sith working for the first order. I first saw this movie at the cinema on the 27th December 2015 and I wanted to be the person to that said it would be bad and prove it at the screening. However as well as being my favourite movie it is the movie that proved me so wrong - I was blown away. This movie is called Star Wars the Force Awakens which is fitting as after this film the force awakened in me."

Its obvious that they just wanted to make something and name it Star wars and put Harrison Ford to say ""See ! Its Star wars ! There you see storm troopers ... told you its Star wars !"" The girl heard the words Jedi and force and suddenly she awakened / Oh dear she is a Jedi now ! You must be very Credulous to say ""Okay , she could be a Jedi that fast ... its OK ^_^"" or you have never seen old Star wars movies. Seriously these awful things they make and name them Star wars just ruin what we have in mind from classic Star wars in every aspects except visual effects ."
" So Weak! A Replica of the Original in Nearly every way
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,2,"Not going to write a lengthy review since I'm so late to the party in seeing the movie (yes, I just watched it in 2017). Glad I didn't kill myself to see it when it first came out; though, I felt like I was the only one on the planet who hadn't seen it.Maybe this version works for the young folk who didn't see the originals when they first came out, but for those that did, this movie's plot is nearly identical to the original so I'm blown away by how positive the reviews are for this. Its not terrible, but holly crap, there is nothing original in the story! I don't really understand the purpose other than cashing in on all the Star Wars geeks that will blindly kneel to the almighty Star Wars universe (just as they do with their expensive new Apple devices that are behind the times).Anyway, nuff said. Movie was weak and disappointing. This is coming from a dude who saw all 3 original movies in the theater. Slowing gone down hill since. Not sure I'll waste my time with Rogue One."
" Gravely Disappointed
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,1,"Star wars has been demeaned, and its heart breaking. It's basically the old story lines told over again but its rushed and cheap and just plain disrespectful to the fans. If you have any respect for your love of star wars do not watch. Keep and protect whatever beautiful memories and nostalgic feelings you have now because its all downhill from here. Horrible acting, no creativity, rushing through story lines they have no business rushing through, or going over."
" I own all stars wars movies except this one. This one does not exist to me
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,4,I own all the movies including the new Rogue One. However with episode 7 I got it as an unwanted gift and returned it the next day. I have three different versions of the original series the prequels on bluray and bought rogue one on release day. I own all the clone wars and Rebels. I got rid of this movie as soon as I possibly could. There is nothing good about this.
" This movie consists of nothing more than easily digested, brainless and derivative scripting designed for the casual viewer.
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,5,"It seems obvious to me that Disney wants to distance themselves from the franchise George Lucas created as they have done their best to create a brand new, albeit similar universe which deviates significantly from the previously established star wars universe.Unfortunately, after watching I don't hold a new hope for Episode 8 which from this experience will likely become another remake in disguise. Their obvious intention to recreate the old movies, amazingly almost scene for scene, inside their own 'new' star wars universe just doesn't sit well with me.I cannot see how anyone justifies a higher rating than 5 or 6 (if rating it as a star wars movie) do these higher raters realise they have been lied to about this being a 'new' film? Do any of them realise the previous movies were literally torn apart to make this monstrosity called 'Episode 7'? Do any of the higher raters care at all? How can so many people dismiss the fact this movie was literally made to destroy the previously established lore for Disneys own reasons and be OK with that??In summary this 'new' star wars is nothing more than a blatant re imagining on the original three movies (IV,V & VI) with Disney doing their best to rewrite the franchise using lazy and almost identical plots to those original movies. For these reason I give this a deserving 5/10 rating, an average rating for a average film."
" Very good compared to the past
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,8,The force awakens was a very enjoyable movie for the average star wars fan. New viewers of the series will also probably enjoy the movie. The movie critics if the world that look for something new and innovating will hate this movie. This movie is a close replica of the first star wars movie in a couple ways. If you were to summarize The Force Awakens and A New Hope at the same time you would recognize how similar they are. Now for star wars fans that isn't the worst thing in the world because it is refreshing to see new faces and things from the old movies that all is star wars fans love. The only disappointing result of this movie is the company making the best and most complex character of the movie a big cry baby everywhere you see him. Even in the Disney World park Kylo Ren throws fits. It's truly disappointing to see the downplay of such an interesting character.
" The Worst of the Very Worst: Should be Forbidden
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,1,"In my short life I have seen quite a whole lot of bad movies. In this category, this one beats the rest by a mile. This movie is a serious disgrace to the Star Wars franchise. All that work put into building a legendary movie series and with just one 'remake' (that's what it is, it's definitely not a sequel) they completely destroy all credibility.For me personally, they didn't just destroy all Star Wars' credibility but the Oscar's too. The Oscars have been a symbol of the best movies in the world for a long time now and I have always looked forward to see the winners every year but not anymore. Star Wars: The Force Awakens winning an Oscar is even a bigger joke than for example American Pie winning one.This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. You will not find a more predictable story line anywhere and the actors are performing incredibly amateuristic to say the least (Yes, Harrison Ford is no exception). It's like they held auditions somewhere in the smallest, saddest town they could find and just randomly picked a few immature boys and girls with pretty faces just to give them the pleasure of being able to say to their friends they made a debut on 'the big screen'. If you liked the past Star Wars movies, I beg you not to watch this one but just as I'm unable to forbid you, otherwise I most certainly would."
" Leaves A Lot To Be Desired
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,1,"A prestigious series has fallen under the talon of remake specialists (Disney - Beauty And The Beast, Power Rangers, Cinderella...) and there is as much originality here as Donald Trump lying that he is not a liar.

Do yourselves a favor and watch the original 70s film.This is really a comment that I would normally post on the message boards, but somebody got rid of them :("
" So bad I had to create a review account
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,2,"This film is so silly I felt forced to write a review. copied from the classic with no shame, copied, full of clichés, poor acting (this is big), poor storytelling, no script writing (it just copied the originals without announcing it)- it's got it all. If you want to see lots of CGI modelled after someone else's ideas and hear lots of pointless bass noises, then this is the movie for you. It was so poor, I fell embarrassed. I would have hit stop, but the tiredness from my sleep compelled me to just sit there. The only redeeming features are: won't pay for any more of this series the CGI (in parts) is great and the story is connected to the Star Wars name. Nonetheless, this film is a waste of time and money (unless you don't care for originality or are younger than 11 mentally and don't know Star Wars)."
" Not terrible, not great either.
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,6,"Basically a reboot and utilising bargain basement versions of characters from the classic trilogy. Not terrible but also not great. Snoke is rubbish as is star killer Base.Rey starts well and rapidly becomes preposterous. One minute the force and the Jedi are a myth, then she's pulling mind tricks like a pro. It's fun while it lasts but the story is just stupid."
" It sucked.
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,1,"It sucked as a movie, and compared to Rogue One, it was absolutely pathetic. Rogue One was well done and a good movie even if you don't like Star Wars. After having seen Rogue One again this weekend, Force Awakens ##### me off as bad as those Star Wars episodes 1-3 did a few years ago. Same territory.Force Awakens was just pathetic. Bad acting, complete copy of the 1977 film almost to the point of making you wonder if it was a joke that got out of control.JJ Abrams made a great Star Trek film, the first one at least, and made LOST awesome for a few years but then flopped really bad at the end of that series and really not great on the remaining Star Trek movies. Force Awakens is 10 times worse. His work is not good. He's M. Night Shyamalan 2.0."
" Yet another Abrams disaster
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,1,"If I had known this movie would just be a fan-service mash-up of the Original Trilogy (minus a compelling story-line), I would have saved myself the money and time I wasted going to see this turkey. The characterization was weak even for Disney; the ""Mary Sue"" character (Rey) had nowhere to go in terms of story, because she was already perfect. There was, at least in my opinion, no reason to care about any of the new characters, and while it was nice to see the original cast members again, there wasn't really very much for them to do. Of course, I probably should have known better, what with J.J. Abrams directing; like his ""reboot"" of Star Trek in 2009, I'm just going to have to consider Episode VII as something that happened a long time ago in a galaxy far away in some alternate universe that has no bearing on the universe of the first six Star Wars films. And now that I've seen what Disney can do with the franchise, you can bet that I won't be seeing Episodes VIII and IX (or any Episodes beyond the Sequel Trilogy)."

It is a copy of the original. This movie was just sad, like being euphoric due to abysmal acting and a bad script - in this case cloned script. This is my initial review and I felt obliged to rate this because there is no way in justifying the current 80% grade. I feel like there must have been a lot of paid reviewers vote prior/without watching the movie to influence the vote. Save your time, there are plenty of other movies worth watching out now."
" After Many Years of Waiting, This is the Star Wars Film you are Looking For...
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,8,"Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is directed by former Star Trek director J.J. Abrams and focuses around a scavenger (Daisy Ridley), a runaway stormtrooper (John Boyega) and the former war hero Han Solo (Harrison Ford) as they search for the key to destroying the newly-formed First Order, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Overall, I am a huge Star Wars fan who knows quite a thing or two about the franchise (not to brag). When I first found out about this film being under production, I was very excited, yet nervous as Star Wars films have had their bad days. Now, after two years of reflecting on the film, I think I am finally ready to get my opinion out there.Pros: When watching this movie for the first time, I noticed that the cinematography in this was very different from the Prequel Trilogy. It gave you this feeling that every second screamed adventure and did not feel so contained and dull like the Prequel Trilogy. For example, this movie contains a lot of quick pan overs that were frequently used during the more exciting scenes. Yet, this movie knows when to stop using those when, for example, there is character development going on, which is another huge plus in this movie. The chemistry between all of these characters is great and, as a viewer, I did not dislike any character in the movie and enjoyed everyone in it. I especially enjoyed the main villain in this movie, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), whomst I feel is very underrated as a villain in this universe. The character himself is not your tipical Star Wars villain like Darth Vader or Darth Revan, but is torn between doing good or being a servant to Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). Otherwise, I enjoyed every single character, whether it be Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, Max Kanata or Kylo Ren, who is a fresh breath of air for Star Wars antagonists themselves.Cons: This film, although an enjoyable one, does suffer from a few plot flaws. Many people have been bashing the movie's plot for being a total rehash of the original Star Wars. Although the plot was somewhat of a rehash, it wasn't a bust for me at all, although I felt that it did take it to far at points. The prime example of this is Starkiller Base. This is probably one of the laziest things I have seen in a Star Wars film as it feels like a plot point that doesn't quite fit into the story itself, which focuses around finding Luke Skywalker. In other words, it does not have that feeling of importance that the Death Star had in the original Star Wars as that was a huge focus for that plot. Overall, Starkiller Base is just another lazy attempt at making yet another super weapon and is of little significance to the story. Although people may have found other cons to this movie, I personally did not find anything really worth pointing out in this review that is terrible. I think everything else was well done in this movie, whether it be the CGI or the battles, and it surely did entertain me as a whole.Final Verdict: Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens definitely brought audiences back to a galaxy far, far away in a safe, yet great way that was very much faithful to the original Star Wars trilogy. I have to say that J.J Abrams did a great job with this movie and, although making some mistakes like Starkiller Base, was solid overall and I do suggest seeing it before Star Wars Episod VIII: The Last Jedi comes out later this year."

" Not bad movie, But feels desperate for no sequels
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,5,"Im not the biggest starwars fan, but i honestly found this not very starwars. It seemed so desperate to end the story, that it felt like 5 starwars movies, but with only the climax of each movie in it. The main character is a young girl whos parents have left her at a garbage planet, and all of a sudden becomes a jedi. it takes no training, no work, no effort. She just becomes a jedi. Doesn't that seem kinda dull to you? any other jedi had to train for years on edge just do use the force, and learn how to fight with lightsabers. She just closed her eyes, and beat Kylo Ren who was abducted as a child to become the ultimate Jedi, and was trained to do nothing else since. They also destroy the death star, and find the last jedi in the universe. Luke Skywalker didn't use the force a single time in his first appearance, except for that one time he shot a missile, which was just to prove he was starting to get the force. Now this chick makes Obi Wan-Kenobi that defeated anniken look like jarjar binks. She doesn't have to learn to use the force, or try, but LITERALLY just closes her eayes and lets the universe fight for her. when a character starts off to strong for challenge, we don't get attached, we don't get to see them grow, they just have a few epic fight scenes. that's not enough to be one of the greatest starwars movies of all time. this thing ranks up to castle in the sky, one of my all time favorites, and i haven't seen it tell i was 4, but remember the whole plot and all the main characters easily. i think this was OK"
" Boring

Also, I am not a teenager so I didn't appreciate all these jokes and oneliners Don't know maybe now that I have full breasts lol I am too old for this stuff. By the way do all girls have to be like so manly nowadays? Nothing wrong with being pretty and cool and flaunting it like a girl once in a while.

Snoke (Kylo Rens master) looks like he is 100 years. Where was he during the return of the Jedi? Also how did the fallen Empire manage to be rebuilt as the First Order within that short time? Do they make these Death Stars in lightspeed? The movie is ridden with so many flaws and errors it's a mockery of everything done by Lucas. It also has so many similarities with A new Hope that it's basically the same movie redone. I found this whole movie to be a huge disappointment, perhaps the biggest in movie history. The CGI is OK but for the budget they had it's not impressive. I hope that people convey to Disney how much they messed up the Star Wars universe. It's a turkey of a movie. Perhaps the biggest ever."

Still, average rating on that same IMDb is 8,1. Conclusion - movie is not at all that bad as they wanna show it. Haters are minority, but all haters have unbearable urge to bash everything they lay their eyes on, while the rest of us who liked the movie and who are in huge majority, mostly do not care to write reviews. To be completely honest, most of their arguments against this movie are hard as a rock, it's all facts, but the final result is not bad movie at all. Haters claim this is is plagiarism of original trilogy. True, movie has one of the most appalling lack of originality I have ever seen, but I prefer to consider it reboot of the original trilogy rather than plagiarism. Yes, they made it to get some more money on old fame and, yes, everything in it we saw before, but still it is nicely done and very entertaining movie. Maybe I fell on targeted nostalgia they cunningly used, but I really really enjoyed this show from the beginning to the very end. I simply loved it.7,5/10"

",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"The fate of a foot soldier, an ageing pirate (and his loyal sidekick), a young girl, a star pilot and the leader of an enemy army, all collide and intertwine in this highly anticipated return of the Star Wars series.It was with apprehension that I approached The Force Awakens. Having invested a great deal of expectation and anticipation into the prequels during my formative adult years, I approached TFA with a sense of withdrawal. This stemmed from the fear I have that any amount of hype would eventually just leave me in another state of devastation and possible resignation to the knowledge that our heroes (George Lucas, I'm looking at you) will always remain all too human, a state which I have never quite recovered from. Well TFA has somehow restored my faith in movie-making, and possibly in life itself, from the first moment when the words ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" appeared, to the second when the ubiquitous blue credits started rolling at the end. For the whole duration I was taken back to my youth, more specifically, the heady days of the early nineties, not to a time when I yearned for adventure and sought mystical powers to defeat my enemies, but to a time when all that I demanded from certain sci-fi adventure movies was that they were as good as Star Wars.TFA is most certainly a movie that can stand quite proudly amongst the original trilogy. J.J Abrams vision shows a director who has a deft eye for the spectacular whilst equally comfortable paying homage to his predecessors. A good clue to this movies retro roots is in the title itself, ""The Force Awakens"", the director J.J Abrams definitely reclaims the power and mysticism of 'the force'. In the prequels ""the force"" became a throwaway trope, everybody had the force in the prequels and it was used so flagrantly that we forgot it's true intangible qualities. In TFA, as the name suggests 'the force' is used sparingly, but to great effect (there was one particular scene where I had to fight the urge to applaud in the cinema). J.J Abrams clearly understands the text that he has be given along with it's wider fandom, and rather than shrink, he has rose to the occasion and brought us something great, spectacular and touching epochal.In terms of story telling, the characters of Rey and Finn carry the lions share of the plot, whilst characters such as Han Solo, Chewbacca and Princess Leia return to add some much appreciated gravitas to proceedings. Also there should be a mention for the actor Adam Driver playing the latest antagonist Kylo Renn. Driver plays this role well and is convincing in his troubled persona, appearing evil yet at the same time angst ridden. In previous instalments both Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader carried this duality inside of them, but Kylo Renn truly embodies this fear (and rage) as an integral part of his character. Through his portrayal of Kylo Renn, Driver elevates what could have so easily been a poor mans Darth Vader to a character that is fresh and suitably imperious.Now to address some of the criticisms directed at the movie. Some may argue that rather than paying homage TFA is in effect a reboot/re-telling of the original trilogy, twists and turn and all, WITH the inclusion of a Death Star and a masked villain who has more than a passing resemblance to Darth Vader. You could even go further and say that whole characters along with their personality traits have been cut and pasted from the original trilogy and plonked square onto a whole host of characters in TFA. Whilst this is undeniable and some might argue all too obvious, the only defence that I can give to this is that TFA is the first of a new trilogy. The faint whiff of a movie making process that is hedging it's bets on how to develop it's character, and what direction to take it in, has not quite come about fully formed.To take it to another discussion I think Hollywood has learnt that introducing new characters to a well known and beloved movie series (I hate the term franchise) can be a precarious one, Jar Jar Binks being the go to model of new characters that did not quite resonate with an audience. So it is very likely that the writers erred on the side of caution and made certain characters from TFA a composite of what was great about previous characters in the original/prequels. Is it noticeable, yes, is it enough to distract and cause this audience member to cry foul, no.Ultimately, once all the analysis has been done, The Force Awaken succeeds in reinvigorating and restoring the lustre of the original trilogy. A lustre that had been besmirched by the god awful George Lucas prequels. It has been noted by many commentators that the prequel trilogy was too explanatory, telling the story in a way which was both lacking in subtlety, yet somehow at the same time convoluted and bogged down in some civil war/trade politics that nobody could quite explain nor care for. The Force Awakens dispenses with all the faux political subtexts that effectively ruined the prequels and takes the story back to the heart of the original trilogy. That heart being the story of an everyday young hero longing for adventure, who is then taken on a fantastical journey and on the way meet an unlikely crew of bandits and mis-fit companions. Eventually said hero discovers that their life not only has a higher purpose, but that greatness is, and always has been inherent within them. It's a story as old as story telling itself, but when done right, it hits the mark every time."
" Best star wars since Empire
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Seems that everyone either loves or hates this movie. While some people think it's the best star wars, others think it's the worst. I'm in the middle. It's a great film, but far from the best star wars. Better than the prequels, and I even thought it was better than ROTJ. So for me it's the 3rd best star wars film, but it's still a really well made film. It's acted and wrote well, which Rouge one is not. The series needed this refresh, which is why I am mostly okay with the rehashed story. Still, the characters are well written and acted, and the visual effects are stunning"
" Time has not healed this wound
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,1,It's been a over a year since I saw this movie and I'm still sad that they destroyed this franchise. The visuals were great. The beginning was good. Beyond that JJ created a bunch of character that I don't care about and I'm not interested to see where this story goes. What kills me is reading forums before this movie came out of possible plot lines and stories from fans that sounded ridiculously awesome. It actually hurts my soul know that Disney has turned Star Wars into galactic garbage.Just watched the sequels a couple of nights ago and they aren't nearly as bad as I remembered. If you just dubbed out Jar Jar I would say they were pretty good and great relative to TFA.
" Make Sure You See It A Second Time...Trust Me
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"Seeing a new Star Wars movie is a big deal. It should be filled with great special effects, a compelling story, and intriguing characters. ""The Force Awakens"" hits all of those marks, providing a very entertaining viewing experience. However, as Old Biff might say in Back To The Future 2: ""There's something very familiar about all of this"".For a basic plot summary, ""The Force Awakens"" introduces a number of new characters to the Star Wars universe and has multiple plot threads interacting with each other simultaneously. It is set roughly 30 years after the events of ""Return of the Jedi"". I want to talk about the characters more specifically, so suffice it to say that the main plot lines center on these two ideas: -Springing from the ruins of the Galactic Empire, the New Order is consolidating power once again in a era where the Jedi are not a force to be reckoned with. In this film, the New Order is nearing completion of a solar-powered weapon that take take out multiple planets in a single burst. On the brunt end of that force? The Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), a similar offshoot of the Rebel Alliance doing everything in their power to avoid the First Order getting any stronger. -While the battles wage on in the air, a more personal quest is undertaken by many to find the map to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a Jedi who has not been heard from in quite some time.There are many things that ""Force Awakens"" does right. I could write pages and pages of character description and highlights, but for the sake of brevity and spoilers, I'll just hit the highlights: -It ""feels like a Star Wars movie"" in its epic scale. I was entertained pretty much from beginning to end. -It introduces new characters expertly. Solitary orphan Rey (Daisy Ridley), storm-trooper- turned-Resistance-sympathizer Finn (John Boyega), and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) are all intriguing and immediately have a sense of gravitas about them. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is also introduced, but he plays a much smaller role (with the potential to grow). The same can be said for the mysterious Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) -The ""winks and nods"" to the IV-VI trilogy are all over the place. From the return of Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) aboard the Millennium Falcon, to some old droid friends, and even a lightsaber steeped in mythological significance, this film isn't shy in the least about hearkening back to the ""good old days"" of the original trilogy.No doubt about it, this is a very entertaining, dramatic, and visually appealing Star Wars film.Here's the problem, though, and the reason I can't give it the full star complement: To me, at least, it seemed a bit too derivative of ""A New Hope"" in terms of plot. ""Large evil force builds unstoppable weapon that can only be defeated by a band of X-Wings by targeting a single location"". Where have we heard that before? Even Rey being introduced out in the desert is very reminiscent of Luke's original family at the beginning of Episode IV. For a movie that does so well about developing new characters, re-introducing old ones, and continuing the important story lines, one has to wonder why certain parts are so derivative of what came before.If I had to guess, I would say that hearkening so heavily back to the original trilogy was a way of establishing that this one was going to distance itself as far as possible from the controversial prequels. I find the prequels to have value, but many (most?) Star Wars fans don't share that point of view. So, perhaps this return to the conventions of the original trilogy is the greatest possible scenario for many fans. I was just a bit disappointed that a mind as creative as JJ Abrams' is couldn't think of something a little more original to represent the New Order/Resistance conflict.Of course, there is also very much a sense of ""delayed gratification"" aspect of this film, as it is primarily setup. Many new ideas are thrown around and very few of them are expounded upon. There is a tantalizing teaser of a final scene that hopefully sets up a dynamite Episode VIII, but as I sit right now there are many unanswered questions. That's probably a good thing for the first third of a trilogy, but it just pushes ""final judgment"" out further to see if this setup will really payoff. I hope so.Overall, ""The Force Awakens"" was a very entertaining movie that will enthrall Star Wars diehards and make millions of new, young fans too. I had fun watching it. I just can't give it that ""classic"" stamp of approval because of that lingering sensation that so many plot devices were taken from ""A New Hope"". Perhaps a second viewing will change my perspective (update: it did...for the better!)."
" 'Help me finish, what you started'
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,8,"I don't think I've ever cried out of sheer happiness. It's an incredible feeling, and one I had figured I would never feel because of my relatively pessimistic attitude on most things. The Force Awakens achieved this, not through emotional manipulation or cinematic perfection, but by simply inducing a powerful sense of nostalgia inside me. It's not a perfect film by any means. I was disappointed they did not stray from the whole idea of a planet destroyer once again. The callbacks to the originals, while welcome, were perhaps a bit too frequent and intrusive to the flow of dialogue. The humor was a key player, for better or for worse, and while being hilarious may have limited some of the tension in the narrative. Captain Phasma is under-utilized, I'm skeptical of a certain CGI-rendered villain and the Millennium Falcon takes far too much damage.But flaws have never been easier to overlook. By far the most exciting aspect of this new trilogy is the incredible characters Abrams and those portraying them managed to create. Rey is remarkable, brought to life by the incredible Daisy Ridley and instantly my number two movie crush. She's so deceivingly independent and capable that it's easy to miss that she is one of the finest female characters in a major film in years. John Boyega's Finn is hilarious and unique, instantly accessible and delightfully enthusiastic to just be in a Star Wars film. Po is suave, BB-8 adorable and the old cast fits right back into there roles from decades ago.Kylo Ren, Star Wars' latest villain, is a great contradiction to the Sith of the past. He's unhinged and untrained, sort of akin to Anakin Skywalker but without the forces of light to sway him. He's not in control of himself, he doesn't recognize the extent or limitations of his power, and Domnhall Gleeson's political leader is a rival power to him. He's fallible and vulnerable, mysterious in some respects but menacing in his instability. Much like Vader, he takes on a different persona when unmasked, adding a really compelling layer to the previously unsympathetic evil in Star Wars films.What peaks here, and really shines, is Harrison Ford. From the first few minutes we're exposed to Han Solo, we can tell that Ford has taken great care into the role. This isn't Harrison snoozing for a paycheck like in his last 30 movies, no, instead this is a Han Solo who has aged 30 years since the last time we saw him and has truly seen some horrible stuff go down. He's gruff, he's lovable, he makes quips and remarks; he truly is Han Solo. Perhaps that's why he and Carrie Fisher almost share the best scene in the movie. Both times I have seen this, I teared up. John Williams gently brings back the love theme from Empire Strikes Back and instead of a grand romance we get a gentle nod from one character to another, understanding that they weren't meant to be together forever, but they still care for each other, and you can almost feel Han wanting to say ""I love you"" again. They hug, we cry, and also prior we get an amazing sequence with Poe and Finn which is so visually dynamic that if you watch it in 3D you get a bit nauseous in a good way. From the second Han steps out onto that bridge, we know Han is going to die. I began to tear up as he screamed at his son, ""BEN!"". The scene is emotionally perfect, as everything goes silent but the footsteps of Han and the voice of Kylo. The light of the dying sun reflects the state of Kylo's mind, as Han pleads with his son to come home. For a brief moment, and the hope of a fool (me), it looks like all might be well. But then there's that flash of red and the gentle touch of a face, and in one brief moment a hero from my childhood is gone. I cried, of course, but the real icing on the cake is the anger you feel and the satisfaction you get when Chewbacca blasts one into Kylo's side and tears that place apart.I can't sing the praises of JJ Abrams enough. While his vision is certainly unique to Lucas', it retains the mythical approach to storytelling and world-building that made his works great. Like A New Hope he recognizes the idea that we all appreciate a story that recalls our childhoods, told through unassuming nobodies evolving into figures of heroism. Modern effects are utilized to inject life into the franchise, but he manages to recall the glory of Lucas' boundless imagination in the best way.I'll remember that Thursday night as some of the best hours I've ever had in the cinema. It was an out-of-body experience, an ethereal and overwhelming barrage of emotion and happiness unlike anything I have felt before. This is the simple joy of being a film fan. The ability to become so engrossed, so involved and so in love with something you know is not real, and to allow it to become fundamental to who you have become. It's a world fully of mystery, wonder, adventure, action and humor, rife with heroism and a wonderfully inadvertent celebration of life itself. Star Wars is surely one of the most important players in my life, and I look forward to being able to grow up once again in the universe I have loved for so long."
" A franchise extended, by removing its charm.
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"I as a 63 year old big kid, loved Star Wars. What made the first 6 films enjoyable, were the wide ranging array of Alien like creatures. Somehow the makers of this film decided to omit all of them bar one. Why on earth remove the charm of these past films, and include a poor effort of a Darth Vader . The script was a major disappointment, and the inclusion of the primary original characters failed to inspire. The film needed a good story teller, with the humour of past works included. What a let down this was, and i am wary of the next instalment. Up dated special effects, were not enough to keep me happy."
" Cut out with all the stupid jokes and one liners Disney
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,2,"This is Star Wars not Mickey Mouse Disney's so-called Star Wars is easily one of the worst films ever made, that some critics fell for it or got paid for it, just shows how bad today's professional critics have become. There is no doubt all the 9 to 16 year old virgin fan boys are going to attack all of us, that have seen through this psycho babble nonsense. But those guys are just pretending to like this because they want to appear hip to Star Wars to get a girl or their parents are accountants. At no time to you feel anything for any characters maybe because they forced a girl as a leading character and of course she is the jedi of all jedi, etc.The film maker in charge of this deserves the same fate as George W Bush: anonymity and being shunned by the rest of humanity for his criminality and bad taste."
" Why don't you just burn your cash at home?? It is faster and you even save money on gas money not driving to the cinema
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,1,"As someone who loves the original 70s original to this day, I was of course skeptical of the reboot. I am happy to be right and then some.I hated this movie computer generated movie (based on an accounting program running of course), I saw it in January last year, which compounded the feelings of deja vu mixed with something old and rancid. The gender role reversal was clichéd, the jokes were unfunny and way too many for the most part, with R2D2 stealing the show in the minute he is on the screen.The dumb guys in every film are also a redundant touch by now, we now always see that, and it was so clichéd to see the same old turn up here again.So, sorry woman-babies, sorry that you need a movie to make you secure in your gender, because real women are not scared of strong and smart men."
" The Force is Strong With this One
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,9,"This franchise does not need to be defended by anyone. It exists as a juggernaut of franchises and cannot and will not be stopped. The Force Awakens is a spectacular entry in the Star Wars franchise. I take issue with anyone who finds nothing in this entry to enjoy. It literally is a joy to watch from beginning to end. It brings back just about every feeling you could want in a sequel of this nature. The original cast members that return are quite simply Star Wars royalty and all do their jobs excellently. Ford steals the movie as Solo in a performance that will be legendary. The new cast's in Ridley, Boyega, Gleeson, Driver and Isaac are all home runs and they did a great job of laying the ground work for future episodes. The force is strong again... and Star Wars is back in every way possible. Great job by all involved."

" Trying to keep a well ended story going.
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,5,"After letting it sit in my mind for a while, The Force Awakens seems to get worse and worse. I enjoyed the movie the first time, but the more I think of the story, characters, and plot devices, the more bad it becomes. In my opinion, Return of the Jedi wrapped up the Star Wars saga perfectly, and to be brutally honest, The Force Awakens feels like just another way for Disney to make money by bringing the legendary franchise back. The new antagonists don't seems to have any meaningful motivation and follow the original villains WAY to closely, with a pure evil character overseeing the whole plan, and a younger villain struggling between the light and dark side. And just like before, there is a resistance fighting against a bigger empire trying to take over the galaxy. For the most part the movie felt like an unoriginal cash grab trying to start another saga from the ashes of an old franchise."
" Ignore the trolls this reboot sucks
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,1,"and ignore this movie. Terrible. I went into this film with an open mind hoping that it would not be as commercial as the reviews suggest. It was. I really wanted this film to rock me, to make me worried to make me care for the freedom fighters defending themselves against the resurrected empire and have some class in the story, but it failed to achieve any of that by a mile. What I watched was a two-hour mess of a film written, produced and directed by whores of accounting. An cloned, poorly filmed, poorly edited, sad cash-in on a beloved science fiction classic is now enslaved to Disney the pushers of clichéd domesticated and predictable cartoons with as much risk and creativity as the fiftieth version of Beauty And The Beast. Horrible insult to viewers and Star Wars from the producers and director. Disney you are busted."
" Unbelievably Boring
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,1,"This movie is so awful that i will not waste too much time or electricity on this review. The characters are awful and there are so many stupid plot holes which only a low IQ audience can withstand without developing a brain tumor mid-movie. It was for this reason i could not bear to finish the entire movie, after forwarding a lot of bits in the first 40 min, at the 1 hour mark, me and my wife simply turned off the TV and went out to the garden go detoxify. The entire time we were genuinely cursing at the movie.I cannot in the right conscience recommend this to anyone. If you must watch it, do not pay money for it. Im sure there are plenty of people who are willing to give away their copies of this if you asked."
" An energetic space adventure
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,9,"When I came out of the theater after watching 'The Force Awakens' I never thought that I would have to defend it against haters. It seemed that the movie had taken its audience by storm: it was lauded as a triumphant return to form for the Star Wars franchise after lackluster prequel films. Now, a year later, people seem to have turned against it. It copied Episode IV, they say, it is manipulative and calculated, it is derivative to the point of repeating key plot points and characters.It is true that there is a lot of nostalgia pandering in the movie, a flaw that also plagued 'Jurassic World' which came out the same year, but that pandering hardly ruined my enjoyment of either movie. 'The Force Awakens' is energetic and adventurous. It does things by the book, but it does them right. There are the lovable underdog heroes, there is the menacing villain and the sinister mentor behind him, there are the allegories of fascism and there is the sense of wonder that hints at such a large world that we are glimpsing at. There is urgency and there are high stakes, there is trust and betrayal, old heroes and new. There are lightsabers and massive superweapons, space magic and robot comic reliefs.Another complaint that people have seems to be that Rey is too good at everything. I don't mind that at all and I think it is wonderful to see how her character will grow. She seems to be in a similar position as Anakin at the beginning of Episode II: a gifted prodigy who requires careful guidance, but will she listen to her tutors? And will she have a romantic subplot? But the thing that steals the movie for me is the villain. And I don't mean Snoke. Kylo Ren is something both new and familiar: he's an insecure Darth Vader, a menacing villain whose heart might not be in it. He is troubled, and his soul is twisted. He is not a cold killing machine, on the contrary, he is constantly in pain. He is reminiscent of a younger Darth Vader, the tortured Anakin Skywalker, who he so greatly admires. Now there are those who don't like him because he's an angsty teenager, the type who yells at his parents, smokes in defiance and listens to Linkin Park. And he is. But unlike Anakin, who was wooden and unlikeable, he is believable and relatable in his angst. He is a tragic hero, for sure, but the movie doesn't glorify his tragedy but makes us see the irony of it. He is as funny as he is brooding. A great combination for any fan of 'Angel', the TV show about a vampire with a soul."

Shame to Lucas for selling out to these guys. was he in need of cash?As crappy and boring as this is it did serve one purpose: saving money on the gazillion other Star Wars the people who took over walt Disney's company and made a den of bad behavior and greed of it. I will not pay for anything else these greedy Neanderthals and director/producer have their name on.

" alright on its own but horrible as a member of the star wars franchise
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,1,"i a writing this review just to get my voice out there about the problem with this film which many others agree with. this film shows how Disney is turning star wars into a money generating industry just like what has been done with marvel, they are all the same and people continue to watch them, the force awakens has demonstrated that they are willing to do the same. the movie is pretty much a new hope! it even has another death star! what were they thinking!, there is not one bit of originality in this film and it frustrates me. i mean on its own its a decent film but when you consider the past films and how this film has just copied them it just ruins the franchise. that is something that the prequels did well, although they weren't good movies from a character or story construction point of view they did do a good job of being original and fitting into the star wars universe, expanding the mythology and showing a time that was different to the original saga, the force awakens doesn't even do this, we are just thrown back into a situation where the empire is attacking again! there is nothing new. i hope i contribute to expressing the fan disappointment of this film"
" How come i've never seen this before, oh wait...
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,1,"Started watching it because well its been out a few years and I haven't seen it, half way through I realize I have seen it, but surely I was interrupted before finish, right? And when I get to the end I must admit I have seen all of it before, it was just so utterly unmemorable I completely forgot about it. ""Force Awakens"" is a sad, sad attempt at recreating ""A New Hope"", Disney must have figured they can just take the New Hope storyline change some characters, throw out all the meat and hey presto, a new episode. Prequel trilogy will live in infamy for daring to break from the model of original trilogy, but episodes 7 and probably 8 and 9 will just be forgotten in trashbox of movie history with all the other crap."
" Great movie
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"People only gives bad reviews all because there's no Paul walker, Vin diesel, or Dwayne Johnson in it. It all matters on looks these days not the plot or comedian, just looks. Moana is boring and not even funny people only gave it good reviews all because Dwayne Johnson was on it not the plot itself. The light saber fight was good the sound effects sounds so awesome and it's awesome when more than 1 event is happening throughout the star wars films. Once again people only gave it bad reviews all because there's no Paul walker in it or Dwayne Johnson or Vin diesel. People only rate movies base on looks more than the plot and comedian."
" Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens – Review
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens – Simply an outstanding piece of cinema. Lemme start with the story; Firstly straight from the beginning the iconic rolling credits mixed with John Williams amazing score puts a massive grin on my face, the actual credits explain the following story very clearly. The story itself is told beautifully through JJ Abrams vision who does justice and more to George Lucas' universe. JJ manages to perfectly pace the film with no scene being boring or useless. A huge amount of pressure paid off.Chewbacca and Han Solo in a still from the Star Wars: The ForceThe striking visuals are so delightful to look at with vibrant colours and great cinematography, your eyes never look away from the screen with every gorgeous frame. A step up from the prequels and their awful CGI it is a breath of fresh air to see practical effects used in this film. Furthermore, the humour is quite surprising, with BB-8 gaining a lot of laughs, even if it is just a robot it has lovely characteristics like many of the human characters.Regarding the characters – they all done an incredible job. In my opinion, the stand out performance was Adam Driver who plays Kylo Ren, an awesome antagonist who shows his dominance and emotion through his body language. Alongside him is Domhnall Gleeson who also stood out for me although not being in it much he does steal every scene he is in with his passionate anger. Meanwhile the two protagonists Finn and Rey both have excellent chemistry through humour and emotion – not to forget Poe Dameron a cool and lovable person played by the impressive Oscar Issac, credit to JJ for telling everyone's story just enough for us to keep on wanting to learn more about them, a great set-up for Rian Johnson to further our understanding of the characters.Filled with pleasant and 'unpleasant' surprises, this is a film that will go down as one of the greats, with excitement, laughter, sadness, happiness and a range of other emotions pumping throughout the whole film. Flaws? A few minor ones but nothing major that ruins the film. Best film of 2015 – Easily. Best Star Wars film I've seen – Yes. Will be interesting to see how Rian Johnson reacts to this with Episode VIII. To conclude, just go watch it."
" Stupidity is strong!
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,1,"People want to believe this movie was good, in fact it wasn't.The way relationships are portrayed In Ep7 is that if someone rescues someone else they are instantly BFFs. And everyone gets on just great. And completely trusts everyone else. All the time. The only relationship between protagonists with any kind of complexity is Han/Leia.There are more ridiculous coincidences in the first 30 minutes of Ep7 than in the original trilogy combined. It was just a series of implausible events connected by coincidence.Copy/paste, another Death Star.Anyone who picks up a lightsaber is instantly a master. Finn can use it without any problem, and Rey... well now that she knows the Force is real, she's a jedi and can fight a highly trained Sith."
" Fresh but Familiar
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,Star Wars the Force Awakens is a great new installments to the Star Wars universe as it adds a great jumping on point for new people to the franchise. However it provides a great continuation of what die hards love about Star Wars as people who love all previous installments in the franchise will feel right at home. Force Awakens brings a great cast with some familiar faces into the film which provides it with a strong foundation for success in the future as it has successfully reinvigorated the franchise.Even though this film has taken cues from a New Hope in terms of story and characters it hardly works to its detriment in the grand scheme of things. All in all a great film and a must see for all Star Wars fans and those looking to get into the wide world of Star Wars.
" What a shame and lack of imagination
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,1,"The Force Goes to sleep in this Disney/Abrams reboot marketing product.No talent, imagination nor any creativity. First, the script is a boring remake combining story plots/structure from IV,V,VI.I can't believe they dared to give us another Death Star and to hide data in a robot on the run on a sand planet. Pathetic.Abrams is definitely a BAD ROBOT, who robotically copycat without any talent a Master creation. He made of an epic tale a TV reboot for stupid teens.Bad casting, bad acting.Not a single spectacular,mind blowing scene.You go to see this for Han, Leia (Luke?) and their great actors.Star Wars VII is a fraud, a bad, shameless enterprise, with a very stupid, emotionless script.Definitely, don't touch other artist's creation if you're only after the check and have no talent.The great thing about VII, it make you miss the genius of visionary George Lucas. Even his ""fans hated"" prequel look now like masterpieces of visual and entertaining magic."
" You can buy the Star Wars logo but you can't buy the universe.
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"Star Wars: The Force Awakens (TFA) is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. To be fair I have not yet seen Rogue One which may possibly be worse but I find it unlikely anything can be worse than episode VII. TFA fails to deliver in every category you can use to measure a film. It's story is nonsensical and trying too hard to be something it's not. It results in a rehash of episode IV. George Lucas and his team would spend months if not years planning and creating new worlds and characters to discover and explore with the audience. Disney has chosen to try and make as much money as possible, now I understand the nature of the industry and making movies with gigantic budgets like Star Wars demands a return, but if you go into the creative process with only money on your mind you have already set yourself up for failure. Because of the exaggerated and unjust criticism of the prequel trilogy, Disney has knee jerked and tried to recreate the original movie with new characters. Based on that sentence it's not an entirely bad idea. New planet, new aliens, new antagonists, sounds OK. But the success comes not from the idea but from the execution. This is where the movie was most disappointing, every aspect is executed poorly.For myself music is one of the most important ingredients in a Star Wars film as it provokes the same emotions experienced by the protagonists on screen. It can get your blood pumping, or reduce you to tears. In the movie industry there is no one better to compose this than John Williams, he is a master of his craft and one of the main factors of Star Wars' success over the decades. He shares a close friendship with George Lucas and due to this was able to more accurately compose for specific planets, characters and scenes. You could watch the film blindfolded and still feel the same emotions as the characters on screen. In TFA it was obvious that John Williams did not feel the same love and passion for this new iteration. He would have known that George's suggestions and ideas were thrown into the trash and the executives were only looking for some quick money. It's hard to put your heart into something that you know should not even be made. On top of this TFA completely destroyed the ending of Return of the Jedi and has tarnished the name Star Wars to all the fans. Disney own Star Wars now they can tell you this is canon but it's up to you as a fan to decide for yourself. It's a fictional universe created by George Lucas and they say that all of the EU is canon, unless contradicted by the films i.e. I-IV. Well TFA IS contradicted by IV, V, VI I know these characters would not behave as they do in the film. The galaxy would not allow the first order to rise up out of no where and they would not allow the construction of a star killer base. Han Solo would not act as he does in the film, Luke would not lose to the Knights of Ren and go into hiding, he would continue fighting until his last breath using the knowledge of Yoda and Obi Wan to defeat any dark side users who attempt to destroy the Jedi and the people of the galaxy. So Disney if you want to cast aside the man who created this universe then please do not be upset when the fans cast you aside also. You can buy the rights to use the Star Wars logo but you can never buy the Star Wars universe because it only exists in one place, inside the mind of George Lucas."
" Disappointing, Lackluster, No heart, No passion, and a waste of time
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,1,"I Always liked the first three star wars movies and by that I mean EP's 4 5 and 6. They have fantastic story's, great characters, amazing music, and are a memorable experience.The prequels have a lot of haters and where considered to be bad films. I myself wasn't a fan of them due to there boring story lines, characters and writing/direction, but this movie is even worse IMO. The prequels at least had impressive action scenes and an epic musical score where's this film falls flat in all areas. This film was so over hyped and everyone was telling me how good the film was.So I said to myself you know what I am gonna go see it and after seeing it I thought to myself THIS SUCKS, REALLY SUCKS. Here's the reasons why I though It sucked1. EP 4 A New Hope Storyline all over again and it feels like a poor man's version of it to. This feels lazy, tedious, and more of a waste of time if you have watch A new Hope a thousand times!2. The villain Kylo Ren sucked, He was not intimidating, funny, serious, or interesting in the slightest.To me he was a poor man's version of Darth Vader.3. Lackluster music and the only tune I remember is the opening theme that's played in the other films.4.The acting is lame, the writing is really stupid, and the new characters are bland since they don't have any major flaws and are like Mary sues! Ray who is able to use the force with little to no training whatsoever and is a bland character overall.Fin a character that the film didn't need at all and was there to bring bad comedy to the film. The returning characters don't really do a lot either. 5. A lot of plot holes in the story, The jokes that they come out with are forced and cheesy.Overall This film was a waste of time and money. The film was boring, cheesy, forgettable, lackluster, annoying and if you are a true star wars fan you will properly agree with me."
" Hot water is discovered yet, IT IS REMAKE
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,6,"I make it high 6 only because it is part of STAR WARS franchise. This movie is a remake of New Hope. There was girl (not Jedi) but daughter of Jedi, sand planet, Chewbaca, Solo, princess and new Darth Vader (very weird kind of Darth Vader because looks funny without helmet not scary as everybody expected. Emperor also have silly name Snoke. Like i bad comedy. Fight scene of girl and call it Darth Vader is catastrophe. One regular girl not Jedi girl almost defeated Darth Vader with lightsaber?? Isn't Darth Vader guy with force powers choke? throwing objects telepathic? Story is predictable and very similar with first STAR WARS. I am shocked with high 8 for this movie from film critics. People who wrote pro film critics don't know anymore how to watch movie??? This is worst movie of all Star Wars franchise. And new Rogue 1: a story of Star Wars is much better movie."
" It was OK, however it does not have an original storyline.
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS!Star Wars: Force Awakens was OK when went to see it, however there were some obvious elements from the original trilogy brought in for instance: the mentor type character being killed by a familiar face, a ""son"", this is a link between Obi-Wan and Anakin because as said in Attack Of The Clones Anakin considered Obi-Wan as his father, and Obi-Wan was struck down by his former apprentice, as Han Solo was by his son Kylo Ren. In addition the obvious copy from Star Wars 1977 brought into Force Awakens was that there was as said in the movie itself ""it's another Death Star"". Also the planet Tatooine has been renamed Jakku and the R2-D2 character has been replaced by BB-8. With all these facts there are some good points to the movie itself like the practical backgrounds instead of using CGI, which in fact was one of the main issues people had with the prequels. My final point is that I think that this movie tried to disregard the prequels because there were no references that I had seen within Force Awakens which I think was not the best of choices film makers could of made. Overall it was OK but needs to make a more original storyline."
" I advise all the actors to quit the profession right now en masse
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,"before they embarrass themselves anymore. Just quit.. learn from the dude who played Anakin in the prequels and just disappear because you suck.. really really embarrassing. At least Jar Jar Abramstein makes lots of cash for the synagogue that is Disney but the lot of you want-to-be actors should just give it up. Although we have been flooded by women lead films lately, I must say that Star Wars Rogue One was the best of its kind. Photography and scenario are great and the end of the movie is ""as good as it gets""...especially right before the end credits.Although some people may note that they will go anywhere with the portrayal of Star Wars culture, you can easily overlook this and avoid the Disney trap by recognizing this is vomit. Unless you are truly addicted to Disney's formula, stay home and stream some good porno on your TV instead."
" Quite possibly the worst movie ever!(IMO)
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,"People said when episode I came out that it was the best Star Wars ever. But in time when the hype cooled down they realized how stupid that movie was. This one is no exception. Please do not take this review personally, it's just an opinion.Story: As we all know now it's a massive copy of the original trilogy's story. And if you pay attention literally everything is exactly the same like episode IV for at least 1/2 of the movie. Just taking things from the OT and making them bigger and more bad-ass or more modern doesn't make for a good film making. But yeah... whatever, moving on. Another major issue this movie has is that it doesn't give any context to anything since it copies episode IV. That worked there because it was the first movie, but here... nah... there are so many questions like how the Resistance and the First Order came to be, how Maz got Luke's light-saber, how does San Tekka got the map to Luke, how does Finn and Rey master light-saber so quickly, who were the knights of Ren or how did Kylo betrayed Luke? Just some questions that came to my mind. Aside from that the story felt rushed, more of the same Rebel vs Empire stuff without any context whatsoever to it. Even the last light-saber battle between Kylo and Rey is a copy of Obi vs Anakin in episode III, bad guy gets injured and then is taken to his master to be trained again(similar to Anakin being taken back to Emperor to be rebuild and basically become Darth Vader).Plot holes: Finn and Poe crash near the same village Rey was in although they crashed from space, Han and Chewie just so happens to find the Millennium Falcon in the same moment Rey and Finn were in. Rey just so happens to know how to pilot a spacecraft or use the force even though she only heard about it for like couple of hours or so. Ground breaks just between Rey and Kylo to separate them so conveniently at the end, so that we could see another face-off in the future.The tone and fan service is just exaggerated. The movies just doesn't know when to stop with all the Easter eggs and OT references that in the end the whole movie feel like a parody to the old movies. At least the prequels had a original story and creative. The prequels failed due to poor film making. This episode instead is a cheap written homage to the original saga, and doesn't stand on it's own. The star-killer is just another stupid addition that makes no sense whatsoever from how it powers to it's weaknesses(episode IV and VI), that show how idiotic the plot of this movie really is, having the First Order not learning anything from the Empire's failures?The soundtrack is bland and probably the worst. Aside from Rey's theme there is no other track that stands on it's own. Kylo's theme is a rehash of Imperial March. At least Rogue One had a more decent one and that soundtrack was composed, arranged and mixed in only 4 months while this movie had 5 months just to mix it with the movie itself.The cast is totally underwhelming. Although there are guys with so much potential, they are wasted due to the lack of vision the writers had in mind. Just one example: Finn decided to leave the storm-troopers because of the killing he would have needed to do, yet in his escape he kills more of his former colleagues which contradicts his character motivation completely and makes no sense whatsoever.TFA betrays the legacy of the original trilogy. After Han dies Chewie screams and Leia is looking sad. Yet when they arrive Chewie pasts Leia as nothing happened. If this was a continuation of the OT they would have been devastated, especially Leia, since she had a son with Han. Luke running away because one student betrayed him? Leaving more death and destruction in the galaxy? The old Luke confronted Vader when everyone told him to run away, yet here he's so scared that he hides on Oliver Queen's island. It just inconsistent. Aside from the artistically view and execution this movie had critical issues, and it was made only to please prequel haters. And I think JJ Abrams is not to blame here as much as the writers and especially Disney is. As Lucas clearly states in this video - : search these exact words ""What Happened in George Lucas' STAR WARS EPISODE VII"" on YouTube and you'll find the thing I'm talking about - he backed out because Disney wanted to make a copy version of episode IV. Surprise? Well Disney succeeded in destroying the Star Wars saga through this idiotic movie.PS: You want to see an entertaining sequel to an old franchise, go check Jurassic World. OK it's a cliché ride but at least is more original than this piece of cr6p."
" Very funny
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,1,"I think TFA was very funny. So funny that the whole film became a joke.But seriously, JJ Abrams failed miserably. How the character development of Han solo from ep 4-6 was totally ignored really strucked me and after his death that leia hugged Rey (almost a stranger) instead of chewie is just..... a disgrace. And rey being a mary sue is just so annoying. Finn had a lot of potential but they ruined it. Why did he laugh after killing dozens of stormtroopers with the fighter?? He left because his best friend (also a stormtrooper) died and he was shocked. And he didn't want to kill the villagers of course. Just sooo unrealistic. And rey closing her eyes for 10 minutes while fighting with kylo was just hilarious."
" A Disgrace to Humanity!
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,1,"A Disgrace to Humanity! Only for the Immature Mind. Garbage! Insult to Intelligence! This is Not a movie. It is childish nonsense. Pure Crap.Updated - July 2, 2017 This is a sad excuse for a movie. Go see the original 1977 and Empyire. Acting is crap. The music is crap. The plot is copied from the original. The comic is crap. The force? Where? Kylo Ren, as a villain, as an actor, costume, actions, crap. Leia, Han Solo - crap. Luke? crap. Fin and Po - crap. BBwhatever8 - crap. Chubacka - good. Rey - character, actor, costume, supergirl - crap.Where was the great music. Where was the great acting? The original had James earl jones, OB1, Peter Cushing. Even Luke and Leia. Han Solo always sucked, his character was always a dirtbag. Harrison Ford is way overrated.I have read all reviews and continue to read. It is my personal social experiment. I saw the move first time a couple of months ago. The crap is confirmed. Sad to say this movie and the love that it receives also confirms that the deception will continue.What's the story with the 10 star reviews? Non-objective nonsense! Saying it's great does not make it great. It just confirms that you are a liar! July 2, 2017 – Update to early review: I am not a huge Star Wars fan. I am a fan of art. I do not think the original, 1977, movie was great. I thought it was a good movie, B rating. It should have been better. The acting on the most part were subpar. Han Harrison Ford Solo is garbage, I never thought he was a good actor, he just fell into the parts. William Kirk Shatner is much better. Luke was OK, not great. Lea was also only OK. What was great was Vader's look and the voice ""James Earl Jones"" and his dialogue. OB1 was good, better than Luke and Lea, but still not great. Peter Cushing, was great, but he was only in it for 3 minutes. I think what made the original work was the good story, the music, characters and the visuals. I did not enjoy the jokes.Comedy should be left to comedy movies, not sci-fi, or horror. Empire was almost as good as the first. Return pretty much sucked. No OB1, no Peter Cushing, and we had a bunch of puppets running around. So that was a C movie. But at least the story continued. The prequels succeeded because of the story. They were all C movies. Now we have, the Force Awakens. Admit it, it is a rip off of the original. You can make any excuse you want. The best is if you've never seen the original, and just want to sit and watch some wild scenes and never think about it again, you'll have a good time while you're watching it. But, some of us like stories that make sense. Especially ones that continue from prior episodes. That's where we have a major problem. I don't know or remember every aspect of what happened before, but at least it should make basic sense. Force Awakens does not.I have been reading and studying the IMDb reviews for the Force Awakens as a social experiment. I'd like to know how the thinking of my fellow humans think of this mess to how our society is right now. Can you see what's happened? We in the First World, are the ones that have. And when we want something else, we just buy it. If you're heavy, instead of exercising and watching what you eat, you get a surgery. If you're getting old, plastic surgery. If your tits are too small, then no problem, put it on the card and enlarge them. If you smell like crap, buy some expensive perfume. Got the point? Force Awakens, is a lie. Most movies are. But there's something beyond that. Beyond the money that the studios want to raise. It's a hypocrisy! Movies are a form of education, of propaganda. Rather than teaching us something of value, to think for ourselves, this movie just gives us more candy and cake. Don't worry. If you have enough money or a credit card you too can have that surgery!"
" shallow and boring remake of Episode IV
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,5,"List ten things you remember about Episode IV. At least nine of them are in Episode VII, but done here with far less depth and energy. So of course anyone who has seen the original will be disappointed by this movie, but even judged alone on its own merits, The Force Awakens is a poor effort. The visual effects are the only element done with any degree of competence, but when the plot is predictable and unbelievable (even relative to science fiction in general) and the characters are one-dimensional caricatures with little to no arc, good visuals aren't enough to make a movie worth watching. And finally, the closing set-up for Episode VIII flushes any and all vitality that was present, down the drain (another way in which this remake falls short of the original)."
" Disney sucks big, long and hard
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,2,"Disney sucks big, long and hard.The group of clichéd formulaic accountants in charge at Disney sure have the formula down at for sucking cash out of the losers.Everything they touch is nasty and gross. Finding nemo was perfect. Disney bought Pixar. now Finding Dory is as pleasant as listening to the trashy incestuous trump family fart upon the country. Did you watch Moana?? Oh my gosh.. what a cliché.. a princess, rebellious, her own way, sings.. how darn original. A first! Now with Star Wars J J Abrams, accountants' boy toy, has an idea. The idea? Why have an idea, just reboot the whole thing, steal the whole story and just swap orphan boy with orphan girl, but hey let's not waste with the padawan crap this girl is like Yoda times a thousand...The Force can go back to sleep.Disney is to pimps what j J is to escortsAs for acting, script, sense or continuity? that stuff bores me (said J J to his girlfriend - wife was away at her sister's house)."
