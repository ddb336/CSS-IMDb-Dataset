" No need to buy it.
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,5,"I like some aspects of the movie, but other parts could be improved. I like the sarcasm and the wit, but overall, it's just not ""fantastic"" enough to buy for my home library."
" surprisingly really nice movie
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,7,"Sweet , short and simple story, never felt bored. Good acting by all."
" Brilliant film
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,10,I have rewatched this film countless times because when I'm in a funk and feel like I'm just so different from everyone else this film brings my mood up and makes me feel that it's okay to be different. I would highly recommend this film to those who love romantic comedies that have a little extra character development.
" Entertaining Teen Movie With One Exception
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,8,"I've watched the movie a few times. It's entertaining. The characters are relatable. It definitely follows a formula but the dialog and acting are well done.There is one thing in the last scene that drives me CRAZY. In the last scene, the main character mentions she's going to Northwestern and her boyfriend is going to Ohio State so they can visit each other a lot. Do the writers have any concept of midwestern geography? This is a 6 hour drive. There's an entire state in between Illinois and Ohio. A little homework please."
" DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE DUFF
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,1,"I was ecstatic to hear a favorite book of mine was being made into a film, then when I saw it was nothing like it! DO NOT I repeat DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! Mae Whitman an excellent actress saved this wretched film with her incredible acting skills making it little more bare able to watch, but alas it was still a horrible experience. Nice try though."
" ""Courage, the Cowardly Duff""
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,6,"Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.Being that Dr. Jeong is the reason I finally watched this, I feel he was under utilized, but I was surprised to see Taylor Lautner and Bella Thorne delightfully playing jerks.Mae Whitman is an excellent actor and not necessarily known for being a ""looker"", but I never would have thought of her as a DUFF either, but I guess the concept is all relative. The movie does spend a lot of time making fun of her for being ""unattractive"" though.To be fair, there is a LOT of fun with her being awkward, which isn't the same thing as unattractive.This movie has the same sort of feel to it that ""Juno"", ""Superbad"", and ""Easy A"" have to them, all good high school social dramedies.While some of the movie feels like sketch writing for ""how to lie your way to victory"", it doesn't disappoint."
" A wholesome comedy
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,7,"In this tale which seems to take elements from Easy A and A Walk to Remember, Bianca (Mae Whitman) is told by her long-time neighbor and classmate, Wesley (Robbie Arnell) that she is the Designated Ugly Fat Friend (or DUFF for short).All Bianca wants is Toby, and will even help out Wesley to get that. In A Walk to Remember kind of format the unlikely friends become close and Toby is revealed to also believe in 'the duff' as he yearns for Jess and Casey, Bianca's friends, in the hopes that Bianca will hook him up.It all comes to a head with a She's All That-esque moment close to the end of the film. It's a low budget film, and there's not an all-star cast. I really only recognize Mae Whitman from Scott Pilgrim, Ken Jeong, and Allison Janney. Everyone else here feels forgettable.Although everyone fills out their roles and no one sticks out like a sore thumb, the acting is what sells the film. Mae has perfect timing for her on-the-button lines to finish off scenes. Mae is approachable, which makes Bianca approachable.I did find some things in the film out of touch, however. In the early stages of the blossoming friendship, Bianca dances and makes a fool of herself with a mannequin at the store while Wesley does his best to be Gerard Butler in The Ugly Truth. It's revealed that Wesley's ex is filming the whole situation and then later, Bianca accuses Wesley. It pains me how cringeworthy it is. Anyone with half a brain would realize he wouldn't do that and it was impossible to do it without Bianca noticing. The way that the recording is done is not subtle either.Aside from that there are sprinkles of comedic moments and quotes throughout the film. It's light-hearted and not raunchy like American Pie can be. It's got some taste and some brilliant jokes. Overall, it's worth a view and anyone who enjoys teen comedies with a bit of romance won't regret it."
" Heart-warming story!
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,10,The premise of the movie might be a little cliche. But it definitely brings back the 90s movie vibe where things are simple yet heart warming. You might also get an epiphany after the movie! A duff? Who me? Omg!
" ONE OF MY FAVORITE HIGH SCHOOL COMEDY
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,9,"This is actually one of the few teenagers comdies that I liked, cause it's so fun and full of the emotions that I've experienced in high school just like bullying and being invisible, everytime I see this movie I feel more confident about myself and just loving it."
" Doesn't try anything new, should have tried
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,6,"The DUFF is a movie that tries to take the teen rom-coms that everyone is used to and move them ahead into the 2010s. It attempts to show how the forming of cliques has changed and how relationship dynamics are different. However, if this movie is any indication, the more things change...the more they stay the same. I've seen this movie before and it was back in the 1990s, when another film was released that has almost all the exact same story beats as this one. I won't specifically mention the movie because that would spoil what happens in this film, but this is an extremely predictable plot if you've watched any other teen rom-coms. The only thing new this movie brings to the party is its concept of The DUFF, which stands for ""The Designated Ugly Fat Friend."" The DUFF concept suggests that in any group of friends there is the one person who is not quite as desirable as the others, who becomes ""the approachable one"" that people will use in order to get closer to their hotter friends.While I was more than a little offended by the mere implication that Mae Whitman (who plays the titular DUFF of the film) was in any way ugly or fat, I did appreciate that they clarified that those designations were more generalizations of people who filled this role, and not all people looked on as their group's DUFF are truly ugly or fat. I found the film to be watchable, and it has all the patented moments you expect from this genre. I was kind of hoping they were going to do something different with the story, because they laid the groundwork to take the plot in an unexpected direction and do something new and original. Don't get me wrong, doing the same old thing isn't bad, because it can still give you a warm fuzzy feeling. But in this case, they didn't do the same old thing in a way that was special enough to set this apart from countless other movies. I would watch The DUFF again, but I won't seek that opportunity out since it's so formulaic."
" Enjoyable teen movie
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,6,"I have been searching for watchable teen movie since ""Meangirls"" and have to say this one does it. Its quite suitable for 21st century but without too much of ""have to show im nice so i put at least two gay couples, black kid with two mums and indian girl"" which is really getting annoying. All props to male leading cast, Wesly managed to spice up typicall jock- star role in teen movies. I felt the scene of prom making out in classroom was a bit cringy and its certainly not award worth piece but very easy going for Saturday night with family/friends."
" Quite A Pleasant Experience
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,7,"The Duff is another movie in the expansive Teen RomCom, but it stands out for its charm, message, and how the plot is delivered. Is it perfect? No. However, Mae Whitman (Bianca) is charming throughout, Robbie Amell (Wesley) does good work, and Ken Jeong (Mr. Arthur) nails every scene he's in. Bianca Santos (Casey), Skyler Samuels (Jess), and Bella Thorne (Madison Morgan) play their roles effectively. Allison Janney (Dottie) also does well with her role.Yes, the plot pushes towards the genre rather than harsh realism during certain points as expected. Those moments within the teen genre of films is always present, and shouldn't take away from the overall feel of the film. Overall, The Duff is fun.Real Score: 6.6"
" Wonderful!
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,10,"The Duff is one of the best teen movies I have ever seen! It conveys this amazing message about learning to love yourself. Duff is just a word but the meaning is impactful. Mae Whitman is perfect as Bianca. She's witty and fun as she portrays a girl who is trying to make it through high school. Robbie Amell was also great as the love interest. He learned to fall for the real her.
Overall this movie will make you smile and laugh."
" Yet another
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,1,Teen movie where the teens are played by 30 year olds.
" Okay Teen Film
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,6,Another okay teen movie that lives by all the clich√©s
" Fairly typical with a few laughs
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,6,"My daughter pressed play on this movie, and I didn't mean to stick around and finish watching it, but somehow I did. I like a good high school comedy, and this had enough laughs to keep it going, but the story is so overused. Also, I wasn't happy with the outcome, as the good girl ends up with the guy who is a jerk. He doesn't fully turn around by the end, he's pretty much annoying the whole movie through."
" Wow
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,7,The beginning was on fire but little by little it came clear
" A Good movie that tries just a little too hard.
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,8,"Let's face it. With an army of high school feel good movies how do you make your mark? In the case of ""The Duff"" you leave in what should of remained on the cutting room floor. It's important you understand that did not hate this movie although it's extremely heavy-handed on some subjects. The actors were amazing though looked way too old to be in high school but if I were to judge this gem of a flim on that slight then they would all need to go. Great movie guys! Keep it up!"
" More than Watchable.
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,7,"Without the chemistry btw its two leads, this movie would not have worked. Plus, the supporting cast of adults helped. This movie was better than it had any right to be.Whitman has always been a talented actress. I look forward to her eventually getting some truly meaty movie roles."
" Awful
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,1,I'm disappointed that I can't give this movie a negative score if I could it would be a -6. I would rather have a lobotomy then watch this movie again. In a way it was a lobotomy.
" Relieved we have a smart and grounded addition to this genre
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,9,"Attempts made at this genre have turned my stomach in the past.
But it has also been breakthrough ground for many an actor, writer and director.In this day and age, originality or even a decent attempt at reinvigorating a tired story arc is rare but I was relieved and pleasantly surprised by this film.Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell have a commanding and heartwarming chemistry I honestly thought would never again be achieved in this age of shallow and genre over-kill. They gave a sincerity to the film that was its compelling foundation and saving grace, especially as they were given the term ""Duff"" to reckon with and make an endearing learning curve. Their interactions were a joy to watch and made for many an honest laugh which won this film comedic credibility.It also has Allison Janney. It also has Ken Jeong. It also has Romany Malco.
So, that's win for me too.It lost a point in not fleshing out Bianca's best friends. Maybe this was done on purpose but their dialogue lacked substance which I found bizarre amidst the rest of the film's promising and developed aspects.It does an admirable job in handling the awkward and the heart of the matter. It reflects on points and issues that could well be causing self-doubt among teens out there, indeed the world in general, especially in this social media-crazed society, and the film does so with a humour and timing that was welcome and unexpected.A definite recommend for any movie night. It's light, highly watchable and soon becomes a favourite."
" The Duff succeeds where other teen high school makeover comedies fall short
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,6,"For those familiar with the 2004 film Mean Girls I won't need to say any more than The Duff is Mean Girls rebooted - and yes, it's almost as good.The writers have infiltrated the most up to date tween-isms (which will leave older viewers/reluctant chaperones at a loss most of the time) but effort has been made to not talk down to those the filmmakers are emulating nor belittle the classroom issues which seem so insurmountable at the time.Films like The Duff live and die by their leads, on whose shoulders rest the narration as well as the storyline and luckily, Mae Whitman, (despite her 26 years) nails it as the humbly hilarious high-schooler, desperate to redress the balance of popularity, Bianca. She's as kind-hearted if a little more self-affirmed than Lindsay Lohan's Cady (Mean Girls) and miles from the pathetically doe-eyed 'heroines' treated to makeovers in girl-flicks of yesteryear.The Duff succeeds where other teen high school makeover comedies fall short due to all of the above sparking off each other in the same way Oscar shock-winning, sleeper-hit, Juno came out of nowhere and settled right into the 'classic' category almost ten years ago.All that having been said, you'll hate this unless you're female and under 16 or within the very specific age range of 25-29 and pining for the aforementioned girl-flicks The Duff appears to have been made in homage to."
" Great
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,10,"I loved absolutely everything about the movie! No need for storyline, great effects, fine actors and so on! I didn't really find that she was best friends with those girls to be realistic, it fitted perfectly! 10/10"
" TO THE POINT OF NEEDING HELMETS
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,8,"Bianca (Mae Whitman), Casey (Bianca A. Santos) and Jess (Skyler Samuels) are three BFFs. Bianca is the smart one and at 14 minutes into the film she realizes she is a ""DUFF"" (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) which is certainly better than being a BUFF (Big Ugly Fat F@#$) although she doesn't like the role even though she is neither fat or ugly.This changes Bianca's perspective on life, school, social standings, and her best friends. Bianca wants to go out with Toby Tucker (Nick Eversman) a boy who plays a guitar and has bangs. She gets the help of her childhood friend Wesley Rush (Robbie Amell), the high school jock who dates the hottest girl in the school (Bella Thorne) . Wesley needs help with chemistry which gives us the predictable formula results including the climax speech.The film is predictable from the title. It is teen oriented. DUFFs should love it.Guide: No real sex or nudity. Mom spouts an F-bomb near the end."
" If you love teen movies, you'll love this one!
",2019-06-08 00:00:00,8,"The Duff is the American teen comedy film Released in 2015 directed by Ari Sandel. It may seem like a teenage cliche, however, it addresses the labeling that young people put on each other, the insecurity and the importance of friendship.Duff is based on the book by author Kody Keplinger, which tells the story of Bianca Piper, a teenager in her senior year of high school, who is a funny and intelligent girl who does not care about the way she dresses. However, Bianca goes to a party and finds out by the most popular high school boy and her neighbor Wesley Rush that she is a ""Duff (designated, ugly, fat, friend)"". She does not accept being a Duff and ends up being paranoid and analyzing all the tribes of the school and finding other duffs.So Bianca ends up fighting with her friends Jess and Casey because they did not tell her that she was a duff and asks her neighbor's help to improve her look. In return, she helps him to study for the sciences that he is almost failing.They end up having many special and funny moments together that it is impossible not to laugh at and fall in love with the couple. I recommend the film because it has a great message about overcoming and how the main character deals with bullying in school, and how to reject the impositions that society places on us and to accept ourselves as we are.The cast features Mae Whitman from ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and Robbie Amell, ""The Flash"" Firestorm! It is a film that does not escape from the reality even turned by the adolescent industry that looks for romantic films that happen in the middle school but they present many important subjects and they do not focus only on the adolescent romance and it causes the viewer to reflect. The song ""All Night"" - Icon Pop is part of the soundtrack of the film.
After all the movie ended up winning 5 awards, one of them was the Teen Choice Award for ""Best Comedy Film""."
" ""Switch the Genders""
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,1,"(Everyone's favorite game)On top of containing generic teen drama and Ken Jeong, the film presents a very cringy, unrealistic, unhealthy, unfaithful, overused message that women can randomly punch their crushes in the face, storm into the boy's locker room, and call some dude's dick small (all unscathed of course) and still have a happy little romantic ending.Perhaps those locker room guys need to take a lesson or two from annoying anime girls. KYAAAAAAAA *throws every physical object in the room*"
" THE DUFF
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,8,"The Duff, this comedy romantic genre film, was released on February 20, 2015 in the USA. The Duff was written by Josh A. Cagan (screenplay) and Kody Keplinger (novel), a film that tells of a girl named Bianca who got a label ""The Duff"" because she was surrounded by beautiful and charming friends. Duff stands for ""Designated Ugly Fat Friend"", the name then made Bianca feel angry and became the beginning of Bianca's life change, Bianca began to get out of her comfort zone. Since she realized that she was the duff, Bianca began to have various problems, such as problems with her best friend, she got a bullying because of the videos circulating about her, and also definitely the love problems she experienced.
The film tell about love stories in high school are very interesting, in the whole film not only discusses romance, but also discusses a social relationship if viewed from the perspective of someone who is considered ""non-existent"". The
depiction of this film was correspond with the genre, a love story with a mix of comedy that is neatly packaged and right on target, although overall of the film dominates the element of comedy. Actors in this film can carry out their roles well and maximally so they can realize each character's, especially the female lead character, Bianca, played by Mae Whitman. Bianca in this film really portrays a person who can be said a ""geek"", lacking friendship relations, and also doesn't care about appearance, so the audience can further deepen her character. The film also raises the current situation, where social media can be a helper but can also destroy everything, in one scene in this film there is a part when Bianca's disgrace video is disseminated through social media so Bianca gets bullying, slipping the implicit meaning that the media social like a double-edged sword.
Maybe the audience at first was not interested in the initial scene in this film because it felt a little boring, but starting in the middle of this film it was very interesting with a series of events that could make the audience entertained because of the comedy and problem scenes. Not only that, maybe there are some scenes, that are just a glance not so clearly illustrated by the scene, and may make some viewers feel less interested, but overall the film is very nice. Viewers get a lot of moral value from this film, moral values are reflected in various situations and also portrayed lightly so they can be accepted by the audience. The most important moral value found in the film is ""no matter what the label is your way, only you can define yourself"" expressed directly by Bianca, actually there are many moral values contained in the film, such as don't feel inferior to yourself, do not easily misunderstand your friends, because friends who are always there for you, and also self-confidence is the key to everything."
" Duff movie interesting
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,7,A film that was expected not surprise but he did happily. Fun shows modern and contemporary themes with comic and natural touch. it presents an interesting terminology. It is predictable in parts of the plot and has cliches still the good parts of the film stand out more
" Average fun
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,6,Tbh when I saw the name of the film I presumed it was about a pregnant girl. Never the less it's a good enough high school comedy coming of age film. Nothing new or special but there's enough laughs to get by and it's a heartwarming enough story. Fits the bill for a quiet night in not paying complete attention with a takeaway perfectly.
" Pleasantly Surprised
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,7,"The TiVo guide rates this movie only 1 1/2 stars, so I wasn't expecting much. Nothing else was on so I decided to give it a shot and figured it might help me sleep. I don't typically watch anything involving high school students because I find most plots, or lack of, annoying or the characters irritating. Not so for this movie. It was a quirky, funny movie that had me smiling and laughing. The actors, none of whom I am familiar with, seemed to have been perfectly cast for their role. Sure, you knew where this was headed, but even so it was a fun ride to the end. I might watch it again just for the fun of it and catch expressions and gestures that I might have missed."
" Surprisingly Okay
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,6,"One of the better high school dramas I've seen but still has some common issues.
Comedy was not completely in my taste and the antagonist Madison is unrealistic in my eyes. The character just written to unrealistic to take seriously and some of the plot points felt they were thrown in to try and have a cohesive story"
" AH
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,8,OK THIS IS LITERALLY SUCH A RELATABLE AND ACTUALLY GOOD TEEN MOVIE IM-
" looks don't make the person
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that looks don't mean a damn things if you have a great personality or a great heart. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Shows promise then devolves into generic feel-good garbage.
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,2,"In the American film business, there are two types of teen comedies:1) Featuring a teenage guy as a protagonist, the message is almost always to never aim higher that what you are and be content with what you have - after all, hot girls are all shallow, so why not settle for your not-so-hot friend instead?2) Featuring a teenage girl as a protagonist, the message is almost always to never bother to improve oneself and that good things will be handed to you on a silver platter if you simply accept yourself.Both of the above are peddling toxic rubbish and both of the above are ubiquitous.The Duff is one of the those generic teen comedies that tries to pretend it's not formulaic garbage that's designed to lift up the self-esteem of not-so-popular girls by telling them that they don't need to do anything to improve themselves and they'll get everything handed to them on a plate anyway, but it is.It starts off promising when our main character, Bianca (played by the decidedly average-looking Mae Whitman - unlike older comedies where the plain girl was almost always played by a hot girl in disguise, at least Whitman actually fits the role of the unappealing, grumpy-faced friend), gets a rude wake-up call that she's actually not-that-cool by Wesley, played by the ever-reliable Robbie Amell. From then onward, Bianca decides to take her life into her own hands and become more appealing - starting from aggressively ditching her best friends and enlisting the popular Wesley's help in becoming ""un-duffed"".From that point onward, the movie falls apart. Wesley turns out to have had a secret crush on Bianca all along (and obviously, his much hotter sorta-girlfriend turns out to be a total b***h), Bianca's friends practically beg her to come back despite her acting horribly to them earlier and Bianca's actions never being brought up again and the end of the movie gives out a generic feel-good message that everyone sucks just as much as you do.The acting is cringeworthy across the board, with the possible exception of Amell, who at least seems to be trying rather than phoning it in like everyone else. Ken Jeong again tries too hard to be funny. Mae Whitman is serviceable, which was to be expected. Everyone else fails.I know that women are one of the biggest consumers of American mainstream media but this is not healthy. Encouraging teenage girls (and guys as well) to remain stuck in their ways and expect good things to come is a poisonous mentality. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this."
" Would not recommend
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,3,"Is this worth watching? 
Short answer: no.I'm a fan of Mae Whitman's, and I'm well aware I'm not the target demographic for this movie, so I went into this with a pretty open mind. However, teen movies don't have to be bad just because they're for teens, as Mean Girls has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.But it is bad. Not unwatchable, but bad nonetheless. It left me with a bitter taste in my mouth that stayed with me long after the movie ended. Why, out of all underwhelming teen films, did this one stand out to me? After my second viewing, I decided to read the book. And there, I got my answer.What most bugged me about The Duff before reading was the friendship between the main character, Bianca, and her two best friends, Casey and Jess. Or should I say, lack of friendship? We don't see these friends talking and interacting and, you know, being friends. They have maybe two very brief, very shallow conversations before they stop being friends. This is a huge difference between film and book. Bianca and her friends are extremely close, but have reached a point in their friendship where they don't always feel they can share everything, as sometimes happens in friendships. This is the foundation for the entire book. It's what makes Bianca's interactions with Wesley that much more weighted - the fact she has to look elsewhere for advice when her friends are right there. There is also never a moment in the book that suggests Bianca is lesser than her friends in any way; all notions about being the D.U.F.F are false and mostly self-inflicted. In contrast, this movie offers a heavily male perspective because it doesn't just pose the idea that Bianca might be the D.U.F.F - it actually forces her into the role. Instead of friendship, what we do see more of are male characters that don't matter in the slightest to the plot commenting about how hot the two friends are...as opposed to Bianca, who is just there. Sadly, both of the potential love interests in this movie, Wesley and Toby, reiterate this sentiment. As for how the friends negate this stereotype - they don't. They are literally just there to be called hot, to look hot, and not really say or do much else.So what is the message of the movie then? That being a D.U.F.F doesn't mean you can't get laid? Sure, a movie doesn't need to have a message, but then if you're just going to be a fun teenage romp, why is this the message you're 'casually' dropping in?Kinda disappointing. Also, the addition of Bella Thorne's character, whose name doesn't matter, is pathetic. Please stop with Bella Thorne and her mean airhead act. I know the writers couldn't do better, but we should still expect better."
" Not an Original Thought in Its Head
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,6,"In terms of high school movies, this movie is the DUFF. There are more attractive, interesting, exciting, less predictable, and better told stories out there. That said, I liked this charming little rom-com quite a lot, and had it been the only one of its kind then this easily could have been a strong 8. It's funny, it's cute, and it's got a lot to like.But then, the negatives: there's not a single original thing in this movie. It's just so utterly derivative of all the mean-girls / rom-coms in existence it's practically textbook stuff. There's just nothing new here, and in fact it's all just one rom-com trope after another, which doesn't sit that well with me.Sure there's the cyber bullying issue, but it's basically glossed over in the most superficial way as to make really no difference to the movie. But if you're willing to overlook the fact that it's taken all the best bits from all the other movies of its ilk, then this is actually a surprisingly heartwarming little movie. I was incredibly disappointed with the ending, but I guess that it was inevitable from the very start. I should have known better than to expect anything else from this kind of movie.6/10. Could do better. The two leads are great, in fact the entire cast is great. Ultimately, I guess when you're buying bubblegum you expect to get bubblegum, and that's exactly what you're getting here. The DUFF needs a few original ideas, but overall, watchable on a rainy day."
" Feel Good Entertainment
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,7,"I enjoy watching teen movies to see what the young generation is up to. This movie gives the modern sensibility on final year high school students wading through the confusing labyrinth of romance and dating mingled with the vicissitudes of friendship. All with the absence of any help from adults, who generally are causing more stress than they are helping out. Feel good entertainment even if there is a little too much voice-over needed to explain what Bianca is going through."
" the duo
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,8,"Very cliched , high school teen comedy which surprisingly entertained me . the story has a freshness , the leads have actual chemistry , kind-of new presentation keeps you smiling ."
" Make'em Laugh
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,8,"This adaptation of a Teen book is the classic ugly duckling turns swan story with really great laughs.Bianca learns she is the DUFF to her two gorgeous best friends. DUFF is Designated Ugly Fat Friend.What follows is Bianca learning who she really is, what friends mean, and with confidence you can handle any situation.The entire cast keeps the zingers flowing in every scene but the master may just be Ken Jeong. He is hilarious!"
" Trying and failing to be a John Hughes film
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,2,"Every modern teen film wants to be a John Hughes film. Everyone making a modern teen film aspires for it to become as beloved as a John Hughes film. Not every film though can be a John Hughes, and ends up looking like a bargain basement copy. This is one such film.There are good performances being given, and the script isn't half bad, but even two years later this film comes across as being dated (something Hughes's films don't 30 years later) and I doubt it will be remembered half as highly as the film makers seem to hope it will be in the DVD extras.It's a decent attempt, but not one of the better Hughes inspired teen films doing the rounds."
" Love this movie, a bit too much improvisation, but it's forgivable
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,10,"To me this movie is an instant classic. Love the plot, acting, characters, writing, even the ad-libs. Now just to get it out of the way it seems like much of the movie is improvised. Makes it seem unpolished/unfinished. Seems a bit rushed. But when you compare it to most movies these days this is truly a diamond in the rough. Would have been nice to have had less improvising. The older cast members are pros at it though. The younger ones kind played off like unprofessional, first draft, drama class kinda stuff. But I forgive it since this movie is so great.It does get a bit heavy handed with it's message I'll admit, another thing the ad-libbing does. But still it's good. Just feel like if it was more refined it would have been better received. The acting is great and casting is perfect. Everyone works well with each other. So many quotable lines from this movie, and funny scenes. I actually laughed out loud in this movie. The film is basically a well made make over movie. But with many laughs and lessons along the way. The pay off is nice and so many good comedic actors in this. Even the credits are funny! You can tell all the cast members had a blast with this. What happens when the set is too easy going, the whole ad- libbing thing. But even so the movie is a joy to watch already watched it a couple of times! Highly recommend it if you are a comedy, rom-com, and/or drama fan."
" I am a Duff
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,7,"I am a DUFF. I have always wanted to know my role in my group of friends, and now I have a term for it.This is a cute movie, and I can tell that this is one of those movies that I will watch every time it is on Freeform, FX or USA. It has a great cast with a lot of chemistry. Mae Whitman is an amazing actress, and Robbie Amell has charm for days and days. This will become a cult teen classic just like 10 Things I Like About You, Pretty In Pink and She's All That.With all that being said, this movie follows the classic teen formula so don't expect any surprises. Mean Girls and Easy A are a lot smarter than this flick. Also, Bella Thorne is a great actress and she does great with her role in this movie. Bullying is real, but people don't act like her in real life at that age. Every time her character came on screen, I cringed. I don't like to feel uncomfortable watching films like this. The thing that makes it worse is that this character isn't part of original book. I would have rather used that screen time for the main character's relationship with her friends.Still, this is a good film. I will add this to my Saturday afternoon ritual when it starts playing on cable."
