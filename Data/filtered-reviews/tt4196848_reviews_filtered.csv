" Worth seeing but it is . . .
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,9,"Worth seeing but it is at a much slower pace than most movies so you have to be patient. It is not really a ""Comedy"" as listed per my opinion.Do watch this when you are calm and relaxed because if you expect a lot of action and changes, you will not care for this movie.New plot, twist and all actors did a great job."
" A super underated good film
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,7,"Cant believed that this film never had the right receptionz from both audience and box office. Eddie should receive some awards by this performance. Didnt expect anything before it started, but tears left alone at the end of it. This is the movie that makes you love Eddie again."
" A movie about family & sacrifice
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,10,"If you want a feel good sometimes tear jerker... this is your movie. I've watched it several times and will put it right next to the lake house & meet joe black (my all time favorites). I don't often watch movies repeatedly, but this is one that just puts life in perspective for me. I think it's Eddie Murphy's best film!"
" Heartfelt sad story
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,8,"It's a nice sad story. Not Eddie Murphy doing comedy, it's a slower paced drama. It's well done though and worth the watch ."
" A serious side to Eddie Murphy
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,10,I never even heard of this film and didn't even know anything about the film. I'm from UK and no one I know has even heard about the film when I mentioned it. It's really refreshing to see Eddie Murphy in this type of a role instead of comedy roles all the time. This film made made me see the other side to him and it was well worth it. Has to be one of my favourite films. The story was great and I would suggest before sitting down to watch this film getting your tissues out and ready as this is a very emotional film! definitely a 10 star from me.
" Beautiful Movie Based On True Story
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,10,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's tells a heartwarming story...(and my fave kind), which is based on a true story. I think it's one of Eddie Murphy's best. I've watched it three times already. Wish Murphy was in more movies."
" Good movie
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,8,I liked the movie. It was deep movie. It was mysterious and intriguing.
" gave this movie a 10
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"I don't remember the last time I saw a movie in one night, because movies now are like a long commercial, like a long trailer, not really a meaningful story, or maybe this movie hit me harder than it hits most, but it hit me. It touched my soul, the tragedy and beauty in every simple life, every life is precious and Mr. Church reminds you that. Each actor plays their part stelar, the flow of the movie perfect. I saw a review, there aren't many, on youtube and there were these 4 black guys and they were offended Mr. Church is a cook to a white family and because he was manered. Let's get this straight, the black character has his stuff together waaaaaay better than the white people in the movie, he is never a servant, he is payed for a job and from there they become family, but it is not what those 4 guys were saying, they were projecting. The movie is wonderful."
" A great serious movie.
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,10,"I've never saw this movie.The second best Eddie Murphy.
Will watch again."
" Excellent Movie! Simply refreshing!
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,10,I have found this movie to be amazing and breathe taking all in its self! I would recommend everyone to watch this movie because you will not be disappointed.
" Absolute Garbage
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,3,"Eddie Murphy was awesome as usual, but not even Eddie Murphy could save this trash of a movie. Charlie is a mean little girl who grows up to be just as awful as an adult. Mr. Church saved his own money to take care of her and her mom for 6 years. He even put Charlie through college, all for her to get knocked up, drop out, and end up at his place mooching off of him. Her best friend, Poppy grew up to be rich and successful, and her high school crush Owen grew up to become a doctor. Charlie grew up to be a single mom who works at a diner, even though she went to a prestige college on a full and free ride. All this movie did was piss me off."
" In my opinion
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,"Best heartfelt movie I've seen in a long time. This is a tribute to Eddie Murphy's genius. He is one of the most prolific and diverse actors who can play a range of characters and in each role, he is believable and endearing at the same time. A must see for times such as these and the cast is awesome as well. Kudos and Eddie, please continue to share your magic."
" Excellent and so heartfelt
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,"Eddie Murphy did An amazing job in this role, and I'm so glad I stumbled upon this little gem. It was one of the best films I've seen in a long, long time. I wish it had gotten the press it deserved so everyone could be aware of Mr. Murphy's incredible range. Very well done!"
" worth watching
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,10,Eddie murphy as a serious actor...love his portrayal of mr church..
" Such a good movie
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,8,"Never heard of this movie before seeing it on prime. Eddie Murphy in a serious role, nails it too. This is a simple moving movie. Good acting by all. It is a little predictable but that's ok."
" A secret Gem
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,10,"A lovely calm story, apparently hated by the elitist morons, under rated and under promoted by the industry, but rising above it all in beauty."
" Surprisingly not funny. That's a good thing.
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,7,"It's rare to see a comedian in a serious role. He nailed it so good. This film has no comesy elements which was suprising. I'm not sure why cast a comedian in a serious drama, but it worked flawlessly. This film was great, just the protagonist was terrible, she was so annoying, ruined this great drama."
" Bravo
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,10,"My sense of humor and the humor that Eddie Murphy usually displays in his movies does not match. I watched Mr. Church with some trepidation. But, it was brilliant. Eddie Murphy plays a sensitive, quiet beautiful man. The rest of the cast is wonderful too but Eddie Murphy was a wonderful surprise! I hope to see him in more of these kind of movies."
" It's nice to feel a pulse
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie gives you back your faith. Our humanity allows us to place trust in others without worry ...for the majority of us this is the case.
We have a guardian angel who will pop up out of no where to provide a lending hand."
" Wow!
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,8,"I'm feeling quite ashamed right now. I saw Eddie Murphy, and thought something funny. Boy, what a wonderful surprise. Mr. Murphy, is a truly a talented actor. I for one am glad I stayed with this movie. What an unsuspected, but clever surprise.This has a few tear jerk moments, a lot of smiles. However, the most important thing... Someone showing everyone, he's an actor. A pretty great one, too. We need more of these stories being told."
" Eddie Murphy at his best.
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,9,"I rarely give higher than eight stars. I added one for Eddie Murphy's outstanding performance as a dramatic actor. The movie is bittersweet as the bond of friendship grows, yet you know the inevitable outcome of one of the pivotal characters. Best watched with a box of Kleenex nearby."
" Brilliant
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,10,What a beautiful heartfelt and unique story. Eddie Murphy is brilliant and should have had far more recognition for this movie and it should have been promoted to the public. One of my favorites.
" stumbled on this movie by accident
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,10,Great performances by britt robertson and eddie murphy. not for comedy fans or star wars fans just a heartfelt movie based on a true story. this didn't get any promotion from hollywood which is no surprise. this is my favorite murphy movie in the last decade. just hope more people sit down and experience this show.
" If there was ever a time the critics were wrong!!
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,9,"Then this is it.I seriously do not know what film the critics were watching but, this is an absolutely fantastic film. You will see a performance from Eddie Murphy you haven't seen since Dreamgirls. In fairness, I think his performance in this film is a country mile better so, If you enjoyed him in Dreamgirls, You will be floored by his acting in this film.Its an actual crime he got no Academy nomination for this film.No spoilers here. I implore you to give this film a view. Emotions you thought you might have lost, will all of a sudden come back to you.If you are still reading this review .....Why? Go watch Mr Church right now!"
" Accidental Diamond
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,10,"This is a great film that I found only four years after its release. Where has Mr. Church been hiding? One theme in the film is that some diamonds are ours if we only realize that they have been given to us. The film Mr. Church demonstrates that theme.
Acting performances are exceptional, especially given the young age of so many of the actors. Eddie Murphy delivers a complex characterization of the enigma named Henry Church. Many of the other portrayals are so well done that I cannot mention them all. This film only brought me to tears a couple of times but they were happy tears to behold such a fine story brought to life by an amazing cast.
Why has it been ignored? Is it because it depicts actual multi-racial relationships? Is it that Americans become so attached to the Marvel Universe stories that we can no longer connect with family stories?
If you miss watching this film, you risk losing the diamond that has been given to you."
" Like a bad joke without a punchline
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,1,"Spoiled and rude daughter grows up into a spoiled and rude woman riding piggyback on Mr. Church who's an awesome cook, painter, pianist and gardener. He listens to jazz and only reads classics. But who is he and why does he visit a club on his spare time...? Very early on I realized that I didn't really care. The movie is just too many clichés and the relationship between Me Church and Charlie is dull. It's basically like this: Man takes care of mom and daughter, then mom died but daughter gets pregnant with new daughter. Then man takes care of mom and daughter again until he dies."
" Brilliant. Heartbreaking. Eddie Murphy reaches a newfound level of adoration
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,10,"I asked my girlfriend to watch this with me and she said no because the trailer looked too sad. Boy was she right, this movie hits so hard in the feels but is still somehow so easy to love!
I plan on rewatching this with her as soon as I can trick her in to believing it's ""really not that bad..."""
" Enjoyable from beginning to end
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,9,"I don't know how I just recently came to realize this move existed, but I'm glad that I did. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Like another user pointed out, there's no action and no main climax; it's just wonderful acting and storytelling throughout. It was nice that the optimism of the characters offset what was otherwise a pretty sad movie. It was definitely worth the watch."
" Oh wonderful surprise
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,10,"Oh wonderful surprise. I'm so happy to see Eddie Murphy starring in a movie that has nothing to do with anything like the we see in the movies today This is a big surprise considering most of his movies. I know he's a good actor, and this movie shows it. It's too bad it's rare to find movies like this anymore. I have been looking for a movie I could really enjoy without the sex, violence and bad language that is found in most movies. The fact that it brought races together, and showed the theme of friendship that transcends age and race is a rare find indeed. I hope Hollywood is able to make more movies like this. I don't care if the critics liked or didn't like this movie. I think viewers know when a good movie is worth watching."
" 6.5 endung could be better
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,7,"The movie is just good not that great ,the mother mary was pretty and her daughter also ..ijust hope in the end if owen mary charlote it will be happier ending and the perfect ending for such movie like that"
" The key is JAZZ !
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,8,"A story of friendship, building up to turn into a proper definition of a family. The movie is about offering love to others and save their lives, but in the process, your life gets saved in return. A really beautiful cast, who bring meaning and depth to this lovely movie. And as it goes ... "" the key is Jazz"""
" A lifelong story
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,7,"This movie is a little different in a sense where there is no REAL action or drama or any certainty of what it is. It is a story about one family life.What I loved was that it never shows these modern baits like blood, sex or even birthgiving even though all of that was in the scenario. They just skipped it because movie wasnt about that. Its a timeline. Its even a little old fashioned in a sense where old movies never hurry. Its not slow, its free from all that triple A movies and its mostly about love.I understand that this movie fails in many ways and its not mainsteam. We can even see how gross and budget differ. Its technically a failiure but i want to say thank you to the whole team who worked on this movie that filled my evening with warmth. Thank you"
" OUTSTANDING FILM!!!
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,10,"There is something special about this film!
MUST WATCH!"
" Heartwarming.
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,10,"This one got under the radar, beautiful film and I'm not afraid to say I cried.
Eddie Murphy shows that underneath his comedy chops he really can act.
Hope he makes more serious films to show of his talent.
A must see film if you have a heart."
" Beautiful Movie
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,9,"This movie is so beautiful. I'm glad that I've seen this movie. This movie would make you smile for sure. This movie has a lot of feelings. Love the chemistry of Eddie Murphy. This movie has all the love that you need in your life, someone who would love you unconditionally."
" I was expecting Will Smith?
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,10,"This movie was recommended by my brother over the phone one night several weeks ago. He gave a brief description and named Eddie Murphy as the star, but in my mind, based on the story line, I envisioned Will Smith since he does quite a few heart tugging movies, and Eddie in such a role did not compute.
When I started watching there was Eddie Murphy and it threw me a little, and then when the young girl goes into her Mom's room and said ""There is a Black man in our kitchen fixing breakfast!"" I was expecting a Murphy comedy with a tragic tilt at some point. What I got was something all together different!
This movie was so touching and engrossing that I quickly told my daughter about it and between she and I we have suggested it to about a dozen people and all loved it, and I am sure have recommended it to others.The resounding question has been, ""Why have I not heard about this before?"" Followed by, ""How many awards did it win?"" Sadly few if any and it was panned by the social engineers that deem themselves ""movie critics!""
How so many people can watch this movie and think it is one of the best they have seen in years and a handful of others can trash it is amazing. What in the heck were they watching? Eddie Murphy should have walked away with a Best Actor award and the movie holds it's own with all of the Best Motion Picture nominees for 2016!"
" Great Movie Left Me Wanting More
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,9,"Wish there were flashbacks of Mr.Church youth, certain scenes dropped hints of a discreet lifestyle but overall I was happy to see Eddie Murphy giving a great performance in a different light!"
" Nice story
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,10,"In my life one of the best best best movie i ever watch. Wonderful story about a good man.
I think i will never ever watch a movie like this in Future .
Really a good movie. I watch many time and i love to watch it again.i love this movie."
" U ever saw i movie so good that you were afraid to finish it
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie sums what il the meaning of a good life, you get so captured by it even there is no bih events or big drama, but the flow makes you wait for the ""end"" knowing what will happen, but in the same time afraid of it.
Just wonderful"
" The greatest🌟🌟🌟 from a long and fruitful career and Mister Murphy still as entertaining as today
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,10,I would have to say I have seen every single Eddie Murphy movie including Shrek even the bad ones it's a critics might have said but I believe this is one of his greatest roles and who knows he has time to even talk this😍
" There is great movies out there!
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,10,".... but you have to work hard to find them. This one never had a premiere in my country, and I had to import the Blu-ray from another region, as the movie was not available anywhere.Mr. Church is a gem of a movie, that has rolled directly in on my top 20. it deserves much praise. Mr. Church has a wonderful story and amazing acting. Eddie Murphy is mindblowingly good in the role as mr. church, and should be nominated for an oscar for this. Fingers crossed that he will pick up many new roles to challenge his acting talent even more.What happens in the movie industry these days? We so much need platforms for all these great movies that (thanks lord!) are still produced. Why this one was not marketed widely is a mystery to me.So many people needs to see this movie of hope, loyalty and love.Bravo! its a must see and a timeless movie, so it will have all chances to surface again from the pile of ""more of the same"" movies that is the movie industry these days."
" Beautiful story about the circle of life.
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,9,"I LOVED this movie. It is a real tear jerker but also a heart warmer. This sweet and inspiring tale of friendship and family was wonderfully told by Charlotte who was beautifully played by Britt Robertson. Eddie Murphy is one of my all time favorite actors and he did not dissapoint in his role as Mr. Church. Things were different in the mid 60's, 70's and early 80's and this movie shows things as they were. The acting was good, the music refreshing and the story was bitter-sweet. I think that anyone who watches this and doesnt enjoy it in its simplicity is looking too hard for reasons to dislike it."
" Unexpectedly awesome
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,9,"I'm a 50 year old man who loves action movies and I reluctantly watched this in bed with my wife today, only because it had Eddie Murphy in it and it was pretty recent - though I don't recall ever seeing any trailers or anything for it.Movies like this usually have some overly emotional moments meant to pull at your heart strings but I was surprised at how unforced those moments seemed while I was watching it.Yes, I teared up several times during the movie but when it was over I didn't feel sad. The actors did their job excellently, I never once felt anyone was actually acting, and that their relationships and feelings were real.I want to believe that people like Mr. Church really exist as the world would be such a better place."
" Great movie!
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,10,"I loved every single minute of this film. Not sure what happened, but the marketing team on this film should be ashamed of themselves. This movie deserved so much more recognition than it received. This is probably Eddies best film in his entire career. Give this movie a look. Even if you dislike everything Eddie ever did, you will really enjoy this little gem."
" Worth Seeing!
",2019-09-16 00:00:00,8,"This is what I always call a small movie, simple with no guns, martial arts, special effects.... A nice story, Murphy's performance was exactly was it was supposed to be; understated and he pulled it off. I saw the bad reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, I do not understand the bad reviews? I think so many simply do not appreciate a good well performed story without all the other garbage we see today. Take some time, sit, relax with a glass of wine and just enjoy the story."
" Wonderful movie.
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,9,Er heard of this movie before Netflix. So glad I found it. It was really wonderful and Eddie Murphy is stellar. Extremely emotional film.
" In This Age
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,9,Kept ignoring this on our NetFlix offerings. Finally saw the trailer. Watched w my wife tonite and loved every minute of this. Eddie Murphy is stupendous in a dramatic role. Britt Robertson is the next Jen Lawrence. Natascha McElhone is radiant and loving like few other actresses. This world needs more heart and love. Mr Church helps w that immensely.
" Incredible story
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,9,"This is a warm and wonderful story,we loved it.The actors were so good in their roles."
" Mr. Church (2016)
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,10,"I GOTTA ADMIT MY MIND WAS BLOWN, NEVER HAVING SEEN EDDIE MURPHY IN A SERIOUS ROLL, IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT I WOULD SAY IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I'VE SEEN !!!!"
" The most heart-warming story of love and loyalty
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,9,"A very different role for Eddie Murphy but a performance truly worth watching. Yes, it appears a bit contrived but great family entertainment.
Britt Robertson and McKenna Grace also provide top-notch dramatic efforts.
Watch this on a Sunday afternoon and make sure you have plenty of tissues."
" Best feel good movie of the year
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,10,"I love Eddie Murphy, and when I saw this on Netflix I knew I had to watch it. What a heartwarming story showing that family can be anything you want it to be. A beautiful and loving story about acceptance and the twists and turns of life. Highly recommended."
" Warm and Beautiful.
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,10,I came across this movie today and I loved every second. Mr. Church was a mystery that umdolded throughout the course of the movie. He was kind and had his faults but he knew how to love and care for others. I kept on crying at certain scenes but I enjoyed the movie so very much. The acting was superb and Eddie Murphy was a joy to see in such a beautiful role.
" Had the film even watched itself?
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,1,"My problem. The white family are almost in a different movie entirely, and the 'mystical black man' trope grounding, enhancing their lives, makes it about them. It's as if his distance serves the wrong lesson. Its powerful racial and spiritual subtext is hinted but ignored in favor of its 'wisdom'. It is a shame because he is so interesting. The sophisticated man compartmentalizes his life into two halves. She reads Tess. He is the male Tess. Its mastery is it goes this entire literature living inside his exterior which frustrates us, searching with her for the puzzle. Then as a cinematic jigsaw puzzle it hints itself across decades, years and years to find different angles of him, to chip away his guard, to learn something at all. Interesting is his viciousness any time she comes close to peering across the other side. The reveal of abuse is our answer and art as the other half, as in, art is not a reaction to trauma but art is trauma itself."
" Murphy deserves Oscar for this movie
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,10,"Strong powerful performance by Eddie in his late 50s giving us a taste of what's coming next in his career.Overall one of these movies so well done that gives you a silly smile even 15 minutes after it ends.A must see for the soul.
TIP:BE HUNGRY AND EAT WHILE WATCHING.Trust me"
" I'm Getting Jaded
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,7,"I must be getting jaded, because I didn't find this film as inspiring or heartwarming or great as many other people did. It's the story of people living their lives. We all have our stories. We all have tragedy and death in our lives, we all have joy. I learned nothing from the movie, I felt nothing I haven't felt in my own life. But I guess people looking for a good cry would enjoy it.I did really, really like one thing about the film, though; Eddie Murphy's performance. It was nice to see him tone it down for once. Plus he showed some acting chops too, able to express emotion with no or few words. I'd like to see more of the same from him.
9 stars for him, 5 stars for a stereotypical script = 7 stars overall."
" Why haven't I seen this Gem before?
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,10,Not since the ending scenes from Bridges of Madison County have I been so emotionally moved by a movie. I hope Eddie Murphy reads these reviews. A lot of rare 10/10 ratings and well deserved. This movie is about a growing young lady who finds decency and character in a cook who becomes part of the family. It's a joy to see her character develop as she grows and becomes a warm and compassionate person. Best movie I have seen in a long time. Eddie Murphy and Britt Robertson deserved awards instead of the usual junk Hollywood puts out.
" ""True vision, my dear.""
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,10,"Just the right amount of payoff, just the right amount of restraint, to bring out the beauty of this mysterious and moving story and these inspired performances. The whole movie was as delicious, nourishing, and wonderful as Mr. Church's cooking. I got so hungry watching it that only a captivating experience could have kept me glued to the screen from start to finish. My favorite Eddie Murphy performance by far, and the entire cast was excellent."
" MADE ME CRY
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely loved this movie. I usually don't get emotional watching movies, but I watched this movie twice and cried."
" Bravo!
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,10,"Brilliant film. Great actors. Perhaps the best film starring Eddie Murphy...
Everything is made very thin and filigree."
" Nothing lacking! I dare to say it's Eddie Murphy's best performance.
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie three times. It's amazing, heartwarming and is, undoubtedly, a tearjerker. It will leave you thinking about life and time spent with love ones. It's an irreplaceable gem.When Mr. Church dies... Man!To the Metacritics, your scores would Rob viewers of this amazing experience."
" EXCELLENT!
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,10,Now I've seen Eddie do some films that I really enjoyed but this right here to me personally topped it off! This is the first time I've seen him do movies like this! I definitely loved the relationship with each individual person in this film I normally don't watch films like this but it's worth watching!
" If hollywood made more like this, everyone would go to the movies.
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie was released in 2016, and here in 2019 my wife, on a whim, suggested watching it on Netflix. I never heard of it, and when she mentioned Eddie Murphy I had the feeling that I would have to sit through childish trash like he used to create. I was wrong. Murphy was spectacular, and the movie is one of the very few new movies that is worth watching. It is actually among the best movies in recent years. A clean, moral movie that relies on talent and a good story instead of peurile sex, violence and effects. I wish Hollywood would return to this kind of real story telling again. Well done."
" Must see is an understatement.
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,10,"I cant believe with an actor as big as Eddie Murphy in it, this movie didn't get more press. It was released in 2016 and it's my first time even hearing about it here In 2019. This movie had me on an emotional roller coaster almost every step of the way. Great cast, great story, great acting. This is must watch and should definitely be in your watch list. Bravo to the cast and crew that put this together."
" Excellent movie!
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,9,Mr Church was a phenomenal film. Eddie Murphy is excellent in this role. I really enjoyed this movie
" It was an in depth personal story
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,6,This story shows how a man that doesn't have a family of his own starts to caretake for someone's mother throughout the movie the main characters start to develop and learn a lot about life and how important this one cook is in this little girls life and that alone can break even a grown man into a fit of tears
" Not from a professional....
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,10,"Reviewing the previous critics, I disagree. I found the movie entertaining and charming. A person fulfilling a promise to assist a dying lady and caring for her and her child. Linking this to servitude detracts from the era of the film, relationships in that time were what they were. And the bonding reflected totally is reflective of what occurs over time."
" Unexpected Pleasure
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,8,"I'd never heard of this movie and happened upon it on network TV. I couldn't get into it the first time I tried to watch it because it wasn't funny. However, I decided to sit through it and give it a fair shot. It was never meant to be a comedy and was actually a good. The acting was performed very well and I actually cried at the end. I'd always enjoyed Eddie Murphy's films, but I forgot he can act well in serious non-comical roles. I definitely recommend this movie because I enjoyed it."
" Eddie Murphy in a Very Different Role Leads The Cast In a Good Drama
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,8,"I was unsure about this film after looking it up on Wikipedia and read that it got quite a disappointing response. But I was very surprised at how heartwarming, well acted and just plain interesting the film was. There is so much subtext to this film, especially if you lived through this period. The film takes us on a journey that touches upon so many controversial mores of the time, yet tells a story that doesn't politicize, dramatize or grinds any agendas really. How wonderful it was to just sit back and enjoy a walk through the lives of three generations portrayed excellently by all the actors."
" Tear Jerker
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,10,"Outstanding performances by Murphy, McElhone and the Charlie characters at all ages. A love story as well as social struggles."
" Caution: may leave a permanent tattoo on your psyche

" Eddie Murphy's tour deforce
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,9,"How perverse we Americans have become.This movie belongs on the best movie of the year nomination, at least."
" Miss Charlie WasToo Much
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,7,"Eddie Murphy delivered the subtle pathos that we saw peek out of his sketches way back during his SNL days The story was a sweet example of how we sometimes have to make our own families where we find them and Mr. Church's kindness was touching throughout.But Charlie? Spoiled, rude, snotty little Charlie? My hand itched to slap her during all her early scenes. Sure she was a little upset to find a stranger in her kitchen and it's realistic that it might take a few days for a child to accept someone new in her small world, but hadn't her mother taught her anything about respect for adults? Good manners? Everyday niceness? Her whole spoiled attitude went on way too long and once she was grown up I still wanted to shake her. How could she possibly believe that Mr. Church saved enough money by using grocery store coupons to put Charlie through college?Finally, after inviting herself into his home, she breaks his one and only rule and goes snooping through his bedroom drawers! Her behavior was inexcusable through most of the movie, she even had to have Mr. Church tell her to forgive her damaged friend for being materialistic. What were Charlie's redeeming qualities? I saw none.Still, well worth watching, for Eddie Murphy's acting and his memorable character."
" Sweet and authentic
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Mr. Church is sweet and authentic from the first word to the last. It is well-paced and devoid of drag with steller performances turned out by all players. Mr. Church demonstrates that while we may be on a linear path from birth to death, within that trajectory are full circle loops taking us from one gestalt to the next. It reminds us too how we make a difference in the lives of others and they in ours. Mr. Church was Eddy Murphy's movie to deliver and that he did. Unlike books which are meant to be read from beggining to end, sometimes the stories are better understood when we start from the end and work our way back."
" Terrific Movie
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,9,"I found this movie accidentally on Netflix. First I love Eddie Murphy most of the time and this was no exception. I am dumbfounded that I never heard about it. My favorite movie genre is ""based on a true story"" even if license is taken. This is a marvelous story and the acting is top notch. The script is well done, with just the right amount of mystery. Despite the desperately sad moments, it doesn't milk them.I strongly recommend this movie to anyone with a bit of heart."
" Critics Don't Know! Pretty good movie.
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,7,"Mr Church is a well constructed movie that does a good job allowing you to understand the characters in throughout different time periods. I think Murphy does a great job with his character. Don't necessarily like how Brit's character was written up. The character could have shown more heart. Otherwise, great movie to watch."
" Nice Afternoon Movie...****Spoiler****Mr. Church's Secret Revealed
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,7,"Nice movie to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Some people express surprise at Eddie's acting, but he proved it could act in ""Dream Girls"". So no surprise there. Wholly, utterly predictable, but still a nice little movie.
***spoiler below****His secret is he was gay. Little hints dropped along the way: When he's drunk, he's yellng about not being a ""faggot"". (Wherever he drinks he argues with his dad, a religious man who rejected his son {picture at the end scene} and relives the rejection.) And when he talks about an early, long ago marriage, he says, I married her because my dad wanted me to.Mystery solved.Afterall, this is the sixties and seventies, people were not out of the closet (this is California, but not the bay area). Also, compartmentalized his life (Jelly didn't know he could cook)."

Every actor and actress in this film deserve every award imaginable-there was absolutely nothing cheesy about any performance, ESPECIALLY Murphy's! He shows a depth of character we haven't seen from him in a while, but was exceptional! I'd give it a 12/10 if I could!"
" Loved it!

",2019-01-04 00:00:00,10,Grew up watching and loving Eddie Murphy from Saturday night live through all his comedies. He is truly amazing in this film. Apparently his range is l8mitless. Great story that will wet your eyes and now my favorite E.M. ever.
" a simple feel good movie
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,10,"I JUST happened to stumble on this on netflix.I agree with all the positive reviews, when I saw such a small gross for the movie I can understand.The studio just ignored any publicity for it.what a great cast.eddie was amazing in carrying the lead,and all the cast especially older charlie were so on point! it is so true,they don't make movies like this anymore and what a shame. No CGI, f bombs, and a real plot with articulate conversations. Too bad hardly anyone has heard of this movie."
" Beautiful heartwarming and genuineness
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,9,"Mr Church is a very loving heartwarming movie. It teaches about being yourself, being genuine and loving in your own terms without expectations. It is also about friendship and respect and ..... Don't expect a lot, just watch it to warm yourself up."
" Outstanding in every way
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,10,"By the grace of Netflix, I watched ""Mr. Church"" today, having never before heard of the film. What a surprise to discover an absolute gem of a picture! The story, the script, the acting, the unfolding of the plot...all of it is simply marvelous. Many, if not most, films that touch the heart become predictable somewhere along the way, but not ""Mr. Church."" Just when you think you know what is going to happen, you get a surprise. But there's no Deus ex machina here. Everything happens naturally, and the whole story just feels like life, just a little bit better! A crime that ""Mr. Church"" was not widely publicized enough to draw in audiences; it surely would have been an award-winner if it had been promoted at all. I will be recommending it to my friends and family as an absolute must-see. Run, do not walk, to your TV, get on Netflix, and watch ""Mr. Church!"""
" This movie broke my heart, but in a good way.

BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO!!!!!!
" Wonderful film
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Eddie Murphy gives a possible Academy Award performance. IMDB quote: ""Mr. Church"" tells the story of a unique friendship that develops when a little girl and her dying mother retain the services of a talented cook - Henry Joseph Church. What begins as a six month arrangement instead spans into fifteen years and creates a family bond that lasts forever.""Beautiful film, sometimes heart wrenching but uplifting film on so many levels and worthy of viewing."
" Quiet and Lovely
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,9,"Stumbled upon this movie on Netflix. Surprised and disappointed to not have heard of it before now. Very well acted, beautifully paced and touching story. Bravo, Mr. Murphy and the entire cast."
" Maybe I Should Learn to Cook
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,10,"One of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Knowing Eddie Murphy as Donkey from Shrek gave me a few -later proved incorrect- negative ideas about the movie. Watching the relationship between Charlie and Mr. Church grow throughout the movie is one of the most heartwarming things you can see, and more importantly, feel. Everyone should have someone like Mr. Church in their life, not necessarily as a cook, but maybe as a teacher, father, brother, or uncle. Bottom line, the $700k made in the box office far undermines the complete and utter praise this movie deserves."
" Don't sleep on this film, Underestimated !
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,8,"This is a heart-warming drama film, that really captures and centers what matters most in life (at least in this plot). It received negative reviews from critics but it's well done don't go by the critics on this one. This is worth watching!"
" Really Bad, but Had So Much Potential
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,5,"First, in defense of Murphy's character. Critics say he was like a slave, and others say he was too unemotional, so we couldn't see what he got out of the relationships. But I have a different theory. Perhaps he had a strong work ethic and great loyalty to the man he used to work for.
He had a whole previous life with the man who was paying for his services. Cooking for this woman and child was a paying position, and a dying wish of his employer. So maybe he took the job very seriously, thus keeping a certain professional distance. Just like a butler might.Whenever possible, please avoid narration, directors! Especially from kids. It's so unnatural. Why make a movie, if the audience needs to have the story read to them? Actors are paid to convey a story via acting.Everything was so predictable. It fit a wish-list of coincidences that bring feel-good resolve.Having said all that, the basic concept of people being supportive of one another, despite their own personal troubles is a fine one to explore. As is the notion of an ""unconventional"" family.
I'm ok with leaving most aspects of Mr. Church's past unexplained. It's nice to have a character who displays dignity without knowing every detail of what defines him. That way we can simply appreciate the dignity.
But if the person has as many talents as this one does, we need a little more exploration. Even one good conversation explaining why he chose to cook for a living.
I don't think race really mattered here. The character could have been any race. If he was gay, then perhaps that would explain a certain nurturing quality that one might not expect in a straight male. So maybe his devotion to these women was not because of some stereotypical racial quality, but rather something related to his orientation. The film was set during a time period when openness about that stuff was not as casual as it would be now.
But like others have said, we did need more character development with the mother and the daughter. Does the mom have any guilt about an adulterous lifestyle? Who was the father of the kid? Do they have any patriotism or religion? What is the source of their values? Aren't there any grandparents?
Murphy didn't have to do much. Just keep quiet and gave at people thoughtfully, and once in a while act drunk in the background. Easy paycheck.
Are we sure that a woman whose only boyfriend was a rich married guy, and who lives in a depressed neighborhood as a single mother, would be so clean and sweet all the time?
I realize that she wanted to live long for her daughter, but wouldn't a dying person get depressed or cynical sometimes? The woman is a saint at all times. That seems unrealistic, since we are not told any reason why she would be that way.
Bottom line: Nice feel-good concept and moments, but way too much unexplored potential and predictable clichés."
" This is a must watch!
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,9,"I don't know how this this wonderful masterpiece slipped by me back in 2016 or why it wasn't more widely known, but am so glad I ran across it by accident.
The story of love, loss, growing up, death, dying, and how we touch other peoples lives is inspirational.
Watch it and you'll be better off for doing so."
" Lame writing
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,1,There should be a new rating: 'C' for chick flick and another; 'L' for lame. The only thing worth watching was Eddy Murphy's acting which is very good in this film. As you watch the rest of it you can imagine the actors reading from the script. Poor writing results in poor acting for the most part. How Eddy Murphy's character managed to seem natural with such predictable lines is beyond me.
" Beautiful
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,10,"It took me forever to finally watch this movie. I'm am so glad I did. It was beautiful. It's my new favorite. Do yourself a favor and watch this one. The acting, sets, story...all wonderful."
" Excellent Movie
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,10,"I wanted to see an action movie but my request was vetoed by my wife and girls.

" What a Great Movie
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,10,"I wanted to see an action movie but this was a welcome rebuttal from my wife and kids. Very happy I saw this and racism is not the main idea here which is kinda refreshing.
Just a sweet movie."
" Don't let the name Mr. Church fool you. Great Movie.
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,10,"I loved it, having experienced abandonment and loss. Hits home. Eddie Murphy was great as well as all other cast members."
" ""He was like the moon - cool, calm, and always there.""
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,7,"My best takeaway from the film is that it's not only possible, but probably occurs more often than one usually would consider, that a healthy relationship along biracial lines can exist on the order of ""Mr. Church"". Having mentioned that though, I did find it odd that through all the circumstances that Mr. Church (Eddie Murphy) and the Brooks's were engaged in, no one came across with a snide remark or was derisive in any way. Especially when Charlie (Britt Robertson) wound up living with him during and after her pregnancy. It seemed like pains were taken by the filmmakers to specifically avoid racial situations that could have blown up due to intolerance or simple ignorance.What bothered me had to do with the intense secrecy that Mr. Church demanded regarding his personal life. The fact of an unhappy childhood due to a father's verbal and physical abuse didn't sound like something that someone like Marie (Natascha McElhone) or Charlie wouldn't have been able to process. In fact, a heart to heart conversation between the parties might have led to an even deeper understanding between them. Mr. Church appeared to be exceptionally well disciplined in matters of personal decorum around the Brooks home, making it that much more unlikely for him to spend two nights a week getting wasted at Jelly's. So that entire dynamic didn't seem credible to me as the story progressed.As a feel good movie, the movie hits a lot of the right marks and is well recommended for family fare. Yet situations like Charlie's pregnancy and Mr. Church's wild tantrums when people get too close to him negate some of the positive vibe that the picture strives for. It was fascinating however to see a different side to Eddie Murphy's acting range. It wouldn't have hurt though, to see him crack a smile every now and then."
" Lovely movie
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,10,"I liked it very much!

" Mr Church goes apostate
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,5,"This was a ""nice"" film in the order of Lifetime movies. It was sweet AND touching, but extremely predictable. Eddie Murphy is a great actor, but he was truly 1 dimensional in a pretty stereotypical role.
There are better movies that have grabbed for this brass ring of the heart.
Mr Church got hold of tin."
" A story of saving lives.
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,8,"A story of saving lives. A dying mother and her child, the child, the drunk at the verge of suicide, the child's child and finally Mr. Church. The child may have very well become a novelist like she always wanted thanks to Mr. Church's death ; the life he gave to her. A beautiful story. Weaved together with intelligence and craft to create a story fueled by love, jazz and cooking. Stunning performances, with a shaky start and progressive story, the movie builds upon itself very well. The beauty of sacrifice is felt in every detail."
" Uplifting!
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,10,"What do professional critics know? Nothing about good writing or cinema it seems. This movie kept me interested from minute 1 to the very end. Murphy was stunning. That simple. The story itself doesn't get twisted and contorted with flashbacks and riddles. It's unusual, which may bother some critics but it feels real. Sans violence, blood, overdrawn drama , it speaks to a human heart in a tender natural way. An absolute must see movie. Now, Rotten Tomatoes and Meta Critic, maybe someday you will be lucky, like the Grinch. Think about it."
" Fantastic Work by Eddie Murphy in Moving Film
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,9,This is far & away the best work Murphy has done in many years. Wonderful story. Great to see Bruce Beresford directing again. All of the girls & women playing Charlie are very good. Don't miss this one & then tell your friends.
" A superb movie!
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,8,"It's a little bit of a weepy mixed with a bit of a feel-good movie but the script by Susan McMartin is excellent and the whole thing is superbly directed and edited.The storyline has a very few question marks in it (which comes of watching too many movies!) but just go with the flow and appreciate the whole.Eddie Murphy plays heavily against type although he's not required to play a vast range. My biggest criticism - and you may see how niggly this may be - is when he says ""my dear"" which he uses a lot and which really doesn't fit him at all. It may suit the character but it's a phrase he just doesn't deliver well and it pulls me right out of the story.Yeah, well, maybe that's just me.See, niggle, niggle ,niggle.But this is one of the more intelligent, emotional movies of recent years and well worth your time watching."
" A challenge
",2018-05-10 00:00:00,9,"Oh, I discovered that I can produce manly tears too. And I did so for about an hour, during this movie. Very recommended."
" An Unexpected Gem
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,8,"I watched this film only because it was part of my Amazon Prime membership and I was blown away. Eddie Murphy offers a performance that is so unexpected, so genuine, I forgot he was the same comedian/actor who made such disappointments like ""Norbit."" If you need a good chick-flick or want a good cry, grab your Kleenex and watch ""Mr. Church."""
" A different side to Eddie Murphy
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,5,"From a childhood growing up with a new Eddie Murphy movie almost every year, to an adulthood where it now seems like a rarity to hear about the comedy kingpin, let alone see him in a movie, Mr. Church is the 80's and 90's staple newest film and first to release since 2012, allowing us the opportunity to once more see Murphy on our screens.Those wishing to see old-school Murphy will be left sorely disappointed however as Mr. Church is Murphy at his most refined and low-key, perhaps the most he ever has been, as the wisecracking master dials it right down to portray real-life figure Henry Church in Bruce Beresford's dramatization of screenwriter Susan McMartin's upbringing with her kindly and good natured chef/father figure Mr. Church.Well adverse to feel good tales from his direction of films such as Driving Miss Daisy, Tender Mercies and Evelyn, Australian director Beresford dials up the kitsch to 11 in this feel good drama and it's not hard to see why Mr. Church was almost unanimously panned by critics upon its curiously low-key release a few years back, but despite the film feeling rather manipulative and often too convenient in its overcoming's of heavy life events, there's a gentle feel good quality to this tale that is led by Murphy in what's arguably his most assured acting turn outside of his comedy hijinks.Walking that fine line between fairy-tale like guardian figure whose all too happy to be cooking and housekeeping for some white picket fence American's and a layered figure whose mysterious past and life experiences has led him to become the man as we see him, Murphy is Mr. Church's MVP and it's a performance that showcases just what might lay in store for his acting future as he reaches an age where characters like Axel Foley and Sherman Klump are no longer possibilities.It's a shame Beresford's rather uninspired direction and Mr. Church's other acting ensemble don't come to the party as Britt Robertson, who doubles up as our key figure Charlie and the films narrator, fails to make Charlie completely work as a character, while the intriguing but never fully resolved back story surrounding Henry Church never unlocks the way we hope it does making our emotional investment in the characters plight lesser than it could've easily been.While nice not to be spoon-fed everything we expect, Mr. Church's inability to maximise the power of its story frustrates more than it should.Final Say - Mr. Church is the type of film that'll make you feel good, even though you know you've been manipulated into feeling so and while it's a slight piece of cinematic fluff, it's particularly refreshing to see a side of Murphy we've seen very little of in a career built around outlandish turns and his performance here makes Mr. Church a passable middle of the road experience.2 ½ boxes of matches out of 5"

" Pleasant Surprise
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Didn't get it just dues. Modeled after ""Driving Miss Daisy"" without the humor which was surprising considering Mr. Comedy/Eddie Murphy is in it. Highly recommend watching with an open-mind and maybe a tissue or two."
" Eddie Murphy's finest work in years
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,8,"Pleasantly surprising and good. It's obvious what you're getting into before seeing Mr. Church. A black man becomes a prominent figure in a white family. What the writers and actors do from there decides how the audience will react. They nailed it. There's so much depth to the two main characters. In the end you love them both. This movie did everything set out to do, except probably make more money at the box office."
" A fine movie with murhphy as its heart and soul
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,7,"I usually write those reviews for ""extreme"" reasons. If everybody hated a movie and I didn't. Or the other way round. Turns out there is another reason. When an actor who was once a star ""comes back"" with a stellar performance. Mr. Church is that film.Murphy delivers a heart wearming performance. He is the soul of the movie. I guess we will never know why Murphy so rarely appears on the screen but If you watch him here you can't help yourself wanting to see him more often.Don't get me wrong. This movie has problems and it is corny, sometimes a bit too much. But it is a film for families about families and a heartwarming one at that. Thats why it surely is no 10 rating but also no 4, 3, 2 or even 1 rating. If you want something for the family, if you like films like Forrest Gump and if you like Murphy, this is your movie.One thing I wanted to say when I read the official critics. They complain about an Afro-American being the servant. If you think that, you clearly didn't get the movie at all. He is basically father, husband. grandfather in one person. So if you saw him as a servant, you should really think about what that says about you."
" Calm, Humble and Warm
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)Eddie Murphy in a pure drama without comedy! I did a quick scan through his filmography and I don't think he has ever done anything without some dose of comedy in it. And he did a really good job with it. Murphy plays a cook, Mr. Church, who is hired to make meals by her ex- husband or some man she was very close to for a dying mother and her daughter. The mother is given six months to live and if Mr. Church cooks for those six months he'll receive a handsome sum of money. (slight spoiler) Well, the mother lives for another 6-7 years and Mr. Church keeps on cooking and has formed a bond with the mother and daughter yet he has a rule that he won't share any details about his personal life that goes on after dinner is over with. Is he hiding anything? How can he be so close yet still so far? The story unfolds over several years and their relationships have small tests now and then but no significant drama. The acting is very good and subtle, nice production value with passable cinematography but I'd say it was more fascinating to see Murphy act seriously than I found interest with the story. It was pleasant and not super original yet there was a secondary plot point about just living a good and humble existence without the need for material possessions."
" Best Heartfelt Movie in a very long time
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,10,"Best heartfelt movie I have seen in a long time. Hollywood finally got it right. This is the kind of movie that hardworking people want to see. Not the trash at theater's now days. Great messages, one will experience all feelings and, yes, people can be friends. Eddie Murphy is excellent in this role."
" Who wouldn't want a cook?
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,10,"Marie Brooke (Natascha McElhone) had an affair with Richard, a wealthy married man. Upon his death he gave his cook, Mr. Church (Eddie Murphy) a stipend to take of Marie and her child Charlie (Natalie Coughlin/Britt Robertson) as Marie was dying from breast cancer in 1971 LA. Mr. Church has a private life he prefers not to share as the film jumps to 1977.This is a simple heart warming film which incorporates the best in all of us, emphasizing a forgiving and loving nature. Love touches everyone's life in positive ways. If you want to watch a film with heart, character, but not much action or high tension drama, this one was well performed. Should get a nomination.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity"
" A ""Rare Jewel"" of a movie depicting the commitment, cost and joy of Love.
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,10,"In this day and age that is saturated with discord and violence; this movie renews the hope of those who, in spite of their own failings, choose the sacrifice of Love over more selfish survival. I am thankful that movies like this still exist to show us and our children the choice of a ""better way"" in Life/Living.

" Why wasn't this film publicized?
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,9,"Yes, it is a tear jerker. So what? In fact i haven't seen an 11 Kleenex movie in a decade until this one, which i discovered on Amazon Prime. This movie is about family. We all know by now, 'tho some of us don't accept, apparently, that a family can be any combination of sexes, races, ages and what have you. Family is a group that supports and loves you, takes care of you when you need care and has fun with you when fun is possible. The acting in this movie is subtle and honest. Eddie Murphy, like Robin Williams, is a comedian who can also be a disciplined actor given a wonderful director like Bruce Beresford and a good script. Kudus to all the cast and crew. I'm only rating it a 9 because some folks think tear jerkers can't be good movies. I do, but the 9 is a slight warning to those unenlightened ones."

",2017-08-10 00:00:00,8,"Eddie gets so close to the comfort zone.Huge respect Mr. Murphy , you are so close! this is a very engaging drama- the heaviness between the players is very well written. Great work ""writer'! Where it drops is the accents for the times. And how underprivileged, talked to, no offense ""white people"".I worked for the US government as a temp, My boss was not ""white"" I had huge respect for that man, but since he went to collage in the days of oppression, I felt a sense of fear, which I never endused.The Director missed this!Sadly I still see this today with older people that lived in that time."
" why all the good ratings
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,4,"Yes, I totally agree that this was somehow a sweet family movie, heartwarming at times, nice to watch if you have nothing better to do, but I can't over the fact that it was absolutely unrealistic. I was reading the reviews hoping that someone would share my opinion. Usually, I am shocked by the negative reviews on movies I truly like, that possess depth & likable characters, but this one had mostly perfect ratings and I cannot not ask: Why? There were so many things that did not make any sense at all: the biggest reveal was that Mr. Church played the piano? Why did he come home drunk every night? Like he wasn't out partying, he was playing the piano, right? I got it, there was some daddy drama, but things just didn't seem convincing to me! And Charlie just went to live with him after he had been trying for so long to hide every information about his personal life? She went to spend her holiday there for a few days and she ended up staying there a few years??? She even moved there with her daughter, which leads me to: a daughter?! Just because her mother got pregnant, that doesn't make it very plausible for her to get pregnant and be totally okay with it. This movie seemed really exaggerated and it even made me feel uncomfortable at times."
" Time Well Spent
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,8,"A film about everyday human beings relating to one another in extraordinary ways. It's quite refreshing to find filmmakers willing to make movies like Mr. Church during an era in which they are quickly lost among the sea of big-budget, CGI Action Adventure, Sci-Fi and Comic Hero flicks.If rated on the merits of Mr. Murphy's considerable talents alone. This movie rates a solid ten. Eddie Murphy subtly imbues the character with a dignity and grace that would be over-played by others. I have long believed that Eddie Murphy's skill as an actor is a largely untapped resource. This film begins to scratch the surface of his capabilities. Additionally, Natascha McElhone delivers a beautifully-nuanced performance as Marie. The remainder of the cast are, while not exceptional, solid in their roles.The film is occasionally overtly sentimental and more than once drifts dangerously close to ""After-School Special"" territory as it did in both a hospital and wedding scene that attempt to force an emotional reaction from the viewer, responses that otherwise come naturally as the story progresses. I am surprised, though perhaps I shouldn't be in today's cynical world, at the many negative reviews this film received. It is competently scripted, well-paced with characters who are relatable, likable and portrayed by a solid cast. Avoid the tendency to look for some deeper societal meaning as some critics have. Focus instead on what the film sets out to accomplish, the telling of a story about the humanity at its best and the resulting triumph of love and friendship. It seems like that is a story that needs to be told and told well in today's angry world. Mr. Church accomplishes both."
" 10 Stars Are Not Enough
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,10,"I am not very familiar with most of Mr. Murphy's work, so I don't know a lot about what he's done. However, I do know this ... very few actors can inhabit a character as Mr. Murphy did. There was no Eddy Murphy in this movie; there was only Mr. Church, fully embodied and precisely nuanced and so true-to-life that you expect to find him in the kitchen the next morning ... which, since this is a true story, is entirely fitting. Well done, Mr. Murphy. Well done."
" Eddie, you deserved better
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,3,"It looked like a sure thing. ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in the 70's and 80's in California. Eddie Murphy must have jumped at the chance to be part of what seemed like surefire Oscar-bait. And the acting is not bad. Eddie Murphy is the clear standout, although he doesn't have much to work with. Natasha McElhone really classes up the first third of the movie (as you may know from the preview, she doesn't last too long). Even Britt Robertson is fun to watch, although her character is one of passivity - things happen for her and to her, there is not much that she takes an active role in. She explains in the film that after her mother was gone, she ""lost her way"" but it's never clear she has much of a way to begin with. Plenty of interesting characters with potential. The real problem is the writing. None of the people that we meet are fleshed out fully and are end up tropes of people we've seen before. Dying Cancer Mom. Independent Daughter Who Never Knew She Needed a Dad. ""Magical Negro."" Mr. Church's life and motivations are a mystery, never even fully resolved at the end of the film - why? The film hints toward the beginning about some great reveal as to why Mr. Church has come to live with Marie and Charlie, but there is never any satisfying payoff. The narration from Robertson's character is annoying to the point of distraction at points in the film, bless her for not laughing her way through hackneyed narrative like ""my mother was the sun, Mr. Church was the moon..."" Most everything is predictable and telegraphed, or sometimes plot points are telegraphed with little resolution. Mr. Church goes to that ""naughty"" jazz club twice a week and also somehow plays a mean jazz piano...OMG, what to make of that? Sounds like an important life choice to keep secret from the only people in your life!This smacked of an important story about a non-traditional family, but ended up being a glurgy mess."
" Simple, End to Beginning.
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,7,"I am a fan really, of films that pursue such heartwarming simplicity. Mr Church isn't about a budget, it's not about a twist, it is quite simply, about a journey.Only problems I have with this particular film, is perhaps its editing, and certain jumps it had in the story, however, that all is somewhat ineffectual in comparison to the actual, tale.Natascha McElhone was absolutely great, Britt Robertson was also wonderful to watch and Eddie Murphy was simply, lovely.Something about Mr Church feels like it's based on true events, which of course means, perhaps he was a servant, working for the ""White Man"". Be that as it may, the story that was told, the excerpt that was extracted from his life, was moving... And it makes his life story, an encouraging legacy. A simple, 7/10."
" Please watch this and Eddie Murphy where have you been
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,9,"Hollywood doesn't make many of these types of movies. There is no action, bombs, on-screen sex, or much cussing. This is a movie that resets and defines some of the more important things in daily living, namely, friendships and not letting the small things in life that go abrupt define who you are. Mr. Church (Eddie Murphy where have you been and why don't you make more movies) knocks this one out of the park. He stars as the cook sent by a rich philanthropist to his concubine who is dying from breast cancer. That is stated in the first 5 minutes so no spoilers there. What transpires is the growth and development of the characters he becomes involved with. He can be a complex man but deep down there is not a man alive who is as solid as him. You will cry, laugh, cry, and leave this movie with a feeling that there is hope in Hollywood again. I watched it on a subscription service but will buy my own copy to lend to others. This movie needs to be seen by all."
" Truly Amazing!
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,9,"I didn't have much hope for this film after seeing the trailer but I was proved wrong.Such a splendid movie, I don't know people don't like it.The message is pure and simple.Eddie Murphy delivers a great performance.This film really deserves more than what it is being labeled as.It is one of those movies which can be easily overlooked but after you've seen it, it really leaves you amazed.The story is heart-warming and the acting is wonderful.It shows how life is dull with friendship and compassion.Money doesn't really bring joy in our lives and relations,although not of blood,are still cherished."
" Pretty damn good movie.
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't expecting much from Eddie Murphy, to tell you the truth. He's always over the top. But this time he hit a home run. He was subtle and truthful throughout the entire picture. This isn't a ""kid flick,"" it doesn't have any sex or special effects. It's a small film, and slowly paced. But is is well worth the journey, revealing hidden truths that never fail to inspire the heart."
" Friendship & Food
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,8,"Eddie Murphy delves in drama and surprisingly it goes well. Mr. Church is a true life story that tells the tale of relationships, food, and finding family where you least expect it. The story never fully explains some things, but maybe it's better that way. In the Mr. Church retains some mystery."
" Eddie Murphy's ""The Wrestler""
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,10,"Mr. Church is Eddie Murphy's ""The Wrestler."" After appearing in so many crappy family comedies, Eddie Murphy gambled his slipping career by challenging his acting abilities the moment he accepted the serious role in this underrated gem, and it paid off. I grew up watching Murphy's stand up acts, SNL skits, and blockbuster hits, like Beverly Hills Cop, but this film illustrates a change. Perhaps not with sales, but in his development as a person and an actor. As much as I like to laugh at Murphy's one liners in his comedic roles, that is the past. The 80s, Murphy's heyday, are gone. The 90s, when he started slipping are also gone. Don't even get me started on the first decade of the new millennium. The future is now and I sincerely hope Eddie Murphy continues to accept more serious roles, like he did with Mr. Church. He has potential.R.I.P. Charlie. Loved your stories on the Chappelle's Show. If you are where I think you should be, then you I hope you're getting a basketball rematch with Prince."
" Quite a surprise
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Saw this as a recommendation by a friend, who has similar tastes as I. What a pleasant surprise. Nice story, good acting and heart wrenching. I wasn't sure what to expect especially since Eddie Murphy(not known for dramatic roles) was in it. Story of love, friendship, forgiveness and family that doesn't always mean blood. I was pleased with the little twists and turns and how the characters all grow up. I would say if you can see this little gem that surely got missed last year."
" Bravo, Eddie Murphy
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,8,"Eddie Murphy scores excellent across the board for his role as Mr. Church, a self-educated cook who enters the lives of a dying single mother (Natascha McElone) and her well educated, well bred daughter, Charlie, (Britt Robertson) following the wishes of his deceased employer who was also Marie's lover. The three become one happy family living with dignity and bearing, an arrangement Mr. Church said began as innocently as a lady bug flying into someone's house through an open door. Eddie Murphy's performance is a much needed catharsis from the anguish felt for his role as has been James Early (Dreamgirls) who also fought alcoholic demons."
" Sucha lovely movie
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,10,This is one of those movies that i'd recommend everyone to watch it. With all the simplicity this movie shows the effects that someone can have on our lives and how some people can leave such traces on one's life. Such an amazing movie. The dynamics between two characters (Charlotte and Mr. Church) is quite interesting. The way they accept each other just the way they are. Without any judgments or anything is one of the things i like in this movie.
" Magnificent in EVERY way!
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,10,"Why didn't Eddie Murphy get a nomination or win an Oscar for this performance? Good night - I never even heard of this movie. I just happen to see it while surfing Amazon PRIME of all things. I would have paid to see this. It's real life. Get your popcorn, your loved ones, prop your feet up and WATCH THIS. Go Eddie!!!! His costars are spectacular as well."
" Eddie Murphy at his best
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,10,"You would think this script was written just to show what an amazingly talented actor Eddie Murphy is. I have to say more, just to get to the five required lines, so it is fitting to say that part of the display of talent Murphy gives us in this movie is how much depth of emotion he can convey with very few lines and a very reserved character. This really is his best work."
" Good watch
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,10,"I rarely write reviews but due to the poor critic reviews that are associated with this film, I felt a need to add my two cents worth. I went into watching this film with low expectations but found myself not only pleasantly pleased but sorry that it did not get the credit it deserved for being a well told story with much more depth than was given it's due."
" A Must See!!
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,10,"This was a beautifully written, acted and designed movie. I loved it from beginning to end. The characters and relationships were flawed and real and lovable. Eddie Murphy should've won an academy award for Dreamgirls. This is another example of his enormous talent. I truly hope he's being recognized for this role."
" Something, somewhere went horribly wrong...
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,3,"Eddie Murphy is one of my favorite comedians, actors, and for what he did for the late, great Red Fox, makes Mr. Murphy rate in the top 100 finest human beings list, that I keep. This movie did not do any justice to Eddie Murphy's skills as an actor. One bad movie can break a Hollywood career. Thank Creator, Mr. Murphy is an established artists because it is my opinion, if Mr. Murphy had not been an established artist, this movie would have tanked his career.I give Mr. Murphy a 10 star for his performance. The acting, and I mean, for all the actors, the acting was not half bad. The narration completely annoyed me. I give this movie three stars, not because I enjoyed the simple plot and non~mysterious story. I could've completely enjoyed this simple movie. The only redeeming qualities for this film, for me, is the costuming, the make up, the set, and occasionally the lighting, oh, and the skills of the actors and actress'. The director needs to either follow his instincts more or not follow his instincts at all. Perhaps, the director just needs more experience. Listening to the test audience feedback is crucial. What director doesn't want their film to be successful? The test audience is a large part of the film's success. I don't know who the test audience was or who chose the test audience for this movie, maybe that is where everything fell apart for this film. Here I am, trying to figure out why the film flopped. I do this only for the love of Eddie Murphy. Bottom line is, the film is a flop and the director needs to take some lessons in class or on the job training. I don't care which. If the producers restricted the directors instincts and desires for the movie's direction and final finishing touches, shame on the producers. Somewhere, something, went horribly wrong and the final product was just a baaaad movie. It was as if it was directed and produced by children.It wasn't even the simple story line that bothered me. I am capable of enjoying a movie for it's entertainment value alone and ignoring deep flaws. But the narrating, UGH!! The narration destroyed this movie for me.I struggled sitting through this movie to the end. I kept waiting for some surprising monologue, scene, twist in the plot, and it never came. I felt totally cheated at the movie's end. Mr. Murphy, you are a fine man and this terrible movie takes no amount of respect from me that I hold for you. I will continue to view your work.I struggled to give this movie three stars. I enjoyed the children actors, great job boys and girls. I enjoyed the costuming, the make up, but the lighting seemed under-utilized. I will give the director once more chance as everyone makes mistakes in life. But we are talking about my hard earned money here. We all know, movie viewing is no longer cheap. Only one chance though, that's it.For what it's worth, it is my opinion, this movie is a box office BOMB! Terrible, just awful. This movie is as bad as my grammar. I do not recommend it at all."
" Sometimes small tales have hidden depth
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,10,"Mr Church is a film about kindness, which is something you don't often see. It's also about choosing hope over despair. Despite their bumpy lives, Mr Church and the ladies in his life make the best of their ups and downs, all whilst they embrace the aesthetics of life, food, family, music, literature, gardening.In the 1970's an unwed mother finds herself dying form cancer, as an act of charity one of her former lovers provides her with a cook to care for her in her last days. Mr Church over many ups and downs becomes part of the family, and finds something he thought he had lost.This is a delightful little film about the importance of small things, and the weathering of big storms."
" You'll want to like this even though it isn't a wholly convincing or well made film
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,6,"Mr. ChurchA sweet sweet movie. Too sweet, some will say. But never mind the contrived plot or the sometimes worn out dialog—the basic premise and the way it gets told is a warm and welcome escape.Foremost must be the casting of uber comedian Eddie Murphy. Wikipedia says this was the lowest budget movie of his career, but it's not from leaving him to a few key scenes. He dominates the movie as the cook and then caretaker of a mom and her daughter. The mystery of why he would agree to an open ended job like this (see the film) is a strain, but once you just accept that it's happening, the love and tenderness shown in all directions is what you want and what you get.So watch this to feel good. It's not so saccharine that you'll blanch. But be warned that it has lots of little holes (like the old radio that plays jazz, all the time, never news or commercials or whatnot). It has too much solidity, and warmth, to just dismiss for its made-for-TV qualities."
" Eddie Murphy deserves a much better film than this, to show off his underused talent.
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,6,"'MR. CHURCH': Three Stars (Out of Five)The new drama starring Eddie Murphy as a family's cook, that bonds with the young woman he's helping take care of. The movie also stars Britt Robertson and Natascha McElhone. It was directed by Bruce Beresford, who also directed the 1989 Oscar winner 'DRIVING MISS DAISY' (also about a beloved black man helping white people), and it was written by Susan McMartin (who also co-wrote the 1993 Pauly Shore vehicle 'SON IN LAW'). The film has received mostly negative reviews from critics, but Murphy's performance has been mostly praised. I found it to be a mildly enjoyable movie, but it's definitely nothing memorable. The story begins in the 1970s, when Charlie Brooks (Robertson) is just a young girl (Natalie Coughlin). She lives with her single mother, Marie (McElhone), in a small apartment, and she's surprised to find a strange man, named Henry Joseph Church (Murphy), cooking in their kitchen one morning. Charlie later learns that Mr. Church was hired by her mom's ex-lover, to take care of the two of them (and specifically cook for them). She also later learns that her mother is sick with terminal cancer. Charlie forms a very strong relationship with Mr. Church, that lasts many years after her mother's passing. The movie is overly sentimental, and quite cheesy at times, but Murphy is great in it. I think the character of Mr. Church could have been a classic character too, in a much better film than this. The movie looks, and feels, like it could have been an Oscar contender, before you actually sit down and watch it. It's a shame because Murphy deserves a much better film than this, to show off his underused talent.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc"
" Must see!
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie of great thought. It is everything you would and would not expect. Eddie Murphy is excellent! Its beautiful, sad, and inspiring. Grab your family, friends and have a movie night. You will not regret it. I give it a huge two thumbs up and more.I am so relieved to finally see humanitarian movie. It was hard for me in a few, as Eddie sure is a great talent. Would like to see more of him in the industry. The story well written, no special effects, no add-ins. Simple, understandable and easy to follow.I would recommend this to everyone. It really brings back all your senses, makes you stop and think. Wonderful, delightful, and surprising movie. A MUST SEE!!!"
" Warm, heart-melting story. Worth your every minute!
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"One of the trivia says: ""This is the first film Eddie Murphy has done in 4 years."" He has done an amazing job! It was worth waiting that long.I have not seen a movie like this, in a while. I was all around, lookin', but it found me instead, I guess. We all have our secrets and mysteries, and a reason behind it, which is why you should just leave it, as is, sometimes. Respect that people do not want you to dig deep. As humans, we are predestined to cross the boundaries, and break rules... but it is forgiveness that makes us greater. It is about an open heart.A lot of things to learn from this story. Give it a try!"
" Sweet Surprise
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,10,"After reading the description, I expected this movie to be boring and predictable, then watch the first 10 minutes and switch it off. 10 minutes turned in to 30, turned in to an hour, and next thing I knew I was watching the ending with tears rolling down my face. This movie is not for everyone. It is not an action-packed adventure with explosions and plot twists. It is a drama which focuses on the characters, their flaws, and their relationships with one another. Eddie Murphy is as good or better as a serious actor as he is a comedian or comedy actor (I love his stand-up and comedy movies; Harlem Knights, Coming To America, Norbit, Trading Places, Golden Child, Nutty Professor, etc. I mean, come on, that's some seriously funny stuff, and he's been at it and relevant for 30+ years, so he's got the chops.) (No spoilers, don't worry) This film is centered around the young female main character and watching her grow up, along with her mother, friends and acquaintances, and of course Mr. Church. She also does some narration throughout the film. The cooking/food scenes in the beginning of the film are what initially kept me watching, granted I am biased because I enjoy cooking/food related TV and movies. Eddie Murphy's acting and the character itself kept me hooked along with the supporting cast. This is one of those movies where the description sounds like it would be weak. It's not. It just works. Brilliantly."
" Realization
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"This is just so emotional movie that it is so sad, but at the same time you'll get to realize the importance of the people around you no matter how they play in your life. This movie will touch you all throughout that will leave your eyes teary without you even knowing it. The way the characters were played is like you're witnessing a soulful piece of art. One of the most striking part of this movie is how the circle revolves throughout the entire story. And you will not find any boring parts in it. You'll just find yourself watching as if something is crushing your heart but at the same time you see how lucky you are to have a family."
" Excellent movie! Eddie Murphy's finest work
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,10,"This movie was wonderful to watch and so thankful I had the opportunity to see it! A touching, caring and very moving story of humanity at its finest. To know that it's based off of a true life story makes it all the more incredible! The world would be a much better place if we all had a Mr. Church in our lives. Eddie Murphy's deliverance of Mr. Church I believe, is his finest quality work. His portrayal of his character captivated me from the beginning. He made the film. I hope he continues in the future with movies of this caliber and beauty. This movie is now on the top of my list of all time favorites and I will watch it again and again. It was that good."
" Unexpected pleasure
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,9,I found this movie on Amazon Prime and was intrigued when I read the summary. This has to be one of Eddie Murphy's best performances. Definitely not Axel Foley from Beverly Hills Cop. His performance as Mr. Church is very understated and so moving. He should be recognized for such a great performance. Britt Robertson's performance as Charlotte/Charlie was also very moving. She brings out the essence of a young lady facing the realities of high school and then college-the highs and lows. Another touching performance was given by Natasha McElhone as Charlie's single Mom facing her own highs and lows-with the help of Mr. Church who comes to cook for her and Charlie. I highly recommend this movie for those wanting just a good story.
" Bravo Eddie Murphy, Bravo
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,10,"This is an outstanding film! Eddie is pure perfection along with all the the other actors. I am so glad I came across this movie...it's one you'll watch again and again!Everything about this movie just did it for me..I love a good tear jerker and this one delivers. This movie makes you think..there is a lot of truth and real life in this film, things we all want. Things that happen to us we cannot share until the time is right. Mostly it shows how we can love unconditionally, beyond all barriers..it's shows there are no barriers if we only look with our hearts. Check this one out, there's a story for us all!"
" Brilliant Movie
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"Mr. Church is a film based on simplicity. The plot line is fairly predictable and the narrative seems somewhat circular. The movie however, is carried by the brilliant performances of leads, Eddie Murphy and Britt Robertson. A poor family, with a single mother suffering from terminal cancer and her young daughter, they gain the help of a cook, hired by the mother's former wealthy lover to help them until the mother dies — an expected 6 months. The plot then follows the lives of these characters, where the mother defies her physicians to live longer than expected. Many comments have been made in reviews about the positions of roles, a white family employing a subservient black man who seems to wait on them hand-and-foot and the racial undertones that accompany this. Perhaps I am being naive when I fail to see how this is any different from a carer being employed to look after a family, of any race, which in effect Murphy's character is being paid for. Further, the whole beauty of the film is the concept of human kindness, how small acts can have profound differences on the lives of those around us. When watching this film, you do not pity Mr. Church, if anything it makes you aspire to be like him: a man of many talents with an affinity for helping people. Murphy's character is one of dependability, reliability and kindness. We get glimpses into his personal life, through the perspective of Charlotte (Robertson) who takes a keen interests in getting to know him on a more personal level. We learn that even this calm dependable man can have secrets and vices. The biggest failing of the film I found was perhaps that not enough is revealed in the life of Mr. Church, to truly appreciate why finding a place in a family meant so much to him.My favourite quote from the movie has to be ""a book is meant to be read from beginning to end, but is best understood from end to beginning."" Which I believe is also true of this movie. It is only though learning of the life of Mr. Church that we can understand that so many of his admirable qualities are those that he has learned through helping others which makes Church that more inspirational."
" Don't judge a book by its cover! (*Spoiler just one quote)
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Seeing that Eddie Murphy is the cover I was skeptical but decided to give it a chance. Gotta always remember to never judge a book by its cover. Favorite line ""Some writers ain't happy till they made the reader cry. And some reader ain't happy till they do"". Raw Human emotions about human condition, pain, most of all love, friendship, and respect. This movie is so original it doesn't need fancy graphics but it has hidden golden expressions, emotions, values, and dialogue. Real connection can come from the most unexpected places and circumstances. Everyone at some point in their lives can relate to the message and hope this movie has. I recommend it to everyone don't let rotten tomatoes' critics think and evaluate it for you!! just give it a go and you won't be disappointed I promise. I never write reviews that much but sincerely enjoyed it and felt very compelled to share my experience with everyone."
" Perfect cast for an excellent family movie
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"I see this listed as a comedy/drama and I don't see where the comedy comes in. It's a very well told story and Mr. Church is a wonderful man, played by Eddie Murphy,with a history. I loved him in his comedic works but loved seeing him in a more dramatic role.I cried a lot watching this. Which is the sign you are feeling the emotions the actors are getting you to feel. I also when watching period movies, check out the costumes, the scenery and everything that takes you into those times. Very well done.Each cast member was perfect in the part they played making it seem like a real life story. I enjoyed it and highly recommend it."
