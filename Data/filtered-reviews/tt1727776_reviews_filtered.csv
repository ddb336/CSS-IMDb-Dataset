" One of my all time go to movies
",2021-04-12 00:00:00,8,Funny yet satisfying. It's a great time to just sit back and enjoy some senseless humor and gore. Love this more then I probably should.
" Outstanding moment for me.
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,9,"I won't add anything that anybody else has said, except the the stand-out moment for me. When the gang are going to Carters house to get his sisters diary, all the boys climb or jump over the back fence, Denise (Sarah Dumont) just steps over! Watch it! Just hilarious!"
" Unexpectedly funny
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,10,"Started watching this movie as it came up on the prime videos suggestions. It's hilarious.
Go for it."
" Overlong Comedy-Horror Flick
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,5,"When the zombies come to town, it's the three losers who are all that remains of the local Boy Scout troop who have to survive their onslaught. Everyone else - save the cute chick - has already left or been zombified,I was never a Boy Scout, so my familiarity with their motto, ""Be Prepared"" is mostly from Tom Lehrer songs. It's an amusing High Concept, like several others that appeared during the time, like PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES and ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER. Once you've stated the premise, what's left? Well, there's some fun with the sweet but geeky characters who are in over their heads, but that's not enough to keep this going for an hour and a half. Like many modern comedies, it goes on far too long."
" Really?
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,1,"This is the most stupid zombie movie I've ever seen, like honestly, who thought this was a good movie to make?"
" Craziness maxed out!!!!!
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,There are many zombie movies over internet which are on a serious note.... If you are 15+ then this movie is too funny to watch.... Its more than funny... Its damn CRAZY!!!!
" Awesome!!!
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,9,"One of the most awesome zombie comedies out there. It's just as good as Zombieland or any other famous zombie comedy movie. I'm really surprised why this movie isn't so popular. If you haven't watched it, you don't know how much you're missing. A must watch."
" Best zombie comedy since shaun of the dead, its THAT good!! Loved it!!
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,10,"I laughed a Lot , it was just a blast like a great motion ride!! Great acting by the whole cast, critics and people who dont get zombie movies especially comedy versions shouldn't review them cause they DON'T GET IT!! If they did this is an easy 7 or 8 all day long!! I purchased the bluray and so glad I did this is a MUST own for any comedy horror fans!!! I'm still laughing and stay for the end credits."
" Played it by mistake, glad i did it
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,8,"Its super fun, of course it dum and sometimes looks low budget. But i had a fun time watching it."
" Cult
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,7,"A classic cult movie, but the actress is eye catching. Not understand how come she can climb up the slide at the end..."
" Not a bad movie
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,9,"I thought this movie isn't bad at all. Don't know why but i just loved it. Pls make the second part, i want to see that badass girl denise again"
" oy Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is a blast of fun from start to finish!
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,8,"This is SO MUCH better than just another silly class B zombie clone. Do yourself a favour and watch it - but not if you are easily offended by some minor casual nudity! It is such a great spoof, it deserves to be recognized for the gem it is.Good writing, great acting, good filming and music - a classic in the making."
" A film that doesn't take itself to seriously
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,6,"Neither a 10 or a 2. It's worth watching with a few beers. One good laugh for me but the rest was passable. As someone else said, in lockdown I've watched worse. Plot holes but forgiven. Good reflection of what teen scouts feel about scouts."
" Highly entertaining
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,8,"Just what I needed after giving up on Blade runner 2049 on Amazon prime after one hour of a nothingness yawn fest.Scouts guide is fast paced fun, highly recommended. Reminds me of Ross Nobel's Stitches horror comedy."
" Smoke a pot and watch
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,4,That's the director view to who is want to see this movie
" Scouts did it right!!!!
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,9,"Oh my god this one's too funny to leave. It offers nudity and adult jokes at some places, but they are on point, it doesn't seem like the movie rely on them. And also, you don't have to shut down your brain to enjoy it."
" Best movie with both scouts and zombies in the title!!
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,6,"Lol!! Scouts vs Zombies,, well, coming from
a family of Scouts,, I had to see this upon hearing about it. It didn't disappoint!
It's perfectly stupid in the best of ways.
3 scouts find themselves in the middle
of a zombie outbreak going on in their hometown,, and hilarity ensues.
6.5!!!Just watch it!!"
" One of the best zombie movies of recent years...
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,9,"Now it took me about 5 years, to remember this movie existed, and looking back on it, it looked good in the trailers but I was too young to see it so I've waited and I recently stumbled upon it on the Google Play: Movies and TV app and rented it for only 2 dollars and gave it a watch.I was very surprised about how right off the bat, I was laughing. The opening was good and set expectations high for the rest of the movie and the rest of the movie definitely delivered. I think that the cast was really good, considering I only recognized a couple of them. Another thing about casting almost all unknowns is that you don't really know what to expect and you definitely can't predict how the audience will react. But I feel like it does matter to me if the cast is famous, as long as they can act, then the movie is just as good as any movie with an A-List Cast. Now I'm going to move onto my opinion on gore and effects.The movie has some nice effects, like when they hit the deer, it doesn't look too fake and when the a bunch of zombies get killed when they rescue people from the part I wasn't even thinking about how CGI it looked I was more focused on how creative their weapons were. I personaly think there is some decent gore, but don't expect anything too bad.Another thing is that I hate jumpscares and I don't think this movie has very many and if it does I remember it being scary because it keeps me on the edge of my metaphorical seat, but most importantly I didn't once at all regret watching the movie and I never wanted to click off. Thats why even some movies that I rate higher, I can't rank too high because they've made me want to click off and stop watching.And the ending was emotional because they actually got me to believe for a second that they were going to blow themselves up, but they are rescued by the main girl, but don't worry, I really epic explosion still happens, and its a happy ending for everyone except Scout Master Rogers who is alive even after everything, but now he is just a head.Overall this movie is good, memorable, and it's one of my personal favorites. One of my main problems with this film is that more people talk about Zombieland when this movie is way better. Not to say Zombieland is bad, it's just overrated. Anyway back to my point this movie is a solid 9/10 and I would give it higher but I don't think I'll ever give a ten."
" Silly crap
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,5,"I think director didn't want the movie to be taken seriously because from editing, direction cinematography and screenplay all looked below average. It's a movie just meant for some few laughs. Technically this movie is zero but for laughs it's an one time watch movie"
" Fantastic !
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,10,"Entertaining to watch for high school category.
Such an underrated movie. Constantly gives you smiles & laughs. Definitely worth the watch."
" Dvds alive
",2020-03-11 00:00:00,10,"I moved outside of my house. A noise had come from the floor, sounded like the minute hand of a clock not moving. I was outside, and saw guy leaning on a truck. Said: what's under your floor. I pointed into the distance and said: something over there is doing it. He handed me a pair of handcuffs (decorated with thousands of tiny words). 'Put these on,' he says. 'What do the words mean?' I ask. Impossible to know, put them on and move, thats what they want,' he said."
" Funny Teenage Humor
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,8,A funny movie to get a few immature laughs out of me
" Very good, silly zombie film.
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Character development is good, acting is good and storyline is good. What makes it even better is the silliness of it all (I won't give examples as it'll ruin the surprise)!
Over the top and very funny.
Great zombie film! Watch it!"
" Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,5,This is a silly zombie comedy featuring scouts. A lot of it does not make sense such as how did that stripper get into sexy costume and put her makeup on?When the zombie virus escapes from a laboratory thanks to an idiotic janitor. Ben (Tye Sheridan) Carter (Logan Miller) and Augie (Joey Morgan) use their scotung skills to fight off the zombies which includes Scout Leader Rogers (David Koechner) who just keeps coming back like a demented zombified terminator.This is an irreverent and illogical film that features a zombie dancing to Britney Spears and an action scene set to a Dolly Parton song.It is not as good or funny as Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland but teenagers would lap this up.
" fun
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,8,"Fun,lots of gore likeable charecters, whats not to like"
" Scout leader
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,10,"Totally awesome. I'm a Beaver leader. This made me lol, rofl and pmsl. Watch it. You won't regret it unless your sense of humour is totally non-uk!!!"
" Very entertaining horror/comedy.
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't expect that much on this film. I mostly bought the bluray because it was cheap, I like zombies and it had Halston Sage in it.Halston Sage has a small part, like 10 lines or something in total, so don't expect her to be a lead in this movie. The few minutes she is in, she is good in her role.Anyway, the movie is a comedy first, horror second movie, mostly about a few younger people trying to survive and do a few things.It's very funny, very rude, well acted, well directed, well everything really.
I never felt scared, but the action and gore was definitely there, in great quality too.As far as I am concerned this is a fantastic movie for what it tries to be. A funny action movie set in a horror theme.If you are easily disgusted, be careful, there are some very disgusting moments in it. Great special effects too.Unless you are very young or easily scared, this shouldn't scare you. But it will entertain you."
" Wait for it.....
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,9,"Wait for it all Im gonna say is lots of original zombie kills , yes its a lil juvenile but damn its entertaining and wait till the trampoline scene and OMG the cat lady's house!!!!!!!!!!!
P.S. Do not miss this. Oh and it's amazingly well done also."
" If you dont like this movie, you dont have a sense of humor
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,10,"Honsstly, a fun filled romp that has it all. Cheesy one liners, sad/weird small town characters. Relationship and coming of age film done zombie style. Gory blood soaked scenes that would make Raimi proud. Grata film, good pace, strong character development and laughs by the bucket full."
" I don't feel any more equipped for any kind of apocalypse but maybe that's the point.
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,7,"Standard teen horror comedy, this time on the theme of friendship versus the pressure to grow up.There's nothing much to say beyond it's macabre good fun that handles its character development adequately though it doesn't always make sense."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,5,"Had some funny parts and a few memorable scenes. Made me laugh a good amount. But also some stupid stuff. And I didn't think any of the actors were funny themselves, other than David Koechner (1 viewing)"
" How could this have such bad ratings?
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,10,"Does no one understand satire? When the movie started, I thought it was going to be a cheap B-rated movie, but TBH, I think they did a really good job of balancing gross, with humor, with double humor, with nudity, and of course... with zombies.There are a lot of double entendres in the film, so you have to be listening or watching very closely for them, because you are already laughing at some of it when an even funnier joke is told.I loved it. It reminded me of Leslie Nielson movie."
" It's dumb and derivative; - Scout's honor
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,5,"Let's see... We've had Nazi zombies, zombie beavers, Cuban zombies, Russian zombies, Aussie zombies, zombie strippers, retired zombies, zombie toddlers, intelligent zombies, mockumentary zombies, space zombies, ex-girlfriend zombies, drug-addicted zombies, football zombies, political zombies, cowboy zombies, zombie nerds, Lederhosen zombies, etc. I could probably list another dozen of variations and then simply add ""And now we also have zombie boy scouts"" at the end, but the point is rather clear. There's an oversupply of zombie comedies in all kind of shapes, settings or specific situations.I really don't want to sound like a sourpuss, because most of these films are well-made and reasonably entertaining, but the issue is that they are fundamentally all derivative, mundane and tiresome. Without even looking at the trailer, social outcasts turn into unlikely saviors because their geeky habits come in handy, bullies and other loathsome townsfolk attack them in nasty zombie versions, and the biggest dork of the bunch gets to kiss the high-school princess at the end.Of course, I'm well aware that we don't necessarily watch these ""zomedies"" for their innovative and intellectual plots. We watch them in the hope of seeing excessive gore, gratuitous sleaze, and maybe even a handful of memorable moments or ingenious gimmicks. Even in this area, ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" is seriously lacking if you ask me. The gore is adequate enough, although too much special effects are computer-generated, and the girls in the cast (Sarah Dumont, Halston Sage, Niki Koss...) are yummy. There's also a great scene with cats' eyes, but that about wraps up the good news. Where were the stand-alone splatter/comedy highlights? I only remotely chuckled with the Dolly Parton references and the one scene where one of scouts can't resist fondling Missy Martinez' giant fake zombie breasts. Embarrassing moments, on the other hand, there are plenty. It's a stupid sight to see a living corpse sing Britney Spears' greatest hit, and penis-stretching is simply infantile. And yes, I do realize I sound like a sourpuss now, but how disrespectful is it to cast the legendary Cloris Leachman (""The Last Picture Show"", ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Dying Room Only"", ...) as a toothless old hag who tries to bite a teenager's butt?"
" Why watch ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" ?
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,8,"Christopher Landon's ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" is a motion picture that absolutely deserves the public's appreciation. Mixing the amusing story of three childhood friends with jaw dropping zombies in order to create a film that captures the true sense of comedy and action.It is clear that the cast was meticulously picked with actors such as Tye Sheridan, Sarah Dumont and Halston Sage delivering a great performance and proving that this movies is to be taken seriously. Now, let's get into why this it is worth watching.Firstly, the setting of this story take place in a very ""sympathetic"" environment that relate to most Americans. Regular size houses, rather seductive surroundings with very traditional public places that embody the classic town found in the U.S. These components all make it super easy for the public to picture themselves in the very context of the movie.Secondly, the storyline of ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" is terrifically exiting as the continuous action and humour always seem to take over what might appear as ""slow parts"" of a movie. There are no points in the film where you will find yourself disinterested or confused by what is going on. I was personally impressed by how the references to modern day culture especially in the music department were included. They added a fun and pleasant mood to some scenes which directly affected the overall positive result of the movie.Finally, I would like to state that this film has a fantastic plot with very attaching characters that make this one of the most entertaining movie out there. If you are bored and looking for a feature to remember, I would most definitely place this on your list."
" Surprisingly entertaining
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,7,"There's always a zombie film on TV and most of the time I don't bother with them. I don't know what prompted me to record this one but I did.It's not amazing and it's got yer run of the mill story development (friends fall out then make up) and a really, really, really pointless love aspect that could have been completely omitted and it would have actually made the film better. BUT, I still enjoyed it. The pace was good, the characters none too bad, it kept me entertained (I get bored easily these days) and it even made me laugh out loud once. I know that doesn't sound like much but rarely does a film ever cause me to laugh out loud (it was the bit where the zombie's, er, manhood (?) gets ripped off if anyone is wondering).There's a lot of zombies and a lot of zombie killing and a scene in the nightclub at the end that reminded me of the lawnmower sequence in Peter Jackson's Braindead.Yeah, it could have been a LOT better if they spent a bit more time on the script but I enjoyed it and if I was in the mood for a zomedy sometime in the future then I'd consider watching this again."
" Zombie Cat, Zombie Breasts and Zombie Genitalia!
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,7,"I was just expecting a stupid low-budget comedy about zombies and to some degree I was correct except that it was not low budget this one seemed to have a fair nice budget to it adding to some pretty good special effects and CGI and it made it much more easier to watch because of that.
I thought I had seen everything in zombie movies but this one like my title says had zombie cats, zombie deer ,Zombie breasts( courtesy of porn actress Missy Martinez) and yes even a zombie penis! Haha.
Be warned there's also a zombie performing oral sex on a victim before he kills her and even an elderly zombie played by the great character actress Cloris Leachman trying to bite one of our heroes without her dentures trying to give him a zombie gum attack on his butt cheeks haha
And also in a small role is Arnold's son Patrick and that might explain why the budget in this movie is a little bit more than above-average I think maybe daddy Arnold wanted to make sure his son Patrick was in something good even though it was a stupid comedy but he still wanted his son to shine nonetheless .
so all in all it's worth the check at least one time it's almost like Super Bad meets Ghostbusters meets The Walking Dead type of thing so enjoy!"
" Obviously not actual scouts...
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,5,"Christopher Landon - the son of Michael Landon - is known today for his two Happy Deathday movies, but before that, he directed three Paranormal Activity films and this, a movie he said was ""a gory R-rated version of The Goonies and Gremlins or even The Monster Squad.""The movie starts with Ron the janitor (Blake Anderson from TV's Workaholics) is cleaning a lab and generally not paying any attention to his surroundings, a medical experimentation lab. He accidentally releases a zombie and is bitten, then attacks a scientist before the opening credits roll.That's when we meet out heroes - Ben (Tye Sheridan, the latest X-Men movies, Ready Player One), Carter and Augie - trying to recruit more members for their scout troop. Augie loves being a scout, but his friends want to grow up and become more popular.As they argue in a car about it - Augie is about to get the highest honor, the Condor Patch from Scoutmaster Rogers (David Koechner) - they hit a deer which gets up despite being dead. Meanwhile, we see the seeds of romance between Carter's sister Kendall (Halston Sage from TV's The Orville) and Ben.Kendall's boyfriend invites Ben and Carter to a Secret Senior Party. As they go to get alcohol for their big night out, they run into a cocktail waitress named Denise. She hits it off immediately with Ben when he fixes her purse and buys booze for the boys.The guys meet up with Augie for a night of camping, but the Scout Master hasn't shown. Despite a great talk about what their friendship means, they still ditch Augie for the party, but decide to stop at the strip club. They're soon attacked by zombies and saved by Denise.Augie goes to find his Scout Master, who has been zombified, and the rest of our heroes get locked into a holding cell and surrounded by zombies. What follows are a series of adventures as they learn that the town has been overtaken and is scheduled to be bombed by the military.Everyone splits up, with Denise trying to get to the military and the boys trying to save their friends at a party. There's a great scene here where the boys ""Rambo up"" and use a hardware store and their merit badge skills to get ready to attack the zombies.The wholesale zombie destruction that ensues is pretty awesome, with some great gore and plenty of humorous moments. I really like the blue tones and neon effects here, as it's different than any zombie film I've seen, as the party is turned into a feeding ground for the undead.I also liked that being scouts uniquely prepared the boys for surviving. It's a fun idea that's told pretty well. I also dug some of the Easter eggs, like Haddonfield only being a few miles away and the trampoline being lifted from the classic videogame Zombies Ate My Neighbors."
" Very funny
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,7,"Really enjoyed this film, it made me laugh on many different occasions however I think they could've done so much more with the 15 million budget. The other thing that annoyed was the fact that ugly sod got with both of them fit birds like what a utter joke."
" Never heard of it before...
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,7,But enjoyed it anyway. The movie has some flaws when it comes to make-up and cgi (compared to zombieland for example) but all in all its a very watchable teenage-zombie-comedy-flick with some nice splatterscenes..the police-tits scene had me chuckling for a while
" More crunch for your time
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,4,"A feel good movie about a bunch of nerds fighting the stereotypical regime of school and popularity. I enjoyed the movie, for the low budget that it had. It did an excellent job of providing satisfaction and entertainment, however it wouldn't be worth a repeat of time to see it again, nor is the ending logically sensible... The nerdy boy at the end getting with the popular girl (= just never happens) also killing off the scoutmaster was funny, but again very un-idealistic.Good movie. Low expectations."
" Best Zombie film ever
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,10,Never laughed so much. Great plot. Good cast. So very funny
" I literally haven't laughed this much watching a film in a while.
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,7,"I literally haven't laughed this much watching a film in a while. From Start to finish I was chuckling. In certain scene's I was hysterical with laughter. Yes Scouts Guide To The Zombie Apocalypse feels like America's answer to Shaun Of The Dead. Yes we have Zombie Land. That as well was hysterical. However to me this film had me laughing more. My personal opinion, but then again I have a strange sense of humour. And yes I could relate because I used to be a scout.So what is Scouts Guide To The Zombie Apocalypse?To put it simply, it's a zombie film where the main hero's are 3 scouts against a horde of Zombie's. Right there is an idea that already has me chuckling. The film starts off in funny lip-syncing fashion of a Janitor having way to much fun mouthing to Iggy Azalea while the opening credits come onto screen. We are then shown the basic cause to the 'Zombie Apocalypse'. This is how it goes:Scientist working on a zombie. Janitor finds zombie while Scientist goes to vending machine. Janitor gets scared when heart monitor stops working. Janitor then try's to give the Zombie CPR. Zombie wakes up while Janitor gives CPR. Zombie chases Janitor around laboratory while scientist gets his arm stuck in vending machine. Scientist gets his arm out of vending machine and Un dead Janitor is behind him.That's the basic gist of how humorous the opening scene is, but you'll have to watch it to see the full hilarity.We are then introduced to our 3 heroes. Scout members Ben Goudy, Carter Grant and Augie Foster. They are on the eve of Augie receiving his Condor badge. However unknown to Augie, Carter and Ben secretly want to quit the scouts.On a run in with a deer crashing into the front of Ben's car, we meet Carter's sister, boyfriend and friend. We find out that Ben is secretly in love with Carter's sister Kendall. Carter and Ben are then 'Invited' to a secret clubbing event. However Ben has reservations as the event falls on the same night that Augie will be receiving his Condor badge. Carter hatches a plan to ditch Augie after they all fall asleep, got to the event, and return in the morning. Things start to turn weird in the small town when Ben realises the deer he hit with his car has all of a sudden vanished.Shortly after this all hell breaks loose and the town turns into a post apocalyptic zombie nightmare. It is down to Ben, Carter and Augie to find and save Carter's sister.Now I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I was laughing from beginning to end. They are down right over the top gags at times from a zombie signing 'Hit me baby one more time' to zombie cats. Yes you here me Zombie Cats!The film felt revitalised. Injected with more life with its humour. We're living in an age where zombies are big in pop culture. They have infected our films, our TV, our video games and books. This means that zombies are popular and there is a high demand for them. Yet on the other hand having title upon title released with zombies being the prime theme, it becomes exhausting and tiresome. Most films now that has zombies in them lack originality.They're just constant gore fests!!The walking Dead only survives because it is a strong character driven show. Video games on the other hand are upon the most overloaded form of media filled with zombies.However this is a film blog not a video game related blog. What I'm trying to get at here is that this film knew that zombies are big in pop culture so instead decided to poke fun at that idea.So in conclusion Scouts guide to a zombie apocalypse is a film that goes against the conventions of normal zombie films. It's not a horror. It's a comedy and a good one. Something with originality within a genre that is in no way filled with originality."
" My Scouts Loved It
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,10,"We have an annual movie night with the scouts, and decided the last movie would be this. They LOVED it! We'd seen the trailer and put the younger ones to bed first, and let the older ones stay with us."
" When zombies attack and you are too cool for school - blow up the gym
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,7,"Set in a genre which has grown over the last few years (if not bordering saturation) this film is a mix of horror and comedy with all the elements you'd expect to find in a film aimed at 20-40-year olds - bad language, sexual content, nudity, gross-out gore, action, and tongue in cheek humour. It tells the story of 3 boy scouts who want to grow - two of them have been enticed with the prospect of sexuality and all things cool in a coming of age way, while the other just wants to be the best darn scout he can possibly be. To coincide with a camping trip a zombie virus is let loose in their small town, with the residents slow to respond most people are wiped out and it's left to the 3 scouts to build bridges amongst themselves and save anyone near and dear to them. Tye Sheridan, Logan Miller and Joey Morgan take the lead roles in this film and they deliver well in this Christopher Landon film. It's a cross between ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""McGuyver"" (or the ""A-Team"") in that, when the film gets going there is no end to their creativity and inventiveness - evidently the skills of being a good scout transfer well to zombie killing. It's an entertaining film which has some fun moments in it, the plot isn't that revolutionary as it follows a standard trope; boy fancies girl but daren't say anything, boy loses girl due to zombie apocalypse, boy realises his feelings due to impending doom from zombies (and a little help from cocktail waitress), boy fights the horde to get girl. Eagle eyed viewers and fan of zombies and horror will be quick to spot some fun Easter eggs along the journey, from the ""Haddonfield"" sign to the ""Jockey"" zombie from the ""Left 4 Dead 2"" game, to the trampoline escape a-la ""Zombies ate my neighbours"" game. All in all, an enjoyable ride which seems to have suffered from bad marketing - I say that because I'd never heard of the film and only stumbled across it by accident. Pacing is decent and I can't remember many wasted moments of screen time, and the score/soundtrack was as young and fresh as I'd expect from a film of this kind. Much better than a lot of the run of the mill B-movies being pumped out nowadays and I'd recommend this to friends without a doubt. I'm giving this a solid 7 out of 10."
" I Loved This Movie
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,8,"It was way better than I expected. Ireally thought it was going to be stupid, but once it got going it was awesome."
" Quite entertaining
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,6,"Three scouts and a sexy waitress battle zombies in a small town that is suffering an apocalypse, caused by an accidental viral outbreak. 
After Shaun of the Dead the zombie sub genre has been over saturated by silly zombie films with ever sillier titles, and having sat through quite a few I watched this with little expectation. Thankfully this one turned out better than many.
The film is fast paced with plenty of onscreen violence and some decent special effects, although the CGI does look obvious. Lots of humour including plenty of toilet and sex gags, including one of our heroes pulling on the penis of an old zombie. Another great scene has another old zombie who has lost her dentures unable inflict a flesh bite. Special mention to David Koechner as the toupee wearing, Dolly Parton loving scout leader come zombie.
Fun movie but I'd probably not watch it again."
" Brain-dead, and then some
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,3,"SCOUTS GUIDE TO THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE (where's the apostrophe?) is an annoyingly childish zombie comedy that seems content to riff on what's come previously rather than offering anything witty or insightful. When I compare this film to genuine classics like RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD then I sometimes wonder if cinema's going backwards. Not that I enjoyed ZOMBIELAND when it came out last decade, but SCOUTS GUIDE is infinitely worse. A group of the dumbest and most unappealing protagonists ever go around making tired gags while a zombie apocalypse plays out around them. The emphasis is on the obvious and the gross-out, neither of which hold appeal for me. The FX are achieved via cheap CGI and not particularly believable, while all of the twists and set-pieces are overly familiar. A couple of riffs on the likes of DIE HARD etc. made little sense to me, and overall I felt like I was simply too old to enjoy this one."
" A laugh
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,6,As the title probably suggests this is by no means a cinematic masterpiece or what it potentially could've been but regardless the unusual concept of pitting off innocence and evil against each other is quite welcoming and fun as we see three scouts 'corrupted' by the unfolding apocalypse. As I've previously said no classic in the making but certainly a brisk laugh that's very light hearted a good rainy day watch
" DID I JUST DROP ACID?
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,8,"When the zombie apocalypse happens, the police and military are of no use. Three scouts team up with a savvy stripper (Sarah Dumont) to save the secret senior party and Ben's (Tye Sheridan) crush (Halston Sage).This was a fun nonsense zombie film. The viral outbreak also effect animals such as deer and kittens. The scene of them getting ready to do battle against the zombies happened way too late into the film. Could have used more Scorpions.Guide: F-bomb, topless zombie."
" Pretty Good Zombie Flick!
",2018-02-05 00:00:00,6,"This 2015 horror comedy stars Tye Sheridan, Logan Miller, Joey Morgan
and Sarah Dumont. This begins with a zombie killing 2 employees at
a science research lab. We then meet pals, Ben (Sheridan), Carter (Miller)
and Augie (Morgan) who are scouts going camping in the wilderness.
Soon, they discover that the residents nearby are turning into zombies and fight against them with help of sexy, cocktail waitress, Denise (Dumont). David Koechner (Anchorman) and Cloris Leachman (Bad Santa) also appear. This is a pretty good zombie flick with creepy and hilarious moments featuring a decent cast & gruesome make-up effects. I recommend this 
if you're a fan of zombie flicks or horror in general."
" great film
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,7,This one is a gem for me...it is one of the greatest comedy horror teenagers films i have ever seen... ita was fearfull and funny too....well done...
" the heart and feeling of zombie land
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,10,Its a great movie with a lot of good vibes its not really a scary movie perse but its got the same relaxed feel and its like what real people would do in a zombie Apocalypse and honestly one of the best zombie movies ive seen
" If you've seen one 'zom-com'
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,5,"Once upon a time a zombie film was a rarity after the millennium. Now it seems that the genre has been done to death and distorted and blended with every other genre in an attempt at keeping it fresh. Here, in 'Scouts' Guide to a Zombie Apocalypse' we have a comedy/horror (or 'zomcom' as I'm informed they're referred to as). However, a gory undead outing with laughs is nothing new – and it hasn't been since about 2004's 'Shaun of the Dead.' And, in short, it doesn't even come close to 'Shaun of the Dead.' This isn't a bad film. It just offers absolutely nothing new. If you're a fan of zombie films then you've seen better. If you're a fan of zombie-comedy films then you've seen better. If you just like gore there's about as much gore in the average episode of 'The Walking Dead' as you have here.It's about a group of geeky scouts who get caught up in an undead uprising. Pretty soon you have all the tropes you'd come to expect with the genre, i.e. boarding up windows, headshots, have-sex-and-die moments and characters turning into zombies after being bitten. There's the obligatory hot girl and geek will they/won't they subplot and the only really memorable actor (David Kochner) is woefully underused. This film kind of reminds me of both 'Dance of the Dead' and 'Deadheads' in tone and feel, only they're both better! There's about one really funny (if a little gross!) moment involving what someone is forced to hang on to when about to fall out of windows and the zombie animals made me smile, but that's about it really. The ending tries to be exciting, but – guess what – I've seen people using hedge trimmers to slice up zombies with before (Peter Jackson's 'Braindead') and I just got annoyed when no one noticed a zombie attack on a crowded dance floor (surely someone would have filmed and uploaded it to Instagram?!).I can only recommend this if you really love zombie/comedy films and you've never seen one before. Otherwise, just put your DVD of 'Shaun of the Dead' in – I know you've got a copy somewhere!"
" Misses more than it hits
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,5,"The title suggests a comedy, possibly for kids. And yes, a band of scouts will use their skills and props to fight friends, bullies and unknowns who have turned undead. But not before being confronted with several situations and choices that force them to look back at their lives, friendship and growing up.The movie has great production value and some very nice gore and other effects. But this is also where it misses. It could've been a ""horror"" meant for a very young audience, like Goosebumps was for kids. After a few moments of innocent fun, the movie becomes a shameless teen movie with too many references to sex.Comedy can be successful if the lead character IS comedy (Jim Carrey), or if funny moments happen to the oblivious character (Ben Stiller). But a comedy fails if it feels like the movie started as 2 or 3 jokes, and the movie was written around it. This is the case and the jokes weren't even that good. It's the forced comedy in scenes about hanging on to a penis, or groping a big-breasted zombie that made us realize that this is nothing more than flat, unoriginal comedy meant for an audience that has low to zero demands. The innocence is lost with the quality and even people looking for nothing more than fun, will forget they had fun with this flick."
" Hilarious and Scary!
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,7,"The title has explained about this film, that is a zombie comedy with a high school friends background. And for zombie running fans, this is a movie that must be seen because it has element of surprises and definitely not bad at all for the special effects. High school best friends, girls, strip club, zombies, armies, and party. Just enjoy the movie!"
" Scouts trying to save the world.
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,7,"The title nor image for this movie had stirred my interest, but I decided to give a try. When I first saw Blake Anderson's scene, I had a good belly laugh and decided to stick around a bit longer. I feel as if the whole story lost it's potential without him as lead, I don't understand why they decided to get rid of him so early in the movie. It was somewhat tedious watching the characters in the movie as they seemed already too cliché, somewhat saved by the scout leader (David Koechner) again too short of an appearance and what a shame that nobody saw the story and potential of the janitor and scout leaders potential in this movie. All in all it was an OK movie, could have been better in my opinion if they had kept Blake Anderson and David Koechner around though, seemed like a no brain-er to me, they're the only reason I give this a seven."
" Lacks compared to other Zombie films
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,5,"Comparing this film to other Zombie films, Scouts Guide doesn't rank among those other films such as Zombieland or even Shawn of the Dead. Scouts is rating R which is filled with lots of language, some nudity and typical zombie violence but the atmosphere of the film feels more so PG-13 (or so towards its audience). Not much comedy in the film and it results in off bizarre zombie gags that aren't funny. The lead character of Ben (Tye Sheridan) does a good job playing the likable lead character along with his friends, which are there as typical characters and not as likable. This film plays out as a cross between Superbad and Zombieland, but not as funny or entertaining, interesting as those two. Scouts is quite decent but as a whole it's otherly predictable and quite forgettable."
" Actually made me laugh out loud ... a rather thing in movies these days
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,9,"A great little movie, that doesn't achieve the heights that it could have, but ... there is enough here as a silly, non-serious zombie flick that actually has some great laugh out loud moments that most films simply cannot achieve.Well put together, a few generic story lines ... but weaved together with joy and enthusiasm ... this must have been a hoot to make, with a good cast and some great moments ... zombie cats anyone?Get some friends, some booze and kick back for some unexpected giggles ... and some penis grabbing, booby loving, teen style zombie bashing goodness."
" the concept is there
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,6,"A slacker janitor at a lab causes chaos unleashing the zombie apocalypse. Augie Foster, Ben Goudy and Carter Grant are best friends and scouts. They are also getting old to be scouts under Scout Leader Rogers (David Koechner). Nobody else is signing up. Ben and Carter want to leave. They hit a deer on the road. Carter's sister Kendall Grant, her boyfriend Jeff and her friend Chloe stop on their way to a party. The deer disappears. Ben and Carter plan to sneak away from the scout campout later that night to join the party. Rogers is attacked by zombies. Ben befriends hot strip club waitress Denise Russo who buys beer for the boys and later come to their rescue.The concept is right there in the title. The start is alright. It's all set up and ready to go. I am expecting something smart and funny like Shaun of the Dead. The first thing I would add is some kind of Scout handbook (Guide) which the boys use to battle the zombies. The closest is Augie trying to scare the Britney Spears zombie. That could have been funnier but at least they tried. It's a lot hot women, zombies, and three geeky dudes. The guys are non-descript but solid geeks. The writing is simply not smart enough. It's still better than most zombie B-movies. This could be something really fun but it's only more of the same."
