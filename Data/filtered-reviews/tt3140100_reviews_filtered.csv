" Degenerates into a Really Vile Story
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,"If you took away the graphic violence and sex it would have been ok, but gradually it just lost my attention as the plot unfolded about truly awful characters.
I can't call this entertainment, it was just too disturbing."
" Department Q - Beats Most UK / USA Thrillers Into A Cocked Hat
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,8,"Having just started watching the Department Q series after reading the books, I have to say that they do a very good job bringing them to life and this one is no exception.This one is not as mysterious or intriguing as the first book/film in the series and follows a more conventional route but it is actually better than the first movie which I actually just watched back to back with this one as it was so good. The secret is in the characters; you really feel for Carl, Rose & Assad and the story winds its way masterfully to the end and gives you the only possible ending for the victims and with great storytelling, photography and direction it is far and above one of the best thrillers I have seen this year having just gotten into the foreign genres of disaster and thriller movies and this rates alongside De behandeling (2014) and the magnificent Abgeschnitten (2018) as my favourite thrillers of the year."
" Great sequel
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,8,"The Absent One is a sequel, in the best sense of the word. Everything in the original was multiplied by 2 times. The plot here is much better twisted, suspense is not bad. I advise everyone to watch, there have been fewer such detectives on TV recently."
" Complex crime investigation movie..!!
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,This movie is second part of department Q sequel movie...story plot is better than first part and little complex soo little challenge to understand the whole plot story...four rich guys do killing and raping but they didnt bring justice but after 20 years 2 detectives tries to bring them to justice and finally they made too...worth watching second time too...
" Good premise bad acting and unnecessary long
",2020-03-06 00:00:00,5,"It started quite well and the story overall is not a bad one. But there are 2 major flaws. The first being bad acting. Almost all actors are trying too hard to be believable and instead become caricatures of their characters that for me personally breaks the experience. It doesn't help that the script makes them too stereotypical, predictable and just boring. The main good guy has one single facial expression throughout the film. The second flaw is that for what is supposed to be a detective story is solved and presented on the plate too early in the film and half way through it starts to become a sluggish experience. And the more it gets to the end the more silly it becomes, with plot holes, stupid decisions of the characters and cheap dialogue. I usually watch every movie till the end, but I had to really force myself to do that with this one."
" A serious man cleraring cases
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,6,"Don't get me wrong, I quite like this series, but I have to mention this: Claus Mørck is an idiot. He does risky and frankly stupid stuff, which results in him being hit in the head, repeatedly. He is also a humourless, gloomy tosser, and the series could benefit from him lighting up a bit. Yes, they deal with deadly serious matter, but you can't go on like that, you'll be a nervous wreck in months. But after having seen the first three installments, I'm sure I'd like to watch the next ones, too."
" A gritty thriller with some minor flaws.
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,7,"Just to be clear, I give ""Fasandræberne"" the same rating as its predecessor. Reason being, what it lacks in storytelling it weighs up with entertainment value. In this sequel, Carl Mørch (Lie Kaasen) and Assad (Fares) deals with a group of creme de la creme type of guys who's past at an exclusive boarding school leaves a lot to wish for in terms of splendid behavior. The mystery solving itself is not as well executed as in the prequel but the film's brutality, gore, and shock value exceeds that of the former. Thus is ""Fasandræberne"" I highly entertaining thriller."
" The author hates the movie and I understand him.
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,3,"I read the book earlier this week and just watched the movie. I could only recognize about one percent of it!
I'll bet none of those who likes this movie has read the book."
" Dares to be dark
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,7,"""Fasandraeberne"" tells the story of a group of upper class students that seek a thrill by being brutal and humiliating others until unforeseen events change their lives forever.In comparison to many other tv crimes, this production dares to be both dark and explicit. It isn't a splatter film, it only uses harder graphical material when it benefits the story and adds to the intensity of the film. The case itself is interestingly presented, some might say a bit over the top, some might find some typical tv crime elements but overall I'd say that it keeps a solid balance and keeps you both entertained and able to buy in on the plausibility of what happens.All in all this is really a thriller and not just another tv production that barely makes your heart beat faster. It doesn't change the game but it understands well to play by its rules and deliver what the audience asks for."
" Great Franchise
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,8,"Police Detective Carl Mørck (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) stumbles upon an old man nearby the Police Department Building and he asks if Carl had checked the documentation he sent to him. Carl does not give much attention to the man and two hours later the man is found dead after committing suicide in his bathtub. Carl convinces his partner Assad Pilou (Fares Fares) to reopen an old case where the twins of the old man had been murdered and soon Carl and Assad are involved in a network of old crimes where the powerful executives and millionaires Ditlev Pram (Pilou Asbæk) and his friend Ulrik Dybbøl (David Dencik) seem to be responsible for. Now they are chasing Ditlev´s former girlfriend Kimmie (Danica Curcic), who might be the key witness of the cases. But the criminals are hunting her down.""Fasandræberne"", a.k.a. (""Department Q: The Absent One"". Is another great franchise with a new case of Police Detectives Carl Mørck and Assad Pilou. The structure of the bleak story is similar to the first film with the use of flashbacks. The performances are top-notch again and the screenplay does not use the clichés of a crie film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Departamento Q: O Ausente"" (""Department Q: The Absent One"")"
" Nothing So Simple As ""Evil""
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,9,"Everything I said in my review of the first film in the series (Keeper of the Lost Causes) applies to this, the second installment. Gritty, dark and disturbing. It is textured and believable with an intense verisimilitude as to not only the environment and behavior of the police but throughout the social strata where the other characters dwell. And, as in the earlier film, this one is as commendable for the attention to fleshing out the damaged creatures committing unspeakable acts as it is to developing the mechanics of the plot, the social themes underlying the series, and the growth (or collapse) of the lead players. And I cannot sing the praises high enough for a thriller, so realistic, that a main character gets struck in the head with a pipe, and rather that soldiering on like a superhero he falls, and then later collapses with a concussion. This series is about human beings; the weak and the strong, the good and the bad, and such simplistic terms like Hero and Evil Villain are neither welcomed nor adhered to."
" Excellent!
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,10,Excellent adaptation of the book. Great casting. Please do more movies of the Department Q series!
" Despite its flaws it is worth seeing
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,6,"I give the movie 6 stars. Why only 6? Well, if it were not for some absurdities that requires far more than the suspension of disbelief I would have voted 8. The movie is gripping, the acting is good, the photography is dark and suggestive, the characters are troubled and interesting and the story is touching.The detective pair, Carl the troubled one and Assad the more positive thinker, reminds me of other famous nordic investigative couples I saw in ""Forbridelsen"" (Sarah Lundt and her changing buddies) and in ""Bron-Broen"" (Saga and Martin). The chemistry between them is good and they are likable, even Carl with his nihilism.I did not read the novel and I don't know if the screenwriter and the director were faithful or not to the written story, but in the movie there are points where I thought ""Oh my ... how can it be possible?""SPOILER: How can Kimmie, a mentally troubled homeless woman that has been living in a dirty cart for years, transform herself in few hours into a club vamp dressed in fashion, with a perfect makeup and a blond wig, with no sign of her chronic psychotic behavior? This is beyond credibility, even considering scenic fiction.How can Kimmie overpower armed, strong and combat trained men fronting her? This happens four times: when ambushed in the cart, in her friend's house when she escapes Carl, in the detective apartment after the disco and last in the jail. Talk me about SuperHomelessWoman. Even this is beyond the credibility of scenic fiction.I do not understand why they did not try to make the whole thing more realistic or at last more believable.The story unfolds between past and present and I found some of the flashback scenes slightly disturbing as they show physical and psychological cruelties.This is a sad story without a real happy ending, but worth seeing despite its flaws."
" A deep gaze into the abyss
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,8,"Nowadays, Jussi Adler-Olsen is probably the most successful Danish thriller writer with his latest book 'Selfies' (which is, in my opinion, very weak, but that's another point) again on the best- seller list. 'The Absent One' is the second installment in the Department Q film series originally released in 2008. Like its predecessor the film is directed by Mikkel Norgaard who reunites with the lead stars Kaas and Fares. After a former cop commits suicide leaving behind the unsolved case of the brutal killing of his two children the lugubrious detective Carl Morck and his kind assistant Assad begin to investigate. Their only trace is a call by a girl, Kimmie Larsen, from the boarding school nearby the place where the assault happened. She leads the detectives to a group of powerful and affluent men headed by the famous Ditlev Pram who is ready to do whatever it takes to come to terms with the past. Therefore, the plot again alternates between the 1990s (Kimmie, Ditlev and the others) and the 2010s (the investigation).First of all, the big plus of the film is the menacing and saturnine atmosphere it creates – among the thrillers, only Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy features a deeper gaze into the abyss. Ditlev, the leader of the group, is a sadistic and Mephistophelian psychopath who loves to destroy others. In the present, it is the world in which Kimmie lives that is full of gloom. She has psychic problems and her only friend is a drug addict. There is almost no light and fun in the world of Department Q and the disturbing opening scene already sets the tone. The big threat in form of Ditlev and his henchmen creates a chilling and tense effect and therefore, you want to see how our very favorite detective duo (hopefully) will give these monsters what they deserve. Since the film depicts brutality, torture and rape, 'The Absent One' is not for the faint-hearted. What I also liked about the story is how it deals with the character of Kimmie, the girl who calls the police during that murderous night. She is somehow a round character: On the one hand, she liked the violent behavior of Ditlev and had also fun to beat others to death. Nonetheless, she made the call and realized that they have crossed some lines. There is somehow a change in her attitude towards Ditlev (of course, we learn why but I will not spoil it) which is the reason why Carl wants to help here, although she is as guilty and as criminal as the others. Consequently, Kimmie is not just another boring insane killer, but she shows that there is not always black and white, good and evil in the world. Kimmie is a shade of gray and this makes her an interesting character. Furthermore, humor would have been important to give some variation in all this violence. There are some humorous comments especially by Carl but there could have been more. This is something which the next film does better. Concerning certain cinematic devices, beside the use of light and dull colors the score by Johan Söderqvist, Patrik Andren and Uno Helmersson reflects the darkness of the film too. The haunting leitmotiv which appears often during the film underlines the deep pain the characters' live(d) through, while Kimmie's theme has some beauty and warmth in it. I'm glad that there is a soundtrack album out! Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Fares Fares are a well-interacting team. Particularly noteworthy is how Kaas plays Morck with almost no happiness or smiling on its face which emphasizes how much he suffers from his job and the attack on him and his colleagues at the beginning of The Keeper of the Lost Causes. Danica Curcic who plays the present day Kimmie gives a similarly strong performance, while Johanne Louise Schmidt as Rose is a refreshing new member of the team. Pilou Asbæk plays the main antagonist and psychopath Ditlev who sticks at nothing to save himself. Well-known for his work in 'Borgen' he gives Ditlev a dangerous and unpredictable arrogance. Overall, 'The Absent One' features a typical Scandinavian well- interwoven thriller plot full of vengeance, revelations and some scary crimes. There is nothing veritable new in the genre of the Scandinavian crime thriller – the depressive coat-wearing detective or the different detective duo are tried and trusted ingredients. Nevertheless, Norgaard uses the literary source well, although it has some clichés. In short terms, the film is more emotional and fast-paced than 'The Keeper of the Lost Causes' and therefore a nerve-racking thriller!8 pts."
" The Department Q Series-Part 2:The Absent One.
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,9,"Nearing the end of the magnificent second series of the Nordic Noir TV show Follow The Money,I started to read the Nordic Noir book Mercy (Department Q 1)by Jussi Adler-Olsen. Looking for more info on Olsen's work,I checked online,and found three Department Q adaptations. Deciding to not watch Mercy until I finished the book,I got set to meet the absent ones.The plot:At an office party,police officer Carl Mørck is approached by an old man who asks if Mørck's Department Q has look into the cold case related to the death of his children. Feeling uneasy round him, Mørck gets the guy thrown out. Later that night, Mørck learns that the man has killed himself. Regretting his words, Mørck and fellow officer Assad open the files on the dead man's twins,and discover a murderous class from twenty years ago, who are now in the top class of society.View on the film:Going back and forth over 20 years, the screenplay by Nikolaj Arcel & Rasmus Heisterberg gaze upon the ""murderous boarding school"" sub- section of the Giallo genre,where the students are taught a vicious Noir arrogance that is left to fester for 20 years. Along with the school antics giving their Jussi Adler-Olsen adaptation a visceral edge,the writers strike the present with a deep Nordic Noir pessimism,as Mørck and Assad's investigation leads to an intense unlocking of the business elite (a major theme of the genre) ) that sets alight a superb,grim final page for Department Q.Looking towards the Giallo,director Mikkel Nørgaard & cinematographer Eric Kress take advantage of the school setting for a slice of sleaze,via the fading gold colours of the flashbacks being torn with naked girls,masked thugs and deep red blood being rubbed on the screen. Limiting any bright lights to the past, Nørgaard makes the teams investigation one that smashes the pristine glass world of the killers,to expose the moulding blacks and greens under the surface. Years before putting on the mild-manner business glasses of Simon in Follow the Money,David Dencik gives a wonderful, uncomfortably meek performance as Ulrik Dybbøl,whilst Sarah-Sofie Boussnina gives an excellent,ticking time bomb performance as Kimmie. Attemping to learn what took place 20 years ago, Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Fars Fares give great,burnt-out,Nordic Noir loner performances as Mørck and Assad,who both meet the chosen ones."
" excellent
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,10,"Excellent acting through out, once you have seen the three in this series you will be crying out for more.You are on the edge of your chair willing the team to try this approach that approach. When you think they have them up pops another problem. Sad ending for the girl but one hopes this trio go on to make more of this entertaining shows"
" Second in the Scandi-noir trilogy
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,6,"THE ABSENT ONE is the second in the trilogy of DEPARTMENT Q films, Danish crime dramas based on novels. This Scandi-noir offering has all you'd expect from this particular genre: dark visuals, a gritty plot, a sinister back story that impinges on the present day, and some scruffy, downbeat detectives who refuse to give up the case no matter what.This film features an extensive back story involving a group of public school teenagers who get up to some dark deeds in the 1990s. It's hard-hitting and explicit stuff indeed, and the present-day storyline is just as intensive. These DEPARTMENT Q films benefit from strong production values, solid writing, good acting, and a general air of quality that makes them ones to watch for fans of the genre."
" Good Danish crime mystery
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,8,"Mystery thriller from Denmark like there should be more. The movie has everything you need to make a good Film Noir. A well chosen cast with good actors, a story line that doesn't reveal everything at once with intriguing plots, a dark ambiance. Those are the movies that I usually remember because you can remember every detail because you paid attention to the captivating story. Unlike other movies that you forget everything about after a couple days. I didn't know any of the actors and they are probably just known in their country but you really can't fail any of them because they did an excellent job. I already saw a couple really good movies from Denmark and this is one of them."
" Department Q – The Absent One
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,9,"Some time has passed since Department Q's one and only successful case and now Carl and Assad feel that there is pressure on them to get results. Carl is approached by a former police officer whose children had been murdered twenty years previously; Carl refuses as the case was officially solved. The man then commits suicide so Carl feels driven to at least take a look it isn't long before he feels that there is more to the case than immediately met the eye. Firstly the man who was jailed for the crime was defended by one of Denmark's most expensive lawyers who only works for the country's richest families and this man was hardly rich and secondly he only served a short sentence for a crime as serious as a double murder where one of the victims was raped. There is also a recording that suggests that the crime was witnessed. Carl and Assad start to try to track down this witness but it soon becomes clear that others are determined to ensure they fail. It seems highly likely that those involved were students at a prestigious boarding school but the chief suspects are now respected businessmen and before the case is over Carl and Assad will be in extreme danger.This was a solid second case for Department Q although it is obvious who was responsible from near the start; the only real question was whether they would be brought to justice and if so how. There is quite a lot of violence; much of it brutal, some of it sexual in nature, which at times makes it feel more like a horror film than a detective drama I've certainly seen some 'infamous' horror films that were less brutal! This will probably be a bit too much for some viewers but others will feel it adds to the intensity of the drama. Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Fares Fares continue to impress as Carl and Assad and Danica Curcic does a fine job as Kimmie, the witness everybody is trying to find. Pilou Asbæk and David Dencik are also on great form as two particularly unpleasant suspects. Overall I'd say that while this certainly won't be for everybody I'd recommend it to anybody who enjoyed the previous film in the series."
" Decent crime tale, less mystery than its predecessor but much more darker, obscene and gruesome than the first.
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,8,"Saw this recently on a rented DVD. This is the follow up to the Keeper of lost causes. In this film, both Nikolaj n Fares need to solve another case because some time has passed since the success of their first case and their reputation is going down. A bereaved ex-cop appeals to Nicolaj to solve the murder of his two children. The ex cop kills himself after being refused. Feeling guilty, our two cops begin looking into the case, with all leads initially pointing towards an elite boarding school. Their search for the truth takes them in some unexpected places n a bandaged nose. Nicolaj after being attacked, gets a bandaged nose, a nod to Jack Nicholson's character from Chinatown. The plot may not be new or there may not be enuff mystery but the movie was captivating to hold your interest till the end. It's much more darker, obscene and gruesome than its predecessor. Its more of a crime tale n less of a mystery. Found it to be a lil disappointing because its not in the same league as its predecessor specially when it comes to suspense n tension. This film has lots flashbacks like the first one. Nonetheless it got saved by strong performances by all. Fares gave a very good performance n Nikolaj too gave a nice performance. A decent police procedural crime tale."
" Entertaining but overlong
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,5,"The second movie based on the Department Q's novels is an entertaining affair, but with zero originality and too long to really satisfy.A drunken man jumps into the path of Carl Mørck when he is going home and asks him about some documents he sent him. Carl ignores him and tells the drunken man to go home. A couple of hours later, the man is death, having committed suicide. On a table, a box with lots of information he had been gathering through the years. The man was a retired policeman, and the case he was talking about the death of his two children. Carl Mørck becomes obsessed with finding the truth.""The Absent One"" is not a bad movie. It has good atmosphere, a nice pace and the acting passes the bar. We will care for Assad and Carl, a couple of policemen with very different personalities that compliment each other (of course). However, the movie relies too much on flashbacks to explain parts of the story and how the events unfolded. On top of that, there is little mystery and the level of tension could have been higher: we have seen too many times the story of straight policemen trying to catch very bad very rich people that have too many friends in the right places. This doesn't stop, though, the movie from being absorbing enough. It will probably be enjoyed the best by fans of the books or the genre."
" watchable at best
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,5,"if you expect another take at a ""Girl with a dragon tattoo"" kind of movie, you'll be tremendously disappointed. the mystery and mood are gone, you know the ending right after it begins, and the only question that hangs throughout entire film is whether you should keep on watching it.it's such a cheap rip off I'm amazed Danish folks rushed to the cinemas as they reportedly did. there's nothing really good about this one, acting's very average, main characters aren't very likable and are not developed well, the whole 'who killed them' mystery is solved instantly after showing the main villain - and you'll know it's him because.. well unless it's your first movie ever, you just will.it's a very, very average movie at best."
