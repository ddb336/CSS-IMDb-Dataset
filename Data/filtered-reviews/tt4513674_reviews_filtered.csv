" Regular but cute...
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,7,"I liked it, fun, adorable... I found the rhythm a little slow, the narration always helps, not to get lost in space time, but the story could captivate more, a little dragged, but cute, it lacked a little bit of chemistry, despite being a fan of the two... Jesse Eisenberg s2 Kristen..."
" Good, I recommend it
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,"Interesting, entertaining to watch, but also with a surprisingly fresh ending."
" Pointless and dull
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,3,Boring beyond belief. Most characters are mere caricatures who are wholly unlikeable and face few obstacles in this campy period pic. I was struck by how abrupt the ending seemed but that shouldn't have surprised me in a film with so little conflict and almost no plot.If not for Eisenberg this wouldn't even rate 3/10 stars but even his charm can't save this. Stewart and Lively are the worst big Hollywood actresses of the last 20 years.
" Who Cares?
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,2,"Poor Woody knew he had to crank something out to keep him on track so he penned this pot boiler while make morning tea. The three principals are people I didn't care a brass farthing about. No sympathy for any of them. The old guy leaves his wife for the spunky secretary who is maybe in love with the mousey newby in town (glitzy 30's Hollywood)...yawn....then the second half back in London where it takes place mostly in a cafe where society congregates and therefore a movie title is born...yawn...So a couple of years later everyone connects again and we hope it doesn't go too far altho lust and passion and red roses intervene. Then one night the movie ends. Will it doesn't quite end, it just fades to black and credits roll so I guess it just stopped. Anticlimactic. All in all the cars and clothes are impressive and some nice hair styles and jewelry too but the story sucks."
" No more Eisenberg pls
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,4,"Woody does Gatsby, and it's a pretty good watch. Eisenberg takes some getting used to as the Woody figure, but he does a serviceable job. It's in the top five of best looking films Woody has ever made. This gets so many stars because we've come to expect less life out of his films as he gets older and this one has some vibrancy. This doesn't get more stars because the script feels like it was cranked out in a week, like so many of his late period movies."
" The Dying Light
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,3,"A movie which is not about ""cafe society"".
Those acquainted with sports understand that an elite athlete makes the greatest amount of money at the end of his (or her) career - when their skills are at their lowest ebb.
Amazon closed a monster production deal with Woody Allen before backing out due to political heat, but that financial windfall was an indicator of how highly regarded he is even when most of us can see how so, so, so tired his material has become.
Like an old casserole your favorite aunt pulls out of the back of the frig.
Sure, you liked it when you were a kid - but this one is just a bunch of stuff thrown together without rhyme or reason - and every few forkfuls you can taste some mold.
The theme (if you can call it that) is one that Allen returns to again and again: romantic indecision.
We want something (or someone) until we have it - then don't want it so much - then want it even more when having it seems impossible.
It's a recipe for consistent misery and Allen's on record as saying that life itself is mainly miserable and he doesn't understand how most people get through the day.
On the other hand, one of the pleasures of this late stage of Allen's career is: he can get any player he wants and Kristen Stewart - an actress I can't get enough of - is on screen for significant lengths of time.
She's miscast in this movie, as almost everyone else is - and eventually she'll have to start playing grown-ups - but it's always a pleasure watching her."
" Well written, expertly directed and acted
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,8,"This is not for someone who hates Woody Allen movies. But then if that's the case, why here reading these reviews? A taste for masochism? ; )If I were to look for a flaw in this movie it is that it's so realistic it almost fails to be a movie. The writing, directing and acting are all superb. The sets are very well done, bringing that era of time to modern-day reality... and making it believable. Some may not enjoy the slow-burner nature of the film. There are those who will find it boring and a little cliche (which it certainly is). Such viewers should probably avoid Woody Allen movies... because they're fairly predictable in nature and content.This is a movie about a man's first love and how that encounter affects his and his girlfriend's lives thereafter. There's nothing exceptional here; no climax, no morality play. It's a lengthy slice-of-life movie that viewers may not understand... unless they've gone through that kind of experience. I can't elaborate without spoilers. A person gets the ending or they don't. Either way, it's a captivating portrayal.If there is any lesson here, it's that life seldom pans out the way one expects or wishes. Even when it's good we mess with ourselves, mess with others, delude ourselves and others, and wind up exactly where we brought it. That's the message of this movie, but interestingly enough it's a point made with a feather duster rather than a hammer. It is the subtlety of the film that makes it worthwhile. Don't look for answers in this film; it's tricky enough figuring out the question. Viewers both sympathize and criticize the characters throughout... just as we do with ourselves.I'm not a Woody Allen ""fan""; some movies are good, some not so good. This one was a mildly entertaining surprise that might leave the audience thinking about where we ourselves have been, and how we've arrived where we are.I can't rate this a 10-star ""one of the best movies ever made""; it doesn't stack up to that. But it achieved its intended purpose with expertise seldom seen in movies these days and is overall well done."
" Based on a nice premise but...
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,8,"This movie would be much better presented if Kristen Stewart didn't act in it. She killed the atmosphere in every scene she was in. Besides, the film has a charming Woody Allen spirit"
" Lacks Usual Woody touch
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,6,"All cast hugely miscast. Particularly Jesse Eisenberg & Kristin Stewart not believable in their roles. The effect of changing time - Film takes place during several years - almost unrecognizable. Even the usual great Steve Carrell sounds like he's not fully convinced in his character or the story arc.
Yes, there are some great touches of Woody Allen lines (""Christianity has more customers"") but overall, movie gives the impression of hastily produced."
" A good movie and I'm not a Woody Allen fan.
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed the movie and understand the ending... because who hasn't thought of a former lover, missed them deeply, and realized the love for them endures."
" Terrible waste of time
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,2,"The high point is the great music. The acting was somewhat OK, but the story was boring, uninteresting, sick, and had no redeeming qualities. For a great Woody Allen movie, watch Midnight in Paris. Cafe Society is awful."
" FRESH AND BITTERSWEET MUSING ON THE ROAD NOT TAKEN
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,10,"A superb cast, lush sets, spectacular cinematography, compelling story and the best musical score in years - this film has everything. 10/10"
" Enjoyable
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,8,"Having grown up with Woody Allen classics like Annie Hall, Manhattan etc, one has high expectations of any Woody Allen film, and despite Woody reaching 80 years old, I still expect a good solid movie... And I think this one does the job well. Not as sharp and deep as other movies he's written, directed and starred in, it still has a great deal going for it, and Woody's style is recognisable in the characters, writing and wit.Jesse Eisenberg performs very well and you can see him being a great replacement for Woody now Woody is well past his sell by date on playing the romantic leads, and also he makes a great change from some of the chunky hunks of other more recent Allen movies. Much more believable and much better handled. I don't have any issue with him sounding a bit like Woody or having some of the mannerisms, as I think the script drives those to a large extent, and it fits!Vonnie played by Kristen Stewart is really good too, and is certainly great as the younger Secretary Vonnie in Hollywood. She is a little less convincing as her character develops over the years.And Steve Carell seems to breeze through his role, totally comfortable and a little understated at times.Photographically - excellently done too, some great scenes and some great close-ups and viewpoints fro shooting some of the more poignant or intimate moments. A usual with Woody Allen films there are also great family interplays showing again his understanding and commentary on American family life in days gone by.Overall, an impressive and likeable movie creating a great atmosphere of the 1930s era. And as for Woody Allen, he can still bash out a great film, well done him!"
" Film average, take away profound
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,6,"No chemistry between Jesse and Kristen (actually Jesse barely showed up, pretty dismal to be honest).
And yet,
The ending, if you have this in your life, well then, it's devastating to think, feel, live this..."
" Visual delight
",2019-08-23 00:00:00,9,"This movie is beautifully shot, the play of colours, lighting, angles and setting is an absolute treat for the eyes. Eisenberg and Stewart have good chemistry, something that is not easily found in current movies. This is the most beautiful Stewart has looked in a movie, it feels as if you are effortlessly transported to the 1930's. Good acting by Eisenberg, Stewart and Carell."
" No story!
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,2,"Boring. Not going to be remembered as one of woody's best work. No story, no drama average performances no great lines which woody is so good at"
" Beautiful but forgettable
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,7,"This movie is beautiful. The shots are very well placed. The lighting and colour palettes were extremely appealing. The dialogue was quirky but fun to listen to. The acting is good, direction is good. However, most films with this topic base leave you either incredibly thoughtful, happy or sad. Maybe if you are experiencing similar things as the characters then you'll get more from this film. However, it mostly left me feeling incredibly empty and I'll possibly forget about it."
" Not great, not terrible
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,7,"It is a movie worth watching, though it is not as good as some other Woody's works. The main character is (of course) actually Woody and here we have again usual Woody's elements: Jewish culture, thinking about death and love affairs. It is specific the plot is placed around 1930 and the accompanied scenography is really great. Acting is fair decent and music is let's say standard Allen's pick.
I personally don't like neither Kristen, nor Blake, but I can praise their acting, especially Kristen's. Jesse is also good, but I don't find Steve to fit this role too much."
" dreamy romance movie
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,7,"""Dreams are dreams.""This is the first Woody Allen film I've ever seen. Café Society is about a young New Yorker who moves to Hollywood with hopes of obtaining some of his uncle's glamor and status. He meets and falls in love with his uncle's secretary, and a love triangle soon develops.I figured I would enjoy this movie because I was impressed by the cast on the front cover. Jesse Eisenberg is always bound to put up a good performance, and this one is no different. Kristen Stewart, despite the hate she often receives, is also very good. I don't mind her at all as an actress, and<Café Society really shines her in the best possible light (figuratively and literally speaking). In this one, she impresses me more than Eisenberg.I can see why someone wouldn't like this movie, but it appeals to my interests. The story, characters, and script are all very poetic and quaint. The setting is amazing, and Allen succeeds in giving off a Golden Age kind of vibe. The cinematography and lighting are beautiful. They offer a dreamlike look which matches the overall theme of the film.This is a film I'd definitely be open to watching again. It tells the story of love, lost love, and love that just isn't meant to be. Sure it's clichéd, sure it's not everyone's type, but it's entertaining through and through."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,3,"I went into this movie knowing nothing other than it's a comedy with steve carell and jesse eisenberg. i was relatively into it for a while but it's very boring and the story is just stupid love triangle drama. also, it was barely funny. there were some things that made me smile but almost nothing that made me laugh (1 viewing)"
" Ok
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,6,"Great cast! Easy to follow light hearted romance set in 1930's. Engaging story line but the film did not seem to come to a conclusion, just ended abruptly, was left unsatisfied."
" You either get it or you dont
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,8,"In my humble opinion most Woody Allen movies have a feel but some you can feel more than others and I do believe this is one of those stronger ones. Im sure it has something to do with the beautiful cinematography, scenery and costumes but also the love story was just so believable and Jessie Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart were just so genuine. Funny I don't normally even like those two actors but put them in a Woody Allen movie and it's a whole new performance. Lastly, I couldnt help but notice that most reviews on here are really good or really bad and that's most likely because you either get his movies or you don't. And I really got this one."
" A painting... but
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,6,"Really nice pic of the thirties.
Beautiful paintings but... something is missing the creepy family deserved more...
They were funny but not important enough it seems"
" Boring as hell but also beautiful
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,4,"I found the story very dull, I could not even achieve the ""suspension of disbelief"" that is required to enjoy a movie. I got a lot more involved with some episodes of Peppa Pig.
This said, the photography and recreation of the historical period are marvellous. Just for this the film is worthy, you feel like saving frames to print out and hang on a wall all the time."
" Seriously boring and pointless
",2019-03-28 00:00:00,3,"This is such a pointless film. Even Stewart couldn't save it, but she was fantastic I think and enjoyable to watch her on it."
" Please somebody explains this film to me.
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,1,"This film was one of those films that I had to really try to focus on watching otherwise I would've easily left my couch to do something else. Throughout the film, little things happened and at the same time nothing really happened. It's like everyone's boring life. And if this film is about showing how usual and boring a life can be, then I would rate it 10 but for that purpose we don't need a film, do we? We could just simply see the reality for that. Please someone tell me what was good about this film."
" Just ok
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,6,"Just an ok movie, but still glad I gave it a watch. Any time I get to see Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart light up the screen together is time well spent, even if the movie itself is a bit lacking. Entertaining throughout, but it left me with a bit of an empty feeling inside. Watch it if you love Eisenberg or Stewart, or Steve Carell, Blake Lively, or Parker Posey."
" Logics of Adultery
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,10,"Woody Allen is a director skilled in his ability to reveal the beauty of women. Throughout the film the female cast looks so natural and gorgeous. Of course, costume and music help in this regard. Bobby's character seems to embody or, at least, reflect a good deal of Woody Allen's persona. In some scenes Jesse Eisenberg (Bobby) has a tendency to broaden his character. The film ''Café Society'' is free from political connotations or military underscore, although scenes of violence are present. However, there are no cracked heads or draining brains. Likely, it is a general feature of Woody Allen to be ironic in presenting murder scenes, eliminating terrifying violence and making these scenes a bit comic. All the time he is trying to focus on the storyline. And this is about the nature of human relations and, particularly, extramarital affairs. Woody Allen explicates the logic of adultery, and it seems at the conclusion an extramarital affairs is good, when it does not affect the family or business."
" A quirky 1930's showbiz dramedy think La La Land but in the 30's and not a musical.
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,8,"Cafe Society is the first film with Woody Allen associated with it I've seen unless you count Antz and he is fantastic with the offbeat comedy and drama. It follows a young man named Bobby (Jessie Eisenberg) as he moves to Hollywood to get a job from his uncle (Steve Carell) who is a Hollywood producer and falls in love with Veronica ""Vonnie"" (Kristen Stewart) as he slowly gets more connections and rises to more importance. The film is funny and upbeat with an excellent 30's jazz filed soundtrack, great performances, and hilarious bits thrown in amongst a slightly boring and predictable but well directed and acted period piece comedy about showbiz. 8.5/10"
" Uninteresting, Slow
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,3,"The movie had the typical expected rhythm of a Woody Allen movie. Jessie Eisenberg=a boring, unattractive, hunchbacked waste of space.
 I couldn't feel any connection with ANY the players, even though one of my favorite actresses (Parker Posey) was in this film. She played her role well enough as she usually does. But the movie just seemed to be a cheap rip off of other movies, including some earlier (better) Woody Allen movies. It wasn't funny. It wasn't suspenseful. It wasn't compelling. It was a long. I got bored of looking at Kristen Stewart pointy chin, and inexpressive face. The movie had very little charm and didn't tell a great story. Would not recommend it to anyone. But if it helps, it was also largely predictable."
" Bad ending
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,3,I usually don't write reviews but this was the worst MOVIE ENDING OF ALL TIMES! Thanks ! Bye!
" Great movie, decent story
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,8,"This is a great movie. Far better than I expected; I'm not the biggest fan of movies set in the past, though.
It's a great mix between drama and comedy, I would definitely buy this on DVD if I should find it.
But I just don't get why it's taking place in the 1930's, in my opinion the movie would be just as good if it took place in out time.
And, again in my opinion, I feel that Steve Carrell is slightly miscast in that role, I'd prefer someone like John C. McGinley or someone like that instead.
But otherwise it's a great movie.
I'd give it 80%, or 8/10."
" Thoroughly entertaining.
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,7,"Jesse Eisenberg is extremely fitted to play the Woody Allen character in Woody Allen films. Neurotic, frantic, and deeply awkward, Eisenberg fits the role to a tee and plays it to perfection in Cafe Society. As with all of Allen's films, it explores the nature of love and philosophy, makes fun of those who philosophize, offers social commentary on Judaism, and rubs shoulders with the upper crust of society. As with most of his films, it is certainly laced with witty dialogue, fun characters, and great acting. Led by Eisenberg, he once more shows that he has terrific chemistry with Kristen Stewart. The rest of the cast is up to par, especially Blake Lively. Additionally, the cinematography is really good and gives the film this dreamlike atmosphere that perfectly captures the similarities between LA and New York. Woody Allen remains witty and great at creating realistic and touching romances, while blending in religion and social commentary. Though not rising to the quality of his best films, Cafe Society is a sweet, seductive, and charming little romantic comedy that may be a bit slight, but remains thoroughly entertaining."
" ANOTHER WOODY ALLEN FORMULA MOVIE
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,3,"This is the same as every other Woody Allen movie. Even the central character, played by Eisenberg, is a young neurotic jewish man. Eisenberg's portrayal of this role is as if he has just cloned Woody Allen, which I found very annoying."
" Worth seeing but underachieves
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,6,"Woody Allen is always magnificent at two things: writing dialog and directing small, intimate scenes. And both of those talents are on display here. However where he can stumble is building individual scenes into an overall narrative or plot, and that is the big problem with ""Café Society"". It is a series of interesting scenes that resolutely refuse to gel into a real story. The theme of ""things just happen"" is often important to Allen's movies. ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" turns it into a real virtue as a storytelling device. However here (and in some other of Allen's later-period movies) things just stumble along as though hoping to find meaning or resolution, and when they don't, the film sort of gives up with a shrug.The cinematography, set design, costumes, art direction and other visual aspects are all top-notch. The period details are nicely handled and immerse you into the time frame. There were only a couple of glaring anachronisms in the script, which most people won't catch. And the acting, top to bottom, was no less than ""good"", and often great, with even Eisenberg's Woody Allen impersonation working pretty well. Blake Lively and Kristen Stewart were both remarkably charming in their roles, while Steve Carell, given little to do, did little.Overall, worth a viewing as a piece of fluff, but don't expect that it will be up there with any of Allen's major works, or even mid-level. An evening of light entertainment that will soon be forgotten."
" Wrong era

" Bad.
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,4,"What can only be described as a wandering, aimless exploration of a story with no emotional resonance to speak of. Saved by good (though clearly overrated, judging by the number of reviews lauding it) cinematography and a nostalgic set, this movie is weakest in its writing, which is an excruciating combination childish simplicity and unbearable pretension. The score in this film was easily one of the worst ever put to the screen, and it was repeated, like clockwork, over and over again even in the middle of scenes. Steve Carell and Kristen Stewart did the best with what they had given this atrocious screenplay, but the male lead was horrendously miscast and Blake Lively gives one of the worst performances of her normally solid career. To paraphrase a review from a Seattle (I think) journalist I thought summed up this movie best, this film could best be described as a half-assed reboot of itself."
" Weak, and not just because Kristen Stewart is involved
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,4,"LA, 1930s. Phil Stern is a Hollywood mega-agent, making huge deals involving the cream of the celebrity world. His nephew, Bobby, travels to LA from New York to meet Phil in the hope of getting a job. After getting a bit of a run-around from Phil, Bobby eventually works for him. He also starts a relationship with Veronica, Phil's secretary. Unfortunately her heart belongs to someone else...Phil.Quite weak, and one of Woody Allen's worst movies (To Rome With Love is still THE worst Allen movie, however). Lifeless plot that just seems to meander in aimless, predictable fashion. Hardly any of the trademark Woody Allen humour.Even worse are the lead performances. We know by now that Kristen Stewart can't act and here she doesn't prove us wrong. However, she is not the worst of it. Jesse Eisenberg tries to channel a young Woody Allen and misses by a mile. Allen's performances in the 70s were charming in their neuroticism, glamourlessness and nerdiness. Eisenberg's performance has no charm, just dullness and irritation.(The supporting cast aren't bad though, with Steve Carell and Jeannie Berlin the picks of the bunch.)The narration of Woody Allen doesn't help either. His voice sounds tired, almost like he didn't want to be there. Somebody needs to tell him that he is not obliged to narrate his own movies..."
" Life is a comedy written by a sadistic comedy writer
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,10,"The feature starts out introducing Phil Stern (Steve Carell), a millionaire Hollywood agent. His party is interrupted by a phone call from New York. His sister (Jeannie Berlin) lets him know Bobby (Jesse Eisenberg) hates his job and is coming out to California. After a few attempts, Bobby gets to meet Phil who takes care of him. Bobby is odd man out in a love triangle and returns to NY where he works a night club for his criminal brother Ben (Corey Stoll). The film has Woody Allen all over it. Jesse Eisenberg plays the Allen persona perfectly as his lines ooze and drip with subtle irony. The odd prostitute scene with Anna Camp, Leonard asking a man to turn down his radio, and the theological musings toward the end, and the spring-autumn romance is just a continuation of over-all Allen humor.The film starts about 1935, that is when ""The Woman in Red"" played in the theaters, although I don't think there is an effective time line going forward. Sadly, Eisenberg and Stewart create a different chemistry than what they had in ""American Ultra."" Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity."
" Good enough Cafe, though not great
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,7,"Woody Allen's latest showcase ""Cafe Society"" gets the Woody nostalgic fever again and travels back to Los Angeles in the 1930's. Jesse Eisenberg stars as Bobby, a young Jewish New Yorkan who moves to Los Angeles in hopes of finding success. Bobby reaches out to his estranged Hollywood mogul uncle named Phil Stern played by Steve Carell. Initially, Phil is very stern in helping Bobby get a foot in the door, but then he obliges to Bobby's request. There, Bobby falls for the beautiful Stern assistant Vonnie played by Kristen Stewart. Eventually, Bobby then gets caught up in ""bizarre love triangle"" that doesn't necessarily follow a ""new order"". Allen does a modest job in helming and scribing the picture, but this not in his elite of his film society bio. None of the performances were striking, but I must say that Stewart does the best work in her career here as Vonnie. I would get in the ""Cafe Society"" if I were you, but I would not trample anyone in doing so. **** Good"
" Woody Allen - Still The Master!
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,9,"'Café Society' is a yet another winner from The Legendary Woody Allen. And the predominant reason, being, his PASSION for telling Stories to this date. Allen delivers a charming, heartfelt Romantic-Comedy-Drama, that celebrates life & love.'Café Society' Synopsis: In the 1930s, a Bronx native moves to Hollywood and falls in love with a young woman who is seeing a married man.Woody Allen is a Master at his craft & 'Café Society' proves that fact right yet again. Allen's Writing delves into the lives of flawed human beings & how emotions can overcome us at all times. Its engrossing to see its underdog leading-man falter in life & love, only to realize that experiences define us, for better or worse. Allen's Screenplay is consistently engaging & offers humor in the most unexpected places. Typical Allen.Allen's Direction is excellent, as always. Even his Voice-Over work here almost throughout the film, is delightful. Vittorio Storaro's Cinematography is superb. Alisa Lepselter's Editing is crisp. The Art & Costume Design take us back in time & offer authenticity. Performance-Wise: Jeannie Berlin, Steve Carell, Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Corey Stoll and Ken Stott, all are up for vie top honors. Eisenberg channels vintage Woody with fascinating results, while Stewart oozes naturalness. Carell is effortless, as ever. Parker Posey stands out. Her body-language speaks in volumes.On the whole, 'Café Society' is a must see."
" Beautiful 1930's period piece film neatly directed by Woody Allen
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,9,"I watched this more out of curiosity more than anything else and found it surprisingly good. I was surprised since Woody Allen was 80-years-old when this came out in 2016. It's rare to do such fine work in any artistic endeavor at such an advanced age. Of course the opportunity to direct Kristen Stewart was no doubt an incentive. It could be that Woody wrote this years ago and only decided to turn it into a movie when he got the very talented Vittorio Storaro to do the cinematography. The co-incidence of uncle and nephew (unbeknownst to either one of them) falling in love with the same woman Vonnie (Stewart) was handled skillfully, especially the sequence of events that led to first Phil Stern (Steve Carell) and then Bobby (Jesse Eisenberg ) discovering their surprising rival.In addition to this being a beautiful film with a lot of pleasing 1930's era atmosphere it is also very cleanly directed by the old master. There is no clutter, virtually everything in the plot is necessary and I was pleased with the realistic treatment of love sadly lost, and then the possibility of it being rekindled as an illicit affair, and then Well, I won't say. See the movie. It's definitely worth watching.One more thing: Kristen Stewart at 26 was as pretty as pretty can be.--Dennis Littrell, author of the movie review book, ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote"""
" Is that the end of Woody Allen?
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,5,"Watching ""Café Society"" was such a depressing and frustrating experience I couldn't believe I ""owed"" it to Woody Allen. But on second thoughts, it makes sense because only a director of his caliber, one who accustomed us to thought-provoking and/or heart-warming gems of originality, could heighten our expectations so high they would literally smash into deception, breaking in thousand pieces of disbelief. That's how I felt when the film ended, it wasn't even bad, it was just a lame and lackluster attempt to explore all the usual shticks for a plot so vacuous it wasn't even ""interestingly"" bad.The story? In a nutshell (and I mean a very small one), a young New Yorker named Bobby (Jesse Eisenberg) wants to work in Hollywood for his uncle, a rich and famous producer (that's for the pleonasm) named Phil Stern (Steve Carell). Phil has a mistress, his secretary Vonnie (Kristen Stewart), naturally, Bobby falls in love with her, the resulting triangle cannibalizes the first act until Vonnie picks Phil and we can't even tell if she chose him like she meant it. Never mind, a defeated Bobby goes back to his Big Apple of a hometown, and with the help of his gangster brother, he opens a restaurant, meets a young woman (Blake Lively), they marry and have a kid. Bobby meets Vonnie again, she's married, they share a romantic night in Central Park. Then they get back to their lives and the film ends with the two of them feeling alone.I could mention that there's a criminal subplot supposed to spice the film a little, but you might as well throw a pinch of salt and pepper on Lake Ontario. One could say that it's not ""what"" happens but the way it happens. Sorry, but even the treatment couldn't have been worse if it was someone trying to imitate Allen. Each element of the story is a poor man's version of what he did before, and better. The real love letters to Hollywood and show business were ""Broadway Danny Rose"", ""The Purple Rose to Cairo"" and ""Bullets Over Broadway"". The bittersweet romance is an Allen staple ever since ""Annie Hall"" and ""Manhattan"", the Jewish family element has never been as endearing as in ""Radio Days"". There's not a single element that doesn't feel like we've seen it before.But even then, it would have been acceptable if it these ersatz were half as good as their originals. Woody Allen has lost his touch on this one, so bad it hurts. Eisenberg tries desperately to make an impression of Allen in his early scenes, falling in a similar trap than Kenneth Branagh in ""Celebrity""... why all the actors feel the need to impersonate Alvy Singer when they're in a Woody Allen film? Now, Kristen Stewart isn't bad but the role is rather unflattering, she just plays a secretary who goes from being an unpretentious free-spirited girl above the 'starlet' mentality, to a sophisticated socialite. In between, she's torn between the two men and you can tell she tries to get rid of that awkward 'puzzled' expression inherited from the 'Twilight' series. You can tell that for youngsters Eisenberg and Stewart, working with Allen was a wet dream, but I wonder if they were really pleased to play such bland and dull roles. Even Steve Carell isn't given many scenes to shine, everything is handled in a casual, peaceful and matter-of-factly way. And if the romance is toned down and subdued, Allen insists on the ethnic element more than needed. Allen has always been a window to New York Jewish culture, but talk about overplaying it. If another director made the same film, let alone a Gentile, this would have been raised a big polemic and even accusations of stereotypical portrayals.I always laugh at Allen's references to a nagging Jewish mother figure or his interaction with his rabbi, this is one of the defining elements of Allen's humor, just like self-derision is prevalent in Jewish humor, but in ""Café Society"", it is overused to the point of pointlessness. So, the producer is Jewish, the nephew works for his father, a Jeweler, named Marty, his mother is a version of Julie Kavner after she went in a dryer, overcooking food because of germ-phobia and uttering Yiddish expressions just in case we forgot. Even the prostitute in Hollywood, happens to be Jewish. I swear there are more ethnic references in ""Café Society"" than all of Woody Allen's movies combined. That critics would point it this characteristic in an Allen film can give you an idea of how serious it is.We would have guessed Bobby's background without it be thrown to our faces every forty-seven seconds. If it was a religious film à la ""A Serious Man"" (the underrated masterpiece from the Coen Brothers) it would have made sense, but here, it was uncalled for. This insistence from Allen on elements of the background while the plot was devoid from the usual excitement and creativity left me puzzled. I didn't know if I had to be angry or sad, but I guess I'm worried. I felt like Allen lost his touch and could only rely his story on (another) nostalgic letter to Hollywood, New York and his Jewish roots. In fact, there's a well-meaning intent behind ""Café Society"", but I felt like an over-nostalgic, maybe melancholic (or mildly senile) Allen made it.2016 wasn't the best year for homage to old Hollywood anyway, both ""Café Society"" and the Coens's ""Hail Caesar"" were forgettable movies but they say a lot about the evolution of filmmaking, forcing directors to be reminiscent of good old days, ""La La Land"" did better without turning it into a period movie. I hope that excess of nostalgia doesn't mean Woody Allen lost his touch with the present. I hope this is just a misstep and that he has one or two masterpieces under his sleeve."
" Had a lot to work with but didn't hit the mark
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,4,"I'm no Woody Allen fanatic, but every one of his films I've seen I've found charming. Cinematography and soundtracks are dreamy, just like in Cafe Society, but it was just so horribly cast, I couldn't find myself ever wanting to see it a second time like I have with his others.I agree with a previous reviewer that Eisenberg seemed like Allen's younger alter ego, but this was just the worst. And Kristen Stewart just flopped terribly as well. I get Allen usually casts for mild-mannered, somewhat dorky leads, but this was awful. Eisenberg and Stewart as the leads in a gorgeously shot, somewhat cleverly written setting as this one was just such a sad, sad, borderline painful mistake to watch unfold. Steve Carrell as Phil was great as always and I loved Corey Stoll as Ben. I kept watching for those two characters specifically. I look forward to every new film Woody Allen puts out, I just hope he goes in a less painfully awkward direction after realizing that Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg as a lead love interest in a glamorous setting is laughable."
" Laugh Along With Their Immorality
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,2,"Cafe Society is a term used to describe an elite (shallow) group of wealthy and/or famous people who participate in social activities that are unreachable to ordinary people. This film mainly centers around (1) early Hollywood and (2) the main character's dysfunctional family.The leading actor is not a convincing innocent & all the characters have a debased & distorted view of personal morality.Unfortunately this movie provides clear evidence of anti-Christian bias on the part of the filmmakers.The mockery & derision of Christianity seems to be the prevalent norm among films being released by Hollywood,there are virtually no films with positive Christian portrayals.The protagonists brother Ben commits a murder and is given a sentence of capital punishment for his crimes,he converts to Christianity for its promise of an everlasting life after death. In the scene where the characters are discussing his decision and the concept of heaven, his Jewish mother states: ""First a murderer then a Christian? What did I do to deserve this""Blasphemous Posturing & Hostility Masquerading As Humour. 
The film industry in the USA have normalized what was once considered deviant and are defining as deviant what was once considered normal.Lower standards and moral relativism are promoted by movies like this. Deviant and normal have officially swapped places when it is acceptable humour to put Christians on a par with murderers"
" Awful
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,1,"This movie was terrible. Cardboard acting. Stilted dialogue. Unbelievable emotional dynamics forced by the plot. Characters and plot you don't care about. Annoying narration. I admit that even the very best Woody Allen movies only strike me as ""ok"", but this is an awful movie riding on legacy and betting on fans declaring the emperor's new clothes are genius. It did look sorta pretty....that's it."
" When a nihilistic comedian is your favorite movie maker...
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,8,"Woody Allen is a gem like none other in the history of cinema, his humor is not loved by all yet he is widely known and famous and even respected by many. His brand of humor can feel like a cheap slapstick that leaves you smirking to some awkward jokes and in turn seem like a failure but any veteran of his works knows that is just the outer shell of his movies and hide the real meat of the movie, its bitter humor and contempt towards the world and fantasies of perfect society or life. When I say bitter humor and contempt towards the world or use the word nihilist it doesn't mean that Woody Allen actually despises life all together, in fact in my opinion he very much enjoys his life and even in his movies you see that even his characters do enjoy their life in their own way, it just isn't your typical happy go lucky way of looking at the world.In his works time and time again his criticism towards the humanity's vanities are observed via his awkward jokes that are not really meant to make you burst out laughing but to make you think, really think and this movie is no different. In an ever more cautious and morally and politically correct world Allen's stories might seem ""offensive"", ""distasteful"", ""like flat champagne"" and ""weak"" but in truth he has not wavered from his age old mission: Entertaining the masses and making them think with a smile on their lips.This movie follows Bob as he moves to warm and sunny Hollywood from drab and grey New York to start a new adventure in his life and get into working in the movie industry one way or another. His goal is to get some help from his uncle who is a big man in Hollywood to get started, however he falls in love with the uncle's secretary and wouldn't you know it the secretary is the uncle's girlfriend. The story continues on and Bob after failing in his love life and career in Hollywood moves back to New York and gets successful and starts a family and life basically moves on for a while before he meets his old love again and basically ends with one of the biggest punches in the face a movie goer can receive from a comedy movie and that is the movie ending on a note that leaves you certain that no one got a ""happy ending"". As in Bob is married to a beautiful woman and has children and success but can not stop thinking about the love that never went anywhere and you know this will eat at him forever and the same for Veronica who is married to an older successful man but will never be able to get over Bob and will never be truly happy. This is yet again the nihilistic side of Woody Allen coming out to play. We have seen this side in many of his films even in his most playful and mainstream works like ""Midnight in Paris"" we see him tearing down the feel good moments of its characters only to push them under the spot light of reality; and whether we like it or not the reality is that being obsessed with nostalgia in case of main character of ""Midnight in Paris"" does not make for a good life but at least in that movie the character gets a happy ending after going through a serious but mild wake up call. Here we get to really taste that sour and bitter taste of real life that even ""Irrational man"" with its ending didn't create. What I really enjoy with Woody Allen movies is the atmosphere and this movie had plenty of it and it was very dynamic. At the start of the movie New York is depicting as drab and grey, the colors are cold and washed out, the warmest you get is when you are watching scenes of the family home. Hollywood is warm and bright and colorful in a contrast to New York with its washed out colors and whenever Bob is with Veronica the colors are vivid and beautiful but when you hit the second half and Bob returns to New York you start to see New York becoming more colorful and colors pop out and are warmer even when depicting stuff like a body being shot with a gun. As per the usual of Allen's movies great jazz fills the movie with even more atmosphere and character. Jesse Eisenberg while not Woody Allen is very good at playing the part of that kind of character albeit with less charm. I don't know what happened to the charming Jesse Eisenberg of Zombieland but he holds it back most of the time. Kristen Stewart as Veronica is not unlikable but it is Kristen Stewart and Twilight shadow will forever loom above her head and it doesn't help that yet again in this movie she has to choose between two lovers. Steve Carell is believable as that prick of an uncle that we come to know through the movie and some might have a hard time with accept him in serious roles but that is not my case, I enjoy his serious roles even more than his comedic ones.I saw a criticism of the movie's depiction of Jews as down right offensive and was amused by the idea that even a Jew director and a Jew actor can not tell a story without being called offensive and insensitive to Jews.All in all the movie is fun and leaves you thinking about the consequences of your actions or lack of actions and while it could have a bit better pacing and some what better acting from Eisenberg and Stewart it is still another Allen movie that in my humble opinion is better than any thing else released in 2016 by the American film industry."
" Boring!!!!
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,1,"I could have spent the 1h 35 minutes length of this movie watching the traffic moving by from my living room window and be more entertained! Boring is the only word I can come up to describe this movie. Really, go take a walk, browse the web, check some kittens on Facebook...it all will be more meaningful in the end than watching this trite, soapy, stereotyped, boooriiiiiing movie! BTW...I used to love Woody Allen movies, but now I think he just keeps making movies because he can, although he has nothing left to show us! Boring! No redeeming qualities, boring! Did I mention how boring this movie is?"
" A blue story that says a lot but also leaves some things unsaid
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"There's not really a 'typical' Woody Allen movie because there are so many of them and they're all so much alike that they're all typical, except maybe 'Match Point'.'Café Society' has its similarities to Allen's other movies, and some dissimilarities, too. The similarities: the protagonist is Jewish, the movie explores identities of cities, there's a love triangle and infidelity, it resembles a stage play, it's a comedy but has some sad material, there's no villain, it stars a beautiful young star (Kristen Stewart joins Emma Stone, Scarlett Johansson, Evan Rachel Wood, Hayley Atwell and Christina Ricci as a Woody Allen movie love interest) and it has many unpredictable twists and is rather fast-paced.The dissimilarities are harder to describe. 'Café Society' feels somber, and it leaves much unresolved. It's not a neat little package like many Woody Allen movies are. Typically Woody characters talk way too much. 'Café Society' has things left unsaid. It's a very blue movie (fittingly in color scheme as well).It's about ambitions and priorities, and the winding roads of fate that take us to unexpected places. As usual, Woody Allen takes a setting and situation that seems distant and makes it easy to relate to.Bonus points for the scene with Anna Camp as a prostitute, that whole sequence was absolutely hilarious."
" Certainly better than La La Land
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,8,"It is not one of the best Woody Allen movies and the ending is a bit unsatisfying, lacking closure, but overall it is a very well done and well acted movie. The sets are great, the atmosphere, the actors are mixing their own thing into the film. Too bad that it doesn't do anything more than present a bit of L.A. life in the 1930s.I think the problem with it is that it tried to go too fast, sometimes replacing movie time with narration, which is normal for Allen, but rarely good. The core of the story is the love that people feel for each other and what it makes them do, yet it gets lost in all the noise.Bottom line: I don't think Woody Allen knew what this movie was supposed to say. It ended up being a love story caught in a slice of glamorous life in a world of movies and gangsters, but the two concepts fought each other rather than harmoniously coexist."
" The ONLY thing I don't admire about Woody Allen...
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,3,...is Jesse Eisenberg.I just don't get it.Ejected what was otherwise a beautiful film to look at after about 15 minutes of his high school play level performance. Especially painful after recalling Joaquin's 'Irrational Man' portrayal.I just don't get it.
" A movie of living one's dreams in a classic old school way with love and life and finding one's self!
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"I most of the time check out the movies of Woody Allen and I must say that most of them entertain and yes they are somewhat of a fairy tale type mostly paying tribute to places, and people and the past. Well with this entry ""Cafe Society"" it captures all of those themes so well as set in 1930's Hollywood this film is a journey a tale of romance and learning about people, love, and life. Bronx born Bobby(Jesse Eisenberg)travels to Hollywood to visit his uncle(Steve Carell)and along the way he falls in love with a young girl(Kristen Stewart)yet still Bobby is swept up in the vibrant world of night life of clubs, drinks, society, and beautiful women and the people of elegant and high class society life(also good turns are given from Blake Lively and Parker Posey). Still thru it all Bob's dreams have become to stand as a romantic test that will not die. Overall not the greatest still ""Cafe Society"" is a film to check out for it's classic dream tale of love and life in high society ""Hollywood""."
" Was This Movie Supposed to be Funny?
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,1,"Café Society follows a young man who, upon moving to Hollywood, meets a young woman whom he falls in love with, and the drama that ensues from that as Woody Allen narrates the whole thing. Let's start right there: Woody Allen's narration. It's a great way of getting out of actually writing characters. Why write conversations between characters to develop their chemistry, or even them as characters, when you can just narrate the fact that they fell in love? It's so much easier than putting in actual effort. As a result of Mr. Allen's 'efforts', these characters end up being exactly as you'd expect them, underdeveloped and uninteresting. In fact, the characters are so incredibly selfish that it's hard to like any of them. And yet the movie makes them out to be likable people whom we're supposed to get behind? I couldn't stand any of the major characters in this movie, and thus didn't care one bit about a single one of them. The reason I actually really wanted to see this movie was because of Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, whom I think have great chemistry together. In their other movies I've really enjoyed them as an on-screen couple, but they just couldn't do it in this movie. Eisenberg seemed to be trying, but he clearly wasn't too terribly invested in this role. As for Stewart, she sort of gave up in the third act. Sure, she wasn't really all that good throughout, but especially in the third act I saw a little bit of Bella from Twilight shine through. As for the rest of the cast, they're mediocre at best. I've been really impressed by Steve Carell as of late in dramatic roles, yet he clearly didn't care at all about this role. He's so bland, it's almost painful to watch. As for Blake Lively, she's hardly in the movie. An extra could have played her and nothing would've changed. Also, the soundtrack was so annoying. It's not that the music was bad, but just poorly used. It's like Allen or whoever was in charge of music couldn't compose more than one song, so that was all they used. And it was pretty generic music, it could have even been free range music that was just continuously looped. And yet, the worst part is that every single shot that used this music was identical. As a result much of the movie looked the exact same. 'Cue somewhat faraway shot of people getting out of some kind of vehicle' then 'cue generic piano tune' and then 'cue generic lighting'. It really did a number on the pacing, and my patience. This is a movie that, according to IMDb, is a comedy. My biggest question at this point becomes: how? Nothing about this movie was funny. It tried on occasion, I could tell. But those attempts were so futile, and they were based solely on one small aspect that could be humorous in how over-the-top it was. But it's hard to laugh when you're already snoring, especially because they're pulling the same joke that you've endured for an hour already. There's no variety, it's just the same 'joke' over and over. In Allen's attempt at dark humor, he ran out of ideas after one punchline and instead just kept using the same one. That, or he has Alzheimer's and forgot that he was using the same one over and over. As for the pacing, it's so long. Actually it's only 96 minutes, but it's so drawn out and boring. The first and third act are almost the same thing, and the second act is about ten minutes long so the movie basically repeats itself. Sure, it's not the same scene for scene, but the conflict is the exact same. And then it tries to force out some stupid conflict as the conclusion that comes out of nowhere and really has no relevance to most of the movie. Overall Café Society is atrocious. The performances are bland, the pacing is boring and drab despite that fact that the set crew left all the lights on during filming, the comedy is nonexistent, the characters are awful, and the movie as a whole is incredibly pretentious. It tries to paint itself as some down-to-earth movie about how horrible famous Hollywood people are, yet by the end that is exactly what it's about. Horrible, but famous, Hollywood people, and we're still expected to like these people. And one more thing: somebody sings at one point and it was probably the worst dub I have ever seen. After everything, that was enough to push me over the edge. In the end this is a terrible movie that I cannot not recommend enough. Do yourself a favor, and skip this film."
" Pointless movie from a tired old woody.
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,1,"What an utterly pointless movie this was. It's even pointless to say that this movie was pointless. It was that pointless. The lead character Jessie was portraying was pointless. The pointless romance they had with Kristen was pointless. Karell was pointless. The loudmouth neighbor was pointless and his pointless death delivered via the pointless mobster brother Ben was again, pointless...So we now know that Woody, that witty Woody that made us laugh and become awestruck at his genius simultaneously so many times over and over again has now become a very old, senile man that can hardly even do a POINTLESS speakover in a pointless movie. We now know that he still needs some money and so he tries to ride on his old waves and so he regurgitates this pointless, stale, piece of drab cinema so that for old times sake people will drop a few more pennies into his coffers. Pointless, really."
" Passable, inoffensive, forgettable...
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,6,"Cafe Society marked Woody Allen's first foray into digital filming and became, at $30 million, his most expensive film to date. There are times when the freedom of the digital medium, using a Sony CineAlta F65 camera, really aids his direction, the colour palette particularly well considered. It's decently cast, with Jesse Eisenberg one of the better Allen analogues of recent times, and yet it's just... okay. Woody Allen making movies that are ""just okay"" is something to get used to of late. In recent times he'd developed a more extreme stance, whereby one good movie would be followed by a stinker, and he could never seem to put together two decent projects in a row. Since his last good, arguably even great, movie, 2013's Blue Jasmine, Woody has put together three ""decent"" movies, nearly all of them forgettable, which does suggest that he's settling into even more of a comfort zone.2016's other big project was his first ""television"" series, the Amazon Prime six-parter ""Crisis In Six Scenes"". Allen himself admitted in interviews that he didn't know what he was doing and had regretted taking on the project. Had the series been put together as a film then it would have been his longest movie at around 135 minutes and would have been perhaps not as bad as they say, just, with a kind eye...... ""okay"".Cafe Society has occasional new territory, such as Eisenberg remarking on how his former beau (Kirsten Stewart) married his uncle, making her his aunt... a rare discussion of the complications of relations through marriage, something not unlike Ronan Farrow's quips on Twitter suggesting he calls Father's Day ""Brother-In-Law Day"". There are some flaws, such as Allen's use of voice-over narration... a nostalgic and touching addition to Radio Days, but here intrusive, and often just explaining the plot. The overriding feeling is that the script wasn't quite completed, and he felt the need to bridge the gaps, at one stage even giving us a scene without any audible dialogue.Ken Stott is an unlikely choice as a Jewish father, and Steve Carrell seems unable to breathe three-dimensionality into an underwritten part as the third cog in a love triangle. This can be excused, given that Carrell was cast on 28th August, 2015, sometime after the filming commenced on 17th August, a time when original actor Bruce Willis had had to leave, officially due to scheduling conflicts. Rather than a below-par performance by his own standards, Carrell can be looked on at helping to save the film at the last minute.Lastly, amongst all the traditional Allen fixations and conversations that have become incredibly, almost wearyingly familiar over the previous 40+ movies, there's the obsession with jazz. It's a fine line to walk, where the beauty of the music can add class to a film that warrants it, or make a dud seem pretentious. It's also unfortunate that Woody seems obsessed not with its bluesier underside or more experimental areas, but with Dixieland jazz, which is arguably the most trite of its forms."
" Tedious and pointless
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,4,"Some Woody Allen movies quickly draw me in, and some just as quickly repel me, but at first Cafe Society hit a middle ground, not entertaining, but not terrible.But as it went on without every seeming to develop a point, I started getting sick of it, only continuing because it felt like it must be ending soon. Then I checked the time stamp, and I'd only been watching for an hour and there was still over a half hour left. I thought, wow, that was one long hour.In the beginning, Cafe Society feels like it's going to be one of Allen's comedies, with Steve Carell as a bigwig and one of those messy Jewish families Allen likes to portray. It's not really that funny, but like an encounter with a prostitute that doesn't seem to have much purpose, it's funny-adjacent.But as the movie progresses, it becomes clear that it's really one of Allen's light dramas. Only while as a comedy it lacks jokes, as a drama it lacks heft. It's a bit like the short stories the New Yorker published in the 1980s; character studies that left you going, eh.One of the big issues with the movie is the main characters, Bobbie and Vonnie, both of whom lack passion for anything. Bobby decides to go to Hollywood because he simply can't think of anything else to do. Vonnie once had dreams, but she has decided against them. While the movie seems to believe this makes her a nice, simple, unpretentious girl, it really just makes her nothing; couldn't she have come up with some new goals? Bobby and Vonnie are nothings that Allen has inexplicably tried to build a movie around.The movie is very pretty, the non-Bobby/Vonnie characters are generally interesting, but the movie simply goes nowhere (I checked in wikipedia to see how it turns out, which only made me even happier than I had stopped watching).One last, relatively minor complaint: Allen's decision to narrate the movie himself was a terrible one. Yes, Allen can write elegant sentences, so he has a right to read them, but he speaks them like an elderly schlub. No director, including Allen, would audition a bunch of people to play the narrator and then choose Woody, and I can't imagine what Allen was thinking.But then, ""I can't imagine what he was thinking"" pretty much sums up my attitude to this movie."
" nothing new
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,5,"crossed lives, odd coincidences, shinning lives of super stars of Hollywood, Gangsters, Jewish belief ,But eventually I cant tell what was the main message of the movie? unhappy marriages? love between different ages? same class people understands each other well and can love better? for me , no and yes at the same time .the gangster elements were put in the film as different layer, their dresses, cars were different. it is in a sense that it try to give the message that today's Hollywood life or American high society life is built on the very crimes of gangsters. when watching, I was feeling that I am watching one of our ordinary life with more fancy and spice. Thus I wait the end of the movie with constant checking my watch. Maybe established and aged Woody Allen want to show us the life whole naked including the Hollywood stars."
" Didn't expect it to be this bad.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,5,"Whilst La La Land thrives through the storyline of the young couple facing reality, this narrative falls short coming off as try hard and unreal. Some arcs of the story, such the one with the prostitute, have no purpose and add nothing to the characters, although they were intended to. It doesn't help the fact that all characters are so unlikable either. Steve Carell makes some bold choices that look out of place (caricatured even) when acting alongside Kristen or Jesse in the beginning. As the time passes though, both of them grow to be more like Steve's character and we assume it happens because they were sucked in that empty world. This plot in itself has been explored several times before and (ironically) lacks depth, but had it been done a little more carefully it could look like less of a mess. Overall Woody Allen did a poor job not worth watching."
" ""And then, one evening, in walked the past...""
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,5,"Writer-director Woody Allen also narrates this handsomely-produced but otherwise lackluster romantic comedy-drama about tangled love relationships in Los Angeles and New York City in the 1930s. Jesse Eisenberg plays a nebbish from Brooklyn who travels to Hollywood to hopefully get a job with his uncle, a high-powered agent; once employed, he falls for his uncle's 25-year-old secretary, who is somewhat-seriously involved with the married boss. Allen hasn't lost his knack with snappy patter and intimate scenes of two characters in a romantic setting discussing their futures (while cinematographer Vittorio Storaro lights both the interiors and exteriors mighty prettily). But Allen needs a shot of new blood: his plots change from movie to movie, yet his male-female hang-ups remain the same, his conflicted conscience remains rooted in Jewish guilt, and his half-comic pathos are stickier than ever. There's an awful lot of romantic regret here--sad, far-off stares accompanied by a tinkling piano--and even more movie star name-dropping (and for what? to help us get our bearings in time and place?). A few of the performances are lightly amusing; however, there are no big laughs in the film, and not much to contemplate once it's finished, except that Kristen Stewart looks like she's playing dress-up with her great-grandmother's clothes and Steve Carrell is still twisting his face in frustration because he has no idea what emotion to play. ** from ****"
" Crimes and Misdemeanors
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"Complications arise when a young man working as errand boy for his Hollywood agent uncle unknowingly falls in love with his uncle's mistress in this nostalgic 1930s-set Woody Allen film. The film takes a long time to warm up, only really taking off once the love triangle is established, however, the dynamics of the triangle are rather fascinating with both the uncle and nephew only gradually finding out that each is a third wheel in the other's affair. That said, the strongest aspect of 'Café Society' is a subplot involving an annoying neighbour and a housewife who goes to extreme measures to ensure that he stops intimidating her family. At first, the subplot seems awkwardly shoehorned in, but given much of philosophical dialogue (""emotions are not rational""; ""people are responsible for one another""), it would appear that the subplot is an attempt to give the project a 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' edge, inviting comparisons between the nephew and uncle's misdemeanor flings and the more serious stuff involving their relatives and the neighbour. It is an ambitious angle, if one that does not quite work due to how strangely shoehorned the subplot is, and together with detailed period sets and a good Louis B. Mayer impersonator, there is quite a bit of interest here. This may not be one of Allen's better films, but his presence (if only as narrator here) is always welcome in any film and his ideas are as thought-provoking as ever (""no answer is also an answer"") even if several of themes and notions are ones that Allen has explored time and time again."
" Take me to 'Cafe Society'!
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Even at the age of 80, the iconic and prolific filmmaker Woody Allen has not lost his wit, charm, or ability to churn out film after film every year. With a little bit of 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan' mixed in the frying pan, Allen brings this 1930's Hollywood story come to life, titled 'Cafe Society'. It's been a while since Allen has made Los Angeles the backdrop for one of his films,and this sweet, funny, romantic film really hits all of those famous Woody Allen notes that we've come to expect over the years. It might not be the most original story, but when Woody Allen does these neurotic love stories, the characters, dialogue, and plot all come together in a cohesive and very funny manner. It's what Allen does best, and he is back in full form with 'Cafe Society'.Allen is also known for casting big name stars in these little films and this one is no different as Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, and Steve Carell lead this amazing cast. The film follows Brooklyn native Bobby Dorfman (Eisenberg, or a would-be Woody Allen in his younger years), as he shows up in 1930's Hollywood in hopes of getting a job with his movie studio agent, Uncle Phil (Carell), who gives Dorfman a job of running errands. Phil name drops all of the actors and actresses he schmoozes with and is a master of his domain, although he is secretly having an affair with one of his secretaries Vonnie (Stewart), even though Phil seems happily married already. Phil enlists the help of Vonnie to show his new nephew Bobby around Hollywood and the two young adults fall for each other, which makes a weird family love triangle.Soon enough Bobby moves back to New York in what seems like a joke from Woody Allen on how much he dislikes Hollywood, where Bobby takes on running the new fancy nightclub that his older gangster brother Ben (Corey Stoll) owns. In 'Annie Hall' fashion, the two lovers go their separate ways with different lives only to have their paths cross again down the road, brining up past feelings. It's all funny and sweet, which is what Allen does best. Jesse Eisenberg plays Dorfman or a younger Woody Allen to a tee, hitting all of the neurotic one liners and notes that we've seen from Allen's younger days. Even Eisenberg's body language is spot on here. Kristen Stewart brings her charm to the screen in every scene and makes you wish she would be on more period piece films. Carell plays the super busy agent very well, and also has a softer side to him than he lets on to.Dorfman and Ben's Jewish parents steal the show though and are so funny every time they are on screen, whether they are complaining about their son being a gangster or worse, dating a non-jew. The wardrobe for the time period is always great to see and executed well here and the filming is excellent with the right amount of glitz and glamour that was old Hollywood. Woody Allen has knocked it out of the park with 'Cafe Society' and has quickly become one of my favorites in his long list of films.HIGHLY RECOMMNEDED!"
" It may be old hat, but it's a classy old hat.
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"From the Bronx to Beverly Hills and back again, this is another one of Woody Allen's nostalgia trips, not always accurate with the way he drops names, but charming none the less. Jessie Eisenberg is a charming Woody act-a-like, the young, innocent kid from the Bronx who ends up working for his name dropping Hollywood agent uncle (Steve Carrell) who is having an affair with the girl Eisenberg loves. In the meantime, on the other coast, Carell's siblings deal with the mobster brother who runs a fancy nightclub (""the Café Society"") and kills people on the side. Get out your score card; it's going to be a challenge in just figuring out who is who.Fans of Woody's work between 1983 and 1994 (""Zelig"" to ""Bullets Over Broadway"") will see aspects of everyone of those films, the old style Hollywood, the bittersweet romance, the mob influence on artistic integrity and of course the great big Jewish family, surrounded by sumptuous standards of the 1920's and '30s, the costumes and lavish sets, colorful photography and many interesting, eccentric characters. But in repeating the formula, it's going to have his detractors, although I am definitely not one of.While I am not going to budge in my determination to never see ""The Social Network"", I am now officially an admirer of the quirky Eisenberg. He is made for period parts, and the first half focusing on him is thrilling. But Allen tries to do too much in just over 90 minutes, and the New York story just isn't as interesting as the Hollywood story. I wanted to see more if Jeannie Berlin as Eisenberg's mother, obviously emulating Julie Kavner in ""Radio Days"" and often seems to be imitating Elaine May.. Sari Lennick seems to be taking on the Dianne Wiest persona, making me wish that Woody would return to his favorite acting ensemble of that era, and try to do something new rather than improve on something he's ready done perfectly. Allen sounds tired in his narration, like it was added at the last minute to connect with his earlier works."
" A life unexamined is not worth living...and a life examined is no bargain.
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,6,"Leave it to Woody Allen to add that ending to a quote by Socrates.Woody Allen is so prolific that he can't possibly knock one out of the park every time. Though ""Cafe Society"" has a bittersweet, thoughtful quality about it, it's not one of his best.Jesse Eisenberg is the Woody character, Bobby, who moves to LA from the Bronx in the 1930s and drops in on his highly successful agent uncle, Phil Stern (Steve Carrell). Bobby has only been trying to see him for three weeks, but Uncle Phil finally comes through. He has Bobby work for him doing errands until he can steer him toward something better. He also asks his secretary Vonnie (Kristen Stewart) to show Bobby around.Bobby falls for Vonnie immediately, but unbeknownst to him, she's having an affair with his uncle, who is married. Phil decides he can't leave his wife and breaks it off with her, and she and Bobby wind up falling in love. But later, it falls to Vonnie to make a choice.Cafe Society is a little on the slow side - the acting is good, there are a few jokes, it's historically accurate (I'm always looking for films about old Hollywood to goof up like Barton Fink), and the photography and fashions are beautiful.Woody is talking here about the road not taken and showing us two people who think about that other road often. Of course there's no answer, but it is something we all wonder about especially as we age.I just don't think the story was tight enough - it seemed to meander.I'm not familiar with Kristen Stewart. She has a special beauty and a nice presence and fit into the film well. Eisenberg, like most actors doing the Woody character in Woody films, takes on some of Allen's inflections. He's likable. Steve Carrell's role does not play to his strengths but he pulls it off. Someone on this board complained about Bobby's parents. I thought Jeanie Berlin, whom I haven't seen in years, was terrific and gave a very realistic performance.Not a heck of a lot goes on in this film - it's not serious like Crimes and Misdemeanors and it's not Bullets Over Broadway, which was a comedy with serious undertones about art. I think here Allen making a choice about which it would be may have been a good idea."
" A ton of potential, but fell a bit short.
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,5,"I am a fan of Woody Allen's. I enjoy his films, as I somewhat enjoyed this one. However, I feel like this film had a ton of potential but fell short partially due to casting. Jesse Eisenberg was a very odd choice for this role and, for me, it didn't work at all. He plays the awkward part well, but later in the film when he is supposed to be more confident he was still incredibly awkward. He just didn't fit in this role. Kristen Stewart did fairly well, and Steve Carell didn't disappoint. The movie jumped around quite a bit, even with the narration. I didn't feel I really connected with any of the characters because it did not really allow for you to get to know them well. It was entertaining to watch once, but I won't watch it again."
" Harmlessly familiar
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"Even Woody Allen's worst films are better than most filmmakers' best films. Lapalissade. Thankfully Café Society is not the case, despite Allen's recent tendency to deliver either tepid or downright very disappointing films (yes, I mean the embarrassing mess that was From Rome With Love).Café Society is a harmless fun film set in 1930's where a young man from New York City moves to Los Angeles to work with his Hollywood talent agent uncle, falling in love with his assistant along the way. Jesse Eisenberg plays the young man as the usual Allen alter ego, though not much acting stretch is needed truth be told and Kristen Stewart his love interest as the young assistant. Customarily, the jazzy ambiance is there to compliment the 1930's L.A. that looks absolutely stunning through Storaro's lens and Allen's direction.Even if we may feel slightly disappointed that Allen's spot on quips and acid remarks are largely absent on this one, we are still in his chosen world: a charming, carefree, somewhat neurotic ecosphere that we've loved for so many years."
