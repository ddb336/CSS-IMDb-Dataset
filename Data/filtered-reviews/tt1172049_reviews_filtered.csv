" Masterpiece
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,Another masterpiece from Jake. Amazing movie with beautiful storyline. Must watch.
" It's no more than alright
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,7,"It's tonally all over the place, but not absolutely horrible. Jake Gyllenhaal is an entertaining lead, and this film wouldn't have been nearly as good without him. The emotional moments land, as does the humor, but the problem is it doesn't know if it wants to be a serious drama that cracks a few jokes, like The Edge of Seventeen, or a laugh out loud comedy that tries to make you feel occasionally depressed, like Jojo Rabbit. The end result is messy and pretty damn forgettable at points."
" A great Gyllenhaal, a bumpy story
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,"Jake Gyllenhaal is known for its outstanding performance. You can also see his great talent in this film. A man who dismantles his entire life after a life crisis. Nevertheless, the story of the film in particular remains very bumpy and opaque. Director Jean-Marc Vallée has already made an outstanding film With Dallas Buyers Clubs. Unfortunately, ""Demolition"" cannot keep up here. But his actors are all the better."
" Fantastic, weird and sense of realism
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Normally I would have skipped this movie - the circumstances on watching it was a random year and checked the history on the day back then 27th February. Deborah Monk was born that day so shuffled movies she was a named character in.Demolition was the result and I am actually pleased as I would likely have ignored this movie. I found it weird, funny, interesting and intriguing. You could easily relate to the characters who have mental issues which make them even more interesting."
" Great!
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,8,"Very enjoyable movie with a great message, but why the hell is it catergorized as an ACTION movie?"
" No one reacts to a loss the same way
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,8,"This film really struck a cord with me having lost someone very close to me last year. After the accident, they show how quickly the proceedings of the funeral is and its exactly how it felt when it happened to me. Everything just happens so quickly and you are left with the pain and confusing feelings afterwords.Jake played the role perfectly in my opinion and captured the character that is going through a major life change while also not understanding the full weight of it. The film can feel strange and introduce some characters that might not seem meaningful but life can be that way too.I personally loved this film because I related to it personally and you get to see his growth and understanding by the end."
" Demolition is an excellent film
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Demolition is an excellent film with a hard life of a person after the death of a loved one. There is no grand plot here, just the story of an ordinary person. And the main thing is the ending of the film - it is made, and it should be, an open ending. One of the strongest roles of Jake Gyllenhaal"
" I really don't know what to think about this
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,6,"I literally don't know what to write about this. I thought Jake gyllenhaal was really good. There was a definitely a deeper meaning to this I definitely didn't get. I think a 6 is fair to say I fully didn't understand it. If you're thinking about watching it go for it, you might understand it and I like it."
" Pure pefection
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,9,It's been a while since I last time enjoyed a new movie that much as I did now. Perfection! Have no other words to explain!
" Seriously?
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,7,"I'm sorry, but I didn't like much this movie until the ending.
Many people passed through moments that are depicted in this movie, but how many of them behave in such that idiotic way?
Is it really an adult behavior destroying a wonderful and expensive house? How an adult is supposed to teach something to a teenager showing a totally irresponsible behavior? Putting a bulletproof vest on and inviting a teen to shoot him, or saying to him... yes, maybe you're a gay.
I don't know what to say, it could be much better, but probably it would have been ""normal"" and normality doesn't pay.
The ending fortunately increases the score, so for me it's a 7.
10 for acting and directing."
" Devistating loneliness in grief, and the guts it takes to embrace that suffocating emptiness
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,8,"The movie averages out at a 7, which I think is underrated. The most profound feeling I get from this movie, thanks to the (of course) magnificent acting of Jake Gyllenhaal, is the loneliness grief enforces on you. The main character has no idea what hit him, and only at the end he realizes how the pieces fit together, for him, for his love for his wife, for his guilt, his emotional desolation and inability to find the beginning strand of his emotional fabric, and only at the end he is able to fully unravel his emotions, giving him room to breath, honor the people wjho earleir seemed to be obstructing him, while they themselves had their own isolated grief to wade trough to the other end. And they all had enough screen time to share their process of grief, the layers and mutual expectations and projections, and the magnifying effect it had on their pain, being confronted with the others' mutually incomprehensible ways of dealing with that terrible loss.It is hard to describe, but having gone through a devastating loss myself, (Quote in the movie: ""what do you call a parent who lost a child? There is no word for that... "" Heartbreaking and overwhelmingly true) there is not one moment in the movie that felt convoluted, it never lost track of the path it was on despite all the different character developments, it never rang false or overreaching, never artificially trying to tear-jerk its' way out of a profound moment. It was honest, funny as hell the way only grief can make you feel, like a bipolar disorder taking over your personality. Everything had its' place, nothing felt fabricated and all the characters had one or more reasons to be there, to tell their story throughout the movie.I didnt give it a 9 because of the ending, which was beautiful, but slightly too American for my taste. Not the bit where he finally could share his grief with his father in law, that was Jake at his best in the movie, but the few minutes to wrap up the movie. Don't worry, you will easilly survive, and it reaches back to a strand earlier in the movie, so it fits the purpose well. Just a little too much sugar. Still easilly an 8, without breaking a sweat! Highly recommended."
" nice movie
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,8,I liked the vibe of the movie and the charcters; i will say the bad thing would be the eding witch felt wrong and didnt fit with the movie liitle force even.
" Demolition, before rebuild.
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,9,"Touched. They had love, but there were something else other than love, which made him can't feel himself. He enforced close a part of himself by that strength. After the accident, the strength gone, he can noticed details and deny lots of experience including love with Julia. The relationship between Davis and Julia was unhealthy, but they did have love. Life is complicated."
" Demolition equals Destruction!
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,10,"The story of a perfectly planned and executed life that is destroyed in an instant by the tragic loss of one of the architects of that perfectly planned life. A story also of how a life of privilege, where one never has to struggle to get what they think they want, can come crashing down, and there is little one can do to prevent it. The main characters' life was in trouble well before he knew he was going to lose everything. But, infidelity tends to do that. Doesn't it?"
" Must watch
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,8,"We all process grief differently, and I can't stop thinking about the way he started demolishing and dismantling things. He was taken aback by his wife's death and dint knows what to do next or why to get up every day and follow the same routine. I felt somewhat similar when my father was dying a slow death from cancer, and it kills your reason to live.This movie is pretty serious and is not at all for entertainment lovers."
" Can't praise it enough!
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,9,"Feel good movie, helps to cope with tough life situations with a smile on your face. The end of this film is something else. If you are a fan of Gylenhaal im sure you won't be disappointed."
" Something that's very real, in our world.
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,7,"It pretty much sums up that Gyllenhaal can do anything if he puts his mind to.I personally get bored with these kind of stories, but yet i just think that he brings life his roles. It's the rawness of its subject if you compare it to his finests works to date.Story is pretty soft and mellow, yet the shots of the movie manage to keep you enganged. Synopsis pretty much summons up the plot, it's there."
" An Otherwise Great Film Bogged Down by a Cluttered Ending
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,8,"Demolition tells the story of Davis Mitchell, a successful business man, dealing with the loss of his wife. This film is directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, who is best known for directing 2013's Dallas Buyer's Club and 2014's Wild both of which received high critical acclaim. Demolition stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Naomi Watts and Christ Cooper. This was a film I was eagerly anticipating as from the trailer, Demolition, looked to be something special and Jake Gyllenhaal has been on fire as of late. His past five or so movies have been excellent, apart from Southpaw, which I found to be aggressively average, but he was still good in it. So Demolition plays out very slow, with the film mostly being a character study about a way in which someone may deal with a significant loss and I felt that to be particularly engrossing, especially due to Jake's performance. All the acting in this film is fantastic, with Jake Gyllenhaal and Judah Lewis taking the forefront due to their unlikely bond. The film is filled with snippy dialogue and is excellently written. However as the film reaches a head, it sort of relies too heavily on some plot twist and just goes all out bonkers, leaving me to question exactly why some things had to happen. If the film would have left the revelation that happened to Davis as the only plot twist, the ending would have faired a lot better. It just felt as if the writer thought in order to make Demolition a good movie, he'd have to throw even more curve balls in there and hammer the audience over the head with symbolism and motifs. However the movie was great to begin with and its mess of an ending really held the final product back. I did enjoy the movie a lot, though I found it slow and probably won't get too many watches out of it, I do highly recommend this film, Demolitions gets an 8.5/10."
" Not for entertainment but to see something real!
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,9,"I think most of the negative reviews are written by people who expect all films to follow the same predictable Hollywood blockbuster pattern. This film moves at its own pace, telling a real and painful story of loss and dealing with it. Its definitely not for everyone, but I love a film that comes along once in a while and tells a great story in an unconventional way. Its a beautiful story, great acting and helps you connect with your empathetic human nature. 9/10."
" A movie about a zombie
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,3,"The trick is old: a guy acts stoneface doing funny things and everybody thinks he's crazy, this way we learn a lot about the absurdities of life. Later, the autistic guy finds another lost soul and then the things go really bad. The Graduate is a good example of that genre. Bill Murray roles are good examples of that kind of character."
" An underrated gem
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,8,"You know how, on a lazy afternoon, you're sifting through Netflix, and you stumble upon a movie that you've never really heard of, decide to watch it, and it turns out to be a masterpiece? Demolition is that movie.It makes you think long and hard about your life, your decisions, your relationships, and what you're doing with them, without being preachy. Jake Gyllenhaal is a generational talent, and does another stellar job here.It's tagged under comedies in Netflix, which is strange. Though there are elements of humour in it, the laughs will largely be from 'oh my God, that's me in my life right now'.Makes you think if you're really 'in' any of your relationships, or are just living through them because they are 'easy' and 'convenient'."
" Only 7 in 2020?
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,"There is a deeper meaning to this film which most people don't seem to understand. Maybe that's why this film has low score. Two things I really loved in the film is:
Time can't be destroyed or gained back.
Gypsy moths reference for the bad parenting by his dad.
Brilliant. 10/10"
" So good. 7 not enough for this film.
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,9,"Totally, a good drama film with wonderful acting. Jack is amazing in this movie like always. You should watch it."
" Eye roll
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,2,"Starts good, then deflates into a mannerist meatloaf without a direction. No ending. Usual presence of politically correct minority. Good grief."
" It will exceed your expectations
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,10,"Another perfect movie for Jake Gyllenhaal, I was not expecting it to be that good to be honest.The best thing about this movie is how real it is, the great acting of Jake Gyllenhaal was able to express deep, mixed, and confused emotions that we all face through out our lives.10/10"
" Love and love well
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,9,"I laughed, i cried and i loved every minute of this film. Never sure of where it was going or what it was doing it was so good to see such an original and fearless film with excellent performances all round and a terrific script. Brilliant."
" Beautiful little film
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,10,Very well written and directed little film. Very powerful and funny at the same time with an interesting dramatic ending. Definitely Jake Gyllenhaal's best acting role.
" Demolition (2015)
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,7,Demolition (2015) is a usual film of Jean - Marc Valle who mainly focuses on people's personal lives and how they positively or negatively overcome grief through amazing visual style and substance.This film is about a well-to-do guy who losses his wife in a car accident later tries to identify his own existence and the true relationship he had with his wife.It's actually a good film but considering the director's style it becomes a consistent experience creating a stagnation of style but unlike his previous films this character takes his loss extremely negatively and like the title and creates havoc. But it is a very beautifully made experience cinematically.Overall - 3.5/5
" there is no such a thing as ""supposed to""
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,9,"Society expect us to response to some events in a certain way but there are many ways to response to the events, like Davis does.
Sometimes, we need to distrup first in order to pull up things together or, if we want to repair something, first we need to put in pieces. Davis does this on his way. Like smashing his house with a bulldozer which is bought from eBay, literally.
Lastly, this remarkable movie with amazing performance of Jake showed me, sometimes it can be really late for something but it is always possible to make it up with different ways."
" Homemate
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,7,"The easiest way to understand a person's value for you is to lose it. it is not a movie that appeals to everyone.If you think I could have been happier if I could live another life, just because you got used to the person next to you, the movie tells about it beautifully"
" If not for the bad language, I would give this 10 stars
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Very interesting view of what loss is like for those who have no true north, i.e., spiritual dimension to life. I really liked it. Watched the beginning after seeing the whole film, made more sense to me. A John 3:16 conclusion would make it hopeful. IMO."
" Judah Lewis
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,8,"I'm the kind of guy who buries everything deep down. If someone close to me died, you wouldn't know it unless I told you. If I got fired or failed a class, my general demeanor wouldn't change enough to be noticeable. I internalize everything, burying it deep down inside and doing my best to ignore until eventually, it just goes away or the world solves the problem for me. It's a quietly destructive system of dealing with hardships, but from my experience I think I would prefer it to the alternate, more vocal and public approach. People often deem this method unhealthy, something I vehemently disagree with. I'm a put together individual, relatively mature and pretty steadfast in my fundamental beliefs and morality, especially considering I'm 19. Demolition is one of the first films I've seen that seemed to reflect my methods for dealing with stress (on some level anyways) that didn't ultimately indict them. I loved it.As a film, Demolition is a quiet powerhouse of emotion. Jake Gyllenhaal continues to justify his standing as one of the finest actors working right now, giving a quiet and darkly comedic performance that is absolutely fundamental to the success of the film. Naomi Watts, an incredible actress in her own right, seems a bit off kilter and awkward, but so is the character she is playing so I have no issues with her work here either. Jean-Marc Vallee's direction here is great as well, weaving a sort of confused story together through effective editing and a fundamental loyalty to the subdued mentality of it's protagonist. A quick look at RottenTomatoes and I see that many are calling this a ""slog"", or a film that doesn't necessarily reflect the tragedy of it's narrative. But Demolition takes place within Gyllenhaal's head, attempting to cinematically represent the process of internalizing grief and strife, which I feel inherently lends itself to a subdued atmosphere.But the moments that need to land do, mostly consisting of another character desperately trying to salvage any sort of emotional response from Gyllenhaal. I found the film to be profoundly relatable, perhaps the most I've ever seen in it's interpretation of grief and loss. Now let me make a few things clear. I'm 19, so I've never lost a wife, a child or a parent. I've never torn down my house or taken apart my fridge, and I've never really dealt with any stress outside of relationships (romantic and platonic), grandparents passing or dogs dying, school related stress or financial concerns. But stress is relative, and I saw myself in Gyllenhaal's journey. There was no scene with him crying himself to sleep, or breaking down at the deceased's gravestone. No constant screaming, anguish or turmoil. Life went on, and only those around him aroused any emotion following his wife's death.It's a fundamentally human film, masquerading as an absurdist comedy while dealing with some of life's most confounding scenarios. It's a film that tracks Gyllenhaal's breakdown, bravely painted with humor and melancholy alone. And amidst that insincerity the film finds some beauty in the breakdown, as Gyllenhaal eventually finds his answers within the rubble of his old life. I can sympathize with Demolition's detractors, but personally I found something really beautiful that I hope to cling to and appreciate further as I mature. I found a film that doesn't malign my mentality towards adversity, but rather explores it and tries to understand it. It's a film with sympathy for it's conflicted protagonist, and subsequently I found sympathy for myself in there as well.A personal favorite."
" Demolition
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,7,"I appreciate that 'Demolition' is not the type of film that goes out of it's way to make every second of the film acceptable and appropriate for everyone. I feel this movie was rough around the edges and it is not the same beat down story everyone has seen 100x. Jake Gyllenhaal pulls off an incredible performance and that is no shock to me. He was cast perfect for the lead, there are only a few actors ever who could have played this role so well."
" Best Movie
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,10,"I don't know why but i got a strong connection to the Movie and i just loved it.
Im very sad that it didnt make anything at the Box office."
" Incredibly deep. Just watch it.
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,10,"Started watching demolition without expectations or information of any kind, you should do the same. It's a deep life story about loss and trauma. Throughout the movie we see Gyllenhaal's character, Davis, going through his past, his emotions, giving closure to these and trying to cope with more recent events in his own way. At times you are shocked and then later on you are laughing; perfect combination of drama and dark comedy. Everyone should give this movie a chance."
" Different history
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,7,"From my point of view, it is great to see how a destroyed man could take everything back."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,6,"Great movie. very interesting story that makes you feel what the character is feeling. very different and lots of memorable parts. updated from 3.5 to 3.0 without rewatching. i don't think i ever will, and i've been too lenient (1 viewing)"
" Tear Down To Rebuild
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,5,"(Flash Review)A man, who works in the finance industry, awakes from the fog of daily life after the death of his wife. He slowly becomes emotionally aware of the real world around him from nature, to life, to people as he had been numb to those for a long time. He starts to want to understand about things or people from the inside. He slowly begins to turn his life 180 degrees. Demolishing his existing life as therapy to move past this tragedy to find himself and direction. During this period his life crosses paths another woman who views life from a similar perspective. And their friendship as well as her child mentally assists them both. This movies uses blatant metaphors to address its points. Arguably heavy-handed or immature and by the end seemed rather unfinished or not satisfying as well as muddled and forgettable. Gyllenhaal does a great job with the material but this needed another draft or editing pass as the pacing felt uneven. Overall, it was moderately entertaining while being unsatisfying."
" A confused, disturbed and reprehensible jumble.
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,5,"2016 had much to offer in terms of great films, in spite of some mediocre efforts too. None of the lesser movies that I watched (like ""The Legend of Tarzan"") compared to the disasterous film that is ""Demolition"" (no pun intended). As a proud supporter of Independent Cinema, and the film's talented cast which includes Jake Gyllenhaal and Naomi Watts; I was eager to give this a watch.Sadly, I was disappointed. Setting aside that many of the story ideas have been done better in the past, namely ""Three Colors: Blue""; this is a confused, disturbed and reprehensible jumble that skews all of it's good intentions. This is especially bizzare coming from a director like Jean-Marc Vallèe (of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" fame).Jake Gyllenhaal plays Davis Mitchell, an investment banker, who after losing his wife in a car accident, begins to re-evaluate his life and seeks new meaning. His journey is also awoken by meeting Karen Moreno (Naomi Watts), and eventually her troubled son, through some strange circumstances.The premise and serious set-up for the film would make you want to root for Davis as a likable protagonist. Is that the case here? No, no, no. As the story progresses; he flip flops between likable everyman, mouthy weirdo then creepy and mentally disturbed. Why this? Scenes including something as out of nowhere as him fantasizing about shooting at people in an airport. He also stops a train over something miniscule (he's then let off freely by authorities because his wife recently passed, what?). He dismantles property in his workplace, then he later shoots Karen's son Chris as he wears a bulletproof vest. He also makes creepy comments to Chris as he (Chris) questions his sexuality. Davis later disrupts an interview in his workplace and makes a joke about how people urinate in the YMCA swimming pools (although it's funny out of context). He also literally demolishes most of his own home. Anti-Heroes can be done great in movies, but the level of inconsistency with Davis here makes Walt Kowalski from ""Gran Torino"" look like Luke Skywalker in comparison.Many great movies don't have to be completely subtle to get their themes across, but here it's done badly. The messages are pounded like a crowbar to the skull; such as literal metaphors about dissecting things such as Grandfather Clocks and putting them back together, and again- Chris demolishing his own home.This is all topped off with a strange plot twist towards the end of the film, and a rushed ending that made me question if it was all worth it.While it's certainly not one of the worst movies ever made, it's one of the worst disappointing movies I've ever seen. In a way; I feel bad about ripping this movie apart, because I realIy wanted to like it. In spite of the best acting from it's cast, good direction and editing; they're all in favor of a colossal mess.
Grade- D+"
" It has its moments
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,4,There were some parts that made me laugh but for the most part this movie was slow and lacked depth.
" Decent
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,6,"Decent story line. Watchable content, but seems like the content and the idea of the story was stronger than the actual script. Enjoyed it for some it's scenes were symbolic, Jake Gyllenhall's acting on point. Overall offbeat"
" Beautiful sad
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,9,Makes you sad in a beautiful way. It's all about freedom and perspective.
" Just watch the first 10 minutes and you will be hook and it's not because of what you think....
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,10,I did not intend to watch this movie but literally the sequence after (the obvious part of the movie) stopped me from turning it off. The premise sounded unoriginal but I was so wrong. Great film
" Ok
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,7,Definitely not Jake's best but he's so dreamy. I could watch him all day long!! Great actor
" Jack is perfect as usual
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,10,"The sad story of her protagonist Jack is always excellent at the level of acting and the level of magnificence of the performance. This film mentions many issues that are actually going on. There was also a smooth walk in between events. I liked the story a lot. The actors, directing and photography. I think it was almost up to the ideal. It lacks only one thing. The soundtrack was to be truly influential"
" Did the script look like an Oscar winner?
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,1,"I expect that all concerned with this turkey figured that it had enough PC elements to warrant a few Oscars and I'm sure that Jake Gyllenhaal's great performance would have been a winner if only his character wasn't such a normal guy gone nuts. The characters were generally unsympathetic and the 101 minute running time seemed much longer. Sadly, a turkey with two great performances (Jake & Chris Cooper) is still a turkey."
" Okay
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,4,The film was okay but after 45 minutes my attention diverted to my ipad
" Demolished.
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,8,"""Repairing the human heart is like repairing an automobile. You have to take everything apart, just examine everything, and then you can put it all back together.""This movie did a great job of showing how different people handle loss. It doesn't always have to make sense."
" Serious but funny
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,10,"I like this main character.
You think first he is weired, but next, you think he is just sad.
He lost his wife, but he could work continusious.
In my opinion, he did'nt think about his wife, so his brain was stopped.
Last seen, he can cry. I was so impressed.
This is a very good movie."
" Watched as great in-flight entertainment.
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,8,"Very dark, but really funny drama about an oddball character, who after the death of his wife starts to write down his life story (in the form strange letters) to a vending machine, company secretary. Well worth seeing if you enjoy offbeat, original humour and I found myself laughing in all the wrong places, which is a very good sign."
" this movie is just Waste of time
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,1,I didn't get what is the purpose of the movie!! it was waste of time for two hours with no story!!!
" Just Wow...
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,9,Demolition is by far the most creative movie I have ever seen. From start to finish I was pulling out my hair from anxiety. This emotional rollercoaster made me sick to my stomach. I've never felt so much grief in my life. Demolition starts as sad as you could possibly imagine. Then every scene just gets sadder and sadder. This might honestly be Jake Gyllenhaal's greatest role. Demolition will forever be in my top 10 best movies of all time now.
" Great at the begining, but a traiwreck at the end.
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,3,"First 20 minutes of this movie were awesome and they promised the story of character development from bad person into good person.Then it just became weird and got nowhere with this. I cant even tell what this movie was really about - it felt very random and like it ended on nothing (which was the most anticlimactic point).While this movie had some good parts (like Gyllenhaal's acting), but in the end I am very disappointed with my time spent on watching it. That is 3/10 from me."
" Don't trust the reputations!
",2018-11-07 00:00:00,9,"The reputation isn't good. 53% on Rotten Tomatoes and 49 (average) on Metacric. However,this movie is actually great. The last 15 minuets is brilliant. And the other parts are good too. This movie is neither too heavy nor too comedic. It's worth seeing many times."
" Odd movie with great acting
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,6,"The performance saves a movie that could have gone wrong easily.
Not for all tastes but give it a chance it is surprising."
" Jake Gyllenhaal Amazes Me

" Humans Are Ignorant. This Film is Brilliant.
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,10,"People writing negative reviews of this film are ignorant to their own detriment. No one having suffered blunt force trauma to the soul should write an opinion on a film about blunt force trauma to the soul.My child was shot in the face by a gun. I witnessed the aftermath of the carnage. My brain couldn't even begin to process what I had seen. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays the effects of such trauma as well as I've seen.If you write something negative, nothing truly negative has EVER occurred in your life."

" Great concept, great writing, great directing, great cast
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,9,"What a good concept. Somebody dies, and it frees you up to start a whole new life. I love it. In my case it wasn't a physical death, but the death of a marriage, that freed me up to live the way I really wanted to live. And yeah, Jake G. is great in this, but don't underestimate the other actors, the screenwriter, and the director. I think EVERYBODY combined to do a great job here. I don't know how these creative people do it. The film is so off beat, yet so perfect. The creative team must really be a bunch of weird, but really great, people. I guess not everybody will like this film, but I loved it."
" Things come together with patience
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,7,"Demolition seems to be a rare type of film in which we are not used to seeing in Hollywood these days. The film has a more real atmosphereand feel to it where the characters aren't necessarily good people, but we do connect and rootforthe leads. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a very sounded performance as he carries the film together. Described as a strange film, this film isn't predictable which is a good thing, as we do not know what to expect as each scene comes together. The film shifts tones on almost a scene to scene basis, and it's easy to overlook how quickly a director can lose track of these tonal shifts. But director Jean-Marc Vallée never puts a foot out of line. There isn't a single shot that feels out of place. Vallée's other gift is the David O Russell-like ability to extract great performances out of his cast, as this film like somewhat of a O'Russell film. Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the most consistently brilliant American star working right now. The fact that he has only been nominated for an Oscar once is something, but perhaps his best has yet to come."

despite he wasn't feel any meaning of marriage before her death, any feeling of love, rest and the meaning of exist.Jake's performance was so honest and spontaneous, the picture was so good.this movie suits who feels loss, who couldn't find themselves, it may help them."
" Grief seen through a quirky lens
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,8,"7.5/10 Watching Demolition felt like being spoon-fed caviar. The one who feeds you expects both appreciation of its fine taste and a complete lack of skills regarding the use of silverware. While all that caviar is still appetizing, it would be a lot better if you didn't hear a ""Choo Choo, open your mouth!"" whenever the ordeuver is tasted. As ever Gyllenhall has been fantastic playing a grieving quirky character, whose letters serve both as therapy and exposition devices for the audience. Naomi Watts is a bit underused, as a melanchonicly calm woman with a redneck husband and a rebellious kid. The journey is tight and collected, opposed to the behavior of these individuals whose story we follow. Everyone talks in an odd, overexplainable manner, which kind of bothered me throughout. As Gyllenhalls character says: ""Everything has become a metaphor"", you feel spoiled with all this unnecessary commentary of things meant to be subtle. We all know that him destroying his house, acting sporadically and delving into small issues isn't just a random eccentricity, but an allegory for his suffering. Speaking of suffering, Judah Lewis convincingly plays a teenage brat with an internal conflict of his own. Seeing a great kid actor nowadays is always a breath of fresh air.Conclusion: 
Demolition explores themes that have the need to be explored, though not with a sledgehammer and a hunting knife. It's short, tight and persuasively watchable, despite so on-the-nose. Worth watching for the great performances and the wonderful character interactions."
" Life falling apart one piece at a time
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,7,"Davis Mitchell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in a car crash with his wife who is fatally injured. He is an investment banker who works for his father-in- law. After a period of time, Phil expects Davis to pull himself together, get back to work, and administer his wife's trust account.From the beginning Davis reacts in bizarre ways to the death his wife. It starts at the hospital when the vending machine malfunctions and he writes to the company with his complaints. As Davis begins to slip further and further into his own world, he stumbles into a platonic relationship with the customer service rep Karen Moreno (Naomi Watts). As his anger increases and he is still without tears, he purchases various took kits and power tools and begins to literally demolish his world, one piece at a time.Interesting ending, makes you wonder what you do if this happened to you?"

But I guess all sins are forgiven because of those big puppy dog eyes she had. Here, have a carousel. Then he tells the kid that he's going to have a hard life if he is gay, when we all know it's cooler to be gay than straight these days. Wait, but it gets even better when he apologizes to the parents that hid the cheating/abortion from him."
" A poignant and compelling story of pain, vulnerability, and human connection
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,9,"I really loved this movie. A whole lot. Wow. The story really resonated with me.The movie follows the connections shared by Davis with Karen, and Davis with Karen's son Chris, as well as other characters, as they take apart their own lives, demolishing their pain, and building a new life together. We get a glimpse into the pain experienced by people that can be healed through destroying the past, rebuilding for the future, and connecting with others.Every character is multi-dimensional, experiencing inner turmoil, struggling in their own ways. Even the deceased character (no spoiler, but it's pretty obvious who unless you know nothing about the movie) is multi dimensional and we learn about her own struggles.Physical pain vs emotional pain, and physical possessions vs personal connections are large themes of the movie. The ability to feel feelings, to control them, and the joy that comes once you feel free to release them. Sometimes you need to destroy and take everything apart to fix it.There are moments of raw human emotion and vulnerability, laughter, regret and grief, childlike connection, painful isolation and loneliness, forgiveness and sorrow. It's truly an astounding experience. I laughed and cried and felt this movie was written about my own life.I found it breathtaking seeing pain and comfort in this way. How two people who are complete strangers can have an immediate connection, one that is very unique and deeper compared to relationships characters spent years building. This story may not be for everyone, but I found it shockingly compelling, poignant, and relatable."
" loss
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,6,"Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal) works in Phil (Chris Cooper)'s small, rich investment firm. Despite Phil's objections, Davis marries his daughter Julia. Davis and Julia get into a car crash and Julia is killed. Davis is emotionally stunned and lost. He becomes obsessed with disassembling starting with his fridge. His complaint letters get the attention of customer service rep Karen (Naomi Watts) who has her own dysfunctions.This small movie about loss and dysfunction has some good potential. It definitely has some great actors. I want to push harder and put the characters in more danger. For example, the boy struggles with his sexuality but he could have had some great interactions with his schoolmates. There is drama left on the table. Davis and Karen have an interesting start but their relationship needs to be pushed. Karen's husband could have done more than follow him in the station-wagon. Its quiet losses leave the movie less than what it could have been."
" Good acting, terrible script..
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,5,"As others have mentioned, we all deal with grief in our own way. But I thought Jake's character was intelligent enough that he should at least admitted to himself and others he was not being normal in his reaction to the sudden death of someone he was supposedly sharing the rest of his life with. The writer portrayed him as this incredibly self centered human being and then his suddenly becoming this very caring person to a troubled teen. It felt like it was just thrown in to make us feel he wasn't a total low life. Somehow To make us all forget everything we sensed prior .. Made little sense. Then his final suggestion is suppose to make us feel all fuzzy inside for him ??. That bordered on the ridiculous. Actors were all great, just an very immature script."
" Great acting almost saves a contrived plot and ham handed symbolism
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,5,"People deal with grief in many ways, but it's hard to believe it would turn someone into a self-centered, unhinged lunatic. And if he did fall that far, it's unlikely that he would snap right back after few convenient plot turns. To Jake Gyllenhaal's credit, he *almost* makes it believable.He plays an investment banker whose wife is killed in a car accident in the first few minutes of the movie. This causes him to question the priorities in his life, alienate everyone around him, and begin to develop a fascination with taking things apart - or just straight up breaking them (ouch! someone just hit me in the head with a blunt metaphor).Through a genuinely original plot device, he starts a relationship with Naomi Watts. She's got her own baggage. Among other things, she has a very troubled teen son, whom she largely ignores, so he has plenty of time to spend with the clearly unstable man she has just welcomed into their lives. Again, Watts is a good enough actress that you kind of forget the fact her character isn't going to win mother of the year.The plot develops through a series of turns and revelations that are all just a bit to neat and contrived. It's not formulaic by any means, but there's never any doubt where it's headed.Chris Cooper turns in his usual great performance as the father of Gyllenhaal's dead wife. He also has the advantage of playing the only character who's behavior seems reasonable.All in all, the movie had a interesting and original premise, but the writer was just a little to impressed with himself."
" Demolition Smashes Itself To Pieces
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,5,"It's difficult to fully understand what writer Bryan Sipe and director/co-producer Jean-Marc Vallee we thinking when they fashioned this interesting but ultimately unsatisfying movie. As an examination of grief and the different ways we humans react to it – it might have been effective if it didn't continually stray into so many over the top messy situations. There are just too many foolish plot devices that lead this so-called study into the unbelievable. Firstly, we have to try to understand our lead becoming disenfranchised with his life after the death of his young wife in an auto accident – but it's difficult to sympathize - as it was made rather clear he tended to be this way before the fatal accident. In fact, it looked seriously like his marriage was headed for divorce because of his apparent detachments. Things quickly unravel further when he begins to demolish household items in his very pleasant modern house but, gets worse when this behaviour also carries over to items in the homes of those who reach out to him. Far too many overly strange occurrences drag this story off the rails into pretty much of a dishevelled mess. One particularly unpleasant sequence has him taking the foul-mouthed, troubled, and sexually 'confused' 15yr old son of a newly acquired female acquaintance to his home, then proceeds to smash the entire premises to pieces with demolishing sledgehammers – encouraging the lad to join in the carnage as if it were some 'fun' task. This, being just one of several irresponsible acts that either involves destruction or encouraging the young lad to shoot at him with a handgun - while he wears a bullet proof vest! In their attempts to be topical, controversial, or 'off-the-wall' these movie makers tend to sabotage their own work – assuring it becoming the failure it certainly was. Only redeeming features are some OK performances, photography, and use of a few good song selections.Those who look for movies that deliberately set out to ""rock the boat"" will think this pretty good – but, with a box office return of around $4million out of a $10million budget - it would seem most found it unsettling or ultimately boring. Pity, with a little more controlled treatment it may have been far more involving."
" Interesting in parts but not a good whole
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,4,Strange movie that could have been better. A man who loses his wife to a car accident reacts in unexpected ways. So it starts of like a quirky indie grief dramedy. He also meets a customer service rep played by Naomi Watts and they form a bond. When he starts interacting with the young son of Naomi Watts there are some funny one liners. It is quite horrific to see him demolish his beautiful home.The twist is a bit of a shock. Is the message that no point being so broken up about someone since she didn't really love him that much anyway? If so maybe there is a useful lesson.The ending could have been saved by a happier ending of some sort like the start of a real relationship with Naomi Watt's character.
" If you have ever experienced grief, you will like this film!
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,8,"**Warning, this review contains spoilers** This beautifully acted film takes on the emotion of ""grief"" and goes wild with it. Every character is at a different stage of grief. Grief is a deeply personal emotion. It can come in stages or all at once. For Davis Mitchell (Gyllenhaal), who is just beginning his voyage through the grief process, the process is slow. He has just lost his wife Julia (Lind) and cannot understand why he is so numb. In this state, he questions everything about himself. Is he a monster? Does he know how to do anything? Is he just an empty soulless shell? His old life was lived quickly. He recounts his life using a series of letters to Karen Moreno (Watts), a customer service agent for the company that stocks the candy machines in the hospital. He confesses his sins to her, but really they are his fears. Because he didn't stop and smell the roses, he may have lost the ability to love anyone or anything. He simply followed a series of to-do lists and rarely took the time to enjoy anything. In contrast, Karen feels too much and uses drugs to make her numb. She misses how simple things were, how easy it was to love her son Chris (Lewis) when he was young. Now that he is grown, and facing his own challenges, she can't seem to connect with him or anyone. Her boyfriend Carl (Wilson) thinks she is happy with him, but in reality she's just a good actress. She understands how broken she is and hides it well. That's why she is so drawn to Davis and his grief. He is honest about who he is, he doesn't pretend that he's feeling something when he isn't.Chris starts out being the unruly teenager, too angry to connect with anyone but painfully observant and jaded. His interactions with Davis are comedic and inappropriate at times, but Chris admires Davis' honesty as well. While Davis destroys objects to understand why he is so numb, Chris destroys objects from a place of anger and pain. His pain stems from the fact that he cannot be the person he wants to be. As he questions his sexuality, he admires Davis for being himself. While Chris and Karen look up to Davis, Carl and Julia's parents, Phil (Cooper) and Margot (Draper), are troubled by him. Carl is afraid of losing Karen to Davis. While Phil and Margot are disillusioned by their son-in-law, who was a different person when Julia was alive. They believe that Julia brought out the best in people, including Davis. Now that she is gone, they feel they have lost the version of Davis that they liked. They are frustrated, bewildered and saddened by his choices, including the dismantling of objects that need to be fixed and his new friendship with Karen. Through all of Davis' interactions with these characters full of grief, he slowly lets go of his numbness. The defining moment being when meets and forgives the man who drove the car that crashed into him and Julia. He finally lets his emotions flood in and he cries. He begins to remember the good times with his wife and his happiest moments. That's when he finally realizes that he is indeed capable of love and that he loved Julia. In the film's end, Davis witnesses the demolition of a group of buildings while Chris observes him from afar. Davis is no longer deconstructing himself. He is now living with his grief and simply observing destruction from a distance. He has moved to a different stage of grief, not quite acceptance, but no longer in shock. Chris has also moved on to a different stage. We first met him in the anger stage, but he has finally moved on to acceptance. The film is well-acted and has a good premise but doesn't quite deliver on its message. The core structure is there but I wanted more follow-through. The relationship between Davis and Chris was artfully done, but director Jean-Marc Vallée did not explore the supporting characters very deeply. With the exception of Phil and Karen, the other characters were more props than anything else. They seemed to be a means to an end, which is a great injustice because they were also grieving. While Phil and Karen had more development than the others, they themselves were perfunctory because we didn't really witness them change. I think this was a missed opportunity because they are so important to the love story between Davis and Julia, which is also not fully explored. That said, the superb acting, the wonderful interaction between Davis and Chris, and the honest portrayal of the grief process, makes this film worthy of a view."
" Overrated Mess
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,3,"The investment broker Davis Mitchell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is married with Julia (Heather Lind) and works at his father-in-law's firm in New York City. One day, Julia is driving her car with Davis and another car crashes and kills Julia. In the hospital, Davis purchases a chocolate bar in a vendor machine but the candy is stuck in the machine. Davis writes a strange letter to the owner of the piece of equipment reporting the malfunction and the costumer service representative Karen Moreno (Naomi Watts) contacts him. Meanwhile he becomes unstable and obsessed with a weird behavior at work and his father-in-law Phil Eastwood (Chris Cooper) asks him to take some days off. Davis befriends the pothead Karen and her gay teenage son Chris (Judah Lewis) while he tries to erase his former life and build a new one.""Demolition"" is an overrated film with a messy story and great cast. The attitude of Davis Mitchell grieving the loss of his wife is awkward. His friendship with Karen is terrible and quite inexplicable even for a seriously disturbed man. His decision to literally demolish his loveless married life destroying everything is ridiculous. But the worst is when he learns that he was a cuckold and begins to honor Julia. Summarizing, an awful story. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Demolição"" (""Demolition"")"
" Dealing with grief
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,8,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Opens with a car crash that takes the life of Jake Gyllenhaal's character's wife. From there this movie swung in a different direction than I thought. For me it seems to be about how someone deals with grief. Everyone around his character wants/expects him to be acting in a certain way. His wife's death has changed his outlook on life and those around him eventually become less comfortable with his behaviour. I really enjoyed Jake's performance. His character is weird (Not Nightcrawler weird), funny, angry and ultimately just figuring out how to grieve. For a movie I was expecting to lean into the sentimentality it played out in a different way that I feel is a bit more true to real life. It didn't win him any awards but I think the acting in this places it as one of the better movies Jake has done."
" How you feel to be Demolished?
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,7,"There are different types of people in the world, but basically one who'd share it all and then there are the opposite, who won't feel a thing, and blunt out every word they have in their veins. Demolition covers up the story of such a guy who happens to be in the later case.This well-documented film presented the very idea of how it feels to be one of the guys. Cast is good and their acting takes it all. Definitely a one time watch, as this movie would recommend some brilliant insight to the behavior that we sometimes exhibit. Good plot & scenes too!"
" A real good movie
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,8,It is a very interesting movie in which all the characters have depth and are very well drawn. It is like reading a Camus book in two hours. You get deep into characters stories. I wasn't expecting much from this movie but it turned out to be one of the best movies I watched in years. I am not going to tell anything on the story for it is not a story to be told but it is one to be felt.
" It makes you feel everything a film should make you feel!
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,9,"It is heavy, it is depressing in bits and clever the other times and it flows. There isn't a dull moment it doesn't pace up or pace doesn't. It only has dialogues where necessary. What you do see is a man dealing with the death of his wife and understanding his relationship and life. Not the way most of us do, but by destroying everything. I love jake Gyllenhaal more with every new film of his, no one could have played the better than him."
" What's the point?
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,7,This movie lacked a lot of depth to me. Jake G is probably my favorite actor right now but this movie was a waste for him. He acted well based on what he was given but the writing isn't great and the character development is not the best. I just didn't understand the choices that the characters make throughout the movie. A movie about grief with an amazing actor at the forefront and a great director behind the screen sounds awesome but this sadly is not! So bummed.
" Weird but powerful
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,8,"After 15 minutes I was at the edge of giving up on it... It's good that I didn't. Movie starts a bit slower and it takes some time for viewer to connect with main character and understand what is that all about... and then this movie blows you away. It is not for action fans that seek adrenaline fun, but drama fans will love it.8/10"
" handles a very dark theme, but it does't feel heavy
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,10,"Ten out of ten! How often is that? I go by gut feelings when rating, but even after a week I still feel the same. Demolition is about grief, but it's never dull or overly sentimental. All the characters are interesting. It's not spelled out for you, so you get nuances. The movie handles a very dark theme, but it does't feel heavy or depressing to watch it. On the contrary, it carries hope. The actors are superb, also the child. This film is portraying truth about the complexities of emotions, and how our society is ill-equipped to handle it. But sometimes what we need is not what we think...The atmosphere, music, filming and cutting all adds up. I highly recommend it."
" Begins well, but like its protagonist it soon falls apart
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,5,"Davis Mitchell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a successful investment banker working for his father-in-law's firm. Tragedy strikes for Davis when his wife Julia (Heather Lind) is killed in a car accident. Shortly after his wife is pronounced dead, Davis has a problem with a vending machine and writes several letters of complaint to the vending machine company, which leads to Davis striking up a friendship with Karen (Naomi Watts) a customer service representative at the vending machine company who is touched by the content of his letters. Davis, with the help of Karen, goes on a voyage of self-discovery after the death of his wife, but the unconventional methods he employs to deal with his wife's death don't meet with approval for those closest to him.Presumably, Demolition is intended as a character study and I can see that an interesting film could have been made out of the character of Davis - he's seemingly an emotionally-retarded man incapable of showing emotion or grief in the conventional sense of the word. In the opening segments of the film, his wife criticises him for not really paying attention, but later in the film we can see that he is actually observant and fairly regimental when going about his daily routine. To me though, it seemed that he only focuses his attention on what is important to him and isn't really interested in what is important to anyone else. The film suggests (as far as I could gather) that there may have been psychological issues with Davis - him being unable to emote or show concern over his wife's death and I really wish that these psychological issues would have had more bearing on the story.Davis' unconventional method of dealing with his wife's death is interesting in its early stages; his desire to open everything up and see how it works may have been a metaphor about his own existence - essentially stripping everything away about himself and rebuilding himself possibly as a better person. As things progress, Davis gets worse and worse and the moment he pays a group of builders to help them knock a house down is the point where we start to learn that Davis is deeply troubled. This aspect of the story is quite interesting and fun to watch (for a while), but once we get to this point there isn't really any further development of Gyllenhaal's character and at this point in the film it goes from being fun and interesting to being tiresome and repetitive.As well as Davis' own life struggle the film has other threads such as Karen's marital problems and her son Chris and his struggle with his sexuality. These themes are littered throughout the film and are covered in dribs and drabs, but never really to an extent that you're able to become emotionally invested in these themes or in the characters. Admittedly, the former thread isn't that interesting, but the latter theme is and perhaps could have been expanded further. I think this is part of the problem with this film in that it has lots of ideas and themes, but at 98 minutes long it perhaps doesn't have the running time to develop all of its ideas and as a result it comes across as being a bit muddled and cluttered at times.Still the acting is pretty good and it is interesting in its early stages and despite some of its problems it never falls into the realms of being unwatchable, but at the same time it's never as interesting as it could have been and when the film ended I felt as though I knew as much about Davis at the end as I did at the start. In my book, Demolition is something of a failure, but it is, at least at times, a moderately interesting failure."
" A very real man with an interesting story
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,7,"Demolition is about a man of curiosity. Jake Gyllenhaal does an extraordinary job as always. He really brings this character to reality and watching this makes you feel like you are watching a real person dealing with a real problem. In demolition David loses his wife and comes to the realization that he really never loved her and is taking her absence as a chance to really take a look at the world and finds himself full of curiosity. So much raw emotion goes into this film but throughout the whole movie you feel that something is missing, except for the end which I feel came together very well. Though there were a few parts that were unnecessary and pointless. As much as I loved the main character I didn't love the story the same. It just didn't feel like it had much purpose and could have been a lot more powerful. It did have it's moments and the comedic lines were fun to see alongside the rock and roll filled soundtrack, but as far as story telling I would give it a 5/10. It had great potential but it just wasn't executed in the best way possible.Because of the acting though and the ending I think the overall film I think deserves a 7 and for those who watch I think you'll find it fun to see Jake Gyllenhaal's characters actions."
" A tragic look at loss
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,7,"Grief manifests itself in many different ways. In 'Demolition', investment banker Davis Mitchell (Jake Gyllenhaal) 'deals' with that grief by destroying everything in his path ~ from relationships to structures.Unable to deal with the death of his wife Karen (Naomi Watts), who was killed in a car wreck which he was also a passenger, Davis destroys anything that conveys beauty to him, or brings anyone joy.Although I thought the movie was quite poignant and touching, I thought too much of the story focused on him destroying or dismantling things. I understood his grief needed to be conveyed, but after he took apart the refrigerator, and a bathroom stall, and a cappuccino maker, and a home due for demolition, did he really need to take a bulldozer to his home in the middle of the day (to which, comically, none of his neighbors called the police to report). Yes, I understand the name of the movie was 'Demolition', but it was a honestly a little TOO much.But, for the genuine sadness 'Demolition' was able to convey, and the excellent acting, gave the film 7* out of 1o."
" Frustrating. So close to being great, but just falls short.
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,7,"Characters on a soul-searching path to leave their pasts behind in search of a new self seems to be an obsession with Vallee, with this film following on from Wild and Dallas Buyers Club. He is clearly a talented directer, who chooses his lead actors well, but all three of these films for me, while hinting at greatness, containing strong individual scenes and moments, all fall just short of a satisfying and cohesive whole.Demolition is full of wonderful ideas and an increasingly infectious twisted humour; Gyllenhaal again gives a terrific performance - no one I can think of is delivering such consistently interesting performances in the last five years. No one! It's just so frustrating then that this film ultimately doesn't work. Whether it's because we don't see enough of Jake's character before so have nothing to gauge his breakdown against? Or that there are too many things going on and not enough focus? I'm not sure. So close. I'd watch it again though, it may be a grower..."
" Breaking down
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,2,"Jake Gyllenhaal plays Davis, an investment banker in his father in law's firm. After his wife dies in a car accident he struggles with the grieving process but finds some kind of catharsis though a customer service representative of a vending machine company and her son as well as by literally demolishing his life both physically and mentally.Davis's wife Julia was rich, her parent's wealthy. He had sex with his wife three hours after he met her in a party. The marriage was beneficial for him and Davis realises he never truly loved her but should had done more to make the marriage work.Davis's behaviour especially his newly found fondness to dismantle everything alienates him from his father in law and his co-workers at the firm. He also seems to be stalked by someone in a station wagon and the owner of the vending machine company is not pleased with him as the customer service rep is his girlfriend.The film wastes the supporting actors like Naomi Watts and Chris Cooper. The screenplay is a mess, it is not about a man grieving but a man feeling guilty that he did not love his wife. Davis is a selfish prick and a dumb one as he could not figure out why that station wagon kept following him."
" Unbelievably bad.
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,1,"Unbelievably bad. Jean-Marc Vallee's ""Demolition"" is about grief; set it beside ""Manchester By the Sea"", which deals with the same subject, and this would be a 1 whereas ""Manchester..."" would be a 100. It's a kind of icky romance about a man coming to terms with his wife's death in a car crash. He's played by Jake Gyllenhaal with a pained expression on his face that says, ""How did I end up in something like this"". Naomi Watts, looking baffled, is the woman who helps him cope. Chris Cooper, in a small part as the dead wife's father, almost makes this bearable but the appalling script defeats him. Did anyone actually think this was worth making? If this is the in-flight 'entertainment' on a Trans-Atlantic crossing you might find yourself hoping the plane takes a nose-dive."
" Brilliant
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"A refreshing movie portraying a midlife crisis brought on by the reality check of death. Jake has proved over and over what a fantastic actor he is. He can take on any role and make it gospel. He can play the goof, the boy toy, the romantic, the warrior and the guy of your dreams all in one movie. This movie hit every emotion from, love, hate, envy, jealousy, fear, loss, and lack of all of the above by just feeling nothing. With the idea of breaking your problems down to taking it apart Davis decides taking things apart is the only way to figure out what the next step is. Brilliant idea broken down to the most basic concept. ""What do I do now?"" Brilliant. The relationship between Davis and Karen is refreshing and not at all expected. Nothing sexual just 2 people needing ""Someone"". The relationship of Davis and Chris is inspiring and well done for such a sticky atomic subject. All around refreshing and well done."
" Gorgeous until like 10 minutes before the end
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,7,"Gorgeous movie, really. Until the last 10 minutes or so where somehow some cloying TV- movie plot twists take place. It could have been a well acted, bit of an intense movie with a guy who is not flowing well with his parents in law.So I would say cut! At the last hospital scene."
" Largely uninspired and forgetful
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,4,"Ever reliable Jake Gyllenhall and Naomi Watts wander around a mess of a film, that is never quite sure of what it wants be or what tone to tackle, thanks to a largely uninspired script and a grossly lackluster direction by Jean-Marc Vallé. The initial act is promising and is even carried out nicely, but as soon as the drive, or lack thereof, of Gyllenhall's character is presented and played out, the film spirals out of control checking every clichéd box and ironically becoming even more aimless as the character himself. As the story unravels and the characters arrive at the necessary catharsis, the viewer has jumped ship long ago, emotionless and indifferent, go figure."
" Probably the most-original movie I've seen in quite some time
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,6,"but that doesn't make it any more believable. I finally saw ""Demolition"" after seeing the trailer for it almost two years ago, and I'm glad I watched it. Once again, Jake Gyllenhaal has ventured into the world of smaller dramas after ""Prince of Persia"" crashed and burned at the box office to mostly positive results. It sure helped to have a decent cast, as all of the supporting actors were quite good (Cooper, Watts, glimpses of the alluring Heather Lind and newcomer Judah Lewis),I bought in on most of the story, including a guy somehow getting upset at getting burned by a vending machine mere minutes after his wife dies and writing letters to the vending company looking for retribution. He was obviously a bit off-center to begin with, and certainly went over the edge after her death. But there were a couple of things that just didn't hold up. There's no way a guy could literally destroy the inside AND OUTSIDE of his house in an upscale neighborhood and not get either questioned and/or arrested for disorderly conduct. Nary a neighbor nor the police seemed to be alarmed that a guy was throwing sledge hammers out of his picture windows and later driving a heavy equipment top-loader into the front wall of his house! It just didn't ring true. And don't get me started about the scene where an untrained 13 year- old kid fires a pistol (TWICE!) at somebody wearing a bulletproof vest!But the final act had a decent payoff, and I'm still recommending you check this one out."
" I have not learned anything from this movie only it wasted my time.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,2,"This movie is a waste of time. The story line is boring. I will not recommend anyone to watch this movie. The hero lost his wife during a car accident and after that, he starts doing destruction. I don't know why he was doing the same. He met with a customer service girl and starts spending his time with her. I don't know what I write as I don't have anything which I can share from this movie. The only thing which gravitates me is its one dialogue, ""Fuck is a nice word don't overuse it."" The acting of ""Jake Gyllenhaal"" is good. The whole movie has nothing to teach. I was expecting that the end will teach something, but nothing happened."
" Donnie Darko grows up, holds it together for a while but then...
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,4,"So, I guess our Mr. Gyllenhaal has signed on for another strange take on modern life and grieving. This one has him using the death of his wife to reflect on the meaninglessness of life in the fast lane etc... The twist is that he gets to destroy stuff along the way to enlightenment. At least this is what I think happens. The similarity to the aforementioned character pulled me out of the picture so much that I was unable to complete the emotional journey. Does he realize he really loved his wife? Does he help the young trans-questioning son of his new soul mate find his place in the world? Does he and said 'soul mate' ditch it all and run deliriously down the beach together into the happy-ever-after sunset? Does the rest of the jet plane fall on his head? I'm in no hurry to find out(unless it's the last one)."
" **
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,4,"If someone calls building a relationship through letters to a customer service representative representing a candy machine that didn't work realistic, I'll tip my hat to you.Jake Gyllenhaal does give an interesting performance as the young man who loses his wife in a tragic accident while he walked away injury-free. Chris Cooper steals the acting here as her distraught father. The Gyllenhaal character works for Cooper in his successful business.The picture essentially deals with grieving, but the way Gyllenhaal goes about it by pulling an emergency chord in a train and smashing up his home and office equipment is a little too far fetched.Naomi Watts plays the customer representative with plenty of problems of her own. Who would call someone at 2:00A.M. from the customer service department at any store? Ridiculous."
" Great acting with a good story.
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,8,"Since Donnie Darko I'm a big fan of Jake Gyllenhaal. I think he's a great actor. In Donnie Darko he played a weirdo and you could say that in Demolition he's playing a weirdo again. Totally different though but a bit weird in his own way. A guy without much emotions, and who tells the truth how he sees it even if it hurts people that don't understand his vision of life. It's all very black and white with him and that what's make this movie interesting to watch. When he encounters Naomi Watts he seems to have found a likewise person. They're both strange and the story that is been told is pleasant to watch with some funny moments as well. Not like a comedy but still funny though. Judah Lewis as the young Chris, that is clearly struggling as well in his life plays also very well. It's a movie full of emotions with people with not much emotions. It's strange but it works. It's a bit better then a normal good movie so I will watch it again in the future."
" Help Me Pick Up the Pieces
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,7,"Before I saw Demolition, I didn't know what to expect. I just wanted to see another Jake Gyllenhaal movie because in my opinion he never gets the credit he deserves. It was barely 20 minutes into the film when I saw those instant flashbacks and noticed Jean-Marc Valle was the director. At that moment, I knew I was in for a treat. This isn't everyone's movie, but it's definitely a movie everyone should watch. After he lose his wife in a tragic car accident, Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal) starts to take apart the broken items in his life, literally, as he begins to recognize the show he's put on for people for years-his wife, his in-laws, but importantly, himself. Along the way, he develops a unique relationship with a burned out customer service rep (Naomi Watts) and her teenage son. And as you're watching the events of the story unfold, you begin to ask yourself all kinds of questions. Questions that can only be answered if you've been paying close intention to the subtleties of each scene. It's a lot to absorb. Then you're left wondering what this movie is really about. It's a jaw-dropper. 7/10"
" The trailer is a better watch
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,1,"Well, that was a letdown. The trailers for this film make it look waaaay better than it actually is. Basically the film is about a man who loses his wife and doesn't really care about it..or anything for about 2 hours. This movie is just two hours of plot less scenes and Jake Gyellanhall trying to use the powers of his outstanding acting to make a movie without a plot worth watching. I mean, Gyellanhall is an outstanding actor but even he needs somewhat of a plot to work with. This felt like a no budget first time film student's last minute project. Like I said before, a letdown. Don't watch this movie unless you want to be bored and yawn for a few hours."
" A Movie About Men Feeling
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,9,"I thought this was a brilliant movie. Jake Gyllenhaal, as Davis Mitchell, gives a tour de force performance as a man who suddenly loses his wife. Davis is a man out of touch with his feelings and with only a primitive grasp of the underlying dynamics of relationships. Men, in my experience, can often be unclear about what they're feeling. Often our emotional vocabulary is inadequate for circumstances in which we find ourselves. In Demolition Gyllenhaal's character, Davis, is overwhelmed with feelings he has no conception of how to express or deal with.The devastation of his loss forces him to wake up to what is most essential in human existence, our relationships with each other. He'd just been inhabiting roles previously. Is that a spoiler? OK, I'm a therapist and a carpenter, so the idea of taking things all apart to put them back together has immediate resonance. Though I did not lose my wife to breast cancer a couple of years ago, the experience forced me to contemplate the loss. That experience certainly added depth to my experience of the picture.Well, I thought that the way the script, the direction, and the acting portrayed his metamorphosis into a more whole human being was fascinating and beautiful. Naomi Watts is excellent as Karen, the catalyst for his transformation, as is Judah Lewis as her son. Gyllenhaal was perfect and inhabited the part with power and sensitivity. I think it's a great picture."
" Investment Banker goes through quirky and unappealing mourning process after losing wife in car accident
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,4,"Director Jean-Marc Vallee was responsible for Dallas Buyers Club, a film that impressed me very much. Sadly his new offering, Demolition, veers into Wes Anderson territory—a veritable quirk fest that does a disservice to its tragic subject matter.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Davis Mitchell, a successful investment banker, who's driving home with his wife Julia when their car is T-boned by an unseen driver. When Davis wakes up in the hospital, he discovers that his wife is a fatality and he has survived virtually without a scratch.Screenwriter Bryan Sipe then proceeds to serve up a protagonist who's hardly believable in his pre-mourning incarnation. Davis appears as an unlikable automaton, completely cut off from his emotions. After a package of M&M's get stuck in a vending machine at the hospital, he bizarrely begins a letter writing campaign to the customer service department of the vending machine company. In a series of letters (narrated as voice overs), Davis clinically explicates his past life experiences prior to the accident.Soon afterward, he shows up for work shortly after the funeral, much to the chagrin of his father-in-law Phil, who owns the investment company where he works. Davis' mourning process is a quirky one indeed as he feels a compulsion to take everything apart--which includes dismantling the bathroom stall at work. It's Phil who suggests he take a leave of absence.At this point, Davis meets up with Karen (Naomi Watts), a customer service rep at the vending company, who has been moved by his letters and is just as quirky as him. Karen lives with Carl, her boss, along with her 15 year old son, Chris (newcomer Judah Lewis). When Carl goes away on an extended business trip, Davis develops a platonic friendship with Karen and stays over at her house.Karen proves a weak character with little to do, but it's Judah Lewis as her foul-mouthed son who steals the show. Lewis has natural acting talent playing Chris, the juvenile delinquent who eventually bonds with Davis, confessing to him that he might be gay. Davis becomes a mentor to Chris as he enters the deeper anger phase of his mourning process. First he conscripts his young charge to accompany him as he demolishes his own home. Later, he encourages Chris to shoot him in the chest with live ammunition while wearing a bullet-proof vest. Davis' mourning period concludes when reality rears its ugly head. First Davis is worked over by a jealous Carl but worse yet is Chris, who ends up in a coma after being beaten up for coming out. There's more heartache for Davis when he learns that Julia was pregnant with another man's child before she was killed.I suppose all this was enough for Davis to transform into a mensch and that's exactly what happens at film's end when he reconciles with both his father and mother-in-law and asks for their help in refurbishing a carousel, as a living memorial for Julia.Demolition is an original concept in that it treats the mourning process as a black comedy of sorts. But most of Davis' actions, as he goes through his catharsis, are grating and unpleasant. The contrast between the unemotional Davis whom we meet right after the accident and the quirky man who needs to let out his anger in a big way, demolishing everything in his path, proves to be tiresome. Ultimately Davis' farcical ""blowing off steam"" is too negative to appeal to the viewer who desperately would like to feel something for the film's main character. Davis' sudden transformation into a completely sensitive, caring guy is a welcome twist after all the negativity, but hardly exhibits much verisimilitude.Gyllenhaal can do little with a script that makes its protagonist a running joke. And the aforementioned Watts is completely upstaged by the teenager with a much juicier part.Demolition garnered mixed reviews from the critics. While the main character's internal arc reveals a true progression leading to significant change, there is a sense here that the protagonist's core is not only unlikable but too unbelievable to be true."
" 'Customer service is a profession?'
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"Bryan Sipe provided the screenplay for this strange film directed by Jean-Marc Vallée ('Wild', 'The Young Victoria', 'Dallas Buyers Club', 'C.R.A.Z.Y' etc) – a film that while watching it becomes tedious but when it s over, in retrospect, it packs a punch, and maybe that is the 'demolition' suggested in the title. Or better yet, the subtitle of the film says it all – 'LIFE: Some Disassembly Required.'Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal), a successful investment banker, struggles after losing his wife Julia (Heather Lind) in a tragic car crash. Despite pressure from his father-in-law, Phil (Chris Cooper), to pull it together, Davis continues to unravel. What starts as a complaint letter to a vending machine company turns into a series of letters revealing startling personal admissions. Davis' letters catch the attention of customer service rep, Karen (Naomi Watts), and, amidst emotional and financial burdens of her own (like her boyfriend Carl – C.J. Wilson), the two form an unlikely connection. With the help of Karen and her son Chris (Judah Lewis, a dynamic young actor), Davis starts to rebuild, beginning with the demolition of the life he once knew.Get past the mass destruction of homes, appliances, and all manner of other items Davis destroys and the story (well worth telling) creeps up on the viewer – the many ways we face and cope with grief in the death of a lot one, the intricacies between a father-in-law and a son-in-law, dealing with questions of sexual identity with teenagers, etc and the movie becomes more than it first appears. Jake Gyllenhaal proves once again that he can tackle just about any role he assumes."
