" Funny but for all the wrong reasons.
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,"I don't quite understand the poor reviews on here from people who previously claim The Office was brilliant. There's little to differentiate between this movie and the TV series other than a cast change. I didn't think it suffered from a change of writers either as I was laughing from the start. Some great gags kept me chuckling throughout but probably that's because I'm not PC so I don't get offended like some would today. There's plenty to be offended by but only in the way some might be offended by watching re-runs of Rising Damp so that probably depends on how old you are. If you appreciate the David Brent character then it's really fun to spend 90 minutes cringing at his appalling song lyrics and monologues to those around him. The melodies to the songs are actually quite tuneful so perhaps that's part of the secret enjoyment. The supporting cast handle the material well and it is what it says on the tin, a David Brent film. If you don't find the character funny then don't watch it but I was greatly entertained. 7 stars."
" Very Funny But Difficult to Watch
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,7,"It's just as funny as ""The Office"" but so cringeworthy it's almost difficult to watch! Gervais does this character brilliantly, though."
" Painful
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,2,"I loved the British 'Office'. It was great when broadcast, and still holds up now. It's one of the great modern British sitcoms. But this is just painful to watch, like a parody and caricature of David Brent. It seemed very forced in many ways. Give it try, but expect disappointment."
" Fantastic Movie, Hilarious Songs.
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,I was pleasantly surprised when i found out that there was an office uk spinoff! I can see how the format could confuse some people or just seem not funny but it was exactly what i like. There's alot of classic brent offensive humor combined with the genuine feel of a band movie (Akin to spinal tap and the movie Popstar by the lonely island). What really surprised me was how well written the instrumentals for the songs were! It really helps sell the songs and i dont think this movie would be quite the same without all of the genuinely great instruments and riffs that lie beneath brent's witless takes on politcal correctness and other mundane topics.
" Another gem from Ricky Gervais!
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely hilarious and entertaining! Words cant do justice to Ricky's brilliant mind. The whole film is a tribute to the hunt for success and stardome with a pinch of loneliness, melancholia and a bittersweet laugh. Ricky Gervais this is one of your greatest creations. I loved and enjoyed every second of it!"
" Grows on you
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't too keen on this when I first saw it. I found it a bit disappointing as I was such a big fan of The Office. However, I did give it another go a few months later and enjoyed it more. I have watched it several times since then and I definitely think it improves the more you watch it. Still not as good as The Office but my boyfriend and I still find ourselves quoting this all the time. My favourite scenes are when he's talking to the waitress and talking to the band about iPods and the World Cup. Cringe as anything but also hilarious!"
" Terrible
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,3,"Second time I've watched this film, you can tell Steven merchants touch is missing. Not funny, not clever, not entertaining. Such a shame as I lived the office."
" I love Ricky and David.... but don't watch this
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,1,"I love Ricky G and David B. This was horrible, don't watch it. Missing Steve M. Just sad. Not funny. Not enjoyable. Just don't. I wanted to like it, i really did, but just not well written. It made my heart hurt"
" Heartwarming comedy musical
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,8,"Following on from the awkward humour of The Office comes this film that is full of laughs, cringes and heart. The funny thing is though, that ""David Brent's songs"" are actually quite good..."
" Brilliant music but let down badly by the cruel treatment of Brent
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,6,"I'm a big fan of Ricky Gervais' work and consider The Office to be not just his greatest creation, but also one of the best TV comedies ever made. One of the show's biggest strengths was its brevity and I always lived in fear of a dreaded third series that could potentially tarnish its great reputation. So I was a little dubious to say the least when this new David Brent movie was announced. Fortunately, it was only to be about Brent himself and none of the other characters would be involved, but I still felt this had the potential to be a disaster.As it turns out, I quite enjoyed Life on The Road. Gervais is very solid as Brent and there are plenty of hilarious moments. Obviously, he is working with a much weaker and less-developed cast so the magic of The Office is simply not there but nor should you expect it to be. Tom Basden and Doc Brown are both pretty good and work well with Gervais, despite some major flaws in the writing.The major positive about this movie is the soundtrack. There is no two ways about it, Brent's/Gervais' music is actually pretty damn good. And not in an ironic way either; this is genuinely enjoyable pop music, well written with decent vocals. It also contains some of the funniest lyrics you will ever hear.However, there is one major overriding flaw with this movie and that is the way the other characters respond to Brent. What worked so well in The Office was that Brent was this horribly awkward, clumsy, narcissistic man but he was also completely harmless and tragically needy. The way his colleagues and bosses treated him was with frustration but also a level of sensitivity and understanding. People were rarely nasty to him or outwardly condescending. One of the most touching moments in the whole series was when Tim accepts his offer to go out for a drink, knowing that nobody else really wants to and that his feelings would be hurt. This compassionate handling of Brent was such a huge part of The Office's success because nobody would enjoy watching someone so desperate for approval being consistently mocked and insulted.Unfortunately, this is exactly what happens in Life on The Road. Brent's new colleagues are generally very unpleasant to him and don't hold anything back. The team of musicians he puts together are completely dismissive of him, refuse to interact with him and are happy to watch him flush his pensions away so they can get paid. It is often quite difficult to watch and just feels really dark and depressing. Fortunately, things improve towards the end and Doc Brown (who he clearly reveres) is always nice to him, but it is still a very uncomfortable experience for much of the movie. I don't know why Gervais chose to introduce this dynamic, but it was certainly a fundamental error.I'm not sure this movie ever needed to be made but the surprisingly impressive music just about justifies its existence. It's not in the same league as The Office and nor was it likely to be, but it's still reasonably enjoyable with some very funny Brent moments and the best parody soundtrack I have heard to date."
" Embarrassing
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,1,"It's as if somebody with no talent or brains decided to do a lame attempt at an Office spin-off. There is not a single moment, not a single line of dialogue that was funny. And to see a visibly aged and uninspired Ricky Gervais in the middle of it all... I haven't seen something this awkward in a very long time. Absolute zero. By the way, remove the atrocious racial humour, and you have literally nothing left."
" Not the office , good in it's own right
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,9,"The office was amazing , so witty , so funny , everything was comedic perfection. This is just not on the same level. It is however funny in its own right and great entertainment from Ricky Gervais. Just to see David Brent in action again is brilliant . It's more of a story and insight into humanity and one persons attempt to make a go of something with a positive outlook . Good for you Ricky and thanks for giving us David once more , great job !"
" Absolutely loved it
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,10,"I recently watched the office and when i searched in google this film came up. I loved it, Ricky Gervais is awesome. So cringe i couldn't watch some scenes, had to seek few seconds lol. It is a good watch and at the end he finding a woman who likes him is so satisfying"
" Pure fun for any Gervais fan
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,9,"The King of Tasteless Wit shines here. An added plus is that the music (most of it composed and sung by Gervais) is really not bad, with hilarious lyrics but engaging musicianship. Be sure to listen to the song at the movie's end when the credits roll...I won't spoil things by saying why, but it's key.The script and its execution could have been terrible, but Gervais' unique personality infuses it with just the right touches. This movie sits comfortably on the shelf with Spinal Tap."
" Why?
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,5,"I love Ricky Gervais and the character David Brent, but you can't bring back the magic of The Office without any of the other characters."
" Ironic
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,8,"The irony of this documentary of a made up sales rep/singer songwriter David Brent (last attempts trying to make it In the world of music) is the film fails to be anything new and isn't so greatly funny, marking almost a double mockery of it.
Having said that I am big fan of the Office and Ricky Gervais, he may not have made a great film here but it's still enjoyable, if you took away the deliberately non pc lyrics in his songs they would make very good pieces of work.
I gave it a 8 because it deserves more than 6.3, as of 2019.
For hardened fans of Gervais only."
" Not Good
",2019-08-27 00:00:00,5,"What made The Office so successful was the fact that Ricky Gervais and the rest of the cast made you cry with laughter from the first to the last scene of each episode. It was humor at its best. Life on the road is not funny. On the contrary, it is depressing. I didn't laugh once, and not because it's bad, but because it's not a comedy. It's the sad story of a man in his fifties who tries to become some sort of a rock star but does everything wrong.For some reason Ricky Gervais decided to add dramatic depth and psychological density to a character who was simply a happy-go-lucky idiot who lived his life without any commitment to the truth. The pleasure of seeing David Brent's stupidity is that it was light, funny, childish, and harmless most of the time. In this movie he is an unhappy, unfortunate middle-aged man hated and ridiculed by everyone. In The Office, he was wrong most of the time but every once in awhile he would get something right. Either way it was histerical. Here he fails on absolutely everything, is surrounded by people that are downright mean and vicious and has a melodramatic need for acceptance taken way too far.When the movie ends you feel deeply sad for him. And not sad in a funny way, like the end of season 2 of The Office, but sad as you feel watching a drama where the lead character never gets a break.It's time to retire David. But if he comes back for another movie, I hope Ricky will bring the rest of the cast. The Office was an ensemble show. David can't be funny if he's so alone and miserable.I would've given it a three but instead I'll give it a five because ironically Ricky's songs are pretty good."
" One joke film
",2019-08-20 00:00:00,5,I never watched The Office so I didn't know what to expect.This is the comedy of embarrassment.David Brent is a poor performer trying to resuscitate a musical career.How many times can you listen to poor songs sung badly?
" Somewhat Undderated
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,7,This film encapsulates a sole character... who you can't make up. The plot of the film comess second to the character.But what most people who reviewed this don't appreciate or understand is the original character from 'the office' & his journey & how its tied up quite magically.
" Awkward to watch
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,4,"After watching The Office I was hoping for a decent follow up of the series but I felt disappointed by the 90 minutes of awkwardness, embarrassment and lack of true comedy which spoiled my expectations of this film. A missed opportunity really. His little laugh was fake and over the top. I pitied Brent almost all the way through and felt sorry for the other musicians, especially the rapper. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that one is for the end and the colleagues that stood up for him."
" Sick rhyme damage with sign language
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,8,A very funny film. Although it isn't as believable as the series it is still very heartwarming. You feel sorry for David throughout.
" David Brent Doing His Shtick
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,9,"(Flash Review)Much like the Top Gear phase 2 (Grand Tour), Gervais attempts to recapture the glory of the UK The Office. This time giving David Brent a chance at his rock star dream life he always dreamed of during the TV show. He takes three weeks off work and kicks off a self-promoted and self-funded tour as the band titled ""Foregone Conclusion"". He hires a band and a producer with the hopes of striking a record deal. With his self-confidence riding high, he slowly and frequently gets discouraged by the lack of turnout and a backup band who doesn't respect him. There are endless painful and cringe worthy gags around his music lyrics and his perception of himself as he seemingly can't be happy with his station in life; one not of an all-popular rock star. Will he finally learn to be happy being himself and not Mr. Always Popular? This is more of the same humor as in The Office. This just lacked a bit more character development around the supporting characters to increase the emotional connections. Overall, if you like Gervais's humor, you'll enjoy this."
" Office waste of time .
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,4,"David Brent is one of comedies greatest characters, on a par with Basil Fawlty, Alan Partridge, Rigsby and all . You love them with all their faults, they're entertaining when watched from a far but you wouldn't want to live with them. The Brent film falls in to that category it is tolerated but it does go on.When I watched the film the projectionist has a fault and the screen went blank for half an hour . The assembled masses ( about 10 viewers) didn't know to complain or thought that it was part of the movie because if anything it added to the movie . But alas it started up again and we had to watch it from the beginning again. That's half hour I will never get back again . On the plus side we got a free cinema ticket for a future movie release. On the nagative side I went to see ""the childhood of a leader"" that was also pants . I have no luck in my choosing of movies."
" Not good
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,4,"David Brent. Funny then, not funny now. Makes himself look a fool too much. He's too dumb in this film to realise everyone is playing him. Too cringe."
" Cringfest with laughs
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,8,I was actually worried about watching this film as the cringe factor is high with gervais! And rightly so.. several times I thought about turning it off but I persisted and was pleased that I did. I was surprised by the ending and overall pleased with a happy ending!
" The Office Roadshow
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,4,"Obviously I am aware of David Brent (Ricky Gervais) from The Office but I never paid much attention to the series, so I can approach this film without any previous baggage.Many years after the original The Office documentary, a film crew is following David Brent again. This time he is just another sales rep selling sanitary products but dreams of being a rock star.With his pension money Brent gets a band together and goes on the road touring where no one shows up to watch them.It is a foregone conclusion that the tour is a flop and his songs are rubbish lacking any irony. The backing band and roadie are talented. The rapper Dom Johnson who accompanies Brent can actually draw a crowd and is worthy of a record deal.The film starts with th cringe inducing humour of The Office, but Brent is just so difficult to like and it is so hard to root for him. Brent as some politically uncorrect dinosaur with a heart is just not that funny."
" Office Fans should love this!
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,9,I love The Office. I love the character of David Brent. For this is a great comedy for The Office fan
" I missed the other Office characters
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,7,"David Brent: Life on the Road. Always enjoyable and laugh out loud at times. Brent was at times his excruciating best but the film lacked the emotional punch of the office, probably because the absence of other office characters you came to root for. 7 out of ten"
" Not quite 3 episodes in one, but a very enjoyaable film
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,9,"As another reviewer mentioned, taking 30 minutes of comedy genius and stretching it into 90 - especially without Stephen Merchant writing alongside him - this did feel like it wasn't quite at the usual standard we've come to expect from The Office; although in fairness, films never usually are at the same standard as the series they were adapted from, and lots of the humour within the TV edition wouldn't be allowed nowadays, sadly, so I'll not bemoan this too much.The storyline did seem to just escalate too quickly, too soon at the end, but my word this film is hilarious. From start to finish I was in stitches, and I was in no way disappointed at all by Life on the Road. The songs are amazing (I have the album downloaded on Spotify) and the film is an emotional journey, something I never expected to be taken on in this film.Thoroughly enjoyable and I'd recommend it every day of the week!"
" Hilarious and moving.
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,10,Never a fan of The a Office when it came out but became a fan of Gervais due to the Podcasts with S & K. Extremely funny and moving and honest.
" Didn't like The Office, did like this
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,8,"It is 15 years since David Brent lost his job at Wernham Hogg. After having a nervous breakdown he is now a sales rep for sanitary products company Lavitech, but he has never lost his ambition to achieve success as a rockstar. And so, with documentary film crew on board, he embarks on a tour with his band Foregone Conclusion (mark 2). He has, however, overlooked the one small flaw in his plan: he is still David Brent.Ricky Gervais revisits the central character from The Office in a feature length mockumentary in which we see that nothing much has changed - he is still a bombastic idiot whose extreme narcissism masks a contradictory lack of self-confidence, and his lack of self-awareness means that he offends vast numbers of people. The fact that, offstage, his band avoid contact with him, leads to a deeply sad scene.The comedy here is drawn from the same source as in The Office: it is the comedy of embarrassment, and that sort of comedy is an acquired taste. Having spent my working life in offices, the TV series struck too close to home for me to find it funny: but the stage is broader here and the songs, in particular, are masterful - they are awful, but not completely awful: they are simply misjudged - slightly, but totally.And the humour goes hand in hand with the fact that Brent is a deeply sad character, with only marginal awareness of just how sad he is. This isn't a tragedy, because the sadness is largely self-inflicted and there is always the hope of some sort of redemption. Also, despite his flaws, Brent does at least have the courage and drive to take big risks in pursuit of a dreamI left this film with two thoughts. One, Gervais at his best is a brilliant writer. And, two, he is vastly underrated as an actor. Yes, Brent is drawn with broad brushstrokes, but the scene towards the end where the soundman shares some thoughts with him in the hotel lobby was, I thought, a masterclass of understated acting.This film won't please everyone, but I think it will probably please those who thought Brent was the best thing in the UK The Office TV series."
" Great
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,8,"I'm not a ""super fan"" or anything but I really enjoyed it. I also found the Office hilarious, I guess Ricky Gervais just knows where my elbow is haha. I can see how it wouldn't be funny for everyone, but comedy is about having a go and having a laugh and if you didn't like it, accept it and move on."
" Good Songs, not funny enough
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,6,"The songs Ricky Gervais has written for Brent on his YouTube channel are nearly all very funny and would have carried this film to be a smash hit. Unfortunately, he decided to rely on old jokes from The Office and the basic same story from The Office Christmas Specials. 
Get back with Stephen Merchant please, everything you have done on your own has been average at best."
" not too bad
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,7,"Before saying anything about this movie I need to say I did not watch the office, I like British humor, but unfortunately did not have a chance to watch it, and I am not a fan of this kind of humor, but I found this interesting, though I got bored at some parts, some dialogues and situations were quite funny, and I think it is too real at some points I was not able to laugh. so, I think it was interesting to watch. I actually gave a high rating because the situations and dialogues are more deep than most popular movies I have watched on recent years that are promoted as ""comedy and drama""."
" History of rock: unsung heroes
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,6,"David Brent, the (anti)hero of BBC's legendary comedy series The Office"" is back again, with a proper feature-length movie for the first time, distributed in most of the world as Netflix Original. It's written and directed by Ricky Gervais who pulls no punches humiliating his famous character further, who's still on his road to fame as a singer. Gervais has also written and performed a bunch of songs for Brent, and although they are supposed to be horrible (aren't they?), I actually liked all of them. Some are pretty memorable even outside the context of the movie. But man oh man, is this a difficult watch or what, even if you are used to (British) comedies which always try to mete out as much disgrace to their main characters as possible. Of course, Gervais has always been very fond of that but Life on the Road"" feels like new high or something – or new low if you please. Watching it gets as difficult as comedies can be probably. Brent's life is so painfully awkward that you just gotta feel for the poor guy. At the same time, Gervais has figured out exactly how to make him so untolerable and socially graceless that you wouldn't want to be in the same room with someone like Brent, especially in work environment. I know creating this kind of tension is the whole point here, but it just depressed the hell out of me. In its own right, it is well done but hardly recommendable for anybody outside the Gervais die-hard fans circle. If you would like to know what Brent did after The Office"" and how did he fare as a rock star, then you'll just have to check this out. For others, it may be interesting as (yet another) excursion into the mind of acerbic comedy mastermind Ricky Gervais. Just prepared that you'll feel low afterwards."
" Brilliantly funny - The Office meets Spinal Tap
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,9,"About 13 years on from his appearance in the documentary series The Office, a documentary film crew is once again following the life of David Brent. He is now working as a rep for cleaning goods distributor but still harbours dreams of making it big in the music business. Acting on this, he takes three weeks off work and tours with a new- look version of Foregone Conclusion, the band he was in in the 90s (he's the only remaining original member, for various reasons...).Brilliantly funny. Very similar in humour to The Office, and captures well the awkwardness of David Brent in that series. Heaps of laugh-out-loud moments and a fair few scenes that you can't bear to watch they are so awkward (and this is a good thing).Spinal Tap-esque as well, due to the music and the way it captures the ups and downs of a touring band.On the subject of the music, part of the humour is in David Brent's incredibly bad/clumsy lyrics (another Spinal Tap trait). Considering this aim, the songs are actually very well written. The music (rather than lyrics) is good, and well performed. Towards the end there is a serious music moment, and this is also written and performed very well.Some sweet moments towards the end, adding some emotion to the humour.Good work by Ricky Gervais, as director, writer and actor. Despite the 13-year gap, the continuity from The Office appears effortless and seamless."
" Classic Ricky Gervais
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,9,If you are a fan of The Office and David Brent then you will probably really enjoy this. The music is fun and at times even good. Jokes are classic cringe-worthy Ricky Gervais.Emotionally we follow the same story arc as The Office Christmas special. David Brent is stepping out into the world. We want him to succeed in his dream but reality quickly steps in.
" Funny but there's too much Gervais and no Stephen Merchant
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,6,"13 years after the end of the beloved sitcom, The Office, David Brent is still stuck in an office, but a documentary crew is filming him again and he decides to go on tour with a band in a last-ditch attempt to live his dreams of being a rock-star. Like most films connected to TV shows, this is annoying since it doesn't connect to the show enough, with Gareth, Tim and Dawn disappointingly absent. Ricky Gervais was never the most impressive actor in The Office, but he gives a good (If often irritating) tragicomic performance here. This film serves as an interesting exploration of the character and has many good laughs and touching character moments along the way; it humanizes David Brent, though don't worry it also embarrasses him and every opportunity. The trouble is, there's a line between comedy and sadism and after a funny first half, the film just gets extremely uncomfortable and stops being enjoyable. The Office was quite depressing. Extras was incredibly depressing. But this- wow. Be warned: you will cringe. A lot. The original show had enough realism and honesty to pull off the cringe, as it felt so truthful but here the uncomfortable stuff goes too far. I can tell Stephen Merchant was the one who added the nuance that made the sitcom so good. With Gervais on his own, there's no-one to stop him from taking the cringe comedy too far. Even so, while he's clearly not as good as he was, there's no denying that this is a funny and often enjoyable road movie with some nice bits of drama. 6/10"
" Actually Brilliant
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,8,"As a fan of the UK office I may be biased; but I thought Life On The Road was a terrifically entertaining film throughout. Has all the elements of cringe and humiliation from the original office - minus the sterling casting and was more of a solo-effort from Gervais.I've gone off Gervais as a person over the years, with his endless bashing of Christianity and bullying of subordinates; but like in his earlier work, this is a reminder of what a remarkable talent he is.The songs are incredible, as is Gervais' singing - The Disabled song had me in guilt-ridden stitches. A very welcome diversion from the restrictive SJW / PC world of entertainment we live in now."
" The Cringe Hilarity You Would Expect,
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,9,"David Brent: Life on the Road is a great movie with a well written plot and a talented comedic cast. It's great fun from start to finish, having me in stitches on several occasions as we follow Ricky Gervais' iconic character from the Office hitting the road and tries to make a name for himself in a series of singing contests across the country. As you may remember from The Office, Brent is quite inept, which puts him in to situations that are cringe inducing for an audience to watch, and that is no different here. As well as that, it never forgets to have a heart, adding a lot of humanity to Brent, and a very sweet finale. I did find the band members that Brent went on his tour with, besides Dom, to be very two dimensional, unlikeable characters. There is nothing given to these characters beyond the fact that they do not like Brent and do not want to work with him, we learn nothing about them outside of this tour to feel for them in any way, yet at the end of the film we are expected to be happy in seeing them do well, despite doing nothing for the whole movie except knocking down a character we obviously do support. The cast is all around terrific. Gervais steps back in to the role so naturally, it is hard to believe it has been over a decade since he portrayed him. Doc Brown is also a stellar talent and his relationship with Brent is the highlight of the movie for me. I also love all the scenes in the office building, taking me back to The Office, it was so pleasing seeing the character in that atmosphere once again. The movie also has plenty of hilarious, catchy tunes throughout, with one about people with disabilities that had me in tears.Funny and heartwarming all at once. Well written and somewhat nostalgic, I would recommend David Brent: Life on the Road to anyone looking for a good comedy, particularly if you are a fan of Gervais or The Office. David Brent takes a break from his office job to take a trip across England in the hopes of making it as a rock star. Best Performance: Ricky Gervais"
" Easy watch
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,6,"Much better than I expected, not a massive e fan of Rocky, however was surprised at his good performance I would recommend as a good watch. Nice and easy viewing for a bed time film. Not to much thought required which suits me.....Good"
" Don't listen to the negative reviews--it's hilarious!
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,10,"I was very excited when I saw Netflix was releasing a David Brent movie, and it did not disappoint. There are at least a dozen big laugh out loud moments in the movie. The songs alone were unbelievably funny. (""...and dwarfs aren't babies. You can't just pick'em up--they got rights! And anyway don't assume you could--they're not light! I learned the hard way."") I must have rewatched that song alone a dozen times. Ricky Gervais is a comedic genius, no doubt about it. I only hope we haven't seen the last of David Brent!"
" A waste of time, really.
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,3,"As a huge, long-time fan of The Office, I was a bit skeptical when I first heard about this spin off movie. Upon watching it, my skepticism was confirmed. Apart from an inexplicably annoying nervous laughter (or whatever it's supposed to be), which will surely make you cringe more every time you hear it, Brent's usual characteristics are intact: his horrible sense of humor, his complete inability to read the room, his ineptitude with understanding how he comes off to other people and his larger than life-view of himself. Still, the movie never impresses. Perhaps it is because in The Office, David Brent wasn't the only developed character. It had other fleshed out characters that gave the viewer some breathing room, ensuring that every second with Brent was complete, brilliantly panic-inducing hilarity. In this movie, Brent is the only person we ever get to know anything about, so without a solid bunch of likable characters, it is easy to tire of him. Unfortunately, the concept of Brent being a musician quickly loses its charm. In The Office, it was enough to hear his band name a single time to burst out in laughter. This movie creates more of a beating the dead horse-situation.I wouldn't deter any fan of The Office from seeing the movie, but I would advise that they do so without expecting too much."
" Disappointing
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,5,"Not enough laughs or decent supporting characters. There was a framework of a good story here and a few classic Brent moments, but over all it ended up dragging in too many places, maybe because it lacked the variety that the supporting roles provided in The Office.It all felt a bit one dimensional and through out I felt that maybe it was rushed and could have benefited hugely from the input of additional writers. I get that this is not meant to be another episode of The Office, but maybe it shows that Brent's character isn't strong enough to carry a show alone.As someone mentioned in another post, Alan Partridge is the obvious comparison to make with Brent, and while this style of English character comedy doesn't really suit the big screen in my opinion, I thought Alpha Papa was a better attempt, for one thing, it at least attempted to be more cinematic than the TV format and evolve Alan's character. There wasn't a single joke or situation in Life On The Road that hadn't already been done similarly or better in The Office. The episode 'Training' in series 1 covered much of the same ground (Free Love Freeway) but had roughly as many laughs in half an hour as Life gets in three-times the length."
" Very nice
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,7,I liked this comedy and i find it sad that many people are bashing it. It has many funny moments throughout and it is also giving a message at the same time. Probably those who didn't like it were comparing it to the Office and there are similarities of course but this is different it is a movie and it is a romantic comedy actually. I do recommend it especially for people who like Ricky and his style it's all there all what you need to get the best of him. Even the songs are nice and catchy.
" Still doesn't work as well as a film, but funny enough to pass muster
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,7,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The insufferable David Brent (Ricky Gervais) has moved on from his days at Warnham Hogg, and is now a sales agent for a cleaning products company. But feeling unappreciated and unsatisfied in his role (though unable to see how he's the cause of his own demise), he decides to reform his band Forgone Conclusion and sets off on a nationwide tour, but playing in small venues to a far from sold out crowd. Brent's support act is aspiring rapper Dom Johnson (Doc Brown), who upstages him at every turn.Huge cultural phenomenon though it was, The Office never really entered into the list of my favourite British comedies. Personally, I preferred Gervais's celebrity satire Extras, which just caught my eye that little bit more. But that's not to say I couldn't remember the glittering moments of comedy gold from it, and Gervais certainly created a culturally iconic comedy creation that has endured. I've caught this belated film adaptation at a time when his name is mud because of his tasteless baby death jokes, and so it's lucky it's not just come out on general release, and this serves to transport you back to a simpler time before he got so carried away with himself.As Steve Coogan proved with his filmic Alan Partridge several years ago, you can resurrect an old character and still win over the critics. Whether Gervais's Brent adaptation was received so favourably, I'm not sure, but like the best of them, the concept is stretched that bit further in a film format than on TV, and there are times when the pace suffers and you wonder whether the material has the strength to last the length. Luckily, after a sluggish start, Gervais brings the character to life and makes him funny all over again, a guy who thinks he's so cool and talented but just comes off like someone's embarrassing uncle. Where it slides is the inconsistent tone between making him an arrogant, insensitive arsehole and lovable buffoon, which is a tricky roll of the dice.It struggles to really keep the pace of the show, but it's faithful to its source, and there are enough belly laughs to make it worth your time. ***"
" I don't care what others say, I loved it!
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,10,"OK, don't shoot me, I'm a humongous Ricky Gervais fan, ever since I saw The Office for the first time, so I may not be the most objective of people. But films are made for us all, including crazy fans like me, and we're all entitled to our opinion. And my opinion is - it is brilliant and I love it. I loved cringing all the time at Brent's pathetic ridiculousness, but I also loved his humanity and true heartbreak. I don't agree the film is over-sentimental. We get a chance to see Brent's soft side, though he's trying his best to hide it, and it's great. Ricky Gervais is an absolute genius at portraying this character, and I hope it's not the last we see of him. Additionally, since I have a chance to do it here, I want to express my admiration for Ricky Gervais as a person, a beautiful person who stands up for those who have no voice. RESPECT!!!"
" Return to form for Ricky Gervais
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,7,"I was in two minds about David Brent: Life on the Road when I first heard about it. I absolutely adore THE OFFICE but I fully realise it was made over 15 years ago, when the idea was fresh and novel. Ricky Gervais has subsequently made stuff I wasn't so keen on (EXTRAS and LIFE'S TOO SHORT were watchable but I didn't even bother with DEREK) so I had no idea what to expect from this.Viewers should note that this is an OFFICE spin-off rather than follow up; the biggest disappointment is that none of the cast of THE OFFICE return aside from Gervais. However, Brent is such a larger-than-life character that it doesn't really matter, and he has an all-new office of characters to support him here. Jo Hartley, of THIS IS ENGLAND fame, brings some surprising warmth to her part of one of his few allies.Most of the film takes the form of a road trip in which Brent and his band mate buddies go on various gigs around the country, seeking fame and fortune. Gervais is a pretty good singer but he chooses the dumbest lyrics for his songs in order to embarrass his character. And this is a film all about embarrassment and cringe-making scenes, as you'd expect. A lot of the jokes are familiar from THE OFFICE, but somehow it's fun to see Brent back to being the brunt of all the hatred again. Ben Bailey Smith gives the stand-out turn as the rapper that Brent teams up with. I'm not sure about the random Hollywood ending stuff but the rest of the film is a nice reminder of what made Brent such a compelling character in the first place."
" I Crawled Out of My Own Skin...
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,4,"You know. I fell off the Gervais-train couple a of years ago. But I decided to give this film a shot. To my surprise, I got a cringey mess of biblical proportions.So, David Brent apparently never got off the hype of the office several years ago. Now he's trying to get his claim to fame once again when he's trying to get a record deal. Getting massively in debt doing so, as well as pissing off the people helping him. Ultimately failing to conquer his dream, and pulling out SOME laughs in the process. Otherwise, this is a movie that could've used a few tweaks in the script department (Make the setting a couple months after the success following the office, Brent's got it made. Being the eccentric man that he is he takes things too far, fame's got the better of him. High jinx ensues. During the movie he falls from fame, ultimately learning what he have become and repent from his bad behavior. That and place some great characters that Brent can play off on and vice versa, right now in its current stage, this movie is a one man show stomping on a character that is annoying, egocentric and really at a bad place mentally).This is one of those films that should've been made closer to the end of the office. Super fans of Gervais and the office might enjoy it. Not a super fan of the show but last time I watched it I quite liked it, but I don't remember the office being THIS full of cringe. Gervais seemingly needs other people to shine even brighter, in this movie though he unfortunately is a cloudy mess that not only eats the scenery but the supporting actors too."
" The 'Brentmeister' rides again
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"Ricky Gervais. Chances are you'll either love him or hate him. And, basically, your enjoyment of his latest film 'David Brent: Life on the Road' will largely depend on whether you're a fan, or find him excruciatingly annoying. Like most people, they 'found' Gervais during his award-winning BBC sitcom 'The Office' where he played the self-proclaimed 'chilled out entertainer' David Brent (or 'boss from hell' as the rest of the world referred to him as). So, if you're a fan of either the character, or the cringe-worthy humour he specialises in.There's always that worry when a good show which is usually half an hour is suddenly dragged out for a feature length movie's runtime that it's going to dip in places and fall flat in others. I'm pleased to say that 'David Brent: Life on the Road' does not suffer from this (too much). Yes, I loved The Office and have followed Gervais' career ever since, so I was crossing my fingers for the best. This film does deliver. It serves as a 'sequel' to the part of The Office which was about Brent's life. If you watched the series then you'll know about his dreams and aspirations to become more than the manager of a paper merchant in Slough.'The Office' was a 'mockumentary' about the life of the workers in Slough and now we have follow-up documentary about – arguably – the 'star' of the fictional show 'David Brent.' We meet him now after he's long since left Wernom Hogg and is now a – much ridiculed – sales rep who travels up and down the country peddling his less-than-necessary wares. However, he still dreams of becoming the next big thing in music and, rather than go on X-Factor as most people who share his ideals seem to, has sunk all his life savings into promoting his own musical band.What we see is a depressing take on humanity's desire for fame without the talent to back it up. Gervais has already (majorly!) touched on these subjects in his other TV show 'Extras,' but we witness a man who is more ambition than talent. He won't accept that he'll never have the fame and fortune he craves and, even when it's staring him in the face, he will adjust his perception of reality to suit the situation. What we get out of it is the knowing that he'll never be what he wants and, despite probably not wanting to associate with a man like this, we can't quite bring ourselves to hate him because we know that he'll never achieve or 'win' the fame and adulation he craves.'David Brent: Life on the Road' is a good little compendium piece to 'The Office.' I guess it is a little stretched and sometimes it feels like there should be one or two jokes more than there is, but, overall, it stands up on its own. Sometimes there are more heart-wrenching moments than laughs, but they add depth to the film and make it a little deeper than a straight-up comedy.Many people have moaned that there are no other 'Office' characters in it from the British version, but the new characters we meet along the way should – slightly – make up for that. I'm sure we've met one or two of them in offices up and down the country from time to time.Not as good as The Office, but, then again, what is? Still solid. Maybe a feature length Extras next?"
" You feel bad for Brent
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,3,"The original office is one of the best comedies on TV. David Brent was essentially a good person, striving to do (mostly) good things and caring for his employees, but because of his lack of social skills became cringe worthy and other did the wrong thing. He was the boss and his employees had to play along with him, but to an extent they also tolerated him. Tim, Gareth and Dawn didn't hate him generally. That way the audience was able to laugh about him without feeling bad. In the 2nd season he lost his job, his co-workers and everything he had. Laughing about him became unpleasant because Brent realised that he essentially was a loser. Still the Christmas special turned things around, picked him up, hinted at him changing for the better and that happy end for Dawn and Tim was the most touching love story that I remember on TV.The movie unfortunately undoes all the good. Brent gets kicked in the groin relentlessly to a point that it becomes painful to watch. I was reminded of Melancholia (yes, it was that bad!). For example, he pays a band to tour with him. They all resent him and he even has to pay them extra so that they have a drink with him. When they do they all check their iPhones.Brent even contemplates suicide and shows him in therapy. It's not funny to laugh about someone who is humiliated to that degree. Ironically there is even a song about not making fun of ""the disabled"". If Gervais had only listened.The film focuses entirely on Brent. There are no other characters, no alternate story lines, there is no character development or story arc. The film just drags along showing Brent being eviscerated on camera.The two people who like him are marginal and remain quiet only to come forward at the end to provide a lazy relief. It is a sad film that made me actually depressed. Please, Ricky, no more David Brent!"
" Brent more fun in an office
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,6,"David Brent (Ricky Gervais) gained a little notoriety from the BBC2 documentary The Office. The film crew has caught up with him once again. He now aspires to be a singer-songwriter in between doing sales calls. His band is called Foregone Conclusion. He is now working at Lavichem selling toilet products. He continues to be the same clueless self-obsessed idiot as before. He signed half-black rapper Dom Johnson and starts writing for him. He decides to spend all his money to go on tour with his music.Brent in an office continues to be good comedy. When he's on his concert tour, the comedy becomes flatter and more one dimensional. Everybody is smarter than him and sees the idiocy of his songs. Some of the songs are actually good in its fun stupidity. This is for those who love the original Office but also those who like Gervais' brand of comedy."
" Predictably rubbish
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,2,"Sitcoms rarely make a successful transition to the big screen (the Alan Partridge movie was really good but that's about it in recent years). The return of Gervais and his mahoosive ego is, shock horror, a bit crap. I have a confession to make. I wasn't a big fan of The Office (preferred the US version) and I find Gervais about as funny as Donald Trump's Muslim ban. But the BBC sitcom was a work of genius compared to this. The character of David Brent was OK in small doses and when surrounded by Tim, Dawn, Gareth etc. But he quickly grates over 90 minutes and not in a 'like, so cringe, but hilarious' way, just cringe. None of the supporting characters are given much to do, because this is the Ricky Gervais show and if you don't like jokes about Chinese and Irish people, gays and the disabled, all done in a 'nudge, nudge, I'm not racist or homophobic, I went to University, I'm in on the joke' way, then move on, nothing to see here. Lazy, horribly paced, offensive drivel."
" The magic is gone- it left with Stephen Merchant
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,3,"As has been highlighted by many other ""Office"" (UK) fans, this is just awful.Netflix offered this, being that I love the actual ""Office"", and every so often relive the small joys of Tim and Dawn, the torment of Gareth, and so forth, I figured I'd give it a watch.This is Ricky Gervais being Ricky Gervais, and writing pretty much all Gervais. He does end up making all but the darkest-hearted feel a little bit of empathy for his character, but it's only after over an hour of the same shtick he's been capable of annoying us with for nearly 20 years.There is less character development for ""Brent"" in this show than there was in 30 seconds of the first season of ""The Office"". It's just the usual ego, albeit a little bit deflated by comparison (which, for Gervais, still equals an 11). He's still at the same dead-end job he had in the Christmas special- and they even open up with scenes from that.He has one friend, who is more awkward and less realistic than Gareth- who gets a whole 5 minutes of screen time. The rest is directly involved with Ricky's attempts to get his character playing in his rebuilding of the rock group ""Foregone Conclusion"", and the new bit character, a rapping black kid who despite himself-tolerates Ricky.There is an emphasis put on this new character, played by Ben Bailey Smith, who is so well known he doesn't even have a picture on IMDb- which is a pity, because he's the only part of the show worth anything.This show comes to an epiphany where everyone forgives/likes/whatever Gervais while he's singing a saddish song on stage- and nothing really makes sense before- or afterward. This is a cringefest from beginning to end."
" Not bad enough to be good
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,1,I had high hopes for this after recommendations from friends. However in just the first 10 minutes it becomes clear that this is a 10 minute joke padded out with filler. What is tricky though is the whole tone is cringe worthy and so you persist hoping it will get better. It doesn't. We know the character and there is no point to rehashing that but that happens. The whole thing reeks of self sabotage. Is Gervais trying to kill the character.We don't know and after a while we just don't care. Save your time and watch something else. The Office was great this is just terrible. Unfortunately it is not bad enough to be good.
" Oh Ricky...what a catastrophe
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,2,"I am a major fan of Ricky Gervais. Have cried through Derek, laughed through Xtras and cringed through The Office. Also have loved his stand up,performances. The man is talented without a doubt which leads me to comment on this awful film I've just watched. What were you thinking Ricky?! I suffer with insomnia....I find this film great background noise for a good nights sleep. So predictable and unworthy of such talent. The 'berk' gag was taking humour to a new low. Surprised he didn't manage to fit the dance in. Summing up, as I must do to enable my comment to be published....please do not waste your time watching this. It's saddening to watch such talent put on such an embarrassing performance. For a man of his wit, I'm sure he feels the same."
" Lacks That Magic
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,5,"In my opinion this show isn't as bad as a lot of the reviewers here seem to be making it out to be, but compared to the original Office series I do find it to be at least somewhat of a disappointment. I guess that is to be expected though, as the original series was so good it must be hard to duplicate that success again, especially so many years later.Ricky Gervais is back as David Brent who now is working as a rep instead of a boss at an office, selling women's hygiene products (which I found to be a rather cheap joke). But he still obviously has his head in the clouds.I'm not sure it was a good choice to focus the entire special on David's attempt to become a rock star by hiring a band and crew to go on tour with him. The show does have its moments but just lacks that magic it and the character used to have. Also I should point out that this program is definitely tilting more towards the sadness of Brent's life than comedy. I just felt bad for him without laughing or even just feeling that patented ""Office awkwardness"" most of the time."
" Not Interesting, Not Funny
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,1,"I had high hopes for his project. I had seen his activity on Twitter, pushing this film very hard and telling his fans to get the soundtrack. I saw him on many talk shows promoting the film and they would show some clips that seemed interesting. I waited until it was released on Netflix and resisted his requests to buy the DVD. Thank goodness I didn't buy it. I watched it in the comfort of my home for pennies and was able to snooze a little because frankly - this film is so dull it put me to sleep. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but it lacked humor. And it lacked interest. The story didn't hold my interest, I waited for something to happen, for the plot to move forward, but it didn't. He simply ran out of money to play live music (music is so-so) and ended back where he started. Huge disappointment but it was softened by the ease in which I view things on Netflix and that I could snooze a little through the truly dull scenes~"
" A film about people, plain and simple
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,8,"What a beautiful film, forget your Hollywood blockbusters or impossible dreams coming true, this film is just about people.Grab a beer, leave your self image and expectations at the opening credits and just enjoy a film about the intricacies of self image and the only true freedom being the release of that self image.Real people forcibly reflecting of a contrived centre piece that, although being the centre piece is really just a puzzle to showcase the emotions and image of those surrounding him. Gervais's acting is OK but his writing is exceptional, he serves himself up as the unbelievable mirror that only exists to show the real stars, the real people struggling against that mirror.Whether this was intended or not, well, doesn't matter. What matters is the star of this is not David Brent, big and bold in the title, but Pauline, Nigel, Karen, Dan etc. all struggling to voice their true selves to the mirror, but can do so to the camera.Perfect no. A film about people (not David Brent) .. Yes."
" Very Disappointing
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,2,"I can't believe that the producers of BBC allowed this movie to be released in its current state. It is cringeworthy, awkward, slow and boring - even the wonderful Ricky Gervais can't save it. The screenplay is terrible.... nothing much happens, there is no conflict set up and it is too reliant on Gervais. The worse thing is the tone of the film. We laugh at Gervais' character in The Office because he has a healthy ego and is relatively successful. In David Brent, Gervais plays a guy who is basically a loser who is shunned by everyone around him. It is so sad and desperate that you can't laugh at his socially awkward moments like you do in The Office."
" I laughed A Lot But It Made Me Sad.........
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"First and foremost I am a massive fan of RG and all his work. I love Brent and was pleased to see him back. Yes there are bits rehashed, yes it's cringeworthy and uncomfortable but that is David Brent. He tries so hard but gets it so so wrong all the time. Brent's screw ups are what he does best. I was upset by the bands behaviour towards him. He is a desperate tortured soul but over the years we have learned to love him. Their cynicism is so often true in musicians I've worked with. Luckily there are a few people that really like him in the film but as usual he is never aware as he is too busy trying. This was a good effort. It probably didn't need to be a real movie and would have worked well as a BBC Christmas Special. I don't know what the future holds for Brent but we wish him well and hope we see him again soon."
" A terrible, terrible film
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,1,"A truly awful film, the sort of film that you might look forward to but you'll regret even wasting an hour of your life on. This film is tired, lazy and pointless. The jokes would have been old two decades ago, and despite a great cast, great production and a generous budget Gervais still manages to completely fail to make any kind of coherent sense of the awful plot, terrible pathetic jokes, and leaves his co-stars looking almost embarrassed to be leaving their mark on a film that will surely go down as the lowest point of an already over-rated career. Awful, awful and awful. Save yourself time money and pain, get run over by a bus, you'll enjoy the experience more than watching this comprehensive failure of a comedy."
" Very disappointing
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,4,"If you enjoyed The Office UK in 2002 on the grounds of it being mad, witty, very relatable and having a beautiful story and characters to go with it all, then you're in for an anticipated disappointment. The way The Office ended back then suggested redemption was possible, and that Brent was, deep down, a good (albeit disoriented and insecure) chap. More than 15 years on, Brent has forgotten that lesson and has instead degenerated on all levels: he hasn't moved forward work-wise, his songwriting is ludicrous, he has no relationships, and has become something more of a sad, delusional, senile child than the odious chubby manager at Wernham Hogg. He is pathetic, but since he has no power and looks defeated, this is no longer funny. To make matters worse, all other characters are trite and predictable, while there's hardly a story and definitely not the slightest surprise in the plot. Predictibility is certainly its outstanding feature. Repetition its condemnation; racial/ sexist out of place jokes that outrage crowds and again seem to suggest Brent is now mentally gone for good. It does seem Ricky has scraped the bottom of the pan in an attempt to revive at least a glimpse of former glory, but ends up only degrading the good memory of his previous achievements. And while nothing could shadow the genius of The Office, you do wonder why he didn't just leave this beauty alone and get on to something else; it's like your favorite rock band regrouping at 70 only to embarrass themselves and cloud the good memories."
" Depressing, occasionally funny
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,6,"""David Brent: Life on the Road"" was a gamble. Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant did an admirable thing when they left their classic sitcom ""The Office"" at only two seasons and a special. It went out on a high, leaving an indelible impression of a great show in the minds of those that watched it. David Brent, the show's gauche main character, experienced a realistic character arc over the show's twelve or so episodes, becoming less a laughing stock than someone painfully human and relatable.Therein lies the problem with revisiting this character: if he's more aware, he's less funny. Therefore Gervais has rewound the clock with Brent. He doesn't really seem like the same fully fledged character he was in ""The Office"". He's more just a collection of funny mannerisms, and this time around, they're really not that funny. He constantly finds himself in social situations made awkward by him always putting his foot in it and not knowing when to shut up. When you see him doing this on stage, it is more annoying than anything. Furthermore, the songs he plays in the movie aren't funny. His repertoire was hilarious in ""The Office"", where you could buy him as a talented, but totally misguided, songwriter. Here his music is merely bad. The lyrics aren't funny, they're obvious, and the music is monotonous.""Cringe comedies"" like ""The Office"" tend to function one way: one person behaves in an offensive and embarrassing way, while another person, or a group of people, watches with offence. Neither side is getting the whole story: the first person doesn't know he's being offensive, and the second person(s) doesn't know he is merely stupid, and not truly racist, sexist, homophobic, whatever.There is a third group that allows this scenario to function, and that is us, the audience. We have the knowledge the other groups lack that differentiates us from the other two, and that allows us to laugh where the others can't.""The Office"" handled this situation brilliantly.""David Brent: Life on the Road"" does not. The problem is I felt myself as more a member of the second group than the third. When Brent is on stage giving one of his cringe inducing monologues, digging himself deeper and deeper into offensiveness, I felt the way his paltry audience members are supposed to have felt. In ""The Office"", you wanted him to keep it up because it was funny. In ""Life on the Road"", you empathise too much with the audience members at these gigs who get up and leave. You want to do the same thing.No one could forget the moment in ""The Office"" when Brent finally stood up to Chris Finch, showing that he had become less concerned with being ""one of the guys"". ""Life on the Road"" is surprisingly devoid of character arc for David Brent. His personality doesn't really change throughout the whole movie, short of him becoming predictably discouraged. The change, curiously, happens in some of the people around him, who like him despite of his faults. That the movie ends with Brent back where he started, with little evidence of a renewed perspective, makes you wonder how much longer his supporters - both in the movie and those watching at home - will be prepared to stick with him."
" Can't put my finger on it...
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"I don't even know why I would give this a seven, maybe it should have been a 5, or a 4. Don't get me wrong, overall I enjoyed the movie. But, it was so painful along the way. I absolutely adore Ricky G., I very much like everything about him. The movie was painful to watch, the awkwardness and cringe-factor is off the charts throughout the whole movie. And , I so wanted to love this movie. Sure I realized that my expectations were unfounded after seeing the general consensus that this might not be one of his greatest achievements based on other viewers ratings, but I still thought that they might just not ""get it"". No, not really, it is absolutely painful to watch. Whenever you think that Brent might just ease off a little.. or one of his band-mates might cut him some slack, you are wrong. It is brutal, complete annihilation of his personality and soul throughout the movie. Just at the very end you come across some real emotions and people feeling any sort of connection to the protagonist.. but I believe Gervais threw him that bone way too late. At that point he was already obliterated by his own personality. The thing is.. you want to like Brent. Brent is a likable character, but the movie didn't give him that until the very end, and I think that's the major flaw. Anyhow.. watch it and see for yourself, it's not like you wasted some 90 minutes, or whatever, that you'd otherwise use to change the world for the better. Cheers"
" A last hurrah nobody was asking for
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,4,"13 years after Ricky Gervais' iconic comic creation David Brent bowed out in hilarious style with The Office Christmas special, the now-former manager of Slough's Wernham-Hogg paper merchants returns for one last swansong. Nearly cancelled during its second season due to low ratings, The Office has gone on to be one of Britain's biggest comedy exports, claiming award after award and making stars of writers Gervais and Stephen Merchant. It is one of those rare examples of a series ending precisely when it should and not being dragged out as long as its popularity remained, and this is a belief shared by most of its devout fans.So, fans were naturally worried when Gervais announced that he would re-visit the ""extraordinary, ordinary man"" he claimed he had retired for a feature-length movie. With any sitcom-turned-movie, there is the concern that making the leap from a successful 30-minute format to a 90 minute movie that people would be willing to pay to see just won't work. The trend of sending its characters off for a holiday in the hope of generating enough laughs so the audience won't notice the lack of originality rarely pays off, but Gervais, working here without Merchant, makes an effort to dodge clichés and does a decent job in exploring other areas of his goateed alter-ego. Ultimately however, Life on the Road doesn't have the energy or ideas to sustain its running time.For long periods of the first half, there are enough laughs to keep things ticking over. Brent is now working as a travelling salesman for bathroom supply company Lavichem, but realising he isn't getting any younger, he decides to make one last stab at fame with his band Foregone Conclusion and go on tour. By moving the action from the office to the open road, Gervais has offered Brent the opportunity to offend and embarrass a whole new set of people. His band mates can't stand him, the sound engineer only agrees to tag along when Brent regrettably promises to pay double his normal wage, and his rapper 'protege' Dom (Ben Bailey Smith - normally known by his stage name Doc Brown) hopes to make it on his own. It's soon clear why - songs such as 'Native American' and 'Please Don't Make Fun of the Disableds' leave the audience horrified.Gervais steps back into the drab suits and trademark goatee with ease, ensuring that the to-camera mugging, nervous chuckle and overbite are all present and correct. He even manages to inspire sympathy for a man who manages to even drop a drunken N-bomb, as we learn of his previous battle with depression and anxiety over loses his treasured job at Wernham-Hogg. But there are long stretches where the film doesn't generate any laughs, and memories of the innovative, landmark comedy series make it seem like watching a once-great sportsman slowly deteriorate with age when they should have retired long ago. The Office already had its perfect ending, so it begs the question as to why Gervais felt the need to don the Brent mask once again. While it hardly tarnishes the legacy, Life on the Road feels like a pointless last hurrah that nobody was asking for."
" Terrible movie. Hard to watch
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,3,"I was a big fan of the UK Office show. I had high hopes when they said they were going to reboot the main character David Brent in a catch- up movie to see where he was at way down the line from when the original series ended. I found the movie hard to watch. I didn't get any laughs from it at all. It was pretty awkward the whole way through the movie. David is pretty much down and out and believes he's doing well as a musician along with others who really don't want to be there. They are only doing it to further their own career because David is paying. I wished I never saw this movie now. I would have hoped to at least see David cross paths with his old pal Gareth.. None of the original cast was in it. So in short, do yourself a favour and skip this one."
" Not that funny! 3/10
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,3,"Review: Personally, I didn't find this movie that funny, because it's basically just Ricky Gervais making a complete fool out of himself for an hour and a half, and the reprise of David Brent, from the Office, didn't have the same amusing sketches like the series. This movie see's Brent giving his music career one more go, so he tries to put his previous band, the ""Forgone Conclusion"", together but they all have personal issues. When he finally puts together another band, they go on the road, financed by Brent, and it all becomes a big embarrassment. His band are just along for the ride, and they don't associate themselves with Brent because they think he's is a complete idiot. After wasting loads of money on his disastrous tour, he goes back to his office job, accepting the fact that his music days are behind him but he is still optimistic about his future, on the road. I did find the ending quite sweet, when he walks off with his work colleague Pauline Gray (Jo Hartley), to get some coffee, and the fact the he had been suffering with depression, did give the movie a meaning but apart from that, it was just a typical Ricky Gervais comedy, which is more silly than funny. Some of the outrageous jokes did push the boundaries, especially the racist ones but on the plus side, the band actually wasn't that bad. I personally can't take that much of Ricky Gervais's comedy, so my expectations for this film wasn't that high, which was why I wasn't totally disappointed with the outcome. Average! Round-Up: This movie was also written and directed by Ricky Gervais, hence why I didn't find it that funny but after watching the behind the scenes footage, it really seemed fun to make, and there constant laughter on set, was more funnier than the movie itself. Anyway, with the success of the Office, Extras, Life's Too Short and Derek, Ricky Gervais has become an household name around the world but his movie career hasn't really taken off. The Invention of Lying and Cemetery Junction were pretty disappointing, which is why he took some time out from the public eye, so this movie seemed like a safe bet as it was about the much loved character, David Brent. I have to commend him for coming up with these fresh songs and performing them himself but I personally think that the movie would have worked better if the songs were completely awful, which there not. Anyway, I'm sure that the Office die hard fans will love the fact that he has returned to the big screen with David Brent but I personally didn't find it that amusing.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $5.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their music/comedies, starring Ricky Gervais, Rob Jarvis, Abbie Murphy, Jo Hartley, Andrew Brooke and Tom Bennett. 3/10"
" Enjoyable but mainly disappointing
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,5,"As a fan of The Office, I looked forward to an update on Brent's chance of romance at the end of the Christmas specials and maybe some characters like Gareth making an appearance (possibly as a roadie??) but there was very little reference or links to the past glory days which I suppose can be like real life as people move on but it left a feeling of disconnection with the old Brent we knew and loved/loathed and the one we saw in this film.I think the problem with this film is that it was rushed by compressing relationship/character developments that were revealed nicely over 14 episodes in The Office into a single film. E.g. the division between Brent and his backing band is immediate as David is forced to travel separately and have a separate dressing room right from the off. It just didn't ring true as depicted, it was too rude and mercenary to believe but I could of imagined the band avoiding David more and more as time went by just to preserve their sanity!However, it was fun to watch and whether or not you can believe anyone could write such crass lyrics and have the misplaced conviction to air them to an audience, I couldn't help laughing at them.Even though some scenes from The Office are almost too painful to watch, I keep coming back to watching the episodes as there are great believable characters and relationships, some extremely funny moments and at times it is even heart warming and life affirming. Sadly, this film is mostly lacking in those qualities even though it tries to conjure them up in a clumsy half-baked sort of way so I really don't think I would watch it again."
