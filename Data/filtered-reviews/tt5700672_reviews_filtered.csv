" Masterpiece in the Zombie Genre
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,9,"What a great film, the character building, the zombie scenes were amazing. Very well done!"
" No other director has ever tried to make a zombie movie in such a good way.
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Korean cinema is a repository of Sobi movies.Train to busan will be a movie that many have seen. But for those who can't see, there is no better option than to see a great zombie.No other director has ever tried to make a zombie movie in such a good way.The film is also a great emotional drama.The director deserves much praise for making everything that fills the minds of the audience and captivates them."
" Run of the mill Zombie film.
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,5,"It doesn't fall into the ""atrocious zombie film"" category, with some pretty decent performances by the main actors. However the story & scenes are still formulaic, predictable, and campy.Watch if you have absolutely nothing to do."
" A fast-paced action-packed Zombie film!
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,8,"My Rating : 8/10If you like the Zombie film genre 'Train to Busan' will certainly entertain you with it's slick action, fast-pace and simple storyline - very entertaining all in all.The cinematography is great, acting is awesome and the action-pieces are a lot of fun to watch.'Train to Busan' is great fun at the movies!"
" Best Zombie Film
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,9,Zombie movies are a tired genre is modern times. They have been overdone to the point of exhaustion but Train to Busan manages make zombies interesting again. The choice to keep the characters and zombies limited to a small space creates lots of tension which many zombie movies misses out on by having a large environment. I also enjoy the realistic portrayals on how humans will deal with a situation like this by turning on each other to survive. This movie is a great movie and a fantastic zombie movie.
" Surprisingly good
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,"This movie was brilliant. It had many thrilling moments and many creepy moments. Sometimes both at the same time. But it also had a hard body school girl. It is currently one of my fave zombie films of all time. This is a film that could only be made in SOUTH Korea, and with that said, there were a few moments where I didn't know if I laughed with it or at it. I mean how could the boys not be into the super nubile schoolgirl with those legs?? Either way I enjoyed it a lot and had many good laughes. It gets pretty intense as well. There were a few unanswered questions about two of the characters though which should have been explained better in my opinion."
" Annoying passangers manage to remove my empathy for them
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,5,Tired story. Most of the movie is spend watching people who can't for the life of them act with haste. Everyone is acting like in a perpetual shock that presumably renders them incapable of acting in benefit of their own survival. I'm disappointed the movie never rises above the braindead level. There is even a couple of times where people just decides to do suicide by zombie while putting everyone else at peril. Doesn't make much sense. 5/10.
" Tired story line
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,8,Characters were well developed as well as the location. The acting was wonderful special effects were great. Subtitles were unexpected from the summary. Train to Busan just did not do it for me.
" Best zombie film since the Dawn of the Dead reboot!
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,8,"Train to Busan is incredible, at all levels, directing is top notch, production is epic, acting and music very fine, and the pacing is great! One of the best Korean movie ever! I'm so surprised by the high quality of this production.I'm afraid now about Train to Busan Peninsula, I can't believe this can surpass this one, but I will have a try anyway.I've seen there's an American reboot planned (yet titled Train to Boston, not sure this is the official title though), I really hope they will not mess with it! Since it's supposed to be produced by James Wan, I have great expectations!Ps: Mel Gibson would be awesome as the hobo!"
" Train to Busan
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,9,"This movie is like a ""common"" fiction movie about zombies, but it has a fantastic drama because it is not just about zombies and how a group of people try to survive and find a safe place, it has some sad moments and that's one of the reasons that it couldn't classify like a typical kind of zombie movies.
When you are watching Train to Busan for the first time, you think about some scenarios, all about how to survive of course, but it doesn't at all; at the beginning you watch a family problem, and it introduces how the apocalypse start, when all the apocalypses' zombie, it's a real problem in the movie, it's not the only reason that why the movie can get your all attention, because when you think all are going well, something sad happens. But the end is something that you can imagine when you are in the middle of the movie, but not the way what we predict.
I really recommend this movie, I really like it, all the drama, and the way how the director introduce the story."
" so good it's almost not even about the zombies
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,9,"I have no words. I wasn't expecting to cry watching a zombie movie, even though I cried watching the walking dead before. this is so much better than I expected. They made a simple topic like ""zombies in a train"" became a life lesson. I love foreign movies and Korea has so much to share with us."
" Masterpiece from korea 🖤🖤
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,10,"Dont have word what a movie, cinamarography, thrill , suspense, in every category this film is fabulous."
" This emotionally charged and zombie filled train is worth boarding
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,8,"Train To Busan (2016)
Rating: 4/5When you are about to watch a film in the zombie genre, you have two things in mind:
1) A lot many are going to die.
2) Zombies will provide us much gore.
Well ""Train To Busan"" has all that in plenty, but what it has which many zombie films lack is: Emotional depth. Throughout the film we are able to connect to each character. A fund manager, who is estranged from his wife, and fails to live up to his daughter's expectations; A strongly built man and his pregnant wife; a baseball player and a girl who loves him; a selfish as hell man; two old women who are sisters and many more form characters who are fighting for survival from zombies, in a train which is travelling to Busan. Will they survive?Director Yeon Sang-ho makes sure that while he shows the undead masses of bodies attacking the passengers of the train, we are connected to each of them. ""Train to Busan"" is a story of survival, compassion, sacrifice. It shows us how human beings act together to fight something bigger, which felt timely as we are in the midst of a pandemic ourselves. Then there's ones who are selfish. Take this scene as an example: The fund manager and all are trying to enter another compartment of the train, but the passengers of that compartment are paranoid that they might be infected, and they try to stop them from entering.While there's gore, but the film doesn't overdo that. There's some humour sprinkled, like the scene where the pregnant woman's husband asks the fund manager's daughter whether he's her real dad, as he initially didn't like her father. There's humour, but there's the seriousness which runs throughout the film. From the opening scene where a dead deer comes back to life, we know that things are about to become tense and the entire film is very tense but entertaining.There was a scene in the film which I found a bit absurd: the fund manager, the pregnant woman's husband and the baseball player deciding to fight their way to reach their people felt a odd choice that a person would make in such a situation and I wanted the film to make more impact. But, this emotionally charged and zombie filled train is worth boarding."
" It was great!
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,10,It was a great movie I was on the edge of my seat the entire time loved it! Great movie!
" Great movie
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,9,"It was very good.In addition to zombie action, this movie also deals with very serious topics. Really makes you think."
" Furious Zombie Train
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,8,"This was good. Really good. Very fast paged zombie movie and good one for a long time.Story goes how a father and his dauther have a plan to go visit with his ex-wife with train.Story shows very good how some people get passive, some get selfish or freeze and wait death."
" Fast moving claustrophobic, apocalyptic fun.
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,8,"A movie about a distant father and his daughter who board a train along with a collection of other interesting characters all bound for Busan Meanwhile a zombie apocalypse is fast taking hold across the country. An infected passenger does the rest... Watching this movie, I couldn't help but draw visual comparisons to the type of infection seen in World War Z. There are indeed comparable stories in both movies, in the extended version of WWZ there is a strong Korean storyline suggesting that the infection could have originated somewhere in Korea. In TTB, the characters take centre stage and the apocalypse storyline has been compressed into this moving train. The characters are a clear representation of the best and worst of humanity and it's interesting to see them interact with their situations. It's almost like watching a case study on a zombie apocalypse... I wasn't a fan of the fate of some of the characters and the last minute death of the father seemed pointless but maybe my strong reaction was the intended reaction? Either way it's another cool Korean picture."
" A Zombie movie that's original?
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,8,A father and his daughter are trapped on a train as a virus outbreak occurred resulting in a zombie epidemic. They try to make the way to busan where the mother Supposed to meet them and where supposedly safe from the outbreak. As played out of a genre as zombies the train to busan delivers on a Action packed encounter. It's heartwarming with characters that you generally care about and you want to see get out this situation. with being condemned to A train majority of the movie it gives a claustrophobic fill into it. The film also does a great job in showing how people are willing to turn on one another in order to survive.
" Zombie Morality Tale
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,9,"Koreans even do Zombie better than Hollywood, and I'm not particularly a Zombie fan. Of course, Koreans turned it into something more: a morality tale of good and evil, of choices in the midst of terror, and it is emotionally draining. But it's also a horror movie with a heart, a couple of bad guys of course, but far more heroes, several of them you admire and grow to love. Strongly recommended."
" A movie that should not be missed!!
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,10,"The story of Train to Busan is it about Sok-woo, a father with not much time for his daughter, Soo-ahn, are boarding the KTX, a fast train that shall bring them from Seoul to Busan. But during their journey, the apocalypse begins, and most of the earth's population become flesh craving zombies. While the KTX is shooting towards Busan, the passenger's fight for their families and lives against the zombies - and each other.
Train to Busan does a great job of using the characters as a key tool in connecting the audience to the story. And this is where the emotions and the thrill go so effectively. Because whenever a character can bring the audience to be ""The same team"" has been achieved. ""The same team"" fully. Another good part of the movie is casting a suitable cast, taking on the role, not too flattering to Gong Yoo. Looks nice and natural, it looks like he isn't high-maintenance. The shirt that you wear is smooth, beautiful, smooth, without wrinkles, even if it gets messy and dirty. And when someone else's clothes are wrinkled, they are in good shape, that is, a good clothes hanger. And what is indispensable to this is that it is a production as good as a Hollywood movie, stunning visuals and effects.
Even though the keenness in telling the point is still a little But this journey also reveals what humans and zombies mean as a product of capitalism."
" Best movie i've seen from this genre
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,10,"It's just like other zombie movies. It reflects mamy more things. Society, Responsibility and many other things we haven't seen in an action movie.
Spectular. Great actors, great cinematography and to top it all, great scenario."
" Just awesome..
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,9,"Many zombie apocalypse movies have been made but Train to Busan excels them all. If you love thrillers and zombie flicks, this movie is surely made for you.
This movie has all the things that an excellent movie should have. Character development, insane action, relentless tension, drama, comedy, special effects, cinematography and pace, everything was spot on.
This was the first live action movie by the director and he should be proud that his first live action was so wonderful. Overall, this movie is a must watch"
" Great movie.
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,8,Go for it without any doubt. Awesome story and superb execution.
" Amazing. Zombie movie with heart
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,9,"I'm not a movie reviewer but had to say that I love this film. I honestly have a hard time not giving this one a 10 based on how deep some of the scenes/moments make me feel - even on 2nd, 3rd viewing. This is just one of those movies that makes most everything else look like 2nd rate garbage. You can tell there was talent and love in the people who made this. Odd to say that about a zombie movie but it's just more than that ... and is a masterpiece. Bravo to all behind it - here's hoping they make more films this good!"
" Ending
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,1,Ending is bad..i not want to watch this type movie.. Because it is very bad..
" A masterclass in how zombie films should be made
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,9,This film is one of the best zombie films I've ever seen I'm normally not a fan of zombie movies but this film really proves that there is still originality left in the zombie horror genre overall I was blown away by how brilliantly made & brilliantly acted this film was
" Not a No brainer at all!
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,10,"I've repeatedly heard some say that this movie is an absolute no brainer. I don't know if that's the majority of viewers that share the opinion, but I firmly disagree. This movie is such a refreshing zombie movie, the likes of which I've never seen in Zombie movies following the turn of the new millenium. The train provides an oppressive and anxiety inducing location, riddled with a heavy atmosphere that kept me tense. Even when they're not on the train the zombie spectacle is near impeccable and flawless. The zombies are great and seem to advance a lot of the things we got in the remake of Dawn of the Dead in 2003, with the charging and franticly running, contorting, non cautious, careless, relentless attitude. I never really got the appeal of the slow lumbering zombies, they just always felt Like they're a threat either as a horde or on accident. Don't get me wrong and misunderstand me saying that as faulting older zombie movies. I love them a whole lot as well. But Train to Busan zombies feel very menacing and infected. What do I mean by infected? Well it's the desire of the virus to just spread and propagate. It meerely compells victims to infect others instead of making them waste time unnecessarily by eating them. They only contract and move on to the next terrified witness. It just feels pretty realistic to be entirely honest. Just makes it seem like a next step that rabbies decided to take in evolution, so it just developed it's new dreadful properties. The characters are great as well. Most obviously our main characters, but also the other 10 or so this movie doesn't really struggle to juggle. Also there's a lot of great societal commentare scattered throughout. Recommended!!!"
" Movie .. everyone should watch atleast one time.
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Nice storyline... And awesome performance.
i think i had never seen this type of ending in any movie. Father- daughter love ... I just fell in love with that scene when he infected and he ran away from her daughter and he jumped from last train. It was really very emotional scene and i cried."
" Terrific quality film
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,8,"Definitely the best zombie movie I've ever seen. Get over the subtitles, just watch it if you like zombie flicks. It was a thrilling 2 hour ride and I loved it. Only downsides were same downsides of any scary/horror movie, characters make infuriatingly stupid decisions sometimes that drive the viewer insane. Overall really good and I enjoyed it a lot"
" Wow
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,9,"What a great film...keeps you on the edge of your seat. Has a bit of everything in this movie, it was truly a well thought out work of art"
" Best zombie movie out there
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,10,"Just watch it, its worth your time
This movie had it all!"
" Great!!
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,9,Amazing performance by child actor (Kim Su-an). Great screenplay and the zombies also terrifying.
" What a movie !
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,10,"I hardly recommended you to. watch this movie ...
one of the best movie i ever seen .In this movie you can see a chemistry between a father and daughter Also you see, how people sacrificed to others and how they do to help each other."
" A truly memorable zombie film
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,8,"Woah, this was not what I was expecting. I have never watched a zombie film, or even a horror film that made me feel like this one did. Funny, intense, occasionally goofy and very emotional, made me laugh, cry and wince. Definitely recommend!"
" The best Zombie movie I have ever seen
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,9,"I'm not a big fan of Korean Movies and I saw this movie because one of my friends recommend it to me.The movie was well Directed and some of the actors were good, specially the father ( Gong Yoo ) with an astonishing performance. He delivered the Message of being a father and the Heavy burden that comes with it to protect his daughter."
" AMAZING!
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,10,"Ok, I was not ready for this.
When my friend recommended for us to watch a Zombie movie I was expecting just a lot of horror and screaming. But this is a masterpiece. I was crying so hard and I love movies like these that have a real tangible story even in fiction. It connects you to all these different characters that you want and need to survive for your soul not to be crushed to the point of no returning. That is how powerful it was!!!10/10"
" Possibly the best zombie film ever
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,9,"This could be about anything other than zombies: heist, prison escape, romcom...it really doesn't matter because it is well made. Top notch production value, engaging characters...that it is about zombies, it just makes it even better.9/10

" This film will make you sweat
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,8,"I thought I was bored and done with zombie films. Maybe not for all time, but for the foreseeable future. That was before I stumbled upon Train to Busan.
In this south Korean film from 2017 we follow a young father with a boring suit that has lost the spark for life. He boarders a train with his estranged daughter. During the start of the movie, we have these pretty common clues about animals and people staring to act weird. In many ways Train to Busan follows the zombie film playbook. But I think it goes furthers with creating very heartfelt stories. One of the biggest possibilities there is with the genre is too elaborate with the characters relationships to each other and especially to themselves in a time of horror.
They succeed in this area many times, not just with the dad and daughter who are perfectly portrayed. We have this young baseball player and his girlfriend as the cute couple. Then there is a pregnant couple who works as the comic relief when together. But the man in this couple is very skeptical about our protagonist father whereas the woman is bonding with the daughter. The chemistry is priceless between these characters and it makes the whole movie. At the same time, it is one of the better action movies in a long time and the suspense is world class. I was sweating almost the whole movie."
" What A Film!
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,10,"Probably the best zombie film I've ever seen. I'd heard people speaking highly of it and finally got around to giving it a watch, and wow, I was NOT disappointed. Train To Busan takes the zombie genre to a whole new level!Instead of being your average, cheesy style zombie flick, it focuses on raw human emotion and paints a beautiful and almost poetic picture of just how heart breaking it would be to have to endure the horrifying experience of a zombie apocalypse.I enjoyed the uniquity of the story, the film is very well shot and acted, the zombies were well portrayed, the action sequences were well choreographed, it's honestly really hard to find something I didn't like about it, which is why it's a 10 from me! An absolute must watch for any fan of the genre!"
" Gripping
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,"A very gripping movie...with a bit of emotions
Definitely recommend for zombie movie lovers"
" Classic Z-Film
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,9,Loved every scene. Very intense and never a dull moment. A Film classic.
" One of my favorites!! Won't be disappointed
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,"I'm always skeptical going into new zombie movies Bc good ones just are made anymore most are B rated and the filming sucks. THIS MOVIE IS GREAT. Hollywood needs to take some tips for these people. They stayed within realm of what we know while introducing their own spin on certain zombie traits. Its has that edge of the seat, hold your breathe type scenes. It's got characters you can like and ones your screaming to kill already. Adding that it's on a train gives it a more be careful, watch where you go factor. I didn't quite catch how it started I'll have to rewatch to see if I missed something. For me it's a sold 9.5, one of my new favorites on up there with dawn of the dead (04), and this is just a me thing but it lost .5 Bc I wasn't as happy with the ending as I wanted to be but they brought it together wonderfully and respect their writing. So, go watch it!"
" Not your Grandma's Zombie flick
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,9,"This movie was a pleasant surprise. It's not just a zombie movie. It has characters you care about, a worthwhile plot and set pieces that make you feel claustrophobic and uneasy.
Its almost perfect. A few pacing issues and a couple throwaway characters but other than that it's a must see."
" Spectacular experience
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,10,"If you haven't seen this movie, you're so lucky. You are in for a great ride."
" Different, but works
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,9,"A great great film, full of smart sub-plots and good character development, and leaves you caring until the very very end. approaches the zombie genre with a keen and fresh eye, whilst also maintaining what makes a good zombie film, suspense and zombies. please give this film a go if you already haven't."
" It truly is the best zombie film in years.
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,9,"Back in 2016, this film took not just it's homeland, but the world by storm, becoming one of the most internationally successful horror films of all time. The fact that it was able to make the zombie sub-genre fresh again is a testament enough to what a great film it is, and it achieves this through focusing on the very aspect that more recent American zombie films neglect. And that is the humanity and emotional core of an apocalyptic event. The film's bread and butter are it's exceptional cast, and thoughtful writing. This isn't a collection of faceless victims lined up for the biting, instead you'll grow to genuinely care for and root for these people. Underlying the entire film is a message of selflessness, as the story confronts the life of a selfish businessman who must learn to put others before himself if he wants to save his only daughter. Through this, the film critiques the callousness and corruption of business culture and capitalism, without ever beating the audience over the head. Thankfully, it's just as good a horror film as it is a humanist drama. The infected borrow liberally from the ravenous, fast-paced flesh-eaters in ""World War Z"", but without that film's reliance on atrocious CGI. Thus the moments in which crowds of hyper zombies chase the cast through confined spaces are truly intense. And those more suspenseful moments are only made stronger by the well-written characters. It's a true masterclass in how to make an effective, classic zombie film. One that American directors should take notice of. A real crowd-pleaser that offers drama, character, emotion and adrenaline-charged horror all in one."
" Train to Busan
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Train to Busan follows some pretty simple character arcs and story beats, but it's so much fun and so well crafted that it doesn't really matter.There are some predictable key plot points from the beginning. We know the father, stuck in business mode so often he can't even remember what gifts he's given his daughter over the years, will become more compassionate and present by the end. And we know that the evil characters will get theirs before the credits roll. But you know what? Those are the kind of story elements that can be very exciting in the right place. I want to see evil people get what they deserve. I want to see the business man become a good father. And I want to see the kind hearted child survive despite the selfish adults who surround her. These are moments that have me cheering the movie on even if I kind of already know where it's heading. It's like a warm blanket covered in zombie guts. I feel comfortable and disgusted all in one.Even with all this said, the movie is undeniably exciting. Action scenes are well shot and never feel too closed in to see what's happening. This is a very real concern for a movie that takes place predominantly on a train.There was an honest sense of loss when some characters died too. While most of them were underdeveloped there were a few that I felt like I really got to know in just under 2 hours. I think that was mostly due to some really great performances. It's all in their faces. Dong-seok Ma knocked it outta the park. He came off so smug at first but then evolves into your manly, trustworthy dad who doesn't know how to change his ringtone. It's so good. Su-an Kim is another standout. She is so quiet and reserved at the start, then as things continue to fall apart around her she has so much opportunity to show a range of emotions like anguish and fear. She killed it. This is a great child performance.The cg and make up effects are phenomenal. Some that were especially impressive were the zombie movements and the zombie deer in the opening. They sometimes looked a bit off but that only added to the charm."
" Mind blowing wordless

" Masterpiece
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,10,World's best zombie movie... Best Korean movie ever watch.
" Genuinely impressed and satisfied.
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,"For once it's not a zombie movie where human vs human takes the spotlight from human vs zombie. I'm genuinely satisfied with the execution of the movie overall. the acting was superb along with the pacing. My only gripe is the slew of sudden character deaths at the end, most felt a little unneeded but they achieved the goal of making me sad. but that aside I genuinely had fun watching this, my heart was beating fast with certain scenes, and I was invested in the characters. I can even look past some of the obvious CGI since it isn't bad, just obvious. Honestly, it depresses me that it's this hard to come by a good piece of zombie media. They always take the main focus from the zombies to make it something like the nature of man or the origin of the outbreak. You see a lot of zombie media having evolved forms of zombies because the writers don't think flesh-eating zombies can keep your attention. save for games that usually execute evolved infected well. Essentially I come to a zombie movie/comic/manga/anime for the zombies, and I want my zombies, Train to Busan is one of the few if not the only one to do it right. Watch this movie, you won't regret it."
" The best
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a classic! Great storyline, acting, scenery, and scary moments! I will admit the ending will have you sobbing like a baby."
" The last train to Busan
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,9,"I haven't seen many Zombie movies, but Zombieland (Woody Harrelson) is one that ranks highly. So does Last Train To Busan, a frenetic and emotionally moving addition to the genre. The ending was very emotional, and you never really knew for sure which characters would survive the last stand. The special effects was incredibly impressive, and the acting top form."

Would be truly useful for this movie, as you watch protagonist after protagonist utterly incapable of running or reacting at all. Would like nothing more than to slap, like a pro, 97% of actors in this movie.Thanks for nothing"
" One of the best movies of its genre ever released
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,8,"Movie with zombies. I've seen a lot of movies of this kind, this is one of the top. Korean cinema, as always, invests a lot in emotion and is superior to everyone else. A film, slightly superior to which I consider only ""I am Legend"", which far exceeds the average of the genre. The train to Busan, a journey during which the zombie epidemic begins, and among the last passengers is an injured and infected. It's already too late after turning into a zombie. Where is it safest as the epidemic is underway? Inside the train on the move or outside? Survivors try as hard as they can to keep the zombies restricted in some wagons of the train, but for how long? An endless journey, where the destination is doubtful. Very good script development, building some characters, others with ideals, others altruistic and others extremely selfish. Who will finally manage to survive? Will there be justice? Very good performances, good direction and makeup, and a great ending, with a lot of emotion. Recommended to all fans of the genre, one of the best movies of its kind ever released."
" Wow!!
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,10,"This was definetly one of the best ""zombie"" movies that I have ever watched. Really good acting from actors that I haven't heard about. Big 10!!!!"
" Warning!! No zombies here!!?
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,9,"I loved, loved, loved this film. Cramming people and putting them in danger by trapping them on a train. Genius! My only objection is that they are not zombies!! Zombies do not sprint. Call them what you like but don't call them zombies. Still a great movie. Definitely check it out."
" Worth a watch but why so much praise?
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,7,"Very watchable but can't understand the level of praise it gets, good sets, enthusiastic zombies if a little over the top, average acting. Single viewing most likely."
" Eh
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,5,"Train to Busan is one of those biological disaster films that we have all no doubt revisited during the COVID-19 pandemic with a hyper-aware familiarity regarding the effects of a virus outbreak. I, however, found myself feeling the same unfazedness watching the film a second time as I did the first time. Train to Busan was branded as a horror movie, and yet I found its jumpscares and attempts at shock to be comical at best. With a main cast that felt like the amalgamation of the most generic character tropes possible, plus cheesy scriptwriting on par with the likes of Riverdale, it managed to place a sob story father-daughter relationship above the pressing conflict of a global apocalypse crisis. For example, in some scenes it is almost as if the imminent zombie wave in the background simply pauses while Gong Yoo's character and his daughter have a spontaneous heart-to-heart, or in other scenes the zombies blatantly go limp and allow themselves to be beaten to a pulp by Ma Dong Seok where they were previously rabid and ferocious.Beyond the awkward scene transitions and unrealistic fight scenes, the overall premise of a destructive virus outbreak turning humans into mutants was frankly delivered in the least creative way. Keeping the cast stuck in an enclosed space (a train) was probably one of the lowest hanging fruits in terms of a thriller-type setting. Having been an avid viewer of Korean film and TV, I like to think I can tell apart an original movie/series created for art's sake versus a movie made primarily for cheap entertainment or to garner tickets in the box office. This film, unfortunately, falls in the latter category. Painfully forced tearjerker scenes and the constant demise of everyone but the main character contribute to an overall tone of formulaic storytelling devoid of creative risks or surprises. Train to Busan is great fun if you're looking for surface-level entertainment on a Friday movie night. But it lacks any sort of original substance comparable to the previous film that lead actors Gong Yoo and Jung Yu Mi collaborated on, The Crucible (2011), which I would say is a much more worthwhile watch."
" Train to Busan' might well be the only apocalyptic zombie action-fest to be openly inspired by Charles Dickens's immortal Christmas parable 'Scrooge'!
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,7,"Director, Yeon Sang-Ho's almost absurdly locomotive 'Train to Busan' might well be the only apocalyptic zombie action-fest to be openly inspired by Charles Dickens's immortal Christmas parable 'Scrooge'! The doom-laden drama begins immediately after an allegedly benign chemical spill, along with massive civil unrest increasing exponentially there are wild & woolly reports of rioting across the country, and as the societal collapse swiftly spreads, various amusingly stock characters board the last train to darksvillle, along with one recently infected soul, who proceeds with laudable alacrity to scurrilously spread this especially vicious, bloodily viscous, universally eye-bleaching, zombie-making contagion! Unthinkingly aggressive, pack-like, dangerously nimble, this ferociously fleet-footed legion of relentlessly single-minded, flesh-craving savages makes for an especially unruly morass of terminally toxic humanity, and it will take all the available brawn, guile and collective humanity of our hastily organised zombie-resistance squad. A boisterous teenaged baseball team, an especially muscle-bound, Bolo Yeung-esque pugilist and his bulbously pregnant wife, a deliciously despotic, self-serving C.E.O, two immaculate, sit-com ready, octogenarian ladies plus the glacially aloof, hedge fund-manipulating estranged father of an implausibly cute, 'Spielbergian kid' desperately stave off this hellacious horde of hastily reanimated death, as their terror-beleaguered train wends its tumultuous 453 km journey to the hoped-for sanctuary of far flung, Busan. While the flighty film's non-stop, claustrophobic hysteria is frequently distracting, there's a singular sentimentality which felt incongruent; especially the existential, Dickensian emancipation of our handsome, young, estranged father protagonist, dramatically turning from callous, money-hungry 'Scrooge' to empathic, zombie-slaying super-dad! Another niggling irritant was the inevitable repetition of frequently frantic, door-fumblingly, 'oh-so narrow' escapes by our preternaturally plucky, carriage-bound protagonists, but, curiously, while only running at a lean 113 minutes, this celluloid exodus dragged on a wee bit, and could have richly benefited from some judicious editing, excising much of the saccharine sentimentality and enlivening the rather pedestrian script with additional fright-leavening flourishes of zesty repartee would have sped things along nicely, as more than once I could hear myself wearily ask the overwrought driver, 'are we were there yet?' 'Train to Busan' is a mixed bag o' rotten bones, while extraordinarily polished and well made, its momentary lapses of déjà vu, the timorous lack of practical gore FX and the film's grisly excesses of Spielbergian soul searching, perhaps, making this particular zombie apocalypse far more suitable entertainment for mainstream audiences than jaded, hardcore horror fans like me!"
" Remarkable, emotional, and exciting.
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,10,The anxiety I felt as this film progressed is immeasurable. Both the acting and the sets are perfect. The plot is seamless. I can't believe I just cried for a zombie movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
" What am i missing?
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,1,"I like zombie movies but i could not even finish this one... boring story, zero suspense. I see all the good reviews and i really dont get it."
" You won't forget this movie for a long time!
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,10,"I was at the edge of the seat throughout the movie, had high expectations with a Korean film and I was not disappointed. Some of the highlights were, quick and fast zombies, selfish vs selfless, Karma, emotions, sacrifice!"
" I expected a tasteless gore fest, but instead got to see one of the best movies I've ever seen.
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,10,"I would make this longer if I felt like it, but to really sum it up this film is a masterpiece. The Freudian symbolism and the moral critique of Korean society as a whole is what took the cake for me. This film made me care about every single character. The clash between the main characters Id and superego made a wonderfully developed protagonist."
" This is the best zombie film I've seen.
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,10,"A very realistic portrayal of human emotion, human actions and scary as any nightmare, this film blows modern day zombie attempts right out of the water. Anyone wanting to make a zombie film should watch this for reference, rather than following the tired and overdone ridiculousness of boobs, sex and stupid people acting stupid, making stupid decisions and deserving to die.I find movies set in a running train intriguing. The aerial scenes were very well shot. The cinematography is spectacular n the editing crispy. The film is loaded with tension n mayhem throughout. The best character is the husband of the pregnant woman. One helluva selfless fella.This is the best zombie film I've seen. The effects are incredible and the acting great, too - especially Su-an Kim (who was also fantastic in Battleship Island). The film is insanely suspenseful at times as we follow a divorced father and his daughter trying to escape the zombie apocalypse. Unlike most zombie films, this film has depth and emotion, and beautiful music, too.I highly recommend this movie to everyone, 10/10."
" Most entertaining zombie movie ever!!
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,9,"This might be all time bestWell at starting movie seems little dull and zombies don't look like zombies but after a time you gets the zombies and draws yourself into the movie.
Since the boarding onto the train, movie entertains you till the end.
Even at the end it's little more surprising to see now what?
After all we gets the bond between the father and daughter."
" A MUST WATCH!
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,8,"An emotional thriller which will not fail to keep its audience engaged until the last.
It has perfect mixture of emotions(especially the last scene will leave you crying). I really loved how certain small scenes also portrayed different emotions very well.
The casting is awesome, everyone has done the best job and correctly understood the character, especially the little girl has done fabulous work , having all expressions to the point. The makeup artists are also an important part in its success giving a real look of zombies.
The movie is not perfect as must I say because at some points the actions and decisions taken by the characters will really piss you off.
Even after certain mistakes in the movie, it is a MUST WATCH because of the acting, cinematography, makeup and screenplay."
" Rate 10/10
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,10,"An overall excellent movie
A friend of mine recommended this movie. In his words, it would be ""a kickass Korean zombie flick"", so naturally i went into this movie expecting another generic, dumb, goofy zombie splatter film. Boy, was I in for a surprise!First of all, the acting is spot on. All the actors are doing a tremendously great job, but for me, little Soo-an Kim totally nails it in one of the best child actor performances I have ever seen. The zombie actors are also truly exceptional and they manage to spook you, without having to rely on heavy prosthetics and rotting flesh.Secondly, the cinematography is amazing. Although the whole story is taking place during daytime, the film manages to make you feel claustrophobic and constantly nervous without having to rely on cheap tricks such as jump scares or low lighting conditions. The cuts are seamless, the colours great and, though different from Hollywood standards, it is a generally really good looking movie.What really captured me though in this film was the drama. In this genre the characters are usually very generic and one dimensional. Though this flick is, at first, not so different in this aspect, as the story carries on we witness the shifting between the dynamics of the characters, we see their personalities evolve and change, we find out about their motives, their relationships and the depths they would go for their loved ones. I personally found myself very emotionally invested to the characters (which might be due to the great acting performances),I was actively routing for them and was really moved by the movie's finale.Don't get me wrong though. This is not some melodramatic drama flick. It is still an awesome zombie apocalypse movie. It is fast paced, it is action-packed, it is gory, it is tense and terrifying and it will keep you at the edge of your seat. It is also original, it doesn't play around and will surely satisfy even the hardcore fans of the genre. However, it is also a film you will remember for its awesome story and characters and for being an overall great movie. 10/10."
" A near perfect zombie movie
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,9,"Some of the best films are from
Outside North America and this proves it. It's an almost perfect film from start to finish. It's non stop action from start to end. The characters are all well written and the acting is great. As zombie movies go this has to be one of the best zombie films ever made."
" I loved it
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,10,It was such a great movie. It was funny yet sad and was a thriller but not that scary. I loved it.
" Absolute masterpiece!
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,10,"Man, South Korea has got it going on! I happened on this movie randomly, completely unaware of its fame and awards offshore. I watched it simply wondering what is a Korean zombie movie like because I had been long over the genre and especially The Walking Dead. What I watched was character development at its most refined fineness.Seok-woo starts as a typical father working much harder at his job than at his relationship with his daughter. The quickly unfolding and non-stop dangerous turn of events reveals what is most important to him, and shows he is not cold, that he does have a heart. The flashback at the end...as a father, I cried.Sang-hwa's crass, rude nature initially paints him as a selfish oaf who thinks he's better than everyone else. The quickly unfolding and non-stop dangerous turn of events reveals that he is quite the opposite. He is selfless, has a great sense of humor, and is the kind of person you'd prefer at your side if you were dealing with a zombie breakout.What director Sang-ho Yeon focuses on is not the action or the scares, but the characters. How they respond to the circumstances that challenge their ability to survive and care for others is like seeing a flower bloom. I feel like his whole point of the movie was to make us ask ourselves ""Who are we truly?"" We got bogged down with our careers. We take relationships for granted. We act hardcore in non threatening situations. But what happens when hysteria and danger overwhelm your atmosphere? Who do you care about most then? What's the absolute most important thing in your life? I'll tell you again...the ending. Ugh, I cried watching a zombie movie!"
" A Solid Seven
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,7,"In my judgment, this doesn't ADD to the zombie genre as much as the reviews I've read suggest. Rather, it simply does it well. It is like a dancer who performs a classic routine incredibly well as opposed to one who expands upon it or develops a new style."
" Ridiculously tense horror
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,10,"Train to Busan is a ridiculously tense horror that's scary, visceral and surprisingly emotional with effective social commentary. Gong Yoo, Ma Dong-Soek and Kim Soo-Ahn are all incredible. Woo Sik-Choi, Jung Yu-Mi, Sohee and Kim Ui-Seong are all great. Yeon Sang-Ho's direction is superb, it's extremely well filmed and superbly paced, relentlessly tense until the very end. The visual effects are fantastic and the music by Jang Young-Gyu is excellent."
" Zombie thriller!
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,8,"This was a very good zombie action film filled with horror, cliff hanging suspense, heroism, humanity, and , of course, frustrating-- inhumanity.And the film's finale is a beautiful homage to the end of the original-- 'Night of the Living Dead'.'Train to Busan' is an excellent addition to the zombie genera."
" One of the best movies I ever watched
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie is awesome! Love it, it is one of those movies where you can watch for the second time after a while. Just watch it!!!!!!!!!"
" 4 nothing more
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,4,"I dont get why this Movie gets such a high Rating? Ah, after i scrolled through the Reviews it was clear. Almost all Koreans voted a 10 for this Movie! Yeah ok, it is finally a Korean Movie that you dont turn off after 5 Minutes, here you can stand 30 Minutes after you fell asleep. Thats a Huge Improvement in the Korean Movie Industry.
Many Reviews sayd ""A Korean Zombie Movie show Hollywood how its made"". Really? Every 30 Year old Zombie Movie from the US is way better than this attempt.The Main Characters are not likeable, not good actors and the Script is so poorly written, that the Movie felt like a cheap TV Movie.
FX are not good, Zombies are laughable, Story was ok.. Overall a not really bad Movie but nothing Great or good. Just a Ok Movie with unused Potential, and a lot of Hype that doesnt make sense."
" Characters decisions so frustrated.
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,5,So many nonsense scene like you runaway from danger but after you got in to save room in the train you didn't close the door; it is the first priority you should do when survival (always close the door make sure there safe and clear).Survivor try to make conversations with inflected instead pushing them of the train.And so many scenes thats characters decisions make me frustrated.
" Train to Busan ....still good to watch
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,9,I never tire of watching this zombie movie even though I'm not a fan of this genre....Well made with focus on relationships and a steady flow of tension and action .
" Very good zombie film
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,7,"I really like this even though I had to read the sub titles. Great zombies and characters and the acting was very, very good, especially the little girl. Her performance was truly amazing. Very rarely do you see such a talent in such a young child but she was superb. Well worth a watch and I normally hate having to read subs"
" FIRE
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,10,"The film is absolutely FIIIIIIREEEE!!!!
Watch it!!!
Also there's a anime prequel called Seoul Station if ya didn't know."

" Train to Busan is arguably the best zombie apocalypse film of all-time!
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,10,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Zombie apocalypse is far from being a groundbreaking subgenre. The Walking Dead franchise is arguably the most popular show on Earth when it comes to portraying this supernatural future. World War Z and the Zombieland duology play that role in the movies' realm. However, all of these works fail to reach the always high expectations that come with a story set in a time like this. When people ask, ""what's the best zombie apocalypse film ever?"", one doesn't have a clear answer simply because there isn't an outstanding, mind-blowing, near-perfect flick. Well, at least not until 2016, the year of release of the best movie in the genre, Train to Busan.I genuinely feel sorry for everyone who refuses to watch foreign films for whatever reason. A different language and/or the display of subtitles shouldn't be enough to convince viewers to ignore so many unique works from all around the world. If someone dares to call themselves a ""zombies fan"" and has not watched Train to Busan yet, then ""fan"" is far from being the right description. This is South Korean cinema at its best. Everyone is 200% committed to their role, whether that is a stunt man or one of the protagonists. Yeon Sang-ho delivers a powerfully suspenseful, intense, epic, and most of all, heartbreaking story with the help of a phenomenal screenplay written by Park Joo-suk.When the only ""negative"" aspect that I can find is related to ""maybe not-that-logical"" specific actions performed by some characters, I know that I'm nitpicking a near-perfect movie. I struggle to find a single real issue with the entire film. In my opinion, the reason why the latter works so well is largely due to Park Joo-suk's script. Usually, people always think about the zombies first: how do they look? How do they act? Do they run wildly or stroll? Which new attributes or skills do these zombies have different from what we've seen until now? How did it all begin? Is there a cure? Granted, the zombies look cool, and Yeon Sang-ho is able to create impressive action sequences filled with maximum intensity and extreme tension. Entertainment-wise: top-notch.However, the action only works as well as it does due to the emotional bond that the viewer shares with the (non-infected) human characters. These are beautifully treated and developed in such a remarkable manner. There are easily five to six characters that the viewer ends up caring deeply about. Typically, at least half of this group is expendable in this type of film because some characters show no signs of intelligence or are just douchebags. In Train to Busan, every single character possesses likable traits, besides being directly connected to each other (father-daughter, young couple pregnant). The action scenes are filmed in incredible fashion, but it's the encompassing emotional aura that ultimately elevates them.It's really an emotionally devastating story. The viewer is placed in dozens of situations that require the hardest of choices from the main characters. The generic dilemma ""do I save the person I care about or everyone else?"" is taken to a whole other level with exceptional dialogues, filled with an excruciating amount of suspense, leaving me about to tear up on more than just a couple of times. Every character has a terrific, compelling arc. The main protagonist, Seok-woo (Gong Yoo), goes from being a despicable character, one that I wouldn't mind seeing killed in the first fifteen to twenty minutes, to a lovable father that only wants what's best for her daughter, protecting her at all costs during the apocalypse.This movie is packed with clever social commentary, relatable to this day (and even more during the current global pandemic). Yon-suk (Kim Eui-sung) represents everything that's wrong with our society. A selfish man who thinks he's more important than everyone else due to his class and whose job is more significant than his own family or friends, let alone strangers on a train. He also works as a ""wake-up call"" to our protagonist, as a ""what if"" version of Seok-woo's future if he continues to only focus on his job. Another character of great relevance is Sang-hwa (Ma Dong-seok), a father-to-be who ends up protecting Seok-woo's daughter when her father can't. His bravery and selflessness make him an instant audience favorite.Technically, it's genuinely a flawless film. From the outstanding zombie makeup to the mind-blowing stunt work, everything action-related serves as evidence to prove that South Korean cinema does action a thousand times better than conventional Hollywood. The level of intensity is ridiculous. Lee Hyung-deok's camera work is absolutely brilliant, moving through the train seamlessly, letting the viewer see and understand everything. Aided by excellent editing (Yang Jin-mo) and a phenomenal score (Jang Young-gyu), Yeon Sang-ho generates tension and suspense in a way that makes every single action sequence feel overwhelming, powerful, and even epic.A runtime close to the two-hour mark that flies by. The first act perfectly sets up the apocalypse to come with a surprisingly subtle build-up of the exponentially growing chaos. Then, the outbreak in the train which occupies most of the movie's duration. During this period, everything happens. From the nail-biting action sequences to the emotionally powerful moments of character decisions that make this film so shocking. Finally, a third act that left me floored, completely drained of emotions, not knowing exactly how to feel after it all ended. Despite a couple of sequences that I believe were exclusively executed in the way they were to offer an emotionally climactic moment, everything else feels impressively realistic.All in all, Train to Busan is arguably the best zombie apocalypse movie of all-time, at least, until the date of this review. The subgenre finds in Yeon Sang-ho's mind-blowing flick the masterpiece it deserves. From the exceptionally subtle build-up to the emotionally devastating final act, passing through the most vivid, suspenseful, tense depiction of a zombie outbreak ever put to screen, Park Joo-suk's screenplay is the reason why this film succeeds so well. A heartbreaking story featuring astonishingly well-developed characters, surrounded by a powerfully resonant social commentary, even more in the current days. Action-wise, it's South Korean cinema at its best: maximum intensity, phenomenal camera work, seamless editing, chill-inducing score, outstanding commitment from everyone involved, and a fantastic stunt team. Hollywood should learn from movies like this. I can't find a single flaw. It left me emotionally drained. If you're a fan of cinema, no matter the genre, this *must* be on your watchlist!Rating: A+"
" Must watch
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,9,I had a great experience with the movie Train to Busan.It pulled you in the first five minutes in the movie and left you wanting to watch more and more.It cost 5.99 and it was worth every penny.Overall I had a very positive experience with watching this movie ! It had beautiful picture and such a good story and meaning behind it. I 100% Recommend this movie because instead of it being a regular zombie movie it's very different and unique to others.There were so many twists and turns that you wouldn't expect. This movie also teaches you very important life lessons and you leave the theater feeling satisfied. Great movie!
" Must watch!
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,10,"Just finished watching this (and whilst a few years later to the party) I can honestly say that Train to Busan was perfect. 10/10 easy. Amazing. Intense. Realistic but also controls a very confronting zombie-esc story line. Action packed from 10 mins in and never lets go. Heart rate went through the roof and in a good way. Powerful storytelling and for a South Korean film, amazing. I would 10000% recommend to anyone that likes thrilling and gripping films, survival stories, heartfelt daughter-father stories and a must watch for fans of the zombie genre."
" A FATHER-OFFSPRING RELATIONSHIP SAGA
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,9,"IT IS SAID THAT, BEFORE DEATH, YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MOMENT WOULD APPEAR IN FRONT OF US. WHAT IS YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MOMENT?A workaholic single father Seok-Woo (Gong Yoo) decided to give comfort his daughter Su-an (Kim Su-an) by visiting his ex-wife to Busan. They travelled to Busan by Train from Seoul which was, unfortunately, being victimised by a zombie apocalypse. Misfortune passengers became victim one by one. Someone's sister, someone's best friend, someone's daughter - indeed a pathetic situation. Seok- Woo and Sang-hwa (Ma Dong-seok) who also travelled with his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong (Jung Yu-mi) teamed up and tried to rescue as many passengers as they could. They faced lots of backlash not only from the zombies, but also from the living passengers as well due to shrewd and selfish behaviors of an evil-minded COO. The questions depict:
how many survivors would reach at Busan?
Would Su be able to see her mom?
Apart from the typical zombie horror genre, this movie shows the father-offspring relationship. The challenges that Seok - Woo encountered for his daughter and Sang-hwa for his upcoming child was precious. The movie perfectly displayed how an evil-minded top ranked official threw others into danger for the sake of his own safety even though those people wanted to save him! This movie also showed that being kind is always good and it would eventually come back to our life when we fall into utmost danger.
The acting of lead actors was great. The cinematography, the background music were also good.Train to Busan received Technical Award and Audience Choice Award for Most Popular Film in Blue Dragon Film Awards, 2016. It won Saturn Award 2017 in Best Horror Film category."
" Epic to the max
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,8,"I really rate this movie, it's refreshing to see such a great plot. The special effects are on another level, not cringeworthy, over the top like most Hollywood movies but very realistic and dramatic continuously throughout. I watched it thinking the next scene couldn't get any better only to be pleasantly surprised. It gets marked down because of many frustrating scenes where stupid choices and actions are made."
" Thrilling to the max!!
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,10,Thrilling to the max!! I watched it many times n would recommend this movie strongly.
" Fast-paced, Tension-filled, Best Zombie Movie
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,9,"The action is fast-paced, non-stop, and this zombie movie is hands down one of the best! If you feel you've seen enough zombie movies, that they are all the same-give this one a try. It will not disappoint."
" A wild ride
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,8,"Take a simple concept and execute it perfectly - that's what this film does. Trapped on a trail full of zombies, a father fights to keep his daughter safe. The action is non stop, the acting is impressive, there's just the right amount of humor mixed in to ease the tension, and they manage to pull off a satisfying, touching ending. You won't regret watching this."
" try harder to shock and thrill
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,1,"It starts with 20 minutes boredom. dialogues like: little girl: ""....daddy, I wanna travel alone...."" daddy: ""no, I don't allow...."". then it turns into a bad comedy, sort of a zombie parody."
" A zombie movie made me cry?
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie is beyond incredible. As someone who hates zombie movies I went into this expecting a few cool action scenes and nothing more. But boy was I shocked and amazed by what I saw.This movie is the only zombie movie I've ever seen that actually brought me to tears more than once.The characters feel so real and their reactions are the cornerstone of this picture. The characters do not react in your typical ""cool action movie"" way, blowing zombies away at every turn. No, they are afraid, they are confused, they are selfish, they are human. They react in the way real people would react in this kind of situation. Some step up and go after zombies, some stay behind in fear for their lives, and some are putting others in danger to save their own skin. The reactions and characters are so diverse and I'm sure if I went in depth, each one could easily represent an aspect of human nature in survival situations.The setting is perfect and the things that happen are as realistic as a zombie movie can get. A huge moving train packed with zombies, no way to communicate with law enforcement, and no way to see what's happening in the outside world other than the TV. The only thing they can do, is survive until the train stops. This mix of danger and being left in the dark creates tension that leaves you on the edge of your seat, biting your nails, praying for the characters safety.Speaking of the character safety, in this movie, no one is safe. I won't go in depth with the more gruesome moments, but rest assured, nothing is off limits. You truly get the sense that anything could happen to these people at any time.The emotional parts of this movie are also an enormous strength. Since the characters all feel so real and so thought out, whenever one dies it feels like a stab in the heart. Even when an extra dies, the acting is so well done that instead of the typical ""there goes another one"" feeling typical of zombie movies you get a feeling of dread, that's constantly encroaching upon everyone involved.All in all, this movie is a perfect example of what a zombie movie can truly be, instead of the same action star schlock usually made. I encourage everyone to watch it at least once, to experience one of the best movies of all time."
" Watch This!
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,10,"This is more than a Zombie movie, This is a Masterpiece. I'm not saying this because it had gore, action or horror (it has all of those) I'm saying this because it had heart, Being from the usa I had to read the subtitles (Worth it) even still this movie made me care more about its characters than 90% percent of movies I have seen. This movie is not for the faint hearted however if you are 13 or older this is a must watch. This is on my personal top 10 movies. Watch this if possible!"
" amazing
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,9,I never thought that there will be such an amazing zombie film in my lifetime
" Not your mainstream zombie movie
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,9,"This is probably the best dramatic zombie movie. I m not a fan of zombies tbh, but this movie made it look so real that you feel for the leading actors. The drama is on point with a father and daughter relation in the heart of it. Train to busan is worth watching."
" top 3 zombie movies ever
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,10,Seriously jam-packed action zombie movie ... great actors and cinematography ... wow! solid 10 for the genre
" Entertaining
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,8,A chemical affected world sees the murder of thousands ... a protagonist husband and wife supporting their fellow human beings but that little girl is disappointed. Soon we come to know the truth and try to bring balance to the infested land... Nice story and screenplay and that teenage girl acted so well and did not just rely on her magnetism... nice twist at climax.. Watchable movie.
" LOVED IT!!
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,9,"I am a zombie fanatic!! I love MOST things zombie. I like scary zombie stuff, things that look real and could be believable IF zombies were real. This movie DID NOT disappoint!! I was little worried reading subtitles but soon got into it and didn't bother me. This was a heartwarming, scary, GOOD zombie film. I hate when they add comedy into something that is suppose to be scary and this did none of that. The main characters were great!! The little girl deserves an award!! Probably one of my favorite zombies films. I did watch the second one and regretfully didn't finish it but that's another review. I'm one that it HAS to be really good for me to watch again because I'm not big on rewatching movies but I would watch this One again!!"
" Kinda Reminds Me Of Dead Rising. In Other Words, It's Insane!!!!!
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,8,"I explicitly refer to Dead Rising in this instance because this film certainly gets so far out of hand when it comes to how many Zombies appear in here. I once saw this on Netflix and I was rather stunned at how impressively well-constructed the concept, plot, and character interactions turned out to be.It's as simple as a train ride to another part of Korea gone awry due to a Zombie Infestation. Most of the main characters do quite amazing work at staying alive. But as you'd expect, the majority end up dying eventually. Even the Main Protagonist ends up biting the dust towards the end of the film. It just goes to show that the Hidden Gem of some Underrated films is something totally different than the average Hollywood flick from the past to the present."
" One of the best zombie movies I have seen.
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,8,"I will put Train to Busan in the top zombie movies with Dawn of the dead (1978), 28 days later, Shawn of the dead and Dead Alive.Train to Busan was the first korean movie of the genre to get international recognition and success. Now with Parasite and Kingdom (Netflix original series) the korean movie industry is slowly starting to get the some attention."
" South Korean Film Industry is the Next Big Thing!
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,7,"What differentiates ""Train To Busan"" from the rest is its immaculate character expansion & a profound piece of social commentary!
It may insinuate as another generic Zombie feature but trust me when I insist it's more than that.'Zombies' when you hear the word, you may be prodded by the never ending Resident Evil Franchise or some individual ventures by Hollywood studios! No matter how you got your firsthand experience with this type of Horror but I'm certain; you either have lots of fondness or a box full of disgust for these.
Zombie Movies have always gained traction from audiences'. Especially for its exaggerated Tonality. Albeit a tried & tested formula for box office success.
Yet most of the times makers get it totally wrong. They fixate so much on its extravaganza that they kinda forget about fundamental nuances.'Train To Busan' is evidently diverse in that case. Crafted by utmost maturity, this not only showcases usual tropes of the Sub Genre but also provides an underlying Socio Political attire which considerably indicates our Class partite society.
All of the characters in here, portrays distinctive thoughts and ideologies! They all come from different backgrounds resulting a versatile input into characterization aspect!
Their convincing acts had helped in that regard as well.
The storyline showed its efficacy in emotions! Teared me up good, not gonna lie.
Cinematography is great, for a South Korean production they undoubtedly nailed on the technical front.Except the Soundscore!I might be in the minority here, but the soundtrack didn't seem impressive to me at all! It felt highly incapable of generating fitting emotions in certain sequences!
I'm not saying it's trash; could have been miles better though!
Another negative would be its marginally stretched screenplay which caused its necessary momentum to break oftentimes.
It also had inconsistencies throughout the plot in terms of writing & detailing.
Bearing in mind possible spoilers, I'm staying away from any sort of explanation but you will understand.Still I can comprehend all of your affection for it! This is more than a mindless Zombie execution which had strong sentiments underneath unlike any iterations we might have watched previously."
" i loved it - review for school pls ignore ty
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,10,"The end of the world. It sounds scary, right? When we think of the end of the world some people think of an asteroid hitting the earth. Others think we might be the reason for the end of the world. Another one would be zombies somehow become a real thing and we all eventually die, fun right? Train to Busan is a zombie thriller movie that follows Seok Woo, his daughter and other passengers trapped on a bullet train in Seoul, trying to survive while an outbreak of zombies is beginning. The movie has comedic moments to terrifying moments that have you at the edge of your seat with your heart racing, wondering what happens next. I did laugh many, many times. But I also cried quite a lot, for a good amount of time but I digress. While just meeting these characters, you just can't help but care and get a soft spot for certain ones. But there are a few where you just can't bring yourself to like, no matter what. I know I certainly couldn't like a few of them. But whether you like them or not, they still have you chewing on your fingernails, wondering what comes next.
As the title says, they are on a train heading towards Busan, South Korea. As most of you know, South Korea is known for its clean big cities, mostly polite citizens, and just all around a nice place. Well those once clean and advanced cities turn into these bloody, terrifying, and dangerous places. Even before all the chaos happened, the beautiful scenery was shown just before it became bloody. You can be enjoying a nice little moment while suddenly boom! The complete opposite is shown right in front of you. I will admit I got jumpscared quite a few times. And you can bet that it will be full of bloody, neck-biting monsters.
The very first thing that you see is a man driving and he suddenly runs into a deer. Unfortunately, the deer does die and he drives off after. But what he didn't see was the deer standing back up, after it had died. Now I won't describe every single scene so a little later we meet Seok-Woo who lives with his mother and daughter, Su-an. But he really doesn't spend that much time with them since he does spend most of his time working. On his way home he lets it be known that Su-an's birthday is the next day so he buys her a Wii, but what he forgets is that he had given her one for Children's Day, yeah yikes! At this point I know I didn't like him very much, you're just wondering how could he forget what he gave his daughter for Children's Day. But, Su-an is obviously used to her father not being the most attentive father out there, wants to go see her mother in Busan. She calls her mom to tell her and begs her dad to take her or to even just let her go on her own, which would be crazy! Given that Seok-Woo had messed up once again, he agreed to take her. At this point you do feel bad for Su-an, I know I did. While there is no doubt that she loves her dad and grandmother, she just wants to go see her mom. Who knows how often she sees her, and when it's your birthday you want to see both your parents, if it's possible. So they set out to Busan the next morning.
On their way to the station you get a glimpse of the city and the emergency vehicles headed to Seoul. Ignoring what's happening in Seoul, they arrive at the station. Here is where you meet the rest of the characters. Two elderly sisters, a pregnant married couple, an awful businessman, and a baseball team. Everything is fine and everyone gets on the train but since this is a zombie movie, at the very last moment a visibly ill woman gets on the train. I honestly don't know how she got in without anyone else seeing her. I would have left that train so fast! In the matter of a few minutes, the train gets full of these violent killing machines. As we can all expect, everyone freaks out and they run, but once they figure out what's happening we have a few of them fighting back for the safety of themselves and the other passengers. Personally, in this situation I can't say for certain what I would do but I like to think that I would help the people around and at the end that would hopefully lead them to help me back. You have to work together to survive this. But Seok-Woo does tell Su-an, ""At a time like this, only watch out for yourself."" At the time he definitely believed this but as time went on he knew that this isn't something he should be living by or teaching his daughter. There certainly was a time where I thought the same thing, every man for himself. But it has become clear to me, that is not the case, just like Seok-Woo. Now, obviously I won't spoil anything but the survivors only survived because of the sacrifices of others.. And the selfish ones met their demise because they didn't think of anyone else besides themselves.
Before I watched it I heard many people say that it was an amazing movie they would recommend it to me but I just never got to it. Now that I watched it, I really do regret not watching it sooner. I honestly expected it to be like any other cliche zombie movie or tv show out there. It really did not disappoint at all. I liked everything about it, the characters, the plot, the way it was filmed. With the way that it ended, I certainly did not expect it at all. But I actually really did like it. Now I would express myself more about how I feel about it but I would be spoiling it so that is all I will say about the ending. Another thing that I also found interesting was the way that the zombies moved. When you think of zombies you think of them as these slow but deadly monsters. You don't usually think of them as these super fast zombies, but then again these are fresh, newly turned zombies so you definitely have to keep that in mind while watching, I know I would forget that every once in a while. Also the way they moved was pretty different. They were like spasms. They would jerk around super fast. Once again, I would 100% recommend this movie to everyone. It may not be in English but that's not a good enough excuse to not watch it. We have to expand our experiences, and not limit them to just what we know. This Korean movie is incredible! It also left me wondering how well I would do in a situation like this one. How would you do? Would you survive or would the dead consume you."
" BEST zombie film out there
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,10,"This was easily, EASILY a 10/10. The film keeps you on your toes while also being incredibly heartfelt. Teared me up, which is rare for me. The action is solid. The characters are relatable, engaging, and believable. There's truly nothing bad to say about this film, except maybe that the ending is a bit of a downer, but if they ended it differently the film might not have had the same impact overall."
" Excellent as most Korean productions.
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,10,"By the time there are a lot of zombie movies out, and many of them fail to impress. And it is understandable, how can a movie be interesting if there are hundreds of movies about the same topic? Well, this movie, thankfully managed to impress and keep my eyes open every single second. As most Korean productions I have seen, special effects are top tier. The plot is not only about people running away from the zombies, but it tells a particular story a little bit different from what we are used to see on these movies. And, oppositely to what we are used to watch or expect on zombie movies, Train to Busan provides a soft moment that touched my heart and made my tear-up a little. This is not just another zombie movie, this is one that I really and highly recommend."
" A lot of brains for a zombie flick
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,8,"An emotional and terrifying dissection of what it is to be human. Social satire competes with melodrama and gore into this frenetic South Korean horror triumph. Movies about the undead have essentially been built on a foundation of fear of our fellow man. Yet TTB takes that a step further by building on the idea that, even in our darkest days, we need to look out for each other, and it is those who climb over the weak to save themselves who will suffer. Performances are outstanding all around, especially from the young Kim Su-an who incredibly makes every nightmarish scene seem utterly real."
" Quality Zombie Flick
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,8,"This was a good zombie movie. I was quite surprised. You end up caring for quite a few of the characters, and end up really despising some, ones that you wish die horrible deaths.A fairly simple and normal zombie plot. There's a virus or infection in Korea, people get bitten, turn into scary fast zombies (28 Days Later like), and mass chaotic fear breaks out. But with this story, it's mostly all on a train while trying to reach safety. This creates whole new level of anxiety as the options to survive are limited. I got vibes of Snowpiercer, but obviously with zombies.I enjoyed this film because it made sense, it was based in reality, nothing was over the top or exaggerated. As a zombie flick, I would very much recommend."
" A perfect zombie movie
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,10,"This movie is simply perfect, I can't find a single thing wrong with it, I highly recommend."
" Too generic and stupid
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,5,Such a good film but my frustration is 10/10. Everyone made such dumb moves and decisions. Can't stand it. I've seen too many of these. Jesas.
" Not good... BRILLIANT!
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,10,"From start to finish this film is near flawless. Great character build up with 1st class acting. A very scary story although zombie movies are now 10 a penny. This one certainly has that something special.
The acting by the little girl Su-an Kim was outstanding. What an emotional performance. I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie. If you think you have had enough of zombie movies watch this one. It's more than a cut above the rest."
" Non stop action, fun, intelligent and hold on to your popcorn!
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,10,"As with all Parks movies this is simply great!
He's a fantastic Director and I cannot wait to see what he does next."
" Decent zombie flick
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,6,"Finally decided to watch this after years of seeing it highly rated in the genre's must see list - for sure what seem subpar dub/subtitles didn't help enjoying it, anyway it was a reasonable ride, with a passable plot, good zombie animations (the way they contort limbs was original and effective) and some nice characters to root for.. Ending was OK too.I wonder if the ones rating this an 8 or more have watched 28 Days Later, and if so how they've scored it, 12? For me it's a 6 1/2, but anyway if you're a fan I guess it won't disappoint."
" Best zombie movie ever!!!
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,9,"Maybe I am this hyped about this movie because I just love the way Koreans make movies, but this movie is amazing . I am a big horror fan but NOT a fan of zombie movies. This movie is different and will have you on the edge of your seat and get your feelings involved weather you like it or not. I think I cried about 3-4 times while watching this movie. The ending was also very good."
" Well done with feeling!
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,9,"We have waited to see this as it wasn't in English. We assumed it wouldn't be good with subtitles. We were so wrong! Excellent film not horrific like other movies, more of a thriller-drama. We loved it! Had the zombie thriller part with the human feeling as well. Watch it you won't be disappointed!"
" Aloha 'oe
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,9,"If you like ""zombie,"" films, as I do, you are sure to like this one. As in any drama you must identify and care about the characters. Plenty to care about here. Some original zombie action themes added to the enjoyment."
" As far as Zombie movies go, it's got high production values, but low oringinality
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,6,"I'm tempted to give ""Train to Busan"" only 5 stars, but I'm upping it to 6 due to it's extremely high production values. The best thing I can really say is that it's probably got more than enough blood and gore to keep zombie lovers happy. After reading so many really positive reviews, as soon as I noticed it was coming off Netflix, I rushed to watch it immediately. I really wish I hadn't bothered. ""Train to Busan"" is no more than a rehash of countless past films--everything from the ""modern"" zombies to the old-fashioned moral lessons. There's nothing original or thought-proving at all. It's basically a Hollywood popcorn feature emphasizing a tighter social and ethical code (like, say, how we idealize our own society of some decades ago). ""Train to Busan"" isn't bad, it just wasn't the phenomenal viewing experience I was expecting given the reviews or the shockingly strong films that sometimes come out of Korea. Frankly, I don't know what so many other people are thinking. For my tastes, although very slick, ""The Train to Busan"" was simply too long and too ordinary and too blatantly emotionally manipulative to be worthwhile or memorable."
" The movie is realistically a 5.5
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,3,"As a Korean or Asian zombie movie, I get it that it is a rare production done relative well. But in a larger scheme of things and comparing with all the zombie movies that have been done to death especially in Hollywood, this movie is AVERAGE. The zombies are unoriginal and so similar to World War Z, this might as well be a called World War Z: The Busan Contagion.That Korean cinema touch of inserting emo moments to every genre is just so cliche, worn out and in this case applied without much thoughts. Going through the day chased by flesh-eating zombies, your body is so flooded with stress and adrenaline, tears of sadness are the last thing that will flow out from you. And let's not get into the many many unrealistic and even unintentionally comical scenes.Movies above 7 in IMDB is usually worth a watch. This is not one of them. Those who rated this 10, please do yourselves a favour and watch more movies outside of Asia."
" Awesome Zombie Flick
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,9,One of the best zombie movies I've watched. The zombies were done very well and the story is captivating.
" Infectious family movie.
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,9,A very well designed zombie movie. Showing love a man towards other people and love of a man for her wife and daughter.
" Somewhat Illogical movie, but will keep u glued
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,5,The kind of movie where you can justify reason to yourself for the time spent watching it.
" Best Zombie movie of all time!!
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,10,"Simply this is the best zombie movie you will ever seen. This movie make me cry every time I watch, very emotional and has the best unexpected ending."
" What a ride!
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,10,"WOW! What a ride!This is brilliantly directed very touching movie with lots of memorable scenes that will haunt you for a long time.This must be one of the best zombie apocalypse films ever. Highly recommended!I haven't seen Train to Busan 2 (Peninsula), but I can't wait how the story continues."
" One of my favorite movies
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,10,"This movie, regardless of genre, has become one of my favorites. At first it seemed a little bit cheesy, but after watching it all the way through, it's very comprehensive, and logical. I absolutely love the young star who plays Su An. I have watched this numerous times, and it is suspenseful, and great every time! I recommended highly. As an added bonus, it is a Korean zombie movie, and right now, that is unusual!"
" Breaths life into a ""dying"" genre
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,9,"Zombies have become so oversaturated in our culture. It has gotten to the point that zombies are just not scary anymore (thanks Walking Dead...). I just don't know if anyone could do anything new with this genre anymore until I watched ""Train to Busan"". The simple premise is that ""A divorced father Seok-woo, his estranged daughter and other passengers become trapped on a speeding train during a zombie outbreak in South Korea"".Let's talk what this movie does differently from previous zombie movies of the like. Firstly, the movie has the zombie stuff for the majority of the movie in an enclosed and cramped train. The claustrophobic nature of the train leads to some tense situations and even creative scenes that you wouldn't see in other zombie movies. For example, there is a scene where characters have to stealth by the infected in the dark and one where the characters have to punch there way from one cart to another. On that note, these action scenes are phenomenal. They are all thrilling to watch and always kept me on the edge of my seat. The zombies in this movie are very World War Z inspired but they are not just some mass of CGI. The zombies are phenomenal extras who manage to capture the essence of what a scary zombie should be through freaky body movements. Props should also be given for the makeup team as well because the zombies look as disgusting as one expects.Another element this movie does very well is the characters. Every main and supporting character stand out in different ways and each has vastly different personalities. The main character Seok-woo (Gong Yoo) is shown initially as a cynical workaholic who barely spends time with her daughter Su-an (Kim Su-an). Throughout the movie, he is selfishly just thinking about himself and his daughter but the character arc he goes through feels natural and believable. By the third act, you are rooting for him to succeed. The supporting characters in this movie are also great and each fully realized. My favourite has to be Sang-Hwa (Ma Dong-Seok) who is a tough and burly looking man who is trying to protect his pregnant wife. However, despite his demeanour, he is the one who puts himself at risk to help others, is the one who also provides the light-hearted comedy and is the one that pushes the development of the main character into a better person. He also has some of the best moments in the entire movie. Another stand out supporting character is Yon-suk (Kim Eui-Sung) a COO of some large business. He is absolutely the worst person in this movie as he is willing to sacrifice anyone just to survive and incite people to his cause. Major props to the actor for giving such a great performance in absolutely making me hate him. All the actors in this movie do a terrific job but I do have to give a mention to Kim Su-an who plays the daughter as child actors tend to be mostly a missed but Kim Su-an succeeds in the emotional moments and is a hit.While the story isn't something unique, the emotional moments and its social commentaries set it apart from something like World War Z. It's surprising but this movie explores a lot of the human nature of people. We see characters who want to do anything to survive, and others who will try to save others. The real main conflict that happens on the train is the clash between these two types of idealogy. We mostly watch our main character go from the survival idealogy to helping other mindset but the director also shows people who go from the opposite direction. There are also a lot of subtle commentaries sprinkled in this zombie movie tackling class warfare which is noticeable in the second viewing. The director also uses this to subvert expectations of characters like some who look shady or mean will be completely different. So this zombie movie is definitely not brainless"" and is another reason it's so different from others. Sang-Hwa says in the movie ""it's all about the sacrifices"" and this is where the emotional core of the movie lies in, the main lead having to do whatever to get his daughter to Busan. I won't spoil anything but this movie really hits hard and it won't be surprising if you tear up at times. On top of these praises, the score by Jang Young-gyu is really good as well. The composer makes some sharp sounds that really elevate the creepiness of the zombies or intense scores for the cool action sequences.If I had to give this movie a flaw then I have to say that some of the characters do make dumb decisions near the end. It just feels like it was senseless and silly which can take some people out of the movie. Additionally, the final act is very green screen green and has a lot of noticeable CGI which can be a little distracting.Overall, Train to Busan is one of the best zombie movies to come in the last decade or so. The movie breathes new life into a ""dying"" genre and also tackles unique themes on classes and moral polarization. This is a definite must-watch for everyone, especially those who love zombie movies."
" The bad reviews must be fake
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,8,"Can't imagine someone giving this movie a score under 7, this should be one of the most unboring zombie movies I've ever seen. It's not about zombies, but humanity. People that are old enough to think should relate to the drama part easily and the message it's passing.The final 15 minutes was really emotional, and I didn't expect it to be so pronounced because I already got the ""message"" throughout the entire film before the last bite started. The movie would still be good even without the last part, and probably more balanced emotionally."
" Excellent
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,9,"Great Movie ,I really enjoyed it . A sure sign this was a great movie is that i watched it all the way through from start to finish without getting distracted ,which is really rare for me as I'm very easily distracted and loose interest quickly . I recommend this movie. Hope you enjoy it as much as me"
" Full of Action...Thriller!
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,9,"This movie has taken the zombie apocalypse to a new level ! It has the Best fight and suspense scene and packs a lot of horror and exhilarating feel ! I recommend to watch this at least 2 or 3 times to properly enjoy this movie , Great Movie !!!!!"
" Dull
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,5,"Zombies and zombie movies are a dull concept in the first place and if you have seen one, you have pretty much seen them all. There are some rare exceptions that manage to stand out, but chances are that with the second one you come across it gets a bit tedious unless for some reason you are a fan of this stupid genre. This here is not one of those exception, it falls heavily into the ""yawn, seen it all before"" category."
" Close the door please!
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,7,"I was going to write a review about some inconsistencies like unnecessary final ""boss fight"", different timing to turn into a zombie depending on the character, still getting shocked for seconds when a character see a zombie even after he saw 100 zombies before, freaking cold protagonist etc. And of course beautiful visuals , cgi and very good script.But then I read about some reviews and everyone is talking about that cool schoolgirl and I laughed so hard and still laughing. Maybe I'm laughing because I agree somehow. Let's say God bless cool Korean schoolgirls :)"
" Very good for a horror film
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,8,"I was completely kept thrilled throughout the 2 hours of watching this film. Almost all details are to be significant to some later events happening in the film. I was in utter and peaking disgust when it came to the scenes where the COO rat used other people's lives to save his. This movie did not just bring up intense actions, but it also implied some life lessons by portraying how selfishly some may behave when disasters occur. Totally recommend this film to everyone if you are not too scared of bloody scenes."
" even a hater can eat this
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,10,"If youve read the grumpy old mans reviews on zombie flicks, youll know that this is the lowest prioritized genre on his behalf. but this is a south korean film, therefore i had to view this, cause i admire korean films.as the title spells , its a train ride story , not an easy peasy one, rather a zombiyotic one, just to make a humble presentation to it. these zombies do not behave like the generic and stiff shoulder and paralysed stumbling legs spescies, its a juicy athletic, gymnastical variant of the kind, not friendly in daylight but calm in the dark.many train films do have the issue of the one location syndrome, but having seen train to busan i feel like ive been into every excisting loophole to everywhere during the 115 minutes of playtime.productionwise its darn magic from start to end, the intensity and speed of development are just staggering and breathtaking, the actors are familiar to us viewing lots of south korean action movies, but they ,and the stunter's are doing marvelous stuff on the silver screen. the cgi are spot on and the recipie simple, if your bitten its done.the score, which is a great component of the grumpy old mans filmexperience is just excellent and helps the plot and action amplified into something more. its a strait 10 with a recommend"
" zombie survival

" Pretty good
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,8,I was sceptical at first when I saw this movie thinking it would be low budget and a tad boring but I was definitely wrong it is one of the very few zombie movies that is quite decent. Despite it being in a different language it's still amazing with all the gore and heart gripping moments in it.
" Train to disaster
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,5,"*zombie about to bite a main character*Main character: but I'm the main characterZombie: ohh yeah rightttttMain character: yeahhhhZombie: understandable. Have a great day. 🤙
I mean come on, whenever it was the main character the zombies suddenly changes their behavior, slow when they are needed to be slow, fast when they're needed to fast. I'm not impressed with some of the acting, their reaction doesn't go with situation at hand. I mean some of them saw an actual zombie eating someone but their facial expression is as if that person is looking at a wall. And we didn't get an actual explanation as to how the virus got out in the first place, we were just told that it started from a biotech comp - not enough!Why were they at first mocking the lead character for being selfish eg for closing the door before the couple enter and the guy even said "" I ThInk YoU ArE OwE Us aN aPoLoGy"" like seriously?, I mean he was being selfish at an acceptable level considering their situation. Talking about selfish, there was this other guy he was self-centered almost to the point of being annoying. I believe he's the second bad guy right?
And why do people 'change' to zombie at different rate, one guy got bitten it took him only seconds to change but when it's the main characters they have a minute or two to say some few lines before they change.
What teen girl are the other reviewers talking about? I mean I didn't even notice anything worth mentioning there. I remembered she was there after seeing some of the reviews lol.
The movie is entertaining tho. it's non - stop action from beginning to end but that's just it."
" Great Movie!
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,10,"The movie was overall GREAT! The qualities of the movie were excellent! And to be honest there's no bad things I can say about the movie, All I can say is that it will get so emotional at the end. AND THATS WHY I LOVE IT!"
" Birthday Trip Turns Into Escaping To Busan
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,8,"Dad is divorced and argues a bit with his ex on the phone. A little girl who is so cute and I love her perfect adorable voice wants to go to mom's for her birthday. Dad got her a gift she already has. The girl lives with her dad and grandma.The two of them board the train and we see various stereotypical types of people - the jocks, the cheerleader, the elderly sisters, the hurrying man in a suit, the conductor, stewards, etc.The girl from Wonder Girls comes on the train to the pleasant excitement of the boys in their baseball jackets and bats. She sits next to one of them.The little girl is innocent and does what is morally correct. Dad tells her that in these situations it's every man for himself but she still wants to be the nice girl. The little girl associates with the other passengers notably the pregnant woman and her husband and the two elderly women who she gives a seat to.The man points at his wife's belly and says, ""I made that."". His wife gives him a look and he says it is true.Information is scattered, no one really knows what is really going on and the government isn't informing in detail. It is literally Darwin's theory about whomever is competent survives. Physical strength, quick running, attention is all tested in fighting and running from the zombies and not being bitten by one.The little main group comprises of Gong Yoo and his daughter, one elderly sister, the pregnant woman and her husband, and the cheerleader's crush. I love this group but they die off one by one, turning into zombies. We see a selfish man, the hurrying one who only cares about himself convince the crowd to block the door for our main group. The other elderly sister looks at her poor sister who has turned into a zombie and opens the door, letting the zombies bite everyone.The train track is blocked from a fallen train and fire. Gong Yoo, pregnant woman and the little girl escape on to another train. Gong Yoo is bitten by the selfish man and lets himself fall off the back of the train. The woman and girl walk through a tunnel where the military wait at the other end to see who comes through."
" The little girl in this movie....
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,10,"Is amazing. I usually don't like child actors too much, but she's incredible."
" Not Worthy of the Hype
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,4,"Maybe it's because of the excessive hype surrounding this supposedly groundbreaking zombie film but I was disappointed with this. This film feels like an unofficial World War Z remake in South Korea and not in a good way. There's really nothing in this film that separates it from others of its kind. It may be South Korean but it definitely feels like a typical Hollywood blockbuster.First big problem with the film are the unearned attempts at drama and tears. It's extremely melodramatic with too many attempts to touch your emotions and pull at the heartstrings, and it doesn't work because these characters are flat and disposable. They barely get any character development and are mostly just stock characters: the corrupt capitalist businessman, the dumb teenagers, the annoying kid, the hobo who speaks about the end of days, the damsel in distress, and the everyday man. They're the most one dimensional horror characters on the face of the earth who only exist to fight zombies and get eaten. I think it also says a lot that many of the positive reviews here only praise the cheerleader for being hot and not because she's a compelling character.Plus I found the ""don't be selfish"" aesop to be forced and poorly executed. It'd be one thing if the lead character had to learn over the course of the entire film to be more selfless and help other people as part of his path to become a better person but no, that little character arc is dropped in an instant. instead we get a hate sink character in the businessman who's presence beats us over the head with how selfishness is wrong by having him do increasingly despicable things just for the sake of it. He's not a character, just a token attempt at inserting forced and contrived conflict into the story.How to fix this? Cut down on the melodrama and remove the corrupt corporate executive and tramp characters. They're both annoying cliches (the homeless and filthy looking freak speaking about the end of days and the apocalypse has been done to death). Let the zombies be the villains for once in these movies instead of using that dumb ""maybe humans are the real monsters"" cliche."
" Train to Busan is a must see!!
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,10,"There's just something so special about this movie. It's introduction to characters is done in a special way and at a good pace to make you almost feel connected to them. I, personally, didn't care if the zombies were slow or fast, or even if you'd consider them zombies. Their relentless speed kept me on edge the whole movie! It definitely displays the effects of ""Selfishness vs Selflessness"" and the ""Collective vs the Few"".
It's just such a beautiful movie that doesn't get the recognition it most definitely deserves!!Side Note: On the date of me writing this review, (8/16/2020), Train to Busan is on Netflix but if it's not when you view this, it's definitely worth the purchase. You won't regret it!"
" A best zombie movie.
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,10,Watched it in Korean language with English subtitle. Still it was great fun to watch this one. Nice direction and train made it fun to watch. Nice acting by.all the actors who were alive and who eventually became zombies. 😉
" Overall great movie
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,8,"I don't normally watch foreign movies, but this one I sat through from beginning to end. I knew I had to read subtitles throughout and I did not mind at all. This film had action all the way through and did not drag in the beginning. It had meaning to it as well. Highly recommended for those who love zombie movies."
" Korean zombie horror told with skill, aplomb & utter poignancy
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,10,"TRAIN TO BUSAN (2016) **** Yoo Gong, Yu-mi Jung, Dong-seok Ma, Su-an Kim, Eui-sung Kim, Woo-sik Choi, Sohee, Soo-jung Ye, Myung-shin Park, Gwi-hwa Choi. Relentless zombie horror film from Korean filmmaker Sang-ho Yeon (who co-scripted with Joo-Suk Park) where an outbreak occurs while a train is en route from Seoul to the titular town with an atypical cast of characters (harried father with daughter in tow; pregnant woman; baseball team; dickhead CEO) that is given flesh and blood turns by its talented cast (you root for everyone amidst the horrific carnage unfolding). The claustrophobia mixed with sudden dread is altogether palpable and incredibly poignant."
" one of the best for a zombie disastrous film, good cinematography
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,9,"The 4-5 year kid acted fabulously, selfless caring characters are shown nicely, there is one selfish rich man also.
engaging film and the end it gets emotional when the father gets infected and dies."
" Great Zombie Film
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,8,One of the best Zombie films since World War Z. This film is non-stop from the beginning to the end. Very intense and lots of blood. The acting and story telling is amazing. Worth the watch.
" Too long
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,5,"Well, I've never liked any zombie movie, the reason they don't explain everything well. Now this movie has broken all records.
No explanation as how it started. Some infected transform in seconds, others take long time. Those two stupid granny sisters seemed like terrorists to me. Good guys or bad guys, all get killed, doesn't matter they're kind or helpful. I don't get how morality is encouraged here."
" Worth Watching
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,7,"I get the feeling that this is one of those 'must watch' films, even though I probably wouldn't set it apart from some of the really good films that I have seen in the past. Yet, in a way this film has a uniqueness that I really do appreciate, even though it is basically a zombie film. However, the scenes where the zombies are literally falling over each other in a massive horde really does make it pretty scary at times.Yet, a part of it also has a lot to do with the characters, and the various motives that each of them have. Further, considering that it is a zombie film, it is one of those 'last people standing' types, though you can pretty quickly work out who is going to remain standing at the end, namely because there seems to be this unwritten rule in films as to who is allowed to die, and who isn't.So, the film is about this Fund Manager who has to take his daughter to his ex-wife. They are in Soeul, and she is in Busan, which is basically the other side of Korea (and while the movie suggested that it was only an hour, I checked Google Maps and it suggests that the trip takes something like two-and-a-half hours). However, things really start going pear shaped as the train starts to take off. There are hints as to what is going on, but when it happens, it really happens thick and fast.I guess one of the key things about this film is how people react in moments of stress. Or moreso, how people act when the world starts collapsing around them. For instance, we have this struggle between doing the right thing for others, even though it might result in you suffering for it, or looking out for your own skin despite others suffering. The fact that the main character is confronted with this dilemma, and challenged throughout the film, is one of the things that really sets it apart.Another interesting thing to note is how being selfish can actually be a downfall in the end. For instance, in the scene where it is a choice between rescuing a couple of people, and saving themselves, their act to save themselves and let the others die results in all of them eventually dying. This also brings me to the point of how doors are used in this film. It may not seem like much, but in a way the question of survival really comes down to the use of doors, and whether you open them or not. Some are opened, others are broken down.I guess this is where the subtle references to class warfare come about, because the only reasons that there are classes is because there are doors, and these doors and closed and locked. Yet, in another sense this whole concept of class really only exists to keep the hordes at bay, and satisfied, since opening the door will result in you being overwhelmed. It is also interesting how in a group there always seems to be one who rises to the top, and then uses this position to further his own position, no doubt at the expense of others. It does show how fragile it really is, since all it takes is for one person to open the door, and everything comes crashing down."
" Fantastic
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,9,"Going in to this movie I heard some hype but really I wasn't expecting alot, but when it was over I sat there speechless. This movie truly has a fantastic sense of thrills that make you hold your chair tight when watching. This movie uses it's shots and space the best way. One of my favorite zombie films in the last couple of years."
" Coolest movie with a best story
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,10,"I love this movies, here is why i like this:
Action packed
A moral to teach us humanity

" Great zombie movie!

" In a zombie apocalypse, the Koreans are just as stupid as Americans.
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,5,Would have been a lot better if the main charachters had some commen sense. That goes for 90% of horror movies but damn. I just can't believe people are that dumb. I might be wrong though.
" Action, Heart, Drama and Morality in One Awesome Zombie Flick
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie is my favorite zombie movie ever it had all the action you could possibly want in a train at a station and it felt like a mashed version of Snowpiercer mixed with World War Z. In a movie that had heart between the dad Seok-Woo and his daughter Su-an and their journey to Busan to go see his ex-wife and her mother for Su-an's birthday. On the train we get working-class man Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeon. Sang-hwa was my favorite character in this movie and brought laughs and awesome action and strategy to a really scary movie. Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee, elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil, and a homeless stowaway. All the actors and actresses were great and Seok-Woo went from unlikable loan lecher that only cares about himself into a really kind and awesome father. The ending gets me every-time, and the entire film your wondering is everybody going to die? Who is going to survive the cinematography was great, the directing great, action great, zombie violence great, this movie had everything."
" Not only zombie
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,9,"Train to Busan is more than a zombie movie.
Also is about how important is a woman in our life. And about
selfishness and individual versus collective.
It is about the triumph of human life and the sacrifices necessary for human life to continue on earth.
It's easy to say that woman symbolized life in this film. In fact, the survivors are a pregnant woman and a little girl.
Because, life without women could not continue. This is the end that gives us hope for survival.
In ths movie, we are offered almost all the important representations that a woman can have, that of a wife, represented in the film by the pregnant woman (Seong-kyeong),
the one of the daughter represented in the movie by the little girl Soo-an, the one of the friend represented by the character Jin-hee, the two older sisters (possible grandparents)
In-gil and Jong-gil. Of these, only the first two survive because of the sacrifice that men from their lives, makes.
One of the two old sisters dies due to the selfishness of another interesting character Yon-suk, but the other sister sacrifices herself to avenge the death of her sister.
Jin-hee also dies because of Yon-suk and her boyfriend sacrifice, although he could very well have saved himself.
Yon-suk turns out to be a loner with only a mother waiting for him at home, hence his selfishness, to reach her at any cost, even treading on corpses.
The importance of women is often emphasized through the sacrifices made by those around, but especially because they are the foundation of our survival as a species. I didn't gave 10 because of some goofs, but really it's not so important.
This is a worth to watch movie!"
" Just More than amazing
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,9,Number one zombie movie from Korea but l like More action Z movie More than a simple Z
" A Masterpiece
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,"Just saw this for the first time on Netflix. It has instantly entered into my top 10 films of all time, maybe top 5.It's tough to gather my thoughts, but my biggest takeaway is that this is a film about the importance of persevering through fear to protect what and who you love the most, even if it means that you become the victim to a an unthinking mob. It's about having the strength of character to do what is right and sacrifice yourself for your family and friends and to fight to the death against odds you know are impossibly against you.A very inspiring father-daughter story set against a backdrop of a zombie apocalypse happening in South Korea, Train to Busan is much more than just another zombie movie.Something I also liked that this movie pulls no punches and respects for the viewer's intelligence. The characters solve problems through clever means. There are no deus ex machina elements present. The gore and violence is shown with a disturbing steadiness rather than being over the top. The zombies themselves are portrayed moreso as humans with rabies than anything else. They don't run super fast, they don't have super strength, and they are not exceptionally durable. In this sense, the zombies are more believable. The female characters in the film are not endowed with Hollywood-ized GIRL POWER. Some of them do demonstrate bravery, but scenes are not written purely to push feminist agendas.The acting of everyone in the film was great. Exceptional credit must go to the little girl who plays the daughter of the lead actor. She was amazing and executed every scene she was in perfectly.Highly recommended."
" Mubi Marathon
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,8,"I am not usually a fan of action movies, so to speak. They're formulaic and predictable, with eye-rolling story beats.This movie was definitely formulaic.HOWEVER.Do not get me wrong when I say, that once in a while... Someone comes along and takes the ""formula"" for pulling emotion from the audience and executes it to perfection. Train to Busan does exactly that.It takes every single trick in the book (might as well be a two hour edition of Robert McKee's ""Story"") and puts them all together, nicely wrapped in a bow of constant-zombie-action-engagement.You end up so engrossed in the action that you forget that you're taking in incredible story beats and an impeccable character arc that makes for a massive emotional payoff.Great acting. Great underlying social commentary. Great direction.This premise, if executed poorly, would have made for a super cheesy film. It wasn't executed poorly.Watch. Learn. Feel."
" WHY ARE PEOPLE CONCERNED WITH THE ""CHEERLEADER?""
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,10,This movie was so good that i don't see how many of the comments are about the cheerleader or schoolgirl. The entire story is scary and sad. The action is top notch. This movie is definitely top 5 with other Zombie films. Right up there with the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD. Instant classic.
" Immy's review : The best zombie movie
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,10,"This is by far the best zombie movie ever made. The film is not only filled with fun zombie action, but also strong emotional turmoil, social commentary, character development, a look at our relationships with others, and the selfish nature of humankind. It was truly revolutionary in creating a zombie action movie with real depth and emotion. The movie gives a subtle but clever introduction to our main characters, most primarily Seok woo and his daughter Su An, who have a rocky relationship in part due to Seok's selfish nature and his inability to spend time with his daughter. Already this creates a intriguing relationship between Su An, who cares for others, and Seok, who says she must only look out for herself. This forms the basis of a strong development not only in Seok Woo's character, but also his bond with his daughter, who he soon finds out loved him much more than he previously thought, so you only fall more in love with their relationship. His character development was strong and well presented, practically showing him redeeming himself and distancing away from his selfish ways, progressing from anti hero to hero, all because of his daughter. I think this is what the made the movie stand out from other zombie movies. It purposely makes you form strong attachments to all of the main characters and their bonds with others, who, despite being at different stages of their lives and having different goals, are nonetheless loveable due to their apparent selflessness and their desires to protect the ones they love. This made the deaths much more heartbreaking. The acting was phenomenal from every actor, most notably from Gong Yoo and his daughter. It honestly baffles me how a child so young could act so well and demonstrate so much emotive pain, you would think she was genuinely a distraught child. The movie was extremely gripping and tense at times, with the just right amount of pacing, lighting and music to create a terrifying suspense throughout. The movie made the zombies genuinely horrifying, as demonstrated by their violent consumption of humans and most notably, their fast running...eeek. The ending made me weep like a baby, as we are left with a much better understanding of our main characters and the dire consequences of their selflessness. It was genius how emotional and isolating it all felt by the end, and the heartache you feel is immense. The movie does such a good job at gripping you and truly taking you through every event, emotion and turmoil, that by the end your heart and your head are exhausted. A true rollercoaster of a zombie film. Highly recommend!"
" ""Survive This: Train Edition""
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,9,"Fantastic watch, will watch again, and can definitely recommend for those looking for a new zombie movie to watch.This one really had me yelling at the screen: I was heavily invested....until I was basically emotionally exhausted. I don't think I reacted quite how the director wanted me to react during that last act.This is a fascinating premise. A zombie outbreak that leaks onto a train (with just one infected), and these are ""World War Z"" running, 15 seconds to turn (usually) zombies. I'm staunchly against running zombies, but when you do something well, it is really hard to discredit you for it.There is one aspect that is truly odd for zombies, but it would be quite the spoiler, it's basically the 3rd act (out of 4). The writing structure feels very different, it doesn't seem to adhere to a 3 act staple: it really feels like 4 acts broken into chapters (or levels similar to a video game) and as whichever characters survive the transfer from chapter to chapter, the story progresses. There is clearly though pre-infection establishing act, post infection establishing act, confrontation act, and resolution act. Once you get past the first act, it's pretty much non-stop action, by the by.The one frustrating part about this movie is that most of the characters seem to have a death wish: despite trying to stay alive, they all seem to want to die. I understand that a story can't happen without flawed characters, but the things these people do are so remarkably stupid sometimes that the zombies become more believable at times. It does allow for some of the more amazing scenes though, so it might be somewhat forgiveable.This movie is honestly so good, I really feel like I'm reaching on any of the complaints."
" Bored the train
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,2,"I wanted to give up after 30minutes due to boredom but persevered to 60 only because of its high rating.This movie is dumb. The zombies are obviously sped up and move SO fast and in huge groups, unless they are attacking a main character. Then they are slow and weak.Some of it is funny because it's ridiculous. Not sure if they intended it to be funny.I read alexkatt review and he/she said it perfectlet."
" A Must Watch for a Zombie movie lover
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,8,"Okay so it does have some slightly problematic parts but what zombie movie where scared people have to make decisions doesn't? It's thrilling, full of action, WWZ like zombies. I didn't expect to cry however, never cried in a zombie movie before. Worth your time to watch!"
" Not quite satisfied...
",2020-07-22 00:00:00,5,Train to Busan scores a 7.5 snd World War Z a 7...this is a joke.
" train to busan
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,8,"Train to busan was a great change in a already very stoic and familiar formula and koreans were able to make zombie film to feel brand new and fresh,that is maybe because we are not watching some random people fighting the infected on a streets on some city but rather we feel connected to all characters that are put in a very awkward situation in a very claustrophobic train,when we talk about fight scenes and chases they were made in a very good way,acting was also very good expecely since this genre isnt know very much for great acting,in movie there were two great scenes that i will remember for some time,first one is in beginning with deer and second one when infected were trying to climb train,train to busan is defienetly one of most fun movies about infected people or zombies but it lacks more quality to be on par with some old classics"
" By far the best zombie movie ever
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,9,"You get really invested in this rare zombie movie, learn to care for the group of people that runs from a zombie apocalypse and fight, not only for their own lives, but that of their integrety as humans as well, and of course for their loved ones. It is a movie of love, and hope and ultimately faith.
I give 9 out of 10. Had wondered to give it more to counter the strangely bad reviews, but that would ultimately defeat the purpose of this site.
Why don't I give it a 10? Because it is ultimately a zombie movie."
" Excellent zombie flick
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,9,"Higky recommend, gooacting and story was a fresh approach. But geez this one is a sad one."
" Simple yet masterful
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,10,"Honestly one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I normally don't go for any action films without comedy. Every moment was compelling and every death was disheartening; I found myself yelling at the screen every 10 minutes. The ending, too, was probably the biggest tear-jerker of the year for me (and I can't believe it came from a zombie movie!!)Also, people here keep objectifying the cheerleader and putting down the pregnant woman. A) they are both beautiful and B) stop being creeps jeez just watch the movie."
" Best zombie movie ever imo!
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,10,"Being a fan of the horror genre and seeing how overused and cliched the zombie movies was getting, it was really awesome to see a fresh and entertaining idea for a zombie apocalypse. For something that could have gone down the roads of snakes on a plane this movie was wayy better than many of the zombie movies out there. You have very great actors who you can get behind and root for. You have the loving husband, a father, pregnant woman, cheerleader, college brats and you have the greedy selfish capitalist a-hole of a CEO. The overarching theme of selfishness and selflessness, survival and panic is all a key part of this movie.This movie was incredibly entertaining, really heartfelt with every character having a wonderful arc with some truly emotional scenes which is something you normally don't get in a zombie movie. I really recommend you watch this especially if you love the horror genre. 10/10 movie for me"
" Unbelievably bad
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,2,"It takes complete suspension of disbelief to enjoy it. Apart from the strong moral lesson, this film has the perfect combination to ensure a cinematic failure: script peppered with inconsistencies, little character development, poor acting, excessive wailing."
" Everything you're expecting and much more.
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,10,"Train to Busan goes from a family drama, to a zombie horror, to an action movie, and closes with the most powerful cinematic climax you've ever seen in a movie of this genre. The climax is so powerful and so sudden I couldn't even prepare to try not to tear up, it just happened. The transitions between genres blending this masterpiece together are seamless and are the backbone of its over all success.While there are a few character moments you could call questionable, if you really think about it, some people are just dumb enough to be even more irrational and stupid when fear takes over. So something that you see and go 'i would never do that!' well, maybe you wouldn't, or maybe you don't realize you might in that situation, or the person next to you might.It becomes a character study part way through, at which point you realize, the villain of the movie isn't the zombies.Over all, if you can handle the heart crushing devastation, don't miss this movie."
" A Roller Coaster of a Zombie Flick.
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,8,"Korean filmmakers show that a quality

" The perfect zombie film we've been waiting for.
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,7,"THIS IS CAT!!!!!
Anyway,intro's done.
Train to Busan(why is it called Busanhaeng?),is a film that effectively establishes an emotional connection with the viewers,with great character arcs,a tense and well-constructed plot,masterful acting by the protagonists,well-done morality and social commentary,all building up to one of the best finales of the decade.
Of course,one can't overlook the perfectly shot action,with zombies that are actually,antagonists and aren't overshadowed by the humans(equally brilliant).
Overall this is a film that entertains and tears you up at the same time,while
maintaining thrilling and tense throughout the whole film,without falling into the pitfalls of it's predecessors."
" Good movie, disrespectful reviews
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,8,"I found the movie enjoyable and well made. The father daughter relationship and the motives of other characters, despite being cliches, work in this film. The plot is sincere in its portrayal of events without being ridiculous or overly serious. I really really liked it.
On the other hand, I invite the reviewers to show some respect to the women in this film. This schoolgirl/cheerleader conversation created here is just sexist and disrespectful. It is not even a big plot point , one of the characters being a schoolgirl, so what? I thought teenage (underage probably) girl fantasies were unwelcome in this post ""me too"" era but apperantly many people still think the other gender only as a ""gift to men"". That character has an important role in the film other than wearing a short skirt but some people can only see that.
Just disappointing."
" I'm so annoyed!
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,6,"Ok the film was really good and all, but seriously I am so MAD at the ending! The story ends on main characters dying! Truly heartbreaking :( So many questions are left unanswered as well! Just because the two of them survive the problem, doesn't mean the problem is solved! How do they solve the problem? By killing them all? Finding an antidote? This could also be a good thing however, a strategy, leaving the audience hungry for answers to their burning questions. For me, I like happy endings, where everything is solved, so I wasn't too happy with the ending. Maybe we can get a sequel?? hehe."

" Hollywood please take notes.
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,9,"First let me say all these reviews with dribble about the women is just that..dribble. Its a shame that's all they saw and missed a fantastic movie in a genre that is well overly saturated with hot expensive garbage. Granted it's story told many times with character archetypes used again and again in the past, but here it's done almost perfectly. You start to love the people here trying to survive, cry when they pass, and cuss at the screen when the villains get there way. Great acting, diaolog, and cinematography. If you love this genre then please watch this movie. Can't wait for the sequel.Also check out Kingdom on Netflix. Korea really has a handle on zombie drama😆👍🤘"
" It's ok, nothing special
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,6,"Really, you can only describe this as pedestrian, even though it's on a train, pun intended. Same old tropes you've probably seen before. It's the equivalent of a pamphlet as opposed to a book. Maybe I'm just jaded."
" What a great movie.
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,10,"What a pleasant surprise this was. If you're into zombie movies and can deal with subtitles, this is the movie to watch. You fall in love with MOST of the characters and you can't help but root for them. The cast was incredible. I think anyone who watched this just witnessed an up and coming star in Kim Soo-Ahn who played the little girl Su-an in the movie. Dont let the subtitles steer you away. You get used to them."
" A wonderful zombie movie
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,8,"The spectacular action and scary violence to the screen the entire time. The hatred and evil comes from the hordes of infected and one's fellow man. Quality is high, the action is non-stop and the freshness in a worn out genre is amazing!
To me, the movie was a treat!!!"
" Herky-jerky zombies keep one in constant peril!
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,8,"I don't think I've ever cried during a zombie movie, but now I have! The father/daughter subplot just killed me, and the tears rolled toward the end. Dang zombies...Fraternal emotions aside, this is a darn good zombie movie! Zombies on the train make for a lot of stressful situations and crazy conditions! And these zombies movie in a disturbingly herky-jerky way that really freaked me out! Especially the female attendant toward the beginning! And that dear at the start! Yikes! The story, such as it is, it filled with constant peril and the characters are never at peace. And neither was I...Aloha Oe..."
" Dull
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,6,"I just don't get the high ratings in some of the reviews. This is a dull movie. People get bitten, bite others and they try to bite others. There's some dumb, cliched moralising & a disturbing scene where a child seems to be far too realistically distressed. I love Korean movies and this one maintains the usual high production values, but that's about where it ends for me."
" Good Zombie Movie with a message
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,8,"This was quite a good entry into the zombie genre. And there are moral messages tied in as well. It's a bit over dramatic, but it's very well done."
" Do not waste your time
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,2,"Not too original, but as one reviewer said: ""Frustrating, inconsistent, illogical, cliche, completely lacking in tension. It's bad.""I would add that it is really bad. People are only getting emotional and nothing is even enjoyable."
" A zombie flick with some extra character development
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,6,"Not a huge fan of zombie/disaster movie genre in general, but thought that due to the direction this could be an interesting take on it. Though the characters all had a little bit of depth, and the setting of a train was fun, the movie did just boil down to a zombie flick: 1 dimensional characters that do everything you expect (greedy COO, all-sacrificing masc-dad, hopelessly in love teenage boy, matronly and caring pregnant mom), tons of impossible to escape scenes, and death of nearly everyone except for a chosen city of people. The relationship between the father and his daughter was the most interesting, seeing his lack of empathy and the ideas he was teaching her about selfishness flipped on their head when disaster struck made for a nice (albeit cliche) arc, but other than that the film was just ok."
" Brutal and visceral action combines with very subtle messaging to ensure the perfect ride, always assuming you are not on that Train to Busan
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,9,"I guess this might be referred to as a 'popcorn movie' in as much as it doesn't set out to change the world but just entertain, trouble is I'm just not sure at what point you would have the time to grab a handful and amidst the mayhem there are moments of seriousness and cause for reflection, especially in the midst of our own, very real pandemic. Director Sang-ho Yeon was known for animated films before plunging into this immaculate and superior example of the action movie. There is a brief introduction with scenes of work and private life showing considerable signs of strain even before we plunge into the most devastating and excitingly constructed runaway train with zombies. I guess they are not really zombies but persons rapidly infected in such a way as to display zombie like symptoms. Cleverly we are introduced to the main characters and then shown in terrible and frightening clarity the bloody and warped reality of such a victim. Such is the detail and believability that when more and more and even more are so transformed we are only too aware of the detail. Indeed the director's animation background makes him perfect for using (I assume!) CGI in such imaginative and convincing ways we really believe piles of zombies and tumbling over each other like great waves of living dead. At two hours the film is just about right and I think, looking back, that the reason this almost single set film maintains its momentum so well is partly that it is so well shot. The imaginative use of the camera, as well as the editing, help enormously, as does the restrained but effective emotional involvement achieved through minimal but well judged dialogue between the main protagonists. Brutal and visceral action combines with very subtle messaging to ensure the perfect ride, always assuming you are not on that Train to Busan"
" Very creepy, tense from start to finish.
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,9,"Packed with raw emotion and intense zombie mayhem. A truly great, wildly entertaining zombie film that hits all the right notes; great premise, great characters, great performances, and great filmmaking. Train to Busan (Busanhaeng) is a revitalization and a must-see for fans of the zombie genre."
" Thrilling
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,8,Intense and very enjoyable film. Love the acting throughout and enjoy these types of zombie movies
" I dont like zombie movies
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,10,"Honestly I've never liked a zombie movie before now, but this movie was amazing. It explained the outbreak better than most in this genre and the acting was great."
" Such a treat. Must watch for zombie lovers.
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,10,South Korea nailed it with zombie films/shows. So far I watched this film and TV show - Kingdom. Both are 10/10.Something different from US and I'm loving it.
" Perfectly sad story, but only one thing..
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,7,"As you watch the movie everything is great, except one thing Yon-suk. How things progress we all get to hate him more and more and even get excited at one point, but the worm crawl out just even more hated, near the end of the film everyone would throw him from that locomotive, but not Seok-woo and he paid that in most unimaginable way. I felt bad for Su-an (even got the tears out when she sing at the end) and got me thinking..she didn't get a proper ending, not even knowing if her mother is still alive. Hoping for some connection in the second movie, but because of those few things I can say that I was angry at the end, mostly at the producers whole vision, but while movie was still running also at Seok-woo."
" Zombies
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,8,"I don't know what some of you are on about, but the first zomvie we see in a Romero film, 1968's ""Night of the Living Dead"" (the ""Cemetery Zombie"") not only runs but picks up a rock to try to smash the car window in. And whoever said they're only zombies if they've been buried? The Cemetery Zombie had also never been buried. All they really have to be is reanimated dead.. Clearly some of you have no idea what you're talking about."
" A Lesson in Genre Film-making
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,9,"The movie does not have a single jump scare.The previous statement is the most important thing other film-making industries need to learn tout-de-suite.The acting is stellar. To be able to make a young girl that age, emote at that level is something I have not seen in a movie this kind ever!Why not 10 stars? The ending could have been cut-short by about 5 minutes. That is the only flaw I could find with this one.If you like such movies, this is a must watch."
" Great film.
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,9,"Wow, great stuff, slow at time and predictable at times, still excellent. One of the best zombie films ever watched. Action packed throughout and interesting characters you get attached to. An unique take on the zombie genre, with fully developed characters, high stakes, impressive action and visuals, social commentary, and plenty of thrills."
" How a post-apocalypse zombie movie should be made
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,8,"Through years I have watched many movies and shows about zombies, but after ""Train to Busan"" I think I will have many difficulties to watch something else related to this genre. This 2016 movie is something unique and original.First of all zombies here are truly scary, they are fast and dangerous and if someone is catched, will probably die. Most characters are likeable and it is easy to bound with most of them, but the movie does not make any discount, if someone has to die, he or she will die, no matter how good he or she is. The movie starts off slowly, in order to introduce context and characters and then buildup gradually the tension.The movie is hard to watch, not for his violent scenes, but because it managed to create a pretty convincing and realistic scenario, if a virus of this kind would exist in our world. Basically this movie was able to accomplish what many other shows were not able to do in years."
" Blue Shirt Guy is Awesome

" Very good movie

" Arguably the greatest zombie movie about
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,10,I'm not a fan of Zombie movies and was a bit unexcited to watch this...but this is edge of the seat thriller...the south Koreans seem to get things right...Hands down up there as the best Zombie movie about.
" Horrifyingly Awesome...
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,10,"""One of the best movie that i watched in my Life""How come this movie is below 8 imdb rated. I found some people commenting on cutties. Korean teens are always sexy, but this is horror thriller so you have to switch your mind to be seriously interesting. People should start looking at their faces. This movie is one of the best Korean in my list. Don't miss this & don't give a damn to the reviewers. Just go watch it. I'm Waiting... for Peninsula."
" Entertaining, Simple Story!
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,7,"While the film lacks originality, it delivers a simple story about a father and daughter trying to escape a zombie outbreak in a very entertaining way! And that young daughter played by Kim Su-An does an excellent job conveying emotion, as a young child hurt by divorce. There's plenty of action and entertainment and the film will keep you watching."
" What a great movie 👌🏾
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,10,"What an excellent movie, full of suspense and it will keep you at the edge of your seat the whole time. Great performances from these guys especially the little kid. This is a a great story with good direction and really recommend it, can't wait for the sequel #Peninsula."
" Nice zombie apocalypse film
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,9,"Nicely paced visually action packed with nice set pieces, could do alot worse than this in english so well happy considering it was subbed and korean. Personaly like most i am not one to watch a subbed foreign film,but occasionaly one stands out as worth a try and this one did not let me down, recommended to anyone who likes the genre, even if like me they do not usually want to watch a subbed film.
Looking forward to watching Peninsula which is the follow up to this film and due out soon, covid permitting."
" Something different for a change with Zombies
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,8,"Between The Walking Dead & every Zombie film under the sun, Train to Busan isn't overtly cliché. It does start slow, but for good reason. The suttle build up was a great idea because of the tense & life threatening moments are at every turn for most of the film. Besides the outside world, being safe or trapped on this train made made it a new situation facing a zombie outbreak that was done very well. It's fun to watch."
" Finally a good zombie movie.
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,7,"This isn't your typical zombie film, there is a lot of great cinematography and great music score. There's also a lot of depth to characters too. The action scenes were great. Definitely a good watch."
" Well that broke my heart!
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,9,"Excellent zombie movie! And terrifying in a way that would make it really stink if this happened in real life!
Action packed! And easy to read along! Because it is subtitled!
But man, that movie is good! Great actually!"
" The longest train ride in the shortest time
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,6,"Train to Busan is directed by Sang-ho Yeon and follows a father and daughter on a train to... well, Busan. Only there is an infection that spreads and makes this train ride a little more stressful than the norm. The film starts a little bit clunky and unintentionally funny, with a shot of a zombified deer looking directly at the camera just a little too long. Just enough to make it feel accidental.The plot is familiar: a zombie infection/virus/bio-weapon that causes sweeping destruction and forces people to find safe zones to hide out until the threat is contained or eliminated. It's all familiar stuff. The father-daughter relationship is well-defined in a short amount of time, nothing surprising, but it works. The first infected on the train gets on a little too luckily for my liking, slipping behind a worker in the loudest and most conspicuous way and he doesn't even look. And she stumbles around the train with veins popping out and making noises the whole way through. Again, no one notices. That initial zombie is functional as a catalyst on the train and works to get the story where it needs to go.From the first infection on the train and beyond the tension is held, but not the pacing. There's lulls where time is given to think about what happened prior; which should be effectively emotional, but there are only really 5 main characters, and some of them don't get much in the way of characterization. And there are also some situations where the tone feels a bit off. Jokes are present but it's difficult to discern whether or not they're supposed to be out of nervousness or just bad writing. The writing of situations is well done for the most part, but there are characters such as the man in a green jacket that serve no purpose and only exist to up the ante.Train to Busan has some interesting ideas such as zombies only being attracted to people when they can see, the survivors using newspaper and darkness when in tunnels to navigate. When the darkness ends, the zombies immediately know where the characters are. This would be great if it was consistent. Other times it is made to look like the zombies are attracted by only noise. There are moments where the zombies should be attracted to characters but aren't for the sake of the plot. Infection times fair the same way, sometimes it takes minutes for someone to turn and other times it's instant. It seems as though the zombies only follow the rules when it's convenient or to set up tension that doesn't need setting up. Aside from this aspect, the zombies are conventional and well-explained.Technical aspects are mostly solid, with lighting and camera work capturing the scenes fully and competently. The sound is appropriately gruesome with each bite, bone-crunch, and punch being felt. There is clearly some CGI used in some sequences and most of the time it sticks out like a sore thumb but it never takes away the impact of the film.Performances are harder for me to gauge with the film being in Korean (a language I have no experience with and there are no parallels to English) but from the emotions being shown by each character were fitted to each situation. Sometimes the characters make supremely stupid decisions that, again, are only made to raise tension when it is already high.As a whole Train to Busan makes for an engaging yet familiar ride. The film has good ideas but is inconsistent with its usage of them. Everything is competent and mostly unsurprising, but entirely watchable. If you like zombie movies this will probably be for you.63/100"
" Amazing
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,10,"Loved every minute of this movie. The acting, plot and cinematography all came together to make a phenomenal masterpiece."
" Great film.
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,8,"This was a high action, great film but the ""school girl/cheerleader reviews are so gross that it makes me scared for the world. Heaven help us..."
" Astonishing good a nonstop zombie ride..!!!
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,9,"This movie has it ALL! I'm going to dive a lot deeper into Korean horror. Side note, I'll definitely cry every time I hear the Aloha song. Maybe even at Lilo and Stitch. One of the best zombie movies I've ever seen!"
" nice
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,8,"The reason why zombie movies are attractive is not because of the zombie itself, but because of the rapid outbreak of the zombie virus, which can cause a region, a country, and the entire world to fall into an extreme state of eschatology in a short time, and a few people who survive Being quickly thrown into an extreme environment from a polite society, they must not only survive in an environment where predators are everywhere, but also deal with the crimes that broke out in human nature after the sudden failure of modern politeness."
" Okay, maybe not a ""true zombie"" movie, but wow, did I love this movie!
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,8,"Train to Busan is a movie about a father who is too busy to really care about his daughter. He and his wife are separated and his wife lives in Busan. His daughter wants to see her, so they decide to take a train there.A female passenger dives on board just before it leaves. She's been infected by some sort of virus. She infects one, then another gets infected and so on until the train starts to get taken over. A small group of non-zombies try to survive all the way to Busan, a supposed safe haven where the zombies haven't yet infiltrated.So, first of all, I suppose zombie purists have a problem calling this a zombie movie. They weren't resurrected and they move fast. These are more like the World War Z, 28 days later zombies than Night of the Living Dead/Shaun of the Dead zombies.But aside from that pedantry, I found so many things to love about this movie
* the way they split the train into two factions that ended up turning against each other.
* the last scenes with the father dying, remembering his daughter being born and smiling, then cutting to the shadow of him falling off the train.
* the creative tension as the smaller group works their way to car 13. Each car is like a level, and each level has a different challenge. First it's just fighting, then it's fighting a car full of one of the character's classmates, then it's realizing they can't see in the dark and so follow sound, then climbing above the zombies. Each scene was tense.
* the fact that the survivors were only the little girl and pregnant woman. Two characters you figure would have the hardest time surviving.
* the daughter singing Aloha Oe at the end ""Farwell to Thee"" knowing she'll never see her father again.
* the daughter. Great acting, let alone for someone her age.
* nice tension throughout the movie.
* the train as a settingThere were a few things that didn't quite work for me:
* the grandma opening the door. Why?
* the crazy guy. Why didn't we get more from him? What's his story?
* the somewhat hard to believe scene of the high school student letting his friend-girl kill him. I don't believe they were a couple, so hard to believe he'd feel that deep. Then again, I'm long out of high school and have never been on a zombie train. Maybe I would have acted the same way.
* the infection timing seemed to be a bit convenient, happening quickly some times, and slow enough at other times for plot/dramatic convenience.Nevertheless, just a great movie once they board the train. Loved it!"
" A story about what it means to be a father and a hero
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,8,"While on the surface, this film is a excellent zombie thriller, there is a rewarding underlying tale of personal redemption that's remarkably well integrated. One of the best films I've seen in a long while."
" Still some life in zombies
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,8,"This is a great zombie film for several reasons. Firstly pretty much all of it is filmed in broad daylight so you can see what is going on. Secondly it's pacey without going completely over the top in the action scenes. Thirdly there is characterisation and not just gore. You care about these people and want them to live. Fourthly it is quite well acted (the little girl is fantastically good and will break your heart) and very well directed. Yes it is a bit silly and overlong and is more of an action adventure film than a horror. The infected have not died so are not really zombies and there is none of that ""let's see how many ways we can destroy their brains"" which seems to be the only raison d'etre of most zombie movies. The effects are great without dominating the picture with the hordes of infected pouring out of glass windows and doors extremely well done.I will definitely seek out more Korean movies."
" Chillingly cool

" An absolutely amazing horror.

The story, the characters, the acting, the tension, the horror, the action, the zombies and the surprising emotional aspect to this film are all exectued to absolute perfection. The little girl in this film is amazing and your heart will go out to her throughout the entire movie. I would urge anyone who likes horror to watch this."
" Spy on human nature from disaster movies.
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,7,"There is no Hollywood-style heroism to save mankind, but more human reflection and emotional characterization. The overall rhythm of the movie is tight, some of the lyrical parts are very touching, and some are not deep enough."
" Had no idea zombie movies can make you cry too
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,9,Not a huge fan of zombie movies but this one is an entirely different story. It's not just a zombie movie it's an emotional roller coaster ride.
" Excellent

" I don't think it's just 7.5
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,9,"The biggest significance of the film is to firmly believe that in a collapsed and pre doomsday terrorist environment, people are human because they protect the weak, help the same kind of people, trust strangers, and even despair of the dark side of human beings. Behind the film, the audience will see the consideration of human nature of Korean directors, the operation of full internationalization, and the biting into the throat Black satire."
" A must watch Korean Thriller. There's no room for boredom,not even once.

" Good Zombie fun
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,7,"This is a good zombie fun action movie with the horror kept low and with most of the gore thankfully being off screen. Tension runs high however with every possible situation of a runaway train with zombies on board terrorizing the passengers before these in turn change into zombies exploited and milked dry
There are the usual tropes thrown in; the capitalist rich man who stops at nothing to save his life, the innocent and vulnerable child (who likes to stare a lot), the equally vulnerable pregnant wife (I never saw a pregnant woman run so fast in a movie), the dad who tries to save his child and the selfless hero among the top cast. Of these Dong-seok Ma who plays the altruistic hero is the most accomplished of all, acting wise"
" Zombies on a train.
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,7,"Zombie film. Surely there's too many of these. This one though I've heard is rather good. Not snakes on a plane, but zombies on a train. Bear with me... We're in Seoul, Seok-woo and his young daughter Soo-an are heading to see his ex-wife, who lives in Busan. Even as we leave Seoul, something isn't right. A sky-rise on fire, partial reports of a leak at a plant. We know zombies are imminent having seen a deer reanimate in the opening scene... looks really cool actually. The train pulls away, but not before one of these now human zombies that we've half spotted in the periphery gets on board. Seok-woo isn't the most attentive father and falls asleep as their journey begins, leaving his inquisitive daughter to roam the train, just as things are getting weird. Now let's get to the point... are the zombies any good? Well yes, yes they are! They're quick, coming to life in bone cracking yoga poses, all snarly, rapidly covered in convincing looking blood and the camera cuts are choppy at breakneck speeds. Add lots of flesh ripping and screaming and we're on the right track, so to speak. It quickly becomes clear that life outside the train is a bit buggered. Zombies everywhere, standard apocalypse. Thanks to YouTube clips viewed on phones and a government news broadcast on the trains TV, urging people to stay home to remain safe (that sounds familiar), the passengers realise the scale of the situation and panic accordingly. So we've a microcosm of society on board, half the train infected, half okay. Separated by a barricade of luggage, a door and the zombie stupidity at not attacking because they can't see their prey. If that were it I'd say this film was in trouble, but an ill-advised stop does manage to rid the train of a few zombies, provide respite for the now few survivors and add some meat to the back story bone. It's here too that the film takes on a disaster movie tone. There's a plan now. Back on the train, there are people trapped in random cars and toilets, including Soo-an now separated from her frankly quite useless father. It gets a bit more inventive and this is accompanied by some of the characters stories getting fleshed out a little more... but only a little. It does look cool, there's some great sequences and the characters although a bit one dimensional are good enough to carry it. There are clear favourites you want to root for and those you can't wait to be zombie fodder. I think though that I was expecting more and expectations are always dangerous. If you like zombie films, you will love this, but if you're after something a bit meatier, this I think comes up short. Su-an Kim, as the young Soo-an really is the stand out. Some of the other performances are good, but she brings her A-game and really is the glue that holds it together. A good zombie film is always worth a watch and this is, but it's only that, a good zombie film, nothing more... and that zombie deer in the opening scene really does look cool."
" Lived upto the expectations
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,9,"I had read a lot of rave reviews about the movie and believe it did good, even so better than I expected.
Looking at the budget I think this was perfectly made.
The movie had some minor errors which could be easily overlooked since the rest of it was so brilliant. The climax just just so outstanding- it was so emotional and intensifying."
" Edge of your seat horror!
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,7,"This movie is two hours long, and from the moment the zombies appear about 20 minutes into the movie, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Some of the scenes are almost unbearably tense. It is exciting but also sad because you grow to know and to like most of the characters in the movie and you don't want them to fall into the hands of the zombies.But by the end of the movie I felt not only sad but also burdened for some reason. I couldn't understand why because the movie itself was very well-made and enjoyable. And I wasn't bothered that the movie didn't end the way I wanted it to. No, it was something else.And I thought about it and I think it has something to do with the filmmakers way of looking at things, of their way of understanding the world. I know it's a fictional story of course, but what kind of a world is it where the reward for the incredible acts of bravery and of self sacrifice that some of the characters in the movie go through is to turn them into unthinking, ultra-violent bloodthirsty monsters!And then it occurred to me that it must have something to do with the filmmakers way of looking at things. It's a sad place indeed where your reward for incredible acts of bravery and of self-sacrifice is to become an ultra-violent unthinking monster. There is no redemption for these people, so they are running and fighting for nothing! Everyone here was hopelessly doomed from the very beginning.They say Jesus name in the movie but they use it merely as an exclamation as they often do in American movies. God cannot save anyone here because no one believes in him!"
" Brilliant!

Great zombie Flick. Intense and emotional. One of the best Korean films I have seen. The father/daughter storyline was great. Can't wait for the sequel!"

",2020-05-05 00:00:00,9,"This is one of my favourite movies i've seen and even though it is in Korean and i don't speak Korean everything else in the movie massively makes up for that, from the story, to the thrilling moments, plot revelations, action, realism(as much as a zombie movie can have). it has it all. The movie is also not afraid to get rid of main characters and unlike movies like WWZ no main character has ""Hollywood immunity "" to getting infected and that makes the movie a lot more tense and exiting.
Definitely worth a watch if you like apocalyptic or zombie movies and even if those aren't your favourite movie categories i would still recommend this movie."
" 7 for the movie but 0 for these disgusting reviews
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,"This is, overall, a pretty good movie. There are really good themes, the characters are interesting and you want to root for them, the effects and movements of the zombies are very well done, and it keeps your interest peaked. The pacing is done very well and the characters are all portrayed well in addition to being believable. However, I'm repulsed by all of these reviews talking about the female teenager of the movie, debating about her outfit, calling her sexy, etc. when she's supposed to be a teenager trying to survive in a zombie apocalypse. Please control yourselves and stop clogging up the review section with talk about a character who is supposed to be a minor. Thanks."
" AWESOME Horror Moviey
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,10,"This film does the zombie subgenre right! The acting, directing, cinematography, pacing...all of it was nearly perfect. Everyone I've introduced this movie to ended up loving it. This isn't a slow-burner, where you end up waiting until the second half to get action. Within the first 30 minutes, you're on the edge of your seat. I've rewatched this movie about 3-4 times and never seem to get tired of it.
If you're a fan of horror movies, do not pass this one up."
" Awesome
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,8,"Another awesome genre movie from Korea, unfortunately fails to become another masterpiece. The first half of the movie is really great, like every moment on that train is horryfing and exciting at the same time but then when they leave the train it becomes generic blockbuster with bad CGI effects. Still a lot to love about this movie, especiall the ending shot which is heartbreaking. I am excited for sequel!"
" Not a zombie flick
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,8,"The ""zombies"" in this movie are not zombies. None of them came back from the dead. They didn't eat people. And they move fast. These things are the same as the afflicted people in World War Z, in movement and the sheer number of them. They are the result of some kind of infection or virus.That being said, this was a really good movie. The characters were believable and great. You love the good guys and really hate the bad guy. I was fortunate enough to catch the version dubbed in English so it was very easy to watch. Lots of action and blood. The fact that they were stuck on the train created claustrophobic terror. The end is heart-wrenching."

" Another Great Zombie Movie.
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,8,A very exciting movie but the problem is the people are as dumb as they are in every horror movie.

How they film the movie is amazing!"
" The Best Zombie movie that I've ever seen!
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,10,Take notes dear Hollywood. This is how a real thriller should be made. TTB captures your heart from the beginning and keep you there till the end. Great cinematography and amazing performance by the cast.
" So stupid, seemed like a comedy
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,1,Literally every scene is so stupid that I regret waching this movie.
" Dropped. Can't watch it until the end
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,3,"I hate to say this because I have positive expectation towards this movie since several of my friends recommended it and told me this was good. Yet, here I am writing a bad review about this. One of the reason why I want to drop this without even finishing it, is because there are so many inconsistencies throughout the movie not to mention all the characters in it did unbelievable, unrealistic stupid act during what we called as emergency situations in which your very own life is on the line. Ex. of this stupidity:1. The first infected person who was sneaking into the train still got consciousness and only turn into zombie after some time but this rule doesn't apply to the rest of the movie because immediately after that the infection spread at amazing speed. It only needs seconds fort the bitten to turn into zombie.Then right before the end of the movie (I read all the bad review before hand and decided to jump several times to see whether it is worth it or not to spend my 2 hrs for this movie), the infected person once again slowly turn into zombie (esp.when the main character involved, suddenly the infected person still had a little of consciousness for a while until completely turn into the mindless one)
2. Way of fighting. I already watched several types of zombie movies (Dawn of the dead, World War Z, Warm Bodies, Zombieland,28 Days Later, RE, I am Legend > which is my favourite so far)and the way MC fight back (or the rest of the victim ways of responding the outbreak) kinds of silly, lame, uncool, and can't bring the tension.Without regret, I dropped this one. Not even ""the supposed to be heart warming scene"" where the little girl had to depart from the MC can change my mind to continue it. FYI, I'm a big fans of Korean Drama, Korean movies, and actually watch Gong Yoo drama series, but his act in this movie just so-so especially in the last scene of him (I cringe a lot, C'mon!There are so many better ways to fight the last zombie villain yet you choose to do something that will obviously be your death flag. Seriously. The story writer got mess up in the head and didn't working on the story properly), and I can't bear to watch this anymore.Save yourself by skipping this one. Feel free to try if you are rather a curious mind like I did (I give it a shot despite many bad review since I believe sometimes review can be pretty much subjective) but beware you have been warned."
" Film about moral
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,8,There is a good action film; Actors act naturally.It leads us to explore the moral from an individual and collective perspective.
" Now this is a zombie film!
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,8,Really fresh take on the tired zombie genre - it's an emotional thrill-ride that doesn't let up.
" An emotional zombie train ride
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,9,"A zombie thriller with a truly emotional ride. The best aspect of the film was for me how a father's lack of love for his daughter came full circle to show a parent's selfless love for his child. And the ending, goodness me, the plot use of the little girl's recital song was remarkable. This is a great ride of emotions, the zombies were secondary really."
" Zoombastic
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,9,"A very well made movie that keeps you hooked for nearly 2 hours.
Better than all the zoombie themed movies that I have seen till date."
" Amazing
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Oh what a beautiful movie it is! At first I thought it may be a as usual movie like other Zombie movies,but the director prooved anything can be made from anything! Very heart touching ❤,full of suspens, emotion and thrills.... and the end scenes.... just amazing!"
" Mostly very good
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,7,"Yeah so if you watch this movie, I think it's hard to deny how good it is. The action, production, acting combined with both horrifying elements and heartwarming and heartbreaking character moments throughout, it's quite the ride (pun intended).
I really thought I was gonna like this movie a whole lot more up until the ending. Spoilers*! of course.
There were a few pacing issues going back and forth between this big character moment and this big character moment and this big character moment, which honestly made me feel like watching a few insanely good episodes of The Walking Dead back-to-back (not to really compare the two in any other way as they are entirely different). So when it came to the ending, it didn't quite stick the landing for me. At that point, I was very emotionally invested with the characters and it felt kind of like cheating how they killed off the main hero like that and give him his moment and it just...The acting was insane (deserves way more credit than it even gets, especially the little girl), but I honestly had trouble feeling it as much. You just keep seeing this thing throughout the movie and the pay-off for the death is so minimal and such a cowardly low character to bring this faith to the story. (And I do appreciate what they were trying to say but I think the point came across more than once both about status and simply about being humane.) It honestly only upset me that it was what happened, and when we see a very iconic shot of the two remaining survivors at the end walking together, I couldn't help but feel like they definitely earned that moment but so did the dad, and I just didn't feel it as much cus my emotions had just gotten zoomed out. It's like hey, the team behind this movie wanted to do everything to make you cry and even put in shots of the girl as a baby, which could be fine, but it just wasn't quite earned and it pretty much messes up the satisfaction of that ending. Not that we need happy endings or even a bittersweet one but dang... Earn it, don't draw it out and suddenly kill off the hero like 15 other people with these moments because suddenly he can't throw this dumb person off a train in eight attempts despite what we just been seeing for 2 hours, resulting in a cut scene from Grey's Anatomy mixing newborns with melodramatic death scenes.
Unfortunately, that just leaves me having not gained quite the impact I expected from the first and second act and not even half as satisfied as I were with them, bringing me to that I'll still call this a mostly very good movie... overall.(I certainly hope there is not going to be an American remake of this ever, that'd be too bad. But with its great universal sale, upcoming sequel and high quality production matching some of the best we get from Hollywood, I hope and suspect that it won't be the case. This stands perfectly in its own roots.)"
" train to busan
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,8,Korean commercial movies are so successful that even zombies run fast
" Exciting
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,7,"Exciting movie! Was a bit sceptical in the beginning with the zombie thing but I saw it - and I liked it! Full of action and emotions and you are going to empathise with some of the characters. I had the thought of it being really predictable but it caught me by surprise, actually only predictable few times and that made it enjoyable."
" Exciting and deep zombie movie
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,10,"I see a lot of the other posters commenting on the appearance of the female actresses which I find unusual, however every actor played their role fantastically and embodied them very well. Furthermore, this movie provides a very good social commentary and portrays class differences quite well, exactly to the smallest detail. Also the inter-human relations between people are really well portrayed and quite realistic.In addition this movie is great due to it being realistic, it does not sugarcoat the ""realities"" of a zombie outbreak, what can, will go bad at the next turn, and only those fortunate or resourceful make it out alive, as would be in real life.TL;DR this is a movie filled with constant action which keeps you on the edge, fantastic acting, a great social commentary, and astounding inter-human relations."
" Unrealistic Human Behavior/ All Around Stupid
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,3,"I wasn't feeling this movie and made it about 30 mins in before I had to stop, but not for the same reasons as a lot of other negative reviewers, which seem to take issue w/ the zombies' abilities themselves, that's not the issue. The behavior of the characters is so odd and unbelievable I couldn't suspend my disbelief. I'll give you some examples.1) The young daughter of the main character walks into a small train cabin to use the bathroom while train employees are dealing w/ a clearly deranged and potentially dangerous man in that very bathroom. Instead of telling her to leave they just let her stand...LITERALLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM, while this man mumbles about how everyone's going to die. First red flag.2) When the zombies start attacking most people seem to just stand around like idiots waiting for their death. It was actually kinda funny to see...3) The main character gets a call from his mother and instead of immediately asking how she is and telling her to barricade the door, he just has a chat w/ her until he realizes she's already been bitten. So dumb.4) Everyone is all around way too calm w/ their current situation.Skip that one, unless you're like most people and have absolutely no standards lawl."
" Sang-hwa is the most beautiful specimen ever created
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,7,"This movie would not be what it is without sang-hwa, whatta gem, I love him"
" You have to board the train!
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,8,"This is a story of a man from being a dirty capitalist and bad father to a better human and good father. The things we do for our children, working late, earning more and more money, better schools, but are they worth the time you ought to spend time with your children and family. The different type of people we face in an untoward situation and how to deal with it, humanely or not? The sacrifices, love, strength, wickedness, loss and heroism. All in one."
" Action packed from beginning to end!
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,8,"Although zombies typically had been slow in the past with them being the ""buried dead"", etc., you have to admit that zombies have evolved in movies so much since the '80s. What movie would be this intense with zombies that you could easily outwalk?! With that being said, these were pretty frightening and that's saying a lot considering there wasn't much gore to go along with it. The special effects weren't too over the top and there were plenty of pretty realistic bits to everything. In comparison I would say these zombies are similar to ones in World War Z or 28 Weeks Later.The difference between this movie and those other 2 is that this storyline is much better. There wasn't some special person on a special mission or anything extravagant. It was a normal dad and his daughter as well as other seemingly normal people going on a normal train ride that ends up being far from normal. Although no character was super special, it was still action packed and as realistic as you can get with zombie movies. To me that's what made it so amazing. Bonus points for actually killing off a main character since that usually never happens!There is also something to be said about the little girl. She was phenomenal for being so young and added so much to the movie. I didn't expect a movie like this to be so emotional, but she sure made it that way with several scenes. More notably when her dad got bit. That was a tough scene to watch because her emotions felt so real.All the other actors were great as well! I don't believe there was a single one that really sucked. Although there isn't much background with every secondary character, you still gather enough information about who they are as people as things progress. This helped with the very intense scenes where one would die off.I don't watch many Korean movies, or many other foreign films for that matter, but this has me wanting to watch more. The only difficult part was having to read subtitles and possibly missed some stuff by doing so, but there was so much other good to this movie that I didn't care in the end. Even for it being a pretty lengthy movie, which is usually a huge turnoff for me. Surprisingly I kept up from start to finish!An issue I noticed that was different than others was that there didn't seem to be a certain timeframe that one would turn rabid once they got bit. It seemed to vary depending on who got bit and where we were in the movie. It could be more intense that way considering you don't know when it will happen. Or it could be a bit of a plot whole. Just depends on how you look at it. There was also a little inconsistency with breaking glass being that sometimes they could break through and other times they couldn't although the glass is all the same.Another weird/confusing bit was when they went through tunnels and the zombies all of a sudden couldn't see. When that happened the zombies literally went mute pretty much and stopped attacking. But they could hear things still. The only problem I had with that is they made a point to say that they got angry when they saw the characters still alive. So do they get angry off seeing them? Or is it the noises the people make?? It seemed to be a little weird to have that part in there and didn't make much sense to me watching it play out.Besides those few negatives, this movie still had so much else to offer. I would still recommend to anyone that's into zombie-type moves. Really glad I stumbled upon it!"
" The best zombie movie I've ever seen!
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,9,"All I can say is if you like zombie movies, this is a must see! The storyline, characters,setting all great!"
" Zombies on a Train
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,7,"The action of ""Train to Busan"" is so intense and the set-up excellent that the movie's faults may almost be overlooked. Others have, rightly, compared the fighting aboard a train, moving through carnage from car to car, to ""Snowpiercer"" (2013), also by Korean filmmakers and also including a heavy-handed message on socio-economic inequality. The cinematic potential of trains, which partly came of age along with motion pictures at the end of the 19th century, was realized early on, though: as coinciding movement with the Lumière brothers' ""Arrival of a Train"" (1896), as framing movement with the phantom-ride views that displayed shifting scenery from the point of view of a moving train, and, with action as a third layer of momentum, as early as Edwin S. Porter's ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903). So, here, in ""Train to Busan,"" we have zombies instead of bandits. Zombies running down aisles after their fleshy prey, zombies seen outside shifting views from the windows, and zombies thrown into windows. Even the effects for their piling up when a large enough herd is in pursuit works well enough.The father-child dynamic is effective, too. But, the prospect of the fund manager investing in a company maybe responsible for the outbreak adds nothing. And, as if it weren't enough for this ""bloodsucker,"" as another, lower-class character (played by Ma Dong-seok, the most charismatic actor of the bunch) calls him--such terminology putting him in league with the flesh-eating zombies, to learn his lesson, to treat people with respect and egalitarianism, an insufferably irredeemable baddie is introduced. This leads to a contrived class structure between the train doors that's ridiculously oblivious to the undead threat surrounding them. Plus, there are other melodramatic contrivances and repetitions in the characters' quest for survival. As a zombie action flick, however, ""Train to Busan"" is, indeed, a thrill ride, and the ending nicely threatens a reference to that first modern zombie film, ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968)."
" Good
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,9,"After watching ""train to busan"", I believe that you can be impressed, remember, is the hero of the role played by kong liu and ma dongxi as a handsome uncle. These two personified human justice. What do they show in the movie as the true heroes of doom"
" Amazing Zombie Film
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,8,I think concept of Zombies is stupid and shallow. But i understand that it has an entertainment value. This is a great film about a pandemic. With just enough of Korean drama to keep you Captivated throughout the film. According to me it is a must watch for any film goer. I came across this film through Woo-sik Choi's Filmography and I am not disappointed.
" a total waste of time.
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,3,I have no way of making up for the time of my life that I have wasted watching this movie; nothing more to say; a total waste of time.
" Good for a Watch
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,5,"I didn't know it was a zombie movie before watching it, but I guess I'm not disappointed in what it turned out to be. There were some obnoxious moments where the plot basically announced what it was about to do and the finale was extremely reminiscent of a certain Zombie game... All in all most of the acting wasn't great but really, direction was fantastic, was a very cool-looking movie, didn't do anything amazing but was better than most. Probably won't be watching it again any time soon."
" Not a single boring moment

" Epic.
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,10,"I liked it!
I've watched it about 4 times now, once with no subtitles. Apart from the obvious cliche in all horror movies - that being how some people are stupid and stare at the drama happening in front of them rather than running - there are no complaints. I liked the acting and I believe the movie was done well, the acting wasn't terrible either. I like how it's similar to World War Z except Train to Busan is based solely in South Korea. Well done."
" Low budget zombie movie with feelings
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,6,It's an alright movie. Good for what it is. Too many feelings for my taste.
" Good and evil
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,9,"The wave of people represented by bad uncle is selfish, dark, and ugly? So what do the groups of people from the upper, middle and lower classes represent when the old, weak, sick, pregnant, and even the homeless suddenly come here? Representing the positive energy of all strata in the disaster from the dispersal of the people to the concerted effort? What about the ""bad guys""? What class it represents, from the character setting, seems to be unable to explain why, I do n't understand why the director should put together several types of people, and then sacrifice one by one. The male leader of the highest class is the originator of this city-wide zombie virus outbreak. Why can he rescue a group of ""good and just"" people, at the end sacrifices himself to jump off the train, and then give a heroic feeling? Punch you and give you a piece of candy to cure you, you are a good person"
" I had really been tiring of the Zombie flick..but....
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,10,"This movie was fantastic for a few reasons... It is faced paced once the action kicks up.. Time isn't wasted on tons of irrelevant character history, it is about the ""in the moment"" character empathy.. Were this movie got me was it's heart. Most hollywood cookie cutter action flicks have some kid with unreal ""talents"" at it's core... This movie has a child.. just a normal child, but what a great lil' actress she is. The whole movie was a great ride!"
" Snake on plane, now it Z on Trains

" So much untold plot
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,6,Many people wrote as a one of the best horror movie and heart touching movie etc etc. But from my point of view it lacks plot holes in many ways. Many things are not very clear. Like why suddenly people become zombie? And only two people from a whole train survive and manage to go busan? How they managed rest of the country? World War z was far better story line than this one. But i like acting all of the characters. It was intense. And during this kind of situation you can able to see the evil side of humans.

" Just another dumb Zombie film
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,4,"Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.The film's plot is just dumb. The film is made up of every cliched zombie plot point. All gobbled up in one single movie. It's just what I say lazy writing. No character development (urggh I know this is a zombie movie but still) Somehow few small events are supposed to define the characters present in the movie. But that's not how things work. If you are selfishly saving your ass and then suddenly if a girl lectures you to ""always think about others"", you can't become the Hero of the Humanity in a second. You can't write full character arcs in a film which is just showing events of few hours. (I mean you can but you need to be a very great writer to pull that off, in this case it wasn't). And just because of this lack of character development, I wasn't entirely rooting for anyone to get saved (to be honest there were times when I was wishing no one survives in the train).And what is this obsession of killing each and every character in overtly melodramatic way? I get it people are dying. But if that is happening so frequently as in this movie then I can't cry for every character's death.The only thing which was impressing were the zombies. No back story. Lethal. Ready in no time (But yet there were some convenient exceptions). And dumb. Just like the entire film."
" This might be the greatest Zombie movie ever made
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,10,"I ""LOVE"" Zombie Movies. Some are just crap and hard to get into for sure. World War Z was good, Dawn of the Dead 2004 was good, 28 days/weeks later, the Resident Evils and theres been quite a few pretty good. The Comedic Zombie Land is great too. But this one was original and the acting and the way the zombies move was simply brilliant! Not to mention that I have ""never"" had a Zombie movie in my life bring a tear or two to my eyes. I am kind in disbelief this one did but it did. Such a great movie and anyone that likes Zombie movies, or just suspense scary stuff, you absolutely need to see this one! It really is that great!
11/10 Stars IMHO for Zombie movies."
" Exhilarating Day One zombie movie
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,"Train to Busan is a story about a group of random people that are on their way to Busan in South Korea when the zombie virus breaks loose and people start to turn. The movie is nothing more than their desperate struggle to survive through the initial onslaught and make it to safety. But it excels at just that, being nail-bitingly intense, legitimately scary and surprisingly touching on character level.First of all, the zombies are great. Full of props to the actors and the special effects team for their work, because not only were these zombies scary on a conceptual level - turning in an instant and being blindingly fast and strong - but they were also played superbly and looked horrifying.Secondly, the script is great. Day One zombie movies are often rather similar in their plots, and as such there's an art to doing it in a way that feels new and novel. And this movie certainly does that. I also really liked the characters and their interactions. Rarely have I cared as much about the survivors in a zombie film as I've cared about these people. Our nominal main characters, the father and daughter, and their character arcs were especially heart-wrenching.Lastly, the directing. Yeon Sang-ho has a superb grasp on when to rush the plot along and when to give us a moment to breathe. It's an intense movie where there's always danger and something happening, but we still have these moments to get to know our characters and come to care about them. Or hate them, depending. The worst threats in a zombie apocalypse are often the other survivors, after all.Fantastic film. One of the best zombie films I've seen in years. One of the best horror films in general, as well, for that matter. Recommended."
" First Class Ride on the Zombie Express!
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,9,"Not since George A Romero's ground-breaking Night of the Living Dead have I been quite so excited by a zombie film, as I have by Korean director Yeon Sang-ho's outstanding Train to Busan written by Park Joo-suk. Just as Romero's iconic black and white feature almost single-handedly dragged horror stories away from the antiquated gothic conventions of yesteryear, Train to Busan is most definitely a zombie film for a 21st century global world, familiar with the challenges associated with all manner of international travails.The film mostly takes place on a bullet train travelling from Seoul to Busan as a zombie apocalypse suddenly breaks out in the country and threatens the safety of all the confined passengers. These include Seok-woo a cynical workaholic fund manager and divorced father of his daughter Su-an, who wants to spend her birthday with her mother in Busan. Other passengers include Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, Yon-suk a calculating, manipulative chief executive, a high school baseball team including Yong-guk and his cheerleader girlfriend Jin-hee, elderly sisters In-gil and Jong-gil, and a traumatized homeless stowaway hiding in the bathroom. As the train departs, an ill young woman runs onto the train unnoticed. She turns into a zombie and attacks a train attendant, who also turns. The infection spreads rapidly throughout the confined spaces of the train.The beauty of this film is that it doesn't just concentrate on the provision of standard visceral generic thrills. It serves as a vehicle to highlight civil unrest resulting in mass hysteria and general panic and indecisiveness; the root of confusing mixed messaging and communications from governing authorities. It can also be seen as a scrutinising microscope, forensically examining the breakdown of nuclear families, socio-economic class distinctions and seeking answers to ethical and moral questions such as which is of greater importance, survival of the individual or the collective?Fine performances abound from the large cast with particular attention being directed towards Ma Dong-seok as Sang-hwa, a tough, working-class man, who is first to demonstrate to other passengers that it is possible to fight back against insurmountable odds, whilst showing care towards other individuals. Ostensible lead actor Gong Yoo is also very convincing as a self-centred work obsessive, who slowly realises his personal responsibilities to others, as well as his own latent skills and talents that may help him and others survive the onslaughts they must face.The film created on a budget of just US$8.5 million is a technical marvel, filled with a number of amazing shots, which I for one couldn't help wondering how they had actually been staged and to what extent, if any, was CGI involved. The suspense and thrill factor is only enhanced by a number of twists and turns and breath-taking set pieces which never appear contrived or staged, rather logical outcomes from previous actions.I can only encourage you to grab a ticket and climb aboard the Train to Busan; not just a clever, fresh take on the zombie genre, but also an extremely well-made film with fully realised characters and plenty of social commentary to underscore the bursts of skilfully staged action."

",2020-04-01 00:00:00,9,This movie is very interesting and exciting. The partners watching with me were scared. I hope the movie will never become a reality
" It's not ""The Godfather"", but as far as zombie movies go, it's among the best.
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,9,"And that's all I'm going to say. I wish some of the actors had been a bit better, but... If you like zombie movies, you'll like this one. If you don't like zombie movies, you should better avoid it."
" Good horror action n thriller good for family
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"V good movie for family gathering
Not a single vulgur scene present."
" ONE OF THE BEST ZOMBIE MOVIES EVER
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"Honestly, I love Korean movies, and am obsessed with Zombie movies. Parasite showed the broader world how Koreans cab make a great movie, but honestly, I think this is better.Without a doubt, in the top 3 zombie apocalypse movies ever.Enjoy the ride!!"
" Looking forward to the sequel
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"In this movie, it shows the kindness and evil of human nature, some of them are willing to sacrifice themselves for family love and others are willing to harm others in order to survive. The most moving is the last scene. The voice of the little girl singing rings in the railway tunnel. The soldiers in the distance put down their guns and they were saved... I'm looking forward to the second one. The director regrets that he wrote Ggong dead, or there will be Ggong in the second one!"
" WOW! Blown Away!
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"What can I say? 28 Days Later is my top zombie flick of all time and this is the only other Zombie flick to rival it. I am utterly impressed and the humanistic touch and emotional connection I had with these characters was an amazing feat created by the writer and director. This is the third Korean film that I've watched after watching ""The Chaser"", which turned me on to Korean Cinema and ""The Flu"" which was excellent. This is a fast paced, high octane, thriller with an unforgettable ending. After watching so many trash films that have open endings, I can appreciate that Korean Films don't engage this style. I'm becoming more impressed with their films than ours. This is coming from an American viewer. Korean Cinema has a new fan! 👍🏾"
" Decent movie, slot plot, poor setting, sad, unfulfilling ending
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,4,"This movie gets a lot of hype, likely for the way people overly-fetishize anything east-asian at times. This was South Korea's first dig at a zombie focused film and they did fairly well for their efforts. The makeup and effects were mediocre, and the plot too, but overall it had a good basis and is worth a run-through. That said, I'm not going to sugar coat it, I've seen better zombie flicks, and I've seen far worse. This could've passed for an 80's flick, no doubt. There was a lot of cheese, a lot of poor effects effort, hell some of the zombies looked like their regular human counterpart that was shown a few seconds ago. No effort at all to try and transition them over to an undead state aesthetically. There were parts where I paused it to go do something else, out of boredom, just to come back to it and power through. Do I think this deserves the rating it has? Nah. It's good, but let's not go overboard here."
" Sweet and spicy.
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,10,"I don't like giving 10 stars, it implies I am lazy or overzealous but I honestly can't think of anything to knock a star off for.
I dunno if that is how the Koreans do stuff (I've only seen one other Korean horror film that I know of, The Host) but this was a sweet and spicy movie. The spicy part was all over the place in the form of slavering hordes of really stressed out zombies who probably need to chill. There was plenty of action and distinct rounded characters in some big scenes.
The sweet was the truly tragic note to the finale which, like in The Host really grabbed you in the feels. Kim Soo An is a great actor and I hope they didn't do something nasty to make her cry like that."
" Not what I expected from a zombie movie
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"I've seen this movie being mentioned here and there on social media and many called it ""the best zombie movie of all time"", so going into this movie I expected some cool action scenes with some original takes on zombie apocalypses. This movie has all that and more. What wasn't mentioned about this movie was how dramatic and emotional it was while also displaying social criticism. But those aren't the movie's best qualities. The movie's best quality are the characters and how and why they act. They act logically and think creatively to solve their problems while also being pressured by their emotions and/or the herd mentality to maybe act differently. Sure, there are some clichés and some exaggerated action scenes but overall it's a great movie that everyone should watch. 8/10."
" This movie was one of the best.
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,9,"For a foreign film, after the intro of the characters, the action begins and not too long into the movie. It was well worth the time to watch it. Excellent story (even though you know how it were to end), good acting, and the story flow was perfect. A great film indeed!!!"
" Best Zombie movie ever made
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,10,"Fast paced.. as fast as the Train to Busan..great ensemble of characters. The little girl was phenomenal.
Best south Korean movie I've ever seen. And best Zombie movie of all. And I've seen them all. Characters that you root for...cry when they don't make it.. characters that you hope get bit.
I didn't mind the subtitles...youdidnt even need to read them if you chose not to..won't take anything away from the visual of the film. Claustrophobic at times. Full of tense moments. Tear jerker to be certain.
Love. love this film."
" Explosion of emotions
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,9,"Train to Busan ('Busanhaeng'), in my opinion the best zombie apocalypse film of the era. This isn't just about surviving a zombie outbreak. It's more about caring and looking out for each other when the world comes to an end."
" Last train to mediocrity
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,1,"I don't understand the reviews here. Do people came to watch teenage girls in skirts? Why are the ratings so high!? Definitely in my top 3 worst ""horror movies"". I cannot believe how stupid actors are. It's all full of unbelivibly stupid decisions. So many inconsistencies. And bad acting. Even the make up are bad. Please, if you like coherence and real horror movies, do not waste your time on this."
" Crisis & Response of People
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,7,"This movie seems not to be so horror or thrilling. But the moral I get from the movie is really very important. It shows crystal clearly how people reacts on crisis. Maximum people think for their own servible. But, of them some heoric people fight until their last breath.
That's the point :-)"
" Best Zombie movie i've ever watched
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,10,"This is such a great and truly underrated movie. Cinematography and acting is great, the effects were pretty good for something that isn't from Hollywood and huge budgets. And the best part is, there is no Hollywood crap like two charachters kissing in the middle of the escape scene. I really enjoyed this movie and it was way better than what i expected."
" Too bad to watch. Don't waste your time
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,1,I just made an account in here to say to the others that this movie is the worst movie I've ever watched. The recorded rate is totally misleading.
" Terrible movie
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,1,Worst experience in horror movies. Just terrible. Not recommended at all.
" best zombie movie
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,10,It is better than all the american zombie movies it shows america that how to make a zombie movie
" South Korea tries on zombies
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,8,"During the beginning of the zombie outbreak, a father tries to get his daughter out of the town that is the epicenter, via train.Most of this movie takes place on the train, or a train I guess without giving away too much. The acting is decent, the special effects are meh. To be fair on that part, these were all newly infected people, so there was no decay to show.What I found interesting about this, as it comes from a culture where honor and class are so essential to the daily lives of the Koreans, that it lent another layer of story to the movie. One man, a powerful business man held sway over the passengers, much to their detriment.All in all a decent zombie movie, though no where near as good as some on here seem to think it is."
" The Best Zombie Movie To Date
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie did what I have not seen many, if any, American or British-made zombie movies even try, and that's tell a believable, frightening, and tear-jerking story that will keep you interested all the way to the end. The only other zombie movie I enjoyed as much as this one is of a completely different genre, and that's Shaun of the Dead (a British comedy).This movie had characters you loved and hated. This movie had a situation that was believable under those circumstances. This movie had actually scary zombies and situations that did not rely on cheap jumpscares to frighten viewers. This movie also had emotion, enough to make a grown man need a box of tissues by the end, and no I'm not talking about for the hot cheerleader girl.Absolutely take a chance on this movie! The whole movie is Korean audio and English dub, which normally I don't enjoy, because I don't like to read my movies, but you will quickly forget you're reading subtitles after a short while because the story keeps you hooked."
" Overcoming the language barrier has introduced me to a whole new world of great films
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,8,It started with Parasite. Now this movie. I am in love with South Korean movies. This is probably the best zombie movie I have watched.
" Very Good
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,10,This movie is so raw is very good made me and my sister yell and cry at the very end it was very emotional and worth it I cried so hard I couldn't see where I was going 10/10
" Intense, Well Made Zombie Movie
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,9,"This is hands down one of the most intense Zombie movies I have seen to date, there is not a dull moment in this train ride of a movie, and it would make a exellent video game.The characters we meet are all great and underneath the Zombie mayhem lie a struggle within humans whether to help others or be selfish when corpses hit the fan.I would recommend this hands down and it is available on Netflix right now."
" Good story, a little boring
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,6,"I like the story and the cast, yet the middle part seems a little boring and tedious, just keep running and fighting for most part of the movie."
" Missed this gem of a zombie movie
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,9,Loved this. On the edge of my seat and bawling at the end.
" writing sucks
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,5,"The movie is beautifully made. Amazing makeup, acting on a very good level (even by the extras) the scrips itself at the beginning feels amazing, stressful and well thought. The last part of the movie ( i mean around last 40 minutes) is unbearable! The movie feels artificially stretched. The meaningless deaths of main characters. It seems like writers had an amazing idea and executed it brilliantly until they got tired of writing so just wrote the rest to get rid of it"
" ( South korean A+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,9,A zombie film that is very surprisingly good. The train set up is a great set piece and makes you feel slightly claustrophobic which helps add to the tension. Some real interesting characters that you want to have a connection towards. If you don't mind reading subtitles and like zombie films then give this one a shot. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
" Best zombie film I've ever seen
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,8,"I've always been a sucker for a good zombie film. This one is superb. The storyline is fresh, the acting was great all around and the cinematography was to die for. I loved every minute of this movie."
" Great Action Film
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,9,Most western zombie films are pretentious and take themselves too seriously. This is just a good old action movie that'll keep you riveted once you get past the rather slow opening.
" Great zombie movie
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,10,"Probably the best zombie film I've ever watched, the train enviroment is claustrophobic and there are many intense parts and also emotional ones. Didn't thought I would enjoy this one so much, awsome surprise."
" Best zombie film out there
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,9,"I just came around to watch this film, I don't get why it isn't rated higher. It has it all, the greedy, the selfless, the one who changes, I consider it to be the most original zombie movie out there, by far, and a tearjerker even. Excellent production, writing and cast. Another great movie crossed out from the list!"
" Want a happy ending? This aint it chief
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,8,"Or maybe it is depending on how optimistic you are...
I enjoy films like this-- where the bad guy is winning over and over again. I hate predictable storylines and I am glad to say this film had me on edge.
Also, can I also mention how amazing the tiny actress is? She is going places for sure! I cannot wait to follow the main actors and actress and see what other films they have starred in.
The CGI, although not a major detriment, took away my attention slightly and broke the wall between story and film but AGAIN not a complaint, just a mention.8/10!"
" Legitimately great
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,8,"I kind of thought I was done with the Zombie flick but upon hearing the buzz for this one I decided to finally give it a go. It was a good decision. First thing I liked is how quick everything took off, the zombies turned quick and they were fast as hell. They also had a great cast. The big dude was my favorite and I got quite a bit of satisfaction when he ran over and elbowed a zombie to the ground in the train station to save the little girl. The main guy evolved as well and quit his selfish ways for his daughter. The end was a serious tear jerker for me which is something I hadn't expected in a zombie movie. Might be because I'm a dad now but it hit me."
" Dont listen Nonsense Haters,This movie For Class Audiance
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,10,"South korea Far ahead then Hollywood to produce outclass Zombie movie i still regret to not watch this in cinema,Direction,Story,Acting,Music,Visual effect all was just too good, Korean are masters to divert emotiones & Devolped stories in Depth
Ending movie will can easily break evry one heart,normally i not liked Zombie movies at all ,watched Hollywood famous Movie World war Z, 28 weaks later, Shaun of the Dead ,Dawan of the dead & many more but not liked it this first Zombie movie just loved it"
" What a greater movie!

" More than your typical zombie film
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,10,"Best zombie film I've seen in a long time. Deep and beautiful, the story invites you to think about what truly matters in our lives: people. Elegantly crafted, great suspense, many twists and turns to keep you on your toes. Much more than your typical blood and gore zombie film."
" The user reviewers must be zombies
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,1,"This is the worst zombie movie i have ever seen.
The only thing this film had working for it was a good idea (zombies on a high speed train). The content of the film, terrible. Predictable, morally corny, poor acting (except for the little girl). I would rather eat cat-food for the rest of my life, than have watched this piece of zombie-garbage."
" NonStop action!!
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,9,"I've watched many many zombie movies but never one like this. It was so intense. Non stop. My heart was racing through most of it. Definitely had an emotional appeal too, not all action.That little girl is going to be a star. She can act. The rest of the cast was amazing too.Just overall great directing. The fast parts mixed with the slow parts so well.Ending was great. It didn't have the closure like I want in most movies but it was great.The overwhelming positive reviews are on point. Don't be turned off by the subtitles because it was very action oriented and not spoken oriented."
" Loved this movie
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,8,"I have seen many zombie movies and thought it was a tired format for a movies, but this movie has lots of high tension, edge of your seat moments that keep you hooked from start to the Finish. The characters are really good believable and you want them to live."
" Train to Busan
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,8,"This movie was really intense. I was literally holding my breath as the zombies attacked and through all the sneaky plans to get by. One of the best apocalyptic dramas, very emotional and fast-paced. There's a clear evolution of character which I was happy to witness, from selfish to selfless and that makes you think about priorities in your life. Really recommend you go see it!"
" Comment.
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,9,"I just want to say the words of praise for the screenplay, from the beginning to the end, constant struggle and uncertainty."
" Best Zombie survival in my opinion
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,10,"The cinematography of this movie. The plot, its screenplay all our amazing. Its dark, its thrill.
In my opinion, this is the best Zombie survival Post-Apocalyptic movie. It has unexpected turns in it. The action is good, i definitely prefer it"
" Not just a Movie, It's a lesson
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,8,"This movie is all about selfish and selfless people. Story is new And if you like to watch less drama then this is that type of movie. I dont had too much expectations and i dont disappoint either. I'm sure you'll also enjoy this movie.
Have a Good Time Guys"
" Train to Busan an showed America how to make a zombie movie.
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,10,"So, a typical Zombie movie from America has:
A badass character that does everything to save the world and side characters that help him do this things.
But Train to Busan is different. How?
Well in this movie the main character is just a normal character with a daughter trying to survive.And that's it. No main badass character, nothing.This movie shows how a real zombie outbreak could happen, how individuals could attack other individuals because of their selfishness.I could go on and on about why this movie is so great."
" First Korean Movie!

I never thought Korean movies would be THIS amazing. This movie was truly well made. You never got bored watching this, from beginning to end. You feel all kinds of emotions watching this. Everything from happiness to sadness. The ending though. I wish I could write something about the ending without spoiling it for those that are reading this. But what a ending. A ending I did not expect. What a beautiful movie though. A movie that had drama, love, horror, thrill, comedy and everything else in it. A mix of everything.

" Not Your Average Gore-Fest Zombie Flick
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,8,"""Train to Busan"" is a 2016 Korean drama/zombie film directed by Yeon Sang-ho. It follows a man named Gong Yoo, his estranged daughter Soo-Ann and other passengers become trapped on a speeding train during a zombie outbreak in South Korea.I was recommended to watch this film by a close friend of mine, he knows I love horror/drama films and the fact that it's a Korean based film is even more up my alley. Then I found out this was on Netflix, so I finally got to watch it! I can honestly say this is the strongest zombie film I've ever seen, I know that's a huge statement to make since some U.S. based zombie films are well regarded. However I have my reasons, which I will get into.First of all whatever cameras they used to film this movie I would kill to play around with! This movie was beautiful and so crystal clear in picture. There are fantastic shots done in this film and I really appreciate it for that. Also the special effects themselves were top of the line, that deer at the beginning looked fantastic. Seeing hoards of zombies running and falling over each other like a tidal wave was horrifying, there is so much great tension in this film. Also, the actors they got to play the zombies were fantastic in the way they moved and contorted. The movie also didn't need to use disgusting visuals to get it's point across, which zombie films/series do quite often.Every character had personality. I don't personally know any of the actors in this film, but they made a lasting impact on me! Everyone was great, but the 2 that stood out the most to me were the dad (Seok-woo) played by Yoo Gong and Yong-guk played by Woo-sik Choi. Both played emotion with such expression and guttural tones that I felt their performances were the most noteworthy. Also... Woo-sik Choi is very cute, so I'll be checking him out in ""Parasite"" as well.When character die throughout this movie, you feel the loss. Which is the greatest compliment you can give a film like this. The action and drama flowed very well together, even when the scenes were slower paced I was still invested. Definitely check this one out and give foreign films a chance! Don't use reading subtitles as an excuse to skip fantastic movies like this one, it just makes you look lazy!"
" Quite a ride! It was fun and action packed... and sad
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,10,I cried. yep! i actually cried in this zombie movie. Loved the characters and I'd love a sequel. thanks!!!!
" If Disney made a zombie movie.
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,10,"To be honest, If Disney made a zombie movie. This would be it, it's a suspense, horror, thrill rush. Also has your typical villain, and your sad parts."
" The ego in the panic
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,8,"The plans, the direction, the rhythm, the character development, swim do nothing without any reason, suspense well taken and perfect rhythm, the bad thing is the poor vfx and not showing the origin of the plague I think"
" Not a typical zombie movie
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,9,"Wow, this movie is incredibly intense emotionally. The characters are all designed very well, so even if they seem like bad people at times or have done something wrong, you still are rooting for them because they have learned from their wrongs and are obviously being affected by them (except for one guy). It was surprising how real some of the movie felt, in terms of it not being the typical movie where everything predictably just barely goes perfectly for the main characters. This movie didn't sacrifice realism for plot convenience as much as some other movies which made it very tense and gripping. That said, there definitely were some times that they used plot convenience to set up to play with the audience's emotions, but it wasn't overdone. At times, the acting was kind of off, but I tried thinking about how they should have acted in those situations instead and couldn't think of how to execute what needed to be done. Some of the situations were just way too intense emotionally to really even know how someone would actually react in them. I enjoyed the music and camerawork as they both added to the movie quite a bit. I don't have much negative to say about this film, it was really well done and way better and more thought provoking than I anticipated.As for symbolism, themes, morals, etc., I didn't expect a zombie movie to be very deep, but Train to Busan really does force you to consider things. The main theme is finding a balance between sacrificing your own best interest for the good of others and putting yourself first. When should you ignore others in need to save yourself? Should you ever? How much of yourself should you sacrifice to help others? These questions are constantly addressed throughout the movie. The entire zombie outbreak was started because of negligence of the well being of others. There is a conflict between the father and his daughter in the beginning that is caused by him not being there in her life because he is always busy with work. His work has even caused his wife to leave him. He was obviously doing it all for his daughter's future, but when is the sacrifice too much and how should it be balanced properly? He learns early on that his daughter thinks of others a lot and does what she can for them, whereas he thinks only of himself a lot of the time which she notices and dislikes. As the story goes on, you can see a noticeable change in his actions as he becomes more and more giving until eventually he has to make the ultimate sacrifice to save his daughter. Along the way, some of his actions have almost instant karma where he will decide to risk helping someone and then they end up saving him soon after or he doesn't take the risk and it causes some sort of conflict for him. There are many characters who made great sacrifices for others and I think he saw that and always took note and saw the result of the sacrifice which helped him change and do the same. There is also a character who is entirely greedy and even sacrifices other for himself and although he does make it pretty far, he ends up infected which is very telling of where that route will get you.All in all, I believe that Train to Busan is a great film all around and is entirely worth watching, whether you want an emotional, gripping, or thought provoking experience."
" Excellent movie but disgusting users...
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Why are you all talking about the cheerleader, damn people, this is an excellent movie, and not because of her damn legs, but because of the story, the scenario and the suspense.
You are all going to make me puke with your comments."
" Could have been a 7.5
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,6,Why draw out of all things a Zombie film lol. The last decade since they replaced the Vampire craze they won't leave me alone lol. The social commentary is funny in a dark sense but can't really hit the nerve as it should because we're dealing with Zombies.. what made me drop this to a six was again length and an overbearingly cheesy attempt at a tearful ending it went from comical Zombie Apocalypse with screw the selfish to some sort of redemption...There's no room for redemption on that scale in a Zombie movie lol
" Best Zombie Movie so farr
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,10,I absolutely loved this movie. The ending part made me cry. I have never cried before that hard. My best zombie movie so far.
" Korean zombies are the best
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,10,"By far, the greatest zombie movie I have seen. The zombies are terrifying, the characters are interesting and the setting is fantastic."
" Best Zombie movie ever!
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,10,"As clear as day after watching ths movie I'm totally convinced that this Korean Zombie movie is the best zombie movie ever made. It is breathtakingly exciting with a whole range of interesting scenarios on and off the train. To top all that there is a relatable bunch of characters father and daughter husband and wife etc that are involving, endearing and clearly identifiable. In terms of excitement and enjoyability this is just way above WWZ or Zombieland and all the other recent zombie movies."
" Holy crap
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,9,"It's probably the best zombie movie of the 2010's. It's well written, well acted and good to look at."
" I liked it, you probably will too.
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,7,"I'm not a horror film buff, but I still like to watch them on occasion; especially foreign films. This movie came onto my radar via Reddit and wasn't disappointed. I was engaged and glued to the screen the entire movie.The story was good, the acting was good too. The thing about hype is it sets this imaginary bar in our heads to be as good as movies we adore and think are the best of the best. In reality, these movies never fully hit that bar you're looking for. Go in with in open mind and watch this pretty good horror film."
" Blown Away
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,9,"Hands down, this movie is up there among the top 5 zombie movies of all time. It keeps yo on your seat and sometimes even has you yelling at the screen.There are maybe two scenes that are a little silly and don't fit, but you'll over look them because the rest of the movie is so freaking perfect.This is a MUST SEE for an horror / zombie fan. These undead are crazy man."
" Not just another zombie movie
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,10,"While it does have many similar components to other zombie movies, this stands above and beyond most. The acting is good, as is the storyline. Exceptional cinematography. Well worth the watch."
" Possibly best zombie fare I have yet seen after Resident Evil
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,10,If you want to know what Train to Busan is like then think World War Z (2013) without the need to pay homage to Brad Pitt the scientist action hero. Busan is much more a touching tale of an ordinary man and his cute as pie daughter caught up in world slamming events. Those events broil away just as the train is leaving and then spill like angry snakes and writhing intestines at every survivable turn right through to the hold on to your seat ending. Amazing cinematography combined with amazing scenes of thrashing humanity. This one is worth every penny.
" AMAZING
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,10,"Movies NEVER make me cry, but this storyline is so realistic, and has so much emotion in it. Everything about it was so good, even the small parts including ""She will understand why you leave for work so much, and fathers sacrifice themselves, Because its their job."" Even the part when su-an (The little girl) Doesnt finish her song because she wanted her dad to be their, At the end she finishes it for him because she wants him to be their as su-an and yu-mi escape to freedom. This movie is amazing and i would recommend this to anyone."
" Great Movie- some bad in these reviews
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie at 2am and was hooked, found myself holding my breath, cheering on characters, angry at some and overall enthralled. Its not a perfect movie by no stretch of the imagination. There were times when the tunnels were supposed to be 2 minutes long but end up being 10 minutes in reality. Nevertheless, the cast chemistry and overall acting was superb! I always feel like all zombie movies seem the same but this one had funny moments, loving moments and very sad moments.Now for the comments on the female characters. I see some people commenting on the legs, breast, thighs and other parts of the cheerleader like she is some object and thats just repulsive. Some others felt the need to point out the the pregnant character was ""ok"" as if that was more to turn off the male viewers rather than a major plot of the story. Showing us how fathers do sacrifice so much and sometimes get very little praise. He gave his life up in the movie for his pregnant wife and baby who he has not even met. I rarely leave a review but this is the first I have done so and also the first I have seen a female character commented on like a piece of meat."
" Good action film but...
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,8,"Is this really a zombie film? I am not a genre expert so I am wondering whether this is truly a zombie film: the hordes have never been buried. Also, it seems that infection comes as a result of an airborne virus and not through contact.
The acting is fine. I also like the theme of greedy capitalist industrialist not caring for society.Finally, to the comments: the schoolgirl  but I think she is not a cheerleader. She is dressed in her school uniform because this is field trip."
" One of the best zombie films in recent times
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,9,"Not often does a film surprise me as much as Train to Busan did. I went into it with high expectations, but this movie easily crushed them. As a fan of not only horror movies but also of zombies in particular, this film manages to show the true terror of a zombie apocalypse, using the setting of the tight corridors of the train to its full advantage.George Romero may have created the zombie genre, but this film truly uses all the techniques at hand to craft a terrifying experience... one that I will not forget for a while.If you have a Netflix account, you would be wasting it by not checking this film out. Easily one of the greatest films on the platform."
" Train to Perfection.
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,10,"In a modern world full of movies about zombies, when someone makes a twist in the story, they could make something great. ""Train to Busan"" is an example.I don't usually follow movies from Asian countries because they are not my cup of tea but this is in fact more than just that. The plot is reasonably simple but the twist in the story makes it better and unexpected. The chemistry between the father and daughter is lovely, and the rest of the characters include their unique storyline that affects the way things are going to develop.The special effects are impressive, and the acting is excellent. The ending is almost breathtaking. If you love zombies, this is an excellent movie of the genre.PS: I don't detest the idea of a ""Train to Busan"" remake in America. I merely hope is good, it will still be unnecessary but pleasant."
" Good movie for zombie fans (like me)
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,9,"I liked the way they used cameras, intresting story, I didn't see any cool babes though, I liked special effects, like this deer on the beginnig.Nice movie, I would like too see it again."
" EnterTraining film..
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,8,"Really good roller coaster ride of horror and survival, after a zombie outbreak hits Korea and the passengers found a train have to fight to survive."
" Pretty good but not up to the hype
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,6,"I love horror movies, and this is on a lot of peoples lists, so I had to watch it. I'm kind of over zombies, so it didn't do much for me, as it's basically just zombies on a train. There is some good emotional moments, and some of the infected move in creepy ways...but I've seen a lot of better ones, so it won't be near the top of my list."
" Much better than I thought.
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,7,"I originally put this movie on as I was told it was brutal - that is the part that let me down, as it wasn't anywhere near brutal.
On the other hand for a big standard zombie flick this was good. Not great, but watchable and mostly enjoyable. The acting was way better than most non-enligsh horrors and even at one point I wanted to shout no! at the screen, which you don't really get in zombie movies. Wouldn't watch again but is worth a watch if you like zombie films."
" Awesome
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,9,I love zombie movies/shows and I know mosft of them suck but this one really surprised me. It is a great movie! From start to finish you're on the edge of your seat! And maybe even make you shed a tear or two? Lol loved it!
" It is more than a zombie movie
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,8,This is the type of movie u should watch... Without a single minute boring.. Beginning till the end.. It was nail biting end..GREAT movie to watch its got all the contents..climax was super..
" Good zombie flick
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,7,"This is a nice zombie flick on a train, some elements were a bit cheesy but overall it's a nice zombie movie from Korea that all zombie fans genre should watch"
" One hell of an intense, exciting, and emotional ride
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,9,"A motley assortment of passengers on a train going from Seoul to Bosun are put in great jeopardy when they find themselves caught up in a sudden zombie outbreak both on said train and in the outside world as well.Director/co-writer Sang-ho Yeon keeps the gripping story hurtling along at a breathless breakneck pace, takes time to develop the characters, ably builds a tremendous amount of nerve-rattling tension, maintains a tough take-no-prisoners tone throughout, and stages the attack scenes with rousing go-for-the-throat gusto. Most importantly, Yeon and co-writer Joo-Suk Park bring a surprising pronounced element of pathos and humanity to the premise which in turn ensures that there's plenty of genuinely moving heart to go along with all the harrowing horror. The excellent acting by the tip-top cast further keeps the film on track, with especially stand-out contributions from Yoo Gong as negligent workaholic dad Seok-woo, Su-an Kim as his estranged daughter Soo-an, Dong-seok Ma as the brave Sang-hwa, Yu-mi Jung as the pregnant Seong-Kyeong, Eui-sung Kim as selfish business tycoon Yon-suk, Gwi-hwa Choi as a scared homeless guy, and Sohee as perky cheerleader Jin-hee. The infected folks are extremely ferocious and frightening. Proof positive that there's still some invigorating life left in the zombie horror genre."
" Not as good as Resident Evil movies, but the main actor is the sexiest man I've seen!
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,6,"It has some flaws, specially some scenes are a rip-off of War World Z movie, and predictable jumpcares like trash movies, for that I took some points off, it's not like many people say that it's the best zombie movie, but it's pretty entertaining, the main actor is extremely sexy by the way, and the acting are pretty good."
" Unique Zombie Thriller
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,9,A heart-wretching zombie thriller that keeps you glued to your seat from the get-go.Presents a fresh breath to an already overbeaten zombie genre. Definitely a must-watch. Would recommend to friends.4.5/5. More zombie movies should be like this.
" Adrenaline!
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,8,"What an adrenaline rush!This is a thrill-a-minute escape from zombie doom movie that combines the better parts of Snowpiercer with the basic premise of World War Z. There is a freshness to how the survivors wiggle out of one harrowing situation only to find themselves square in another . . . that is, until the last act when the movie descends into genre clichés and predictable action fare. Until then, though, be prepared to be short of breath and on the edge of your seat as a divorced father connects with his estranged daughter in the wildest way possible: on a zombie train!"
" One of the worst zombie movies - Don't waste your time
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,2,"I have no idea why this movie was hyped so much.
All the characters are behaving in the strangest ways, no logical explanation at all.
Everyone wants to go to Busan, never mind that the world is going to hell. That doesn't make sense at all. Do they want to get their next connection? What is this?
Let not forget that the zombies can fall 50 meters from a helicopter and still attack, but some hits with the bat and they go down? Seriously?Don't waste your time on this piece of useless art."
" So ridiculous that its funny
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,7,"I am a fan of Gong Yoo, so I was unrealistically hopeful. Train to Busan was one of the most ridiculous Korean films I have ever watched. Despite this , it held my action to the end. What a bummer!"
" Not a zombie fan but WOW...
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,9,"So as a horror fan you know this movie is on every list as a must see. I'm not a zombie movie fan BUT I am so happy I saw this film. It's so amazingly well done! The acting is great, the action is nonstop and the music is just excellent. There is so much heart in this zombie movie that it feels almost wrong to call it just a zombie movie. There's moments you could cry because the story just captivates you!! The little girl is absolutely adorable and an amazing little actress. Do yourself a favor and watch this!! Believe the hype! So well done."
" Actually really good
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,10,"It's really a great movie, disregard the people dumbing it down.
I'm honestly appalled at all these shallow reviews. When a horror movie actually has depth, you're doing a disservice when you just babble about one girl who's barely in it. This ain't some silly slasher. Y'all are weird for focusing on a girl who gets maybe 10 minutes of screen time during a 2 hour movie, and you're just distracting from the fact that this is a zombie movie that is actually GOOD.Even though it ends up using one of my most hated tropes, this movie is pretty damn good. If you're completely sick of the genre, then maybe not so much. It's gotten difficult over the past decade to make a unique zombie movie, so there are always going to be familiar elements. But, it does focus on a child-parent scenario, which is not used in zombie movies very often (this invoked some of the same feelings as the short film Cargo), and the action is pretty constant so no one can really say it's boring. It definitely exceeded expectations."
" Really great zombie movie! A must watch
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie was freaking awesome! I have no idea why everyone is mentioning the cheerleader, the movie stands on its own!!! It doesn't need any help from a ""pretty cheerleader"". Fantastic sci-fi/zombie film."
" Surprisingly Good
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,8,"This is what I imagine what it might have been like in South Korea during the early days of the zombie outbreak seen in ""World War Z.""The movie does a lot of things right, such as focusing on just a few main characters, keeping the story tight, and having a good mix of fast-paced action and down-times. Sure, its budget was super low compared to WWZ, but this did not in any way hamper the realism or the experience. If anything, I'm rather surprised by how well the movie was made with the money they had available.In fact, it seems relatively very little CGI was used, even for the zombies, which actually makes the movie that much more believable and realistic.With the exception of a few scenes, the acting was mostly superb. Many of the characters are completely believable, even in their frustratingly at times stupidity. The reality is that in times of crises, people behave differently, unexpectedly, and sometimes badly. But some also rise to the challenge. These behaviors are well represented in the movie.The only thing that I found to be difficult to believe is that there weren't more zombies running around in Busan, a city with nearly 4 million people.If you enjoyed WWZ, like I did, you'll definitely appreciate ""Busanhaeng."""
" Glad i watched this AFTER i went to Korea.
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,8,"I put this off deliberately as i just went on a trip to Korea 3 weeks ago and took the train to Busan from Seoul. I wouldn't have put one foot on a train if i'd watched it first, and would have been on the lookout for zombies the whole time. Kudos to KORAIL for putting their name all over this movie though, my local railway sure wouldn't.It was interesting, horrifying, corny, brilliant.... everything all squished into one train. I feel for the little girl though, and her father when he finally did what he did at the movie end. Watch this, but not just before you vacation in Korea, seriously."
" My new favorite zombie movie
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,10,"Train to Busan was a non-stop trip through a phenomenal zombie film. The zombies were truly frightening, and I felt they behaved very realistically in their mad dashes to their targets. It was reminiscent of World War Z, while also giving more consideration to the limits of the human body. This is the first time I've seen a movie where the dead eyes somewhat affected their vision, and I absolutely love that addition.The acting from even the child and the minor supporting roles was absolutely top notch. Even the smallest supporting roles were given so much depth that I was convinced the characters were real people. My only dislikes about the movie were how some characters behaved, but it's also very easy to see how some people really would behave that way in that situation, so I don't fault the movie for including them. It was very obvious the actors really connected with their characters' emotions, and it really paid off to create an epic film that was easy to connect to.Most zombie films show a world where no one has ever heard of a zombie, but Train to Busan was more realistic for the current world. It was fun to see a group that knew the basics of handling themselves, and I loved that, even with this knowledge, they still struggled thanks to some characters' dumb decisions and the total chaos that is expected in that situation. It was an all around fantastic movie that I highly recommend."
" Original and Intense
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,7,The movie started off slowly for me but then I found myself really getting into it. The hero is at times hard to like but starts to redeem himself as things go on. The action scenes are great. The story arcs of the characters quite bold and and I was shocked at times as to the casualties. Nobody is safe in this movie. I found myself towards the end quite unsettled. Not because of the gore or violence but because of the deaths of some of the characters and also the horrible and vile nature of the baddie executive and the other commuters on the train. As always with these movies some of the human survivors are the real monsters amongst us.
" People, this isn't a zombie movie:
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,10,"Why is everyone upset because the ""zombies"" moved too quickly? These aren't zombies but a result of some neurobiological substance. If you watched the movie with well enough attention, his colleague Kim calls to tell him it was YS Biotech who did this. Besides that, the infected just infect others, they don't eat as where a normal zombie not only shambles but also eats their victim."
" Too intense!
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,10,OMGosh. Edge of your seat Vombie action that doesn't make you wait for it. Make sure you have Kleenex at the last 15 mins 😢
" Forgettable, Generic Horror
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,5,"If you want to understand how far the quality of horror movies, and cinema in general, have disintegrated over the years, just watch one of these new-age, current movies, back to back with something like ""Return of the Living Dead,"" (1985.) or ""The Beyond"" (1981). The decline in quality of our entertainment is sad and astonishing. ""Road To Busang"" is another modern zombie movie, utterly indiscernible from all the other current horror crap, with it's flat, cheap cinematography, fake looking CGI, and this desperate need these current zombie films seem to all have, in bringing emotional drama into a genre where it is laughably out of place and just ludicrous. Some exciting zombie chase scenes are present and the large cast is impressive, but we have seen it before, in movies like ""28 Days Later."" Honestly, there is nothing new here, and the only outstanding quality is that little girl, who gives quite an impressive performance in this. On a side note, all the raves and compliments showered upon a cast member who played a cheerleader, made me curious to see what all the fuss was about. Imagine how shocked I was to see the ""Goddess"" is actually some little girl with thin, stringy black hair that looks like a cheap wig for a witch costume, legs like toothpicks and the facial features of a down syndrome victim. Is this the current idea of beauty? Did anyone else wonder where her chin went? Maybe it got eaten by zombies. It seems like the beauty standards have gone down the sewer, along with popular taste in film and music. I find this a bit sad. ""Train To Busan"" is one of those popcorn flicks that you watch once while texting on your phone...something that you forget 5 minutes after you see it. I refer to the majority of current films and music as ""throwaway entertainment."" Nobody is going to be talking about this movie 2 years from now...nobody will even remember it. I also doubt that anyone over the age of 18 that has more than 5 brain cells will think highly of this extended TV show."
" One of the best movies i've seen
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,10,"Frankly, i can't believe there are so many negative reviews. Everyone seems to point out that the zombies are fast etc etc but only a few get what's the movie about."
" Intense and meaningful
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,8,"So much more than a zombie movie, with ton of themes and emotional scenes. That is by far my favorite zombie movie out there. Some twists and boldness that I did not expect. Overall just a great movie.But for me the ending kind of fell flat. The fatty just doing so much in a row kind of pushed me away. It looked like they just wanted to kill off people at the end. Also that took away from the emotional drama when he died. But still it was well executed and I did not think that he would really infect the main character-"
" Tear jerking, best zombie movie.
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,10,"Not only was there so much action, I also got to feel like I was connected with the characters and felt sad whenever certain ones would die.
The ending was especially sad for me and had me weeping like a baby which is unexpected coming from a zombie movie."
" Best movie
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,9,This the best movie among all zombie movoes i have watched. Teaches us what you give comes back to you !!
" Decent, but lacks any real innovation.
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,6,"This movie was quite entertaining, but really lacks any innovation or originality. It's pretty much just another zombie movie. It really adds nothing to the genre. I just wish there was more about this movie to take in, but there's not. I don't see myself ever rewatching this movie, it just isn't that great.The characters are all just okay. As most would agree, the big Jackie Chan-looking guy was the best. The main Dad character was pretty bland. His ending arc was kinda cheesy, like a typical Korean Drama.Then we have the typical over-the-top d-bag villian. The writers went out of there way to get the audience to hate the guy as much as possible. I don't know, just seems cheap, in my opinion. Th villian was pretty lame and cliche.But what's up with so many people gushing over the pretty cheerleader? Don't get my wrong, she is quite pretty, but too many people are making a huge deal out of her beauty when it's not even nesscary. Guys acting like virgins who's never seen a pretty girl before. I've even seen reviews that just talk about this girls looks, and barely review the movie itself, then they rate it like a 9/10 or 10/10, LOL! Why would someone base a movie review off the looks of just one character? That doesn't make sense for a movie review.But for all the characters, they lacked real actual character development. They are all kinda bland, one-note, and with not much real growth. But the movie is more focused on just them escaping zombies. This movie would've been amazing if they developed the characters more and had some originality for the zombie genre.The movie is still worth seeing for the amazing special effects and suspense. It's best watched with friends or girlfriend. But movie is nothing of substance that will stick with you, for me at least."
" A good zombie flick
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,9,"I respect all genres. In zombie horror this movie impressed me. There were really scary and good jump scares. Off late, zombie movies are unnecessary material made and are same old stuff which is already shown in lot many other movies. However, this one was different.A definite one time watch."
" Impressed
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,8,"I got to tell you, I was very impressed with this movie. It's a good solid zombie flick. The ending was pretty cool too."
" Easy 10/10!

" Good not great
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,6,"One of my favorite zombie movie, though parts of it was very predictable. I went into it blind with very little expectation but enjoyed the rollercoaster I was strapped on to.
The characters were okay. I know they were trying to invest a lot of dialogue to keep you emotionally attached to each death but I wasn't feeling it. The hobo guy should've died a long time ago but they kept him around so that there would be someone to save the pregnant women and the kid. The dads death at the end felt forced and was completely unnecessary. He only died for dramatic effect purposes.
I did like one character though, the train conductor. He was always cool, calm, and collective. He tried to save as many people as he could but that ultimately lead to his demise.
It's a good movie but not something I would watch again any time soon.
Though I am intrigue to see how Train to Busan part 2 will unfold."
" I have had it with these mf zombies on this mf train!!!!
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,7,"Korean Zombies (think World War Z) on a train packed with passengers desperately trying to get to Busan. A decent supply of heroes and villains are whittled down in what provides a claustrophobic environment. The limitations of the train are often cleverly exploited with fewer contrived moments. Pace plays a massive role in the movie, that of the zombies and the train, this is balanced with elements of stealth and quiet. As with the best apocalyptic movies the reactions of those in peril and the challenges to social norms are well explored. The characters are earnest and sympathetic, if at times a bit one dimensional.
It does a hell of a lot with must have been a meagre budget, and there's plenty of fun to be had on this rollercoaster. The result may not be up there with the best (28 days/weeks later) but there's something undeniably cool about watching a foreign language action movie, so you can bracket this one with Nikita and The Raid. Not necessarily in terms of quality but in kudos earned. SEVEN"
" Best zombie movie!!!

" I'm not crying you're crying..
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,7,"The movie was pretty good, with some cringy moments but that's easily forgiven. It was a hell of a ride, and it actually made me ugly cry. First zombie movie that made that happen."

" One of the best zombie / horro flicks out there
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,8,"*** This is a fair and even handed review - I'm not one of these idiots that marks either 1 or 10 for every film they watch because they don't understand the context ***Even if ""Train to Busan"" was ""just another zombie film"", it's one of the best out there. Ranking with the originality of Romero's Dead series, through to the panic of ""28 days"" and ""28 weeks later"", and the scale of ""World War Z"". It's a great ""monster in the house"" set up, the house being a train and the surrounding cities and stations - and the monsters, some form of fast infected sprinting zombies, that stop at nothing to prey on the living. It's worth watching just for the sheer carriage to carriage excitement, and the jerking and twisting Zombies as they awaken, along with a fresh take on their abilities.But at heart, it's a beautiful story of a fathers relationship with his daughter, and the sacrifice parents make to keep their children happy and offer them the best in life. It's filled with plenty of additional memorable characters that you form a strong bond with: love, understand, or hate - and plenty in between. It's definitely got a Korean / Manga feel. From the dread of the opening scene, the poignant score, to the special effects, and pacing - it's a great film on it's own, and even better within the genre - which has certainly been hard to do these last 20 years.It's an action packed and emotional roller coaster from start to finish, with plenty of jumping moments and even some tear jerkers!If you're a zombie fan, it's a must see, and almost everyone else will enjoy it too.8/10"
" Must watch
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,10,I have seen this movie 3 times. One of the best zombie movies! But i rally hates the ceo..
" something different
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,10,"Wow this movie I thought was fantastic, first of all when I'm watching a movie where I have to read the captions wasn't something I was accustomed especially when the film was action packed through out , it's one of my favorites. Love it when
Loved it again when watching it after so many years
Now a days everyone seems to be doing a lot of remakes copy this copy that and want credit for something someone initially came up with the idea
But this movie I don't remember seeing anything like it before and to me that made a great impression and great movie."
" Personally, I really love this film
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,10,"People may snark as the plot of the movie, which is fine, look at it for what it is as far as a story.But, this does something that most modern films don't, characters develope, the story unfolds, the theory of relativity actually exists in this universe!! It's almost unheard of in western horror movies, where 'a person does this, and then this stupid thing, after this idiotic decision'. And that's modern cinema in the west.Train to Bus an makes sense from start to finish. It'd MINT!
I've seen it three times, twice when drunk. Still brilliant."
" U GOTTA WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,7,I love this movie!!! It had me on the edge of my seat and had me in tears also. The dad and daughter are my favorite characters in this movie. I was rooting for them the whole time.
" Train to Busan
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,9,"Seok-woo is a workaholic fund manager living in Seoul with his mother and Su-an, his young daughter. She is desperate to see her mother, who lives four hundred and fifty kilometres away in Busan. Eventually her father agrees to take her and together they board the train to Busan. As the train prepares to depart we are introduced to a few other characters; a man and his pregnant wife; a pair of older women; a school girl and her boyfriend a wealthy business executive; a homeless man who keeps saying 'everybody is dead!' and a girl who is behaving strangely. Soon after the train sets off this girl attacks a train attendant... it is clear that she was infected with something that causes extreme violence. It isn't long before more and more become infected and survivors are barricading themselves in the remaining safe parts of the train. If that weren't enough it is clear that the infection is affecting people throughout South Korea.I really enjoyed this South Korean zombie film; it provided tension from soon after the start right to the final scene. The zombies are more like those infected in '28 Days Later' than classic slow shuffling ones some people might not be keen on that but I think so long as they are scary all is good... and these provided the scares. The film nicely establishes rules that these particular zombies follow. Inevitably there are plenty of gory scenes, but nothing too excessive, and it isn't entirely obvious who, if anybody, will survive. The key characters are introduced well and fairly quickly; they include a good cross section of society and both heroes and cowards. Setting the film in the confined space of a speeding train adds an extra danger as there are limited places for survivors to hide safely for any length of time. The cast is solid and make us believe in their characters; similarly the special effects are pretty impressive. Overall I'd say that this is definitely a film to watch if you like zombie movies.These comments are based on watching the film in Korean with English subtitles."
" Train To Busan (2016) merupakan film zombie terbaik sepanjang masa setelah 28 Days Later (2002) dan Dawn of the Dead (2004).

" A Father And A Daughter
",2019-07-18 00:00:00,8,"This movie will one of the best zombie flicks I have ever watched. It begins with a greedy capitalist wanting to have it all, until he takes a train journey with his daughter. That is when the zombie attacks happen. In the movie you are introduced to variety of characters including a husband and his pregnant wife. Two old sisters. A bunch of teeangers. The train driver and the train manager.The movie is primarily about the father who is a hungry capitalist and his innocent daughter. The zombie attacks are shown in ways that will make you move in your seats. The train and the train stations itself looks like a poignant character in the movie. Amazingly shot .Though a zombie movie, the transformation of the father will move you. Specifically that last few minutes, where the father thinks of the birth of his daughter, one last time. It will break your heart as well as leave you with goodness. Watch it. But do get some tissues."
" Terrific Film
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,8,Terrific film! Had everything I wanted for a Saturday night flick. I can't wait to watch this one again. I really think it had something for everyone. Finally a great fun horror film again for me. Mu last few horror flicks have been killing me!
" Zombie Fun With Social Commentary
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,8,"Train To Busan: It got a mediocre review in FT magazine, 5/10. From the opening scenes of a cynical farmer who is told of a minor leak from a Bio-Research Laboratory this film scored high imho. The farmer runs over a deer and after he leaves it comes back to life! He's beHind you!Most of the story takes place on the eponymous train. A Bond Trader is taking his young daughter to his estranged wife in Busan when the Zombie outbreak occurs. These are fast zombies who bite and chomp and swiftly turn their victims into the undead. A School Baseball team use their bats to good effect. Some social commentary as well which would be worthy of Ken Loach but its not laid on with a trowel.The Zombie action works well and we mostly encounter fresh Zombies as they haven't had time to deteriorate. They run, they swarm. Nothing original but its used to good effect as is the character development of the (still) human characters. 8/10"
" Gripping from start to finish - A high speed horror
",2019-07-11 00:00:00,10,"The remake is already on the way so you know this is an excellent film. Action packed and full of truly interesting characters that you want to see survive till the end, Train to Busan transcends cultures to be nail bitingly tense, no matter where you're from. Watch it with a group of people and some popcorn for maximum effect."
" This is how you make a Zombie movie
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,9,An absolute blood fest zombie movie with zombies that make you feel genuine fear with there movement sounds and even dislocated body parts clicking and cracking against the bones as they move the tight spaces of the train gives a clostrophobic feeling especially when there's zombie in both directions and knowhere you can run too.The movie follows a father and daughter who take a train journey to Busan for the daughters birthday but the same day a zombie outbreak occurs and as the train leaves the station a frantic woman boards the train who brings the infection with her and from one bite to the next the train quickly becomes overrun with zombies the passengers in a panic make it to the far end of the train and bar the door while hearing those behind them scream in terror but that was only beginning of this night now the survivors on the train must survive until they reach the end of the line if there is one anymore.The movie is in Korean with English subtitles and I have to say the acting is very good from everyone involved the directing is marvelous the make up and effects look amazing the zombies look better than big budget Hollywood movies with lots of blood injury detail and the way the zombies body's move and contract is something I've never seen before it had me in Awww of just how amazing it looks.I recommend this movie to any Horror movie and zombie fan it's worth your time 100% it's a zombie movie done right and with all the let down zombie movies of the modern day this movie shows Hollywood up and says this is how it's done.

" Tear jerking scene odd.
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,7,"Overall a good zombie movie. I hate when zombies run, but it makes the movie more suspenseful. However Korean movies have these formulaic scenes where they try to squeeze tear drops out of the movie goers' eyes, scenes daring the audience to not shed tears. Very offputting IMO."

" Finally, a terrific zombie movie.
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,7,"In the last few years, especially about a decade ago, we were extremely flooded with zombie movies, both horror, comedy and even drama, however, a large majority of these ended up being mediocre movies and completely forgettable. Years later, in the middle of 2016, the fantastic South Korean filmmakers decide to change that and give us an entertaining, brilliant and original zombie story.Filled with fantastic scenes, fast-paced action and fabulous performances, Train To Busan is a great zombie movie full of emotional moments and well-built suspense, set in what is a modern city and at the same time, the claustrophobic atmosphere of a train. The film is made to entertain, from beginning to end does not bore, finally a film of this type that is really worthwhile to pass the time. Good cinematography, great scenes, an intelligent script, complex characters, fantastic effects and sentimental scenes make of this movie a redemption for the genre, and as an extra, one more proof of the ability of South Koreans to make incredible movies."

" Hits All The Genre Tropes With Thrilling Aplomb, And Gives Food For Thought Also
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,8,"(ONE SLIGHT SPOILER)Genre movies can get a rough critical ride - if a movie, film, book or whatever - hits all the expected beats and notes one might expect, it's easily dismissed. It's said to have done nothing meaningful, to be derivative. But as long as we've been telling stories, genres have been important - they provide comfort and a structure to tell a story that we feel safe with and understand.Additionally, to dismiss genre art misses something very significant; many of humanity's greatest artists have worked within the strictures of the genre. Shakespeare is an example par excellence of this - most of his plays fit an established contemporary genre. What is exceptional in them is how he develops character and themes within these genres, whilst still pleasing those who came along for the comfort of the predictable (as well as the sublime language, of course).South Korea action-horror movie Train To Busan is a genre movie with the highest of high concepts: zombies on a train. If that doesn't get a horror-action fan's juices flowing, then little will. It's stark and efficient; as characters board a train, a zombie outbreak (the word is only used once in the film) hits the world outside and inside the train. The action sequences are visceral and thrilling; making full use of the train's geography, and the rare sequences outside the train work equally effectively without disrupting the claustrophobic, trapped tone.For the genre fan looking further, there's more to see. An incisive, satirically edged, take on the walls, customs and strictures we put around each other and others to protect our standing in families and societies.(slight spoiler)The fatal flaw of this zombie outbreak is that the zombies can only hunt what they can see. This means a couple of things - it adds some great wrinkles to action sequences when the train unpredictably enters or emerges from a tunnel, for example. But this idea also plays up the themes of the film, especially in the well-timed lull in advance of the film's final act as these ideas are given more space to breathe than in other similar films.A key plot moment in the last twenty minutes tries to present some redemption and hope; I'm not convinced it works tonally or plot-wise; the ultimate conclusion a necessary upbeat that unsurprisingly allows a sequel should box office permit (it did - a sequel is in production).It's not a perfect film, but this first live-action movie from the director promises much to watch with interest in years to come."
" BEST EMOTIONAL ZOMBIE DISASTER ACTION FILM EVER MADE!!!!!!
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,8,"Alright, so the only reason i didnt give this a 9 or 10 is because it needs a lot of action and violence for that but now for the review. This movie was clearly the best zombie disaster film ever made and the movie captures that and shows that very well. The only problem i have is that its not in English but in the end i dont really care and its not really about that. The ending is the real best part, it is very emotional and you are guaranteed to at least start to cry because i did. The zombie scenes in this movie are scary and super cool especially the first sighting of the zombies, omg you have to see this. This is like a whole new experience of scary. horror, and disaster. If this was rated r and had more gore and was in English then it would most likely be a 9 or a 10 but actually i think its better without it because it feels more sad and more realistic to the viewer. This movie is like a masterpiece in the end and there probably not another movie like this one. You have to see this movie. And the beginning was cool with the whole deer thing and that might be what cause the disease with something on the truck with the deer idk. Great movie overall and when i was watching this movie i didnt want it to end because of how good it was. A very good emotional disaster film."
" Wow. One of the better zombie films out there.
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,9,"Busanhaeng, more commonly known in the west as Train to Busan, focuses primarily on a hard-working man who frequently puts his work before his young daughter. The man, Seok-woo, takes his daughter on an early train headed from Seoul to Busan in order for her to see her mother. What happens when they board the train, well it is quite obvious what happens. Nevertheless, Train to Busan involved a broad range of characters, although they were cliche, that offered an experience of how people reacted to their surroundings and what they were willing to do in order to survive. There is relief and heartbreak along the way, but Train to Busan is certainly the best modern zombie film, and one of the best films I have recently seen. Train to Busan 2 is supposedly in the works for a 2020 release, and I cannot wait to see how the journey continues and what is next for our cast."
" An engaging and suspensful zombie thriller
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,8,"Train to Busan is hard to put a pin in. Half of the time it plays like one of the most developed and enthralling zombie films to date, but the other half it plays like a B movie. Act I is rock solid through and through. The rules of the virus and the world it is in were laid on the line clear as day, following a respectable amount of time spent developing our main characters. The rest of the film is plagued by inconsistency with how the virus and the characters behave, which ultimately cripples the film. Even with this hindrance, Train to Busan is not an action film to miss."
" The train to Busan
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,7,"The Train to Busan is a thrilling horror unlike any I have seen before. Director Sang-ho Yeon puts his own spin on a large scale zombie outbreak, after a chemical lab releases a deadly virus. Unsuspecting passengers board a train that will cause them to see much more than the little girls mother. Innocent passengers must endure the seemingly never-ending train ride to Busan as they watch the cities of Korea fall around them, after a plant known for making mistakes releases the airborne virus. Although it as an apocalyptic style zombie fight-for-survival type movie, I wouldn't put it in the same category as some of the other prominent titles in the genre such as I Am Legend, or even World War Z.Sang-ho Yeon added a new twist and stayed away from the typical 'tough guy gunning down zombies to save the world' approach of many similar movies, and focused on capturing the chaos happening during an apocalypse in the dense modern urban setting of South Korea. The characters consistently keep the audience on the edge of their seat because of the deeper emotional connection we are able to establish at the beginning by being able to relate to them. Because the language utilized in this movie is Korean it allowed me to focus more on character's emotions and facial expressions; this, however, does not take away from the film in my opinion. One of the key strengths of this film is the breathtaking camera work and shot choice, that helps engage the audience on a new level as we are immersed into their world. A large range of film techniques are used in this film and the utilization of subjective point of view shots greatly add to the already immersive film. South Korea being the setting of the film gives the audience an inquisitive urge to keep watching as each turn and bend is foreign to us. The director's definitive choice of setting for each shot aids the suspense and ""on your toes"" feeling for the duration of the movie. Unlike many of the other apocalyptic movies many of us have seen, the acting in this film is absolutely phenomenal. Going into this movie I had very low expectations for quality of acting, especially since I did not recognize any of the cast from previous movies. Each actor elegantly played their roles and spared no emotion. This blew me away as most other movies I've seen like this have focused on making a few characters look badass as they power their way through crowds of zombies, but this movie was different. Each character felt real and as the audience we really connect with them, feeling like we would have made the same choices.A combination of intricate detailed set pieces, carefully chosen shots, and remarkable acting took this seemingly average zombie apocalyptic movie, to an invigorating emotionally engaging thriller that contracted my attention throughout. Not once did I feel like checking my phone or going to the bathroom, as this movie had me completely immersed from the opening scene to the the final credits."
" Very good film
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,10,"Lots of action and fun ride
Definitely not the typical zombie flicks
I'm use to watching
In fact... not one bullet was usedThe REAL villain of the story
was that COO guy who killed more innocent
to save himself.
I kinda didn't like the
how the hero allowed hero dad allowed
him to turn full zombie before killing him
If anyone deserve to die as a human
it was that COO business man"
" Tense and suspenseful
",2019-05-22 00:00:00,8,"Needed to set up an account so I could write a review that focused on the movie, instead of some creepy ass review of the attractiveness of the women in the movie. Seriously, get it together dudes.The first 10-15 minutes on the train build tension perfectly. So many little, freaky puzzle pieces that come together at just the right time and then never. Ever. Stop.I liked this take on zombie lore. It's claustrophobic. It gives enough character development so that it's not just blood and gore. But it definitely has a good amount of blood and gore, if that's your thing. I've now watched this movie a second time and the suspense and tension still holds up."
" Good movie for people and zombies
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,9,"Excellent film recommended by my daughter RJ. I wish all films were this good and agree with her that character development, story lines, pace, everything just top notch. It also does something else; it makes you want to seek out films by this director and see more. I can't wait to watch it again."
" Great zombie film even though it's Korea's the first zombie film ever.
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,10,"Train to Busan is Korea's the first zombie film and also one of the best zombie films of all time. I rarely watch Korean films, but when I saw this film, I was totally surprised because it's the first.As the film name, Train to Busan, the whole thing happened on the train. So, the filming location scope is small but it turned out great. What I like of this film is it shows if you don't want to die, you'll die quicker than usual. So, we don't need to afraid of dying. We all have to die one day anyway. No one can avoid it.I really hate that CEO guy. The way he try to survive by pushing all people around him to die is something I hate most. And also I hate Koreans always love to kill off the main character(s), making the film unhappy ending. If they make the film end with some kind of happy ending, it'd be better than this.The makeup skills, special effects used in this film and performances of actors and actresses are good, so that the film becomes better and better. Even though this film is the first zombie film that Koreans ever made, it's like they had a lot of experiences with zombie films. They could make a great one on the first go.Although there are some things that I don't like in this film, it still makes one of the best zombie films I've ever watched. It's enjoyable, so, I recommend you all to watch it."
" Excellent Korean Zombie Flick
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,9,"This was actually a quite refreshing take on the Zombie genre. Fast-paced, decent acting, superb special effects and all in all a crazy 2 hour train ride.It showed the ugly side of selfishness, the brutal side of loss, I even cried a bit at the end.Camera work was great, good score, all in all very watchable. Give it a go!!!"
" IT'S INTERESTING!! LET'S WATCH IT
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,9,"Actually, at first I'm not really interesting about this movie. Almost all of my friends talk about this movie a lot. Although a little bit late, finally i had watched this movie and i like it so much.
This is a Korean movie which about zombies attack in the train. The story is amazing and I as a viewer can't guess anything during I watch it. During watching this movie I also can feel the emotions felt by the actors and actresses. That fear, worry, and disgust when I see the zombie.
And I think, this movie is not just about a zombie movie. There's a implied message that tells us about humanity. How to be kind each other even though you don't know that person. How to helping each other in urgent circumstances. And how not to think just about yourself.
I am also surprised that I had cried when I saw one of the scene I feel really touched my heart. It teach that love between a children and their parents is truly pure. Although sometimes their actions show otherwise, but that is only to cover up their pride.
I just want to say, I RECOMENDED THIS MOVIE!! So don't you dare, you're not watch this movie hahaha"
" Sooooo GOOD!!!!!!
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the ONLY zombie movies where people do the intelligent thing! Smart, well written characters you actually want to survive because they don't act like blow up dolls with jello for brains. The most annoying part of any horror movie is the main characters responding to situations in moronic ways that no normal person would ever respond. No doubt Hollywood will soon remake it and lose everything that makes this movie believable/awesome. Regardless, this is a GREAT movie. This is an OUTSTANDING zombie movie. For every 50 predictable/annoying/poorly acted/directed/written/shot movies - this is the ONE worth watching!"
" Love and Death
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,8,"It's just an amazing film that shows the growth of love through experiences together. Not only does it have a good character story, but it also has a good plot and setting to go along with it. Definitely would recommend."
" Visual storytelling at its best.
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,10,"Train to Busan is proof that with effective visual storytelling, you don't need exposition. I watched this movie in Japanese with Japanese subtitles, and despite my Japanese being just ""Ok"" I was able to understand everything the movie was trying to convey. Sometimes simple is best.The film starts off with a protagonist who comes across as selfish and unlikeable, but slowly becomes the hero as the story progresses. However Train to Busan manages to do this without shoving it down the viewer's throat. None of the characters seem like important people with special knowledge, they're all just normal people in a bad situation trying to survive.The choice to confine the story on a train, for the most part, helps the viewer feel a sense of claustrophobia throughout the film and it makes every action the characters make a little more nail biting.While Train to Busan may not be the most original idea, it proves not everything has to be. When done well, even the oldest stories can still make a viewer feel fear, tension, and apprehension for 2 hours."
" Zombie Train straight to hell...
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,8,"This movie is just a fantastic ride. Literally. Well not for them. The nearly non-stop train reflects the non-stop fight for survival. Even after so many zombie movies have been and gone, it's great that we still get new 'versions' and new environments to experience them in. There's some great ""oh god, get OUT of there quick!"" moments that are so much fun. I love my zombies, and this didn't disappoint!"
" I Laughed, I cried, I was entertained!
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,9,"I avoided watching this one for the longest time because of the subtitles, but with all the action, there's not a lot of dialogue. You go through an emotional roller coaster. There are some sour tarts, funny parts, some sitting on the edge of your seat parts. An essential for the zombie lover."
" Korean Zombies Done Right
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,7,"I've seen this film mentioned elsewhere and saw it come up in my Netflix recommendations a few times so I thought I'd give it a try - especially since the user rating is impressive for Netflix and it was nominated for and won some awards.In essence, it's a fairly typical zombie horror flick but the emphasis is a complex family dynamic and mental struggle of survivors on the train from Seoul to Busan. Nobody suddenly becomes a ninja warrior or a military arms expert and not everyone lives to the end of the movie. I think that differentiates it from standard Hollywood zombie fare and makes it more compelling in the end.The acting is pretty solid and the special effects are (even though sometimes comical) surprisingly high-quality. Even though zombies are kind of played out at this point I'd recommend giving this one a lazy, rainy day viewing."
" Interesting And Abit scary
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,7,"Should have more jumpscare and More gun actions,Further more 7/10 I like the zombies and The main characters.Keep it up! More zombies movie in the future(IRON MAN DIED IN ENDGAME!,SPOILERRRR)"
" Train to Busan
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,7,"Train to Busan (Busanhaeng) is a South Korean survivalist zombie movie.It owes more to the Hollywood disaster movies on the 1970s such as The Poseidon Adventure or the Airport films.Seok-woo is a divorced fund manager. A workaholic who never has much time for his young daughter Su-an. They board a train so she can visit her mother. An injured young woman scrambles onto the train before it leaves Seoul. She had been bitten and becomes infected by some type of virus that turns her into a flesh eating zombie.As she bites others, they too become infected and in turn attack other passengers and staff. Some of the survivors try to move quickly to the safe carriages.Survivors include Seok-woo and his daughter, a pregnant woman and her macho husband, two elderly sisters, members of a high school baseball team, a selfish tycoon and a few others. As the train journey continues, they get picked off one by one.The zombies have been inspired by World War Z as at times they can be fast moving. The director has done well in maintaining tension and a claustrophobic atmosphere before moving the action to other places.The characters are nicely fleshed out and this is one of the better zombie movies."
" Surprising
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,9,"Given that half the reviews are debating the cheerleader's body rather than the movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. It certainly packed an emotional punch and proved more than worth the try. Phenomenal zombie flick."
" Beautifully done thrill ride
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,9,"After telling my girlfriend that Train to Busan was an amazing movie, I found I couldn't quite tell her why. It doesn't really have any of those moments you talk about after or anything; it's a movie that's simply really engrossing and exciting on a minute-by-minute basis rather than one with amazing set pieces.It starts slowly, setting up a bunch of characters in a way that reminds me of 70s disaster movies like The Poseidon Adventure. A neglectful father and his young daughter, a couple of middle-aged ladies, a bunch of school kids, all taking a train trip. Then there's a sick passenger who comes back from the dead and suddenly a zombie virus is tearing through the train like wildfire.Trapped on a moving train, and seeing the outside world is also in the grip of zombies, a shrinking set of passengers fights for survival, beset by zombies as well as the worst of human nature.The movie is beautifully structured. There is a lovely compactness to the way characters are introduced; you quickly have a sense of who they are and become invested. The pace is fast and disasters come on on another like dominoes.It's not too gory, which is how I like my horror. It's really closer to something like The Birds or Jurassic Park, and is as much action and suspense as horror. You should watch it."
" The very definition of a mondo midnight movie!
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Part horror and part satire, this is an exceptional movie that drags you screaming along at bullet-train speed. Extraordinary tension is counterbalanced with eerie calm, as survivors embark and disembark in quiet fear."
" Train to butt stain haha
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,2,"This movie stinks. Here's the setup: a man works too much and has a daughter, and they're going to take a train to see the girl's mother. Got it? Good, time to get to the action.Zombies show up. The only kind of cool part of the whole movie is the creepy way zombies tend to come pouring out of windows and doors. That's seriously the highlight. People stand around like slack-jawed cattle waiting to be slaughtered. They watch people get eaten alive, with expressions on their faces that suggest they're instead looking at somebody being mildly rude at the dinner table. The undead monsters blessed with superhuman speed are able to kill rooms full of people seemingly within a minute or two. However, when they try to kill one of the main characters, they're about as dangerous as a chihuahua with teeth made of bubblegum. Doubly so if they go against the big cool guy, who can beat down train cars full of zombies without breaking a sweat. Anybody bitten by a zombie turns into a bloodsucking monster within 10-30 seconds, unless they're a main character or antagonist, in which case it takes forever so that it's DRAMATIC.This movie has the good old fashioned 'let those people die, because maybe they're infected' cliche. Except it doesnt make ANY SENSE because like I just said, people TURN WITHIN 30 SECONDS.One by one the protagonists sacrifice themselves heroically, and the bad guy tries to kill them for actually, literally no reason. Also the zombies can't see in moderately dim lighting conditions, and they can't catch up to a lady who is about 7-8 months pregnant.At the end, the little girl and the pregnant woman are the only ones alive. They're about to get sniped for no good reason, until the girl sings the song she wanted to sing for her dad I guess. Everybody's heart strings get horribly tugged. Or if they're like me, they thank god that it's over. Frustrating, inconsistent, illogical, cliche, completely lacking in tension. It's bad."
" One of the best modern zombie movies
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Train to Busan is a simple yet effective film. The visual storytelling is excellent. Objectives are clear, great pacing, the characters make decisions, decisions that have some semblance of internal logic guiding them. The main characters have arcs, and the action is tense and exciting. There are a few memorable and well written escape/tactical scenarios that are lacking in a lot of action movies today."
" My first experience with a Korean movie was exceptional
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,9,The movie was awesome! You can not anticipate what will happen. Innovative and originality in every aspect of the story. I highly recommend it ander looking forward for other koorian movies
" Fantastic
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,9,"I have seen many zombie movies, I am a bit of a horror fan and I can sum this up very simply.It is in my opinion the very best zombie movie I have ever seen, by a clear mile."
" Very much like black summer but lacking one thing
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,8,I absolutely loved this movie and surprisingly didnt mind watching it from another language. Normally I hate movies from other languages. The plot seemed extremely good but am pretty upset they killed all the actors at the end of it besides the kid and wife (of the cool dude) of course. Would absolutely watch the next one if it comes out. Overall awesome movie they were just missing a few things and the story line could of been a bit better and not just be in a train the entire time.
" Simply the best.
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,10,My headline says it all Train to Busan is simply the best zombie movie ive seen in a while entertaining throughout. The Actors are superb and you care for them so quickly and are fully invested as soon as it all goes down on the Train.This is a Zombie movie but it's also a movie about a Dad and his Daughter and what a father would do and what lengths he would go to keep her safe.Truly a Zombie Masterpiece.
" Excellent!!
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,10,"This was one of the best zombie films I've seen. It has several sub-plots, intense action, lots of suspense. At first you'd wonder how a movie with zombies on a train could span 2 hours, but this film did it outstandingly well! I could easily have watched it going on for another hour.The scenarios are realistic (well as realistic at can be for there being zombies 🙂).The film also presented a theme of man's inhumanity to man on one side, and the selflessness of man for his brother on the other side - all in the midst of a life and death struggle. This was set up very well early on.It was interesting to observe the evolution of the main character as things progressed.It may not be to everyone's taste, it's not as gore-filled as some other films (though there is carnage a-plenty).Overall, I trilling film."

",2019-03-22 00:00:00,9,"All in all, a great take on the Zombie genre!! Excellent scenes of violence and Gore. Fast paced and fun. Just one question, why did the dad buy a Wii when this movie was released in 2016?? Wii U and switch we're already out. This is the only problem I have. Lol. Love this movie though ^^"
" I really great take on a zombie film.
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,7,"This take of a zombie film did very well. The zombies weren't over the top and they moved with a purpose. You also get a real connection with the characters. It is a foreign film so you have to read subtitles, but it was worth it."
" Train to Busan: Action, Horror, and Sadness.
",2019-03-14 00:00:00,9,"Train to Busan is a movie that you probably haven't heard about. I didn't either until my dad forced me to watch it with him. He didn't tell me much about it, except that it was a zombie movie. We've seen zombie movies, the cliche walking corpses and the race to survive. I figured it would be just like them, and wasn't prepared for much. Boy, was I wrong. If you can get past the subtitles, you should brace yourself for an emotional, action-packed and morally challenging adventure, as there is nothing like this movie and I doubt there will be for a long time. Unlike well-known zombie-horror films/shows like The Walking Dead or World War Z, Train to Busan manages to create an emotional attachment to the characters. Even though the main character starts out as a prick, we still feel for him and want to see him improve. It kind of reminds of me of the movie Shaun of the Dead, in the sense of a unique approach to the cliche. Shaun of the Dead takes a more comedic and wacky approach to the cliche, with some hints of seriousness, and Train to Busan takes a serious and somewhat realistic approach, with some comedic moments, which is a good balance. The movie somehow packs in these emotional attacks with exciting unique action into a two-hour film, making it hands down the best zombie survival movie along with providing a unique and enjoyable experience.The film starts with the main character Gong Yoo (It's Korean) sitting in an office space and is depicted as a supervisor or administrator of a large corporation. He returns home for his daughter's birthday, late, and gives her a Wii U, which she already got from her mom. He also missed her singing performance, causing her to lose confidence and stutter out of singing. Right off the bat, we know that he's not the best father, but he still cares for her. Things get serious when they board a train to the city Busan to see her mother, as a strange and hysterical woman sneaks on board. Of course, that woman is what you would call a zombie, and thus the classic virus spreading action begins. While their whole city is worrying about their own zombie attack, we get to see it from the point of view of train passengers who are cramped in a small linear passage trying to survive.If you were to just look up the movie and take a glance at it, it would look silly. It's hard to make a zombie movie not look ridiculous. Now before you say ""Well it's a zombie movie, isn't that silly?"" While that is true, the movie somehow takes a silly and cliche concept and magically turns it into something serious, exciting, and original. Of course, there are some inescapable unrealistic moments; such as train security not noticing a clearly strange woman without a ticket board the train, or nobody regarding the woman while on the train. Those are just nit-picky things you can't avoid.Every movie has its faults, yet the faults in Train to Busan don't even come near to how amazing the film is. As I've said before, the pure emotional value packed in with exciting action makes it so great. I don't know exactly how they did it, but I can tell you that the two ""Us vs Them"" and ""Me vs Us"" themes play a big role. Us vs them is pretty obvious; a group of strangers banded together to fight the evil zombies outside, sharing resources and information. However, the Me vs Us theme goes a bit deeper. Would you sacrifice everything for a bunch of strangers you just met on a train? Or would you abandon them in hopes to survive on your own? We witness the characters go through these decisions and change as the story progresses. Gong Yoo was a businessman who wouldn't raise a thumb to help the poor, yet later on, he risks his life for a homeless man by turning back to help him up to run from a horde of zombies. After watching the movie I felt the effects of its message.Along with moral challenges, by the end of the movie, you will shed a tear. Trust me. You will feel sorrow for the characters. This is one of the few movies where I actually felt sad after watching it, and that's saying something for being a zombie movie. I definitely wasn't prepared for it, and it hit me like, well, a train. A lot of movies you will forget about after a couple of weeks, and some you will hold on to for a very long time. This is one of those that you will hold on to."
" Best zombie film around
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,10,"Honestly, When I first bought this film the only thing I knew about it was that it was a zombie film.But watching this film without having much prior knowledge about it creates a better viewing experience.This film is perfectly filmed in regards of setting. Referring to the train. It allows for a realistic sense of claustrophobia making scenes that much more suspenseful. Nowadays it feels like there is no originality within films however this film is different from the rest.It nails all aspects of what a good film should be. The incredible story allows for a simplistic but powerful ending. The acting should be mentioned as a big plus, with all actors providing an outstanding performance which gives the story a sense of verisimilitude.This film is a perfect example of what horror should be."
" it's not a zombie movie
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,10,"Yup, it's different. although zombies are the central element of the storyline, this movie just about zombies and survival and that's what i loved about this movie.
It's about decisions we make. its about the good and bad in us. its about that transformation between good & evil and Yeon Sang-ho tries to show it in almost every part of the movie. with an ending of so much stillness after an intense action scene this movie is a masterpiece in itself."
" Fear the commuting dead
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,8,"In this fine Korean entry in the 'fast-moving zombie' sub-genre, a diverse group of survivors find themselves sharing the linear confines of a high-speed train with ravenous undead, hoping to eventually reach safe haven. I watched an English subtitled version, but thought that the cast was very good, especially 10-year old Kim Su-an as Su-an and Gong Yoo as Seok-woo, her fund-manager father who is forced to re-examine his values in light of the grisly apocalypse. The film is somewhat uneven in the capacities of the hyper-animated corpses to absorb punishment but otherwise the story holds together pretty well (considering the premise is a communicable agent that near instantaneously turns a bitten person into a milky-eyed, frenetic cannibal). Well-made and smoothly directed, 'Train to Busan' is an entertaining entry into a generally bloated genre and impressively for a zomboid film, pulls off affecting, almost moving, ending."
" creatively mind-blowing
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,9,"Directed by Yeon Sang-ho, Train to Busan immediately earns a place in the canon of great zombie cinema. Layered, emotional, and riveting, the South Korean product blends human drama, thematic depth, and jolting horror in its tale of commuters trapped within a train while an epidemic rages without. The production is sleek, the violence is biting, and the characters are worth investment. It is the rare horror film whose spirit and energy engender the desire to watch the work again immediately after the credits roll."
" Waste of time, unreal story

" it produces emotions that are hard to reach in China.
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,8,"It's a very common subject, but it produces emotions that are hard to reach in China. The film's portrayal of four key male characters is remarkably successful. The emotions involved in these roles, and the interpretation of human nature by the surrounding dragon sets, make people feel very real. This is a vivid textbook for China. Let speculators like Guo Xiaozi, Deng Chao and articles learn how to make a good film without too many paragraphs, special effects and gimmicks. In terms of shortcomings, Man 1 has a dull expression (as if it was only at the end) and fails to find a new bright spot in the zombie convention."
" One of the best zombie movies every made
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic riff on World War Z, Train To Busan never lets up long enough for you to catch your breath once it gets going. The movie's gore is surprisingly tame, but it's so well placed that you might think it's bloodier than it actually is.At its core, it's actually a beautiful film about a father reconnecting with his daughter after he spends most of his time chasing his career rather than caring for his family. It's exciting, tragic, and often heroic as he fights to get his daughter to safety. I can honestly say it's the first zombie movie that made me both bite my nails AND cry at the same time. It's more action than horror, but when that action is meshed with suspense and horror it's an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride. See it."

",2019-02-18 00:00:00,10,"'Train to Busan' is a thoroughly enjoyable, nail biting, scary, occasionally thought-provoking experience, heart-wrenching, innovative, effective and technically excellent movie. The background score is very effective. The Koreans do know how to make a great movie! MUST WATCH!!"
" Has the look and feel of a B movie, but this zombie movie turns out to be a rather good one. Great frenzy and gore. Riveting suspense and unnerving fight for survival.
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Didnt expect much of it at first. Looked like a cheap B movie, because of the low budget for special effects. But that low budget for special effects turns out to be a good thing, because what we get instead of boring CGI effects is great real life mass pursuits of zombies. And instead of boring CGI we get a lot of real life unnerving close up fights for survival with zombies in a high speed train.Yes, the bloody zombies dont look particularly convincing, but their frenzy is terrific nonetheless. Yes, for those nitpickers who complain about apparent loopholes in the story, there are indeed some, but they dont affect the movie's suspense. The actors arent particularly great either, but their characters are quite convincing nonetheless.Despite all these minor let downs I got really swept away with this suspenseful story about a korean dad, who wants to protect his young daughter from zombie attacks on a train. The ""zombies on a train"" theme is rather interesting as well. All in all a really surprising, enjoyable and even emotionally touching zombie movie. 7 stars, but I will upgrade to 8 stars if this movie still stands strong after a second viewing."
" Collision course with zombies.....and emotions
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,6,"Train to Busan is a decent zombie movie that focusses less on horror/gore, and more on people and emotions. Without a real intro, the watcher is thrown in the middle of the movie, already overrun by zombies, while a group of survivors try to escape by train. But the horrors continu on the train, as it seems that zombies are not the only monsters.The effectiveness of this movie is thanks to the great actors who portray the spastic and quick zombies, without relying on gore. Another effect is the amazing acting by father and daughter, pregnant woman and boyfriend, and the ""evil"" rich man who doesn't care about others. The movie obviously focusses on humanity, choises and effects.That's also the flaw of the movie. After a while it becomes repetitive and the roles become cliche. The ""evil"" rich man becomes a cliche to a point that it becomes caricatural. This doesn't bring the movie down, because the pacing is so fast, that you'll never get bored or stuck in a situation. Train to Busan is still one of the better zombie movies in years."

",2019-02-13 00:00:00,6,"About 2.5 years after the release, I watched this movie. Boy, didn't I confused the high score here.Train to Busan has an original story: how a train survive zombie apocalypse to the end of the road (or in this case, rail). The CGI aren't half bad. The suspense and thrill also keep you on the edge. BUT and this is a really big but, how the characters take decision here is what infuriated me the most. They are - to put it nicely - UTTERLY STUPID.The story started nice and sound. All good until zombie arrived and suddenly all characters decided to be the stupidest person in the world. Yes, I know zombie and any other life-threathening situation will clouding your judgment. But in this movie, it's just unbelievable idiot. I lose interest through the end of the movie but keep watching (though with high blood pressure).Yes, yes there are touching dramas here and there but the drama doesn't need to occurred IF the stupid decision was not taken at the very first place. I want to list them here but there are so many. I just can't."
" A wanna be zombie flick
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,3,"Well well well, I had very high expectations from this one but alas, it turned out to be a over rated zombie flick. The acting was very over and so was the story. The was movie was dragged unnecessarily. Its just a wanna be zombie flick to me."
" Hugely inflated and misleading score
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,4,"With such a hight score of 8, one would think and come with the expectation that it'd be comparable to the likes of Shutter Island in plot, Dark Knight Rises in action and scale, and The Shawshank Redemption in theme, when in reality it was just another brainless rehash of the same plotline of already countless zombie movies that the audience had already seen countless times from the countless releases in recent years...The only new thing this movie had it going is that only this time they were escaping on a train, which was literally a freaking one to one rip off of the anime Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress.... lol?Checking what are written in the reviews you'd find numerous 10/10 ratings (lol?) of fans citing and counting no name Korean actors and actress like the back of their hand praising every thing related, jamming in all kinds of adjectives that you'd think you're reading some thanking letter to stars from fanboys or some sort... Jeez, since when is IMDB so infested with Kpop fans?"

" From start to finish what an awesome film!
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,10,"Never have I seen such an engaging zombie film.Anyone wanting to make a zombie film should watch this for reference, rather than following the tired and overdone ridiculousness of boobs, sex and stupid people acting stupid, making stupid decisions and deserving to die.A very realistic portrayal of human emotion, human actions and scary as any nightmare, this film blows modern day zombie attempts right out of the water.Raw, nerve wracking and even (if you're a softie like me...) tear jerking - the ending will stay with me for a while - this is one movie NOT to be missed if you're looking for a serious undead story that you'll never forget."
" What a overrated flick.
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,3,"That this flick gets 7.5 on IMDB is ridiculous. The people that say ""better than Romero"" have never seen a Zombie movie. Flat story, cheap gory effects (if you can call that gory) and actors fresh from school. Every second is so predictable and the characters are just stereotypes. What a waste of time!"
" snakes on a plane, zombies on the train
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,6,"The 'zombie apocalypse' genre has a long history of packing social commentary alongside the scares. I would even go so far as to say the best movies always have a point they are trying to make. But that being said, you need a light touch or it risks becoming a glorified lecture. To paraphrase Futurama, when you do things right, people won't be sure you did anything at all. Unfortunately, with this movie even the dimmest audience member will know exactly what the movie is doing by the five minute mark because its messaging has all the subtlety of one of its Zeds.But I'm getting ahead of myself. The movie, set in South Korea (dialogue is also Korean so native English speakers like myself will need subtitles), follows the passengers of a train headed to Busan which starts off just as the news starts getting a little weird. This part of the movie is done quite well, with the characters observing emergency vehicles speeding towards distant fires, odd crowds at the train station, and the occasional person running past in a panic without any obvious source for their distress. Things escalate quickly, however, and soon the characters are in the classic survival scenario.The movie follows the perspective of several characters, but the ""main"" character is a young overworked father taking his daughter to see his estranged wife. Exposition scenes inform us that despite the wealth and stature he's achieved as a hedge fund manager, his familial relationships are strained due to his heavy workload. His daughter in particular wastes no opportunity to reject him or badmouth him to strangers for his ""selfishness"".In broad strokes this theme of ""selfishness is bad"" isn't completely foreign to American cinema. In a western film the guy who refuses to stick his neck out for fellow survivors or hordes resources would probably be expected by the audience to face some comeuppance, but the version here is pretty strict. Just having the job of hedge manager earns the scorn of other characters because it made him wealthy, and his own daughter rejects him openly after he attempts to use his influence to keep her safe without also trying to help everyone else. Even his investment strategy earns him a call accusing him of responsibility for the actions of a company in his portfolio.The movie keeps hammering on this point the whole way through. For example, there's also a scene that takes place after the main character has 'learned his lesson' that showcases a whole group of 'selfish' people which ends very predictably. My problem is that after a while it begins to feel contrived, like they are forcing characters to act in ways that aren't logical or reasonable just so they can line up another parable for the audience.Fortunately, a lot of the other aspects of the movie are well done and make up for the weaker elements. The movie is deeply atmospheric and beautifully shot, really conveying the unsettling feeling of a society in full breakdown. Simple things like the conductor communicating with traffic controllers effectively spread unease as the conversations gradually reveal the isolation of the train and its passengers in a world going dark. Dialogue is minimalist but efficient, portraying fear and grief but sprinkling in enough humor to keep it from becoming overbearing. And the main danger, the zombies, are well designed and executed, being scary enough to keep you on edge and utilized for more than simple jump scares.The ending kind of made me sigh, and the little girl wasn't so much cute as grating, but the ending was earned by the story. I would say that as far as these types of movies go, it was fairly original and interesting. Expect to feel a little lectured at but mostly still have a good time."
" Zombie movie
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,9,Nice movie. The plot and acting is awesome and should film 2nd part.
" Totally worth the wait!
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,10,"I've been wanting to see this movie for a while and its was so worth it. This is the only other zombie movie to ever make me cry. Throughout this movie, my anxiety was up but it was totally worth it. I wasn't disappointed. Now its 1:22 AM and I should get some sleep."
" Outstanding
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,9,Horrible.. heart touching.. every potential are present in this movie.. just fantabulous👍👍👍
" Well worth seeking out this South Korean Zombie epic.
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,8,"Train to Busan makes most zombie film look pedestrian in comparison. While you average zombie film moves along like a car stuck on the M25, this movie moves along like a Porsche on high-speed racetrack.
The director throws every thing at the movie including the kitchen sink. Like all great movies you really care about the characters, which makes the hyperactive, never let up ending almost unbearable to watch.
Its 2 half hour running time allows the script to include every plot device seen in most recent zombie movies. But most importantly it never drags. Its claustrophobic setting allows the director to pull off some unique moments of crisis. Also GCI and stunt team do a very good job here.
Highly recommended not just by me but by the director of Sean of the dead no less, how can you go wrong."
" Watch out , THIS IS A B-MOVIE !
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,2,"A movie with childish acting and writing in many points , involves all the cliches of this kind of movies with nothing new. I was mislead by ratings and reviews in IMDB and watched it. If you want quality in cinema you can find it in some zombie movies like the recent ""The cured"" but there is no quality in this one. I was not really thrilled and got bored after first hour. Watchable with pop corn ,friends and laughs if your expectations are low. Obviously overrated and a B-Movie ."
" Best Zombie movie ever made!
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,10,"This movie surpassed any zombie movie I have ever seen made in the US. It often had me at the edge of my seat, with my eyes wide and glued to the screen. It encompassed suspense, drama, character development, humor and several teary moments. It was so fast paced and action packed, having to read the subtitles did not take away or distract from the movie at all. A must-see... I highly recommend!"
" The best modern Korean movie !
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,10,"In Korea ,the virus was dangerous...the korean population was infected by this virus ,so dangerous !
In my opinion , Train to Busan is beautiful and captivating movie.
The score is very emotional,I cry during this movie because the score was very important in this movie ,and emotional for my ears !
I think,this cast was a very good choice! Yoo-Gong is very charismatic and he played very good in general.
If you like or love the action movie,you should see Train to Busan !"
" A solid PG-13 foreign zombie flick
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,8,"If you're looking for a solid PG-13 foreign zombie flick, Train to Busan is a great choice. It drags a bit at the beginning, but the undead are quick and horrifying, and the story keeps your adrenaline pumping once it gets going. It's not overly gory, either. This movie relies on the hopelessness of the situation to frighten you. I'd happily add this to my collection of zombie movies."
" 9 stars
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,9,"I have to deduct one start from this excellent zombie movie.
Only because i don't know why they cannot wait until night to make the move, when zombies cannot see and they can throw rocks to make sounds to distract the ones that come their way :)"
" Good acting and intense zombie thriller

" Great zombie movie
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,9,"The zombies we're average like, but the story was pretty unpredictable, which makes you to stay stiff on your couch. Well done!"
" Highly Overrated
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,4,Suffers from so many plot holes and inconsistencies.
" Really well done
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,10,"I'm a huge fan of 80's B-horror movies with lots of cheesy gore in it and this movie is nothing like that. This is actually a good movie. The story is nice and touching, there's a lot of suspense, the quality is nice and it's aesthetically appealing to watch. It's just a nice film that's beautifully brought."
" Korean Zombie
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,10,We all love Zombie movies but once again Korea brings a fresh take on a stake genre. This movie is non stop action and all the character s resemble society. These aren't your slow rolling Zombies but sprinters who want a pi e of the action. Take this train.
" Funny
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,1,Ordinary passengers were beating zombies with their bare hands to move in the train. I've never seen such a ridiculous zombie movie in my life.
" Fair acting and plot degenerate faster than the Zombies
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,3,"What starts off as something interesting quickly descends into just another zombie movie, where the zombies move fast and the plague turns people into zombies faster. So one chomp and evidently the zombies aren't hungry for you any more as you are one of them. Makes you wonder what all the fuss is about since all you seem to have to do is tape their mouths shut or stuff a sock into it.Virus outbreak zombie movies seem to fall into 2 camps, those with slow moving zombies and those with olympic sprinters. These are the latter. Despite epic levels of speed, they are blind in the ""just dark enough"" passages. Again, makes you think all you have to do is wait for dark, I mean dusk, and duct tape them all, threat neutralized.I was willing to look over all of these shortcomings because you do find yourself caring about most of the characters presented. But then came the last 20 minutes where it was just so overdone and stupid that I had to write a review saying so. The ending is overly dramatic and totally predictable and immensely underwhelming. It really makes the previous time spent watching the film feel as totally wasted. Despite the high praise of many reviewers, I cannot echo those sentiments and think there are much better zombie movie alternatives out there."
" Hands down EPIC!!!
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,10,One of my top zombie movies. The action doesn't stop in this movie but it has a sense of realism due to the phenomenal acting by the cast.
" Molecule Review: Train to Busan (6 Stars)
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,6,"Just like any other zombie film, Sang-ho Yeon's Train to Busan starts and ends like you would expect it to be unless you deep dive into the dialogues between the characters that create a much more emotional impact on you. There's a biomedical threat engulfing the city of Seoul and its neighboring areas when a selfish fund manager has to take his daughter to her mom (they are separated) in Busan. But they don't know what's coming to hunt them. How these two characters plus a bunch of other ones try to save themselves from the impulsive zombies forms the crux of this horror thriller that has some insane CGI work to keep you hooked. I watched the Hindi dubbed version (with English subtitles), so naturally the effect was a bit low if you are not a Korean native. But I found Train to Busan to be an emotional drama about relationships and their absence more than it is about a zombie apocalypse. You have to decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing. TN."
" a horror film and a drama in one package
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,10,"Actually a very good one in both categories. Korean cinema has given some very good movies in the past -starting from the excellent ""old boy""- and has already been recognised as an asset in movie industry, so it would be rather foolish to undervalue its films as coming from a country far too remote, far too culturally different, far too unknown to pay some attention to its productions.
I started watching this film with no prejudice but also not been sure of the quality of what i was to watch. Right from the begining it was apparent that it was a serious production and not at all a cheap cartoon style film from a ""third"" country. And so it proved to be till its very end: A very well made zombie/horror film and not at all only. Through the story line and using the zombie issue as an excuse and cause, there was a very clear and interesting effort to point out the contrast of ""good"" and ""evil"" in human nature, and that is among living humans themselves. You add to this the really tender family drama unfolding along a very well and quite realistically made adventure and you have a film which captures your attention from the very beginning and finally leaves you very moved and in tears.
Last but not least: The excellent acting -the little girl will break your heart especially in the final scene- and the amazing, musically simple yet really imposing, epic music score in the ending credits.
Do watch it, worths every penny of it!"
" Can't get better than this
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,8,"I don't usually like zombie movies. I find them mistly funny which is why izombie is in my toplist. This movie however contained everything and was the best partymix possible, i think, for moviegoers with the inclusion of zombies. Well done creators."
" Best Zombie Film EVER...Period
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,10,"Train to Busan ReviewThis was THE BEST zombie flick I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot). It's hyper intense, emotional and heartbreaking all at the same time. I've never seen anything quite like it.I absolutely LOVE how it shows the rapid decline of civilization. One minute people are just normal people. The next minute those same people are leaving children and the elderly for dead just to save their own skin. It's visceral, disturbing and ABSOLUTELY realistic (which is something zombie movies rarely are).The movie is extremely fast paced and rarely takes its foot off of the accelerator. This keeps you on the edge of your seat, and always wondering what's going to happen next.The director did an excellent job at painting a scenario where no one was safe. You feel the same way about the characters too. You really don't have any clue who's going to die next, and that's SO refreshing to me.If you're like me and love all things zombie related then you HAVE to watch this film!"
" A non-zombie-fan's opinion
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,7,I don't typically watch zombie movies and I'll admit to not seeing the beginning (it was playing in the background at a friend's place when I arrived) but we were all pretty much glued to the screen for the remaining 80% of this film and I even getting a little emotional at the end.
" I really cried a lot!
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,10,"I do not really write reviews but I had to write one for this... It's just binds you and keeps you tact till the end and the way everything's so realistic makes it even much better! Aah I watched it with English subtitles still the impact of this movie on me is impeccable!
Hat's off"
" One of the better ""zombie"" movies!
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,8,"I love zombies. I don't love the constant stupid decisions of characters in zombie movies that allow everything to descend into chaos. Train to Busan lacks a lot of the stupid found in most zombie movies while still providing drama, kind emotional moments and terror!The infected are done so well! I've never seen snarling, ratcheting, flesh devouring fiends portrayed with such skin crawling realism.Highly recommended for zombie fans. Do watch in original language with subtitles if you need them."
" The best zombie horror film I've ever watched!
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,10,"Train to Busan is THE best zombie horror film made so far. It's intense, heartbreaking and it'll keep you at the edge of your seats through the second half of the film. If you're into horror films, especially zombie films, do yourself a favour and watch it! It's available on Netflix right now as of November 2018.10/10!"

",2018-10-25 00:00:00,4,"Listen, do yourself a favor and get the EXPRESS PASS on this one.Train to Busan was insanely too long...I live for zombie movies, but this one was putting me to sleep after about an hour. I went and made some tea 🍵, seriously.No real story line here...yeah, zombies, still needs a decent storyline, IMO. The characters are all pretty ridiculous, most notably the Korean, Smash Mouth, ICP, Guy Fieri - looking dude with the pregnant wife.Decent enough acting, pacing, violence, special FX, weird zombie seizures, and plenty of blood.I think they just tried to pack too much in, with a whole lot of nothing going on, on such a short train ride. This is a better luck next time flick for me.Thanks for riding!4/10 🔥🔪🔥🔪"
" Next Stop: Korean Zombies - Worth getting on for
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,8,"I've had a big thing for Korean horror films from the 2000s in particular, but of late have lost touch. I was recommended this movie to sit down and watch, and what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be.Zombie films have been done to the death (no pun intended) over the past decade or two, and there have been some very interesting and enjoyable movies over a number of genres. However, this one sidesteps the problems some others have by having a good director, budget and good cast of actors with a fine script. Avoiding the slapstick, comedy or torture porn route, this is a story about redemption for a father out to protect his daughter and discover the human within. Okay, that's not exactly wholly original (e.g. War of the Worlds etc) but it does have heart and keeps you engrossed.As per the name of the film, the travellers are stuck on a train to Busan from Seoul along with the zombies, and we have action without too much gore/violence, but really tension and emotion as we watch our protagonists try to survive this catastrophe. There are some cliched characters, for example the older selfish rich businessman and the old couple etc, but really you can't change everything. It still works.Granted this doesn't have any social commentary like some that made the zombie genre famous, e.g. the Night of the Living Dead, but in its own way it is a refreshing change on the low budget or comedy-centric comedies that have abounded of late in the field. I really enjoyed it. Bit concerned if they make a sequel, but that will be inevitable. Worth a try."
" If only Ken Loach had directed this....
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,5,"Train to Busan. A zombie film. I hate zombie films but my brother insisted we go and see it as it was not just any old zombie film, it was a KOREAN zombie film AND set on a train, so would pass my pretentious test. It didn't. It was dull. I couldn't stop laughing when I wasn't supposed to. I annoyed my brother with this Ill advised laughter so much he moved away from me. For comedy value alone and the last 20 minutes where there were hardly any zombies and some humanity (the best bit of the film) I'll give it a flesh eating 5 out of ten. Don't let that put you off. I hated 28 days later which was apparently a masterpiece in zombie filmmaking history. That too, was dull. Zombies don't exist, metaphorically or literally. Think Ken Loach needs to direct the next one for some gritty social zombie realism."
" Pale acting, no story
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,6,"Pale acting, no story line.
I don't recommend it for anyone, unless you wanr to kill the time by watching anything.If you are the type of people who criticises the story and acting: run away."
" Better than world war z
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,8,"Wow this movie was fantastic in every way. A perfectly paced zombie flick with amazing characters that you actually feel for and care about as opposed to others in the genre in which you don't care what happens to them. I can't remember when s horror movie made me choke up like that. It could have been bloodier but that's a knit pick of mine. Dose not affect how good this movie is. So please do yourself a favor and check this one out, especially horror fans, you will not be disappointed"
" well produced melodramatic zombiemovie full of action
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,8,"Very good produced zombie movie with supreme camera work.
this film offers a pleasent variety of emotional scenes and very suspensefull action scenes where the passengers try to fight the threat of the zombies and escape the chaos.
main acters and dialoges beneath the chaos are very authentic and well played.
of course this genre doesnt allow a deeper look into the relationsheep of the passengers. nevertheless the sideplot fillins are very well placed. at the beginning of the movie dialoges seem a little exaggerate emotional, but the longer the zombie threat lasts, the more the main family fights its way to the heart of the observer, only possible due to the zombie virus threating there life's.
As good and authentic as the main acters may be, sidecast zombie actors are not authentic and in some scenes one truely can see how the actors have fun playing those zombies. unuasual about this zombie movie is, that the zombies seem to have a fast motion pace, which makes it even harder for the passengers to shake them off. All in all this film leaves a mark due to the very good production and tension, shock moments, and emotional sequences. the storyline could have been a little bit more extended and sideplot dialogues could have been a little bit more lively and longer, wheres the zombies could have been a little bit less lively in my point of view. nevertheless the emotional dialogues and melodramatic sequences this film shows leaves a mark in ones mind and heart and makes this film mezmerizing."
" A Great Action Thriller
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,10,"Train to Busan is a pleasure to watch. It takes the classic pandemic zombie and combines it with the isolated environment of a speeding train to great effect. The pandemic/contagion element is interwoven with ideas of environmentalism and morality. Trapping the characters in an enclosed space with the monster creates tension and conflict in a way that is somewhat reminiscent of a science fiction movie set on a spaceship or an action movie set on a submarine. These elements converge as tensions rise and the movie turns to exploring the darkest, as well as the most selfless, parts of human nature in the way that post-apocalyptic movies seem to do so well.This ideological framework is brought to life by some fantastic acting and great character writing that really draws you into the movie. The cinematography and visual storytelling are exceedingly well done and create a distinctive atmosphere. This is a movie that feels like it was built off of many well crafted details.Train to Busan isn't particularly gorey or terrifying and leans more towards the action/thriller category. It creates intrigue through the failings of the characters and humanity as a whole as well as the hope for redemption. Although the movie becomes a little ""over the top"" towards the end, it doesn't prevent this movie in being 10/10."
" Amazing!
",2018-10-10 00:00:00,10,"You would think the age of zombie flicks has passed, considering the market was saturated with them. But then along came Train to Busan and absolutely wreck havoc (in a good way) in this stale genre.First I would like to praise the director and the crew, considering that they with a very modest budget and insanely short period of time managed to create a fantastic movie!The cast too was absolutely great, where they would portray several archetypes of human behaviour and succeed splendidly!Train to Busan, is an amazing, refreshing, action zombie flick. 
Where the gripping reality and human shame come to light.If you want a good movie I cannot recommend Train to Busan, because it is a GREAT movie!Cheerio,"

",2018-10-02 00:00:00,9,"This film was super well done, but it gave me so much anxiety. Which is intended in this genre, but I feel like it was beyond so. Most of my criticism doesn't have to do with this movie specifically, but in the zombie movie genre as a whole. For example; a pet peeve that is used in this movie is the speed of the zombies and the high turnover time of the infected. It's just straight not fair. Anyway. It's a great movie. I just got a stress headache from anxiety watching it. 👍🏻"

" Could have been great
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,4,"What started as a phenomenal well acted beautifully shot interesting take on a zombie movie starts flatlining at the end with humans doing stupid nonsenseSpoilers:
There are a few scenes where people self sacrifice and I love it. If it's done well and has a purpose. One of the mains gives up his life to hold a door. Cool! makes sense. We all liked that guy now we're sad. 
Then for no reason at all one of the old ladies just hangs out staring at her friend and gets attacked. Umm what?
Want even more dumb? The lady who watches her friend die is like hmmm I wanna die or something. Not really clear but opens up a door to let in a horde of zombies. Why? Who knows. Do you care? Not really. 
A sports guy running with the sports girl go into a train and after spending the whole movie keeping train doors closed behind them, you know: cause zombies, they don't and she gets attacked because jerk guy is alive and screws then over so sports guy could leave since everyone has died and turned and he's like nah let's hug it out. She eats him. 
The rest becomes a tense struggle for survival as the train conductor leaves the train for some reason to help jerk guy. Not sure what his plan was. No weapon and obviously no fighting ability so -dead 
then the ending is so dumb that it boggles my mind someone was like ""green light this baby."" Have the main character fight off jerk guy, who's in the process of changing but wait until he goes full zombie instead of kicking him in the crotch and throwing him off the train. So his solution: oh man you're gonna love this, he comes behind jerk and can grab him anywhere: feet, stomach, arms but no shoves his hand right in his mouth. Because yummy. So he's dead and could have been a reason other than to kill off the cast a few days into shooting for eating into the budget
Then the very end they stop the train in front of creepy tunnel and soldiers on other side about to shoot and stop when they hear the girl singing because why wouldn't you sing in a dark tunnel when you've BEEN CHASED BY ZOMBIES FOR 2 HOURS AND CANT SEE $HHT???"
" Great movie
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,9,"There was not one minute I didn't enjoyed watching this movie. The writers did not waste a second on this. From beginning to ending the plot was very well packed with climax after climax.The movie started off a bit clichè with a single divorced parent and a daughter he cannot spend enough time with because of his work and busy schedule. It's a very good plot to see their relationship develop through the movie though. Which by the way was a success.The important part of this movie which makes it so unique is the fact that this movie does not, ironically, focus on the zombies. Their origin, cure, strength is not the main focus and will not be explained. What the movie actually represents (and this is my own interpretation) is the interaction within a group of people (representing a society). This movie shows how people react to a 'threat' emotionally, morally and by action. Zombies are just supposed to represent a threat in this movie but still be a tool to make it an action-packed horror movie on the way.Most of the movie take place in a train and creates an original and claustrophobic atmosphere for a zombie movie. The story was pretty close to a real life experience with no really weapons involved or ordinary humans who turn out to know everything about the zombies and fight them as if it was originally their job. Their were a few minor things in the movie that didn't seem to make much sense though.The main character was not that likable in the beginning. Towards the end he started to grow on me. His daughter, thank god, did not turn out to be a clingy annoying daughter. She was suspiciously calm during the whole process of surviving. The husband of the pregnant women was probably my favorit character as for the baseball boy who was quite likable as well. Very colorful characters. The villain a little exaggerated in my opinion but acceptable if you think about the fact that he is supposed to represent the ignorant part of todays society.I spent two hours on a great zombie movie and would recommend it to everybody."
" Must watch
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,10,I cried a lot at the end go for it not that scary.Watch it without any second thought. Just watch it you are missing some quality stuff acting is great everything is over the top love it
" A Ferocious Bite Of Living Dead Excellency
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,10,"I had this movie sitting on my ""YouView"" box for quite a few months, even though I had been originally excited that Film4 had decided to air this ""little"" Korean gem of a horror movie. There had been rave reviews and more than a slight ""buzz"" about the picture. The trouble with me is that I've been let down by hyped movies before - The Blair Witch Project, a major case by example. Another trouble is my own little foibles. I don't want to be reading subtitles when I'm tired (and I do so love to watch horror flicks after the sun has set with the lights low... or off!) and I cannot stand dubbed films (too many Jackie Chan movies in my youth...). So one night, not so very long ago I was feeling awake enough to read a movie so I hit play on ""Train To Busan""...By the time the end credits rolled I was amped up and wide awake. This is one hell of a rollercoaster ride of a movie and one hell of a tangle of modern-day lives story. This is not your basic Zombie flick.You start out really slowly and pretty sedated. A farmer is on his way to the market when his van is stopped by men in hazmat suits. These tell him that there's nothing to worry about. There has been a slight leak at a chemical plant. After quickly decontaminating his vehicle they send him on his way... unluckily for the dear he runs down and kills. More angry at damaging his van than killing a dear he drives away leaving the carcass in the road... yeah... you know what's going to happen. Sure enough, the dead animal thrashes about and shakily gets to its feet... with a dead look in its eyes...Even though this section only takes a few minutes it's one of the most superbly shot sequences I've seen in a movie. The director Yeon Sang Ho manipulates each set perfectly give the audience a creepily eerie atmosphere, which did start the shivers running up and down my spine. For that I thank them... it's been a long time since that's happened. There's nice steady sweeping camera pans. Effortlessly worked lighting. Superb control of sound... or lack of it. Even better is that all of this artwork and skill doesn't stop here it runs throughout the whole movie. It screams skill and class.Then the writers, Park Joo Suk and Yeon Sang Ho, get to work weaving together tales of modern-day living. The main characters are Seok-Woo (Gong Yoo) and his daughter Soo-Ann (Kim Su An). He is a busy, work-comes-first-to-support-family guy who was already lost his wife to divorce and is now bringing up Soo-Ann, with the help of his mother. Soo-Ann is a young child who doesn't understand or appreciate her father's outlook on life. All she knows is that she doesn't see either him or her mother as much as she wants or should. She wants more time with both of her parents. So, on her birthday, after her dad buys her a repeat present (who doesn't need two Nintendo Wii's(?)) she gets him to promise to take her to see her mum for her real present. As is the usual case it's Su-An Kim's performance that steals the show - and this is as it should be.This then brings them into contact with Sang-Hwa (Ma Dong Seok) and his very expectant wife Seong-Kyeong (Jung Yu Mi). Sang-Hwa and Seok-Woo do not get on at all and it's this juxtaposition in ideals and prerogatives that add more depth to the story; especially when they have to work together to survive the train ride. It's Seong-Kyeong that provides the glue to their relationship.Add to this a mysterious homeless man (Choi Gwi Hwa), a couple of romantic teens getting to grips with their feelings towards each other - Yong-Guk (Choi Woo Sic) and Jin-Hee (Sohee), and officious self-centred train manager Yon-Suk (Kim Eui Sung), you have a set of characters which can create some volatile or sentimental storylines... and this is before we get to the best Zombies... EVER!One of my favourite zombie flicks is Return Of The Living Dead. Two of the reasons were the zombies - they were dead and very icky (most were skinless)... and they were fast. The brain-eating buggers didn't shamble after you. And you have the same here. Though these dead aren't so skinless they are damned fast and furious.This adds to some pretty spectacular action scenes in the movie which Yuen Sang Ho directs magnificently. But, whereas, most directors would opt for action over horror and story Yuen is proficient in all styles. The scenes where the dead reanimate are both startling, invigorating, eerie, and full of style and strength.This is a tour-de-force of filmmaking, let alone horror filmmaking. Everything in this movie is excellent, from the story to the acting to the directing."
" Haunting and breathtaking.
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,8,"Both emotional and terrifying, it is the best zombie film I've ever seen."
" An excellent zombie movie
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,9,"A wonderful movie matching Hollywood standards. A movie bringing out love, betrayal, selfishness as a group of people struggle to live along a gang of zombies in a moving train. Wish few more characters got saved at the end. Nevertheless a thrilling movie journey"
" Tensed, brutal/gory n very engaging. This is how zombie genre shud be.
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,10,"I am writing this review again.
I don't know how n y my earlier review of this film got deleted. I am a big fan of Korean thrillers n a bit bias but this film doesn't deserve anything below 9 from horror n thriller fans.I find movies set in a running train intriguing.
The aerial scenes were very well shot. The cinematography is spectacular n the editing crispy.
The film is loaded with tension n mayhem throughout.
The best character is the husband of the pregnant woman. One helluva selfless fella.Horror, especially zombie fans will not b disappointed."
" Su-an Kim is wonderful!
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,10,"Didn't want to watch due to having to follow sub titles, but sooo glad I gave in. They had all the zombies I could want and more, but I really liked how they looked and acted, not typical. Liked the movie but loved Su-an Kim. What a performance! She really played it well and gut wrenching at the end. I felt her pain."
" WOW WOW WOW
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,10,"I'd just like to say I don't normally write reviews BUT THIS FILM WAS WOW WOW WOW. I was skeptical watching my first foreign film with English subtitles and a zombie film (as they're usually done pretty bad) but WOW was I wrong. Time after time I was gasping, crying, cheering, scared and most of all on WOW'ing the whole time! I just wish more of the western countries knew about this film as Korean acting, storyline building, character development honestly everything was just WOW. One thing I will fault is the CGI... but bring on the sequel I'm ready for it to WOW my mind!"
" Top tier
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,9,"I've seen my fair share of zombie flicks and this one's up there with the greats, easily. 
The zombies in the this movie's are so brutal and portrayed in such a unique way. It never gets boring. Not for a moment. (Some damn good pacing)
The acting from the entire ensemble is on point. Totally sold me on their performance.
There was some moments where the lead characters had to make some pretty difficult choices. That kinda thing always happens in a zombie film, but they dealt with it a fresh way and me care for these characters even more.
The best thing about the movie's the hordes and hordes of zombies! And when talking about a zombie movie, it feels so refreshing to say that. (I wonder how many extras it took to get that many zombies)I also want to mention something which is so important to me in a horror movie: Subtlety.
There were scenes where zombies or the infected would just hang around in the back of the screen, sometimes not even in focus and the camera would just glance over it. That makes it so much more real and scary. It's nail biting from start to finish and completely worth your time. Go for it!
And just when I thought this genre had finally gone stale...
Train to Busan is currently Korea's 9th top grossing domestic movie of all time and I can definitely see why!
What a movie."
" Brilliant...Zombie lovers will surely love this.
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,10,This movie is far better than many Hollywood zombie apocalyptic movies.
" One of the best zombie movies of all time! IDC! IDC
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,10,"It's been a while since I've seen a really good movie and a really good zombie movie at that. But Train to Busan is LIIIIIIIT!!! I was exhausted by the end of this movie. Everytime you though you catch a little break, BAM! Something else goes wrong. It was a never ending thrill ride! If you are looking for something truly entertaining to watch, this movie is it!"
" Zombies on a train
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,7,"First we had snakes on a plane, now Korean zombies on a train. Awesome.
Korean cinema is a curious beast; I love the films of Park Chan-Wook, but other contributors have a tendency to get a bit mawkish and oversentimental as the drama unfolds, and I'm afraid that what was otherwise a beautifully paced and entertaining ZOMBIE film ended up this way. I'm all for character development, and being made to care a bit who lives and who dies, but....IT'S A ZOMBIE FILM! It starts out tongue-in-cheek, with some genuinely squirmy horror vibes, and I think it would've been best if it managed that balance throughout, but it lost its way tonally a bit in the last 20 minutes.
Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of it, and it will linger in my memory of top zombie films."
" A surprisingly touching horror film loaded with gripping suspense and intense action scenes
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,8,"Some of my favourites are 28 Days Later, Zombieland, and A Girl with all the gifts: I prefer memorable characters, action scenes, dialogues, introspection about humanity, suspense, and dark humour over gory jump scares.This movie, albeit predictable plot lines and character stereotypes, the actors and pace engage the viewer to root for their (good & ill) fates. Characters' actions mostly remained convincing: their behaviour is driven by consistent, reasonable motive, and some characters transformed through meaningful incidents naturally, not in a sudden to fit the ending. Each survivor is well acted.Camera work was effective in portraying a sense of dread and chaos, while keeping focus on the main characters and plots moving along the train corridors. At 2 hours in length, there wasn't much dragging scenes at all. I just skipped the character intro (10 minutes), and from then on, the story runs along. How realistic is the ending depends on the viewer: are you an optomist or a pessimist? Either way, it's 2 hours well spent.The 15 minute behind the scenes bonus feature actors and production crew rehearsing, teasing each other, including bloopers, quite a strange shift in mood :)"
" wowie
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,9,"Im not a crying guy, but this movie got me real close to it a lot of times. on the first time watching i'd missed the first half hour but i still felt like i knew the characters. i was screaming ""you idiot"" throughout, but i could still understand the motives. This is just a really good movie."
" Amazing
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,10,Anything below 8/10 is a think an injustice to what is an all-round amazing movie with incredible action.
" Unbelievable. No words.
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,10,Incredible from beginning to end. That young girl is without a doubt one of the best child actors I've ever come across. Everyone was brilliant.
" Powerful zombie movie with a heart
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,9,"South Korean cinema is so good. This movie is part 28 days later, part Snowpiercer and another part The Cassandra crossing. But it still manages to be very original. The morality tale is strong, and we see a transformation of corporate self centered father into a self sacrificing hero. The movie disproves his early maxim that everyone should look for themselves in no uncertain terms. The selfish coward corporate train manager and his refusal to help others is given its due. And in the end, humanity wins in the perfect if hopeful ending. Movie is fun, fresh and still manages to be a good zombie/outbreak movie showing end of the world of sorts, in a way much higher budget Hollywood crapies can only dream to achieve. Kudos, South Korea!"
" The best zombie movie of all time
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,10,This movie is unlike any other. I know you're probably saying this sounds generic like any other review I've read but let me change your mind. I'm an advid movie viewer and I haven't seen something so intense yet breathtaking in a horror film such as this one. From starting off seeming generic to completely throwing you off and taking you on a journey you didn't expect. It's breathtaking art work and character performance captures the essence of the viewer and delivers something emotionally engaging that rarely comes from movies especially a horror movie. Please give this movie a chance because it's definitely worth a watch.
" Zombie Drama
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,8,"This review is for people like me who have put off watching this film for a while. Zombie movies are not my thing.Luckily I bit the bullet, as this is a excellent character film. It is 2 hours of touching moments or upsetting behaviour. The film shows the best and worst of people, which is often true in crisis.The movie is unfortunately hindered by a few cliches towards the end, perhaps because it was made to be a success at the Box office. Only small directing choices that I feel would be better removed. Character behaving same way three times in around five minutes. A Flashback and what I assume was meant as a 3D moment.So if, you have been putting off watching this, in fear of just another Zombie movie. Or you love Zombie movies. I hope that you give it a chance as it is well worth a watch."
" one of the best of the Z genre
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,8,"On par with the greatest Z films is this superb corean effort which mix zombie horror and suspense with great human drama and character development.
 if u like zombie films......serious above average zombie films then this movie is for you.
 it could be better here and there especially in the 2nd part of the movie which was somehow repetitive but overall this is close to perfection and it stands high with classics like the romero series the 28 days later series and others like the walking dead series.
 I give this 8 out of 10 easily and I will add it to my collection when it will be released."
" Masterpiece
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,9,"It certainly has some flaws and leaves certain things unexplained; that being said, watching this movie is a really artistic experience.
The setting is terrifying and brutally realistic; the pacing is fast but not rushed, and the acting is excellent. One of the best films of the genre I've seen in a while, highly recommend it."
" Glad I gave it a go
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,10,I nearly turned it off at the beginning due to it being subtitled as I am not a great lover of foreign movies. I am so glad I didn't. Best Zombie movie I have seen in a long time and I have seen a lot! The story line was really good which I didn't expect as most of the action is limited to a train. The acting was believable. I didn't like the Sang-hwa character at first but he grew on me. I found myself caring for the characters and wanting them to survive this apocolypse. Well done to all the cast and crew for giving us a great train ride of a movie.
" Being picky...
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,2,"The writers had a reasonable idea, but unfortunately have no idea how an actual 21st century modern railway works!Things that I didn't know;
Trains are like buses and can be routed on a whim without the need for Signalling or Signalers/dispatchers to control movements.Under a zombie attack railways will still function at 100%, including signalling, the electrical supply to the trains, signals and turnouts.Mobile phone networks will still work and not get overwhelmed, and handset batteries last for hours without chargeOn the modern railway, the car lights go out in tunnels to give protagonists a chanceZombies can be stopped by unlockable sliding doors between cars.Some elder Korean women only look about 35 years old women with wigs onWhen a track is blocked, you can just take any from any yard or track and go where you want regardless of what the signalling dictates.You can easily run and jump onto a runaway loco that's traveling in excess of 20MPH whilst carrying a child and if you're pregnantNever trust the middle aged business executive, he'll just sacrifice everyone else to survive simply to get infected later"
" This movie represents modern korean film industry
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,10,"If you are eagerly finding some of the best zombie movies than its worth watching for you. amazing pace with extraordinary acting & twist. everyone did brilliant job. you can't differentiate between a hollywood movie & this one. technically this is better than as usual hollywood zombie movies. watch it, i guarantee you won't regret."
" Awesome Zombie movie!
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,9,"Fantastic zombie movie, all the way from South Korea! This movie is great! Starts out like a normal day, father/daughter trip to visit the mother (the parents are temporary separated) and suddenly the world comes crashing down town by town. And these aren't you slow walking bizzaro zombies, these babies can run.....FAST!! This movie kept me on the edge of my seat! Who would be infected next? Who would survive? Also, the little girl is adorable!! 
This movie is in Korean, so there are subtitles, but with everything going on in the movie, you quickly get past that and can't wait to see what happens next!"
" A bloody tragedy
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,7,"When a diverse group of citizens board a train the moment the apocalypse begins, lines between decency and survival quickly blur beyond recognition. Train to Busan may have all the hallmarks of classic zombie flicks, but its clear execution and vicious monsters keep it entertaining along with a handful of gruesomely memorable scenes."
" Brilliant
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,10,"Think you're in for a rehash of a watered down genre? Think again. Movies and shows this well written, acted and directed are the reason I can hardly watch anything western anymore. Really I can't think of anything done wrong or that could have been done better."
" Worth waiting for
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,10,"I have wanted to see this film for ages,I finally got to see it last night,it was even better than I hoped for,I now want to see the prequel Seoul Station,I hope it's as good as This was"
" Spectacular!!
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,10,"This is the best zombie film I've seen. The effects are incredible and the acting great, too - especially Su-an Kim (who was also fantastic in Battleship Island). The film is insanely suspenseful at times as we follow a divorced father and his daughter trying to escape the zombie apocalypse. Unlike most zombie films, this film has depth and emotion, and beautiful music, too."
" Unorigianal, but entertaining South Korean zombie movie
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,7,"The highest grossing film in South Korea of all time is a routine, but well made zombie thriller. The story begins at the outset of a zombie outbreak with a father and daughter finding themselves on a train to the town of Busan, hoping to escape the zombie plague around them. Unfortunately, the train has a number of folks who are slowly turning intro zombies, so the survivors aboard the train find themselves having to fight their way through the infected cars to get to the safe ones. This story may sound similar to ""Snowpiercer,"" but ""Train to Busan"" lacks that film's smart political subtext. ""Train to Busan"" is simply trying to entertain and it does quiet successfully achieve that with tons of fast zombie action, some interesting set pieces, and solid special effects, which is all fine and good if you're into zombie movies. On the downside, I'm not a fan of fast zombies and prefer the slow lumbering Romero-zombies, just as I also prefer my zombie films to have a Romero-style political subtext. So overall, ""Train to Busan"" manages to come up with some interesting situations and set pieces and does them well, it's all pretty vapid and you'll forget most of the film an hour after you've watched it."
" Scary and clever.
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,7,"I thought it was good. I usually don't like zombie movies because their stupid, but this was a good one. This one character was stupid where he selfishly threw other people to the zombies so he can escape even though he turned into one after falling on the tracks. I also think that the father of the girl should have just thrown him off the train instead of being so kind to him and then get bitten on the hand. He should've survived with his daughter."
" Too Much Drama!
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,1,"Characters are overly dramatic, they're seriously not being realistic. Like seriously, the main guy is clumsy and fights zombies like chicken. Why the hell hold the zombie by the neck or close to the mouth (that's obviously suicide!) when you can kick him off the train while he was talking and not completely turning yet? Why listen to a damn speech of an obnoxious turning man when you could have kicked him off from the train?!?!? But no, they're minds are too melodramatic that they waited for that man to completely turn and bite that stupid main character for the sake of ridiculous drama!"
" A hope for the Korean cinema and an alarm that it can be distinctive in the world wide cinema.
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,7,"Train To Busan ended the contempt of the Zombie in Hollywood. considering the difficulties that this movie saw to be made, It is very well made with the limited production. The story focused on the father and daughter relation that we moved with through the story. The movie however couldn't make the story more solid where there are some scenes that played very important turns in the plot that was based on coincidence and Exaggerated action by the heroes that made the situation worse and worse but I have to say it most of the movie was very entertaining and made my on the edge of my seat and a lot more was sensible. The bad character I found it overrated and over performed. Gong Yoo Soo-an as The father and as the daughter did a great job in their roles and their relation was the warm part of the movie. I take my hat off to all who worked to bring out this picture and the director Yeon Sang-ho ."
" Best Zombie Movie
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,9,"This movie has everything! Zombies, action, ALL OF THE FEELS! It's a must watch for sure and the acting is awesome!"
" Zombie film with emotion.
",2018-06-20 00:00:00,10,"Nominated for 33 awards (winning 9 so far), this is the best zombie film I've seen. The effects are incredible and the acting great, too - especially Su-an Kim (who was also fantastic in Battleship Island). The film is insanely suspenseful at times as we follow a divorced father and his daughter trying to escape the zombie apocalypse. Unlike most zombie films, this film has depth and emotion, and beautiful music, too."
" So I've never been the biggest fan of zombie films so I decided to give them another chance and look up some of the ""best"" of them online.
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,8,"Seok-woo (played by Gong Yoo) is a divorced fund manager who tries to have a relationship with his estranged daughter. Due to his workaholic nature he rarely sees and talks to his daughter so when she asks him to go to Busan to visit her mother for her birthday he reluctantly accepts. They board the train and depart. However right before the train sets off a strange looking woman enters it seemingly running away from something and with a bite wound on her leg. We soon see that she has been infected with something and she starts attacking the train attendant. After that chaos ensues and we see the people that have not been infected try to move to the front of the bus to evade the zombies. We are introduced to Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, a high school baseball team, the person we will all love to hate Yon-suk, two elderly sisters In-gil and Jon-gil nd and homeless man.My favorite character was definitely Sang-hwa. I absolutely loved him as a character and he was the type of character that you would love as a person and not just a fictional character. The main character was not as interesting for me but it was really enjoyable watching him turn into a totally different character and grow throughout the movie. The acting overall was great and the actors really made for feel worried for them especially the little girl.As someone who usually dislikes zombie films this movie really surprised me in the best way possible. The story and cinematography were amazing, the pacing was done perfectly and the setting was the ideal place for this kind of movie. It really brought out the feeling of claustrophobia and hopelessness as the people were just one door away from a horde of zombies. The drama in the movie was also very good and watching the people deal with the situation as well as deal with themselves was very entertaining.If I had to point out the things I disliked about the film it would probably be the cliches. There were a few cliche characters that you would expect in a movie like this which were annoying at parts. There were also a few plot points which I disliked that seemed to be only there to make you feel a certain way about certain events and characters.Still the movie was far, far more enjoyable than I expected and I am very glad that I decided to watch it. Check it out for yourselves and let me know if you enjoyed it as much as I did."
" Loved it!
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,10,"Train to Busan is an exceptional foreign film. Thrilling from start to finish with a little comedy and heart as well.I'm not one who looks to watch zombie flicks and this may be the first Korean film I've ever seen and I loved it. The pacing's non-stop and the emotional stuff isn't too much. How many people died because of that Yon-suk a-hole, he's hilarious. It's also about a man's journey in Seok-woo, becoming heroic and selfless, after witnessing those around him and his daughter in particular care for the welfare of others in a time of peril."
" I seldom rate a movie 10, but this movie deserves no less
",2018-06-01 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely FANTASTIC movie. Not a second wasted. 
It's dramatic, energetic, has great engaging characters, and very moving!
Beautiful shoots, wonderful acting, a plot that swallowed me whole.
I cannot speak enough praises for this title! I doubt I have seen a movie before that would be so flawless in my eyes."
" Way better than George A Romero films
",2018-05-28 00:00:00,10,"This is just way better than any George A Romero films hands down. Top class acting, believable situations, true character development, and none of that cliche gutter comedy to break the immersion. It's just so surprising that Koreans can do this kind of film way better than the famous Hollywood."
" Simply put; An irrefutably all around exceptional movie
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,9,"With a dynamic storyline and multi-dimensional characters, backed by a cast of exemplary actors, its simply myopic to try and place this movie in any one genre.Brimming with elements of Adventure, Romance, Drama, Action, Thriller and ofcourse, from an objective stand point, Horror (of an unprecendented caliber) this movie has scared me, teared me and tore me up all whilst making me overwhelmingly happy.Though admittedly falling victim to a number of banal genre clichés.. like characters freezing at the most irrational, inopportune times and predictable 'zombie-morphings'... this film has done well to redeem itself and atone for shortcomings of zombie movies before.Without revealing too much, i would especially like to commend the screenwriters for such stellar work on scripting the characters and how interactive they were made. The main protoganist took me on a roller coaster ride of emotions... I found my self being inadvertently swept from abhorring everything that he was to adoring everthing that he had become... and his daughter.. my oh my... an adorable charming angel yes.. but an exceptionally gifted actor indeed... THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE... no matter what you may be in the mood for.. im positive you'll find that this movie will adequately satiate ur crave.A+"
" Watch this!
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,10,"Honestly the first time I wanted to watch it, I only watched 10 minutes of it and then I was bored, however I had seen so many good reviews so I decided to give it a try and so I did. WOW this movie made me cry and scream lol I really felt like I was there, I honestly love it and totally recommend it."
" All aboard and feel free to move about the cabin
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,9,"Loved it. I saw a YouTube video about hidden gems on Netflix and they recommended this. I am pretty sick of zombie movies (actually I'm very sick of them) but we were bored, nothing else was on and we decided to watch this. The pace is perfect, the acting was so very natural and the horror seems genuine. Actress Su-an Kim was amazing as the young girl traveling with her father. There are several strong performances in this and it makes all the difference. There are no dull moments as it the story moves from interesting to threatening to full out nightmare.You really get pulled into the situation with these people because as I said, the acting is so natural that you feel you've gotten to know a little bit about these people in the short amount of time they are on the screen. My wife never watches horror / zombie movies but this hooked her immediately. There's just something about it that's a cut above most. Not sure if the other reviews contain spoilers or not but I was glad that I knew nothing about the plot other than it involves people , zombie types and a train. Watch it , I can't imagine a horror fan not thoroughly enjoying this . A pleasant (not quite the right word) surprise."
" A Fresh Zombie Film
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,8,"I didn't know what to expect from a Korean film taking on the zombie genre, a genre that I'd only ever seen from American directors and studios. I really enjoyed this film. It was a very dense film in that there was a tension, emotion, intent, and forward movement at every moment in the film. There was not really any down time, which is what I'm looking for in a thriller. I really liked the lead actor and empathized with him throughout and consider this a film worth seeing even if you're not necessarily a fan of American zombie productions."
" Great character development, may have you sobbing.
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,10,"I'm not that into Zombie flicks, but I really liked this one. Aside from the zombie grappling action scenes which were pretty cliched, the truly compelling characters and the interactions between them is what makes this film a 10 for me.
The fractured relationship between the overworked 'arsehole' dad and his despondent daughter as he begrudgingly escorts her on the train to Busan so she could see her mother on her birthday, the two old ladies who have clearly been close friends for life, the true arsehole of the film who's only interest is his personal wellbeing, the possibly schizophrenic tramp, who people look upon as undesirable but grows in character and regard as the film progresses, and many others. But the star of this film is the little girl who is so expressive her story is written on her face and through the body language she has with her father and the people she meets on the train. 
 This film is pretty cheesy on the face of it, I mean what would you expect from a Korean zombie film. But It goes without saying such well developed characters in such a desperate situation lays bare in the most explicit way, human nature, the good and the bad. And some scenes will have even the most hardened hearts having to fight off a tear or two."
" One of the best zombie movies of recent years.
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,8,"'Train To Busan (2016)' is one of the best zombie movies of recent years, boasting a frenetic energy and the ability to create pulse-pounding tension thanks to an astute focus on fast-paced yet clear action sequences that feature several well-developed characters. Almost all of the primary passengers feel tangible and their relationships are expertly explored, leading to some truly emotional moments as well as constant audience attachment. This is what really elevates the piece above others in the genre. 8/10"
" All a Horde the Train to Busan
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,9,"I had seen the trailer for this and had high hopes but wasn't expecting to be blown away by this. 
I don't mind foreign films and coping with subtitles as there are a lot of foreign gems out there of which this is one. 
On the whole after watching it I felt this was set at the same time as World War Z, just from a South Korean point of view. 
The action was well placed and kept you going confined on the tight space of a train it felt claustrophobic and again reminded me of the zombie outbreak on the plane in WWZ.
The one scene that got me was the little girl singing Aloha Oe such a lovely song anyway but her singing it and crying after what she'd been through....just wow"
" Above and beyond
",2018-05-10 00:00:00,9,"One of the best zombie flicks I've seen. The characters were good and the acting was amazing. Character development was on point. I really felt emotional during certain parts. Zombie actors were outstanding. The special effects and cinematography were amazing also. Storyline was pretty good, I didn't find a slow spot in the movie. If you don't mind reading subtitles, I would highly recommend it to anyone."
" 5 STARS HANDS DOWN
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,10,"I've seen this movie 6 times and never get tired of it. 
I recommend it to anyone"
" Everything you want in a zombie thriller.
",2018-05-04 00:00:00,8,"Train to Busan isn't your ordinary zombie flick. These zombies don't move like they have 2 broken legs and no sense of direction. In fact, these things only get faster and meaner when they turn. Oh and it only takes a few seconds for a human to turn once they've been infected. Making getting bit that much worse for those surrounding you. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Action, gore, and a great story. I also liked the fact that there is no guns for people to use against the zombies. Making it so people have to get creative on how they defend themselves and take them out. So sit back and enjoy the chaos!"
" For those who haven't had a chance to check this gem out. WATCH IT
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,8,"First, We're going to need to do something drastic. Get out your scissors. No, not your real scissors; abstract scissors, scissors of the mind. Imagine all of your preconceived opinions about this blood-filled zombie flick. Snip Snip. Forget them. This movie is chalk full of creativity, colourful character setups and fist-pumping zombie fighting action. Not to mention a few heart pumping scenes where a wrong step could mean instant lunch for a hungry pack of flesh eaters.The ordinary people thrust into a claustrophobic zombie train scenario was fantastic and lead to some very tense moments I never thought I would see in a zombie film. And seriously, just imagine that horrifying scenario. Being stuck in the zombie-infested passenger car of a train going 100+ miles per hour. Throw that train safety video out the window because nothing could ever prepare you for this mess.Fantastic performances with a few exceptions, surprisingly good cinematography and Korean melodrama fit for a zombie apocalypse. The good outweighs the bad here and that's all I can really ask for in a Korean zombie film because it means their is a potential for more.8/10 zombie thumbs up"
" Just another Zombie movie
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,2,"Don't know what the hype is about? It's just another zombie movie with zombies running amok. Probably the 2 differences that one could be excited by are
1) The zombies run fast
2) The movie is in Korean
Apart from these 2 distinct features I couldn't find one part which stood out as a feature that would make me recommend this to anyone. *SPOILER AHEAD*
They just show the infection (which starts randomly) and shows survival (which is mostly running/hiding).
That's it. Nothing more nothing less."
" Get on Board because you're in for a Ride!
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,10,"This is a must see for zombie enthusiasts - what a ride! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. First off, the characters are colorful, yet easy to relate to. I would say the supporting characters are some of the best and well written characters I've seen in a horror genre...ever. I was pleased to see there was a lot of attention to detail on each and every character. The location is unique (98% of the film is shot on a moving train) and it really adds to the high stakes, fast paced, high stress environment. I thought they did a great job creating a space and environment that really added to the story in many layers. It was thematic, metaphorical, helped pace out the film, and overall it was a great visual. This is a must watch."
" Best Zombie Film in the last 15 years
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,10,"I'd put World War Z up there somewhere and Dawn of the Dead 2004 and a few (very few) others in a top 10This had a ""plausible"" reason for the outbreak, and while I am not sure how it traveled so fast so quickly considering it didn't take more than 10 mins tops for those bitten etc to turn I'll let that slide. It had drama, GREAT ZOMBIES (fast, strong/crazy and jumping and all over the place) it had a realistic progression on the train and through out the movie, You had your villain/extra afraid/ahole in the group of survivors, your family groups and your lovers groups, and you feel emotion several times in this movieBack to the villain I watch horror, slasher and action/drama/hero movies and I can honestly say THIS villain made me want to jump through the TV and beat his A-again it takes you through a lot of emotionsthe pace of the movies is quick, we know in the first 3 mins of the film it's a ZOMBIE move, and in the next 12 mins the full action starts and DOES NOT STOPFrankly having this happen in a cramped train with limited options (yet the movies still giving you lots of surprises) was excellent.Really really great movie one of the few I've bought online instead of renting. I'll be watching this several times a year when I have my Zombie weekends."
" LOLOLOL
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,1,"This movie is SO heavily overrated, I can't even fathom why. If you want to watch a real horror movie, please scroll through. If you are looking to be entertained, or better yet, if you are one of those people who like horror movies mixed in with the sub mediocre comedy, like the 'Scary Movie' types, only then do I recommend this.I basically laughed out so loudly throughout most of this movie. The acting was so hilarious and overdone and painfully forced. The behaviour of the 'zombies' was unpredictable because sometimes when the plot wanted it they could walk only slowly, sometimes run away like athletes with ghoulishly done faces, and sometimes just look too lost, it almost felt they were sympathetic of the main characters sad life. I cried laughing. I love horror movies, but this is not a good portrayal of one."
" Very poor copy of World War Z
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,1,"I was expecting a good production and a really fun movie. After this my day is worse and I have lost 2 hours of life.
The scenario is terribly bad and also the attempt to plagiarize World War Z.
On several occasions I have seen so bad acting that I had to roll the film in advance because it was a shame to watch it.
I know this is an apocalyptic SF movie but there are a lot of unrealistic situations as well as too much anticipation for the characters to react to some action.
Just horrible.
Do NOT recomend this to anyone!!!"
" Not the everyday zombie movie you are expecting to see.
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,8,"Asian movies are such an underrated jem and this movie proves it once again. The tension building, the acting, the drama, the horror, the very good looking zombies, the emotions, everything is top class. You know a movie is good when you deeply connect with the main character in only 1 hour of watching. The zombies are not those typical zombies you see in every zombie movie, plus they are being smarter than the usual ones. 8/10 at least for me"
" Intense!!
",2018-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Train to Busan is that kinda of movie that you will love it or will hate it.
Everything here is intense from the beginning to the end... when you think it's over, things can change at the very last minute.. it's crazy.
The plot is pretty modern and can relate to almost everyone who watches it.. and this only makes the things better for this movie.
For me, it's a ""must see"" movie. By far, my fave horror movie this decade."
" Wow what a masterpiece!
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie has everything! makes you feel pretty much a bit of everything! How are the actors not known? i didn't know them until i watched the movie, they are talented ! Nothing negative to say about the movie, loved it ! Best zombie movie i have seen in a while since World War Z"
" Train to Busan is easily one of the best modern zombie thrillers.
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Flipping heck this was an emotional rollercoaster. It's a simple formulaic plot: we follow a family or group of people, a viral outbreak occurs, lots of biting and blood whilst ending with some sacrifices. ""Go! Save yourselves! I'll hold them off""...y'know, that kind of heroism. We've seen it all before. What makes this refreshing and exciting is the actual emotional connection we form with the characters. They aren't all just expendable, they do indeed have some soul. A struggling father to a daughter, a pregnant woman with her devoted partner, a young loved up couple...and a COO of a massive company. Before I begin, I have to let off some steam. The COO was the biggest (try not to swear!)...ummm...coward ever (phew...that'll do). He absolutely boiled my blood. Infuriated the flip out of me. I stood up and simply shouted ""SOMEONE KILL HIM ALREADY!?"". Yet somehow I related to him. In fact I related to most of the characters, they each had individual strands of different personalities that made the plot compelling. It's about self-sacrifice and willing to help others rather than being selfish. Our lead character undergoes this transformation exquisitely, the pressure of survival moulded him into a better human being. It isn't just ""oh my God zombies, let's run this way!!"" (although that is present), there's some heart within the frantic action which I found to be admirable. Extremely well paced for a two hour flick, didn't get bored once. The makeup for the infected looked authentic. Plenty of blood, dark veins and a really nice touch with the grey eyes. I was on the edge of my seat on multiple occasions particularly during the chase scenes. The cinematography was clean and sharp, incredible picture quality. I did find the visual effects to be below average, especially fires or breaking of glass. CGI zombies are kept to a minimal but is unfortunately used. Also punching the infected just relinquishes the fear of them, I was no longer scared of them. However, a damn entertaining train ride."
" Simply amazing
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Hello,First, I'd like to mention that this is my first time writing a review and second time watching a foreign movie.The movie's plot is about a virus that breaks out in South Korea (obviously) whilst our main character and his daughter board a train to get to Busan, hence the movie name, so the daughter can see her mother. 
In the first 25 minutes of the movie nothing of interest happens, but a few scenes that won't make you adjust your seating. Highlights are an infected girl entering the train and (presumably) the president giving a speech on national TV, trying to calm the citizens and telling them that there are no zombies, just aggressive/violent people + the introduction of a married couple.
Fast-forward, the train is now full of infected people and the train has to stop at Daejeon where they will be quarantined, but the train passengers are unaware, which made me confused why won't you tell them that they will be quarantined; I mean at leas they know they will be safe? Why would the train stop even that they did not see any military personnel. why wouldn't the conductor try to recontact the command center?
Anyhow, people re-board the train and several thrill and drama packed fights happen as the survivors are split onto 3 different cars and try to reunite.
Another interesting point for me here: when the husband of the pregnant wife was trying to hold close the door, why didn't anyone just try to cover it as they know the infected people would become passive after it? The husband ends up dead in a drama of sacrifice for the sake of his wife and other survivors. Moving on to the next scene after the rest of the survivors manage to regroup in the last car, they were despised by the other group and obeyed their request to leave, which was weird as they were the much stronger group + armed with bats + they just finished fighting like 20 infected people. You can clearly see the hate of Seok Woo when he looks at the COO of the railroad company (remember this scene).The train later stops because of a blockage caused by containers even though I don't see a cargo train nearby. The conductor disembarks and tells other survivors to meet at the far left railroad. 
The COO of the company again sacrifices another person (the conductor in this case) so he can survive.
Now, Seok Woo meets the COO on the locomotive but he is still scared and passive, and a very weak fight scene takes place which results in our hero putting his hand in the infected COO's mouth for some reason. Hero gets infected, sacrifices himself, his daughter lives along with the pregnant woman yay!To put this short, Train to Busan put me in an amazing mood as I adore South Korea, but there many situations that I find weird, especially the COO fighting the father! That guy just made you lose your friends and is an egoist bastard, then he even tries to attack your daughter while he is infected, all that and all you can do is Ugh and Ahh?! Maybe I am not familiar with the South Korean culture and that they're peaceful by nature, but still the adrenaline rush would've helped.
Train to Busan literally feels like a trip through Korea and emotions for me even though you don't see much, but you don't feel like an outcast, you still feel heavily related to the characters and location, but I believe that the director could've made the death of Jin Hii more dramatic as they looked like an interesting couple. I appraise the fact that it wasn't an all pink everyone survives ending, you rarely see that these days.
I hope the sequel focuses more on the damage done to the cities and people, and makes you deeply related with 2 or 3 characters only instead of mildly interested in all of them."

" Subtitles been turning you off? OMG, YOU WILL GET PAST IT
",2018-02-20 00:00:00,9,"So I had heard of this movie for a while before watching. I absolutely LOVE zombie movies and tv shows. But the idea of having to pay close attention to subtitles, kinda turned me off, as I'm not used to having to do so.
I AM SO GLAD I GAVE THIS FILM A CHANCE.
It is now one of my favorite zombie movies. The acting was incredible. And I love their twist on a zombies weakness. 
Would love to see a sequel to this movie, as it would be interesting to see how people managed with the said weakness."
" Such a good movie!
",2018-02-15 00:00:00,9,"I've been surfing Netflix a lot lately and i came across this movie and really had no idea how it was going to turn out. Korean movies especially on Netflix seem to be a hit or miss sort of deal. 
BUT!
This film had such a good and believable atmosphere, it had the ability to make me feel anxious, angry, scared and sad all at the same time. The characters are well written and the story is good. When i wasn't on the edge of my seat I was crying. I love this movie and have seen it many times now. It never fails to make me cry. 
It's definitely a film you have to see if you like apocalypse themes. I loved it <3"
" A throwback to simpler times
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,8,"This horror/action movie follows a rather typical setting. Confined space and a very personal, limited cast of protagonists. Those are stereotypical .. but not dull. There is character developement .. believable .. as well as sacrifice and heroism. All is done in a very ""natural"" .. not forced way. There are manierisms that feel a bit foreign to western culture, i guess .. but nothing that is in the way of understanding the plot. I would guess that an asian viewer might pick up on things a western viewer might not .. but those would only be subtle. Action is well done with a few CGI effects (regarding the horde) that do look rather odd. Most effects seem to be practical though and the acting is mostly well done (despite the occasional overacting and the obviously overacted ""bad guy"")Since it is a very classic zombie story, there are the typical weaknesses of course .. but all in all .. the movie is engaging and very enjoyable to watch .. although not a suspeseful as other horror movies (it was more an action flick in my opinion that just happened to have zombies in it)"
" Amazing.
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,10,The claustrophobic nature of the train mixed with the intensity of World War Z or 28 Days Later styles of zombies makes for an exciting viewing.
" It makes you feel like a character.
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,2,"First of all. WOW! I watched it with a concern that it would just be another zombie movie where flat main characters fight zombies for no purpose other than their survival. I was totally wrong.
The main characters are introduced quite well at the begging, and well developed during the movie. For example the dad. A fund manager by the name of Seok-woo, is shown since the start that he is not a guy that spends time with his daughter, he shows it by giving her a Wii when she already had one. During the duration of the train ""adventure"" the son and daughter develop a relationship that was hidden inside of both of their minds. All of that is shown when the dad is bitten, the kid does not want to let him go. 
In the end everything about this movie is great."
" Scary fun!
",2018-01-13 00:00:00,6,"This movie was literally a Korean Version of World War Z because of it's action. Unlike going across the world to find a origin of the virus this is more of surviving on a train with a bunch of characters that you can actually remember unlike some movies where they introduce the character but don't go as much in-depth. I also liked how they somewhat had a basis on what happened.
What I didn't like were the first 15 minutes. When the man ran over the deer and the deer got reanimated I never understood it's purpose rather than the zombies are rising. I never understood much also of the main character's business and work, maybe if they added 5 minutes somewhere in the beginning of him talking more to his Mother it would've added more sentimental value."
" A Powerful Story About Humanity with All Its Good and Bad
",2018-01-09 00:00:00,9,"Wow. I'm still crying. This movie was beautiful. I don't mean that aesthetically because as a zombie movie, with all the gore that comes with the genre, it's not pretty to look at. The zombies are all very gross, satisfyingly so to a zombie aficionado but undoubtedly a bit much for the average person. The zombie deer in particular is NASTY the way it twists itself back onto its feet after being hit by the car. But the zombies aren't the point of the movie and aren't why the film is beautiful so I'll move on.This film explores both innate human selfishness and innate human selflessness in both aspects. Our main character is a father who spends too much time working and not enough time with his (ADORABLE!!!) daughter. He's made himself such a stranger to his child that he buys her a Wii which she already has, and from what I was given to understand he purchased for her a previous holiday(though that may be wrong as I don't speak Korean and the subtitles went by fast). At one point Dear Old Dad flat out tells his kid to only look out for herself, not to do anything as simply kind as to give her seat up to an elderly woman. So Dad starts off in a very selfish place and then there's the other guy, whose name I didn't care to catch, some suited jerk that LEAVES PEOPLE TO THE ZOMBIES REPEATEDLY. Wow, why is it always like that in zombie movies? If the zombie apocalypse does happen, I'm going to be sorely tempted to kick any dude in a suit out of my space before he screws me over. Anyway the selfishness of humanity is on full display when Suit Jerk convinces a car full of people not to help the elderly woman, a pregnant woman and her husband, Dad and his daughter, and some poor kid. He actually gets them kicked out of the car for no reason than his own selfishness and fear. Suit Jerk also sacrifices two train employees to make his escape and throws a teenage girl to the zombies. What a sorry excuse for a human being! But that's selfishness for you and that's not what makes the movie beautiful so I must move on.It's the kindness and selflessness of multiple characters that won my heart, made this movie a beautiful story and caused me to give it 5 stars. It starts small, the little girl giving up her seat to the old woman but it grows. Dad shakes off his bad attitude after being called out by the Father to Be of the Pregnant Lady's baby and he starts actively helping to save people. Father to Be later pulls a heroic sacrifice to hold a door so the group can get into a train car that doesn't contain zombies, but before he does he shouts to his wife what their child's name will be. I cried. I still am sniffling. And the sports kid, he goes on a mission to free Dad's daughter, the Pregnant Lady and the old woman from a train bathroom with no benefit to himself. He does it because it's The Right Thing To Do. And I can't forget the disheveled guy, this poor man spends half his time tripping or alerting the zombies by making unintentional noise and he pulls another heroic sacrifice to save the girl and Pregnant Lady. IF YOU AREN'T CRYING THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU. In fact, helping others is the only way anybody stays alive. Everyone who makes selfish choices not only dies, but causes the deaths of those around them(Suit Jerk gets the whole train car full of people eaten). Yes the selfless choice of sacrifice also gets some people killed but they knowingly give their lives so others can go on. The reward is that others live. That's what makes this movie beautiful, it looks at the lesson Dad attempted to teach his daughter at the beginning and it goes ""No. Humanity does not survive by looking out for only yourself. Humanity survives by virtue of the courage to help others, to give, to GO BACK FOR PEOPLE, to be a HERO."" In a time where it is fashionable to put forth stories where #1 looks out for only #1, where you are told that some people are too slow, useless and not worth the effort, this movie makes the case that salvation is not earned by abandoning your fellow man but earned through being willing to look past yourself and Do What Is Right.And I'm sure there's symbolism to be found in the child and woman passing through the dark tunnel and being saved by the child singing but I'm too sad(in a good way) by the movie's end to figure it out."
" One of the best Zombies movie!!
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Train To Busan, it's a south korean horror film, directed by Yeon Sang-ho. it lasted 118min ( it's one of the best 118min in my life Xd ). This movie is set in South Korea!
It started with Seok-Woo ( Gong Yoo ) who accepted his doughter's request, which is to take her to Busan to see her mother, because it's Su-An's birthday ( Well.. Su-An is the daughter:) ).. But the journey has been disrupted by a hellish on-board zombie outbreak.. And the real story begins... Who will survive? and How?
I think that it is more than a horror movie, because it shows how selfish, greedy a human can be... And It makes you realize how precious your father is. He is the one who will make many sacrifices for you when no-one will.. 
The ending was especially well-done and sentimental. A child who saved lives through her singing.. Which make me realize that music makes us feel secure..
Overall, ' Train To Busan ' is the best Zombie movie ( It's exciting, emotional and heartbreaking ) with a good child actor! Also the performances are convincing...
If you are a Zombie fan, you should definitly give this movie a try ;)."
" Wow, what I solid flick!
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I'm not a huge zombie fan by any means but I don't mind a good zombie flick. I ended up watching this because of the reviews and seriously, this is a solid movie. Never boring, not a ton of wasted moments (if any). Super acting. and SUPER zombie effects, movements, etc. Just a very well made Korean film with a good story also.I 100% recommend this movie, I don't think you'll be disappointed at all."
" Never thought I would describe a zombie movie as LOVELY
",2017-12-14 00:00:00,8,"Oh boy, did I love it!! It has everything from action and horror to heartfelt, slightly over the top k-drama music that highlights perfectly the plot. Believe it or not, there is also humor, amazing special effects and, the cherry on the top, the little girl's performance. However, expect stupid things to happen, like people forgetting how to run, people being extra-loud, people not checking minor details like looking behind them, etc. But maybe that's too be expected in a dangerous, totally new situation? 
As a bonus, you MIGHT enjoy the lack of brain smashing scenes, brain goo, heads exploding like pumpkins, etc. so feel free to enjoy plenty of snacks while watching this zombie flick. Overall, I would call it a decent, clean zombie drama, with some horror elements and very theatrical music."
" Good but overrated
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,7,"When I sit to watch zombie movie I expect horror, action, maybe even comedy, I expect B production and certain level of frivolity. Instead, Train to Busan brings A production and very serious drama. Essentially, this is not a zombie movie. This is movie about human relations and what they become in state of panic. Story that is seen many times before, but it's usually placed in war or natural disaster surrounding, while here they placed it in zombie apocalypse. This is not original story, this is just somewhat original mash-up of pretty much outworn clichés. Mash-up of disaster drama and zombie apocalypse we already have in Walking Dead. Walking Dead + Snowpiercer = Train to Busan. So, it's definitely not original. Further, action part of the story is painfully dumb. again we have bunch of people acting stupid and illogical in order to stretch movie to two hours. Most obvious example are survivors piercing through wagons crowded with zombies. In every new wagon they find different way to get from back to front door, risking their lives again and again. The only goal of those inventive new solutions is to fill half of the movie with thrilling action, while there is simple, obvious and safe solution put aside as it does not exist. Simply tell driver to stop the train in next tunnel (cause zombies attack only people they clearly see), then leave the train through door, walk outside the train to desired wagon, enter it and journey can be continued. Logical, practical, safe, but also a scene that would last just a few minutes and deprived us of the most exciting part of the movie. Stupidity and illogicality in service of agony prolongation is something we are used to in most of horror movies, but in serious drama it simply doesn't hold. Technically and visually it's well done and personal drama is deep and strong, but overall this is unoriginal movie with stupid plot and bunch of redundant action. And it does not have even H of horror.6,5/10"
" Finally! A modern zombie movie with someone to root for!
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,8,"8.2/10 Fun, flashy, emotional and inventive. Very fitting for a group watch, it's pretty easy to get involved. It tackles all known zombie mythos, but still manages to make them feel fresh. Movies set in 1 location can be either very efficient or lazy and this film is everything but lazy. If you want to get scared, pick something else, this is more of an action romp with zombies. The most surprising thing is how likable the characters are. It's a treat to have someone to root for."
" Better than Hollywood Zombies
",2017-11-09 00:00:00,10,"Although it is made in Korea, the essence of the story is far more meaningful and emotional than those of a Hollywood zombie movie. The drama is very touching. I've never felt so sad watching a zombie movie before. The entire scene from start to finish really consume you. Just like those Divergent trilogy. Even though it's a 2 hour movie, you just can't get enough of it and wanting for more. Like it should be a 3 hour movie. It really hooks your attention to it.The characters are convincing. The zombies are reacting logically. Every aspect of the movie is just logical and reasonable. There's no hyperbolic scenes which usually happen in a Hollywood movie. This Korean movie deserves to rival top class Hollywood zombie movie."
" Last Train Home
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,9,"The horror genre has its fair share of hits and misses, however, it would seem that the sub genre of zombie horror suffers from the greatest ratio of misses to hits. Yes, the genre does have George A Romero's Night of the living dead and Dawn of the dead, as well as, spoof film Shaun of the Dead, but it would appear that is all we have. One must think hard to find a decent zombie film that doesn't end in ""of the dead""... Until now. Director, Sang-ho Yeon makes his live-action debut with what is in my opinion, the best zombie horror film ever. 2016's Train to Busan, or Busanhaeng as it's pronounced in its native country of South Korea, is more than just a simple zombie film, it's ultimately about evaluating what matters most in life, as well as being a social commentary of Korea's government and perhaps even our own.Train to Busan's success as a horror film could be boiled down to a singular detail, character development. Countless horror films don't take the time to establish and expand upon their characters, resulting in little to no tension, people you more or less want to die and the audience's overall detachment from the film. The social messages of Train to Busan demand fully realised characters for them to have an impact, and fortunately, the filmmakers choose to flesh out a number of characters rather than a limited few. The film's main protagonist, Seok-woo, is a father who prioritises his work over his family, now having again disappointed his daughter, Soo-an, Seok-woo reluctantly agrees to take Soo-an to see her mother in Busan for her birthday, but of course, the zombie outbreak makes things a little bit more difficult The film is primarily the journey, pardon the pun, of Seok-woo as he's forced to be the protecting father he wasn't pre-outbreak and witness the consequences of his actions as a fat cat businessman. As well as this, the film features a married couple expecting their first child, however, the father has yet to name the baby. I for one, found the couple and their love for each other to be the most impactful and engaging. Train to Busan also features; a sports team where one member and a cheerleader have an off and on relationship, two elderly sisters who care deeply for one another and a selfish business owner who I believe represents the ruling class in Asia. Train to Busan is rich with subtext, making it more of a mental and emotional journey than a physical one.In addition to the emotional message of human life matters most, Train to Busan is contextually relevant in the modern day. With North and South Korea technically still at war having never signed a peace treaty, but more importantly, North Korea's constant threat of nuclear attacks and Donald Trump Well Doing what he does best as president, adding fuel to the fire and being racist So it's safe to say things are pretty sh*t in Korea at the moment. Train to Busan takes aim at the ruling class, from the fat cat businessmen like our protagonist to the government itself, controlling the media and thus the people to fit with their political agenda. The continent of Asia is no stranger to censorship and unquestioned authority figures such as dictators, and so I believe Sang-ho Yeon is attempting to highlight the errors of totalitarianism by effectively bringing a ruling class man to the ground, to see the errors of his ways and the ways of those like him. The shoe is on the other foot and together with the breathtaking performances from the films cast along with the films character development, this message is made all the more powerful.It isn't all serious however, there is a lot of fun to be had and the film is incredibly entertaining. The action set pieces throughout Train to Busan are large in scale, visually stunning and seriously impressive. Visceral imagery takes the place of cheap jump scares in this competently directed action horror film. Yeon wants to scare you with the culturally relevant subtext, in conjunction with horrifying imagery, instead of simply relying on a loud noise. Director Sang-ho Yeon also understands the horror genre, its themes and concept. It's all about fear, but not just of a killer, a ghost, a vampire or zombie etc. Horror can be the fear of anything and Yeon has made a film that is more about the fear of failing as a parent, disappointing your family and fearing for your country, than it is about the fear of zombies. The human fear amongst the supernatural is what truly makes Train to Busan the best of its genre.The world is a scary place. The divides between the rich and the poor remain intact and the threat of war is ever-present. Yet humanity does exist, there is light in the darkness we just have to open our eyes to the horror of others. Train to Busan is a poignant, relevant and phenomenal film which takes the audience on the same emotional journey as its characters. It's an extremely tense film thanks in no small part to the phenomenal cast and use of character development. This film can be read on a number of levels, I just hope people see it for what it truly is, a social and political statement highlighting the lack of humanity seen in the modern day."
" Was not expecting that!
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,10,"I decided to watch ""train to busan"" because I was bored on a 7 hour car ride back home so I went onto Netflix to find a good movie to watch. It had been on my list to watch for a while so I decided to give it a shot.... wow! I was skeptical because I had never seen a South Korean film but that blew my mind! This movie is definitely in my top 3 of all time and might possibly be my favorite of all time(not counting zombie comedies). The character development was amazing for this type of movie! The zombies weren't too dumb looking which I was afraid would be the case. And it actually had a good ending! The movie was well made and well acted. First time I've had to hold back a tear watching a zombie type movie! Must watch for zombie fans! 10/10!!"
" One of the Best Pure Zombie Flicks Ever
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,8,"Very few modern zombie flicks are as consistent to the tone and intent of Romero's films as this. Regularly people, living their lives, suddenly faced with terror and death. But where Night of the Living Dead is a slow-burn thriller, this is an edge-of-your-seat action-horror whirlwind. The performances are fantastic, and the final 15 minutes is unexpectedly moving. A little long and sporadically hacky? Maybebut it's mostly just a cool and scary ride."
" Train to Busan: A contender for the greatest zombie movie ever made
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,10,"There are rare events in our world, solar eclipses, tsunami's, the UK chart having a decent song at no.1. Another is me giving a film 10/10, it simply doesn't happen.Me and Korean cinema have always had a good relationship, I tend to enjoy their works and this right here is their coup de grace.Essentially a sequel to Seoul Station (2016) which was an acclaimed feature length zombie anime, Train To Busan tells the story of the passengers of a train from Seoul to Busan as the outbreak begins.Full of fantastic characters, great writing and several scenes that need to be seen to be believed Train To Busan shows how fresh the zombie sub genre can be in the right hands.The film looks incredible and flows perfectly all the way from the first victim to the incredible memorable finale.Train To Busan is nothing short of a masterpiece that I would recommend to everyone not just fans of the genre.I would love to see a sequel as this was near perfection.The Good:Brilliant characters/character developmentLooks outstandingHighly originalAction packedEmotionally charged and thought provokingThe Bad:Can't think of a thing"
" Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,10,"This is without a doubt the best zombie movie we have ever seen! I would say that it is better than Dawn of the Dead. The movie has non-stop thrills, nonstop kills, nonstop action and nonstop emotion. We get to know each character one by one and bit by bit but the main focus here was Seok-woo (Yoo Gong) and his daughter Soo-Ann (Su-An Kim). Their journey to survive the zombie apocalypse made you want them both to live. Along the way we meet many other interesting characters and a very horrifying villain by the name of Yon-suk (Eui-sung Kim). He is by far the most nastiest, greediest and most coldest person you will probably ever meet. He kills so many people along the way in order to save himself from the zombies. The movie is just beyond incredible and it's way better than any is zombie Hollywood movie That we've ever seen! The makeup and effects are just incredible and so passes and he zombie movie with seen since Dawn of the Dead. Only problem English people may have with it is that it is in North Korean subtitles but that didn't bother us one bit as we don't mind reading subtitles. Highly recommended to every zombie fan all over the world and if you want to see excellent character development along with people and characters who you actually care about we highly recommend this film! 5/5 stars"
" Good story and plot, however the suspense is forced
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,6,"I was hesitant to watch another zombie movie but after all the positive user reviews, I decided to give it a go.This is an overall good movie apart from one major detail. Most of the suspense is created by making characters act irrational or slow. This is an ""easy"", effective suspense, but truly annoying. There is no need for it.Great SFX nevertheless.(ATM I have 500+ ratings but this is my first review, mostly because I am a bit annoyed at this movie and the overrated user reviews)."
" The best zombie movie I ever seen too!
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,9,"About Time! All my life I wanted a real zombie film! In seconds they cemented the rules here! THey see you In light. Clear as day! In The walking dead they still haven't set the rules down after 7 seasons! and I still wonder what makes the zombies tick. Everything seems to apply there, They come towards you if they spot flames? if they here sound, their blood doesn't affect you if you get it in the eyes etc. THey smell you? It's different tricks I get that, but TWD clearly doesn't know themselves. As many others I've seen countless of zombie films, better for worse. All these parodies that sucked so bad,Not fun at all. THe old occult 70s zombie flicks I love! but they are more summoned by ancient powers and a bit tame in the practical effect department. but it ain't what I've been craving for. evil dead and re animator, planet terror are more demonic etc etc, Train to busan gets it right In seconds. Its a joyride finish to end. ALl the actors play their part perfectly for what the script gave them. It may be a little lighthearted and not gory at all. But that wasn't the intention here i believe. It's a zombie film to just sit back, drink a cup of coffee and enjoy. and for what it does. It's excellent. The only little thing I can complain about is the world war z cgi piles. Even if many other zombie films does something better here and there. many of them have great set design or really badass zombies but they falter big time through the rest with some silly side story or a super boss zombie demon or some other crap. Train to Busan Is by far the most perfect zombie film I ever seen."
" When you think zombie theme is done...
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,8,"What an surprise, what a trip, what a drama and action! Train to Busan is filmography at it's best. Directed and shoot perfectly, acting spot on, specially Su-An (little girl) and her dad, but everyone else gave and did their best as well, to the point of actually not having any minus to give as a rewiever. True thriller, with deeply emotional ending, specially if you are a parent. Can't wait for part two. Cast is amazing, story done well, although one would think zombie theme is done for good. It is a must see gem of a genre. I give it a 9 just because of not knowing how outbreak started. If second part gives the answer, I promise to.come back and give first part a clean 10!You will not regret seeing this one.P.S. If you go to.see it with girlfriend, at the end of the.movie...act like there is something in your eye, cause you don't want your girl to see you cry. :)"
" Keyword: Zombie
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,8,"Seok Woo is a fund manager in Seoul. His wife left him and lives in Busan. Seok didn't spend a lot of time with his family, always at work. After screwing up his daughter Soo-an's birthday, he fulfills her wish of wanting to go to Busan and see her mother. During this time there is ""a small leak at the plant"" which leads to the proverbial zombie outbreak and of course one gets on the train to create havoc for the film.The film is a bit heavy. It is about family, sharing, and sacrifice...things Seok Woo placed second to himself. He now must work as a team and learn different values to save his daughter. The film becomes a bitter-sweet zombie drama before it is all over. Almost 2 hours long and needs about 10-15 minutes cut from it.Guide: No sex or nudity. No swearing in the English subtitles, but I think there was some in Korean not translated."
" worst movie ever!!
",2017-10-06 00:00:00,1,"In the movie I think the uninfected people are more dumb than the actual zombies.Want to kill a zombie? why not close it's mouth using your unprotected hand and let's pray you don't get bitten. this is the stupidest movie ever. World record for most time wasted. Just wasted my 2 hours for this piece of garbage, I don't know why people like this. Want to save your precious daughter? well let's not kill a person who is turning a zombie,lets wait until he turn into zombie and then hopefully he won't attack us."
" Surprisingly very good
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,9,"Im reading some of haters reviews and what can i say, people really don't know what they are writing because they are blessed with primitive brains and from what i red some of them like to eat human flesh :), do you really wanna trust that kind of person? They don't see the point of sacrifice and desperation (i know, this is not a drama, its a zombie movie, but the end is really tense (some said even heartbreaking) if u really watching the movie. I wont give an example because i wont ruin it for people who likes movies of such a genre. Movie is high budget, its not some third-rate American bullshit. Acting always can be better, but its not bad at all. U can always find some bad stuff in the movie, but what movie isn't bad than? Content of movie is tense from the beginning till the very end. So if u love zombie movies and u wish to watch a ""good zombie movie"", surprisingly this is it. The best zombie movie i have seen in a long long time."

I'd have to say I loved the Characters,Hated some and the movie had so much Heart, good amount of action and the ending will leave you teary eyed. Overall I'd have to say Train to Busan is an Excellent movie and worth the watch."
" A Must-See.
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,8,"I adore this movie. I've watched Train to Busan a couple of times now, and it keeps my attention on it every time.Zombie movies are almost as numerous as zombie books, it seems. You get to the point where it's like ""Okay, been there, done that."" So it takes a certain kind of zombie film to make you want to watch it more than once.Train to Busan starts off a bit slow, but it's necessary. By the end of it, I was rooting for the surviving characters, and cheering for the director and some of the choices that they made. The ending is wonderfully done. The last 15 minutes or so of the film are almost impossible to look away from.I normally go for Norwegian movies for my foreign film fix, but South Korea is definitely start to get my attention. Train to Busan is a must watch for any zombie-movie fiends out there."
" A Very Good Zombie Thriller, Worth A Watch
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,7,"This is one of the better zombie movies I've seen in a long, long time. The zombies are scary and the first half of the movie packs a lot of tension. Especially the moments when the passengers(what's left of them) flee from the train and attempt to come out of a station and the utter mayhem that awaits them is probably the best part of the movie. There's good drama too, the notable among them like the father and daughter conversation or that between a pregnant wife & her husband. I was totally hooked until the final few scenes that I felt didn't pack much punch like the initial horror. There's also a particular scene towards the end where a negative character who survived so far finally gets bitten but how he turns while he still begs to be saved looked almost comical in this otherwise intense thriller. The best performances were from Eui-sung Kim as a very selfish passenger and child actor Su-an Kim. Verdict - get your popcorn & soda, and munch away your jitters while you watch this one."
" Boring overall
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,3,I think this movie is overrated and caricatural by many aspects. The acting seems forced all the way through and there's no originality to it. It's really just another zombie film to me and not a particularly entertaining one. Although I usually like Asian cinema better over American blockbusters because the plots tend to be very well written and the protagonists have a complex psychology. This is however not the case in this movie.
" For a Korean film it's very Hollywood
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,6,"It was a good action film, a very good zombie film. But lacked the quirkiness or charm of the best Korean films. It had great characters, good acting (especially the daughter), believable story line, excellent suspense, and pacing. So what was wrong with it? I believe it just comes down to the mental age of the film which is about 19."
" Stuck on a Train with Zombies and Nowhere to Escape
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,5,"""Seok-woo"" (Yoo Gong) is a fund manager who spends all of his time at the office which has subsequently damaged his marriage beyond repair. As luck would have it, however, he happens to have his young daughter ""Soo-an"" (Su-an Kim) with him for a few days and to cheer her up agrees to accompany her on the morning train from Seoul to Busan to be with her mother. However, upon boarding the train they discover that a zombie apocalypse has just started in Korea and that they are trapped inside one of the passenger cars with no ability to escape. As a result the uninfected passengers are forced to band together to keep the determined zombies as bay. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a fairly solid zombie film which emphasized the ultra-fast variety in lieu of the typical slow-moving type. Because of that the action is quite brisk which initially worked quite well for the majority of the film. Unfortunately, I must admit that the non-stop action tended to become somewhat tedious after a while. Likewise, the rather poor ending didn't exactly help in that regard either. In any case, as I stated earlier this was a decent zombie movie for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Average."
" Investigate humanities ego-tripping psyche in a zombie movie
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,9,"I believe this is the best zombie film I've seen so far. It is not overdone, like so many of the big screen zombie films are. There is some kind of outbreak at a facility and people are evacuated. During the outbreak day a girl is going to visit her mother in another place. To reach the destination she has to take the train to Busan. This trip turns out differently than expected. During their trip there is a outbreak of a zombie sickness. People simply turn into zombies and try to eat non infected people. This outbreak also happens on the train. How will they handle it? Is there any way to survive this train trip and reach the destination? There is a lot of blood and splatter and if you are a sensitive person this is not a film for you. But if you adore zombie movies, this is one of the better ones. It is not overcooked, no this production is just right. It is enough of everything. Somehow this movie also investigates how far you are willing to go for your self interests. Are you willing to help other's on your way? Or are you ego, just doing what benefits you, even if that means other people dying? Somehow this is about how we people turn on each other in crises. So who are you, the good samaritan or the self-centered asshole? Well, I guess Train to Busan just puts all these things on display. You might even learn something about humanity watching this zombie movie. Interesting right? It's well worth seeing this movie. Sit down, be on the edge for a while. The grade is a grade set where I compare it with other zombie movies."
" Not only a brilliant zombie blockbuster, but enthralling and riveting all the way through
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,8,"In what is easily the best zombie movie in recent years, Train To Busan proves an enormously entertaining watch at every minute, featuring twists and turns galore to the backdrop of an intensely action-packed battle for survival, yet still with an incredible amount of emotion and heart, thanks to some very well-developed characters and strong performances throughout.There's a lot to love about this movie, but I'm going to start off with why it makes the zombie genre, one that often falls flat, really work. For me, zombie movies are regularly frustrating watches, proving to be nothing more than two hours of running away from a mass of mildly threatening things, and never really allowing for anything different to spark genuine interest or excitement.Fortunately, what Train To Busan does is keep the simplest and most effective characteristics of the zombie genre, but make sure that it never loses sight of what makes a good film. As a result, while there's so much fantastic zombie action, and some properly intense violence that makes the undead far more threatening villains than normal, it's the film's story that really makes it work so well.Above all, the depth of character development is the biggest success of the whole film. Starting off with a concise and interesting introduction to our main characters, looking at a father obsessed with his work and how that has alienated his own daughter, the film doesn't languish about when it comes to being more thorough, but the background that it does give you is absolutely vital for the rest of the film.Following on from the father and daughter, we're introduced just as efficiently to a couple of other major characters on the train that will be integral to the fight for survival, and it's the fact that get a genuine emotional insight into each of them that means you can really fear for them in this situation, and will them to survive against what seem like impossible odds.Throughout, the film proves itself bold and daring by making sure no major characters are 100% safe, and that means you're sitting on an emotional knife-edge at every moment. It's not the action and pace that makes this film a thrilling watch, but the fact that you're so enthralled in the story, and each and every turn proves yet another incredible twist.The performances in this film are also just as strong. The excellent character development is matched by a selection of both likable and brilliantly dastardly performances across the board, and although that doesn't always excuse the occasional stupid character decision to advance the plot, it reinforces your emotional connection to the leads, and with the likes of Gong Yoo and Ma Dong-seok in particular putting in fantastic turns, you won't be able to look away from the movie's fantastic heroes.And finally, I can't forget to say that this movie is a hell of a lot of fun. Its drama may be enthralling, and its emotion powerful, but it's still a playful and hyperbolic zombie movie that will put as much of a smile on your face as put you on the edge of your seat. It's not a downbeat, apocalyptic disaster movie like World War Z or so many Hollywood zombie flicks, but rather a vivacious and rapid-fire blockbuster full of life and humour to go along with its excellent story.Overall, I was absolutely thrilled by Train To Busan. An incredibly entertaining movie that outdoes almost every zombie movie before it, it impresses with excellent performances and directing, and a story that prioritises enthralling characters and genuine drama over simple thrills and spills, but still leaves time for a load of great zombie action."
" Great action filled movie
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,8,"I can't possibly see enough Zombie movies before I die so I jumped into this one with few reservations even though it almost totally takes place on a train. The director did come through for me with excitement and gore aplenty .Asian action movies tend to be very direct and stereo-typical. There's usually a strong lead, a very evil character, pretty girls who require protection, and lots of cannon fodder bystanders.TRAIN TO BUSAN has all these hall-marks and, since I really love the Asian style, I really got into it.A few scenes were quite spectacular in the ferocity of the Zombie attacks. The carpet of zombies hanging off the back of the train was inspired. Also the scene where zombies were boiling through the carriage, covering every surface, was very effective.This is a great action movie. The only thing I hated was the subtitles."
" its hella crap
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,1,"words cannot describe how bad this film is, however numbers can. i rate this film 1/10 as it one of the cheesiest, dumb and stereotypical zombie films I've ever seen full with stupid tropes that provide nothing for the plot and only serve to extend the run time and entertain people with no sense of real intelligence. but it is fun to make fun of."
" ""Meh""
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,3,"WILL INDICATE SPOILERS Starring: -A boring monotonous main character -A little girl you don't care about -stereotypical strong man -Weirdly young looking old ladies -A predictable bad guyThe film starts strong, giving you an interesting situation tensely introduced (though dismiss the fact theirs a homeless man on the train for no reason). It then dissolves into a wonderful outbreak occurring, very well done. But then it begins to try make you care about characters that are just bad at acting... the main actor is dreadful. You literally won't feel any care at all for him, or the little girl that non stop complains. As you'd expect a film like this needs the also have a pregnant women so you feel some tension, and while this is quite stereotypical, she was one of the better actors in the film. The story is just abysmal, and the main character doesn't help at all. A stereotypical business man must get his kid to safety. But get ready for multiple references to how horrible he is. The whole plot has a nice general idea ruined by stupid situations where you'll find yourself saying ""really?"" A lot. SPOILERS: Also, if you've watched it... how did they expect to ""verify"" anything walking through the tunnel when it's ""too dark""??? Looks like they'll be shooting everyone on sight. TLDR: Poor acting, forced situations, and SO many stereotypical characters will make you go ""really?"" One too many times."
" More than just a zombie movie, and suspenseful nonetheless
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,8,"TRAIN TO BUSAN is a zombie movie for sure. But it's also a story about a father and his daughter. And it's a story about greed and sacrifice. This zombie movie has more heart than most other movies of the genre, yet it will also make most genre fans happy by having some pretty darn scary zombies.I thought this was an all-round solid movie with some scenes that were nail-bitingly suspenseful, effective cinematography, a fast-moving plot, and some decent acting. There's a few cliché moments in there, but hey, that's o.k.! TRAIN TO BUSAN did succeed in conveying some genuine emotions, as well as a genuine sense of dread and apocalypse. I highly recommend it."

" Not that good
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,5,"A farmer is stopped at some decontamination checkpoint. There's some leak at a biotech plant.Next we meet the boss of some investment firm. He's of course too busy to pay attention to his young daughter who wants to visit her mom in Busan. The dad finally agrees and they make it to the train station. On they way there's something going on, lots of emergency vehicles are driving somewhere. As the train departs zombies attack the train station and one actually makes it on the train.This zombie attacks some train attendant who bites another one and so on. Here the transformation into a zombie is near instantaneous. Depending on the needs of the script it may happen right away or it may take a minute or two. When eventually the passengers catch on what is going on, they run to the front of the train while the zombies end up in the rear. But by now the condition is spreading all over South Korea. The train isn't allowed to stop somewhere, communications are interrupted.We meet several characters: a pregnant woman and her tougher husband, two older women, a young baseball team, an even more arrogant and selfish business guy, and the train conductor.They do stop in some town where people would be quarantined by the military. But when they arrive and leave the train the military personnel is also infected. So it's back on the train but this time a group is in the back another in the rear. The ones in the back--our heroes--have to make it to the front where people are so freaked out they won't let them in.Things get grimmer and we'll have to see who actually survives this disaster as they get closer and closer to Busan.Train to Busan is a long, slow, melodramatic thriller with zombies piled up--I guess that's going to be the new trend thanks to World War Z, piles and piles of quick zombies. Despite the penchant for drama there's little dialogue and the characters' behavior often doesn't make a whole lot of sense mainly because for some reason they have nothing to say to each other. The zombie action is quick, somewhat unclear, individual zombies matter little but masses of zombies falling out of train cars like cockroaches are emphasized. None of it is particularly scary or frightening, which it should be given that the humans in a train have only two places to go- to the front or to the back. There's not a whole lot of gore or violence. What is good though is the setting of a zombie movie in a train; and I also liked that the movie takes place mostly during the day.It's surprising that while this movie does point out the soullessness of business people it also makes one of them the hero. We do get some sense of Korean values--rigidity, deference to authority, overemphasis on education as a solution to all ills.I can't quite understand the high score of this movie. It is perfectly mediocre and stands out in no way whatsoever."
" Easily the best Zombie flick I have seen
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"Though of course, people would not agree with my assessment, I believe that train to Busan is a well adjusted film with elements of suspense, longing, tension, tragedy, sacrifice and terror thrown into the mix. It is a well rounded movie and the acting performances are above par. This I say when comparing it to movies belonging to the same genre. There is nothing here that hasn't been done before but the way it has been shot is commendable. The ride starts early and the tension does not let up for a single moment. Especially heart rending is the scene towards the end where the father sacrifices himself to save his daughter. It is the sort of movie that stays with you long after the credits role because you start to think - what would you do when you face such insurmountable odds. Again, not something that is unique to this movie but the way it has been done is unique and appealing. Altogether an excellent movie. Now let's wait for Hollywood to butcher it with a remake."
" Absolutely flawless
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,10,"(If my English is not flawless, sorry. Second languish) A tiny tiny bit of spoilers!Firt of, there are two kind of zombie-movies. The one where the zombies are slow, instinct-based. The second one is where the zombies are like rabid dogs. This movie is the latter. Whichever one you prefer, it kinda doesn't matter because that isn't the most important part of this movie. What is, is how fast you start to care for the characters, which is where most horror-movies fail. And the writers has been really smart here. We have the father and his daughter, the pregnant woman and her husband and the elderly sisters. All of which, we as human are naturally inclined to wanna protect. Therefore we care!Train to Busan is fast paced, thrilling with non-stop action. This movie sailed right to the top of my all time favorite zombie-movies and to the top 10 of my favorite horror-movies. Absolutely flawless!"
" As good as the genre gets (and that's a compliment)
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,9,"I just finished a second viewing of this film (the first was at an art house cinema) and during this second viewing, the qualities of this picture became very clear (more so than during the first one). Yes, it does contain the zombie tropes and the characters nicely fall into the stereotypes: the jock, his girlfriend, the bad-ass, the evil businessman, Jordan Gekko, the little girl, the survivor, the old ladies,...But this is where the movie's strongest asset works: like TWD, it manages to make you care about the characters. The story leaves you just enough time to connect with them. Sometimes with a slice of comic relief, although to the movie's credit, that is not overdone either. It never becomes a jokey joke-thing and that's a quality as well.Once the zombies come into play, all the right buttons are pushed at the right moment. Timing is a quality not to underestimate.The moments that are meant to be tension filled succeed in doing so (the actors do a great job at making the characters look determined in their quest to survive) and when it wants to tug at your heart strings... well, it simply does. Some moments (like with Jin Hee and her boyfriend) are touching, but there is a moment near the end between Jordan Gekko and the little girl that is simply gut-wrenching. In terms of emotional impact, it's right up there with Sophia walking out of the barn, if you will. But in a different way.So, in short, it's a success all across the board. Highly recommended for horror fans."
" Korean zombie train
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,8,"It's the start of the zombie apocalypse. The population is caught unaware. An injured girl scrambles onto a train leaving Seoul for Busan. She had been bitten by an infected and soon becomes an infected herself. The infection spreads and the survivors find safety in a few cars. Among the survivors are a girl and her often-absent fund manager father, a strong man and his pregnant wife, two elderly sisters, a baseball team and one cheerleader, and a selfish businessman.This is solid zombie fare. The zombies are reminiscent of World War Z. In fact, it might as well be a small part of that franchise. The characters are well-drawn. They are memorable. There are about ten good characters. The action is thrilling and scary both small and large scale. There is good tension throughout. There is one climatic scene that is trying too hard emotionally but that's a small flaw in an otherwise flawless action film."
" In a time of zombie overkill, Train to Busan still manages to feel fresh
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,7,"Train to Busan, Sang-ho Yeon's hugely successful South Korean zombie movie, may just be the most effortlessly enjoyable action movie to feature the brain-hungry undead in years. Taking inspiration from the maestro who created the 'zombie' we know and love today, the late, great George A. Romero, as well as Danny Boyle's faster and scarier flesh-eaters, it's a wonderfully constructed and nail- bitingly tense piece, which manages to mix action, horror and a bit of family drama into two hours of pure entertainment. It also finds time to deliver a message amidst the carnage, and one that is perhaps more relevant than ever in these unpredictable times. In the most hopeless of situations, we must ultimately look out for one another if we are to stand a chance of surviving. Train to Busan condemns those who are willing to sacrifice others to save their own necks.Workaholic fund manager Seok-woo (Yoo Gong) is the kind of father who always seems to be on his phone at important family events. Divorced and single, he occasionally looks after his young daughter Soo-an (Su-an Kim) in the apartment he shares his mother, but pays such little attention to the girl that he buys her a Nintendo Wii for her birthday, forgetting that he got her the same present the previous year. What she really wants for her birthday is to see her mother in Busan, but Seok-woo is so busy at work that he is unable for find the time to accompany her on the 2 hour round-trip. After taking some advice from his mother, he eventually agrees. They arrive at the train station safe and sound, but it's clear that something isn't quite right. Police and ambulance sirens whizz by, people are running in the street, and the news reports show mass unrest and rioting across the country.Before the train doors shut however, a sickly woman gets on board. She soon collapses and starts to convulse, only for a poor train attendant to tend to her and wound up bitten. It's a big train however, and Train to Busan starts to clearly establish the collection of characters on board. There's a tough husband and his pregnant wife, two elderly sisters, a young cheerleader, a rich and selfish corporate type, and an entire baseball team, who are handily packing many bats in their luggage. Panic soon sets in as the realisation of a zombie apocalypse dawns on the passengers, and with much of the country either in quarantine or overrun by the military trying to fight off the unstoppable hoard, its unclear just where and when they can stop. Seok-woo's intentions are to look out only himself and his daughter, and teaches the seemingly wiser Soon-an the same. But as the situation becomes increasingly dyer, it becomes clear that they are stronger together.The atmosphere and tension are turned up to the max during some incredibly inventive set-pieces, which often make the most of the most mundane of locations. These are the running, screeching zombies of Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later, so cramped train carriages are quickly turned into narrow isles of death. As the passengers learn the zombies' weaknesses, such as their inability to work out a door handle or how they quickly forget about you once you're out of site, the darkness of long tunnels become their ally as they journey from A to B. Sang-ho Yeon is careful to keep the social commentary at the fore, highlighting how fear can turn the nicest of people into selfish, despicable monsters, and how important it is to fight out primal instincts in moments of terror. After a fast-paced first hour, the events become somewhat repetitive and the running time could do with some trimming, but it all pays off with a gripping climax. In a time of zombie overkill, Train to Busan still manages to feel fresh."
" Zombie Revival
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,8,"Train to Busan was a treat. A look into Selfishness vs Selflessness and Individual vs The Collective.I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a foreign film this much. The cinematography is excellent, the story is original, and I will definitely be keeping an eye on Sang-ho Yeon's future projects."
" Holy S##t!
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,10,"WOW! This movie delivers! One of the best horror let alone Zombie films ever! Great acting, great story, great effects, What a ride! No messing around 15 minutes in and all hell breaks loose, and doesn't stop! Glad I stumbled on to this one, what a gem! In a time where there is a different Zombie movie or show coming out all the time, this one definitely stands out, just watch it!"
" nice movie :p
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,8,"This movie is really good, the only thing that i didn't like was the title i thought that it would be better if it was ""Anything that can go wrong will go wrong: The Movie"" because it literally does, this movie also gave me crippling depression and i don't know if live is worth living anymore, Thank you :)"
" One of the best zombie movies i've ever seen
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,8,If you liked zombie movie World War Z then you will definitely like that one even more. The storyline is very good 9/10 Zombies are very realistic. IF you love fear and anxiety that movie is for you. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
" And old feel to a new zombie film
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,7,"Firstly I'll like to say this film has kept to the roots of a original zombie flick. Instead of 1000 CGI zombies who you can barley take serous, this film has spent a lot of time in actors and makeup effects that slow the actor to really give a human like movement and belivement in the zombies.For Asian film fans you will recognize some actors and to be honest the casting was on point. The only bad thing I have to say is some scenes were a lil unbelievable and yes I know its a zombie film but I think realistic outcomes make films a how lot better."
" Decent zombie flick. Fresh, but not spectacular. Worth a watch.
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,7,"I thought this was a pretty decent zombie flick. The pacing was good, but this is an action film more than a horror film. This was more World War Z than Night of the Living Dead. Some of the scenes were a bit of a stretch of the imagination, but it is a zombie film, not a biopic. There were quite a bit of ""feels"" which is usually hard to accomplish in a zombie film, and it actually felt pretty fresh without completely rewriting the genre. The movie effectively made you like some characters, love some characters, hate some characters, you get the point.Something that bothers me about zombie movies is the inconsistency of the zombie mechanics. How fast and strong a zombie is, how fast people turn, etc. This movie is pretty notorious for this. One minute, people take what seems to be up to 15 minutes plus to turn, then next minute people are turning immediately. Zombies are jumping over objects and mangling a group of people, and then in the next scene one man can hold back an entire zombie hoard by himself without a scratch. It definitely pulls you away from the story for a moment. Overall though, this was a decent film, and I had fun watching it. In the end, this is an action/horror film that should be treated as such. Don't expect everything to make perfect sense and don't expect stellar dialog and acting, although the acting is very decent for an action/horror film."
" Totally Recommend It-One of the top Zombie films I've Ever Seen
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,10,"This is not ""just"" a zombie film, it is a film with a message, carefully crafted, and with outstanding production value. When I was looking for a scare on Netflix, I saw this ""Korean Zombie Film"" I have never watched Korean Zombie Films before and decided to give it a look...and man...I was in for a thrill! The camera angles and framing are on point, character development and human emotion and psychology is in it for good. It is mostly action with the drama side of it to get stronger with perfect timing. There is a thing in it I considered a bit ridiculous, but I still give it a 10 out of 10 because this film is definitely art; specially something that happens by the end and the way it is portrayed... I clapped."
" A fun thriller
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,8,"This is only the second Korean film I've ever watched, (the first one being ""OldBoy"")and like ""Oldboy"" I enjoyed this quite a bit. The story is about a father who has a strained relationship with his young daughter, so much so the daughter wants to leave him and live with her mom instead. The daughter wants to ride the train by herself to Busan, the father decides he needs to go with her to try and save what little is left on his relationship with his daughter.Once on the train the fun truly begins. The ""zombies"" are relentless and people turn quite quickly after being bitten which I thought was awesome. Another aspect of the zombies was when the train would go through tunnels, the zombies effectively go blind. When a group of survivors need to get through a few of the train cars they use this to their advantage but only have a certain amount of time before the train comes out of the tunnel.You feel for the ""good guys"" and there are some comedic moments to relieve the tension with a few one liners here and there. One problem I had was towards the end, some of the decisions that were made by the protagonist weren't really smart compared to the others that were made earlier in the film. But just a minor blip in what was otherwise a fun and entertaining zombie movie."
" Formulaic zombie movie is still heartwarming and thrilling
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Well worth the hype! One of my favorite zombie movies because it also told good character stories. Did I cry? Yes. Did I feel it had some points for improvement? Sure, but I can overlook that. Was it unreal at some parts? Again, yes, but not enough to distract from its tension and drama. I'd watch it again and fully recommend it! Usually zombie movies get tired pretty quickly, but this one is a thrilling ride from start to finish."
" Amazing performance by that young girl
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,8,"The movie itself was pretty good. It felt almost like an old Irwin Allen disaster movie like The Towering Inferno or The Poseidon Adventure, with disparate groups of people being confined to a location or set piece where they have to confront and overcome adversity.But what stood out most to me was the performance by Kim Su-an who played the little girl Soo-an. In my view, the Korean acting style can at times be a bit theatrical or melodramatic. But not one beat of Kim Su-an's performance felt false. It was dramatic and emotional without crossing the line into melodrama or schmaltz. Very impressive for an actress who must have been around 9-10 years old or so when the movie was produced."

" One of the best movies I have seen so far
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,10,"There are numerous Hollywood movies of zombies and a very successful TV show. Some of them are great with mind-blowing action, CGI, stories and characters. Most of them revolves around a main character who comes in to save the day or teams up with characters who are used to further the story of the MC. To my relief, Train to Busan was nothing like that. This movie is about survival. This movie portrays what people are willing to do to save their loved ones when a crisis breaks out- a very shocking, unexpected and terrifying crisis. How the worst in people and also the best is exposed when people need to survive. It's not the most perfect movie. There are flaws and plot holes but you can easily overlook them with the excellent directing and acting. The director did an excellent job on expressing the intensity and the grim atmosphere for the story to fully grapple us. lastly, Hollywood movies could learn a thing or two on how to represent emotional, human side of the movie in a masterful way."
" More than a Zombie Movie and a Good One at That + History of Zombie
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,9,"(If you want to skip zombie pseudo-history, please go directly to the fourth paragraph for the film) Train to Busan (2016) is the ""best Zombie movie ever"" like a few reviews mentioned, but I am not a particular zombie movie fan. In fact I may have seen a dozen and do not watch The Walking Dead (2010) but do highly recommend ""Men Against Fire"" episode of British Black Mirror (2011) sci-fi TV series as a perfect example of social, philosophical, psychological and political warfare examination with a mutant premise, akin to zombie in some aspects. Korean anthology of short films Doomsday Book (2012) had ""A Brave New World"" segment that dealt with Seoul zombies in a thoughtful, sensitive way, while Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror (2007) film (segment of Grindhouse) was the best zombie movie before Train to Busan (2016). They surpass classics DAY OF THE DEAD (1985), 28 DAYS LATER (2002) and DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) but I haven't seen George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978) or his earlier NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968). Re-Animator (1985), Dead Alive (1992), Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Zombieland (2009) are supposed to be lots of fun. The Evil Dead (1981) and The Evil Dead II (1987) are excellently cheesy and gory and zombie-like enough to include here.Yet, from all these United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) productions, perfection of the craft within the genre has not been reached. Western origins of Zombies (Haitian voodoo) and Vampires (Eastern Europe) and popularization in the US and Western Europe has not allowed a fresh look at the genre (fresh flesh?). Now Asian cinema is taking things to the next level with its innovation and history with effective horror. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) and Jee-woon Kim's Coming Out (2001) are some example of the best Vampire tales every shown and they are from Iran and Korea.Train to Busan (2016) is a zombie film that is also a great action movie and a drama that holds its own weight. The characters are admittedly mostly one-dimensional but the dramatic action, moments, movements and details make it memorable and palpable. The main relationship is a failed father-daughter relationship that is fleshed out enough to be felt at many crucial moments of the film. Secondary characters are also important and contribute greatly to the narrative and emotions. The couple expecting a baby are the perfect counterpart to our main characters while other (regular or bizarre passengers, train personnel, baseball players) play adequate parts. The suspense is real even if you need some suspension of belief at many moments! This is an action-packed ride and expertly paced. The dilemmas are non-stop and drama keeps unfolding until the final frame. Zombies are scary and cool, the cinematography and special effects play well into the narrative. The tension is well created and the twists and turns keep on coming even if a few or far-fetched or questionable, the majority of the story is strong and holds together. More than anything this is a fun, fast and relentless ride with people we get to care about in an impossible situation after the other. What movies are made for, more or less. In this case: more!No reused Resident Evil (2002) profitable but predictably poor franchise here. I hope to also check out the animated work from the same director including a companion piece zombie movie set in Seoul..."
" Blows WWZ Out of the Water!!
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,10,"For me, this is one of THE BEST in the zombie genre. Fast paced, adrenaline pumping... plenty of ""jump"" moments... I'm yelling at the screen... Damn, what a ride. And it mostly takes place on a train. I thought this was better then World War Z by a mile. The entire movie was very well written; all the scenes fell into place. A very predictable ending but who the heck cares, it was that much fun!!! I very seldom buy movies but I want this one for my shelf."
" frantic. fast moving zombie film, with twists and style
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,10,"i loved this film, fast moving zombies, lots of biting, scary, had me shouting at the screen, ''run run run'', The train situation was great, as they are trapped, claustrophobic, and yet escape is possible,. All the actors did great job,some with comic aplomb. The little girl is an amazing actress. do admit in some places it slowed down, when you would think it would keep racing, with sentimental and melodramatic moments, i guessed these were Korean film culture.but they still added to the anxiety. This film takes zombie films forward,. further then zombie land did, it makes walking dead look amateur. i would recommend this film to anybody except maiden aunts and sissies"
" Very Cool
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,8,"Opinion about Train to Busan (2016) Train to Busan is a film of the year 2016. Directed by Sang-ho Yeon. Seok-woo (Yoo Gong) an entrepreneur goes on a train to base to see the mother of his daughter (Soo-an). But u zombie apocalypse to prevent them. Passing along with other people must survive on the train. What will? The movie in general I liked a lot. I was as usual with the theme of the zombies. But throughout the film increases the fear of the zombies. The movements of the zombies i found it very good, such as robotic to be transformed.Another important point of the film is the closeness that one has with the main characters, a don't know not how is called but just as you want it. And that is difficult to do. That closeness to the characters are shown in a trilogy, but here we only have one movie to love them.The deaths in the film seem to me to be sooooooooo unexpected, which gives a touch of surprise. Not as The Walking Dead, you say ""Not that cannot die because it is the protagonist"" here that doesn't happen. Anyone can die.What I liked the most of the film is the pace you take. From start to finish. Sitting quietly on the train, to be fighting against zombies. You should not take your eyes to the screen, because you will miss out on something incredible.What I found stupid in the movie, is that if the zombies don't see you don't eat. I found it ridiculous. But it gives a new twist to the movie, something more radical.I liked a lot 8/10"
" Excellent
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Train to Busan"" (2016) was hands down the most involving, intriguing, nail biting and visceral experience I've seen in many moons, considering this so called ""zombie"" genre. It has more in common with ""28 Days Later"" then G.Romero zombies and even ""World War Z"" influence is pretty obvious. But ""Train to Busan"" was by a moon better then ""World War Z"" - at running time 1 h 50 min. i wished it didn't ended and that happens rarely in movies these days. This is a superbly crafted picture from start till finish. The first ~50 min where nothing short of spectacular - great special effects, superbly constructed action / chase set piece at the station, clear character development and very clear and involving narrative. Second part of the film was just great - a nail biting horror / thriller. Overall, if you do like zombie movies - ""Train to Busan"" delivers goods - big time. This is one of the best if not the best example in this genre in some long time. I wasn't a sequel."
" One Step Before Awful
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,1,"I watched this movie in the 35th Fajr International Film Festival as part of a program called ""Shadows of Fear"" to promote horror movies in Iran. And it was just terrible! How people like it? The movies does not have any logic. It's not even terrifying; not even at one scene! People even laughed at some scenes, I remember! It is funny the way the movie wants to have dramatic and comic flavors while awfully trying to be terrifying. That was one of the worst movies I've ever watched at the theater!"
" An individualist Broker running away from zombies
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,7,"A typical American movie from the Korean's point of view, that's enough to pay my ticket. Beyond the zombie cinematic, and great and atypical action scenes, Train to Busan contains some critics to the western culture. In one of them It makes a critic to the individuality through the role of a Broker, a Korean in an typical American job, who fights for his only life and that of his daughter, forgetting the life of anybody else. Every man for himself or a sense of community. American perspective or Asian fellowship culture."
" Ruined By Melodramatic Nonsense
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,4,"No doubt, the production values were high for this film. They went out of their way to spend oodles of Won on special effects, blood, train wreckage, etc.The acting wasn't so bad, either. Boy, these zombies could movie.What sunk the film was the studio's (or director's) incessant interesting in wringing out as many melodramatic tears from their audience as they possibly could. In the end, it seems like the film was geared towards a specific audience - grandmothers who'd never seen a horror film, or any film, in their lives.After the end of this flick, if you're a casual moviegoer, you feel robbed, kinda like sitting through a movie you didn't know what just a commercial for Christianity or Scientology or whatever in the end. What a rip."
" More than any zombie movie
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,9,"Train to Busan is undoubtedly one of the best film of the genre, manages to mix Zombie with Drama very well with a little action, and it is the biggest proof that the Asian cinema is in its best phase, the plot obviously is nothing original, Always the thing about a virus, plus the idea of making a zombie movie where most of it goes on the Train is original and works great, and the characters are well built, the '' protagonist '' is a dumb face but His daughter changes him in the running of the movie, we have interesting characters, I like the character of Ma Donk-Seok too much, he is very funny, he has great dialogues, the makeup is well done, the rhythm is good, and the ending is a lot Well, I found it touching, I went to watch Train to Busan hoping for just one more generic movie, but I was very surprised.

" Even Korea isn't safe
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,8,"From zombies that is. Obviously if you're not into horror and/or zombies you probably shouldn't watch this. While it does also work as a drama (some of the best horror movies do), there is a lot of blood and a lot of violence. Just putting that out there (or should it be in there?). They also made an Anime as prequel to this. And while that is good in its own right (if you don't have an aversion against animated movies), you don't have to watch it beforehand.The acting is more than decent for a movie like this, but it is really a fast paced movie, so once it starts running, there is no real slowing down. Which is also true of the zombies. So if you're a ""purist"", you may take issue with that. I personally like the slow zombies myself too. It becomes more of an action movie, when they run. Having said that, when it's done as good as it is here, I don't mind either.South Korea is good when it comes to action, so that was kind of to be expected. If you had the opportunity to watch this on the big screen, good for you. But with home cinemas evolved there is enough to take and enjoy at home too. Best watch it with friends though, to get a vibe going"
" Make No Mistake - This Is The Greatest South Korean Zombie Apocalypse Film Ever Made.
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,10,"After having watched the superb film World War Z(2013), I was eager to watch more of the same. Years later I got a chance to see Train To Busan. The quality of the film matches World War Z in every respect. Train To Busan has a different setting to World War Z.The film is shot at a train station. Therefore all the action scenes are set inside and around trains. If you like films that are set on trains then you'll like this film. Examples are Murder on the Orient Express(1974), Narrow Margin(1990), Under Siege 2: Dark Territory(1995), Unstoppable(2010).The supporting cast is superb. Gong Yoo plays the central character of the film alongside a host of gifted actors. Ma Dong-seok is another talented actor. Kim Su-an does a wonderful performance as a child-actress.Note that this is a graphic horror film with intense scenes of gore. People who are new to this genre should perhaps see the trailer to the film before watching this one.There is a companion animated feature film to Train To Busan: Seoul Station, also directed by Sang-ho, was released less than a month later after the main film.Want to see more Zombie films?

" Hard to Think What to Title This, Its a Zombie Movie
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"Zombie movies are very samey,there is no denying this. There is rarely anything that strays from the zombie formula, rarely do you see anything but the immediate start of the outbreak or the recent aftermath. Train to Busan doesn't break from this tradition and doesn't bring anything new to the genre but what it does it does very well.The setting is perfect for a zombie outbreak, a confined space where there is nowhere to run but still provides better security than being outside. It makes the initial slaughter more plausible, the people that are immediately infected aren't just gawking as the first person is attacked, they're actually trapped and picked off in a domino effect. As they try to flee down the cramped isle, they are picked off by a constantly growing number of zombies until they could reach the relative safety of the next car only for it to fall to a similar fate. Its only when the front of the line manage to put some distance between them that they are able to secure themselves in the first class car. Since the train is almost constantly moving, they are safe from the zombies outside as it searches for safe haven but they can't just get rid of the zombies they have since they control the coupling. And when a small band of survivors are trapped in the rear, the train becomes an convincing gauntlet Te zombies themselves aren't much to look at, they are the usual bullet to the head zombies alas the Of The Dead series and there isn't much to differentiate them from normal people other than glassy eyes and possibly the injury that converted them so cosmetically they aren't the most interesting to look at. The outbreak was too recent to for them to undergo any purification so their makeup is minimal. In motion however they have a lot more going for them. They are quick when motivated and chase their prey with single minded determination but when left alone they meander about like they were in the Thriller video. It is kind of hokey but its seeing them get up more than makes up for it. Rather than just climbing to their feet they contort and twist their bodies until they're on their feat. The process is unnatural and unnerving to watch and is really all there is to set it apart from most zombie movies.Characters are done well but are pretty much what one would expect from the genre. Just about everyone fits into an archetypal role, the cowardly antagonist, the caring father, the too good daughter, the plucky young man and his girl, and the like. Everyone fits into two terms I could borrow from wrestling, the baby faces and the heels, and they fit them well. The faces are likable, even when they do have their faults they are genuinely good people and learn from them. You route for them and mourn when they fall short. The heels are detestable, they wallow in their inadequacy and are genuinely hate-able people that you feel glad when they receive their comeuppance. It is generally the response you would want from the audience, there aren't mixed messages that the hero is secretly a terrible person. And they drive one of the main themes of the movie home well, the sacrifice of the father for the good of the family.The downside, it falls for the same trappings as most zombie movies. I mentioned the gauntlet earlier, it is a great idea but with some thought it seems completely unnecessary. The small party were in a safe-ish part of the train, with a little work they should have been able to secure it better and just hunkered down. They could have even contacted the main party and given them updates on their situation, running the gauntlet only puts themselves at greater risk, had they just remained there almost all of the later deaths could have been avoided. But alas, it is a zombie movie and careful strategics has no place when suicidal pro-activity is an option."
" An infectious disaster movie
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,8,"The dead are rising and biting people, spreading panic and infection all across South Korea (and possibly the world) The main character is trapped on a train with his daughter headed for supposed safety.The zombies are of the fast-moving infected variety but with some very refreshing oriental twists. Once bitten the infected spring up with their limbs at unnaturally sharp angels, as if pulled up by strings like a marionette.Although this is a zombie movie it has heavy elements of the old 1970's disaster movies I was bought up on. There are some very clear stereotypes who tend to act out according to role. All the characters are forced together in a restricted environment and its not long before zombies become everyone's second biggest problem.I have seen a million zombies films, I tend to like each one less than the previous but this was the exception.You are one step ahead of the story most of the way but that didn't ruin my enjoyment.Think ""Day of the Dead"" meets ""Towering Inferno"" with a pinch of ""The Grudge"""
" This is a masterpiece
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,9,"If Hollywood ever decides to remake this title my advice to the audience is clear: DON'T BOTHER! It has been a while since i saw a really good movie. A movie that can compete for the 20 best or so list but Train to Busan not only made me smile it also impressed me on many levels. It's without a doubt the best modern zombie movie since 28 days later. The story and the script are well crafted and the characters are likable just like in 28 days later. The zombies are running, thank god.7 seasons with the walking dead has not only nearly bored me to death it has also made me realize how important it is that zombies in a zombie flick are really frightening and not some stupid dead meat you can whack half sleeping. The zombies and the effects in Train to Busan have the touch of a major studio production, which in itself of course is not a guarantee for success. Who doesn't remember the miserable effects in I am legend? Also 28 days later did not have a particularly big budget but succeeded anyway, so its not about the money, rather the quality, and the quality in TTB is top notch. The zombie-crowd scenes for instance feels more believable and well made compared with World War Z even though the comparison is not 100% since the zombie crowd-scenes in WWZ were massively crowded.I can't find many weak points even the music appears in the right places and adds something, especially at the end when the story takes a sad turn. The only minus comes with the choice of a train as the center piece of the story. On the surface TTB shows similarities with a movie like Flight of the living dead. But the zombies on a plane - zombies on a train duality is just a play with words. The comparison of the two films is unfair. With splendid actors and more complex layer of emotions TTB has ambitions other than to make you laugh. Despite the unsexy choice of playground TTB is running for 1.57 and you won't even notice. Just another sign of how good this bad-ass Korean zombie film is."
" Sad and scary. More than what someones expect from a zombie movies
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"One of the best zombie movies. I highly recommend it to all the people. End was sad, hated the bad guy. Interesting, thrilling since the beginning. Koreans are brilliant. Love korean movies and drama. I hope they make more zombies movies. It wasn't just some Zombies movies but also a good family."
" This works extraordinarily well as an action flick with a heart.
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,9,"First, let me say that I am not a fan of the zombie genre. World War Z was okay, I thought. The Walking Dead bored me.This Korean movie will likely (like Oldboy) get a US remake so the snowflakes who are upset by subtitles will get to see a Hollywoodized version at some point in the future. No doubt the plot will be changed through committee interference. In this movie, our protagonist isn't the most likable person... and don't expect Hollywood to leave his character arc untouched.Enjoy this one in its present form. It does an excellent job with a growing feeling of dread that turns into an all out chase film with twists and surprising script decisions. Some old character stereotypes are worked in, but there are plenty of unexpected turns and clever solutions.Like The Host, another Korean film I particularly like, there's family drama at the core. But it doesn't overwhelm the sheer ferocity of the action."
" Great stuff for such a tired genre
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,8,"A rather neglectful father is taking his daughter by train to visit her mother on the day the zombie apocalypse hits. Naturally zombies get on the train and all hell breaks loose. ""Zombies on a train"" doesn't sound like the most original concept, but writer/director Sang Ho-Yeon not only manages to find interesting things to do with it, he rather effortlessly stretches it out to 2 hours of really intense action ... and he works in some interesting character dynamics too. There's nothing startling here, but it's not predictable and it's actually rather difficult to predict who will live and who will die. Great stuff especially for a really tired genre."
" WWZ... in Korea!
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"This flick could be during the WWZ universe, but in another place, South Korea. The zombies behave just like the WWZ zombies. Bite you, 1-2 mins later, depending on the severity of your injuries, and you are a fast running, hyper-athletic flesh eater, pulsating in crowds fighting over each other to get at the living flesh in a undead wave.Other than the characteristics of the zombies, the movie is quite different from the aforementioned title. The scope is contained to a relatively small band of survivors, trapped on a high-speed train from NW Seoul to SW Busan during the onset of an outbreak.The scope of the movie concentrates on a 30-something fund manager and his neglected 10-yo daughter, on their way to visit her mother and his ex-wife. Begrudgingly, he accepts this journey in an effort to please his daughter on her birthday, a day in which he gives her the same present he gave her last year. Much tears and reflection sets up the strain between the two and his later efforts to redeem himself.From here, all hell breaks loose. An infected passenger soon turns the bulk of the passengers on the train into zombies, in a scene very reminiscent of the WWZ airplane scene. The end result is the survivors desperately trying to survive in the enclosures between the train-cars.Like any good disaster movie, just when you think it can't get worse, it does. That is as far as I will go with the plot, to avoid spoilers.So, I loved the movie, but it requires you to not think about the logic too much, if you know anything about Korea. The fact that the infection spreads faster than a speeding train. That no guns or military presence is available, despite the fact that every Korean male is required to serve in the military for X number of years. For most western audiences, they won't notice and it doesn't detract from the fun.A++"
" Surprisingly Great
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"I have to say that we generally avoid movies with sub-titles and Asian films. We want to watch the movie, not read the sub-titles and most Asian films do not make sense to me because of the cultural differences. Train to Busan had both these as strikes against it, yet for some reason, we decided to give it a shot, fully expecting to hate it and have another selection going in short time. Boy were we wrong!! About fifteen minutes into the movie, the main characters had been introduced, the stage set and the roller-coaster started heading down the first hill. And a roller-coaster ride it was. We were on the edge of our seats: anxious, happy, sad, shocked, the full gamut of emotions.This is a zombie film, but it is an intelligent zombie film. The director does not resort to cheap gags and scenes that all of the zombie films now-a-days fall prey to. In many respects, it reminded me of World War Z and very well could have occurred in the same universe.Sang-ho Yeon, who also wrote the screenplay, did an amazing job with direction. He gave the film depth and subtle levels.Yoo Gong and Soo-an Kim, who play the father and daughter respectively, were so believable in their roles. The majority of the cast deserve praise for their work: you hate who you should hate, you like who you should like you change opinions about the ones you should change your minds about. But it does go beyond the simple classification of ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"".Whether you like zombie movies or just a good ""who lives, who dies"" film, give this little gem a shot. You will be surprised."
" Wow. Just wow!
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,10,"This is my first review on here, and I was so blown away by this film that I just had to come on here right after viewing it to share my experience! First off, all I can say is WOW! My heart is still racing and I still have tears in my eyes (and I honestly RARELY cry in response to any film)! The characters are so well-developed and right from the beginning (and literally to the very LAST moment of the film) I genuinely felt for these characters and felt like I was actually with them, experiencing a huge range of emotions from fear to sadness to even some funny moments, all which are very sincere and portrayed by top- notch acting. I'm so tired of all the bad, cheesy, cheap movies on Netflix, but after reading so many great reviews of this film I decided to give it a try - and boy am I impressed! This is not your typical zombie film - Hollywood, please take note of this - THIS IS HOW A ZOMBIE MOVIE should be! It explores so much more than just ""zombies"" - it shows what is at the core of humanity and society; it explores ethics and what people will do in a crisis and to fight til the end to survive - all without going too deep or being too corny. The cinematography is incredible and the acting is really what blew me away - especially the little girl - I admit she won my heart and I was crying along with her at the end when her father sacrifices himself for her and the pregnant woman. If a film can truly make its audience care so much for its characters like this film does (kudos to the director!), it ups the tension even more and we feel a true connection to these characters - WOW! That is a RARE but fabulous thing! Please watch this movie - even people who don't like ""zombie"" movies will love it - perfect mix of horror, drama, and suspense! I love how the director used a very claustrophobic atmosphere and whittled it down to being even more claustrophobic - amazing! You will not be disappointed! I was glued to the screen the entire time while watching this! The best zombie movie ever - and don't let the subtitles turn you off - it is not overly dialogue heavy and the subtitles do not distract from the film! What a thrill ride! I'm still on the edge of my seat! So impressive, especially it being a foreign film - that might turn some people off but give it a try - you will not be disappointed! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I'm a huge horror junkie and it is a rare thing to have a horror film affect me so much - but this is more than just a ""horror"" film - it connects its audience with its characters in such a way that you actually feel like you are on this train to Busan right along with them! I can honestly say that I felt cramped, claustrophobic, and on the edge of my seat the entire time watching this (and I admit I LOVED it! What a ride)! I'm just so overly happy that I finally found an amazing film on Netflix! ""Train to Busan"" is by far the best film I've seen this past year! Simply blown away. :-D"
" Excellent Zombie movie
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,I am a big fan of South Korean Movies...not so much Zombie movies of any kind... I took a chance on watching this one. It was EXCELLENT it will make you jump in your chair at times and screaming RUN at the TV. This is a must watch movie!The movie is well acted and the zombies are very well played by the actors... you wont be disappointed.
" The best since Dawn of the Dead - remake
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,9,"The first big budget zombie flick from South Korea. ""Train to Busan"" is terrific.Starting slowly like most zombie movies (something is wrong) it takes off and does not stop until (SPOILER ALERT) almost all the main characters have been dispatched. This is non stop action and excitement for almost the entire 2 hours. Just when the zombie genre is on life support (""The Walking Dead "" Season 7 is dying and killing all of us in the process), the Koreans have shown that there still is life in the genre.There are several new elements: (SPOILER ALERT II) most of the action takes place on a train; the heroes have to fight and trick their way to other survivors; the zombies are terrific - a lot of weird jerking around (reminiscent of the priest in the opening scenes of ""28 Days Later""); lots of zombies cascading through windows and falling over each other; an amazing train escape sequence you have to see; and numerous other very creative takes on the ""Zombie chasing humans"" device.But this is more than just wild zombie action. This is a story about self interest; caring for others; being willing to help; a father's redemption with his daughter, and the struggle between good and evil (naturally.)I have not enjoyed a zombie flick in many years - this one makes my all time top 10.If you are a fan of the genre, this one is a must see. You will have a blast."
" Fantastic!
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,8,"I saw this movie listed on Netflix and had never heard of it before. But as someone who has watched hundreds of zombie movies and am a huge zombie fanatic, I thought I'd give this movie a chance. The last few years of watching zombie movies I have been disappointed with them. But this movie was absolutely fantastic! I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys zombie movies. Just watching this movie last night I have recommended it to several people."
" Full Bore Zombie Frenzy
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,8,"I know. I know. If you are anything like me, you are sick to death of zombie movies. Many will rise to defend the sub-genre of horror. After all, there are only so many tropes and monsters that you can explore. In the same breath, one could say you are tired of vampire movies or ghost movies, but the fact is that I would say I am tired of all three. Maybe ""tired"" isn't the right word. I am skeptical. I have seen the originals that created the structures, the next wave of zombie films that re-defined what you could do with it, then every twist on the genre directors could come up with, from comedies like SHAUN OF THE DEAD to dramatic presentations like MAGGIE. Mostly, I am tired of every indie film maker with no better idea then to do a zombie flick devoid of imagination. So, it really takes a lot to impress me at this point, which makes it all the more surprising that TRAIN TO BUSAN is able to do just that.There are two major things that make this movie work incredibly well, the action and the characters. The action elements of this movie is what will get it attention from the largest segment of audience. The fact that this is the first live-action film for the director is even more impressive. He cut his teeth in animation and it definitely shows. The movie has a kinetic sense of action and pacing that is straight out of an action cartoon. The movie feels almost like a comic book or cartoon come to life, in many ways. I could make many bad train puns here, but the movie feel like a ride on a steam train. It starts off slow and plodding, setting up the story, the characters and the angles and the movie slowly picks up more and more speed, until arriving at a fever pitch towards the end. That action is gripping and once it hooks you in, it doesn't let go. You will be on the edge of your seat as the movie takes you for a ride.I said, earlier, that the action would hook the largest audience. Plenty of people just want an action-packed film and there is nothing wrong with that, but I know my friends in the horror intelligentsia will want a little something more on their plates, and this movie does not fail to deliver in character. The plot is pretty straight forward, zombies on a train, but what makes the movie really special is the characters. The plot revolves around a workaholic dad who agrees to take his young daughter to see his ex- wife. We see that the two have a very strained relationship, which naturally evolves through the course of the film. Along the way, we pick up additional characters. There is the drifter that portends the action and plays a pivotal part. The tough bruiser and his pregnant wife, who are important pieces in the relationships that will develop and prove to be much deeper than they appear in the surface. There is an a*hole businessman, who will sacrifice anyone to save himself. To a less defined degree, the baseball player and the girl who wants to be his girlfriend, who aren't as fleshed out as other characters, but provide a few interesting scenes.Many zombie purists will not like the direction of the zombies themselves. At the risk of incurring the endless, tired debate of which are the best zombies, you could argue these aren't zombies, at all. They are ""infected"". They are much closer to rabid, chaotic horde of the DAWN remake, or more so, WORLD WAR Z, than the shambling undead of the original DAWN OF THE DEAD, or even THE WALKING DEAD. That last comparison is an interesting one. For all the people on social media complaining that the popular show is too slow, too boring, too talkative and there isn't enough focus on the zombies, this is almost the antidote. Full of action and full of zombies.The movie has two big things going against it for a western audience, it's sub-titled and it's another zombie film. For that reason alone, many will avoid it. They would be doing themselves a big disservice as this movie is one of the best of last year and a great modern zombie flick."
" A Zombie movie like no other.....
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,9,"Train to busan looks the usual zombie flick...with a normal zombie movie plot line...where it scores is it makes us feel for the characters within no time...Director keeps us guessing until the final minute of the film..which is no easy feat...Underlying social commentary in the film adds to the story...zombies are not the scariest things in this movie...humans are more scarier basing on the decisions they make...It has gripping screenplay...and all the usual zombie flick stuff like... near misses, blood and gore, stupid decisions characters take( i hate it when they do that)....What is different is..zombies are super fast...(like world war z) No mention about the incident which made zombies( for a change, i liked it)Above all its a film about a father and his daughter...A zombie film with a surprising emotional connect....Must watch....its not what you expect..itz better.."
" It definitely deserves it's enormous Box Office success, and it's rave reviews.
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,9,"'TRAIN TO BUSAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A South Korean zombie apocalypse horror flick, about passengers on a train to Busan that are trying to survive a zombie outbreak. It was directed by Yeon Sang-ho (who's only previous experience is in writing and directing animated horror and thriller movies), and it was written by Park Joo-suk. The film stars Gong Yoo, Kim Su-an, Jung Yu-mi, Kim Eui-sung and Ma Dong-seok. It's received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics, and it was a blockbuster at the international Box Office (breaking multiple records). I really enjoyed it as well.Seok-woo (Yoo) is a divorced fund manager who's obsessed with his job and has made little time for his young daughter, Soo-ann (Su- an), in recent years. Seok-woo has promised to take Soo-ann to Busan, to see her mother, but of course things don't go as planned. A zombie outbreak spreads throughout the train, and seemingly everywhere in the area. Seok-woo, and his daughter, must work together with other passengers on the train, to survive the trip and hopefully make it somewhere safe. At the same time Seok-woo tries to prove to his daughter what a good father he can still really be (by becoming a badass zombie fighter).The film has some great special effects, and awesome (brutal) zombie action scenes. It's a great dark horror movie, with biting social commentary on the battle of the rich verses the poor (despite how cheesy it might sound). It's also a surprisingly emotional character study, with a pretty diverse (and well developed) group of characters. The film is a lot of fun, it's satisfying to horror fans, and it's even got some decent drama in it (and acting). I think it definitely deserves it's enormous Box Office success, and it's rave reviews.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Y0XE5jyxMFQ"
" The best zombie movie I have ever seen !!
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,9,"I rated 9 this movie because it is totally worth it !! I have seen it last night and for those that haven't seen it yet you have to see it because like the title of my review says , it really is the best zombie movie I have ever seen . Korean producers please make another epic movie like this one !! I love it so much and I have to warn people that his movie has a powerful emotional impact ! If your heart is sensible than be prepared to cry a lot ! Can someone please recommend me some more Korean movies like this one ?"
" Spoilers follow ...
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,7,"This begins with one of the best pre-credit scenes I've seen in a while, featuring a deer knocked down and apparently killed by a flustered van driver. Moments later, the crumpled body in the road judders back into life, struggling to stand. As it does so, we see its eyes – dead and milky. The creature has joined the ranks of the living dead! Next we meet sulking child Soo-an (Kim Su-an), who is upset because her father Seok-woo (Gong Yoo) works all the time and spends no time with her. I have a problem with this kind of thing, and other similar scenes in other films. Perhaps the child would be less brattish if the parents gave up work and instead of a WII (or two) to play with, she had a stick and a clementine. Hardly! ""Dads get all the bad rap and no praise,"" says big soft husband Sang-hwa (Dong-seok Ma) at one stage. Seok-woo, however, has his own story to tell  Anyway, this distant father and child are but two passengers who board the train to Busan, amid news reports of violence and rioting in the streets, and also a wayward passenger exhibiting symptoms of a strange and deadly disease.And we're off. Whilst the rapid transformations of many passengers into zombies relies perhaps too heavily on the actors' facial mannerisms and comes across often as 'over-enthusiastic' acting, there's no denying the effect of an enclosed body of people reverting into killers in some tensely choreographed scenes.My favourite character might well be Michael Ripper-like Yon-suck (Kim Eui-sung), self-serving CEO who does everything, and betrays everyone, in order to survive amidst the spitting, fast-moving zombie creatures. In one of my favourite scenes, the ringtone of a mobile phone in another carriage is used to successfully deflect the attentions of the ravenous pack. Watching them charging as one toward the source of the sudden, tinny music, is very effective.Every possible drop of tension is wrung out into the running time. For a while whilst watching 'Last Train to Busan', I felt there was something holding it back from greatness. Brilliant direction, acting and urgent pacing – however, I couldn't get completely immersed in it. And then, somewhere along the way, that changed and I was hooked. The tension is impossible to resist. What a journey!"
" Wow- Great Movie, hands down!
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen, and I am proud to say I've seen over 95% of what's out there.The cinematography is top notch, even somewhat overwhelming at times (wait until you see the zombies tumbling over each other). Frankly, I've never seen a better representation.Loved the cast, the character ""Sang-hwa"" is my favorite (he's AWESOME), but not by much -- I really loved the entire cast.Stay until the end, it's worth it."
" Utterly entertaining
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,7,"Train to Busan is an uber-entertaining action-packed, not-a-minute-of-rest Zombie Korean movie. No time to get bored, the zombies are like rats coming out of nowhere, with a healthy appetite for human flesh, and our heroes are bunch of normal good people stuck on the carriages of a train heading to the city of Busan.I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which has nothing to envy to any of Hollywood zombie movies. The film might pass as an American film except for the message, because the message is definitely not Anglo-Saxon culture is Asian culture - individualism sucks, you care and you take care of your people, your don't just look after yourself, that is egotistical and inhumane. You are an hero for the love of your people not a hero per se. On the other hand, as always happens on this sort of movies, one questions who is more savage, the zombies, who became so against their will, or the humans not infected treating other human beings inhumanly out of suspicion.The actors are good in their roles but the beautiful girl Soo-An Kim is really the best of the lot. Her face is uber-beautiful, but without her mix of innocence and her dramatic qualities as an actress the film would have not worked or been so impacting. One really believes that what is happening to her is real. I also loved Yumi-Jung as the pregnant fragile Seong-kyeong, and Eui-sung Kim is excellent as the quintessential baddie Yon-suk.The main downside of the film is not what is in the film, but what is not in it. What was the origin of this zombie outbreak and how was controlled? That is never properly explored or explained. I could forgive the first question, but the second I thought it was unavoidable. Original? No. Good, Yes. Entertaining? Very. Satisfying, just partially."
" One of the most unique Zombie movies ever
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,8,"When I first heard of this, I sighed. Now Zombies on a train? But this is a really different film that shows the best and worst of humanity while trying to survive. When an outbreak of violence starts sweeping South Korea, A father (who has little time for her) and his daughter are, with others including a working man and his pregnant wife, a High School Baseball team and a CEO (the one stereotype in the movie) on a train. Before the train can leave, an injured woman staggers on. As the trains pulling out we see others attacked on the platform. For now the travelers are blissfully unaware... This is anything but an average zombie movie. Some may compare it to 28 Days Later (but those weren't zombies, they were infected and living). The zombies in this are unique in ways that I won't give away. They share more of a kinship with the terrible World War Z (this is a hundred times better)in their swarming ways. I would have thought that a movie set nearly entirely on a train would be slow, possibly boring - but it's not. Between moving at breakneck speed, this movie is claustrophobic and creepy. Well worth seeing."
" Moar sombeez
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"A dead-beat dad is forced to choose his daughter over his work, but as they settle into their train journey a zombie sneaks aboard ...Bit of a plod as it sets up the emotional stuff, but once the action gets going the story never lets up. This is much better than Snowpiercer, and conveys the zombie satire of society every bit as well as Romero. Plus the emotional moments are truly good. Plenty of humour, but no laughs for me - all in the translation, except the final scene was crying out for a close up on the sniper's face as he heard the singing.Performances are good, with an impressive turn by the little girl.Music, editing - good. And the pile-on effects with zombie corpses were effective.Overall: Good zombiness."
" Zombie horror masterwork from Korea
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,8,"South Korea has made plenty of horror films over the last couple of decades, but very few of them have been zombie films; the country typically favours ghost or psycho tales like WHISPERING CORRIDORS or I SAW THE DEVIL. That changes with TRAIN TO BUSAN, a Hollywood-feel film that owes more than a debt of inspiration to WORLD WAR Z in its depiction of fast, feral zombies that amass into a CGI-animated crowd on occasion.This film is straightforward enough, with a simple premise: zombies on a train. And yet it also happens to be thoroughly gripping, exciting, and indeed excellent, thanks to the skill of director Yeon Sang-ho who is known for his animated features like KING OF PIGS. The reason this film succeeds where others fail is down to the characterisation, which is superb for a straight horror tale. The characters are realistic, well-drawn, and appealing, and there's plenty of sentiment while at the same time the film narrowly avoids falling into melodrama.This is a visceral journey that has the viewer on the edge of his or her train seat for much of the running time. It starts off eerie and foreboding and then builds a momentum that never flags right up until the end. The CGI effects are pretty good although occasionally weak, but that doesn't matter a jot when everything else is so well portrayed. The actors impress as always in Korea, putting tons of energy and heart into their performances, and as an action-horror film this is difficult to surpass. I enjoyed every moment."
" Train to Busan Review: An impressive action thriller with surprisingly amazing display of emotions!
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,10,"Movie: Train to Busan (A) (Why, CBFC India?)Rating: 5/5To be very honest, I had never watched a zombie film in my entire life. I had heard about such films and also realized that mostly Hollywood produces such films. TRAIN TO BUSAN is an exceptional addition not just to the list of the best zombie apocalypse action thriller, but also to the list of best films of world cinema which portray human emotions in the most realistic and heart-touching way possible. Yes, it's that excellent. TRAIN TO BUSAN is the first South Korean film to have a wide theatrical release in India. That attracted too. It was released in India in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. I watched the film first in Korean with English subtitles, and then in Hindi. And I realized that the film manages to convey its message and make you reciprocate emotionally for the film, whether you watch the dubbed version or the original version. The Hindi dubbing was good enough to add to the positive feel.The art South Korean filmmakers know is how to add an emotional feel to different genres. Thus, TRAIN TO BUSAN is no exception as it makes you feel for every character. Gong Yoo takes his performance to a higher level and raises the bar for world cinema actors in the climax. He is extremely likable and excellent. Ma Dong-seok is brave, lively and energetic too. Jung Yu-mi impresses big time with her beautiful & emotionally active character. Kim Su-an is cute & impresses with her strong act in sequences which one can't expect from a child artist of her age. Other actors too deliver performances great enough to make you care for them. The film's scale is big, and the visual effects are amazing. Cinematography is excellent and captures the locales & thrilling action sequences with plenty of intrigue, while also succeeding in sending chills down your spine through the emotional sequences. Thankfully, it's not an Indian film, otherwise filmmakers won't have rested without adding songs & unnecessary romance. Whatever you see in the film, looks very, very realistic. The tension is very well built and neither do you deviate from enjoying the film, nor does the film deviate from storytelling. The story and screenplay are both excellent, and the editing is excellent. The only thing that disappointed me was the A certificate given to it by the Indian Censor Board called CBFC. Why? No nation of the world gave this film an 18+ rating except India & Malaysia. Leave Malaysian Certification system because they follow equal rules for all films Irrespective of the target audience. But in India, films with dozens of gory violence & bucket loads of vulgarity get a UA (PG) certificate. TRAIN TO BUSAN is a clean family entertainer despite the A certificate it has been subjected to. But it's not a mistake of the makers, so there was no flaw I found in the film.Overall, TRAIN TO BUSAN is a must watch film for any movie enthusiast. Irrespective of language and nation barriers, the film deserves to be watched by one and all. And yes, I forgot to tell. This film was the first one that actually made me cry. No film before had compelled me to shed tears, but this film did. Even the emotionless will emote. Such strong is this film. Go, watch it with your family and enjoy it fully, along with respecting the safe life we have from zombies in reality."
" Overrated Korea
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,6,"""28 Days later"", ""28 Weeks Later"", and both George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead""and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (And also Zack Snyder's remake) – these are the great movies of the horror-zombie genre; although we could all agree that Romero started it all. Then in 2016, in the south of Korea, we got another zombie flick. I can't tell on how this movie was being received worldwide, but here in Singapore, the 'praises' for it is a bit overdone in my opinion. The result is predictable as neo-musical genre 'K-POP' is popular here. So, any entertainment that shows intimacy with the mentioned phenomenon, will get extra attention.A young fund manager (Gong Yoo) agrees to bring his daughter (Kim Su-an) to Busan to visit her mother. Since the child's parents are separated, I assume the two parties occasionally meet one another. From the start to the point upon the boarding of the train for Busan, the movie is well made. 'Zombies' in norm only needs one infected for the thrill to start. Hence, in ""Train to Busan"" an infected manages to secretly board the train.Director Yeon Sang-ho's effort in exploiting small details can easily be admired. The images of emergency vehicles, the all- encompassing violent fires at the near top of a building and ashes steadily settling down from it – all allow audiences to sense something unsound had happened, although we all know that it is the omnipresent of zombie outbreak.That's it. After the first zombie begins to bite, the movie goes into a nosedive motion. Action sequences are surprisingly bland; I cannot specifically describe on what's lacking but it lacks genuine excitement. The writing for the characters too shares the same fate (especially the villain) as they are clichéd. What ""Train to Busan"" tried to depict on the 'colours' of its characters had already been done by dozens of movies before; worst when it lays out that idea before our very eyes and never challenges the audiences. And visual style is straight terrible. The only element which remains to be positive is the effective use of suspense throughout the movie.As a zombie-genre fan, I quickly got for myself a ticket to experience it at the cinema but only to leave the hall feeling disappointed. My criticism does not mean I abhor Korean movies. Movie fans in general would know that Koreans had made great films for the past years. One of them is ""I Saw the Devil"" by Kim Jee- Woon, which is a masterpiece in any way. But unfortunately this ""Train to Busan"" is vastly overrated.Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com"
" Run of the mill
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,6,"Some characters die from order of appearance, which is quite predictable. It had a few cheap tear jerkers, like the vulnerable pregnant woman and child losing their loved ones to zombies, Very clichè. The movie tried to send a moral message across to its audience with the main protagonist shown to be a selfish prick at first, but as the film progresses he learns throughout his horrific train ride that he needs to be a caring father. A strange message for a zombie movie I thought. Of course the zombies aren't the only bad guys, as some of the living can be dicks too and they're the ones who get everyone killed whilst getting killed themselves. The last scene was kind of like watching night of the living dead. Overall formulaic and predictable, but fun watch. If you're a hardcore zombie lover, then don't bother, If you've never seen a zombie movie in your life, then you will love this."
" A+ Action thriller til the end from very early on.
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,10,"Incredible thriller from very early on til the end of the movie. I had heard good things about the movie, so I had to see it for myself. The movie has a bit of a spooky start to it. If you're wanting to go see a happy go lucky or romantic movie, this is NOT it. However, if you're looking for an action thriller that won't stop til the end, this is it. The funny thing is that this movie also has a incredibly sentimental, heart-breaking scene. Suffice it to say that one of the messages of the movie is to spend more time with your kids. Because the day may come when you're unable to spend time with them, even if you wanted to. If you're a father, it REALLY pulls at your heartstrings...."
" All aboard!
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,7,"Yoo Gong plays Seok Woo, a workaholic father who hasn't been enough of a presence in his daughter Soo-ans' (Soo-an Kim) life. Still, when she yearns for a trip to visit her mother, he agrees, determined to do right by her for a change. But the journey by train is like a sprint through Hell, as an undetermined virus is infecting SCORES of Korean people. It's up to a select few, including father and daughter, to survive and make it to Busan, which is supposedly something of a safe zone.""Train to Busan"" is sometimes cartoonish and over the top, and does go on longer than is really necessary. The amount of time it takes for the virus to infect a bitten person varies depending on the needs of the screenplay. And writer / director Sang-ho Yeon isn't averse to succumbing to genre clichés, such as the one cowardly individual who will throw others to the wolves in order to buy himself more time. Fortunately, the director serves up a satisfying smorgasbord of carnage, and often gets by on pure showmanship. He also makes sure that the scenario retains its humanity, never letting the horror get completely out of control. His characters may sometimes be ridiculous, but he does give us some heroes for whom we can root. The performances range from reasonably sturdy to frenzied, and as a leading character Seok is a little unconventional, because he actually teaches his daughter to always look out for # 1 first, rather than be compassionate.Pretty slick filmmaking and generous doses of gore help to keep this from ever getting boring, plus Dong-seok Ma (the expectant husband Sang Hwa) is a fairly amusing badass type of guy.Seven out of 10."
" In the vein of 28 Days Later -- a great ""zombie"" movie
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"This is a seriously GOOD movie! You really need to watch this movie if you are into zombie flicks in the vein of ""28 Days Later""! I am not well versed in the S. Korean movie industry, however, if this is any indication of future offerings I will be watching a lot of Korean flicks. I don't like watching movies by subtitles but in this movie it didn't hinder the quality or the suspension of reality at all! --- As I said before, this movie is in the vein of 28 Days Later, which was, in my opinion, the first and best modern age zombie flick since the original ""Night Of The Living Dead"" way back in 1968. I give props to NOTLD because it was the first, but I never liked the premise of those movies, in that they try to tell the watcher that something can actually bring you back from actual death. I am sorry but to my sciences oriented mind that just does not work. However, a plague that turns humans into homicidal psychopathic lunatics is believable in my mind. In fact there are actual examples of such things in nature right now. There are fungi that literally attack an insect's brain and turn insects into zombies that do their bidding in infecting others and moving to the best place for the fungus to send out its spores and such. So 28 Days Later really worked for me and so does ""Train to Busan""! And the acting in the movie was great too, especially from the little girl. I have to admit at first I thought this was another Japanese SciFi flick, but after 5 minutes into the movie it hit me that this wasn't Japanese. If this is an example of the S.Korean film industry to come Japan had better get better and fast or just step aside because S. Korea is in the house."
" Bloody"" awesome! # 1 zombie movie , must see
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"The best zombie film I've seen in a long time. With its ultra fast piling over each other infected undead it is more in the style of World War Z than TV's The Walking Dead and also does not have the latter's extreme gore. There is enough blood and violence so it is not too light for a hardened zombie fan but focuses more on tension and action. It also managed to build up the characters so I cared about them and once that happens the tension stakes are that much higher. The main characters are a business man and his young daughter on a train when a zombie apocalypse begins. Death while infected causes people to instantly turn so one infected girl on the train causes the infection to spread like wildfire and very soon two groups of survivors remain, separated by infected carriages. Edge of the seat tension and many action set pieces follow as the smaller group tries to get to the front of the train and things escalate in all sorts of ways with some unexpected turns, big action, all building to a powerful climax. I loved it and was gripped from start to finish, I'm a big zombie fan and it did not disappoint. It's serious in tone and has some great character drama with some decent arcs and things play out in ways that have just a slight spin against Western expectations. The zombies are really well done, not too heavily made up (they're fresh) but they move well, all twitchy and sometimes freaky spasms, very fast and lethal. It is Korean language with subtitles but is not dialogue heavy. The DVD also includes behind the scenes footage and 2 trailers for the director's forthcoming Seoul Station which is a cartoon that appears part of this same undead world."
" Action-Packed Zombies - Heavy-Handed Storyline
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,6,"There are good and bad things about ""Train to Busan"". It's a claustrophobic zombie movie that makes the most of having its protagonists trapped on a speeding train with a horde of ravenous zombies.It doesn't milk that situation of being trapped quite as effectively as ""REC"" but the action sequences are spectacular and the zombie attacks are very well-staged.Other reviewers have praised the social satire element of the film. Hmm... I found it might have worked better if it were not laid on with a trowel. The ""douche"" fund-manager, the evil executive who just NEVER MISSES an opportunity to screw someone over. I found it painfully sentimental at times and ""Yes, I get it"" obvious at others.At this moment in history, when the rich and powerful are turning us against each other in order to further their own interests we do need films with messages like this. And on the whole I enjoyed ""Train to Busan"" more than I didn't. But if there is to be remake, I do hope the film-makers allow for a little more subtlety in there."
" zombie express
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,10,"Another zombie movie? Yes, and Yeon Sang-ho's ""Busanhaeng"" (""Train to Busan"" in English) is a cool one. The plot involves a zombie apocalypse overrunning South Korea, while a group of train passengers tries to contain the infected passengers. Just as most zombie movies give their living dead unique attributes, this one does: the zombies can't see in the dark, so they have to rely on their hearing (meaning that the living can sneak past silently when the train passes through tunnels).It's not a masterpiece, but fun. I suspect that it's fun to play zombies, or whatever the infected people are supposed to be. The subplot about the absentee father and his daughter trying to reconnect gave the movie a more human side than most zombie movies out there. I hope that Yeon continues making movies like this."
" All aboard the feels train
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,10,"If I had to describe this movie with one word, it would've been tremendous. I was eating a sandwich at the beginning of the movie but as it progressed I got so engaged that I forgot to eat it. Get ready for an action packed thriller. We've all watched Hollywood zombie movies but this movie just takes it to another level. I myself am not specifically a fan of Korean movies myself but this movie is worth watching. The pacing of the movie was a bit slow in the beginning but as the movie progressed it went from zero to hero real quick. As you watch the movie you bond with different types of characters which in my opinion, all of them represent a specific person in society. Eg. the businessman represents the guy who works a lot, gains a lot of money and thinks he is above all. The husband of the pregnant women; the guy who is always a bit humorous and would sacrifice himself for the sake of others. The father is also the person who works his butt off but is always a bit selfish. But as always he/she realises what he/she has done and regrets his choices in his past. Towards the end of the movie everybody probably smirked at the death of COO of the train company. But also, when the father tried saving his daughter and the pregnant women, he got bit. As the girl started crying ""father don't leave me"", I admit I cried too.I would watch it again although I know the plot."
" The best zombie movie ever made so far
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,10,"There have been numerous stereotypical, repetitive and gruesome zombie movies since the beginning of the millennium and now South Korea has officially jumped on the bandwagon... and revolutionized the entire genre with the very best movie of its kind.""Train to Busan"" convinces on every single level. The settings are diversified and very well chosen and the gripping atmosphere is pushed forward by the idea of a few random passengers being caught on a train with a horde of zombies. The cinematography is perfectly balanced between intense close-ups and larger angles. There are almost no shaky camera passages as opposed to the disappointing contemporary Hollywood standard. The story finds the right path between brutal intensity and great acting skills. The film is never slowing down and highly intriguing from the very first until the very last scene.What really makes this zombie movie stand out even compared to the better genre flicks is the depth and diversity of the intriguing characters that are perfectly portrayed by skilled actresses and actors. We get to meet a busy and divorced hedge fund manager and his estranged daughter who is desperately trying to get his attention. We follow the actions of a tough, honest and brave working-class man and his more serious pregnant wife. We are introduced to two old sisters with an intense connection who are inseparable. We meet a naive cheerleader and the baseball player she has a crush on and witness how they mature and become adults within just a few hours. The movie also has a strong antagonist in form of a pitiless chief executive officer who will do anything to survive. I have rarely watched a movie with so many addicting, authentic and profound characters. A special shout- out goes to child actress Kim Su-an who is more convincing in her role in this single film than many ambitious adult actresses in Hollywood in their entire careers.One has to be aware of the fact that this isn't a Hollywood movie. This movie doesn't try to be politically correct by adding a character of each possible visible minority in the world to the cast but we get a refreshingly realistic portrait of South Korean citizens fighting for survival instead. The film doesn't have a deeper philosophical meaning or tries to explain the zombie outbreak in melancholic images and words because this movie simply focuses on the dangerous situation where the characters don't have any time to over-analyze the situation. The sympathetic heroes of the story won't necessarily survive at the end of the movie and the last half hour includes several shocking and heartbreaking moments that will get you emotionally involved without being pathetic.In the end, there isn't anything negative to say about this movie that mixes horror, drama and action elements to what might be the best zombie movie of all times. If you haven't watched this movie, you have missed out on one of the greatest movies of the past few years. Along with the stunning South Korean horror film ""The Wailing"", the epic ""Train to Busan'' is the best film of the year 2016."
" Horror express.
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,8,"A week ago I saw a zombie film from Japan called 'I Am a Hero' and now this Korean. I have not seen a quality zombie film at the recent time. The second tier films like 'Cooties', 'Freaks of Nature', 'Scouts Guide...', all these were comedies. Probably 'World War Z' was the last decent zombie film I have seen and after that this is the one. So the timing of the film was another advantage. Since there's no competition, this zombie film rules. And not to forget the Korean style, they are among the best thriller film makers today.Directed by an Anime filmmaker, this is his first live-action film. When I decided to watch it, I thought it would be another Korean film, which rely on father-daughter sentiments. You know I kind of tired of that Korean cliché where at the final stage they let the kid sob and call it a twist. Initially I enjoyed those and later on getting bored of that. With that kind of reasons, I would have missed it. Being a film fanatic, I won't mind to risk a watch, except give up writing a review for it.But in this case, it was completely different. Even the characters, any characters in the film, either in the lead or the supporting ones, all are unpredictable. That's the biggest plus point of the film. At the end you won't be sure, who you were rooting for. You know in those edgy scenes, we blindly back the one we like. You will think you can guess the upcoming scenes, but the writing was very smartly done. Feels like they did not care about a sequel, if this meets a greater success. But who knows, this is a cinema and there were many mysteries kept unsolved, so they can pick up from one of those loops.""Whatever you do, you must finish what you start. It's worse than not doing it at all.""This is the story of a divorced, workaholic father and his young daughter. After the progress, many others join them. On her birthday, they decide to visit her mother in Busan. On their train, soon after it took off, they come to know that something is wrong around. With all the chaos unrolling rapidly, a group of survivours gathers in a car since there's no escape as they are trapped in a moving train. How their journey ends, whether they reach a safe place with the fight against the living dead, the narration comes to halt.In the contest of good versus evil, there's no place for sentiments. But at one stage, near the end they cleared the place to attach one. In that final scene you can't resist, even if you are not an emotional person when it comes to the film. As I mentioned earlier that is the part I feared the most would come, but i did not hate it in the context of story development. Because that was a perfect setting to take the story to the next level. There are several twists. Those are from the film characters' perspective than the story wise. They did not bother to tell about the cause of the epidemic. Instead, this film was focused on the train passengers and their fight for survival when the defending options are limited. Just imagine it is a zombie version of another Korean film 'Snowpiercer' or like 'Snakes on a Plane'.I have heard there's another film, an animation which is also directed by the same filmmaker and said to be a prequel to this one. If you had liked it, you would be itching to watch that one as well. Hope I would watch it as soon as I get an opportunity. So, my view on it, the film is very good. It was close to two hours long, but once the train journey begins, you won't going to notice the time. I am saying the pace of the film, as well as the events make you dissolve in it completely and forget everything else. This is the best zombie film right now and you should not miss it, especially if you like this theme. Recommended!8/10"
" Excellent Zombie Flick
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,9,"First off, don't watch the trailer! If you're a fan of Korean cinema and modern zombies, just get straight to the film. The film has several genuinely good 'Oh my god' eye-budging moments for the viewer and they spoil some of those in the trailer.The film truly captures the stress, and anxiety of a WWZ zombie scenario. You agonize over the vulnerability of the survivors, especially when there's no Zeds in sight. It gets going fast, builds the characters surprisingly well considering they get little exposition, and kinda just keeps going on full steam for 2 captivating hours.It's not exactly all on a train, either. That premise put me off slightly as I thought it might get a little stale, or perhaps they were on a budget. But no, there's more to it. And even one or two original ideas, believe it or not.This film takes no prisoners. It's brutal and sad, but somehow keeps a certain charm. It has the most adorable child actor - who performs brilliantly imo - and whilst she's a weaknesses for the survivors, never feels like a burden to the story. You will be rooting for them at the teary end."
" Not the best horror film of 2016, but it gets the job done
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"This film had me at a crossroads; one the one side, I am a lover of South Korean cinema, and I feel that the country is doing more to advance the art form than any other country. On the other hand, the movie was tame, simplistic, and devolved into a typical Hollywood style blockbuster, with none of the nuance and tact usually found in S.Korean movies. I had heard such great things about this film, and as excited as I was to see it, I just could not shake the feeling that it was limited by either the producer, the country, or the creative team. Where it could have been gruesome and disturbing, it aimed to be tame and heartfelt. I don't care about the human condition when it comes to Zombie films. I care about the Zombie's, who they kill, and how vicious they could get away with showing it.The acting was superb, and the cinematography was indicative of a very talented creative team. Why this didn't yield a more transcendent and original film, I will never understand. It really did seem like the team wanted to do something grandiose, but kept their reigns pulled back in order to not offend, disturb, or frighten their audience. Basically, a Zombie movie that isn't frightening just isn't worth your time. While Train to Busan was a great film (even by South Korean Standards), it could have been so, so much more. At it stands, it is simply an entertaining film from a talented team of creators and actors, and I suppose that this should be enough for any fan of horror films to give it a watch.FYI; If you want to see a truly entertaining, graphic and unique Zombie film, I would suggest watching the Japanese movie ""I Am A Hero"". It is objectively the best Zombie film of 2016, and deserve any real horror fans time and attention. It blows this movie so far out of the water, that it is not even a contest."
" One of The Most Sound Inspections Inside Horror Sub-Genre
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,6,"Current walkers' genre arises from horror/survival films chiefly, which located its golden years at the end of the 1960s, where the sub- genre genesis was cemented with a brand new and unique solvency, the same one that slaughters the audience as genuine vultures without any substance. Although there's not an accurate date about when it was considered preeminent in the celluloid world, but we do know the three men who reflected heterogeneity and universal depth that an undead horde may originate. The first man was who took the chance to emit an uncommon conception at that time, where demise was not the conclusion in the lifeline, but one cycle more for transfiguring itself into testimonial detriment. George A. Romero, he was who opened the pathway with a must-see crowning work, essential for anyone who is adept to the heterodox category. A few years later, Danny Boyle built a task titivated with ingredients with which we were already getting familiar, however, they were endowed its work with collective and psychological idiosyncrasy; the above made us apprehended the same nature viewed from an opposed and eccentric perspective. And finally, three years ago moderately, Marc Forster propelled zombie theme to extremist and utter crippling visual dimensions —it's so like Hollywood, — nevertheless, he also managed to impregnate it a relevant dramatic connotation. It is, in fact, a shame that among hundreds of projects which are both crowded together on the small screen as on the big screen, only these three cases truly get to be more than an ephemeral film; a film with justifications, rudiments, soul and laconic structure.Yeon Sang-ho's ""Train to Busan"" or ""Busanhaeng"" (original title), glorified formidably by key contests in the issue, exposes and pours strategically concerning and globally significant thesis into a top- level artistic and choreographic majesty, nonetheless, the movie expressed neither something substantially divergent nor fresh in cinematic terms, what categorizes it as an entertaining, effective and somewhat nugatory film. Cannes and Sitges opened the doors to the director, newcomer in live-action movies—since his previous works have been clearly animated, among them is the initial part of this story, ""Seoul Station"", screened at BIFFF, serves as outbreak and exordium within this atmosphere, — to testify his assiduity and supremacy in this classification; These festivals intensified significantly commercial splendor through Word-of-mouth marketing (WOMM) around the film, drawing more than 11 million in attendance just in Korea.In essence, the storyline takes place inside of a train which departs from Seoul; place in where an opportunist and self-centered father is constricted by his daughter to buy two tickets for a prolonged travel in the carriages; she longs vehemently for visiting her mother in Busan, South Korea's second most-populous city and in where this public transport has delimited its arrival.The quandary is that in the morning, an abnormal virulence, stirred up by main character's biochemical corporation, charges against Korean residents of an intense and enraged way, originating a hair-raising maelstrom territorial.While they thought that in comfort of their train indemnity was infallible, one infected sneaks in the rear coach inducing an out-of-control derangement; the only hope for passengers is to arrive as soon as possible to Busan, site where a hypothetical military shelter sits, however, the walkers are not the worst catastrophe, human begins' apocalypse and corruption is it.The film is closely influenced by two antithesis managed of clever way at least mostly: in the first place, narrative proposal is fully foreign along with comic and western popular culture references; and in the second place, characters are significantly oriental, which connect with other factors correctly, among them stand out superb mise-en-scène—which no longer has any reason to ""envy"" American cinematic mecca, —an impetuous soundtrack supplying exuberance, a relevant dramatic talent and a final act that derails its film and plot ambitions beyond its own limits, to a certain point.The huge and mundane obstacle is it adjusts and stretches on genre clichés, providing entertainment without offering something little know, equally, the slow-pace beginning and over-the-top sensitive moments reduce the fantastic results from the first 45 minutes.Once again, it argues unexplored—or at least, unseen— aptitude of oriental cinema. ""Train to Busan"" is a well-made rail travel with zombie thematic which subverts in its narrative threads individualism, disparate social conditions, selfishness and lack of concern for the welfare of the other, issues punching our contemporary society every morning. ""Busanhaeng"" represents all what a roamer film lover aspires to see, however, manipulates the used components with one different hand, creating a splendid visual beauty to generate such feeling. Refreshing, captivating and even entertaining; the film is as frantic and direct as the same train."
" This is called a real zombie movie
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,8,"I would say this is a perfect package to deliver a real entertainment. It has drama,emotion,thrill,horror everything , which makes it a real gem. Hollywood should learn from this. I have watched various Hollywood zombie flicks and every movie has the same thing, people are running and zombies are behind them. But this movie gave it a completely new thought and it tells how zombie movie can be made in an awesome way. Everyone in the movie has acted well, specially that little girl.There are few scenes that will make you laugh. So it has comedy too. In past few days, i have watched few Korean movies that changed my thinking about Hollywood. There are other cinemas that can make movies better than the Hollywood."
" Bullet Train Busan.
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,10,"Talking to a fellow IMDber about what his top film of 2016 was,I got told about a tantalising Korean Horror epic that he had seen at a film festival. Deciding to hold a 2016 Horror double bill viewing this weekend (with the other being the gritty Brit zombie title The Girl with All the Gifts) I booked a ticket for the Busan train.The plot:Putting all his attention on work, Seok-Woo barely sees his daughter Su-an.Sick of hardly seeing her dad,Su-an demands Seok-Woo to take her to Busan,so that Su-an can spend her birthday with her mum/his ex- wife. Taking it on the chin,Seok-Woo books the tickets for him and his daughter. Just before the train departs,a convulsing women jumps on the train.Noticing a large bite mark,Seok-Woo,Su-an soon find their destination to change from Busan to a zombie apocalypse.View on the film:Spending (most) of a two hour running time on a train,writer/director Sang-ho Yeon turns down a comfy seat to lay the track for a white-knuckle ride. Drawn away from Anima for his live action debut,Yeon & cinematographer Hyung-deok Lee brilliantly close the passengers to the chaos on board with ultra-stylish claustrophobic shots,which look from above at the limited room the passengers have for zombie-free air. Mounting up the zombies,Yeon brilliantly chews practical,in-camera effects with CGI shrieks,howling from Yeon keeping the gore to a minimum,to instead carve out an anxiety-drench Horror atmosphere,spun from the disturbing fast/slow spider-like movement of the undead. Watching the world die out as they drive by,the screenplay by Yeon eats up spectacular horror set-pieces with precisely hit personal human tragedy. Taking pit stops on the way to the poetic final destination,Yeon rolls the zombies in with piles of them darting all over the empty stations,with the unlucky pick-ups the train makes leading to some tasty shocks. Looking in at every carriage,Yeon cleverly uses the sweet drama between Seok Woo and Soo-an (played by the fantastic Yoo Gong and Soo-an Kim) as a foundation to keeping a close watch at how everyone on the other carriages fight to keep the zombie train on track."
" Excellent!
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,10,"Truly the best zombie movie i have seen so far. its like game of thrones but a talented guy wrote it instead of that miserable lard. i cant even being to describe it, the movie is perfectly paced and highly grounded in reality, or at least as much as is possible with these kinds of movies.it holds true emotion and family bonds, its truly a great movie. Giving a perfect 10 even though the movie does take some liberties to insert some suspense. Definitely highly recommend watching this movie.the child actor also gave a very good performance, never expected this from Korea."
" Amazing!
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,10,"Just amazing!! If you are a big fan of zombie movies, you are going to enjoy this. Since the 90's that i hadn't watched something like this. Great characters, intense, funny and with a lot of surprises. The movie breaks the typical script, off course that it has the typical clichés of the zombie movies but its shown in a different way. There are many situations that you never expect. The characters are natural, indeed you can feel close to them( that's a good thing when you are watching a movie), and its not usual in this kind of films. Also has the ""corean drama"" included but in a fun way (just my perception). I was surprised, and when a movie surprise you, you know that they did good their job. :)"
" Awesome with Heartbreaking Ending
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,9,"This is one spectacular zombie movie. The acting of all the actors are superb. No cheap jump scares, only genuine and sheer thrills and tensions from most part of the movie. The antagonist in this movie got what he deserved, which was very satisfying to our part as audiences. I was not sure about the little girl's acting skill, because she was like a robot at first half of the movie. But everything was revealed at the end of the movie. And it was really great. It was really heartbreaking when the main actor got bitten at the end. My only regret is that why didn't he use his shoe to gag the old man's mouth, so that he won't be able to bite? Were he to do that, he would still be alive with his daughter and the pregnant lady. Not turned into one of them and threw himself off the train. I cried like a baby when the little girl was crying, refusing to let go of her Dad. It was so sad. Why did they make the main character dead? I think that sucks BIG TIME! And that's the only reason why I didn't give this movie a 10 out of 10."

" One of the better zombie movies
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,8,"Second Korean movie that I watched this week and again it won me over. For a zombie movie, that has been done over and over again, this one is much better then most of the other zombie movies. With zombie movies you always get the same story with the same slow pasting zombies. In Busanhaeng though the zombies could compete with Usain Bolt over the 100 meters. They are fast and extremely aggressive. And that's only a positive thing for the suspense in a zombie movie. So it's absolutely not like in The Walking Dead where there they are literally just walking and a grandmother with a wooden leg could outrun them. I can't remember any name of the actors nor understand a word of what they saying but I have to admit that there are pretty good actors in Korea. Overall I would give this movie a seven star rating but as a movie in the zombie genre it deserves an eight because it's way better then other zombie movies. Great acting, a good story, fast aggressive and bloody action, you won't get bored for a second."
" This is how you make a zombie movie.
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"Hollywood will throw millions at special effects and give you an endless gorefest, and still fail to deliver a truly gripping zombie movie. Train to Busan is a zombie movie that delivers on all levels.First off, the zombies are excellent. No super over the top effects, just some simple veiny makeup and contacts, and you have clear infected and the actors movements just sell the rest. Keep your massively overpriced Hollywood zombies that look like they belong in a movie and enjoy a true horde of undead that actually make you feel like there's no way to survive.Secondly, the movie has heart. It has believable characters that show the range of reactions you would find in real people. There's the self made heroes, the reluctant heroes, the people just trying to survive, the frightened mobs, and of course, the jackasses that will throw anyone they can under the bus (or zombie) in order to try and keep themselves safe. Add to that the truly emotional moments in the film. There are scenes that are simply emotionally painful to watch because of how well done and authentic they come across. None of that Hollywood cheese that tries to slap you in the face with a cardboard emotional scene and tells you to feel sad. This movie shows you how real people react and the actors make you feel like you're the one feeling the feels.For people who want a great zombie movie, this is one you can't miss. It also wins top points with those looking for great survival stories, or the drama of dealing with everything going wrong and trying to find some ray of hope. This should be the blueprint that all movies should use to know how to make a quality film."

",2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"Great movie , and just loved it . But i am a bit surprised that not a single bullet of fire took place to kill a zombie. The pregnant girl was really really cute. Don't know what her actual name is. But just liked her .Her fighting husband and the little girl""s father and herself too . Good movie really to watch . It was a bit surprising about the late inter fair of the defense .But finally they protected the people.The most tragic scene was the father of the little girl""s death .The funny thing about the zombies was their senses were weak . They cant even see in darkness too . After all it was a good experience watching it on my laptop, smoking a cigarette while lights were off ."
" Not scary or gory. Tedious and boring. The ending sucks.
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,1,"Some of the characters' behaviours in the movie are laughable. For example, the first time the passengers got out of the train only to find the station infested with zombies. What was their reaction? Run back and open the door to a car already full of zombies! Smart move, people!For another example, a bunch of survivors in car #15 refused to open the door for another group of survivors, because some guy feared the other group might be infected. Actually, one easy solution would be for survivors in car #15 to move to another car, for instance, car #16 and let those people have #15. Car #15 was not the only safe place. But... They were too dumb to make room, those idiots.The beggar character's heroic move at the climax makes no sense. He had always been portrayed as cowardly. Therefore, the sudden 180 degrees change is not convincing at all.Let's not forget the laughable ending. The little girl suddenly felt like singing after the disaster? Yeah, very interesting. It would have been so much better if the soldiers had killed both the pregnant woman and the girl. That kind of dark ending would have made an impact. The current one in the movie is ridiculous.The plot was predictable. You could always guess who was going to die next. The movie is not even scary, and the amount of gore is atrociously little.I guess the only good thing is the opening scene where a deer became a zombie deer. That was interesting enough."
" Very little to complain about
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,It's a great Zombie movie that focuses more emphasis on the people rather than the fact that Zombies are running around. Unlike the majority of movies in this genre. Character development is right on the money even for those who only get a short amount of time or lines on screen. I have a few bones to pick with the way things were carried out on 2 occasions in the movie but to an extent it is part of what makes it great because I'm left thinking backwards about how things could have gone differently only if this happened. Then I think further back and say the same thing. It's a must watch. You will be invested in the characters completely.
" The best Zombie Movie in 2016
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"I heard about this movie from a friend who told me about and said is very good. This is perhaps the first Korean Zombie movie, the whole movie except the first 15 minutes is so action pack and make you edge of your seat. Like most zombie movie, they don't really explain the origin of outbreak and the outbreak was happens so quick, I think this outbreak is the quickest I ever see in any TV show or movie. If you love zombie movie and show, this won't be disappoint to you as well. This movie more realistic show what would human behave and you will see worst of their form in this movie and also some of best form. This is good balance intake."
" It wasn't flawless but still thoroughly enjoyable
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"Overall, the plot and development of the story were engaging throughout. There were only a few forgivable occasions when the verisimilitude and consistency of dialogue, characters, and story were waning. To be completely fair, I really enjoyed the suspense kept throughout the entire film. The cinematography and editing captured the chaos of events really well and the deaths were neither predictable nor overdone. In the end, the protagonist reconciles his prior shortcomings and the film ends full circle. My only grief is that I wish they would have saved more characters, allowing each group to find their own way out the train station after the separation (which would have been more realistic) instead of killing everyone immediately and leaving just the daughter and girlfriend as the focal point (which is the standard but so very typical.) I also wish the writers and director would have explored the night-blindness of the monsters in an open urban setting (imagine if you had discovered that these monsters were absolutely blinded in darkness; why would you not have shared this with everyone and made your escape plans to accommodate that huge advantage?) There was huge potential with that, so I am slightly disappointed it wasn't utilized more significantly. But, in total, I think the film managed a 7/10.On a side note, I'm expecting some of these negative reviews are biased against the film for being of Korean origin. Also, the subtitles can suck."
" Amazing film, one of the best horror films of 2016
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,10,"I came across this by accident, and I am so glad I did. This is by far one of the best horror films of 2016. Set on a high speed train traveling through South Korea on just another day, the passengers are trapped inside a fast paced metal coffin of death, along with victims from a virus outbreak. It doesn't take long until the the situation is out of control and people are forced to defend themselves against certain death any way they can. The film is a road-map into the emotions of humans in a crisis. Ans we get to watch in horror as fear and panic claims just as many lives as the infected. We follow a random selection of passengers, but we closely follow the divorced father who has brought his young daughter on the train to visit her mother on her birthday. That movement from train-car to train-car could be a step towards safety just as death, and all the traits that make up who you are could be what saves you or lead to your demise.Amazing performances from the entire cast. Especially from young Soo-an Kim. Cinematography is great and some scenes are nothing short of astonishing. A film that constantly have your heart pounding and doesn't leave you unmoved. A must see for the horror fan."
" One of the greatest horror movies -- I was shocked it was so amazing.
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"Tonight, I was looking for a movie to watch on my InfinityTV.I have always liked horror movies and I came across ""Train to Busan"" (2016).That's right--a modern one for a change.This is a Korean movie, shot in Korea. I watched it in English subtitles.This is a horror movie with a zombie theme. I know that makes it sound very cheesy but the write-up on it made it sound like it might be different.It was. That is an understatement.This was a beautiful film. I cried at three points. There is a strong love story and life lessons about bravery/ethics for others.It has to be one of the greatest horror films I have ever seen.I will never forget it.That's right--a horror zombie foreign film in English subtitles. It was unbelievably good. The zombies were overshadowed by the stories and the rest of the movie.If you are able to come across it, I extremely highly recommend it."
" Pretty awesome
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,9,"I was kind of skeptical at first about this movie, but decided to give it a go and watch it. That was not a waste of time.Being a fan of The walking dead, World War Z, 28 days later and so on, this will be a definite addition to the list of great zombie movies.The youngest actress is captivating with her emotions,great talent. Good plot,great cast, characters you get to love and feel sad about, even shed a few tears too!Overall very impressed, now I am in a mood to look for more Korean movies to watch!"
" Exceptionally Well, Really a heart throbbing Zombie Meeting

Hats off to the entire team , loved their work and best Zombie Movie ever, the plot was really very well executed, and was ""Heart-throb Bing"" Really a Thriller and Most Engaged movie i have ever seen.

I literally cried watching that scene, and was feeling the pain. Thanks a lot for such an movie, we need content like this. Cheers."
