" A missed opportunity
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,5,"In the late 1980s Colombia drug lord Pablo Escobar (Benicio Del Toro) knows the authorities are closing in on him. He tasks his main guys to bump off his enemies. One is a young Canadian man (Josh Hutcherson) married to Escobar's niece (Claudia Traisac) who met the young North American man while he was backpacking around the country. He too finds that his life is in danger.This film feels like a missed opportunity that was knocking on its door; a great opportunity to build on with one of the most interesting stories of recent years with so much cinematic potential missed. Instead the film focuses on a naive young Canadian man who tries to retain his innocence to the end. We are left guessing as to why and how he stuck this out knowing what was going on around him: love? Awestruck? The film doesn't really answer this as there is little in the sense of chemistry between Hutcherson and Traisac as Escobar's niece, Maria. Instead he just seems naive until it becomes a matter of survival."

" Good Intro to Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,7,"Having already watched the crazily long (72 episodes) mini series on Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria (El Patron del mal), I am pleasantly surprised at how much ground was covered in this single feature-length film, and with such skill. In Paradise Lost, the character of Pablo, and his powerful effect on other people, is illustrated through examining up close the case of one young man (apparently fictional, but I am not sure) who got caught up in his web. How did Pablo seduce people to become devoted to him? What did he do when they were no longer useful to him, or might possibly pose a threat somehow (by revealing information, etc.)? Not difficult to guess, for anyone familiar with the workings of organized crime more generally.My only quibble would be that the title is somewhat misleading. Although Pablo's character and seeming insanity are revealed, the bulk of the story focuses on another person altogether. I believe that this apparently fictional character is best understood as a composite of some of Escobar's actual victims. That the fellow is something of a doofus makes sense, to be honest, so I find no fault with the acting of the lead. Put another way, just ask yourself this question: Should I marry the niece of the leader of a huge cocaine cartel, who thinks of her as his daughter?"
" This is NOT a film about Pablo Escobar at all. I feel cheated. It's simply about some kids working for him and those kids can NOT act very well, at all...
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,5,"This is firstmost NOT a film about Pablo Escobar at all. I feel cheated. It's 90% about some kids working for Pablo Escobar and those kids can NOT act very well, at all...that's my major gripe with this movie: no charisma from the leading (kid) characters.Benicio Del Torro is ok for the few minutes we get to see him as Pablo Escobar, but I thought Javier Bardem's interpretation of Pablo was better in ""Loving Pablo"".Conclusion: okay-ish movie, lacking punch because of mediocre kid actors in the leading roles."
" Puppy love between annoying hobbit like teenagers
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,1,"What a horrible adolescent romantic flick ! Hobbit like main character gets head over heals over a childish affected girl, but her uncle is Pablo Escobar. Benicio overacts a bad guy and there are ofcourse further more bad like guys in it, so in the end there is a lot of shooting. That's it."
" Conflicted
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,3,"I watched this movie Benito del Toro plays his part well as Escobar but the guy who plays Josh well hmm he just ambles in this movie then there is the girl who plays his girlfriend who ""cough"" is related to escobar as his niece and how did Josh get to become her boyfriend by asking for a glass of water yeah okay any way first part good second part meh so I give this film 3.5"
" Pretty interesting
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,8,"I didn't know about this movie. I just discovered that Benicio one day was Escobar. So, I really enjoy this different perspective of Escobar's universe. It is a really well done thriller. The acting is really good and the script quite original and interesting. On the other hand is a slow burn movie, so be patient and you'll get the reward."
" the story of pablo escobar's niece and future nephew in law
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it shows you that when people grow up with monsters they don't realize what is going on is bad. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" A passable fictional action thriller
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,7,"This is a thriller wrapped around Colombia's infamous drug baron Pablo Escobar. If you remember the fact that it's all fiction and suspend your logic for two hours it's an OK movie for its genre. As most of other reviewers put it Benicio Del Toro does a phenomenal job in his portrayal of El Patron although I don't know if it was a true characterization with all details of his personal traits. This is because at times, Del Toro seemed to give too much depth to a ruthless killer. However, the real problem is with Josh Hutcherson who looks like a miscast for his role especially in the second part of the movie involving suspense and action. Indeed, Josh's worried, sad puppy face reflects the true emotional state of a normal person who is involved with the drug kingpin whose track record is decorated with the murder of thousands. The same character, however, looks too wimpy to pull all the action, hence the ambiguity in the cast. With his indecisive, unconfident and overwrought appearance, Josh is not believable at all to play a person who'd get into a cat and mouse game with professional murderers which ends up with a gunfight. Indeed, despite the suspense, most of the subplots involving action scenes were glossed over and far from credibility. For example, it is not clear why the national security forces were so quick to collaborate with his henchman to search for Josh when they had been so busy with tracking down El Patron prior to his decision to give himself in. But for a person who wouldn't nitpick about such fine details, the movie is entertaining enough."
" Just brilliant
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,9,"I too am impressed how this film entwined fiction around real events. Only after watching the film and then researching after did I learn the truth.Benicio plays the role of the ruthless Escobar with convincing ease, I will be watching this again as added to my list of all time favourites."
" Blow
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,3,"You might think this is based on true facts. After all Pablo Escobar was one of the world's notorious drug lords in the 1980s. Yet Pablo Escobar is a side character in this.Escobar: Paradise Lost is based on a fictional story of Canadian surfer Nick (Josh Hutcherson) living with his brother in the Colombian jungle who falls in love Maria Escobar. Her uncle is Pablo Escobar (Benicio Del Toro) who welcomes Nick to the family and they live in his vast estate. It soon becomes clear that Uncle Pablo is more than just a rich businessman but a gangster with hoodlums that kill for a living.Thes story concerns Escobar's final few days before he give himself up to the Colombian authorities. He is tying up loose ends which means the body count is rising even of those who were loyal to him. Nick finds himself doing an errand for him, something that could turn out costly.The film starts off promisingly but goes off the loony tunes scale. Nick and his brother are too wimpy to survive as surfer dudes in the jungle. Del Toro seems hampered by a series of fake beards. The script just gets worse because the makers realised they do not want to paint Pablo as a lovable rogue."
" Avoid it. Very pathetic
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,1,"There are good movies and bad movies. This one to me is pathetic. Non sense, slow, it isn't the story of Escobar. Boring from the begin to the end with some scenes that you cannot believe have passed the quality check of the director. Really suggesting to the director to change job, maybe agriculture would be better."
