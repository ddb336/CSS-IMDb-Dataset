" Amazing must watch
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,10,Great movie this is a much watch movie at anytime without feeling any boringness greatly acted by Salman Khan child actor harshali and nawajuddin Siddiqui.
" Quite unexpected, actually
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,7,"Normally we watch Salman Khan movies to forget what real life is like. For a poor person Salman Khan is not just a hero, he's basically a fantasy. They all want to have 6 pack abs, luxurious cars, a big mansion, use-and-throw girlfriends like Aishwarya and Katrina, a huge fanbase and infinite power in the industry. All of this is usually apparent in all Salman Khan movies, but not this one. Here we have a pious, obedient and saint version of Salman Khan in the form of Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi.The story is actually pretty good, although has a couple of plot holes in the form of factually incorrect information (like Brahmins always being vegetarians, Pakistani police slapping a civilian for being a Hindu, the army letting someone cross the border just because they asked it, YouTube quickly spreading Pawan's story as if it's a normal thing etc). It's the acting that covers up the problems. However, the idea used in this story is very mediocre. It's not a kind of a movie you'd hear someone say that it's their favourite. Because it doesn't have anything new to offer. What it makes up with is the visual appeal and character driven story.I'm not a fan of Salman Khan. Rather I hate that person. But this movie is undoubtedly one of, if not the best Salman Khan movies ever made. And that's actually saying something since Andaz Apna Apna also exists. It absolutely deserves the box office collection it earned."
" A heartful, sweet, real movie finally!
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"I was sick of movies with no real feelings, full of shallow characters without any background. Then the innocence and sweetness of this movie made me cry several times. Must watch!"
" I am speechless...
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,10,"What a movie... I am speechless... And I saw it without translation... No need for it, emotions say more then words... This is best movie I saw in past few years... Credits to actors and everyone who participated in making it..."
" Such a Indian-built stereotypical film
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,2,"This film is so stereotypical, it's actually stupid. It shows Pakistan as if it's a war zone, like how the Indian Media describes it, and gives Pakistan that orange tint, that is given to Mexico by the USA. The story is based on the Indian narrative of ""Sem2Sem"" (i.e. ""We are all the same"") and ""Politicians Bad, People Good"" kind of vibes. Like the only thing the differentiates this film from the other Patriotic Anti-Pakistani films is that, 1. This has a bigger budget 2. This film somewhat does criticise Indian minds too otherwise this is pretty much a watered-down version of those kinds of films and the only reason reason why this film deserves 2 stars is the acting and the actors.Also to Indian directors out there: Urdu speakers don't just go around saying ""Janaab""."
" Surprise Surprise
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,10,Finally a good Salman Khan film which is not a remake and a good story. He acted tremendously well in this film brilliantly supported by Nawaz
" Total Masterpiece of indian cinema .
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Script is brilliant
Story is brilliant
Songs are brilliant
Acting is brilliant
An emotional journey with best message for humans."
" Best film of bollywood
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,10,This movie is not just for Salman fan's but for every bollywood fan
" You can ignore it
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,10,This is the best Film had Salman Khan has Produce and act.
" Audience-pleaser
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,7,"This is a crowd pleaser, feel-good, family drama. The direction and writing are good, scenes are well handled and despite a few flaws like drags and stretches, the film flows well. The film has a good deal for heart and the storytelling is precise, simple and roundabout charming. However, it does gets predicable at times and over-ambitious.
Salman Khan does a wonderful job and he is one of the plus points of the film. His comedy is fairly good, he entertains, he is the life of the film. Harshali Malhotra also impressive without uttering a single line and she has a good chemistry with Salman Khan. The rest of the supporting casts are all good. The songs truly move you and will put a smile in your face. The set decoration is beautiful and intricate, the overall movie is visually stunning thanks to the slick cinematography."
" Beautiful ..
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,10,For all age group ....one of the best and beautiful movie made in last 2 decades
" Great Story
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,10,"One of the most interesting stories I have ever seen , Not a repeated story But New story !!"
" Salman bhai
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,10,The best salman khans movie ever .. even if im not salmans fan
" My favorite movie of all time
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie is hopelessly idealistic, and I love it. I'm an American, and this is my favorite movie of all time."
" Worst film I've ever watched.
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,1,Most illogical and cringy film. And that little girl was wearing a hijab at that small age. Feeling bad for girls like her. There are many things like this in this film. Can't describe more.
" The best Salman Khan film ever.
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,10,"The Best film of Salman Khan. Best song, best acting, best dance, best lyric. The story very amazing. I am crying when see the ending of this film. So , lets rate good for this film and dont forget to watch this film."
" Salman Khan Best Movie Ever
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,"A Legendary Gorgeous Movie. Every Indian Must Watch.
Masterpiece Movie From Salman Khan.
Best Acting Salman sir."
" Outstanding.
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,10,"Salman best movie ever.
What a story .
Aweaome movie ever."
" For loose minded!
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,2,"Salman's role is worst by far and kareena is so horrible that not to mention. The story was a good one but its portrayal is terrible. Bad direction ever. Nawaz Sir talent is wasted here. Salman is not fit to be in this. He is best for adventurous guy, tough like attitude, unsentimental type. You know the meaning. The songs and tunes throughout are annoying just pops anywhere and trying to fit in the viewers mind but badly badly failed. You need to be very loose in thought in order to approve this as a classic. To rate it 8/10. Seriously?You see this is the problem in movie making. People think salman is super in it so the same roles are extended to TUBELIGHT and BHARAT. But it failed. Millions of rupees are lost for this futile attempts. You need to make some thinking prior doing a great job. Just money mongering is not Art. Salman is a star not a performer. 2/10 is for descent senior casts including that little girl.
Dear movie makers, in order to unite 2 enemy countries you need to be enlightened, not emotional fool. The movie seems like joke, not at all serious. It seems like mocking the real situations. If you want to make a funny movie then use funny agreeable jokes. Don't mock reality."
" Outstanding
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,9,"One of the best performance of salman khan, i m amazed by the performance and emotions is core of the movie"
" Beautiful movie
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,4,"The movie story of bajarangi Bhaijaan Kabir Khan and it is the makes outstanding movie.bajarangi is a hindi word which means one with a strong frame or a strongly built body. The word is also commonly associated with Hindu. On mission story about a little girl from Pakistan lost in India and how she is reunited with her country and family with the help of bajarangi Bhaijaan.
A 5years old girl Munni from Pakistan gets separated from her mother at an India railway station. Lost and hungry she finds shelter at the home of Pavan,an ardent devotee of Hanuman.
Bajarangi Bhaijaan is the moving story of pavan's quest to unite the child with her parents against all odds. Set against the backdrop of colourful Chandni Chowk,the film travel from the heartland Punja, through the deserts of Rajasthan,over the snowcapped mountains of Khasmir. For salman Khan's bajarangi Bhaijaa, parts of Mandewa Were used to give a look of Pakistan . The movie is about how a man discovers love during his journey from India to Pakistan. Bajarangi Bhaijaan tells that, who will move Heaven and earth to fulfil the promise he made to the from across the border. Salman Khan who enters with the popular selfie Le Le Re song.since she can't speak, Salman tries a number of ways to find out about her. Salman Khan really outdoes himself with this role of an innocent and simple man. Karena Kapoor manages to make her presence felt with a small but pivotal role.
.. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as usual ends up doing a fab job, but the true star performer of this movie is Harshaali who makes you laugh and cry range of emotion. The chemistry Harshaali and salman share is truly heart touching and something that can tear you up as well. A good movie with a great story.the rights range of emotion and some amazing picturization. The only places that some might not like are the cheesy,over-the board scenes that all may not enjoy as much. Bajarangi Bhaijaan the outstanding Movie. This movie is a TRUE story based.
Salman Khan all movie is amazing. Her all movie is Very emotional. Her movie song is Very popular. In this movie song aaj ki party, chicken song, selfie le le re, tu chahiye. Bajarangi Bhaijaan is salman Khan's most daring film where Salman presents a beautiful performance-but allows the strory to be real dabangg. It makes a beautiful, mubarak point one that's Very dabangg too. If movies are meant to inspir, then bajarangi Bhaijaan fulfils its purpose with resounding success. It will motivate you to get in touch with goodness. It will you nagatively and positively in life, all the time. This one is a Golden heart. Any movie salman Khan has ever featured in before. This is a story emotion. Bajarangi Bhaijaan earned 603 cores wolrdwide and is the highest grosser of salman's career."

" Baseless story
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,1,A baseless story with emotional touch... Nothing else...
" A Movie of telling about Humanity
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,10,"Best film by Salman Khan.Leaving all relegious issue their is Humanity beyond all of it.And every religion first teaches us Humanity.This movie is best example for those who play divide and rule formula.
MUST WATCH."
" Hard to explain
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,2,Watch it and experience the nonsense. You can cross the border just by emotion and you can do anything if you are part of this movie.
" This movie showcases how we should prioritize love care,humanity and honesty above money , safety, fame... The protagonist of the movie is an example for being selfless above
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,10,"This is a very heart warming movie where a big devotee of Lord Hanuman who strictly follows religious ideals but later dare to even pray in a masjid just for a six year old mute Muslim Pakistani girl who happened to get separated from her parents in India. She is all alone and appears before him. He takes her along, take good care thinking she is a brahmin. Eventually when he learns she is a muslim from Pakistan, though he gets frightened but his humanistic ideals dont let him abandon her though he was a strict hindu religious man and an indian patriot. Later, movie goes through different heart breaking circumstances. Finally this man's deeds even bring ordinary people from two nations who hate each other together to stop this hatred. This is a lesson and the protagonist is an example for each one of those in Pakistan and India who considers themselves as true Patriots by hating the other nation. This movie showcases how we should prioritize love care,humanity and honesty above money , safety, fame... The protagonist of the movie is an example for being selfless above being selfish. This is indeed a movie worthy to watch."
" Great plot but fast subtitles
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,4,If you have trouble keeping up with subtitles this is not the movie for you. It has a great plot you can tell the acting is good but unfortunately I could not keep up with the subtitles because the screen kept going to quickly for me. I have no problem reading subtitled movies apocalypto is one of my favorites but this one was just too fast. Wish Hollywood would remake this movie in English.

" best story of the decade
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,9,"What an excellent movie it was,i saw this movie it was a best movie of salman khan career"
" Bajrangi Bhaijaan
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,8,Bajrangi Bhaijaan is one of the hindi movie the story of this flim tell about the hindu Indian man who is purely devoted to lord Hanuman and never tell lie. who help a mute pakistani six year old girl to go back to her lost home.
" One of the Best and heart touching stories
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,9,"Bajrangi BhaijaanCast:Salman Khan, Harshali Malhotra, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Om Puri
Director: Kabir KhanBajrangi Bhaijaan is a simple movie. Director and co-writer Kabir Khan has preserved the larger-than-life Salman's image and also allowed it to evolve. Thus the star is presented not as a superman but a simple human being.Bajrangi's real name is Pawan Kuman chaturvedi. HE is called Bajrangi because he is a Hanuman devotee. He is a child-like and morally upright man who insists on entering Pakistan without a passport or visa but with the permission of a security officer who apprehends him at the border. He is keen to go across the border to reunite a six-year-old, speech-imparted girl from Pakistan with her family.The biggest surprise in the film is the child artist, Harshila Malhotra acting as Munni. She has a heart-breaking innocence. For the viewers,it is love at first sight. Salman Khan is interesting because he's not invincible. Of course the audience are aware that he will eventually make miracles happen, but he also bleeds and breaks.Salman Khan as Bajrangi is endearingly naive and sweetly vulnerable. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, playing a small-time television reporter, comes into the film late but is worth the wait. He has a few powerful lines to his credit. Kareena Kapoor has the most under-written part, but even she gets one good scene. And as usual, her looks make an impression. Om Puri playing a maulana is quite memorable.The only shortcoming of the film is that it is too long and the numerous songs don't do much for the narrative.Overall, it is an overblown, old-fashioned, feel-good film that teaches us that humanity stands above religion, borders and politics ."
" Awesome Movie!!
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,9,Heart touching movie. Salman is at his best in this one and the cute little girl acts perfectly.
" With tears in the smile
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"Although the story is too far away from reality, the film is really good. The story is very moving. Love and human nature will become the passport without borders. Immature will create interest, mature will bring warmth. The movie is full of fun and humor, but also very warm and healing, moving, with tears in the smile."
" Faith and love
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,9,"When watching this movie, my heart was complicated and the tears kept flowing. Today, we no longer need to be feared, but we always need faith and love. Love comes first in front of everything. Love can overcome anything."
" True love and fragrant humanity
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,10,"Under the light of true deep love and human nature, all the obstacles shaped by prejudice and parochialism - different beliefs, opposite politics and separated land, are no longer important. Although the story is far away from reality, the film is really good."
" A fiery film like none other.
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,10,"It is a different kind of movie which borders on a lesson oriented theme for the people of both India and Pakistan. It is a very good effort by Indian artistes and film makers to provide an excellent platform of entertainment which binds the essence of platonic relationships of mankind. The people in general and the polity in particular may take cognizance of the fact that love and belonging are more powerful and enduring than hatred and bigotry.The simple story and crisp script coupled with fluid screenplay and evocative direction of Kabir Khan make it thrilling and engaging for the audience. The main theme of this film is a clear departure from other formulaic love stories and mafia baron movies, making it a strong case for cerebral depiction and brilliant portrayals based on moralistic purity of thought and action. The character of Shahida/ Munni played by a young Harshali lends innocence and injects pristine human values which cannot otherwise be expressed by an adult star.It is a must see movie, at least for the not so brotherly people of India and Pakistan."
" Perfect
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,10,Perfect perfect and perfect. The best movie of salman khan.
" Great Movie
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,Salman Bhai is best No one can beat him. It's not a film it's a Masterpiece
" A tribute to the single religion- Humanity
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,9,"Love has got no borders, religion, culture, names and even words. The film definitely gives you goosebumps a lot of times. One of the finest films and performance by Salman Khan.."
" Pure story
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movie of salman khan so far as far i'm concerned. Acting of harshali malhotra is just fabulous, such a cutipie, she is looking damn cute in whole movie, and she is major attraction as well. Just love this movie."
" BEST FILM
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,9,One of the best film of Salman khan.. very nice film
" Heartfelt and Colorful
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,10,It was a good story. Brings to light the ongoing differences between India and Pakistan.
" A Salman Khan movie aggregating an 8/10 score on IMDB even after 4 years of its release! - Do I need to be more specific?
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,9,"If it is a Salman Khan's movie and you cannot keep yourself from praising it, then it means only two things - You either have a terrible taste in movies or you might actually have witnessed a brilliant piece of work! It is the later case this time...
Once watching it, I am sure it will be an all time favorite of any cinema lover.Watch this movie if you are looking for -
1. Bollywood's best in recent times
2. A movie that promotes communal harmony in most entertaining way
3. One of the best work of Director Kabir Khan
4. Salman Khan's one of the best performance as an actor. You will love his portrayal of a dumb but pure hearted religious guy
5. Fabulous performance by supporting cast - Nawazuddin Siddiqui's portrayal of real life character of Pakistani news reporter Chand Nawab (Warning - you may die laughing)
6. One of the best performance by a child artist - Harshaali Malhotra as Munni
7. A well choreographed Qawwali - New version of all time famous Bhardo Jholi Qawwali (originally by Sabri Brothers)I deliberately missed the fun part, because I expect you to stop wasting much of your time reading all the reviews and simply witness this wonderful piece of work by yourself!!!"
" Decide if you're human
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,10,"This movie is the litmus test to decide if you're a human or a robot. If you did not shed a single tear during the movie, you probably don't have any emotions. The little girl and Salman both deserve oscars for their mind-blowing performance."

" power of humanity
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,6,"I do not like musical films. But I was not tired of watching this movie. 
You watch the long time without boredom. Acting is exaggerated. It's always like that in Indian cinema. It criticizes hostility to religion and bureaucracy very much."
" Touching.
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,9,"Thank you Kabir Khan for such a special movie. This movie is definitely a must watch. Salman Khan being hated my many, has proved again that he is no less than anyone. Bajrangi Bhaijaan is an inspiring, emtional and a family movie. It has got great songs and memorable characters. It's a treat for Salman Khan fans. And haters shut the f- up now. {10.0/10.0}"

" The BEST movie of Salman Khan and Kabir Khan
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,10,"Everything about this movie is unique and simply outstanding. It can also be said that it is one of the finest movies ever not only in Bollywood but also in Hollywood. Ok many people won't agree with me but hive it a chance. It is awesome.The actors did a great job. Salman Khan, Kareena, Harshaali Malhotra (the small girl) and every single character has been portrayed and played well. The overall structure of the movie is amazing. Locales, the storyline, the plot, songs (few of them), direction, background score and everything else. You will simply love this movie. It won't be wrong to call it a Masterpiece. Thank you Kabir Khan and the writer and the actors for giving us such a wonderful and lovely film."

" A wonderful India movie
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,10,"The 140 minutes (China version) in the movie is rich and interesting. In the movie a 6 years old little Pakistan dumb girl was separated from her mother in India, Delhi. Fortunately, she met a kind, warm-heart and honest man named Pawan. After realizing she lost her parents, he then brought her to his house, and made a swear that he would help her find her home and mother. At first, he had no clues at all. He originally thought that the girl is an Indian and she believed in Hinduism. But after he was shocked that the girl likes eating chicken and could pray as a Muslim, he realized she was actually a Muslim. While he was struggling that his uncle might drive her out of the door because of her faith, a weirder thing happened. At the time when Pakistan beat India in a cricket game, she stood up and applauded happily to everyone's surprised. The man finally understood that she was a Pakistani. He had to send her to her Pakistani home, but he was India Hinduism, while Pakistanis believe in Islam, not to mention the bad relationship between Indians and Pakistanis. At first, he requested a travel agent to send the girl to Pakistan. But he found that the agent actually wanted to sell the girl as a prostitute. So furious was him that he gave everyone in the hotel a lesson full of blood. Realized that the girl can't be back home without him. He decided to send her home by himself. It's not an easy thing. Although Pawan and the girl got through the border between India and Pakistan with the help of an Indian local, Pawan's honesty as a Hinduism still brought him a lot of troubles. Luckily, he affected a Pakistani news reporter who originally wanted to tail him after he escaped from the police station, where the police regard him as an Indian spy, with the girl. The kind reporter decided to be with the man and the girl until they found out the girl's home. On the seeking travel, with the help of the reporter, the group overcame all the difficulties in the way, and finally found the girl's hometown. However, as they were in the bus to the girl's village, the police came. In such an emergent situation, Pawan came up with an idea-the reporter took the girl to the village, and Pawan was to lead the police away. Finally, the girl was back her home, but Pawan was shot and then prisoned. In order to save him out the reporter upload the video he had recorded in the way and appealed people in both country to help Pawan. They gathered to the border and broke locked gate to India, Pawan was finally able to return home. As Pawan almost got in the India, the girl, Shahida, rushed out of the crowd, with a strong desire, amazingly she broke out her first word----Bajrangi Bhaijaan. The surprised Pawan returned immediately and held up the girl to the sky. This is the end of the whole movie.
The varieties of scenarios made me fix my eyes on the screen during the entire movie time. Sometimes moved, sometimes laugh, sometimes happy, sometimes sad. I think the most shining actor is the girl. (The chief actor Salman Khan is also good.) Though she didn't say a single word during the movie except the end, her acting skills were really wonderful. Her facial expression was so vivid that especially when she raised her hand to express ""yes!"", it seemed that my world become brighter! The singing and dancing parts are always a shining feature in Indian movies and in this movie, I like them very much. They showed us the fascinating exotic customs and brought us joys. 
Love is beyond borders, races, faiths, and nationalities. This is what the movie wanted to tell us. Obviously, the ending of the movie is easy to be guessed. But it didn't prevent me from wetting my orbit. In fact, a girl behind me even sobbed aloud in the theater at the end. It was the pure and great love between them which moved me. I have to say that if a movie can affect you despite the fact that you know what the movie will do, it must be a marvelous movie. 
I appreciate it that the mainland can bring in Bajrangi Bhaijaan 3 years after the movie was firstly released in India, or I would not meet such an excellent movie."

" Awesome Movie.
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,10,"Gone are the days when movies starring Salman Khan used to be script-less and only for the sake of ""masala"" entertainment. ""Bajrangi Bhaijaan"" is the best movie of his entire stay in Bollywood so far. At least among the movies I've seen.""Bajrangi Bhaijaan"" comprises all the elements that should be in a quality movie. A superb story line finds the protagonist, Shahida (Harshaali Malhotra), mute, traveling to Delhi, India for her treatment, getting off the train when she's about to head back to her home, Pakistan, to help a sheep stuck somewhere beside the halted train she was on. As soon as she's helped the animal out, the train begins to whistle and start moving. A fragile little six-year- old child, she fails to get on the train on time. The absence of Shahida is brought to notice to her mother only when she wakes up when the train has already traveled quite some distance. By that time, it was already too late. Shahida was alone in the darkness and she couldn't even cry for help.The next morning she meets this man, Pawan Chaturvedi, a selfless follower of Lord Hanuman, who was fondly called ""Bajrangi"". Pawan interacts with this girl, gets emotionally attached to her, and is determined to get her back to home on all costs. But none of it would be easy. Travel to Pakistan was put a hold to for a month and the only way our ""Bajrangi"" could get our Pakistani friend back to her home was crossing the border illegally. What follows is a string of incidents that leaves the audience jaw- dropped. The pains Pawan had to bear just so he could get his dumb friend - he named her ""Munni"" as she could not say her actual name - is set to leave an impression on the viewers.Pawan meets Chand Nawab, a Pakistani reporter, played brilliantly by Nawazuddin Siddiqui, before attempting to cross border, who agrees to help them. Impeccable performances put forth by Nawazuddin and Salman was surprisingly easily overshadowed by the débutante Harshali Malhotra, who, right from the beginning till the end, effortlessly managed to deliver all the expressions even the some of the A- Lister's of Bollywood fail to do - without nearly speaking a word! Kareena Kapoor was accurate in the otherwise limited screen space she got. Kabir Khan, the director, definitely managed to higher up his standard by a large margin since his lukewarm ""Ek Tha Tiger"".And the climax of the movie! Oh God, the climax! I do not want to spoil anything but it will certainly leave you speechless. For you won't have anything to say - you'll be busy taking care of something else with your face. You'll know what I mean when you watch the movie. Just an advice to the female audience - do not put a lot of makeup on your face before going to watch this film. (I can already guess you can make out what I'm trying to say.)"
" Nice Movie
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,9,"BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN is very positive , humorous and emotional movie. It's a movie which symbolizes togetherness between the two nation and religion, the story of the movies is predictable but still the director did a very great job of presenting a predictable plot in an unpredictable way.Talking about the actors all of them did a great job,each actor takes the movie to higher notch but in the end it's the trio of SALMAN ,NAWAZ and HARSHALI that stays with you after the movie, OM Puri was phenomenal in his short but meaningful appearance.The songs are good albeit few of them were unnecessary but the best ones were Zindagi Kuch Toh Bata and Bhar Do Jholi Meri , both of them were audio as well as visual treat.The climax of the movie is something which I can't define in mere words,it is an overwhelming and unforgettable experience which can only be witnessed once you see this movie in the theaters and I am sure you will come out with damp eyes and a huge smile on your face after watching this movie.Make your weekend count by rushing to the theaters near you to enjoy the beautiful journey of BAJRANGI and MUNNI and trust me this is a movie which cannot be missed even if an apocalypse strikes!!!!!!!"
" Good attempt
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,6,"This is not a bad movie to be honest,it is actually good way to promote peace between the 2 countries and forget the past and hatred but in the name of promoting peace and entertainment the director has just shown absurd scenes like security forces catching him and then leaving him so that he can make sure that girl reaches her home properly and acting wise Salman khan is pathetic and i don't know for what Kareena kapoor was casted and that little girl just won my heart,she was the best thing in the movie"
" ""Bajrangi Bhaijaan"": One out of the Two Movies that Ever Made Me Cry
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,10,"There have only been 2 movies in my life that have ever actually made me cry: ""Kabhi Kushi Kabhi Gham,"" and ""Bajrangi Bhaijaan."" This movie isn't just a symbol of unity to the people of Hindustan and Pakistan, but a beacon of hope to the entire world that yes, love is everywhere. It's not about the acting of Salman Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui or the direction of Kabir Khan: all of that was outstanding. But what matters the most here is that the lesson, the morale that they tried to integrate in this fantastic movie, was so beautiful that it touched every single heart of the audience. Of course, there are going to be some raters who will say that the acting or the direction wasn't good enough and will give this movie simply an 8-star. But this movie isn't what we see on the screen; it's what we feel in our hearts. Thank you, Salman Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Kabir Khan, and the rest of the cast of this amazing movie: you inspire people to love and live together. This is truly my favorite movie of all time.10000/10 stars for this."
" Fantastic Movie
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"Salman Khan plays Pawan, a devotee of Lord Hanuman. He finds a lost little girl (Harshaali Malhotra) who is mute. It is eventually revealed that she is Pakistani, and Pawan must risk his life and freedom to travel there and return her to her home.Khan plays his gentle character perfectly, but Malhotra--even silent-- steals the show. Both actors relate well to each other, and their camaraderie feels genuine. The plot is touching, serious, and heartwarming. Overall, it's a fantastic movie."
" An overrated Shoddy rehash from bits taken from movies that were a hit.
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,5,"Doesn't anyone remember ""Gadar - ek prem katha?"" Just a rhetorical question. This movie is a pathetic waste of time and a story, which is without a soul, that takes advantage of the fickle followers of Salman khan. The amazing success of this cloying kitsch is surprising, annoying and an insult to people who can actually act or direct a movie."
" A love story of Humanity
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,8,"Human loves kindness, unity and happiness in all. This is all that I can say this movie of Kabir Khan represents.For the enjoyment they added a lot of things. Two countries hate can't let a child away from his parents. That's why it is loved by all with very much love. The movie didn't have very big story or technical things but a lot of mysterious parts become open to all. Movie touches heart and strikes on mind. Jai Hind"
" Heart touching and very much enjoyed...
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,8,"The BB movie is very awesome. It have mixture of religion,race,cast and even cross border problems and their situation. Throughout the movie I enjoyed all scenes. But this is very very tough part that is explained by movie BB. How a man just for the sake of humanity and having strongest faith in God went to enemy country to meet her with parents. Nothing is better than this.India and Pakistan the very sensitive matter to talk but it's very well explained Indian Thoughts. Enjoyed."
