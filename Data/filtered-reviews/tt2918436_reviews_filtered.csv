" Creepy thriller
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Creepy thriller extremely thought provocative what if this could happen, makes you think decent acting"
" Fine, but could have been a lot better
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,6,"Although it certainly feels like a vast source of untapped potential- The Lazarus Effect is able to provide some intense scenes, and interesting moments throughout, just to push it to an average but decent level of entertainment. I enjoy the idea of this film a lot. Since the 1930's horror has dared to ask the question of what may happen if someone was brought back to life, and it's interesting to see how far we have been able to come with that, in the medical and science fields, as well as in film. The Lazarus Effect dares to ask this question again, and at times, can prove to be an interesting little dialogue on the subject. However, its ideas are not as fleshed out as they could have been, and instead of executing them more thoroughly, we get a somewhat average thriller. I feel the film had the potential to be great, similar to what the indie film The Autopsy of Jane Doe accomplished the following year. However, it goes for telling its ideas in the easiest ways possible, which can be entertaining from time to time, but also not nearly as exciting as it could have been. The cast was well done, the special effects quite overdone by the end, and the look of the film proves to be nothing really special. In the end, The Lazarus Effect sadly just seems like another victim of studio circumstance and budget problems, as well as somewhat inconcise writing, never fully developing its ideals, and instead settling for what was faster.
My Rating: 5.75/10"
" Started well, finished bad
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,3,I was actually expecting some more sense having movie and not this ... there is plenty of this style and idea budget movies on the market
" science fiction/horror thriller seems like a mash-up of Flatliners and Lucy
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,6,"TA group of scientists led by romantic couple Mark Duplass and Olivia Wilde are working on a project to briefly restore brain function in clinically dead patients in hopes of allowing medical professionals longer time to work on critical patients. Their experiments seem to work better than expected when a revived dog continues to live long after the effect of its treatment should have worn off. When a laboratory accident electrocutes one of their own, the others decide to use the technique on the deceased, with seeming success. But they soon realize that something is not quite right with their colleague.The movie has some style, and some creepy moments, but it works better when the story flirts with how guilt and religion can effect one's psyche in positive and negative ways. The cast is fine, although it was odd seeing the usually funny Duplass in a straight-faced role."
" This Movie Is Perfect! How Dare People Give It Bad Reviews!
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,"I don't know how the hell people can give this movie bad reviews. It is a perfect movie. There's absolutely nothing wrong with it. For some reason they are treating it like it is a failed attempt to re-write frankenstein or something, and thats not at all what it is. This isn't a frankenstein or a zombie movie or anything like that. It isn't copying any of the classics, in fact it is very original. And it is excellent film making too.The writing, acting, directing, and cinematography are great here. It is a great story, that is well executed. Olivia Wilde is an amazing lead who is drop dead gorgeous even when she becomes demonic. In fact as I was watching I was wishing I could be her husband, especially after she has her transformation. My attraction to her even when she became demonic made the film less scary, but I suppose if you aren't as attracted to her as I am it will retain its horror value.The movie is more meaningful than most horror films are. It has emotion in it. It unearths past trauma. It explores the topic of DMT and the science vs spirituality take on the afterlife. And it explores the dream world as well. It is both mystical and pseudo-scientific which is a great combination for a horror film (or a sci fi film).And of course this movie has a lot of darkness and just the right amount of killing in it. But it is not all about killing and is not about gore at all, so it is a movie you can watch with your kids, as long as they are 12 or older.But perhaps best of all, this is a movie that has a great arc, climax, and ending. I was completely floored by the end and really hope they come out with a sequel. Just wait till you see it! I am sure you will love it!"
" Nonsensical.
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,2,I've got like 20 minutes left and honestly I don't even know what's going on anymore.
" I gave it a 10.
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,9,Late at night tired.. 4th movie tonight.. this one grabbed me right away and i jumped a few times.. I lost track of time watching this. I thought this was a great movie. Everybody did a great job! Question is: When is there a sequal?
" Yeah Okay Lazarus Would Not Be Impressed.....
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,3,"Another movie about scientists experimenting with death. Kinda like Flatliners from the 90's but even dumber. Throw in a bit of Pet Sematary in addition.Really what you get here is pretty much a pile of excrement.-1 Star for the main scientist failing to realize that he'd made a huge mistake before it was too late...-1 Star For the Cheesey Ending......
A damn waste of Olivia Wilde's talents here. I hope she got a big payday.3/10"
" And the point was ... ?
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,1,I love a good horror movie when there's a point to the movie. And this one was?This film divorces its plot from reality and that's where it utters fails.
" above mediocre with simple effects
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,6,"Decent flick, that is what I can say of this clearly independant flick. The story is simple to follow. Just compare it with the Frankenstein story. But once they can bring back alive a dog, things go really awry with the experiment.It's the kind of flick who needs it from the jump scene's and there are a lot, some of them you can easily see coming but the creepiest I found was the one with the dog and the bed.The second half it's were the real horror comes in with cheap tricks but they do work. The movie goes faster in the second half and it's over before you know it. One thing I don't understand, the dog is main lead in first half, were is he in the second part?The effects as said are cheap but do work, you know them, black eyes, playing with the lights,...A bit of CGI at the end but it do works. So after all the movie was above mediocre.

" The Lazarus Effect failed to resurrect my dead brain cells.
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,3,"Rarely in supernatural horrors films are scientists depicted to be, y'know, smart. Common sense is often thrown out the laboratory to make space for convenient irritating jump scares or mind-numbing hand holding of the narrative. These medical researchers, whom have developed a serum (code-named ""Lazarus"") that brings the dead back to life, exercise that precise stupidity. For the uninitiated, or those not adorned to religious text, Lazarus of Bethany was a prominent miracle for Jesus as he restored him life four days after being declared deceased, exemplifying Jesus' power over death.To Dawson and Slater's credit, the screenplay writers, they did touch upon the ethical/morality debate between the controversial pharmaceutical discovery and religious upbringing for a total of one minute. Having said that, only one prominent question loomed over this snooze-worthy ""horror"": why? Just, why? These researchers, whom happen to be a romantic couple, clearly have some level of intellectual stability. They *should* know, deep down, that mortality is inescapable and chaos would ensue if a serum such as this one was made available. Apparently not.They trial it on a recently deceased dog. One jump scare later, it loudly ""woofs"". Sweet baby Jesus, this slobbering canine beast is alive again! Oh no wait, it's behaving strangely. Unusual new synapses are rapidly developing within the dog's brain. Something is clearly wrong, considering its fluctuating aggression as it teases humans into wanting to rip out their tracheas. They all acknowledge this, so instead of putting the dog down again, they keep it? They seriously decide to keep the abnormal dog, for science. That's the least of this group's worries though, consisting of two amateur scientists and a recently recruited videographer. Zoe, the fianc√©e to Frank, suddenly becomes electrocuted in a freak accident and dies. You know where this is going...! Yes, they decide to bring her back, knowing full well what it did to the dog. ""It'll work this time"", shouts saddened Frank.Essentially, Zoe goes full 'Lucy', gradually accessing more of her brain's capacity at any one time. Superhuman powers start to develop including telekinesis and telepathy. Blackened veins spew out of her pitch black demonic eyes. Clearly, this isn't Zoe anymore. Well, try telling that to her stupid husband-to-be. The one thing that frustrates me, that being unintelligent behaviour from supposedly smart individuals, is the most obvious criticism staring you in the face when watching this drivel. Thinly written disposable characters walking around a laboratory waiting to be slaughtered in a cheap and boring way. Loud unintelligible noises, including a pig for whatever reason, attempting to scare audiences. A waste of a perfectly talented cast consisting of Wilde, whom gave a suitably chilling performance if it weren't for the poor directorial scares, Duplass, Glover and Peters. Probably the only positive outcomes of this feature. That and the slight glimmers of intriguing philosophical concepts.Yet reducing The Lazarus Effect to a derivative mass-produced low-budget snooze-fest, which recycled the same old plot points from every other forgettable modern horror, was enough to put me down and never want to see life again. Oh, and what happened to the dog? Is it still lurking the laboratory after that terrible ending? Probably...who cares..."
" Half a movie great other half very bad , thats why a 5
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,5,"It looks like the plot started writing one person, and finished another. When i started watching this , it was going very well. Closed laboratory, instruments, dead bodies and the team of scientists are conducting experiments to bring dead to life. Im a lover of psychological thrillers without blood. So while watching the first part i started imagining the possible directions the film could take and they were all Super good, and i couldn't wait to see exactly what happens.. Then the stupid banal scenes started: light switching, loud sounds out of nowhere, faces appearing in the dark, and the rest that we have all seen already and sick of . The end left me so confused and disappointed i couldn't believe they really Ruined what could have been an amazing film. So so sad."
" It wassn't that bad, it entertained me
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,8,"I don't understand all the low ratings here. It was a nice entertaining movie, nice cast and good story."
" Well just mediocre
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,4,"The story is interesting and reminds me a bit of ""Flatliners"".
The plot was rather bad and a bit boring.
The topic of death and life after death offers a lot of potential, which remained unused here. The movie is just a mediocre thriller, one of many."
" Flatliners 2.0
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,6,"A great cast here, in a mediocre thriller. Yes, it feels like flatliners, but with a slight twist that can't decide where to go. Is it a horror? I guess, but not a scary one. The animals are generally scarier than the people, perhaps they should have continued in that direction."
" Things fall apart
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,4,"THE LAZARUS EFFECT is yet another B-movie sci-fi horror combo set in a high-tech laboratory and involving scientific experiments gone awry. I've seen so many of these over the past decade, and they always involve robots, clones, hybrids, genetics, you name it. This one's a bit like FLATLINERS and involves researchers experimenting with raising the dead. The first half, which is all set up, is pretty interesting, and features solid performances from a familiar cast including Olivia Wilde, Donald Glover and the underrated Sarah Bolger. Sadly, the second half wastes all that potential by moving into silly supernatural territory, with random demonic possession and predictable kills. The intellect vanishes to be replaced by pure hokum, and you're left considering what could have been."
" Wasted opportunity.
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,1,"If I'd come up with the idea portrayed in this story, then seen the movie, I'd be gutted.Up until about half way I was fully into it, I couldn't wait to see how they handled what was to come next. But I was sorely disappointed. A clever concept turned to trashy, non scary, horror.I can only imagine that those praising this movie haven't watched the proper horror movies of the past, because this isn't a good horror. It's just horrible, for all the wrong reasons."
" Not as good as it could have been
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,5,"The movie is based on a great idea around medical research and opens very strong, managing to build a growing sense of eeriness, danger and tension. But towards the end it transitions from essentially a creepy psychological horror, to something else entirely. Without giving details away, the last part of the movie is much more dramatic in terms of events, but goes in a not very original - and very unconvincing - direction and relies on a lot of the typical horror devices to get it scares. It would have had much more impact if they'd had conviction to follow through in the same vein as the first part of the movie. So it's almost two movies in one, the first bit great, the second very weak. And the pacing feels rushed. But it's very well acted and well made, and worth a watch."
" Maybe I enjoyed the other which I read after viewing making for me thins 5/10 instead of 4/10.
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,5,"Spoilers and lots!
after watching this movie. Lots of different opinions both positive and very negative. I can see why. It is a short movie and does feel rushed. The past memory of the resurrected lead(?) seems to me an almost forgotten element of the film. Not seen many reviews mentioning this though and if you have already I apologise. I couldn't read them all! It is not clear that off the character did not have an awful memory of causing a fire as a child leading to fatalities caused her to resurrect as a powerful source of evil. Would she have come back as a source of evil if she hadn't had this memory, if it is a true memory or aggravated by her guilt? Well the dog came back as a devious 'character'. Why? Did he feel guilty of urinating on the kitchen floor on the past? The two of them came back evil so the memory she had seems irrelevant. Accepting her childhood pyromania would not it seem make her less evil. Which means her lover she resurrects would come back evil even if he had lived the life of a saint. So the past memory is it seems just a plot ploy to explain her being so demonic. If she had dealt with her guilt she would still be evil. The only point of it seems to be her using it to hide herself as a saviour firefighter to conclude the film. Possibly.
On other reviews I see I missed the references to Reanimator and espically Event Horizon which is now blindingly obvious! Maybe more of a rip off than a reference? But it never occurred to me during viewing despite me watching Event Horizon two days earlier. I did though get the posdible reference to The Shining.
The film is almost all in the laboratory location, which though would cut costs works well. Acting pretty good by the cast. Being a short movie also works well, maybe inadvertently, as it does not overstay it's welcome. 5/10 is not a bad score for a movie of its calibre. I enjoyed it. Quite a bit really. I can see why it annoyed some reviewers. But I watched it at home. If I had paid to watch it in the cinema my score would have dropped. Significantly. Also as a laboratory worker I enjoyed the things sciencents perform which are just daft to represent what happens in a lab. Oooh I could write 10k words on that. But that made me smile. I enjoyed it. Not bad. But not great!"

",2019-07-21 00:00:00,1,"Worst movie ever, i ve watched several and this as worst"
" Science or Witchcraft?
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,4,It started as a mad science movie but ended up as a paranormal activity.
" Olivia Wilde is not that scary!!!!!!
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,3,"Wooof, where to start......This movie had possibiilties. It just went nowhere. The first 1 hour and 6 minutes was fine for a drama then it got to the ""scary"" part. Olivia Wilde is an attractive woman, no doubt. Its just you can't stand there and be pretty you have to stand there and be ""scary""!!! Come on, Olivia Wilde, use your ""acting abilities"". You can't let the black eyes do the work for you. I was surprised when she was about to attack her ""victims"". The victim didn't say you want something to eat or do you want to play some poker because she came up to them like everything was normal, and not menacing at all. I predicted all the jump scares ahead of time, and was not scared in the slightest. Hopefully, this movie seriously damaged Olivia Wilde's career."
" Above average scariness.
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,6,"With some elements of other horror movies, including Event Horizon and Flat Liners, this movie is good to watch if you're the average Joe wanting a Friday night in watching a horror movie. Acting is good. Premise of the story is good,. Some aspects could have been built on esp background to the story line. But if you're not a fan of horrors because you get scared, this will not help that. In other words, its still a good scary movie."
" my notes

" Waster potential
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,6,"This story line of this movie had a lot of potential to be a much better movie. the name itself has an extremely compelling connection to the most Iconic figure known to man, he being Jesus Christ . That fact leaves a huge opportunity for an absolutely brilliant movie but instead its totally wasted with stock standard horror themes such as telekinesis, vengeance, fear, hate, black eyes and a single superior creature that ends up doing the most mundane of things.
The resurrection of the main character was brilliant but it started to degrade from there on which was a huge shame."
" Wasted potential
",2019-06-07 00:00:00,3,They wasted a cast that honestly is the only reason I bought a ticket. The film is so scattered that Olivia Wilde is the only one not doing the cliche she was set up as. Because she dies and haunts the film as another cliche.
" Started strong but faded away
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,5,"For a fairly low budget film it had a good cast and well constructed set. The concept is interesting and for the first half of the film you're asking questions and debating possible outcomes, complimented with a couple of eerie moments (pig mask and dog on the bed).
Sadly, it starts falling down from here. There are a few unrealistic moments (i.e why was the dog not monitored properly and in the lab after the experiment?) On from this, things start to rush a bit, and suddenly you're confronted with a supernatural twist which feels a little over the top.
Generally speaking, it's a less than average film due to poor storyline and execution."
" The Lazarus Effect
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,3,"A group of young scientists appear to have invented a cure for death. When one of their number is accidentally killed, they bring them back to life.This starts well enough with a fun, if not largely original notion. Where it goes wrong is when the individual returns from the dead, they inherit for no reason, all sorts of powers - of course. Death and destruction follows at which point it becomes dull and derivative."
" Decent enough
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,2,"Lots of loopholes but a good cast. It all happened in a few rooms/stages but it was ok n thought provoking surrounding the near death/after life questions we all ask.
A bit silly towards the end but still a decent watch."
" Not bad but not great

" It has good ideas, but fails to realise them.
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,4,"Sadly this is an ultimately unrewarding film, to read the plot, you'd be forgiven for expecting something dark, original and interesting, when in reality it's generic, flat, and badly realised.The production values are a little poor, and the storytelling is disjointed, lacks any sort of core plot, at times it seemed to make no sense.A few times they could have gone for real scares and horror, sadly no such moments ever happened. The dog could have been good.Quite poor. 4/10"
" Hadn't heard of the movie, late night Netflix but was pleasantly surprised
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,7,"Never heard of the movie and trawled tru Netflix for something late one night.Good movie. Somewhat formulaic but decent acting, cinematography and storyline with a few minor shocks on the way.No major flaws to talk about, the ending a little enevitable but defo worth watching"
" Great actors in a bad movie
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,5,"Im inclined to think the writers heard about DMT and decided to make a movie about it. This had some great actors, in the most stereotypical horror movie situations. You'll probably still watch it once, but you definitely wont want to watch it again."
" Nothing wrong with this movie
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,7,I saw all the negative reviews but I do not agree. A good horror movie should give you some good freak moments ( like Annabelle or the Conjuring) tension at the right moments and some good plot twists (like The others). And a good build up and storyline like The ring. This movie offers enough tension and freak moments. I also like the concept which reminds me a bit of Flatliners from the nineties (or Frankenstein).Ok it is not a movie that is a horror classic. I do agree that this is not a totally orginal movie with great plot twists or a sound storyline. But if you just want to see an entertaining scify horror movie then I can recommend this movie. The actors perform well and it is always an enjoyment to watch Olivia Wilde.
" Not perfect but way underrated!
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,6,"This movie spoke to me in a good way. Its far from a perfect horror movie but it has its moments and overall its good.What I liked most is the surroundings of a lab, kind of takes me back to the old Resident Evil games. (Read GAMES, NOT MOVIES!).Some stuff was kind of scary bit unfortunately most of the jumpscares only got to me while the rest I didnt even flinch because they habe been seen before more or less.I liked the music and the acting aswell. Olivia Wilde does a great job and so does Evan Peters.I didnt like the ending very much simply because it left me feeling the story never finished. We didnt get the answers we looked for in the film. Was it a demon? The devil? Why did she do what she did? What is the purpose? To infect the world?I give this movie a solid 6/10.Good job but needs more work!"
" A really good movie.
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,7,A really good storyline with a good type of horror!
" Complete Waste Of Talent
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,2,"Complete waste of talent makes poor use of common horror/sci-fi elements (jump scares, atmospheric lighting, smart people doing stupid things) and provides no foundation for its outlandish conclusion; at least it was short."
" So boring
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,1,"This was so boring and full of cliches. I knew what was gonna happen from the first few minutes.
Don't bother with this."
" Not scary
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,5,"This was an average movie, using all the usual horror cliches.I cant fault the actors, as they did a fine job with what they had.
It just didn't work."
" Fairly interesting actually...
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,6,"I stumbled upon ""The Lazarus Effect"" on Netflix, whilst browsing through their horror movies. And as I hadn't seen it already, I decided to give it a chance, without even perusing through the synopsis of the movie.The storyline is fairly straight forward, and it actually kicks up into high gear quite early on in the movie. While the director slowly builds more and more layers to the storyline as it progress, the audience are gradually thrown deeper and deeper in the fray, without the movie actually losing its momentum.One of the downsides to the movie is that there are no surprises along the way, but the movie luckily didn't fall into a gulch of being overly predictable. If it had done so, it would have not fared as well as it actually turned out to do.It would be a shame to say that the movie was scary, creepy or frightening, because it actually was neither. That being said, I am not saying that the movie was bad because it lacked these elements. But what it did have was some nice elements of suspence, isolation and hopelessness, which worked very well in favor of the movie.""The Lazarus Effect"" had some nice acting performances to carry the movie. The characters, though, seemed a little bit shallow, to be perfectly honest. Most of the characters would have fared better with some more in-depth character presentation and character development throughout the course of the movie. Actually, the character gallery was so bland and non-distinct that I can't even recall their individual names, only the faces of the actors and actresses portraying them. That was not a great aspect of the movie.All in all, certainly an entertaining enough movie, but hardly one that will make it a second time to the screen."
" Forgettable Rehash of Watery Cliches
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,2,I'm really surprised this didn't go straight to video. The cast was interesting but there just wasn't any meat on this bone. Olivia Wilde did seem to be having fun though. The writers didn't need to spell anything out for the audience because we've seen it all before and they failed to make us care about any of the characters (who we've also met before). The only saving grace was its brevity. Oh yeah - not scary!
" DID I JUST DIE?
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,3,"Zoe (Olivia Wilde) and Frank (Mark Duplass) have discovered a serum that speeds up nerve fiber regrowth. They have a grant and experiment on their dog Rocky which has demonstrated odd responses in his brain scan. About halfway into the film Zoe dies and is revived using the drug, something the trailer doesn't hide. Again odd things happen.The film is designed to take a different look at NDEs from that of science. The real action (the stuff you see in the trailers) comes in the last 20 minutes of the film which was short (83 minutes) to begin with. I spent most of the last 20 minutes wishing someone could locate the light switch.I was rather bored with the ending and explanation asking myself ""Is this a faith based film?""
See ""Flatliners"" again instead.Guide: minor swearing. No sex or nudity."
" Excellent! The true Flatliners remake.
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,10,"This is one of my favourite movies and the cast consists of some of my favourite actors including Mark Duplass (The League), the stunning Olivia Wilde, Donald Glover (Comminity), and Evan Peters (X-Men movies).The premise isn't really original, and without giving away to many spoilers - A group of scientists are working on the means to prologue the time a person can be brought back after dying or flat-lining, without neurological damage. They succeed, but greater then they expected, with the serum being capable of opening up numerous neural pathways at the same time (rather then 10% at a time). 
When the procedure is performed on a certain character after a fatal accident, they are not only resurrected, but bring back memories of years in hell. S&^% roles down hill after that.
The ending is a little bit of a let down. Personally, the whole idea would be better as a tv series...with a different ending."
" Boring. Boring. Boring.
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,2,The movie started out with an interesting story and likable characters. Then all originality came to a grinding halt. It was just contrived and dull. I would not recommend this movie.
" The stimulated brain terrorising!
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,6,"Actually, this film was made before 'Lucy', but released after that. So I first saw that and now this. Basically, these two films are similar thematic, except the genres are different. I liked Scarlett's film, a very much enjoyable. This film too looked nice, and watching it after that makes to understand it better. I meant scientifically, rather than a supernatural way. So what's extra in this was the usual horror film style jumpy scenes, with loud and sudden sounds.Limited cast, and one day event based film. Not a bad writing or the direction and performances. The settings were perfect, and the film did not require strong graphics. The story followed a small medical researcher team who is working on a serum that brings the dead back to life. When their entire work was ceased by the company they were working for, they decide to recreate everything to prove its theirs. Then something goes wrong, following a series of destruction before it all ends.Like I said, it was more a science-fictional thriller than your regular horror film. But it borrowed the same style to present on the screen. The events are simple to understand, except that scientific thing. Because there won't be any difference for those who are weak in basic science. It'll be another normal boring horror flick. For me, it's an average film, watchable for once being short and well paced narration.6/10"
" Just a mediocre horror about science people playing God again.
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,4,"""There's something seriously wrong with that animal. It's like it was possessed or something.""Once again a movie about the fact that playing for God could cause some life-threatening situations. Do you remember the film ""Pet Sematary""? And also ""The other side of the door"" showed that it's not a good idea to resurrect a deceased person in a non-everyday way. The same happens to Frank (Mark Duplass) and Zo√´ (Olivia Wilde) in this inferior Scifi / Horror. Zo√´ has developed a serum called ""The Lazarus serum"", to give health care professionals more time to do their work. By means of this serum, it should be possible to bring deceased patients back to life. During an experiment on a dead dog it turns out that not only the animal is walking around and wagging his tail again, but also the cataract he had is cured. They realize that they have manufactured something revolutionary.Of course, you can predict what's going to happen. They'll be using the serum to bring someone back to life. In this case it'll be Zo√´, who's being electrocuted by an unfortunate incident. But don't be sad. Frank doesn't hesitate to inject this revolutionary stuff into Zo√´'s brain. And before they know it, they end up with a non-human female person, whose brain is developing at a fast pace, giving her all kind of demonic and non-human powers. In addition, a youth trauma plays a prominent role as well. And so Zo√´ starts to develop this irresistible urge to send everyone to the place where she just came from. The afterlife.I have no problem with rehashed concepts. If only the package feels original and new ideas are introduced. And if that's not the case, at least I expect it to be a bit of a scary and terrifying horror. Unfortunately, it fails on all levels. It certainly isn't original and there are no new ideas introduced. And you can't say this movie is horrifying. Not even close. Even Zo√´'s carbon black eyes won't help. I have to admit that the used neurosurgery language was credible. To be honest this was the only complicated part in this fairly trivial story.So despite the scientific drivel and even the attempt to give it a religious touch, this film is just a watered down version of other movies about someone being raised from the dead. The only thing I was very excited about was the way in which Clay (Evan Peeters) and Niko (Donald Glover) were send to the eternal hunting grounds. But that's not enough to make it a fascinating film. Clay had better read ""Pet Semetary"" instead of ""Cujo"". He certainly would have protested against Zoe's resurrection. Or at least get the hell out of there. But on the other hand this movie wouldn't be the same anymore. Yet one positive feature. The film only takes 90 minutes.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/2qtGQoc"
" Disappointing to say the least
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,3,"This movie is very disappointing. It has a strong cast who deliver on the acting side but the script is poor with little for the cast to work on. The story has been done before in movies such as re- animator so you would hope in a new more modern version things would be pretty good. Sadly this is not the case. As the movie begins they experiment on a dog which, after re- animating, changes it's behaviour and it's brain activity is much altered. This direction of the film was developing pretty nicely but instead of continuing along that path it suddenly jumps way off into another direction when Zoe (Olivia Wilde) gets electrocuted.I found the film to be very frustrating, there was very little character or plot development, it's very shallow and quite boring. It comes across as a very low budget movie even though Olivia Wilde, Mark Duplass, Ray Wise and Evan Peters are all in it and it states the budget was some $3.3 million dollars!In my opinion it is a wasted opportunity and I wouldn't recommend it."
" Worth watching for fans of the genre.
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,5,"The movie is clearly a homage to Flatliners, but that's not in any way negative. Character building is fairly honest and I enjoyed seeing Evan Peters here as he has a good presence on screen.However for me personally I couldn't help but feel the movie got to that magic moment and decided to back away for a more modest and somewhat safe approach. Had that door been opened this movie could have become so much more.In the end the movie was interesting, and anything that Blumhouse or Jason Blum is involved in tends to be worth a look see for me."
" Decent horror movie
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"I think this is way underrated. While this is nothing intellectual, it is indeed an entertaining horror movie. Acting is quite good and it is overall pretty well made. I also don't think it's a weakness, that big parts of the background story are left to the viewers imagination. Did any horror story ever get better, when everything is explained? I don't think so. We get to know enough for the story to unfold, and I think that's totally OK for a scary movie. Yes, it's more popcorn cinema than deep or demanding, but I think it's thrilling and fun to watch."
" Although I'm not sure what the filmmakers are trying to say, I like the movie.
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Firstly, what is the purpose of the dog character(other than a proof of success of the experiment)? You have the Lazarus dog not eating, breaking out of cage, more interestingly and more eerily, standing beside Zoe(Olivia Wilde) while she's sleeping--which is quite a strange image,I think I can see the dog's penis when it's standing on her bed. I guess all of these are to set the mysterious mood.(Did I just answered my own question?) But the later half of the movie the dog doesn't do much except being disappeared by Lazarus Zoe.I'm still not sure it is a sci-fi or a supernatural movie. I feel it's like from fictional scientists' point of view to look at supernatural phenomena...if what I say makes any sense.I think essentially this is a love story. Because Zoe loves Frank, so she keeps waiting for the wedding, keeps wearing the engagement ring. That is what gets her electrocuted--she forgets to take off the ring when she connects the main switch. Because Frank loves her so he has to bring her back. Then because Frank can't stomach the new Zoe so he decides to kill her.(but fails and gets himself killed by her) Why do I have the feeling that Zoe loves Frank much more than Frank loves her? I suppose that's the reason Zoe brings Frank back at the end, because she still loves him. P.S. I like this Zoe character a lot; Evan Peters' performance is great; Sarah Bolger is gorgeous."
" Decently Performed, but not much else to see.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,5,"I honestly didn't know what to think going in, considering the amount of bad reviews this film received back when it came out. Well...at least the actors seem to be trying to save this movie from absolute failure. I actually did enjoy the performances, and the characters (except for Zoe) are actually believable. My only problem is that everyone was either bland (The Mains) Annoying (Eva) or just completely unlikable (Clay and Niko) The Story is not amazing by any standard of the word, and while the premise is....interesting, it doesn't do anything to hook you in, and the actual way it's executed is rather lazy. Once the characters return to the lab, everything just...kind of happens. Suddenly the EMBODIMENT OF MARY SUE that is Zoe is evil and wants to kill everybody, and she does! Oh and there's a really stupid plot twist i'm not even going to mention because if i do you'll literally turn into a piece of toast and be eaten by the nearest person. My Recommendation is to watch if you're interested, but otherwise never even consider it."
" Could have been so much more
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,7,"This re-animator vibe filled movie had so much going for it. I scratched the surface of a very interesting story. This could really have been much much more. The acting was above what I was expecting. Of course you get a few scare jumps, but that is not what this movie is trying to be. Yet it falls short of become something greater. The cold emptiness of the lab could be felt, it added to the atmosphere very well. This movie obviously got his inspiration from The Re-Animator, Pet Cemetery and even a little Flatliners if would dare to say. As enjoyable as it was, you can't help to fell like this movie was rushed out of it's intentions. That will leave you wishing it had more to offer in the end. Don't get me wrong, this movie is not dull or boring, but it strive's to accomplished something but never does. Well made and a great production value without a doubt. The plot is kinda easy to foresee yet keeps you on your toes until the end. Overall this movie is entertaining, but... Like I said , could have done much more."
