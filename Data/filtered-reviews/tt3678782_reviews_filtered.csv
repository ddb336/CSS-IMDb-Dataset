" Masterpieceüî•üí•
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,10,"The film was a masterpiece from sriram raghavan and team. The film's plot was not familiar for indian cinema
Varun Dhawan and Nawazudhin siddique acting was superb. Don't miss this film. The film have some negative reviews The people who spreading negative reviews have no brain. This Film is so underrated if this film is a hollywood film everyone will praise it. The Film was a masterpiece."
" Top Notch!
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,"Writing this review in 2021, almost 6 years after the movie's release. Hoped to see raw Indian movie experience and man did it deliver. The Film hasn't that many twists and turns and neither has any advantage of much shocking scenes. Despite that what keeps you hooked in the constant pace and brilliant cinematography. I am not a fan of raw, gritty and gruesome movies but this movie held me captive for around 2 hours of its duration. Kudos to director Sriram Raghvan for creating this masterpiece."
" Dont miss Badlapur.
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Badlapur review :Director Sriram Raghavan is a self confessed fan of my own favorite director, Mr. Vijay Anand. That could be one reason I've appreciated Raghavan's previous works like 'Ek Hasina Thi' (2004) and 'Johnny Gaddar' (2007) which were brilliant suspense thrillers in the ""Vijay Anand"" mould. I am also, perhaps, one of the few people on this planet who liked his Bond meets Bourne actioner 'Agent Vinod' (2012). Thus, I had high expectations from Badlapur (though, would like to confess the title sounded down market B-grade). Stepping out of the movieplex, I am glad to report that the film doesn't disappoint.The plot is quite simplistic. Raghu (Varun Dhawan) leads a happy family life until an unfortunate event devastates his life completely. Seeking vengeance, Raghu descends in to vortex of crime and hellish existence to track down the person (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) responsible for his misfortune. Things get dark and edgy even as the plot constantly throws in surprises and twists making the movie an engaging roller coaster for its viewer.Of the cast, Varun Dhawan's Raghu remains etched in memory even after the movie is over. And Dhawan's performance is nothing short of extraordinary; his character evolving from a peaceful family man to a ruthless killing machine. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is excellent too as the antagonist with a twisted sense of humour. The ladies don't perform any lesser, specifically Huma Qureshi and Divya Dutta. Radhika Apte, appearing only in the films second half, is also a standout. Yami Gautam doesn't get much screen time but still manages to leave a mark.Certain sequences, like the meeting at a sea food restaurant and the pre-climax showdown at Raghu's place are superbly executed. Edit cuts between the present and past also deserve a special mention. The songs, serving as background score, complement the narrative perfectly.Clearly, Badlapur is a step forward for Sriram Raghavan, both in terms of treatment and technique, in the thriller genre. I am sure the late Vijay Anand would feel proud.Don't miss the film..and yea, as its title adds, Don't miss the beginning!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."
" Best üëçüèæüëçüèæüëçüèæ
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,7,"This movie is one of the best bollywood films. Great Acting of Radhika Apte & Nawazuddin Siddiqui just nailed it. Combination of there two stars are best . Many successful work of them are.. sacred games, Manjhi the mountain man, Raat akeli hai.."
" Rise of Indian neo noir
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,10,I think one of the best grounded neo noir in hindi. Acting is up to the mark and storyline was good nawaz rocks the show. Overall a excellent crime revenue drama in Indian cinemas.
" Varun's best performance till today.
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,9,Badlaur ia a superb film that everybody should watch. Varun Dhawan is so successful thats why he got too much haters in a short time but undoubtedly he is a brilliant actor.
" Mind blowing film
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,9,Badlapur ia a superb revenge drama film that everybody should watch. Varun Dhawan is so successful thats why he got too much haters in a short time but undoubtedly he is a brilliant actor.
" Good movie for Bollywood standards
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,9,"Would've been better specially cinematography
Story bare bone but satisfactory"
" Great work by actors, good Movie!!
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,8,Story of the movie is good. The director deserves a lot of credit. Acting phenomenal over all. Highlight for me undoubtedly was Varun Dhawan. He simply showed a glimpse of the unlimited potential that he has. Great display of overall talent fromt he entire cast & crew
" Gooood
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,7,"I kinda liked this side of Varun Dhawan....nice thriller with a lot of suspense...keeps you at the edge of your seat for most of the time
Acting were very good by all especially Varun and Nawaazudin Siddique"
" Decent movie one time watch
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,7,"The plot characters all did a fantastic job the suspense keeps on increasing keep you gripped till the very end. giving it a 7 as i felt on some level the ending did not keep up with the intriguing flow which was set from the starting.
anyways it is worth it."
" A beautiful depiction of human behaviour..
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,9,The hero becomes a villan and villan becomes the hero. The film tells us about no matter how bad a person is there is still some humanity in him and vice versa. It tells us about the value of human life in subtal ways... Nawaz is best ..Varun also did a good job. Nothing is black and white everything is grey. Plz watch it.
" Waste of Time, Horrible Movie
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,2,"Unfortunately wasted 2 precious hours of my life, watching this sleazy, violent so-called ""movie"".
Absolutely no story. Just one single plot line has been stretched for 2 full hours. Poorly written. shoddy
I'm giving it 2 stars only because of Nawazudin Siddiqui's acting performance. Rest of the star cast were just passable.
Please do not waste your time and/or money on this cinematic disaster."
" And rating it 1 is being generous!
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,1,"Sriram Raghavan, a big name in thriller comes up with an absolutely misleading title 'Badlapur', which is not just appalling, but also tries to justify and glorify the unjust behavior of a so called 'grief-stricken' husband Raghav (Varun Dhawan) for all the wrong reasons.Simply put, the story, the sullen-eyed Varun Dhawan and Raghavan, all failed to impress me. Raghavan is living under an impression of being the Quentin Tarantino of India, No sir, you are far away from him! Tarantino is a legend, who doesn't glorify misconducts, but captures them all with a neutral eye. And Varun, you are no John Travolta, so just stick to some senseless comedies like Judwaa 2. Stop fooling the people in the name of thriller and neo-noir. This is a bleak and badly written film, with tonnes of objectionable scenes and senseless editing. What was the message after all? That all the grief-stricken husbands and fathers should become misogynists, rape women, kill them brutally, flirt with them or use them as sex toys?I have serious doubt on the intentions of this teary-eyed protagonist (or should we call him antagonist?) Raghav, who pretends to be sad and shows his tears as an alibi of his emotions, but he has no qualms in behaving like a sex maniac when it comes to women, so he is a go-getter when it comes to wine, women and wealth. Yes, you see his dark career progress so rapidly!At least Nawazuddin was true to his character. He was a born cheater, but somehow ends up accepting his mistakes and turns himself to the police, but what about Raghav? Does the name 'Badlapur' have anything to do with 'Adla-Badli', where Nawazuddin walks into a gentleman's shoes, whereas Dhawan ends up wearing a cheater's shoes?If Badlapur is the standard of thrillers these days, then I must say that the thriller genre is on a downward slide and will soon die if directors like Sriram Raghavan keep strangulating it. It's utterly shameful to read positive reviews about this film, with people cheering it up as a revenge saga or something of a great value rather than actually realizing its shallowness, depravity and meaninglessness. As a viewer, I am ashamed to have watched this piece of junk, which is a living example of pathetic, putrefied and decayed taste of the audience of the new millenium."
" What makes it so good?
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Nawaazudin with his ground breaking performance acts as a perfect disguised villain and varun plays the role of angry revenge-seeking person perfectly, It is one of the best must-watch movie of all time"
" A 10/10 psycho thriller
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,10,"Writing this review after watching this flick after 5-6 times. I personally love dark movies and this one is a treat to watch. Not the best one but stands strong definitely among Ugly,Ratsasan kinda movies. Unexpected amazing performance by Varun Dhawan and expected Over the top acting by Nawaz. Everything was so perfect with this movie but at the Sriram Raghvan steals the show with his direction. Twisting a simple revenge tale over 20 years with no nonsense attitude is just fabulous."
" Revenge is the dish served cold
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,10,This title suits the movie. Movie is very disturbing but can be said that best revenge film ever made
" The cops here are quite primitive
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,5,You caught a guy and found the kidnapped woman was shot. The first thing an experienced cop to do was gloved up both hands of the suspect's and tested his hands and arms to see if there gunpowder residues on them. The cops should never just take the suspect's words to conveniently frame the missing absent robber for granted. This should be the first step to see when gun was used during that carjack. It only showed how poor and primitive the Hindi police investigation protocol.This movie is too mediocre and too traditionally predictable to be praised with high rating.
" Haunting
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,9,"I hadn't read anything about the film prior to watching it, and I remember within minutes I was like oh dang, this looks so average. Up until this film, Varun Dhawan seems nothing more than a candy man actor with a goofy smile, but he was just incredible in this film.
Nawazuddin is just splendid, he just oozes with talent and nuance, this guy is honestly just a pleasure to watch. I never felt as though I was watching someone acting in his role as nalaik Laik.
The storyline appears basic but the execution left me really thinking about everything afterwards. I always find it difficult to believe the transition of good guy to bad after a traumatic event, but this was done so cleverly that it felt organic and absolutely plausible - a man that was so emotionally damaged and sick with revenge that it propels to the dark side before he even realises it.
Warning : There are some disturbing scenes in this film (for all intents and purposes) but wow definitely worth a watch, or two!"
" This Movie Must be Released again..
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,10,I love This movie...and its my all time favourite movie...we can't feel any acting but we feel like its really happend..must watch ..
" Oscar level movie indeed ,
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,10,"Sri ram raghwan has created an masterpiece ,raised level of bollywood , varun ,nawaz uddin delivered great memorable performances , must watch movie .."
" Same old revenge crap
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,3,If it wasnt for nawazudin siddiqui this movie was utther flop. 3 star rating is due to nawaz and varun acting. Otherwise the movie had nothing. Complete waste of time.
" Who was Protagonist and who was Antagonist? A very tough question after watching this.
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,9,"This is my very first review of any film after watching about every masterpieces around the globe. This is only to praise Indian cinema. These types of movies are required for audience to think about revenge.Very Raw......absolute real image of revenge. How a protagonist becomes antagonist and when an antagonist becomes protagonist, it has happened in a very subtle way....very gradually.The only thing which I disliked was that the story itself is not sufficient to make anyone intact to the screen. It's less entertaining, but after watching you will definitely think about this for hours or days.The first scene of this movie is awesome. Very unique type of camera shot which I have seen so far.This is not a Tarantino style revenge drama which focus on stylish killing, gore and blood. This is a movie which anyone should watch alone without any interruption. Those people who involve in the character while watching movies, this movie is for them."
" varun in different avatar
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,8,"It is a definitely a game changer movie for varun dhawan who has played a complete different role which no one would expect him to do so in his earlier career and he did it superbly. Nazwz as usual performed brilliantly . Other supported cast has performed their role nicely. 
The story is dark not to watch with family but also such kind of movie which should not be miss.
the music is awesome such as jeena jeena , judai and direction is superb.
No one will feel bored in the movie."
" Terrific acting by Varun dhawan
",2017-11-24 00:00:00,9,"seriuosly dint expect varun dhawan to act so serious role, he is kind of immature coolleege kid acting done so long, but my god the way acted in this movie actually revealed hisd true potential , varun has to explore more of his role characters for reaching greater heights,...he totally deserves to be awarded expecting an actor who has done the same kind of role, again and again, to act in the same way I s easy for him eg nawassidin siddique whereas varun has done never this kind of role ..hence he deserrves the praise ==== what a stellar performance...keep goiung varun"
" Abig yes.
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,9,"Very good gritty revenge caper. Varun shines here and this boy will go far. Nawazuddin is amazing as the unrepentant, lying loser. No clich√©s, our hero has no issues sleeping around while mourning his love, This is almost a classic. Despite the stretched ending this easily falls in the Ek hasina thi. Johnny Gaddar category. A must watch."
" Could have been better
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,5,"Since it was a revenge movie,i had high expectation on this movie but this movie disappointed me,it is just an average 1 time watch,direction is poor so is the screenplay and acting wise Varun Dhawan is not suitable for this kind of character and Nawaz from nowhere looks like a villain and sometimes i fail to understand where is the revenge in this movie"
" Excellent!
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,10,Varun Is In His Best! He has shown his Acting skills that he is way better than his Studen Of The Year Counter Part in this movie. The Plot Twis is So Brilliant! The Weird Thing about this movie is that you start to sympathise for the Antagonist and Dislike/Hate The Protagonist at the End Of The Movie.
