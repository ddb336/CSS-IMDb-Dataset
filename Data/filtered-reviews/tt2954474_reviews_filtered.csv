" Lovely suspense...
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,7,"The type of cliché film, which starts to be cliché by the title, both the original and the translation, but I like it, the gloomy atmosphere, the mystery around the house, spirit, the bad decisions made, the usual scares, the script simple, but all in the measure to involve us sufficiently... Lovely suspense..."
" From the Lohan-Hough School of Fine Acting
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,1,"If it wasn't for Fisher parading around for the first five minutes in f-me boots and cut-offs, this movie would be irredeemable."
" Bored movies
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,5,"The beginning of the film was quite boring, the film started to entertain me sometime after half the film. As for the horror effects, they were very weak, there were also a few snares in the film and the fact that we from this film at least a little frozen in the back it also did not become the only positive in the film was the whole unraveling of the film at the very end, which was certainly interesting, but not unexpected. I rate this film as below average and sometimes boring, but certainly not as the worst."
" remake?
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,4,"The twist, arriving over an hour in, was pretty great, but what came before and after was subpar. The production values were pretty good, with the notable exception of the building of horror/suspense pacing and tension."
" Decent film: better if recast
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,7,"The first time I watched this, I zoned out and only clocked back in at the end to that little twist. So I watched it again and it's a little bit of a slow burner but I think it's worth it for the twist at the end. Could have been a little more exciting; it's not scary enough. I would have liked this to be a little darker with a few more twists embedded in there but it's definitely a good watch. I liked Isla Fisher in this....however everyone else needed to be recast. The other characters lacked depth and the actors didn't do good jobs in bringing the most out in those characters."
" A reasonable 82 minutes
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,6,"A young couple take over a Californian vineyard and the pregnant wife starts suffering terrifying visions but her husband does not. This is a Blumhouse production, that is not a guarantee of quality but this one is a reasonable spooky movie. It is not terribly scary or gory and the acting is adequate but there is an interesting twist regarding the cause of Eveleigh's visions, I am not going to divulge what but the far superior French movie Inside (2007) springs to mind.
Not a movie that I would want to watch again, pretty forgettable but slightly better than much of the horror drivel that gets churned out these day."
" Haunting with a twist
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,6,"Visions: After a car accident a couple, Eveleigh and David relocate to a vineyard in California. At a welcoming party Eveleigh notices one of the guests acting as if possessed. She then starts to have strange visions of a hooded figure and bloody scenes. Poltergeist effects occur and she's pushed through a window by a mannequin. Typical haunted house horror/mystery but with an interesting plot twist. Some disturbing scenes of an average nature. A bit uneven paced but the tension does ratchet up for the final 20 minutes. Directed by Kevin Greutert and written by Lucas Sussman. Showing again on the Horror Channel on Thursday 1 October at 11.10 pm. 6/10."
" Well-written creepy mystery
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,7,"I haven't heard of this movie before, but was glad I randomly chose to watch it on Netflix. The plot starts out a bit generic, but - like wine with time - it gets better. A couple from the city moves to a vineyard in the countryside for a fresh start, but weird things start happening in their dream house. Only the wife Eveleigh (Isla Fisher) can see these supernatural occurrences, so her husband believes they're hallucinations caused by her mental health. From here, the story follows Eveleigh on a journey to uncover the mystery of these supernatural events - and if they're even real.Even though the audience can see the supernatural phenomena Evelyn experiences, there's also a ""paranoia"" aspect of the film which is set up to make the viewer question whether what we're seeing is real or just a figment of Eveleigh's imagination. This adds to the mystery of the film. Of course the audience wants to know the origins of the supernatural events (ghosts? demons? ancient curse?), but there's an added layer of whether the audience can even trust a protagonist with a history of mental health issues. This keeps the story intriguing.As for the film's horror factor, I thought it was more creepy than scary. There are some cheap jump scares which are easily anticipated, but I think the movie shines on its mystery and tense moments. The film really fills you with dread and keeps you in suspense of what could happen next.The acting was ok. Isla Fisher did a good job at playing the protagonist who seems paranoid to others, but is convinced her supernatural experiences are real. However, there were also some scenes where she should've turned up the volume on her emotions and acted more terrified to match the situation. The supporting cast had a few big names, but were mostly insignificant roles except in one scene.The ending is when the viewer will ultimately judge the movie. I thought the ending was creative, original and tied up the mystery nicely. But I can also see how some viewers could think it's cheesy or tries too hard. ""To each their own.""I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it for a good creepy mystery."
" good but predictable
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,6,"I had the antagonist pinned in the first 30 minutes and knew what was going on and how it would end.
i still give it a 6.1 for good acting from a bunch of a listers and a couple b listers6.1"
" Standard mediocre horror
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,5,"Acting wasn't great, all of the interactions between characters seemed disingenuous. The story isn't all that original. The majority of scary visions relied on loud sounds instead of scary sights. Still good for a background movie while you're doing something else."
" Just another horror with the Same script. Again.
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,6,Please stop using the Same plot over and over again. This movie is just like 99% of all other 'horror' movies.I've got to admit I liked the ripples through time concept. Actually that's the only reason I give it a 6 and not a 4. But other than that I found this movie very predictable.Cheap and easy writing. Screenplay and character weren't bad but certainly not good either. If you're Seen a few horror movies this one won't surprise you in any way. If it's your first horror please enjoy the ride... But I'll Bake a cake
" Very entertaining.
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,6,"I like the nice novela twist it has at the end.
The storyline was interesting, it made me jump from my sit a couple of times."
" I genuinely didn't see it coming..
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,10,"I find it difficult to be surprised in movies these days, especially the paranormal ones. But I genuinely didn't see that coming.****SPOILER***
I mean they set it up to where you went one way thinking it was all some weird Indian burial ground, some weird kinda thing like that. Especially with the findings in his office of printed out information like that.
The only thing I saw coming, was Sadie being the mother of the child that died in the car accident. I genuinely didn't expect for it to turn out to not be paranormal activity but premonitions."
" Could be a Lifetime Halloween movie. Total garbage.
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,1,"I was hopeful when I saw Jim Parsons was in the cast. I have to assume he was killing time, or fired his agent shortly after. This movie truly stinks. Bad script. Over acting. Stay away."
" Good idea, poor execution
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,4,"It was meh, too on the nose when you find out what's really happening.Bummed because the cast are some of my favorites. But they are clearly comedians. This business of comedy and tragedy will be harmonious, isn't always the case. First and foremost the husband deserved to be stabbed, it's like he was waiting for her to stab him. The nickel thing, it's like someone thought that was a red door knob thing, if the sequence already played out, how is that even relevant at the end? Eva, what were you doing missy? My favorite wasJoanna Cassidy, the 80's are calling and they want their cheap, red hair dye and their shoulder pads back. She was such a out of place, pointless character. Like I said ,""meh""."
" Very underrated movie!
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,10,The plot of the movie is simply amazing! I never expected such ending! Great movie!
" this is a bad movie
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,1,"Do filmmakers not understand that you can make a suspenseful and eerie movie without horrible jump scares with blaring sound effects? it looks like no one is having a good time making this pile of crap. every actor phones in the flat lines from the mediocre script with robotic monotony. it plods along, wasting most of its scant 80 minute runtime on the aforementioned jump scares, doing nothing with any of it until it crescendos into an incredibly idiotic ending. absolute waste of time."
" THIS IS NOT ROSEMARY'S BABY - I enjoyed this film
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,8,"I was expecting the modern day version of Rosemary's baby, but it's not. It was a pretty good movie overall and I tend to be somewhat hard to please. It was a slow build up and lots of twists and turns. It was great for a night's entertainment. I was expecting some overly gory supernatural film, but I was pleasantly surprised and the details that came to light as the film went on."
" An interesting movie, but nothing amazing.
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,6,"The movie is good ... the story is not that impressive, and what happen in movie isnt that scary.The jumpscares arent that good not even the weird sounds don't improve them.
The movie makes no sense until the end when everything starts to have a sense. :)Over all was a good movie, nice and relaxing ambience, but nothing horror and not even the mystery part wasn't that impressive."
" A complete rip-off
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,2,"Great movie that'll pull you in for the long haul, but once it starts coming to an end, it's hard not to see how much was stolen and taken from the 2008 French film INSIDE, which is totally superior to this let-down"
" Very much the destination, not the journey.
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,4,Overall tedious slow burn that feels way more like a lifetime movie for the most part.Trivial details of life and the seemingly innocuous visions don't really do much especially since none of the characters have much depth to them.It all comes together in the end quite cleverly but it is so not worth the wait.
" Enjoyable if generic supernatural effort
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,7,"After opening a winery with her husband, a woman starts to believe that her sightings of a strange ghost on the property are more than just signs of her stressful pregnancy and begins to dig into the troubled past of the location unraveling a more dangerous conspiracy than she ever imagined.For the most part, this one wasn't all that bad. One of the more enjoyable aspects to this one is a series of exceptionally creepy sequences that showcase the supernatural antics in action. The early scenes that start to hint something are going on, from the freakout in the living room to the frantic nightmare she has which start this one off rather nicely. The fact that these are tied together involving her burgeoning pregnancy, including the more receptive state she's in because of that which allows her other freakouts to have a far more pronounced weight to them that adds an extra touch to the film. By giving this a decidedly rational reasoning for why she might be having these visions and experiences in the form of her hormones being off-kilter because of the pregnancy, there's a decidedly fine overview here that brings this into quite creepy setups at times. That carries over into the fine investigation that takes over most of the film. With the desire to understand why she's being attacked and tormented so frequently in the house, the idea of investigating the various incidents at the house in the past sparks the usual series of investigations into the area. Finding the usual assortment of articles detailing the potential targets as to what happened, there's enough of a build-up here to generate a rough sense of what's happening rather nicely which is what fuels the fine later half here. That this series of investigations spawns the fine finale, getting the true hint of their search and a fun twist into what it all means in terms of action really generates some fun here, there's enough to hold itself up over its minor flaws. One of the biggest issues with this one is the fact that there's just nothing really extraordinary about the idea presented here. It really boils down to a stereotypical case of strangers moving into a new house and experiencing supernatural actions that only she believes, causing those around her to believe she's crazy which isn't helped at all by the entire lack of gore in the attacks here. The other issue here is the fact that the finale's twist drops all the supernatural antics and goes straight for the more humanistic twist that really doesn't do much for the previous action in the film. Otherwise, there isn't much wrong here.Rated Unrated/R: Violence, Language and intense scenes with pregnant women."
" Interesting and entertaining suspense tense thriller that proves the past can haunt!
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,8,"Just saw a film called ""Visions"" that was really interesting and entertaining it was the kind that kept you on the edge of your seat all while thrilling with tense dark moments of shadows and paranormal events! The story is pretty simple a married couple David(Anson Mount) and Eveleigh Maddox(the sexy and beautiful Isla Fisher) leave the fast paced city life of L.A. behind for the beauty of the California country side when they move into a wine vineyard like town. Eve is pregnant, yet slowly but surely she starts to hear and see strange things like hooded figures in the shadows and objects start to move oddly. No one believes her, yet local history and research proves this vineyard has some of a past haunted history! Yet a subplot lies underneath as that is the real horror of this dark tale as the past can haunt you, plus Isla's character also has a damsel in distress scene in which her mouth is duct taped. Overall good to the point dark suspense thriller that twist with a revealing shock!"
" I loved this movie!!!👍
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,10,"I think there may be some sort of gender difference involved in most of the bad reviews here; especially those by critics. *side note: Females are irritatingly under- represented by the lack of female critics for this genre.😒* Anyhoo, I'm a woman that is pretty much obsessed with horror, thriller, and psychological films. My friends think I'm crazy because of my preference. My boyfriend can't sleep well and jumps😲 during movies that barely muster a flinch from me.😴 HOWEVER, I could barely handle the last fifteen minutes of this movie, my heart was pounding out of my chest😱. This movie hits you where it hurts, at your biggest vulnerability! (You'll know what I mean after you've watched.) The plot, though supernatural, is logical and believable (at least for me.) I began watching because I adore Jim Parsons😍, but by the end I was a huge fan of Isla Fisher 😃. Listen ladies, this is a great horror film without much gore and it's something you and your man can watch together. He may like this less than you, but only an egomaniac would complain about it in general!😉"
" An acceptable movie for a Sunday at 2PM.
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,5,"I caught this on cable. It's not too good, and you laugh about some details, but the ending makes it up. The acting is not very good."
" Premonitions, Lack of Chemistry and Stupid Conclusion
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,5,"After a car crash where the baby of the other driver dies, Eveleigh Maddox (Isla Fisher) is declared non-guilty for the accident. One year later, her husband David Maddox (Anson Mount) invests all their savings in a vineyard and they move to start a new life in the countryside. When Eveleigh learns that she is pregnant, she stops taking her pills to protect her baby. Soon she has strange visions and daydreams in the house and David believes it is a side effect for not taking her medicine. Meanwhile Eveleigh befriends the also pregnant Sadie (Gillian Jacobs) at the gym and meets the connoisseur and critic of fine wines Helena (Joanna Cassidy). David convinces Eveleigh´s doctor Dr. Mathison (Jim Parsons) to prescribe her medicine again. But when she stops using the pills again, the visions return. What is the secret of the house and Eveleigh´s visions?""Visions"" is an intriguing horror film about a woman with visions. The plot has no gore and holds the attention of the viewer. However, the lack of chemistry between the protagonists Isla Fisher and Anson Mount, and the stupid conclusion destroy the promising film. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""A Última Premonição"" (""The Last Premonition"")"
" WOW
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,7,"Refreshing topic, perfectly shot and excellent acting. The scenery was beautiful too.I don't understand the low rating by so many people. I particularly give it a 7/10"
" Meh. Blame It On The Direction
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,3,"They say good direction can make or break a movie. Consider this one broken beyond repair. The acting is sub par (including Joanna Cassidy, Jim Parsons, and Eva Longoria) but you can blame it on the direction. The facial expressions are laughable but you can blame it on the direction. The physical fight scenes are amateurish but you can blame it on the direction. Perhaps with a better director this might have been a 7 or 8 star film.You can bet your bottom dollar (or nickel), to coin a phrase, that there will be a sequel. Hopefully the producers will opt for a more talented director next time."
" ""Visions"": Not a Half-Bad Watch
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,6,"And a titch or two above half-good. This tale of a spooky house harboring terrifying premonitions may not be anything all that new, but it's relatively well acted and the California wine vineyard aesthetic is competently captured. Furthermore, it bears mention that lead Isla Fisher rocks a revealing '70's retro look in a couple scenes here with stunning savoir-faire.Strut on, girl."
" Nifty little supernatural horror film
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Pregnant Eveleigh Maddox (a fine and affecting performance by Isla Fisher) moves with her husband David (a solid and credible portrayal by Anson Mount) to a vineyard to start a new life in the wake of a traumatic automobile accident. However, Eveleigh finds out that said vineyard has a dark past that puts both her and her baby in danger. Director Kevin Greubert relates the engrossing premise at a gradual pace, makes nice use of the beautiful bucolic setting, grounds the premise in a believable everyday reality, and ably crafts a spooky and unsettling enigmatic atmosphere. Fisher and Mount make for an attractive and appealing couple; they receive sturdy support from Gillian Jacobs as the perky Sadie, Joanna Cassidy as the helpful Helena, Eve Longoria as loyal gal pal Eileen, and Jim Parsons as the concerned Dr. Matheson. Lucas Sussman's clever script delivers a real doozy of a surprise twist at the end. Both Anton Sanko's shivery score and Michael Fimognari's polished widescreen cinematography are up to par. Well worth a watch."
" Will definitely hold ur attention. Avoid reading too much about this film.
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,6,"Saw this recently on a dvd which i own.
The plot is about a couple who decide to make a fresh start by moving away from the city but the countryside doesnt seem to help as the wife is tormented by terrible visions.
Kevin Greutert being an editor himself, he did a mighty fine job with the editing n direction department. The film moves at a decent pace n has some solid moments of tension. The suspense is maintained throughout n the ending is satisfying.
The countryside setting is beautiful. There is not much gore or killings nor it is scary but the film will definitely hold your attention.
Avoid reading too much about this film as it can spoil the mystery element. I dont know y some fellas tried to compare this with another film, especially in the trivia section. Plz dont read the trivia section. Also, a Bollywood film Phobia has copied the idea from this film."
" Good, but...
",2018-03-14 00:00:00,7,"I liked the film - the build up was good and the twist was interesting. However, one thing I cannot stand is where someone is in a fight with someone else and a third person just stands there, mouth open, doing absolutely nothing. This is what happens when David has the fight in the kitchen and his wife just stands there and does nothing to help him - especially when she already knows what will happen from her previous visions. People like this deserve to die because they are not worthy of the gene pool.If that hadn't happened (and it need not have done - she could have been detained by fighting off the guy with the rifle) I would have given the film 9/10."
" Mommy Sense
",2018-02-20 00:00:00,8,"Eveleigh (Isla Fisher) Was in a car accident and got a nasty bump on the head and killed an infant. It wasn't her fault, or so everyone claims. Her husband David (Anson Mount) manages to get own vineyard and her pregnant. The neighbors feel like something out of ROSEMARY'S BABY. She thinks the neighbor is producing meth, but he claims it is medicinal olive oil, something my aromatherapist swears by. The old house also has a history. Eveleigh has visions and hears things too which they didn't work into the title. This starts off as your typical boring poltergeist haunting and then at 54 minutes into the film, when you have your first death, things get interesting.Cast includes Eva Longoria, Jim Parsons and Gillian Jacobs.Guide: No f-bombs. Brief sex. No nudity."
" Don't watch this late at night
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,2,"Everyone is so quiet and soft-spoken throughout the movie, but whenever there's a jump-scare (and there's lots of them) they are so loud they make you jump out of your seat. I couldn't watch this in the end without deafening myself and waking the neighbours because I had to turn the volume up high to hear the cast speaking and then the speakers would get blasted out by bangs and screams. I like jump scares but this was just annoying."
" lesser Blumhouse
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,4,"Eveleigh (Isla Fisher) and David Maddox (Anson Mount) get into a car wreck which killed a child in the other car. After Eveleigh's recovery, they move to a small town to reopen a vineyard. She's newly pregnant and befriends fellow pregnant Sadie (Gillian Jacobs). Eveleigh has visions and investigates suspicious local happenings.Blumhouse is killing it producing small lower-budget horrors and once in awhile, hits one over the fence. This is not one of those home runs. This is Rosemary's Baby without its artistry or originality. The reveal is obvious from the start. The movie hits that dead child note so awkwardly loud that it is impossible not to come back. Overall, this has a little creepy vibe but nothing that scary. The jump scares don't scare. I like everybody here but they're not pushing any boundaries. This horror is mostly flat."
" An interesting take, but nothing completely new...
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,5,"After a pregnant woman moves in her new house with her loving husband, she starts seeing strange visions.The movie starts up interesting, the character themselves are pretty well done. Though I was more interested by some side characters then our main protagonist. That's where the movie loses me a bit, though the actors do a great job, they don't have a lot to work with, some simple things are thrown in there to squish everything up, so we can care for these people. But at the end it just doesn't work very well. The movie tries to do something clever, though I didn't see the ending coming, it might be just because it was a little boring and hard to pay attention to. I can see a number of times the director tried to build atmosphere and tension, but it quickly falls apart by the numerous jump-scares it has littered about. There was so many times in the movie where I jumped just because of a loud noise and that is a problem. Some things are not explained in the ending which I can't get into without spoiling so I won't talk about it, but beside that we also have a very,very uninteresting ending of all. I wasn't afraid for the woman or her husband, I was more interested about the past it sets up with this house but never delivers. Sound: Nothing special for a horror movie Directing: It has some good shots, though it doesn't play with our mind quite as well as I hoped it would because of these visions. Story: The story is lackluster, had potential, but ultimately failed.Overall this is an average movie at best: 5/10"
" A ""The Psychic"" copy
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,3,"Watch ""The psychic"" AKA ""Sette note in nero"" by Lucio Fulci and you'll realise where this movie has been copied from. The movie is ""OK"" for a boring afternoon but seriously... no suspense, not scary enough for a ""horror"" and please... everything has been seen tons of time over in other movies."
" review from an ordinary bloke and his son
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,8,"From a couple of Avid Film and TV watchers, I've got to say, Out of all the films and Christmas TV we have both watched over the festive period, This has got to be the viewing highlight for both of us, It has provided suspense , intrigue and had us both drawn in from the beginning up to a cracking end.If like us you are not one of those ""Oh I went to Uni and got a Degree in Media Studies, and I know lighting,script writing,ETC"" and all that upper class B.S, But an ordinary film enjoy-er, then fill your boot's, forget the world kick off you're shoes have a couple of Beer's and see the film for what it really is a bit of well done entertainment."
