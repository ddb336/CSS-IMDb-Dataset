",2021-04-07 00:00:00,1,"Where the gore in that movie? All stupid cgi , it was so bad like a dumb kid movie, better make it animated."
" DECENT REMAKE!!
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,6,"The original is considered a classic and the sequels not so much but this remake that was released 7 years ago to heavy criticism tothe point it wasnt quite fair. Set in 2028 with a cast that included Gary Oldman, Samuel L Jackson and Michael Keaton and had some pretty fun over the top action scenes which is at the heart of even the original. It looked well produced just the story was very meh so those who want a bit of creative writing instead of ott gunfights are going to be disappointed but lets be clear, this is easily the second best RoboCop movie made to date."
" Robocop 3 is better than this
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,5,"Wow what a disappointment, just one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This could have been rated pg. all of the other robocops, least all the movies are better than this, even robocop 3 is better than this. I've even seen the the tv series and mini series they are on par with this which is very shameful"
" worst robocop film ever
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,1,"I just made a user to write this review.
If you're gonna do a scene set on a country how hard is it just to google the name of the city and get an idea of what it looks like, literally just google and go images, how hard is that. Rather than offending foreign people like all their cities look the same, they all wear the same hats... like nobody in tehran ever wears those cool arab hats or turbans, we just don't , but really all they had to do was google tehran and click images to see what people look or dress like.the same laziness or lack of effort appears in the scientific aspect of the film, the script, cinematography and everything else, pure trash"
" Backup
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,10,Pretty good remake. Lots of violence but the original had better jokes
" Oh my God that was the best movie i've seen in years
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,10,"The CGI the story the acting even the plot everything was really freaking good , omgg wow, cool as hell"
" Fetishes violence
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,2,"Fetishizes violence, with none of the inspired satire of the original."
" This movie is a perfect reboot. No wonder Hollywood is ruined with overrated MCU movies
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,9,This movie is perfect modern day Robocop. I don't get the hate and nonsense. Please don't compare this with old one.
" Underrated
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,9,"Although studio interference does prevent the film from reaching the heights it had the potential to do, Robocop is hardly just another unnecessary remake, but a firm worldbuilding experience and a new take on an iconic franchise that is done, despite the circumstances, quite well. I'll start with my problems with the film. The first 20-25 minutes of the film, aka the exposition, is a bit bland. There's nothing too original about that part of the film, and it honestly seems like the studio tried to make the story as simple as possible in order to not upset audiences- providing them with familiar structures as other big budget action films of this time, like the Transformers franchise. Besides that, I have almost no problems with the rest of the film. The acting, the performances, the worldbuilding, and the direction is all really good. I love the new look of Robocop himself, the CGI is spectacular for only 2014, and I really enjoyed the casting of Joel Kinnaman as Alex Murphy himself, who seems to be a great recast for the role required. I love Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton in the film as way, both playing almost peculiar opposites, but both providing an excellent job. I found it to be rather entertaining throughout, some of the action scenes are rather impressive, for at least past its exposition. In the end, Robocop (2014) is a surprisingly decent remake that has its flaws, but I wouldn't mind enjoying again sometime soon.
My Rating: 8.75/10"
" Ok nothing on original
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,6,I think it's ruined with a 12a rating they should no that anyone who loves the original will watch this it needed to be at least 15 rating. I found it to shiny and colourful. Needed to be darker. But if i has never seen the original it's a pretty good film
" It's RoboCop with a massive upgrade and he's so good!
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,7,"80s and 90s generation will obviously love this. When RoboCop was released in the 80s it was so much ahead of it's time, kids loved everything about it. The memory of that getting incorporated with this one is pretty easy and since this one looks so snazzy and explores the family so well makes it more loveable. Being a RoboCop fan I'd love to see a sequel to this, maybe explore the idea of commander cable as well."
" Definitley not garbage
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,7,"People wanted this movie to fail because it is in a long list of much maligned reboots such as the terminator franchise.But this reboot does make an effort while paying homage to the original.Robocop 1984 can be summarised as follows;""Good cop arrives at his new job in downtown Detroit. In pursuit of bad guys, he finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time and is horrifically murdered. His corpse his saved and he is resurrected as a monotone law enforcement machine.""Today's Robocop gives more insight into Alex Murphy, the man, BEFORE his rebirth. He's not just a beat cop new to the precinct. He's a seasoned detective and is digging around too closely to his dirty colleagues. Even before he gets his upgrade, he demonstrates his capability as a tough gun slinging cop with a job to keep the streets clean.There is also an attempt to explain the science behind his recreation.In 1984, you didn't ask too many questions about how or why Robocop functions in certain ways and the creators didn't really tell.In the remake, they cleverly explain what it takes to get Alex to behave like the Robocop we all know and how to get him to become Alex again. Gary Oldman is the benevolent scientist who rebuilt Alex and tries to integrate him back into the world, often with devastating and unpredictable results.I say give it a chance.I'm a huge fan of the 80/90s robot movies like Terminator and Robocop.But where Terminator movies (post Judgement Day) fall flat without attempting to connect with any of the original source material, this new Robocop gives it a good shot.I'm not really sure what detractors would've done differently."
" Bruh...
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,5,"Good idea, but really bad implementation.
The main problem that there's no real vilien, so the first half of the movie is good, but
in the second half there's nothing interest.
I didn't regret to watch but still not good one."
" It's not a remake, but a completely new reboot!
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,8,"This updated version of our ol' beloved Alex Murphy bring us with a plethora of topics I don't remember seeing in the original movie, i.e.: the war-against-crime propaganda we are all so used nowadays from our bootless politicians, the bioethical human-vs-machine dilemma that starts to overkill us more and more, or the corporate vested interests in every aspect of our daily lives... to name a few.Though I'm not a big fan of the RoboCop franchise (I didn't even know there was a 2014 version, and having watched RC1 three or four times - RC2 only one), this refreshened view just blew me away.Recommended for people with informed opinion for a better joy!"
" Pretty well done
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,8,"Things could have really gone south with a remake, but not this one. It was solid."
" Underrated. Great movie 10/10
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,10,"This is actually a very VERY solid movie. This movie have everything you can expect from a Robocop movie and more. Great acting, great directing. Top notch!"
" Another Recycled Trope
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,3,"This has such forced social commentary it falls into the realm of trying way too hard to make its point it becomes laughable.Everyone is so one dimensional I didnt really care if they lived or died. Hollywood also needs to just stop using the ""you threatened my family so now i have to kill a bunch of people"" trope. It's old.This is just more lazy filmmaking."
" Video game or movie ?
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,6,Why did half the movie feel like I'm watching a video game of how much target left alive ?. Ruined classic. Typical Hollywood..should of been left untouched. Give it a miss if you will and the wooden acting by the lead i guess was suited for the role.
" Loved it
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,10,"So much hate . its so good . its a reboot . don't compare it to the first one . watching it with a open mind .
I loved it great actors great cgi too"
" Poorly Written
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,4,"You always have to be careful with remakes. This one was awful. The story was disorganized in that they tried to somewhat follow the original storyline but made some random changes that made no sense. The main character was really weak, it was so hard to like him or sympathize with him. The antagonists were also weak, their plot was difficult to identify let alone get into. I was most annoyed by the the trademark one liners being randomly inserted into the dialogue totally losing the nostalgia. The CGI was about the only thing that was very well done. Too bad, supporting cast such as Micheal Keaton and Gary Oldmans talent was wasted on this film."
" Better than the original
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,9,"I'm not usually much for remakes, but don't let the low average rating fool you. Die-hard fans of the first RoboCop can't bear to give it a decent score, nor those who walked in looking for gore, and only found a thoughtful, intelligent thriller.B-movie director Paul Verhoeven may have declared his original superior, but the new RoboCop dispenses with the first movie's juvenile sense of humor and over-the-top violence, and and replaces it with better writing, and a better cast of actors.Gary Oldman is as good as ever, along with Michael Kenneth Williams, Abbie Cornish, Jay Baruchel, Michael Keaton, Samuel Jackson.While at times predictable, RoboCop 2014 takes you on a serious journey down the rabbit hole of our worst fears about robotics and artificial intelligence."
" Total surprise
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,10,I absolutely hate remakes. Imagine my surprise to be totally wrong about this movie. Makes the original ahead of its time. Good job
" Watch the original instead...
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,5,"An average if watchable film that is outdone by its 28 year old predecessor in practically every way. So what was the point? Oh yeah, silly me - to make money. Michael Keaton was superb though...."
" CAN'T REMAKE A CLASSIC!!!
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,1,"LET ME BE CLEAR AND PRECISE FOR YA'LL!
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO COMPARING THIS RIDICULOUS REMAKE TO THE CLASSIC ORIGINAL!
YOU CAN'T REMAKE PERFECTION!
YOU CAN'T REMAKE A CLASSIC!"
" More streamlined than the original
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,6,"This film doesn't include much of the satire of corporate America that pervaded the original. Well, it does have some, but it is no longer a novel point these days so it does not stand out. This time, the visuals and action stand out. However, it is let down by the lack of a compelling actor and human element."
" Good action-SF-satire movie
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,8,"I grew up watching the RoboCop movies, cartoons and shows. I recently watched all of the movies and while I still like 'em, there are not really as good as I remembered them.And, unpopular opinion alert, I do believe this is the best movie in the franchise.Yes, it isn't as gory as the first ones but it's way more intelligent, in my opinion. Also, the remake has better actors. Samuel L Jackson and Gary Oldman stand out. Joel Kinnaman did a fine job, he was credible in the role and in some scenes he was actually very good. Michael Keaton was also good.It's not a perfect movie. It's not a 10/10. But if you like SF, you definitely should watch this movie!"
" A solid remake
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,7,"Not gonna waste your time with one of those lengthy reviews, so here's a simple list of pros and cons and a short summary of my thoughts:
On par with the original film, a great looking and pretty dark (could be darker though) movie to watch for both fans of the first installment and newcomers alike. Don't know what the 1/10 reviewers were expecting, looks like they forgot the original Robocop was just ""OK"" and not a masterpiece in any way. Just watch this and have fun.PROS
+ managed to live up to the spirit of original Robocop
+ lots of easter eggs for those that know the original
+ smuggles some quasi-philosophical questions about post-humanism if you like such stuff
+ looks great
+ Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton were greatCONS
completely wasted the potential of Samuel L. Jacksonnot as dark and brutal as the original Robocop"
" The film that shouldn't have been
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,1,"Love it or hate it, this is a film that should never have existed. No one thought that Robocop needed a remake, and if a studio was wants a cyborg movie then they should make a new cyborg movie.
Even with its ties with the successful original and the stolen premise, this sloppy copycat manages to become ultra boring within 10 minutes, due to the terrible script, plastic acting, irritating all over the place score, and obviously the final result comes across as something being put together like a 2 hour long music video for kids who are fans of Justin Bieber and will watch anything as long as it's got shiny visuals. Well, guess what: even they didn't particularly like this crap, so this abortion has now landed where it belongs, in the Wastelands Of Forgetfulness, and it's there to stay. And rightly so."
" Had Some Great Ideas but The Family Arc Just Made The Whole Thing Depressing 📡
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,5,"It was Just Lacklustre in the End. It should of just been an action packed ride.Ideas:° The Idea of The Company Trying to Convince the Public of Putting The Robots out on the Street was Interesting.° The Cyborg vs The Robot Idea was Great.Overall, it was actually just depressing throughout much of the Movie because of the Family Element and what Robocop Really looks like.It was Lacklustre and could of been way better."
" This movie is very hit and miss for me. But overall its pretty solid.
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,7,First off I'm big Joel Kinnaman he might not be huge household name but hes very good and serviceable actor for quite sometime. Robocop I'm also fan of the games and previous entries. With that in mind my review does have some biased to it but in order to share my fair opinion with everyone I'd like to list things I enjoyed and ones I diddn't to much.Things I liked:The acting was very well done in this on all parts and it had some pretty big names in this feature. The emotional touch with his family did add a nice layer to to the character. The premise of the movie wasn't bad and there wasn't any plot holes which usually is happens in movies like this.Things I hated:This movie is very bereft of action. If you're going to this expecting bloodbath think again. I think in entire runtime of the movie to say there was 20 minutes worth of total action might be being a little generous. The story while engaging at times because extremely dragged out. I found myself several times during the movie wanting to fast forward just so something to get going. Virtually no humor in this movie at all maybe one joke I half laughed at but other then that is very dry and serious for the most part.Overall this movie is still not bad movie by any means but it isn't a masterpiece. Had it not been my love of Joel or the series itself I really could of rated 5 but I'll leave this at a 7.
" Good
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,8,The movie is fine.. story is fast phase.. recommend to watch this first and don't mind the critics rating.
" I can see why its hated and liked
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,5,"I don't care for the fact it relies so heavily on his kid/wife cause that hasn't been done 80x over in every other generic action film. The fact they tried so hard to make a movie that was one of the most goriest films back than now making it 'kid friendly' is a joke.Not to mention its overall story is cliche, and you can see the fact the detectives and the chief being the traitor right away. So many films/movies are doing this too. It needs to be the entire station or majority not just the chief and two others. Super troopers got it right and it was a freaking comedy.At the same time it does have its own little touch to it that makes it feel nice. Would I watch it again? Maybe if someone wanted to, it wasn't overly bad and I kinda want to see the rest of the world under OCP possibly."
" Enjoyable action slick
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,6,"Good: action scenes, special affects
Bad: nothing special in story, screenplay, direction.
I enjoyed the movie due to the action scenes"
" Both, the Original and This Remake, Are Great and Worth to Watch!
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,9,"The storyline was different from the original RoboCop movie!Here, the car exploded causing him to have Robot parts. The original was when he got body parts shot off by numerous bullets.There were more differences to the movie, but it was pretty similar.I think both the Original and this remake are great, and they are worth it to watch!Hope that was helpful. CGI may be horrible to some, but it is very entertaining and interesting."
" Pointless retelling
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,2,"A PG13 retelling of a absolute classic from my childhood. Completely unnecessary and pointless, not even close to the original. The only thing Iv enjoyed in this movie was Michael Keaton performance.
There is nothing remarkable here or worth remembering."
" Let's feel bad about a stoic family man.
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,3,"This version of Alex Murphy had no charm. He seemed to be bored with his family, then boom, a rigged bomb under his car maims him and he becomes Robocop and somehow we were supposed to pity him when he says he would rather die after seeing what was left of his body? The original Alex Murphy was a happy family man that adored his wife and son, who seemed to really be dedicated to his job as a police officer and his life was taken too soon. Discovering his humanity, he goes on a rampage of revenge on the group of thugs who killed him, and it turns out, OCP or OmniCorp, his own manufacturer is also his enemy to his remaining human conscience.This movie on the other hand, confuses on me on its very existence. Sure it's a retelling of an iconic 1980s action movie, but it's bad. Probably meant to appeal to younger people who never have seen the original 1987 film. This remake, like most remakes, are just a pain waste of Hollywood's time a money. Go make a proper reboot of Doom, or Max Payne. Not this."
" Why did you make this?
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,5,The first 10 min of the film was a really good cop movie but then it all went down hill. Way to much back story and emotion for RoboCop. It needed more action and the R rating would have helped a lot.
" A bad Robocop movie
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,1,"I didn't like this movie. This movie made no sense. The story was boring and uninteresting. It's nowhere near good as the original RoboCop. It's nice how this movie tried to be different, but it just didn't work somehow. It's clearly the worst RoboCop movie. I did like the attire of RoboCop. Thought that was really neat and cool. Really liked the helmet, and liked that the colour was black. It looked futuristic! It looked like it was from the year 2035 or something. But I still prefer the original RoboCop from the year 1987. That RoboCop is a classic! I enjoyed the little action towards the end. Actually, that was the only good part of the movie. Everything else was bad. Even a movie like RoboCop 3 is better than this movie. RoboCop 3 had an interesting story unlike this one. It's clearly the worst of the RoboCop movies. I was expecting something much better. People thought RoboCop 3 is a joke, but this RoboCop is an even bigger joke. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Just see it for yourselves. This is a movie I never want to see again. Once was enough if you ask me. The casting was bad. The only one they got right was Samuel L. Jackson even though he's my least favourite actor. I'm not a fan of him. He's someone that will look great in a RoboCop movie. I admit that. I can't believe this is a remake. The movie was poor. The original movie is still the best RoboCop. I'd be surprised if there is a sequel to this. It will be a bad thing. Actually, it will be a disaster! I definitely won't be watching it. It would be a waste of time. RoboCop was a joke!"
" robocop
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,6,"Was this reboot neceserey,no it wasnt and by that also comes predictabilite since it is easily to guess what will happen next,still i perfer this one compared to last two from 90s ,story in this film is shown in a better way then i was expecting but it still had some scenes that were slowing down film,lead actor was still likeable but he lacked more personality and impact on him wasnt so good shown when he become robot,and his connection to family wasnt so clearly explored mixed with to much expozition,come on let to audience to figure something alone,they dont need everything to be pushed in their faces,robocop is for me still better then previous two ones but far from being good as original"
" Better than I thought it would be
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,10,"So I went into this with very low expectation maybe that's I why it impressed me so much. I remember when ad for this first come out and I hated the idea of a remake I hated the look of the new robocop. But after watching it I must say they did it right. In that they didn't try to copy scene for scene the way some reboots have cough cough (2016 ghostbusters). If someone asked me to describe it. I'd say it a modern take on the classic robocop and while it's still a robocop movie it's not the same robocop movie. Which I think is a good thing I was afraid they would try that and fail miserably and no matter what they and any other reboot that tries 1 to 1 copy does.
But this movie wasn't afraid to do it's own thing.Sure it doesn't measure up to the original that defined the 80's/90's but no remake could trying to just lead to failure. I feel this is a fact people hating on this movie in the reviews don't understand. They're like where was this where was that from the original movie??? That wasn't in the original... The original had move feel... And on and on comparing it the the original. Go on read some of the 1 star review they are all like this.But for me who's been jagged by awful reboots this is a solid film. I give it 6/10 however as a reboot 10/10 because it respected the original by doing it's own thing yet still managed to keep the important parts something reboots rarely do.
(remember dragonball reboot)"
" Incredibly mediocre
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,5,"The film has a ton of action. It has some characterization. It has a bit of decent writing to it. But, none of it really had heart. It had all of these things, but they were all executed in mediocre fashion.Some action scenes also went on way too long, and became more of a chore to watch than being fun. The biggest perpetrator is the fight in the barn type place, and he's not supposed to get hit, yet he's standing still while 20 robots shoot at him and they all miss. These are robots with dead-eye aim, the very point of the previous scene where robots are more efficient than humans, but they can't hit this guy while he's standing still? It's just so corny.Sometimes, less is better, and they took everything in this movie and magnified it to where we just don't care. We always knew all of the characters were going to be fine, and there was just no tension whatsoever.It's not a bad movie persay, but it constantly treads the line of just barely average. Do not recommend unless you are extremely bored like I was. I watched Dredd right after this because I had never seen that either, and Dredd was way better. Watch that if you haven't seen that instead of this crap."
" Mildly interesting, but it seems to lose its way slightly in the second half
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,5,"2028 Detroit City; Officer Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is killed by a bomb that is detonated when he opens his car door. Although Murphy is critically injured he is given the chance to continue to serve as a police officer except that he will exist as a part-human part-robot owned by multi-national conglomerate OmniCorp. Trouble is OmniCorp have only ever used fully automated robots in the past and Murphy (still being in possession of his own brain and emotions) decides to pursue his own course of justice the consequences of which could have serious repercussions for OmniCorp.A very different beast than any of its predecessors director Jose Padilha has more or less removed nearly all of the satire and general digs at consumerism and greed and rolled out what I presume was intended to be a more straight-laced backstory on the evolution of Robocop.In the original Robocop film the same theme is touched upon only in much less detail (Robocop's emotional psyche and him forming memories). The difference between the 2 films is that the original film despite this not being the focus managed to pull this off with a degree of feeling and heart. Considering Robocop's human feelings and emotion psyche are a driver to the story it's surprising how unmoving I found a lot of what I witnessed. Murphy's wife and kid are not sufficiently developed and, in this film, I could never really see Murphy as this 'loving family man' father that was so well conveyed in the original - even though it was done in flashbacks it worked in the original. In this reboot I just didn't care for Murphy in the same way that I did in the original film.The film is also a little heavy-going and serious and the odd moments of humour that are dotted around the film don't come off all that well. Keaton's line of 'I wouldn't buy that for a dollar' comes off as particularly forced and clumsy. The Tin Man gag was mildly amusing once, but becomes less funny each time it's used and the Wizard Of Oz music that was used during a shootout was odd to say the least.Given the talent on board here the acting is surprisingly mediocre; Kinnaman is quite good when he needs to act like a machine and is a good screen presence, but when it comes to the human side of his character if you'll pardon the expression then he isn't much 'cop' (groan). Keaton can be good when the role and material are right, but he seems miscast here and lacks the evil touch required for such a role (particularly when compared to how good Ronny Cox was in the original film). Oldman is the best of a fairly average bunch of performers and is probably the only person who I would say puts on a good show. Cornish is bland and Earle Haley is not used particularly well though I suspect he would have shone with a bigger role in the film.This reboot/remake or whatever you want to call it is a poor relation to the 1987 version and it has to be said that Verhoeven melded violence, vengeance, satire and pathos with a degree of skill and panache. In this reboot the first 2 elements are present, but the lack of the other 2 elements render it a fairly average film that could have been so much better. It's a shame that the strong first half involving the development of a robot with human feelings ends up descending into a generic revenge piece in its second half which it's very hard to care about and one which I can safely say I had little vested interest in.To sum up then, it very much stands in the shadow of the original although in this film's defence it is, at the very least, better than both Robocop 2 and 3."
" I like robocop movies
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,3,"If you play.. Story in this movie is.. Same as the first part of the original movie.. Which i don't like is the fight... Its like they were playing a game.. People like to see the revange. Or the real metter

" Where is my sequel?
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,7,Honestly it was not a bad take/reboot. It was better than 90% of rebbot/remakes.I thought it would have gotten a sequel. I still would like one.I mean its not on the level of the 1980s version but hey I still liked this one.
" Good enough, but not better...
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,5,"The moto for this film must have been ""bigger and better"", which is understandable considering all the films out there competing for attention. The action sequences were good, but not spectacular. The acting was good, but not great. I didn't find Joel Kinnaman believable enough as Murphy/Robocop. Although most of his suit was an actual suit, it didn't look nearly as impressive as the 1987 suit. Some of the visuals were also clearly CGI/Blue/Green Screen and not entirely believable.The film didn't blow me away as I wanted it to, and became formulaic. I also found it way too American. Everything revolved around ""The American people"" and ""Americans"" to the point where it became annoying. And the American flag was everywhere - so patriotic! CGI is all over the show in this film, and at times completely unnecessary. Even the office decor was CGI!! Worst of all, it was so obvious. Why, just why???I can commend the film on its family values. Murphy actually has a family in this film and the bond between them was sincere and touching. Pity his son didn't feature more in the film. Although not a bad film in general, I didn't find it intriguing enough."
" Absolute abomination
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,4,"This movie is a dried piece of turd on a warm summers day. 4 stars for the actors doing their best. -6 stars for forgetting the message of the original movie, for removing the soul of a heroic character, and for turning something brutal into a kitten. Everyone involved should be ashamed."
" I cannot stand this remake

" A dull, lifeless, unnecessary, useless not worthy remake to the original 1987 masterpiece
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,1,"This movie come out in 2014 and it is a soulless film. It is dull, lifeless, unnecessary, useless not worthy remake to the original 1987 masterpiece. I love the original RoboCop (1987) to death huge fan of that bloody Rated - R sci-fi action film. RoboCop (1987) Is a masterpiece that is equal with Bade Runner, Star Wars, and Back to the Future. RoboCop 2 (1990) get criticism but it is an ultra violent sci-fi action sequel flick miles way better movie than the god damn awful terrible remake!I hate this movie it is forgettable I don't have this film in my collection I did watch this film three times in the row because I forgot about what it was about. It is PG-13 again a family film disrespectful. I do not like it is a family film again! The action scenes are lame, boring forgattable because they aren't any. Just like RoboCop 3 it suffers from bad script, bad actors and really missing action scens. Terrible CGI effects. Joel Kinnaman is really disrespectful actor thowards veteran actor Peter Weller and the original RoboCop movie. Kinnaman was complaning about the suit, he was really dick about it. I read an article in which at the time when this movie was filming actor Michael Keaton had no emotions thowards Kinnaman complaning about his suit. I support Michael Ketaon's decision but this movie is still a god damn awful.This movie has no action, it has no soul and heart. Lewis in this movie is black but the character is useless. Chief Karen Dean (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) sold out Alex Murphy. Why the character is called Murphy trough whole movie and not RoboCop? Why he has black suit with human hand on it really sucks. He is blown to pieces by a car bomb and when he wokes up he runs away and wines, cries like a little 10 year old he is, that he is a cyborg now when he is a cry baby and stupid as day and night. I hate this film! I hate this god damn film! I hate this film!!!!!I hate Joel Kinnaman, I hate Abbie Cornish I hate Gary Oldman I hate everyone in this movie. José Padilha does not know how to direct a good movie. This movie bombed thank god. RoboCock 2014 is boring, lame awful not making sense story. It is a pile of dog sh**. RoboCop doesn't do nothing trough this whole movie. This is even worse than RoboCop 3 this movie sucks big ass. It is awful it is garbage i hate it! This was unnecessary remake I have not watch this movie in 2 years. It is lame awful action film it is not better than the original it never will be. It will never be better than RoboCop 2 never in my opinion!Samuel L. Jackson is in this movie and he is so god damn awful that I wish someone would plug his mouth and cut his tung. The people who like or love this movie we agree to diasgree to me it is a peace garbage holly crap movie!!!!
Watch the original stop remaking a classic movies nowdays Hollywood!!!! They want to make now RoboCop Returns in wich it will be worse than this awful remake and will ignore RoboCop 2 which it sucks! I am going to watch RoboCop 2 anytime than this awful movie. RoboCop 2 is my favorite sequel. RoboCrap 3 and RoboCock (2014) deserve been in the trash, I rest my case."
" Waste of time
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,2,"4 great actors is the only positive in this otherwise pointless film. All is lost. No classic scenes, no great story. Just an absolute wretched pile of parts. Like pulling all the paint of the Mona Lisa and repainting it. It's worse than that."
" Above Average: 6.0
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,6,"Unlike most people, I don't hold the 1987 original in very high regard. It's true that it had something to say, and was plenty well made, but any semblance of a message got lost in the over-the-top violence and self-indulgence. As to whether I prefer this newer, slicker, tamer version? I'd have to rewatch the original, but for now, I'd say that I do. The plot is pretty much the same: cop is almost killed in the line of duty, thinly-veiled clandestine corporation rebuilds him in the name of liberty and justice for all, etc. Really, there's not a whole lot more about the plot (or the rest of the film) without veering into spoiler territory, but there are one or two twists and turns that, while utterly predictable (even to those who have not seen the original), are acted and presented well enough. The action is sleek and spare, never reveling in the bloodshed the way its predecessor did, so points for that. But at the end of the day, it's really just another actioner that genre fans should see, but everyone else should merely consider."
" not that bad but far from the original
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,3,Like I said I think its a decent movie but to me to original is so good and fun to watch that this one is just very far from it.their is good action and decent special effect and the violence is really low so it can be watch by younger people then the original.

" The RoboCop of 2014 is merely a decent action flick
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,5,"I was a huge fan of the original RoboCop movies. Having been excited about a reboot I was disappointed to hear it wasn't all that great. And unfortunately, I tend to agree. It isn't however half as bad as people made out, but its not fantastic either. Its an extremely dumbed down version of events from the originals. It focuses more of Murphys ability to feel emotions and the cut off from his family. Unlike the original Detroit didn't feel under threat, nor was the action as dangerous or life threatening. There was less attention on the crime on the streets and his relationship with his partner (who has changed sex). RoboCop was a decent film however it became flat and uninteresting towards the end. Keaton and Jacksons roles were just lame, Oldman however was brilliant as ever. RoboCop has a fantastic storyline and creates a terrifying setting for unnerving enemies and untrustworthy machines however this didn't feel the same in the reboot. The RoboCop of 2014 is merely a decent action flick."
" They'll fix you. They always do.
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,5,"Much ado is made about the movie's 'PG-13' status and, indeed, it does impact the piece. However, it isn't just the original's violence - and, I suppose, accompanying sadism - that this remake misses out on. It's the charm, characters, world and tone. What was once a broadly satirical, grimy retro-future is now a blandly sleek, big-budget metropolis. Of course, 'RoboCop (2014)' tries to include some satire but it's all, pretty much exclusively, relegated to the over-done 'Novak Element' segments, which attempt to modernise the first's brief and advert-interrupted news segments. The most interesting - and, indeed, entertaining - ideas are found here, however, as the piece attempts to update its target by making Jackson's right-wing TV-personality hilariously biased and by focusing not on the corporate but on the political, with emphasis placed on legislation and the fact that RoboCop is a political ploy. Still, the tone in every scene outside of the studio is as straightforward as they come and is, honestly, quite dull. The bones of the thing are basically the same as Verhoeven's but the skin is much baggier; it hits the same beats but takes a lot longer to do it, muddying the water with unnecessary elements that are interesting but, ultimately, relatively unexplored. The action also feels weightless, is often difficult to see and generally just lacks impact. The feature just feels generic. I don't think it has anything to distinguish itself from other, similar fare - despite, of course, its name and brand recognition. Take that away and you have a serviceable sci-fi but not much more. It isn't awful but it isn't particularly good, either. It's rather forgettable, to be honest. Plus, and I know this goes without saying, remaking 'RoboCop (1987)' is about as necessary as saving Alex Murphy's fleshy right hand. 5/10"
" A suit made to fit, but not cut to suit the cloth
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,6,"An American action thriller. The story is set in Detroit in the near-future about a policeman who has been critically injured in the line of duty. He is given a second chance to live by a technology company called OmniCorp. They see their chance to build a part-man, part-robot police officer using advanced technological achievements in robotics, artificial intelligence and cybernetics.
As a remake, it retains the central ideas and themes of the original film while updating and rearranging the narrative.
It is an entertaining film, graphics-rich and the visual effects are very good. The film has good pacing too. Unfortunately, the story is something of a let down, lacking logic and coherence and foregoes the wit and subversiveness of the original film and in the end feels leaden. While it touches on intriguing questions about human nature and a near-future right wing political agenda, it can't make its mind up what themes to rest on to explore. It has touching moments with the character's predicament, his loss, and his family's torment, but doesn't show the internal conflict of the policeman. It makes a point about populist media and hi-tech law enforcement and moral questions about artificial intelligence and remote-control combat systems but decides to concentrate on action and shoot-em-ups."
" Dead or Alive
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,6,I have watched the original Robocop trilogy so many times and love the over the top violence and one liners they are classic 80s movies.This movie is a different take from the original instead of adult themes and violence it focuses more on the human side of Robocop and the political controversy of Man or machine being the future of law and army enforcement toning down the Violence with taser guns and no direct view of bullet contact just flashes from the barrels.This movie is not a bad remake just a more modern teen certificate movie with toned down violence and bad language for a more political driven storyline and a quick hour and a half action movie.The cast is decent and the modern effects look great but is just a little over the top at times with robocops suit.I would recommend this to people who just wanna watch a basic action movie that entertains if not completely memorable if you have seen and are a fan of the original movies then don't expect much from this reboot.
" Absolutely dreadful remake. Great cast wasted.
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,2,"This film was a total disaster. I wanted to like it.....loved the original, which in itself was a rip off of comic book character Judge Dredd.
How could they get it so wrong!?
Great cast.......given zero to work with. It's actually quite embarrassing to watch. It fails in every aspect.
Just watch the first version. Which was dark and gritty with lots of violence. This is a lazy remake made for kids......no violence or blood, unlikable characters and ludicrous design changes. (the hand!? Ha ha ha)
A waste of time, money and talented actors."

Peter Wellers acting as Dt Alex Murphy in the Robocop original and the sequel and trilogy was realistic, awesome, tennse and absolutely brilliant, but Joel Kinnamans acting as Dt Alex Murphy in the Robocop remake is absolutely crap, lame, weak and just so damn awful.

" Robocop 2014
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,8,Ending is not so good but concept of this movie is fabulous. I really like it
" RoboGarbage
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,1,"I'm watching ""Robocop"", witch is not Robocop for the second time. Just to see if it is really as bad as I recall it, watching it the first time.And I still don't like it.Despite better effects and a more robot-like Robocop, the original from 1987, directed by the Dutchman Paul Verhoeven, still prevails.Many reviewers here comment to not compare it with the original RoboCop movies. What kind of nonsense it that!? This is not a new and original story. It is a REMAKE!! Would you not compare the next Titanic movie or the next Batman, Superman movies with the previous versions?!Here is why.First of all Joel Kinnaman is no Peter Weller. In the original, despite only 15 minutes or so as a human, Weller created a very likable Alex Murphy. Kinnaman can't create a likable Murphy. He comes off too much like a tough guy and a smart-ass. Murphy's death in the real Robocop movie is to the date still a very hard scene to watch. And the evil sadistic Clarence Boddicker (brilliantly played by Kurtwood Smith) and his ditto gang are to this date still awesome bad-guys. And when Robocop remembers its an absolute delight to watch him kill every member of the gang one by one.In this ""Robocop"" movie Murphy is almost killed by a car-bomb and I still don't like him nor do I care what happens to him either. That is a clear sign that the movie isn't working at all.And of course because ""Robocop"" is PG13, there is no blood whenever someone dies, no Boddicker, no Dick Jones (awesome Ronny Cox) no Bob Morton (awesome Miguel Ferrer) or any other bad-guys, just a Vallon (whats-his-face), a Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton), and a Dennet Norton (Bob Morton get it?). Vallon (a woman-sounding name) has too little screen time to even be noticed.Lewis is now a black guy not a redhead woman (awesome Nancy Allen) and trough in their movie he doesn't do anything. That character, Lewis, has nothing to do in here at all and he isn't in a movie much at all. Chief Karen Dean is now a black women instead of Sergeant Warren Reed (awesome Robert DoQui) what really made me angry is that Chief is a corrupt cop in this movie and she set up Alex Murphy they ruined the characters!""Robocop"" has no drive or motivation to go on living as a machine. In the real Robocop movie he had revenge that pushed him forward. The CGI version of ED-209 that like OCP has a different name moves exactly like the much more menacing stop-motion-robot in the original. So what's the point? Much like the rest of the movie.They spend a lot of time letting ""Robocop"" go through the motions with his new robot-body and showing he he is made. So his suit is black now and not silver, why? His suit looks like a capeless Batman or the stylized suit of a black Power Ranger. He has a human hand left on himself, why? So he could use Michael Jackson's style in 2028? Not a titan like the original RoboCop had. His helmet has a red laser. No, he is not Cyclops. And running simulation programs where he fights other robots like in a videogame and drives like a Speedy Gonzales. He doesn't drive a car and he transports himself like a Transformer he is. Again probably the rating. Had it been rated R, he would have been send out on the streets right away killing bad-guys, because that's what the real Robocop does.And what's with all that crap with his wife and son? Who cares. Like he could ever have a life with them again after his transformation. In the real Robocop movie they wiped his memory and he barely remembered them and that worked really well. There was not a single scene with Murhy together with his wife and son. And yet we felt Robocop's pain (now that is good acting from Peter Weller) Seeing the new ""Robocop"" cry as he talks to his wife and his kid on a Skype like connection made me wanna puke.What is Samuel L. Jackson doing in here at all? Jesus, he is terrible. This futuristic world in this movie is terrible.And yes I am comparing this movie with the original, why shouldn't I? It is based on the original movie. The Brazilian director José Padilha has no clue how to direct a good action movie and in my opinion I don't see this movie been a good action film at all, not just because it is different that is just not the case, but because it is ""RoboCop (2014)"".And all the satire and humor of the real Robocop movie is gone here. Instead we have a movie that takes it self way too seriously and the action-scenes feels like they were shot and directed by a teenager. Anyway, this new RoboCop makes RoboCop 3 look like ""Citizen Kane"" in comparison.Avoid this crap. Even if you've never seen the real Robocop movie from 1987 and you were born later and it seems outdated, I guarantee that you will still prefer that to this crap. But if you like this 2014 version ""fantastic"" your opinion, because you don't know about Peter Weller or Paul Verhoeven or maybe you are family or friends of the Cast & Crew; but I hate it to death!I am rating it 1/10 I don't want to type anymore, and I say one thing to Jackie Earle Haley, please retire! You made a remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street which was a abomination and you remake this movie that was a disgrace! Retire!"
" Oh dear.

Slow, uninteresting and the gun noises are heard more than actual dialogue."
" An Okay Film but Not a Necessary Remake
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,5,"Having had great success with mechanical robots and drones being utilized to thwart terrorism and curb armed unrest in Iraq the corporation responsible for the manufacture of these machines known as OminiCorps now directs its attention to addressing the crime problem in the United States to increase their profits dramatically. The problem is that certain politicians feel genuinely concerned about replacing law enforcement officers with machines that lack the necessary compassion and understanding that goes with the job. It's then that a Detroit police officer named ""Alex Murphy"" (Joel Kinnaman) is horribly mangled by a bomb and what is left of his body is subsequently used by OmniCorps to create a cybernetic human as a prototype to essentially ease the concerns of those politicians. However, what the management of OmniCorps doesn't tell anybody is the fact that much of Alex Murphy's free will has been hijacked by the electronic devices imbedded in his brain to the extent that his actions are entirely similar to the machines that he was supposedly designed to replace. And try as they might, this is an element that the public relations within OmniCorps cannot contain for very long. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this remake of the earlier 1987 film had slightly better special effects and more depth than the original film. Unfortunately, neither of these improvements were that significant to actually justify a remake all things considered. That's not to say that this was a bad film by any means, but I believe that the original version was more impressive for its time and for that reason I have rated this particular film accordingly. Average."
" Really Not Bad...
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,6,"I'm a big fan of the '87 original and I still think this remake wasn't a bad effort, pretty cool actually. It doesn't stack up to the original, but when does anything? It's loaded with action, drama, and sleek attitude. It's entertaining, and doesn't disgrace the source material, and that's the most important thing."
" Good but not great
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,6,"This is not a bad movie. It's a good movie, but that's it.
If you've watched the original RoboCop movie and then watch this, then you'll see that the old one is the best.
But if you haven't watched the old one and only this one, then it's a good movie.
But this lacks the feeling the old one had."

",2019-01-09 00:00:00,3,... as Alex Murphy. Imagine the first film if Alex Murphy had been given the chance to live. Great emotional portrait. Very Joelistic...
" Part machine, part cop, all man...
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,4,"First of all, yes, I'm a big fan of the 1987's. Second, no, I didn't expect this 2014's remake to be just a visual upgrade to Verhoeven's original. After watching it, indeed, it is not. 2014's ""RoboCop"" shares only two things from 1987's film, the title and the theme music, which is played once in the film, in a very unrelated scene. Of course, it's impossible not to compare this remake with the original, but let's try.This film is about a police officer that is almost killed by other officers when he starts to get too close to unveiling a scheme to distribute confiscated weapons on the streets. What remains of his body (part of his head and his right hand) is taken to a war robot factory in China, where he is turned into a cyborg. Why? Because there is a law that forbids weaponised robots on the streets of the USA, so the robots' maker, OmniCorp., devises a plan of building a cyborg, circumventing the law.Unfortunately, the cyborg is slower than the robots, because the human brain is naturally slower, for it is always processing ideas like good and evil or right and wrong, while a robot is there to follow orders (no, these robots have no Asimovian Laws installed). To make the cyborg pass the tests, the makers mess with what is left of his brain, ""turning it off"" when in ""combat mode"". It works, and RoboCop is ready for the streets, but that has a really bad effect on his private life, as the robot inside the cyborg doesn't have emotions whatsoever, upsetting his wife and son.All that drama takes about 1h15min of the almost 2h film, leaving less than 45min to tie all loose ends.RoboCop discovers his chief is the bad officer distributing the weapons. He is shut down when he confronts his chief, for ""reasons""... After that, OmniCorp. tries to kill its creation, but the scientist that built the cyborg helps him out.RoboCop goes after the head of OmniCorp., who is holding his wife and son as hostages. The cyborg tries to arrest/kill him, but is unable, at first, because the robotic circuitry prevents him from harming anyone wearing a safety tag... Buuuuuut RoboCop is no regular robot, he has a soul, which is capable of overriding all logic and soulless technology and finally push the trigger enough to kill the evil human being wearing a safety tag... Random scenes of RoboCop and family reunited, RoboCop back in the Police Department, some propaganda and the end. Credits roll.The visual effects in the film are ""effective"", but not amazing (there are some jagging on the ED-209 movements near the end, what is weird, as they are not stop-motion, but CGI).The action scenes are mostly ""0k"", but all scenes with robots are simply unbelievable, and not in the good sense: it's absolutely impossible to believe that a robot could miss a single shot, much less several shots. Sure, RoboCop gets hit a lot of times, but he shouldn't be able to win against several combat robots hunting him at the same time. The fight scene against several ED-209 is absolutely ridiculous: huge combat robots, with advantageous view (due to their heights), are unable to destroy one single cyborg. He is hit several times, but the bullets don't pierce his armour! A single shot on the head or chest would have killed him, but he survives a continuous stream of hot metal!The whole plot about the confiscated weapons makes no sense, not only because it's very unlikely that no one would notice the disappearance of heavy weaponry from the Police deposit, but because OmniCorp. wouldn't steal weapons from a Police Department to sell away.Now, a brief comparison with the original ""RoboCop"". The 1987's film was about the privatisation of the Police Service, with RoboCop being just another product with that purpose. This 2014's film is about an evil man, in an evil corporation, which transforms a cop into a machine, screwing up with his life. So, while the original was a social criticism on public politics, the remake is just a drama mixed with a crime story.Is this film entertaining? If you can turn your brain off and watch it in ""dumb mode"", sure, why not? If you, like many people, require a brain to watch anything, than this film can cause you some brain damage."
" Mildly entertaining but a very poor remake overall
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,4,Mildly entertaining but has none of the humor of the original so in the end it doesn't really work as a movie that takes itself too seriously.
" RoboCop: Simply didn't need to be
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,3,"Robocop has to be up there among the movies that simply shouldn't have been remade, just why?Okay fine I'm a tad bias, I'm generally anti-remake/reboot and think the fad needs to stop. Cease telling the same stories, cease fouling all over the originals, make new movies with new ideas please!To make matters worse on this occasion I think the original Robocop (1987) is highly overrated and I never saw the appeal at all. Then there are the sequels and the television series but let's not go there.So a remake of a movie I already thought was highly mediocre?! Didn't stand much of a chance really and it failed about as hard as I expected.Curiously though it's a cutesy PG-13 almost Disney version of the original tale, I was shocked how and why they'd taken an r-rated classic and made it fun for the family! Who made that decision, and why did they think it would be a good idea?The film to its credit has a great cast, Oldman and Keaton together in a movie and it's bad! Who saw that coming?The film is mindless action, a generic story line, full of wasted actors and an oddly large amount of political satire thrown in for good measure. Samuel L Jackson is Alex Jones, just less crazy, paranoid and did I mention crazy?Robocop (2014) simply shouldn't exist. It's not the embarrassment that Ghostbusters (2016) was but it still didn't need to be.The Good:Solid castSome solid political commentaryThe Bad:PG-13, really?Lewis's sex changeSome aspects are so stupid it made my teeth rattlePoor soundtrack choicesNo prime directivesShouldn't existThings I Learnt From This Movie:People need to stop doing polls on political specific sites""We are gathered here today in the memory of original ideas"""

" Brilliant modern adaption of a classic sci fi
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,10,"After re-visiting this movie after some years I was struck by how brilliantly cast this version was. In particular I thought Samuel Jackson's role was his best played and cast since Pulp Fiction. Joel Kinnaman was perfect as the family orientated good cop in crisis. But casting for the scientists, the rogue corporate executives, the cops, the villains and the family was also perfect for me. An action highlight is probably the initial sequence of demonstration robots but there are also whirlwinds of bullets, explosions and perfect cgi throughout. The very succinct ending (which I thought very original and unexpected) was a welcome piece of great scripting. Brilliant robotics, both visually and technically, as well as an overall theme. The photographic angles and rich colour of the night scenes was also to be praised and complimented the motorbike scenes. The speed of the ocular overlay graphics was also finely tuned. Everything was fast paced yet essential. Overall this was perfect popcorn viewing. A wonderful blockbuster. I really wonder there was no sequel."
" Better Than The Original
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,8,"If you go back and watch the original and then watch this one, I'm not sure how you can say the first is better? Original was fun at the time, but cheesy and corny. Joel Kinneman was relatively unknown when this came out and I think that added to people with mixed feelings. The outfit is cool, the effects are better, and the supporting cast with Gary Oldman and Michael Keaton beat anything the original offered! People romanticize films like Robocop, but when you go back you'll see it's not that great! The two sequels are straight to dvd garbage! This movie deserves a SEQUEL! It made money and found a big audience on blu Ray! Give us a sequel! Fans of the film deserve that! Now with Kineman well known and the blu Ray audience that skipped it in theaters this is a sure fire box office success and as long as you bring back Kineman and Oldman this sequel is a no brained! With all the junk that comes out, here you have a movie that would easily carry the box office if promoted and well written! If you recast forget it! Like Robocop 3 (with Peter Weller smart to pass) 3 was done before it opened even if it was a better story, which would have been pretty darn easy to do! You made that pile of dung and now you're going to kill a winner?"

The film opens with the liberation of Iran using drones and robots and goes on to question, ""Why not domestic use?""I did have some simple plot issues. The robot aspect was made in China. Alex/Robocop is used in Detroit, but when he goes back to the shop, the shop is suddenly in Detroit.Alex's plea to ""kill me"" once he lost his limbs reminded me of ""Johnny Got His Gun"" but the film never returned to that theme.Samuel L. Jackson plays a TV newscaster who favors the Bots and has some bleeped out words. Is it as good as the original? Does it matter? The plot was not as interesting as Asylum's ""Android Cop"" but the overall production was better.Good mindless popcorn entertainment. Not weighed down with theme. No sex or nudity. IMDB claims one f-bomb which I missed."
" Don't compare, just watch
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,7,"I find this film to deserve more praise, and my wonder is what the negative reviews are based on. The reviews say the film is good, the story is good, the cast is good, the effects are good, the theme/tone/atmosphere is good (involving the political/technological/business satire of our reality) and more goods. And then comes the negative: compared to the original movie, it is not so good. Well, there are surely many good movies out there which can be straight sent down to the waste dump once they are compared to more praised films. But if you are a guy or gal who happens to have never seen the original RoboCop before this remake, like me, and watched the remake with an open and uninfluenced mind, then perhaps you can appreciate the remake positively, like I did. I admit, the movie does not reach the level of a cult classic, but we'll never get to know that for sure now because of the original. The Man in the Machine concept is in real focus in this remake and it gets a considerable amount of attention from its creators. Murphy is seen to be immobile, he is really controlled by a remote control and we are reminded of this fact repeatedly. We see how much left of a human he is, by seeing his lungs and head only, emphasizing the fact that he is really more machine than man and that the ""suit"" is really him. He is repeatedly taken back to the lab for maintenance, where the doctor is tweaking and calibrating Murphy like he really was a software or hardware, switching circuit chips and lowering/raising the dopamine levels in his brain, suppressing the free will of Murphy. To me as an engineer these details are fascinating and important to make me accept the idea in the movie as a serious concept. I also liked how the action scenes were was fast and clean, for instance when Murphy made quick and swift arrests, rather than flashy combat action scenes with long running time and predictable outcomes. In the movie, the action scenes try to how a machine would solve an emergency situation, e.g. when Murphy is moving and deflecting the dangers according to how the software optimally operates him to, with the use of Computer Vision. The scene with RoboCop VS the Robots was interesting thanks to the inter-cuts to where the Doctor explains how he circumvented the will of the human and enhanced the control and performance of the machine without disrupting the Human-Machine Interface. Action scenes are interesting when they are given a meaning. For people which enjoy an action flick with themes that have a slight serious yet creative and interesting tune to them, this is a movie for your night."
" PG13 cash-in remake.
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,4,"The original movie is a far superior film.
This was pg13 watered down trash in comparison. No real villain or care for the characters.This movie had great potential. A good cast and good budget, but the story sucks and is bland. Another oppurtunity missed. If you left a positive review for this film then you probably need to reevaluate what a quality film actually constitutes."
" Unexpectedly groundbreaking
",2018-09-20 00:00:00,10,"Wow. From a reboot of a cult 80's movie from an unknown director I certainly did not expect what was coming. This must be the most realistic sci-fi movie ever made, as well as the most realistic portrayal on corporate greed. The latter blew my mind: the script manages to have the corporate executives use language that lets them convince themselves that their reasoning is sound and just, even brilliant, while letting them arrive at decisions that are absolutely villainous. That is the problem with corporations, laid bare for the first time in history.
The casting of Beetlejuice as the CEO is genius, he applies the same kind of charm he manages in telling every lie. Gary Oldman as the scientist makes for the most human cast member, trying to reconcile conflicting orders with his own ethics and objectives."
" Took out the violence and replaced it with a dull social commentary
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,3,"Paul Verhoeven is one of the most misjudged movie directors I know of. I remember loving the hell out of his movies, while at the same time reading everywhere how the majority of critics hate them for being ultraviolent and with shallow theme exploration. Nobody seemed to understand the guy was making grim satires full of rule of cool. Said critics needed 3 decades before they realized their mistake, once other directors made remakes of his movies and they were awful. Complain all you like about the overexcessive violence and the over the top performances, but at the end of the day that's what was making them so great. The moment they try to take themselves seriously, is the moment they fail horribly. But that's the result of everyone trying to imitate the success of the Dark Knight without never getting what exactly was making that Batman movie so successful. Let me remind you in case you didn't get it either. It wasn't batman being serious and moody. It wasn't the movie taking itself seriously. It was the Joker trolling the crap out of everyone. His morbid sense of humor is what made the social commentary and the action scenes, so fun. But nope, everybody just assumed all you have to do is have joyless characters and a mundane setting that looks like ours, which deals with current social issues. We can't have fun while watching movies anymore. We need to be constantly bombarded with current sociopolitical messages even if the movies take place in the future, or in a galaxy far, far away. You hear that, you neo-liberal Star Wars? And the worst part is how this movie does its best to make that clear. When they are making the body of Robocop, initially it's white just like in the previous version. But then a guys says ""No, make it black, so people can take Robocop seriously"". Gah, Robocop is by inception not meant to be a serious story. It's about a guy becoming a robot and avenging his death. The social critique is just there to excuse why he went on a killing spree. It's there just to justify his motives. Murphy is the focal point, not the setting. They flipped that around in this version, because it worked in Batman, and it became boring. It could still be a fun action flick if at least the setting was fun to watch, like the over the top dystopia that was Detroit in the older version, but no, there is nothing memorable about it. All the bad guys behave in such a normal way, to the point you have nothing to remember them for. Being over the top cartoonishly evil is what was making them memorable. They even took out the violence which is what was making the action scenes so memorable. Now they look like videogame cut scenes where the option to show the blood has been turned off.There were a few things liked in it, such as Murphy being aware of turning into a cyborg right away and even willingly taking away his emotions, so he can perform better in his job. The psychological pressure he was going through shows ten times more. Another one is making it clear the robotic body he is using is just one of countless mass-produced bodies out there. This is taking away his uniqueness and lets you feel how unimportant he is next to all the sociopolitical schemes going on out there. Giving him a faceguard and beacons that clarify what counts as a target he cannot attack were also fixing small issues of the older version. But these are not making up for the overall dullness of the film. There is nothing of interest going on half of the time, the characters have no charisma, and the action scenes have no impact because of how safe they made them for a mainstream audience. Well that's what you get for making Robocop mainstream. Nobody liked it as much as when it was niche."
" Robo-Kindergarten Cop
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,3,"No, I'm sorry, but it's a complete misfire! I really tried to remain open-minded and set all my prejudices aside, but this is a hopelessly disappointing remake of one of the greatest Sci-Fi/Action flicks of all times! The original ""Robocop"" (Paul Verhoeven - 1987) was dystopian Sci-Fi trash with extremely OTT violence and sadistic humor. That formula worked brilliantly, so why on earth would anyone consider turning it into a dead-serious, melodramatic and politically correct mainstream flick with a PG13 rating?!? This modernized dud only makes me worship Verhoeven's original even more, and it especially makes me admire how simplistic, straightforward and fast-paced that classic was! José Padhila's ""Robocop"" is intolerably slow, boringly talkative and the actors almost seem to drown in all the supposedly intelligent and socially relevant sub plots (like ""why should our boys die in Afghanistan"" or ""is America ready to be protected by machines""). Who cares about all that? The only thing everybody wants to see is Robocop in action and neutralizing evil street thugs. Will that ever happen, though? Nope, sorry! It takes, what, 17 hours into the film before officer Alex Murphy, wearing his Robocop outfit, sets his first baby-steps into Detroit and picks up a gun (dull target practice games with that idiotic Jackie Earle Haley doesn't count). But there also doesn't seem to be much need for a Robocop, anyway! The 2028 Detroit of this script doesn't look the least bit menacing, pauperized or overtaken by crime. In the almighty original, Detroit became a filthy hellhole where it was impossible for normal families to live or even walk the streets during the daylight because of police strikes and deranged criminals with gigantic guns! Sure, corporate greed and corruption remain obstructions for proper law enforcement, but there aren't any real bad guys for Robo-Murphy to defeat. Clarence Boddicker and his psychotic gang of the original were pure evil, whereas here Murphy/Robocop only has a pathetic weapon dealer (Patrick Garrow) and a cuckoo robot-fetishist (Jackie Earle Haley) as main opponents. But the miserable PG-13 rating is what neutralizes this film the most. Gone is the extreme violence and perverse humor of Verhoeven's original. No more target practicing on poor cops, death by toxic waste, bloody massacres by a malfunctioning ED-209, insanely offensive TV-commercials or gratuitous nudity & drug abuse! All this got replaced by bloodless shootouts and tedious gibberish by an annoying marketing guy. Even the leftovers of Murphy's body after the explosion are laughable instead of unsettling. Robocop? Yeah right, more like Kindergarten Cop! However, exactly like the case with ""Robocop 3"" (Fred Dekker - 1993), I am aware and personally persuaded that director José Padhilo cannot be blamed for this insult of a film! Via many little details, it's abundantly clear that Padhilo is a big admirer or Verhoeven's original and that only the cowardly attitude of the production company led to this inferior version. Also, I can't resist mentioning the hypocrisy of the script. Americans are supposedly worried that emotionless machines will be carrying guns, while mass-shootings take place daily because every crazed nut can purchase a weapon? Please!"
" So so remake of original
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,6,"Meh. The original is so much better
But if you wanna watch fun action flick you can watch this remake. Nothing special. Dead or alive,you're not gonna think this is better than original."
" good morale undertone
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,9,"Loved the original and this is just as good, still relevant"
" Just like Samuel L.Jackson said in the end of the movie: Stop whining
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,8,I'm totally fine with movie remakes or reboots of a series if they got fresh idea to once famous character and know how to bring the character back to modern public eyes so when finally got the time to watch the 2014 remake of Robocop i want to pat everyone back who work on the movie for a job well done cause this movie is not a slap to the original material when it explore more about things the original only touch on the surface.Stuff like what happens inside Alex head when he turn into Robocop finally get a reasonable answer and the hardship of how he dealing with his family when the original show very few of it.That being said I find the world buildinng in the original still better when it actually show how much of a dark and gritty world we live in when in the 2014 version we only saw it though little computer screen.The action is okay at best and the replacement of Clarence a scary criminal that give Robocop alot of trouble Antoine Vallon is so forgettable and too much of a coward.In the end there things to like and dislike in this movie so don't dismiss it just because it a remake of a movie you like
" I can't help but feel like I'm missing something here.
",2018-05-26 00:00:00,4,"RoboCop doesn't even compare to the original 1987 classic, and the sad thing is that this film lacks the original's satirical edge and humor. It's a movie made in a 2010s Hollywood risk-free environment directed by Jose Padilla who had too much respect for Paul Verhoeven's original that he had to rephrase any and all criticism he had for THIS movie. RoboCop 2014 lacks RoboCop 1987's teeth; it almost feels like it has none at all.I love the updated look first of all: it truly is great how they sleeked everything up to speed with post-2012 technologies and such, though the characterization, the lack of over-the-top violence and thuggery is something the remake desperately needed in order to measure to RoboCop's original '80s brilliance. Sadly the remake fell short because Padilla couldn't experiment enough; he was a dog on the Hollywood-executive leash and couldn't bite back once. Joel Kinnamen does bring some depth to Alex Murphy's character, but the guy's like a bunny-rabbit compared to Peter Weller's hardened veteran-cop but caring family man look that made him such a paradoxically awesome character in the original.Overall, this is a nice visual redo that unfortunately lacks the substance of its source."
" Uneven
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,6,"While it was vastly superior to the 2nd (one of the worst movies I've ever seen) and marginally better than the 3rd, I was still disappointed with the remake because the action scenes were just OK and it had no main villain. The criminals didn't have much personality either. It was more the psychological side of RoboCop and those scenes worked best, but as an action movie, I was disappointed."
" Pretty Good Movie.
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,10,"What an awesome film I just saw, I'm not hardcore fan of the original Robocop, so I don't have any prejudice on this film. I heard it was awful and believe it and did not watch it until now 2018, I regret taking so long. It is amazing story, well executed, pretty solid movie, flawless. Even the black color has its purpose, he looks cooler, and he wore black while he was being manipulated by omnicorp, that represents the black, in the beginning and in the end he switched back to silver, the color he was meant to be how he meant to be, but Omnicorp prevent that from happening. The story of him as a father is magnificent. In the 80s people used to think the future will be more aggressive, well, guess what? We are in the future and the future is not agresive, so yeah he uses a teaser that's the world we actually live in, face it. Pretty awesome movie."
" A soulless remake
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,4,"I went into thins thinking I'm not sure we need this remake to begin with as the original 80's movie stands up fine and is still such a classic...and I was right New Robocop is just another soulless CGI fest with way too many shoot-um-up scenes, giant robots, video game style action and missing all the emotion and campiness of the original. Joel Kinnaman, I like him but he is lost here as Murphy -a cop resurrected as a crime fighting cyborg whose past life makes him question his corrupt corporate overlords, as he also seeks justice against the criminals that attacked him.Even during his horrifying physical transformation, which leaves him mostly cyborg, I didn't get the feels. I also didn't like how they changed the storyline and had him getting injured in an explosion and then his wife signing him over to Omnicorp In the original the scene that has always stayed with me is Peter Weller getting shot multiple times, getting his arm blown off and his heartache after he is ""robocoped"" that his wife thinks he's dead and he knows he can't go back to her, ever. This also has me bored with too many endless shoot um up scenes that just went on and on.Ultimately I was disappointed but no more than I expected. Even if I try to take this reboot on its own merits and forget about the original its just not a great movie."
" Meh is what you get when you make a RoboCop rated PG13
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,6,"The original RoboCop was first rated X and then re-rated R. And that's how it should be. This story is not for kids, it's for grown ups. But the powers that be in Hollywood decided to milk the tikets cow as much they could, so they made a PG13 RoboCop. And the end result is meh. The original had Kurtwood Smith, one of the most awsome villains in movie history. This one has three mini-badies you or RoboCop care nothing about. The original had a corrosive and pervasive critic to corporate America, to the greed and the total lack of morals of the 80's yuppies. This one, well, it's more worried about how Murphy copes with is situation as an amputee and the effect it has on his family - and that's a problem in a RoboCop movie where what you want is to see the hero go head to head with the guy who turned him into a machine by shooting him to a pulp, not hear him whine about not having a body to love his wife properly. The film tries not to upset anyone too much, and that's the problem.
All in all, it would have been better to make a good sequel to the original, maybe bringing back Peter Weller for one last take at the character, Now, I'd buy that for a dollar!"
" RoboCop is another remake which does not capture the original's charm.
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,6,"It's all too common now for every time to claim ""oh yeah, remakes are never as good as the originals"". Unfortunately, with additions like this, the argument is true. However, this is not as terrible as everyone may lead you to believe. In fact, I would say this was rather well crafted. Alex Murphy was just a cop doing his job, where a crime takes place involving him opening his car to a bomb detonation. Omnicorp, who desire a more human leading figure for their meticulously crafted robots, use Murphy's body (or what's left of it...) and put it into a robotic suit. Ladies and gentlemen, we now have ourselves...RoboCop. All those who have seen the original will say ""all the graphic content has been washed away in this remake!"". I've not seen the original, but from clips it was pretty hardcore and with focus on props rather than CGI. However, for what it's worth this is a fine film to introduce the eponymous character to a new generation. The visual effects used were well constructed and perfectly suited the environment, loved the constant use of Murphy's HUD so we can visualise what he sees. The production was clean, efficient and had a good clinical style. Gary Oldman was perfect as the conflicted pioneer in robotics. Michael Keaton was also decent for his role as the central antagonist. Joel Kinnaman takes a while to warm to, but by the end I thought his monotonous portrayal felt right. The characters themselves are underdeveloped due to the focus primarily being used on the ethical and moral implications of robotics and it's usage in national security. I would've liked a little more exploration in this topic as well. The main problem is how generic everything feels. The action, the characters, the plot...it's far too bland which prevents anything memorable from occurring. Sure it all looks good and is functional, yet all aspects were washed over. Jay Baruchel was odd casting as well. RoboCop is a serviceable remake, just can't quite settle on what it wants to be."
" I grew up with Robocop and I enjoyed the movie
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,8,"I am a huge fan of the first Robocop movie and this reboot did a decent job. The action is good, the Computer-generated imagery (CGI) is great. The relationship between detective Murphy and his family feels real and there is good acting involved between the wife, son and Robocop. Now that I am a dad, I can empathize with the situation of a family being torn apart. The man vs machine aspect is thought provoking if you think beyond the movie, especially with AI being a big topic lately. Morality, ethics and science and little we know about the human brain and soul comes into place in this action movie. Corporate greed (Omnicorp) is a perfect example of what we see today.I think this is a great action movie, good cast and I can't believe I missed this in 2014.I hope you enjoy it.Cheers,

" Nothing new, but a decent action film. I just wish Samuel L. Jackson wasn't beeped in the final scene!
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"I went into the 'RoboCop' reboot with fond, but not very vivid, memories of the original, seeing as it came out when I was 2! I do remember having a RoboCop figurine that I used to play with as a kid. And this new film does a good job of making him look both new and futuristic, but also similar enough to the original that old fans won't be disappointed - he's silver for about a third of the film and black for the rest.In terms of story, it's pretty straight forward - Detective Alex Murphy (Kinnaman) is almost killed, is turned into a cyborg and then tracks down the bad guys in Detroit. Sure, there's a little more to it than that - is he more man, or machine? Does he still have a conscience/soul? And does it matter if he's good at his job?There's some decent action, but a lot of shaky/fast camera work that doesn't always help the action scenes. It feels longer than it should and doesn't have the best ending. Oldman and Keaton are good, but it's hard to feel any real connection to Murphy and his wife (Cornish), as you never spend any real time with them."

Great idea yes?SUIT #2: You sir, are a genius."
" An excused remake, made to make a profit quickly... but nice and watchable
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,5,"""Robocop"" was one of the most remarkable trilogies of the eighties, and it marked the collective memory of those who lived that time. Even those who haven't seen the movies have surely heard of them. The story retains the essential structure that had been shown in the previous films, which makes me think about why they made this movie if they didn't show a new story. The answer is natural: profit. Anyway, there are some differences between this film and its predecessors. Most obviously, a major effort was made here to humanize what used to be a kind of unfeeling cyborg, that simply performed tasks for which it had been programmed. Another difference is that we watch the design and construction of the robot, as well as the motives and intentions behind it. It's clear the commercial interest, as well as the way the industry takes advantage of an injured man to conquer a new market. Another striking difference is the end of dystopian satire to urban society presented so far: the older films featured Robocop as a law response to a violent escalation of crime in an increasingly inhumane and savage urban world, while here he's only a mean to reach a new market by a large multinational.Joel Kinnaman played a decent Robocop, with some human traits but no emotion or obvious psychological conflict. Michael Keaton is a good villain, a self-seeking man who doesn't look to the means to achieve his financial goals. Gary Oldman is the most humane side of the industry who creates Robocop, and he manages to get out of the job even though there is no effort in betting on his inner or psychological conflicts. Abbie Cornish is the actress who has shown greater ability to demonstrate her psychology, but her character specifically serves this purpose. Samuel L. Jackson is a good actor, but I honestly didn't understand the purpose of his character. At a technical level, good CGI reigns in this film but that could be expected. Soundtrack, unfortunately, is quite forgettable.This movie, made for quick profit, is an unnecessary remake of a good trilogy of the 80's that isn't yet worn out by time. So its almost impossible not to make comparisons. Without much emotion or tension, the film lacks psychological depth and is utterly devoid of satire, though it weaves several harsh criticisms of how certain industries may be impersonal and inhumane. Curiously, one criticism the film doesn't do is that the robot is made in the new American mega-factory... China. We are well aware that companies (and not just US) like to exploit cheap labor of Eastern countries, but to see this on film is some bad taste."
" Stick with the Original
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,4,"Sometimes I wonder whether the directors of these remakes are sitting down watching the original film and thinking – gee, these special effects are really bad, I can do much better than that – and then proceed to remake the a film that ends up rubbing me up the wrong way. Okay, the world has changed since 1987, and film technology, as well as computer technology, has advanced significantly, but sometimes (actually most times) I feel that maybe the remakes should be left in the past and the creators attempt to use their juices (if they actually have any) to create something original (if that is at all possible).If you know the original film then you pretty much know the plot of this film. Sure, the names have been changed to protect the guilty (not really, but I suspect they wanted to attempt to distance themselves somewhat from the original, but not too far), and the plot is a little, not much, but a little, different. However, the basic premise is the same – Alex Murphy is killed in the line of duty so a multi-national corporation buys his body and turns him into a cyborg. The difference is that in the original film the fully automated robots weren't working, where as in this one they were, it was just that the American government weren't too keen on having them deployed on the streets, so they instead created this Robocop to help encourage the politicians to change their minds.The other really annoying thing was this talk/opinion piece that kept on popping up through the film – it was entirely unnecessary. Well, probably not, but like most opinion shows and shock jocks, I basically hate them because they talk as if their opinion is the only one that counts and anybody that holds an opposing opinion can be quiet. Sure, while I can simply turn off the television in the real world, this is a movie, and when this pain in the neck appeared on the screen it really isn't all that easy to change the channel. In fact, right through the piece, it seemed as if he was in league with the bad guys. The other thing was that the original just had some really cool ads, including a game show called 'I'll buy that for a dollar'.While there were some interesting aspects to this film, in the end, as far as I am concerned, it was a flop. Personally, I think I'll just revert back to the original, and the two sequels that followed on behind as opposed to this failed attempt at a reboot."
" RoboCock (2014) useless wasted pile of s**t remake!
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,1,"*MAJOR SPOILERS* Before you read my review there will be a lot of spoilers for this movie and they are really a lot of honestly from a fan of RoboCop like me. RoboCop (2014) is a peace of s**t wasted unnecessary reboot! RoboCop is rated Page-13 and it has nothing to see in here at all. This and Terminator Genisys are the worst reboot movies ever! This is the worst movie I have ever saw! It doesn't have a heart, soul, adrenaline it doesn't have any humanity left, I can't feel for this character here at all! This movie sucks ass it is time waster, boring, lame useless, dumb underwhelming, uneven, poorly-paced, and insincerely melodramatic peace of s**t! Stop remaking and rebooting the classics already! I hate this movie I hate, ""hate"" it! Joel Kinnaman is a STINKER cop in this movie and I will tell you why. So basically Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) get's blown away in car by bomb so he wakes up and suddenly he is a cyborg who supposed to be a Robocop. So his suit is black now not gray why? he has a human hand left on him self why? Not a titan like the original RoboCop had. His helmet has a red laser, Trough in tier movie STINKER cop doesn't do anything. Has an exercises and he runs from his problems like a whinny bitch he is. He has a wife who loves him the way he is and he doesn't lose his family like the original RoboCop did. I don't mourn for him and I don't feel sad for this brainless moron at all. So Alex on a parade shots a guy in front of a kid in front of his own son shots an unarmed criminal ""disgrace""! Lewis is now a black dude not a women and trough in tier movie he doesn't do anything. The character Lewis has nothing to do in here at all and he isn't in a movie much at all. He is missing he doesn't even support his partner at all! Murphy should have been called Robocop trough inter movie he wasn't called Robocop but Murphy. He wasn't part of machine or part of a human he wasn't. He was just a selfish dickhead in the movie who cared only for him self and his stupid ugly wife and his kid. Chief Karen Dean is now a black women instead of Sergeant Warren Reed (Robert DoQui) what really made me angry is that Chief is a corrupt cop in this movie and she set up Alex Murphy they ruined the characters! They ruined Murphy, Lewis and Warren Reed! Where are the bad guys? Where is some memorable bad guy in this movie? Where are some memorable lines in this movie at all? Robocock kills cyborgs like in a video game and drives like a Speedy Gonzales. He doesn't drive a car and he transports him self like a Transformer he is. Cyborgs ED-209 don't do much of a thing they are wasted and they don't do trough inter movie jack of sh**t. The music is terrible from Pedro Bromfman they don't use the original soundtrack from Basil Poledouris and song I Fought the Law is wasted peace of sh**t of a song!Gary Oldman as Dr. Dennett Norton sucks he is wasted, his character is terrible and he has no heart. Miguel Ferrer in the original RoboCop was better actor and better human being character than a wasted Gary Oldman is. I hate Alex Murphy's wife and his stupid son I wish he would lost them so we could morn for him but no! I wish he would be bad ass but Joel Kinnaman was a pussy in this movie he didn't do jack sh**t in here. Peter Weller the original RoboCop prevented two armed robberies, a rape which he shoot the rapist in the dick, he bust a drug factory on by him self, he stopped and punched a terrorist and saved the hostages in the mayor office, he stopped a violent gang by himself and he stopped a corrupt business man. This Robocop Joel Kinnaman didn't do anything trough whole movie. Michael Keaton I am sorry I love you in Batman and Batman Returns but in here I don't like you at all and I don't like your character because he is a terrible villain I have ever saw! You can not play a bad guy well believable enough in here at all. Where is the action in this movie the cast and the director promise us? There isn't any. I am very disappointed with this movie!The ORIGINAL is Miles way better movie than this STINKER is! The original has everything good characters, good script, good action, heart, soul, humanity, adrenaline, sadness it is Hard rated-R that's how you do a Robocop movie. Not a PG-13 movie like is RoboCrap 3 who got his ass kicked and this movie! What is Samuel L. Jackson doing in here at all? Jesus he is terrible. This futuristic world in this movie is terrible.And yes I am comparing this movie with the original, why shouldn't I? It is based on the original movie. José Padilha has no clue how to direct a good action movie and in my opinion I don't see this movie been a good action film at all, not just because it is different that is just not the case, but because it is RoboCock (2014).If you like this film ""fantastic"" your opinion but I hate it to death!I am rating it 1/10 I don't want to type anymore and Jackie Earle Haley please retire! You made a remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street which was a abomination and you remake this movie that was a disgrace retire!"
" Not the future of law enforcement
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,3,"Paul Verhoeven made a hyper violent satirical action film about corporate America in 1987.This remake has Samuel L Jackson's media host Pat Novak making right wing social commentary and an early sequence of Iran being liberated by US robo-soldiers but this part is then jettisoned.What we get is Alex Murphy massacred by a gang of criminals and rebooted as a half man half cyborg Robocop. Alex Murphy still has memories of his past life and wants to avenge his death. The boss of OmniCorp Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) sees Robocop as the future of law enforcement and wants to overturn legislation that outlaws cyborg cops. Robocop's designer Dr Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) is sceptical of the uses OmniCorp has for Robocop.The film lacks the kinetic energy, satirical bite and the cartoon violence of the original. The film drags too often, parts of it are dull. In fact when I re-watched this film several years after its release I forgot Samuel L Jackson and Michael Keaton were in this movie. That is how forgettable the movie is and Joel Kinnaman in the lead is just a blank."
" Robocop? More like a Power ranger on steroids!
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"Robocop 2014How can a remake or a reboot be justified? Well for me I think it need not be better than the original but it needs to bring something new to the table. That's how I think the Robocop reboot earns the right to its own existence. By no means is it better or even any where near as good as the original but it does bring a new take on the story. Where the 1987 version focused on satire the reboot tackles political issues relating to the world we live in today. So at least this movie has tried to move with the times. Where I think this film falls down is with its child friendly rating and lack of a convincing villain. The graphic violence of the original showed us the deconstruction of a man in the most brutal form. Necessary before we see his resurrection. For anyone not familiar with the tale Robocop is about a detective who is severely injured in the line of duty by a set of corrupt individuals. He is then brought back from the brink of death and resurrected as a super advanced crime fighting cyborg. In the 1987 movie the villains take turns at gunning a defenseless man down until he is left only as bloody scraps on a warehouse floor. This allows the audience to root for Murphy in his quest for revenge and to regain his humanity. Robocop 2014 doesn't give us this. Instead a car bomb is the method of which Detective Alex Murphy suffers his fate. Weak to say the least. Joel Kinnaman who portrays Robocop does a good job at conveying the pain of a broken man trapped inside a metallic shell. An interesting and moving scene is when he is slowly dismantled to show what actually is left of the man he once was. A head, a beating heart and two pulsating lungs. Kinnaman is actually more robotic in human form as he is as the machine. This differs from the Robocop played by Peter Weller as he is a machine slowly becoming a man once more. Proving that the soul never dies. There are some good supporting roles. Abby Cornish as Murphy's wife does a fine job as does Gary Oldmen as the scientist who bolts Murphy back together. There are interesting turns from Samuel L Jackson and Michael Keaton but sadly as I mentioned before no credible villain. This allows the action to fall flat. In a modern world where the cinema audience Is fed a diet of Iron Man and Avengers nothing here is memorable. Even the newly designed Robo suit looks like a Power-rangers costume only with better production value. There's no heavy duty metal clunk to Murphys Armour. Instead he looks like he's wearing a cladded wet-suit. Even the cars that are supposed to be futuristic just look like normal cars with plastic trims stuck over the wheel arches. Redesigned ED209 enforcement droids do look the business though as do the futuristic mobile phones and other tech. Robocop 2014 is a mixed bag. A reboot that at least tries to do something new with old material. A shame then that it falls short but it could be built upon with a sequel."
" Weak copy of a classic movie
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,1,"I watched Paul Verhoeven's film as soon as it was released and I was impressed by the violence but also by the script's intelligence. I confess that I was anxious to watch the new version of Verhoeven's film, even because director José Padilha is my compatriot (Brazilian). However, I was disappointed by the weak script, the superficiality of the characters and the drastic changes of the original film. You may accuse me of being old fashioned, but overcoming a classic lately has been an impossible mission. Another example is the classic Total Recall, also by Verhoeven."
" The future nobody wants
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,6,"For the older generation, the generation wherein I belong, we will prefer Paul Verhoeven's Robocop. At that time his movie was innovating and fresh. This version isn't bad though and for the generation that never saw the original one they will probably rate it a bit higher than I do. I'm just not a big fan of remakes unless they're done way better. And that's rarely the case. Joel Kinnaman as Robocop is okay though. The movie has the right amount of action and drama to keep you entertained. It's a good sci-fi story. A story that you hope will never come through because the last thing we need is robots taking over the already decreasing job market. And robots deciding what's right or wrong isn't a future I want to live in. So this Robocop is okay to watch once but if I had to chose I would watch the original instead."
" A Decent Movie in its Own Right
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Now I understand that a lot of people feel upset about how this remake departed from the original. After all, the original Robocop was a masterpiece. The dark comedy, the violence, the 1980's.... no remake could ever recreate that. After all, we're not living in the 1980's anymore.But thanks to other people's scathing reviews, I approached this movie with low expectations and I was actually very pleasantly surprised. While the dark comedy aspect of Robocop is very much toned down in the remake, and yes the weepy family moments are a little overdone (and that's why I don't give it 10 stars), I think this movie still maintains a lot of good qualities.Example: in the original Robocop, the battle scenes were actually very disappointing. They involved Robocop lumbering slowly through a warehouse, full of guys just standing there unloading their AK's at him to no avail. He shot them down one by one, and nobody ever grew a brain and realized their rifles were no use. But in the remake, I think the gunfights were a lot more realistic. The new Robocop is fast and agile, and also vulnerable to gunfire. He doesn't just stand there stupidly and let bullets bounce off of him, he ducks and weaves and takes cover, gets hit occasionally and actually gets hurt from it. So in that sense I'd say the remake improved on the original.Also, the evil Omnicorp is as evil as ever, albeit in a flashy 21st century kind of way. The sinister 1980's businessmen in suits have been replaced with soulless, clever Steve Jobs types, which I found to be a pleasing illustration of how the corporate scumbag class has evolved over the past 30+ years.There's also the deep-rooted corruption within the police force and within Corporate America that lies at the root of all evil, and Robocop wants more than anything to root it out. But his programming does not allow him to do so. That, I believe, is the central message of the original Robocop that has been preserved in the remake. I think the movie would have been an absolute fail if they tried to erase that central message.So all in all, this remake has been adapted for the 21st century audience, for better or for worse. I think they did a really good job, all things considered. My only real complaint is that the dark comedy was removed, presumably to reach a wider audience. Because of that flaw, I give it 7/10 stars."
