" IRA vs South Afrian vs Local Gangsters in a shootout. Great action
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,9,Funny little black comedy. Good characters too. Dialogue is fresh. Tongue in cheek to a degree. Keeps rolling along nicely. I dont understand all the 1* star ratings at all. If you like action flicks with loud guns and blood. You'll love this. 9 stars not 10 because of last minute of film.
" Fun, but forgettable
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,6,"Wait, hold on. What's that movie called again? Something about an arms deal gone bad, a big shoot-out? Oh, search results suggest 'Free fire.' Let me see... Yeah, that's the one! It was pretty good!Snappy, snippy dialogue moves fast amidst fairly constant action. You wouldn't think dialogue would be terribly important in a movie about a big shoot-out in a warehouse, but half the fun of 'Free fire' is all the double-crossing that goes on. Pay attention, though, because the film moves quickly enough that you'll miss out on that fun if you're not zeroed in on the screen.'Free fire' almost feels like a movie that Guy Ritchie might have made, a la 'Lock, stock, and 2 smoking barrels' or 'Snatch.' I say ""almost,"" though, because while the cast plays their roles well, none of the characters in and of themselves are as interesting as the ones we meet in in the latter films, or in any similar films. Likewise, for as much as the dialogue contributes to the overall fun of this picture, it falls short of what we get in other films. Is any such immediate comparison fair? Perhaps not, yet Ritchie leaps to mind as soon as you start watching.Maybe it has something to do with readily recalling similar movies we've watched, but as enjoyable as 'Free fire' is, its constituent parts never seem to entirely capture our imagination. As a result, it's just not especially memorable. It wasn't too terribly long ago that I watched this, yet I needed a search engine to even remind myself of the title, or the star whose name I recognized most (it's Brie Larson).'Free fire' is fun, and worth watching if you come across it. But this isn't the only movie about the criminal underworld and a big shoot-out, and you're apt to recall others more completely and more fondly.One thumb-up and a big shrug."
" Disappointing
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,4,"In the beginning I think that the movie is going to an gangster's sort of thing, but, while the movie is advancing it gets worst and worst, the cast is good, the acting is good, and the rest of the other technical parts are good, but when I was in the middle of the film I just want it to end. The comedy works, but the movie still don't convince me."
" Free Fire is not a bad chamber action movie
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,6,"Free Fire is not a bad chamber action movie. Everything is done at the middle level, starting from the cast, ending with camera work. And it seems that you will forget the film in a couple of days, so simple and trivial, but it is brought in the trailer as a magnificent Hollywood action movie from Scorsese. Well, it's ridiculous)"
" Brutally Hilarious
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,"This was such a funny film, I really didn't stop laughing for big portions of it. It was also SO brutal, I obviously knew it was a shooty shooty action film, but god some bits really took me by surprise; and that was SO enjoyable! This film actually managed to really surprise me in ways I never would have expected going into it. Only thing I will say is that it's quite slow paced, some parts especially at the mid-point feel like a drag, maybe about 20 minutes at the midpoint, but that didn't really take much away from the quality of it. Some of the camera work is also great by the way, the 70s era setting just makes it even better and the soundtrack is an absolute gift. Highly recommend."
" it's a comedy but it's not funny at all
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,4,"Free Fire is not really a good film. It has a fine concept, a whole gun fight that can be fully experienced in one film, but it's not executed well. The screenplay isn't all that good. It doesn't flush out any of the characters, they're just devices for the action. The film is a comedy, but not a single joke landed for me. I didn't laugh once. It's not funny at all. The film is super absurd at times and it's not engaging. It's just a boring mess of a film. I rate Free Fire a 4/10."
" I didn't stop laughing.
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,8,"I really started thinking about watching just one more action movie, and in a way yes, but I didn't expect such bizarre and hilarious situations.
It was an hour and a half very entertaining, with an easy story to follow. It has scenes that I appreciate great, like both sides trying to get to the phone, I can't believe it was incredible."
" Lots of Boom Boom
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,5,"A deal between a couple of IRA guys and some gun dealers goes awry and they end in shooting at each other in an abandoned factory building - that's more or less the plot. If you like Brit humor and some good ol' shooting, you may dare a look. I liked it, and in my opinion Free Fire is good enough to kill some spare time."
" A crazy and brilliant film
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,8,"Free Fire really wasn't what I was expecting. Described as a gun deal gone wrong, I was expecting this to be more of an espionage style thriller with twists and turns, but it is essentially just a protracted gun fight... and I absolutely loved it. It felt very unique and fresh, and took its time over an event that a lot of films would only dedicate 5-10 minutes to.As a result, I can see why some people might call this film slow or drawn out. Free Fire is essentially one long action scene, but I loved that the fact that they developed the characters and story through the action and did so in inventive and brilliant ways. This also gave this film a great unpredictability. As we were always in the midst of an action scene, we never knew when things were about to kick off again which gave the Free Fire a strong vein of tension throughout. This style may not appeal to everyone but it hit the spot for me.The opening was also fantastic. Considering the synopsis, I knew things were about to kick off, and the way that they injected tension and suspense in the opening act was fantastic. I was on the edge of my seat wondering how things were about to deteriorate.You also can't go too far wrong with such a stacked cast. Cillian Murphy, Sharlto Copley, Brie Larson, Armie Hammer, all fantastic and each brining something unique and vibrant to their roles. There was a good mix of drama and black comedy which every member of the cast rose to.A fresh take on the genre and a real treat!"
" Deadly funny - literally
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,6,"This film does not get high marks for anything: whether that is script, acting or direction. But it is a guilty pleasure movie that highlights the riduculousness to which men - and woman - can get to. The shootout is long-winded but hilarious. Will anyone survive or get away?
An enjoyable romp...."
" Mad, darkly humored, violent hour+ shootout
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,7,"Well the headline says it all. Free Frre is indeed a mad, darkly humored, violent hour-and-ten-minute shootout. The first 15 minutes does an excellent job of setting up the characters. We learn exactly what we need to know about them going into the rest of the movie and no more. We know that many of them have passed acquaintanceships, we know that no one trusts anyone, and we know that probably none of them are any good. Throughout the course of the flick we learn that this is one of those movies where reloading weapons is an afterthought, as everyone seems to have guns with 3000 bullet capacity chambers, or maybe they all just have 200 mags or endless bullet belts strapped around their waists.This must have been a very challenging movie to edit, more so than it needed to be because It suffers from a lack of establishing shots - it becomes fairly difficult to keep track of where everyone is at times - and I think the very, very ending, while okay is surprisingly conservative given the rest of the movie.Nonetheless, it's insane, over the top, violent fun. If you like the John Wick movies and can handle 90 minutes without Keanu Reeves then you might have fun with this flick."
" 3.0 out of 5 stars I had hoped for a blast of mindless fun...but it was actually a slog to get through.
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,6,"In many ways, this was really a two-star movie for me. I was watching it at home around 8:00 pm (prime viewing time) and I actually drifted off to sleep briefly once or twice. And this is a movie that is essentially one long action film. At least, that's how it is described. A shoot-out that goes on the duration of the film.That sounded very cool to me. Set in the '70s, so nothing high tech to be seen. Just handguns, shotguns and rifles. In a warehouse full of junk to hide behind. Lots of shooting. Lots of cool actors having fun. Great opportunity for some action choreography. Lots of tongue in cheek. Sign me up!Well, I now know that over an hour of a bunch of morons shooting at each other isn't really all that interesting. Yes, there were moments of humor. Yes, there were certainly a few pretty cool action moments. But there was lots of guns going off with no idea who was aiming at who. Lots of unintelligible yelling (take thick accents that are already challenging enough, and then YELL them in an echo filled room with gunshots going off all around...and you've got a recipe for not knowing what a character is saying). It all really ended up being quite tedious when it was all said and done. Moments that were supposed to be ironic were just ""ho-hum, who cares."" Whirling, carefully thought-out camera work was ultimately not helpful in giving the viewer a sense of who was where in relationship to everyone else. Stock characters doing noisy but predictable things actually did not result in more than the sum of its parts...which is what the filmmakers were going for, I think. AND what I had hoped for as a viewer.I give this film 3 stars instead of 2 because it was a noble failure. And it had a cool cast. I enjoy Brie Larson in everything, and this was really a different role for her. After GREAT performances in little films like SHORT TERM 12 and ROOM, I'm sure this was a blast for her. Sharlto Copley is always a welcome dose of crazy. Cillian Murphy is a cool actor, and Armie Hammer gets to have some fun. But in the end, the actors probably had more fun filming this than I had viewing it.I sure was disappointed."
" Business goes wrong, who survives?
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,5,"A clandestine business goes wrong, general shooting, who survives? That's basically it, you don't learn anything but it's fun.
I recommend it only to those who like crime movies and with a high bodycount (dead count) and ... and ...
and nothing else."
" Underwhelming, not terrible
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,6,"I was definitely expecting more from this film. It wasn't terrible, just incredibly average and it got pretty boring at times. Only reason I'm giving it a 6 over a 5 is because of the cast."
" ""It's too late, I'm already offended""
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,9,"Sharito Copley made this movie hilarious. His dialogue throughout was awesome. Other than that this movie was pretty great, solid and simple plot. Just don't think about what's going on too much and it's very enjoyable. Definitely Worth a watch!"
" An absolute blast
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,7,"This was a real hoot.The characters wanting to play 'big time' fell well short of their own expectations and aspirations.
A great deal of hapless, witless stuff goes on to great comic effect.I love hilarious, rediculous stuff and easy going action.I smiled and laughed all the way through."
" Whole movie is just pot shots
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,3,This was painful to watch.....longest and slowest gun fight...if you can call it that...in movie history AND ITS THE WHOLE DAMN MOVIE....waste of time seriously
" A crawling mess of the plot of resevoir dogs
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,5,Basically everyone shoots everyone crawls around for a prolonged time and you get none of the characters back stories and you never figure out why it exactly happened
" Boring, So boring
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,70% of the movie has bunch of people trying to killing themselves in a old factory. That's it.
" It's a black comedy.
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,8,"I love this film. It's full of macho dickheads, double crossers and horrible characters.
Not only that but what I imagine actually happens when people actually start shooting at each other; loads of misses, painful hits and lots of pain.
Also any movie with Creedence in the soundtrack works for me."
" Dublin Doubloons!
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,6,"FREE FIRE starts boldly with its gang war story and selects its audience at the outset. A lengthy opening scene introduces all characters and sets the somber mood for the rest of the film. Physical appearance is emphasized and so is style. While dealing with the impressionable, I think it tries to catch their longing for backgrounds.The existing enmity gets provoked through a deep and intense negotiation between the criminal gangs as it settles into a famous but dragging gunfight, further revealing the true natures of each of the members.The movie needs a lot of patience even for its mix to reach the expected end. There are weaknesses where the director could've easily worked on and I don't know why he's held back. Dialogues are poor and so is the screenplay. Latin American film influences are improper even if accidental.A Martin Scorsese executive production, Free Fire does not excite or disappoint. The ensemble cast tries hard and does a routine that can only get better with more experience."
" Bringing AR-70s to an M-16 Deal is not Good for Business!
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,7,"Free Fire is a clever, entertaining movie, pretty much about a gun fight. It's set in Boston in 1978 and director/co-writer/co-editor Ben Wheatley styles the production with a gritty, grind house 70's feel. He also primarily sites the film in one location; a cavernous warehouse with industrial overtones to it. If the setup and location is minimal, so are the backstories of the characters involved.Two groups meet to conduct an arms deal, brokered by a couple of intermediates, one for each side. The deal goes south, when a member from each team recognises one another from an earlier clash the previous night and continue their antagonistic behaviour, resulting in shots being fired. As participants dive for cover and reach for their weapons, the rest of the movie is about what happens afterwards.If Free Fire sounds like the action equivalent of a one joke movie, let me reassure you it's not. The screenplay finds ways to keep things varied and moving when it seems the story is destined to stagnate. The offbeat dialogue enlivens the proceedings as members of the two sides fire insults and quips at each other more frequently than bullets. It's really quite funny. On top of this a couple of unexpected intruders involve themselves in proceedings to add a dash of mystery to the storyline and there is a slight twist in the last couple of scenes that many alert viewers will probably be expecting.Wheatley and co-writing wife, Amy Jump, adroitly play no favourites with their characters. There are no ""good guys"" with whom to sympathise and ""bad guys"" to hate. Surprisingly in Free Fire this works, where in many other movies where heroes and villains aren't defined, it fails. This is due to the quality of the screenplay and the engagement and enthusiasm of the cast who are all very good. Stand-outs for me however are Sharlto Copley, who one feels was born to deliver a somewhat bumbling, psycho gun-runner (he brings a whole cache of the wrong weapons) like Vernon. Armie Hammer has some of the best droll lines as broker Ord and Cillian Murphy gets to use his Irish accent for once, playing an IRA team leader, with an eye to close the deal, but also for Brie Larson's resourceful Justine.Free Fire is a smart, suspenseful movie of sustained pace that never gets over tense due to its gallows humour and zingy dialogue. Its economical 90 minute length ensures that the narrative (what there is of it) doesn't get dragged out to excessive length. I don't agree with those that draw direct comparisons with Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, though I can understand why they make them. But this is one movie that is more than capable of and deserves to stand on its own considerable merits."
" Worthless
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,2,"(Flash Review)Ahhhh shucks...a simple illegal arms deal goes awry. A bunch of numskulls can't seem to manage a deal without their stupid egos complicating the situation. I must say the movie title is 100% accurate but this movie tried to be Tarantino without the story or dramatic flare. The only question to answer is who will survive the botched gun deal? Either the movie thinks it's cooler than it is or may be trying to pull off a parody....? This is full of gunfire, pointless cursing and hot headed idiots. ZERO PLOT. Why was Brie Larson in this!?!?"
" Useless story.
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,1,"Terrible story, extreme boring, the whole movie is in one hall site and besides this the worst part is there was nothing in the story."
" Entertaining enough but slow burn
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,6,Just a bunch of chatting well shooting guns and not much else. It's okay and entertaining enough but I don't see a lot of people enjoying it.
" Idiotic firefighting between gangsters
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,4,They could have at least made the explosion scene believable. They didn't even try. Just ruined the scene. Just stale lines read from a script throughout the whole movie. If you found this to be a good movie then you obviously have no idea what a good movie is and you purposely avoid looking for a good movie. Hardly anything exciting in this movie.
" Shooting
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,1,"Just a war deal but shooting happened
Only shooting nothing else"
" Screenplay could have been better
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,6,I loved the action and humour mix they tried to built in the movie but there is no proper story or screenplay to the character. It is an average movie with some decent acting from casts. The camera work was also good
" interesting concept
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,7,"What if during a shootout between 2 gangs, people don't instantly drop dead when shot but suffer on? What if the standoff isn't swiftly over like some western duel? Some dialogue could've been written better but there a few good laughs with great actors. In short, an interesting movie experience. Definitely +7 on a IMDB movie rating scale."
" Fairly dull, uninspired action
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,5,"Someone else nailed it when they called this ""Free Crawling."" A similar joke occurred to me about halfway through the film. It's a shame because I like Ben Wheatley and so many of the cast members, but the writing here is just fairly poor. The only suspense is really wondering who is actually going to live through the whole thing, but that's not enough to sustain interest. The action is mostly barely comprehensible and things quickly devolve into people randomly shooting at each other as they crawl around in the dirt. I think the amount of time any of the characters are actually standing up accounts for less than 5% of the movie's run time. All this might be ultimately forgivable if there were some sort of payoff at the end but there really isn't."
" Overlooked little gem that deserves another shot
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,8,"This is the kind of movie that came with a good buzz, but then entered and left cinemas in limited release and with little fanfare. So I half expected this to be released quickly via streaming or cable TV, but it still took me 4 years to catch it. Fortunately, some VOD sites have temporarily offered their content for free to offer amusement to those who are bored. And this movie is anything but boring.Some directors don't need a lot of plot for a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and Ben Wheatley of Kill List fame is one of them. In fact, there is a theory that states that movies get more fun when you can summarize the premise in fewer words. ""Weapons deal goes wrong and bullets fly back and forth"": a promising start, and Free Fire hits its mark for most of its 91 minutes.To be clear, this is not the most original movie ever; the first act is an obvious Tarantino-esque exercise in creating a verbal suspense bomb that may blow up at any time. Two groups of criminals meet up for the aforementioned weapons deal at an abandoned factory, and except for Justine (Bree Larson) who arranged the meeting, the two groups hardly know one another. That is, except for two people from opposite groups who have unfinished business together. This is great fuel for a powder keg of insincere pleasantries, awkward exchanges and tense conversations, where it is just a matter of time until tempers flare and the situation ignites.Before we know it, both teams go at each other with everything that fires, with lots of bullets, injuries (both expected and unexpected), whacky situations and creative insults in both directions as a result. There are some unexpected turns here and there, as well as some dubious characters, but that is pretty much the setup for the rest of the movie. More isn't necessary: both groups profoundly mistrust each other, so they need to look for cover and use everything within reach (or at crawl-length away) that can give them the upper hand, or try to quell the situation.With so much trigger-happy mayhem going around, you need a good group of actors, solid directing and skillful editing to tell everyone apart, and make sense of who is shooting who. Fortunately, Wheatley takes ample time to introduce his characters with their colorful 70's clothing and demeanors in the beginning, so that we have some recognition of who they are and on which side they are shooting. It still takes plenty of effort to stay focused and get a grip on some fast-paced situations, but luckily, the characters themselves also make a couple of mistakes there. The excellent cast helps, with a special mention for 'Luther's Michael Smiley as a grumpy gangster, Armie Hammer as his wisecracking counterpart, and Sam Riley as a big-mouthed junkie. However, Sharlto Copley, with his well-known manic energy, seems to have the most fun with the black humor of the situation, and goes over the top in the best way possible.There are a few moments where the hour-long stand-off takes its toll on the movie. The pacing sometimes slows down a bit, some scenes get a bit grim or dragged out too long, and some situations are confusing due to the many characters, but that is largely compensated for by a couple of great jokes and dialogues, a few WTF moments and some memorable character exits. If you've missed this and wonder what you'd get if Reservoir Dogs was spliced with a 70's Eurocrime movie, give this one a chance."
" Unevenly paced, messily edited, sometimes confusing and not very well structured,
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,7,"Free Fire is also, on many occasions, truly laugh out loud funny, I mean some of the line readings and stings of dialogue are really funny. The film is extremely well shot, the cinematography is lovely and the set design carefully messy.It's a creative and unique affair seeming to all take place at floor level. It's not particularly deep or meaningful or clever. But it is simple and it is fun. Which is already two over most other blockbusters. And it clearly shows Sharlto Copley as the memorable offbeat leading man he has the potential to be when given the right material."
" Interesting movie w/ lots of shooting
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,6,Interesting movie what takes place in one location. Lots of bullets flying every way.
" Might suit fans of violent westerns
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,7,"A black comedy about IRA guys trying to buy crates of machine guns in Boston USA. Michael Smiley and Cillian Murphy are buying from Sharlto Copley and Arnie Hammer when a row breaks out in a warehouse between two henchmen from the opposite sides over a female relative who was assaulted. It explodes when one of the seller's team shoots an IRA guy and carnage ensues for the rest of the movie. Where it could have been boring, it reminded me of some violent westerns, maybe a bit like in The Wild Bunch and kept me entertained throughout. As a huge fan of Cillian Murphy from TV's brilliant Peaky Blinders I was hooked from the start, particularly with the addition of the lovely Brie Larson. They all sustain relentlessly unlikely wounds that would render real people to be incapacitated but they carry on regardless. In fact at times it's like Carry On Regardless. Viewers here seem to either love it or hate it but I loved it."
" Scorsese? Cosi cosi, maybe.
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,3,"For a Scorsese film, it's lacking any story elements or anything that makes it worth watching as more than ""background noise."" I saw better movie elements in the loading scenes for Halo back on the Xbox. The dialogue would be better if there was none. This was a disappointment. Points given for silly gunplay, but honestly the best part of this movie was watching Brie Larson (who plays exactly the kind of role you'd expect her twitter feed to suggest since she got woke) getting shot."

" Spree Styler
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,8,"Ultra profane, ultra violent and ultra hilarious, this spree-for-all shootout is stylized for maximum fluidity and fun, and doesn't let you take it too seriously even as gritty as it gets. The acting is just right, comensurate with the unique mix of genres. Takes its time to get into its groove, and literally drags out just shy of too long. Solid action comedy entertainment."

" Biggest disappointment of the year
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,3,"Before I start, Brie Larson cannot act. Whew, had to get that out. She's just awful. When she starts to speak, it stops whatever energy the scene is carrying, just dies. This movie starts out strong with a good setup and outstanding sound track. It has a boatload of stars and was very anticipated film. Unfortunately, the action starts and it goes oft the rails. Tries to be SMOKING GUNS or PULP FICTION but ends up just losing the audience in the second act. wouldn't recommend"
" Not bad but feels like Mrs Marvel is OP again
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,5,"Its not a bad movie. Mostly entertaining & funny at times. The ending just feels forced so the woman wins & shows how strong, uncompromising, ruthless & emotionally detached she can be by killing the last two men by sniping & especially one that she had a bit of an attraction to. Now this isn't just a woman winning is bad thing but if a guy & in particular the guy she clicked with was in her shoes i dont think he would of killed her. Point is seems like Cillian Murphys character should of lived too. But we're now in a moment where Hollywood is full in on 'woke' movies & the womans gotta be exactly like a man in every respect. They are in most cases, there are differences; physical attributes is one but mentally a brain is a brain & woman can do anything a man can. When i started the movie i said the woman would live & she even says, ""IIFM"" (In It For Myself) but the ending sucks mostly how it plays out not just the fact she kills them its how she snipes them in a completely weasely, weak,  cowardly way that takes away from a woman's strength & equality. If she had said something that would of warned the men. Something that would of put them on equal terms & she won excellent but this ending was cheap & i think it was trying to imply she can be as mean as any man."
" Makes The Town look like high Shakespeare
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,2,So derivative I only got a through a third of it. Hopeless from the start. I'm not a huge action fan so no great loss.
" Pointless Movie With Fake Inflated IMDB Score.
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,1,This is total waste of time and talent. There is no logic to the plot because there is no plot. It's just people shooting at each other for no reason for a solid 1 1/2 hours. There is no character development and no story arc. It's really terrible and a waste of a talented cast. This has to be an inflated IMDB score because nobody who suffered through this could possibly give this thing anything higher than a 3. I gigged it 2 points to make up for shills pumping up it's rating.
" Cool idea, but not a lot more.
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,6,"Now, I know a lot of people really don't like this movie, and for good reasons. But I kind of enjoyed it. Most of the acting was good, the jokes were alright, and the idea of one big shootout for a movie was pretty interesting and I kind of wanted it to work.But the reality is, having a movie just be a shootout doesn't for the most substance filled and interesting movie. And you can tell that it doesn't work in a lot of ways. Mainly, the movie kind of gets drawled out padded with what feels like the same scene happening over and over again. Hence, the middle chunk of this movie is kind of boring. Basically, the movie's shootout starts and it's pretty interesting, some characters switch sides and you think some of the characters could die, but then all the characters get shot like once in like the knee or something so they're injured but not dead, and then the rest of the middle chunk of the movie is just people shooting and crawling with no underlying substance or change in plot. The movie also does this thing where like a character will pass out from an injury or blood loss, and some of them come back later and some just die, so you're kind of confused like is eh dead or not and theirs no clues to help you figure that out either.Overall, it wasn't an awful movie, and it had it's moments, but it just was missing something that movies of it's genre like reservoir dogs had that ended up leaving the film kind of empty."
" Inspirited by an actual F.B.I report on a Miami shootout
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,6,"Enjoyed this so much when i watched it at the cinema that I had to watch it again, didn't have the same spark it did the first time but i still really liked it.With so many great characters all locked in a small warehouse with a disaster situation and its black comedy edge it makes a great watch but I do think this will be a Marmite film where you either love it or hate it.Solid performance from the cast and a great story all set in one location with more gun fire then a Texas shooting range, add in some 70's black comedy and the awesome Armie Hammer, Cillian Mrphy and Sharlto Copley and you got a kick-ass film."
" What a strange movie!
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,8,"I would not have thought I would enjoy an hour straight of people shooting at each other, but I did!
It was engaging the whole time, I was never bored.
My only real problem was the lighting was so dark, and everyone was so grubby from crawling around (and being shot) it was a little hard to tell who was who and what was going on.
Well, that and the New York (New Jersey??) accents were really forced."
" Bit of harmless fun with brain firmly off
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,6,It's starts better than it ends and I liked ord. Worth a watch if you are stuck on Amazon but keep expectations low.
" my notes
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,3,"Not good. it was trying to go for a tone that wasn't hitting me right. it just seemed off for most of the movie. it was hard to tell when it was trying to be funny. and it was frequently confusing with respect to knowing what was happening in the scene, who was shooting at who, who everyone is and who's side they're on. it was cool in some ways but mostly bad with lots of dumb sprinkled in. (1 viewing)"
" Firing blanks or bullets?
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,7,"If you want to see an extended shootout set in one location complete with characters dragging themselves around with bullets and quips flying then this is your film. If you want something else, something more, then you will find this tiresome."
" Stylish flair and good cinematography can't make up for lack of structure.
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,5,"We get a brief set-up, but once the trigger is pulled, it's the same thing until the last few minutes. The cast is strong, but with a few exceptions the characters blend together. There's no individual motivations and the personalities and humor are too similar. Likewise the space is poorly defined. We need areas within the single setting to give a sense of location, movement and change, but it just blends together with the exception of a phone. We're supposed to fret about who will make it out, but mostly I was just waiting for it to be over."
" surprisingly, it was good
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,6,"Well , I saw this movie and I think it was good. the story was good, although it happened in one place only but I like it . the acting was good too, and there was some funny moments. overall , I really enjoyed watching it.6/10"
" An absolute blast!
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,10,"I really don't understand all the negative reviews ???
I personally, absolutely love this movie.
It's a Tarantino style film but with its own unique flavour from start to finish. Wonderful dialogue, gritty set and guns guns guns!
Comedy...Acton...and a fantastic cast."
" Free Fire Review
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,9,"1970s Boston, and Irishmen Chris (Cillian Murphy) and Frank (Michael Smiley) arrange to buy guns from Vernon (Sharlto Copley) in a deal set up by Justine (Brie Larson) and Ord (Armie Hammer). But an old grudge between two participants leads to a gun battle.
The most prolific and one of the most proficient filmmakers to come out of the UK in the last decade, Ben Wheatley has already proved himself across horror, thriller and whatever genre High Rise was (period sci-fi psycho-drama?). Now he moves to America - not literally; he's still shooting in Brighton - and establishes himself as an action director as well. Surely a nihilistic rom-com is next.Wheatley's economy of storytelling is impressive here. There are ten key characters and at least four groups in this story of an arms deal gone wrong, but their personalities and relationships are so briskly established that, when the bullets start flying twenty minutes in, we can predict who each person will target or protect. Or - this being Wheatley - we think we can. Comparisons to Reservoir Dogs are probably inevitable given the warehouse setting, copious firearms and endlessly quotable script, but this is a sleeker and more violent film (though perhaps less sadistic).
The story opens on a couple of Bostonian ne'er-do-wells, Bernie (Enzo Cilenti) and Stevo (Sam Riley). Stevo is bruised and sore after some sort of brawl the night before, but they've been hired by visiting Irishmen Chris (Cillian Murphy) and Frank (Michael Smiley) as muscle at an exchange of arms for cash, so Bernie holds him in line. The Irish pair are presumably Republican terrorists, but among this crowd, terrorists are at the more sympathetic end of the spectrum - particularly given Murphy's shy flirtations with Brie Larson's Justine, the fixer who has introduced the parties to this deal.Justine's counterpart is Ord (Armie Hammer), a nattily-dressed psychopath so calm he's almost horizontal, and the arms dealer is Sharlto Copley's Vernon. A peacocking braggart and obnoxious pervert in a bespoke suit, Copley commits utterly to his cringeing attempts to flirt with Justine and threatens to run away with the film. But instead, two supporting participants discover a standing grudge and a fight breaks out. Soon the air is filled with bullets - call it Chekhov's arms cache - and everyone is nursing at least one wound.Unlike the familiar American slugfests, this has surprises.
The hour of gunfighting that follows isn't quite as strong as Wheatley's previous films. While he and co-writer Amy Jump do a miraculously good job of shifting up the pace regularly, there's still a mid-film lag where the sniping threatens to become monotonous. And after a strong first half, it inches imperceptibly to its crescendo, a pay-off not quite as leftfield as his other work.Still, unlike the familiar American slugfests, this has surprises. There are moments where everyone tries to step back from the brink of mutually assured destruction, and pauses where they look for an exit strategy. What's more, these gunshots really hurt. A wound to the leg leaves people crawling, not running slightly more slowly like most action heroes. By the third act most of the survivors are on their bellies, grasping desperately at weapons only just out of reach. It's astonishing how novel that seems."
" Unnecessarily Complicated
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,3,"Semi-decent first & third acts collapse under the weight of an unnecessarily complicated middle, pointless dialogue, & a bizarre score that makes about as much sense as some of the director's shot compositions & editing choices."
" Interesting idea but could have been better
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,6,"One big shoot-em-up in a warehouse? Why not? Some good actors here, and some funny bits, but it could have been much funnier and more interesting. I did start to fall asleep at one point, but it got better afterwards."

" rip roaring laughter start to finish
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,9,"Stumbled upon this 90 minute comedy and oh my it was so funny. The story is not even a story, a group of guys enter a warehouse to do a deal, they want a bundle of guns and they have cash, lots of cash. the other guys with the guns enters and there is a bit of banter and it it gets out of hand when the van driver (with the guns) joins the party as he has already had a run in with the other side and suddenly all hell breaks loose.Two others enter the warehouse and everyone is shooting everyone, probably the longest shootout in the history of movie making and maybe real life. so we have 15 minutes to build the story then the remaining time is the shooting. i just laughed all the way through. not only bullets flying but bricks, rocks, shovels petrol, cupboards and well anything that can be a weapon is used and when you think someone has died they suddenly stir and another round is en route lol. a great comedy with literally no story... well worth a watch"
" Gritty & Entertaining
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,8,"I really loved this movie, it's quite a bit of senseless violence, but really is clever in the way they portray the characters. I know it's absurd but, I loved the ridiculousness of it. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously even in its most serious moments. Feels like watching an old western but shot in a more modern setting. Definitely NOT family friendly but a gritty/entertaining film."
" An arms deal goes wrong with bloody results
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,8,"In 1970s Boston a group of IRA gunrunners are planning to buy several cases of automatic rifles. The deal has been arranged and buys and sellers come together in a disused factory. Tensions are high and it isn't helped by the fact that the rifles aren't of the type expected. Things only get worse when it emerges that one member of each side had got into a fight the night before... it soon resumes and it is only a matter of time before the bullets begin to fly. Members of both sides take hits... then a third party starts shooting at both sides!This film gets off to a good start as we are introduced to the various characters and watch their deal get underway. This gently raises the tension and provides a good number of laughs. Then the action gets started because of something relatively minor and for the rest of the film the tension is very high. Characters crawl about trying to avoid the flying bullets and just about everybody gets injured. The arrival of the 'third party shooters' adds a sense of mystery as viewers and characters alike wonder who they are working for. Most films of this type feature lots of characters who die as soon as they are shot but here just about everybody gets injured, to the extent that they can barely stand, but few die until we reach the conclusion. Some of these deaths are quite unpleasant. The cast is impressive; most obviously Sharlto Copley as arms seller Vernon; Brie Larson as go-between Justine; Armie Hammer as Ord and Cillian Murphy as IRA man Chris. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody but I rather enjoyed it."
" Started well
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,1,"Started really well but then went down hill, by the end I couldn't care less what happened to them."
" Could have used a bit tighter plot
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,6,"When an arms deal goes wrong, both sides start shooting, but things take a real twist when an unknown third group enters the fray.Some truly interesting characters stand out, but as the title to my review already states, a sharper plot would have better defined the rest of them."
" Dull dull dull
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,2,"Free Fire - a preview viewing and Q and A with writer / director Ben Wheatley. The film has been compared with reservoir dogs apparently. For me, the only thing in common was a warehouse and shooting. In fact - the whole film was shooting. The most poignant bit in the film was when one of the protagonists said ""I don't know whose side I'm on"". As a viewer I didn't know either - and more to the point didn't care. Ben - stick to low budget like the brilliant Sightseers or Kill List."
" Ingenius
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,7,"Simple, isolated and impressive Wheatley's 'Free Fire' is a joy to watch. More clear cut than other works such as 'Kill List' this action romp is surprisingly funny and very accessible as a viewer. With distinct and extremely detailed characters the film is impressive and entirely worth your time"
" Worth a shot
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,8,Obviously similar to reservoir dogs and in a good way. The film manages to do a great job with character development during a constant gunfight and also with cinematography in the same warehouse the whole time. I did think the film could have used some higher stakes in all aspects though. Overall really enjoyable and memorable. A24 has not disappointed me yet.
" 90 POINTLESS MINUTES
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,1,"Nothing but bang bang, bang, bang for 90 minutes for absolutely no reason. Guns that never emptied, shots missed at point blank range and people still crawling round shot up like a cullender.
A shoot-up can be worth watching, but not this one."
" Utter rubbish.
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,1,"Easily one of the worst films I've ever seen. An international arms deal set up in a rat infested disused warehouse, with a group of people who seem to have little or no connections at all, except those that are vaguely hinted at. The accents I'm afraid were shocking, even Sharlto Copley's and he actually is South African! Whatever the rifles were they certainly weren't AR-14's, more like modern Ruger Mini-14's. And where to start on the hour long shoot out, the seemingly endless supply of ammunition each shooter was able to find, the multitude of hits each person took with no one actually dying till near the end. By my reasoning there were at least four trained marksmen in the building yet not one could hit a barn door at six paces. An utterly preposterous movie and a waste of 91 minutes of my life which sadly I can't get back."
" Lots of Guns, Lots of Insults, and Little Plot
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,7,"I enjoy a movie that doesn't pretend to be anything but what it actually is. That is the case with Free Fire. Its a single location, shoot 'em up film that doesn't try to act like its important movie making.Set in the 1970s, two gangs take part in a weapons deal inside a deserted warehouse in Boston. The deal goes sideways and the gangs start shooting at each other from almost point blank range. That's it for plot. The majority of the movie is the actors crawling around in the dirt and rubble of the warehouse trying to pick each other off. Its not rocket science, but it was fun.Armie Hammer, Brie Larsen, Cillian Murphy, and Shalto Copley are the head liners. The remainder of the cast were unknowns to me. The two gangs hurl insults and bullets are one another. They all get shot and/or injured and spend the movie bleeding and cursing at each other. Friends turn on each other, a third group appears shooting at them, someone has betrayed them. All this has a point which gets revealed later in the film, but its besides the point. If you like mindless action, funny dialogue, and impossible situations, this is the movie for you."
" A boooooring mess
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,2,"A sub mediocre movie directed by someone who probably thinks ""Manchester by the sea"" is an action packed experience and also did not spend more than a couple of hours in thinking the plot through. The wanna be racially/gender inclusive cast turns quickly into the predictable stereotyping one would expect. And the painfully unidimensional characters are as hard to watch as their poorly played accents are to stomach."
" Interesting
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,7,"It is the 1970s, and a small group of Irish republicans is in the USA arranging to buy automatic rifles from a South African supplier via a broker of illicit arms deals. No-one trusts anyone. As if that wasn't enough of a problem, it turns out that one of the Irishmen has an unhelpful drug habit. This fellow also fell foul of one of the American crew the previous evening. Oh, and there are a couple of snipers in the warehouse where the deal is taking place....Director and co-writer Ben Wheatley is flavour of the month in some quarters, despite having directed only a handful of cinema movies. Well, I saw A Field In England and High Rise, and I thought both were pretentious rubbish.But I'll cut him a break, because Free Fire definitely has something going for it. It's a really simple concept - an arms deal goes wrong, gunfire erupts, and there is an extended jockeying for position in a closed-in location (a derelict warehouse), with gunfire, over the next hour or so. What makes this film something to register on the radar is the way that hour is managed, and the dialogue within it. The set-up has established every character, so we understand personalities and motivations before all Hell breaks loose. I won't say that we care, because these are not nice people, but we are invested enough to want to see what happens to each of them, and who (if anyone) manages to escape alive.There is a good cast, headed by Brie Larson, Armie Hammer, Cillian Murphy and Sharlto Copley, all of whom give us nuanced characters. Copley, as is his tendency, goes wildly over the top but, then, that's how his character is written.And, importantly, notwithstanding the tension and death and destruction, there is a strong strand of dark humour running through this. I'm not saying you'll laugh out loud but, if you're anything like me, the script will please you."
" Highly enjoyable - if you like more than just froth
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,10,"Had this recommended by someone who's opinion I trust, which is a good job because based on what the other reviews said I probably wouldn't have bothered watching it.It's a great film - excellent characters, it's funny - and good fun to watch, I could go on but I haven't got time.Actually this seals the deal for me - I'm ditching IMDB after this - the vast majority of people on hear voting on movies are clearly not on the same page as me - anything challenging or leftfield just goes over most voters heads it seems and ends up with an average rating."
" This is the best movie Guy Ritchie wished he made.
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,8,"A great period piece, crime-gone-awry actioner in which quick shots of humor punctuate the chaotic violence with buckshot precision. Just a whole lot of bloody good fun crammed into 90 minutes."
" 10 word film review
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,7,He of Sightseers and Kill List delivers on every level
" Free Fire is a barrage of gunfire, witty one liners and a multitude of accents.
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,6,"If that sounds like your cup of tea then go ahead and give this a watch, you'll find it highly amusing. An arms deal goes terribly awry when a small fist fight turns into a factory shootout where nobody can be trusted. Think of this as a modernisation of 'Reservoir Dogs'. All set in one location, various personalities and plenty of violent profanity. Each character has their own accent and personable traits to differentiate themselves. A sarcastic American, an eccentric South African, a stupid Englishman and many more. I had to adjust my hearing for each character, I got there eventually. The chaos starts from one punch and, much like a ticking time bomb, escalates the tension and frantic mayhem. Approximately seventy minutes (excluding the introduction) of gunfire, verbal abuse and crawling along the floor. Literally. Bang Bang Bang ""You shot my suit!"" Bang Bang ""Your breath stinks and you have a serious case of BO!"" Bang Bang Bang. It kept me amused...for the first forty five minutes. The problem with using the same scenario and not changing it up for an entire film, is that it becomes tedious rapidly. There's no twists or turns, just two sides of a bad arms deal shooting each other. Couldn't keep my attention the whole way through. The amusement comes from the humorous screenplay and dialogue execution. Copley, Hammer, Murphy, Larson and everyone else manage to perform their lines in perfect comedic timing. You shan't be rolling on the floor laughing, yet it's enough to make you chuckle and smile. Heck I did, and I'm dead inside. Wheatley's directing style was clean, even amidst the chaos he was able to keep the camera and ensure we could see everything. The story, or lack of, is predictable however the writing style and acting is enough to withstand ninety minutes of carnage. Do not take this film seriously, it's just light hearted fun. I think I've seen enough guns for one day. Oh, and it seems most of these weapons have unlimited ammunition! Small nitpick..."
" shoot them up
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,5,"Various people arrive in a deserted warehouse to do an illegal gun deal. Shots are fired. This is essentially an extended shoot them up action play in a single room. The problem starts with a lack character exposition. This is important because it's hard to tell who is on which side. Once the shooting starts, it's hard to tell the geography or the teams. It's a lot of shots in the legs. It would be compelling if I cared about any of the characters. It may be more compelling to do this rooting for one side. I don't even care if either side wins, loses, or dies. That's a hard way to watch a shoot them up."
" Hilarious and entertaining.
",2018-02-09 00:00:00,7,"Brilliant casting for a wild, violent but hilarious movie.It like a Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie mash up. I love how the characters come together and how the tension builds up to the crazy free for all.Absolutely love Sharlto Copley and Armie Hammer characters here. Funny and witty. So well delivered."
" The worst shootout in the history of shootouts.
",2018-02-05 00:00:00,5,"For a movie that is basically an hour and a half of people shooting at each other, it is really boring and dull.
This movie is like playing a shooting game with your friends and realizing halfway through the game that you and your friends are really bad at video games.The movie had a simple idea and a good cast but unfortunately the writing shot it down."
" Free Firing on all Cylinders
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Ben Wheatley's 'Free Fire' venture is a shift towards more popular cinema, he did this with grace - and at no point did he sacrifice his own directing flair.Yes, this film has Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs' (1992) in mind; the use of one room throughout, a big bucks case that anyone could make off with, the huge element of trust, the use of a rock classic as a leading soundtrack, intense violence and suspense, and a big emphasis on characters and character development - but why is any of this a problem as some critics have pointed out? It simply worked here, and that's all that matters.Wheatley has proven himself to be a master of dialogue and character development; ""substance over style"" describes his approach perfectly; he managed to pull of the 'one room' formula, like Tarantino did, and keep it quite engaging.What needs to be understood is that this is a parody shootout film, a comedy, something Wheatley has always done exceptionally well; it's a funny, twisted caricature of criminals in a sticky, close-quarters situation with a Wheatley-grade touch of comedic realism that takes the mick out of generic action flicks - as very quickly all the seemingly infallible 'tough guy' characters were crawling due to gunshot wounds, this makes complete sense and is a humorous nudge to the viewer saying ""you expected a bunch of running and gunning?"" The fact there is no linear story is the point, it's a deliberately nonlinear hodgepodge - linearity would defeat the point of it. 
We could never expect Wheatley to make an orthodox action flick where everything just predictably falls into place, he flipped the script, everything falls out of place to great effect, it's calculated chaos done right.All in all, it's a weapons deal gone wrong at Shakespearean levels, the qualitative aspects of the film outweigh big-budget settings, firefights, CGI, car chases, and so on, Wheatley proves you don't need that. 
'Free Fire' doesn't ever try to take itself that seriously and this gives the whole film a brilliantly ironic 'laissez faire' attitude and flavour, while still being serious enough to keep the suspense up.It's not without flaws though, as a slow intro prompted me to begin to lose interest until things finally kicked off. I also felt like there were times when characters weren't doing enough to keep the momentum going. ""The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what fiction means."" -

" What an incredible waste of bullets!
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,2,"2018 is barely a week old, but I'm afraid I already stumbled upon the biggest disappointment of the year! Words literally fail to describe how incredibly dire and incompetent ""Free Fire"" is. Seriously, how is it possible that a film can superficially look so cool but then turn out to be so unbelievable irritable? In fact, the question ""how is it possible"" will form the red wire across this entire user comment. How is it possible that people are still imitating the success aspects of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" after more than twenty years? If there's one thing these movies have proven, it is that the combination of graphic violence and witty one-liners is rather unique and almost inimitable. Hundreds of rip-offs were unleashed, especially between 2000-2010, but none of them were truly worthwhile. Just when you think that nowadays aspiring directors are clever enough not to do so anymore, Ben Wheatley comes up with the most embarrassing rip-off of them all. How is it possible that I still have faith in Wheatley, anyway? Critics often label him as a multi-talented director, but this is the third letdown in a row after ""High-Rise"" and ""Sightseers"". I still want to see ""Kill List"", but if that's another disappointment, I'll never watch another Ben Wheatley film ever again. How is it possible that a film, which doesn't even have an actual script, is still so badly written? Simply put, ""Free Fire"" is set in 1978 and handles about an illegal weapon deal in an abandoned Boston warehouse between nervous IRA members and the gang of the sleazy and completely unreliable smuggler Vern. For the most banal reason imaginable, the already agitated situation goes awry and they all start shooting each other. How is it possible that anyone is still standing up after five minutes? Every single character gets shot, sometimes even in the head, but they all cheerfully continue reloading their arms and shouting idiotic stuff at each other. How is it possible that all these talented cast members got lured into this? ""Free Fire"" stars Cillian Murphy (""28 Days Later""), Sim Riley (""Control""), Brie Larson (""Room"") and Armie Hammer (""The Lone Ranger""), but they don't immediately seem to realize they're stuck in the worst project of their careers. And then the most vital question of them all: how is it possible that a film that features constant gunfire and bullet-showers is so damn boring! Despite all the Mexican stand-offs, the enormous body count and the sly dialogs, ""Free Fire"" is BORING beyond belief. The only reason why I'm giving this a generous rating 2 out of ten, instead of the miserable rating 1 it really deserves, is because I was rejoiced to hear a couple of long-forgotten John Denver classics on the soundtrack."
" lacking in everything
",2018-01-03 00:00:00,3,"I'd say style over substance but really the style is meh. Everything is amateur and really feels like a student film. Everything is boring and annoying after the first 10 minutes: from the acting, to the plot, to the cinematography, to the action, to the one location of the film.
Too much of the film is just things happening with no real progress and nothing is satisfying. It just keeps going. Characters die but you don't care either way. There is not good or bad guy, You hope everyone dies and there is no fun in it. The whole thing is filler and it struggles to reach it's 90 minute run time. 
3/10 because there were a couple neat images and ideas (some desktop wallpaper material). A very tiring film in the end not worth your time, just look at a few stills and move on."
" A Light Entertainer With Incessant Bullets
",2018-01-03 00:00:00,5,"This is the idiotic version of the Reservoir Dogs Movie , An arms deal gone sore on the folly of an asshole out of control and a sissy guy. Overall there is tangible entertainment for those who like gunshot movies but there is no compact story line here in the end movie turnout to be total disaster where no one escapes with money only regret at the end is the price of the enterprise go and watch the movie if nothing else you have for the weekend!"
" It's okay, but far from as great as it could have been.
",2018-01-03 00:00:00,7,"I must say that I'm a bit let down by this one. It is by no means a bad movie and in the end is fine, but going off of the very funny and fast paced trailers for ""Free Fire"" I was expecting a film that was going to be much more than simply ""fine"". To be fair, this could be a case where expectations tanked my perspective and slightly ruined my experience with this movie, but I still believe that this could have been something really spectacular.The plot, if you are not aware, is that two small groups of criminals get together to make a gun deal in an abandoned warehouse when it turns out one member from each side have a banter that resorts to a deadly shootout for all parties. From the start of the hysteria there is a lot of gun fire winding up in some humorous injuries and even deaths as they all seem to go down one by one.Although I can't say that I was ever irritated or even all that bored during the run time, I just was hoping for somewhat of a rapid fire pace with some humorous and witty dialog. This movie is a lot slower than I originally anticipated with the majority of the dialog resorting to the characters simply yelling ""F*ck you"" to one another in the middle of shooting, which grows relatively old after a while. Even though the film doesn't do anything inherently wrong at all, the material never rises above just being ""okay"". And that's fine for a movie to be...well...fine. But when I see a trailer that promises a hilarious comedy with high-octane action for 90 minutes only to deliver on a somewhat humorous and mildly entertaining quarrels with repetitive action, I can't help but feel let down; especially with the ending going with a disappointing resolve.""Free Fire"" for all its faults is alright. It did the job it was meant to by giving me some entertainment for an hour and a half, but ceases to go beyond that in any way. I will say it probably won't anger anyone who watches it, but it also won't be something that'll stick with viewers much either. All the actors do a fine job; the standouts for me being Armie Hammer, Sharlto Copely and Cillian Murphy doing what they can in order to give colorful enough characters to follow. Everyone else does well enough, but the material doesn't give anyone much to really work with. The story has a promising concept that's reminiscent of older works by Quentin Tarrantino or Guy Ritchie, but never fully lives up to that potential. The editing and camera work was fine, although it had trouble correlating where all the characters were in relation to each other through much of the movie; after a while I just gave up and accepted that they were shooting at each other even if they looked like they were shooting in the wrong direction. If you're looking for a movie to pass the time this certainly will do the job adequately enough."
" Complete Time waster
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,2,I couldn't care about any of the characters. Little plot or story line. Complete waste of time. One of the worst films I've ever seen. Absurdly bad. You couldn't pay me to watch it again!
" Had more potential, but---
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"There has been movies that had a very small space that have worked quite well. Phone Booth. Buried.This got about 70% there but was overcome with some poor choices. I read a bit about the production and watched the ""making of"" attachment on the DVD. Gave me some clues.Apparently much of the choice for it to take place in the '70s was due to cellular phones. Not much of a movie when you can call for help. But that choice also came with having some reference to it being the '70s. A few disco jokes? Someone served in Vietnam? Something like that. I think there was one passive reference to a guy's suit and that was it. And the John Denver 8-track, I suppose.Additionally the director apparently did quite a lot of research on shootouts and how they really go down. Then patterned the action to it.All well and good and seemed to reflect that because there was an absence of action and flash to it all. I'm glad it didn't flip to a Tarantino Xerox blood fest, but maybe more of early John Woo? Something more with a flair. Sure, there were slights-of-hand to the visuals, but hardly enough vs. the latitude that was there.And I thank it again for not going totally Tarantino with the dialogue and characters. Some as they were all criminals, so a comparison was inevitable. A distinction to each and every one was present with solid acting talent behind them.Yes, it was likely that such criminals would have said the ""F"" word just as frequently as the characters, but was a pain to listen to in a movie and took away from further potential exposition. Not that I was offended. It was just verbal junk.I also found the logistics suspect. I was not really sold on there not being any way out for any of the characters. Even the two ""surprise guests"" suggested they entered from a direction that would then provide escape for the others. But they were never used or tried. It was a subject that was just dropped. And the endless supply of bullets was growing tedious.The lead-up to the shoot out was engaging and entertaining, though. But had more to it on a whole that wasn't there. Room for another 10-15 minutes. So it shot itself in the foot in the end. (See what I did there, eh? Wink wink.)"
" An eye-rollingly childish waste of time,
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,5,"Wheatley continues to underperform with this tedious piece of juvenilia. It's bereft of the insidious tension that made Kill List so gripping and sorely lacks the heart, humour and offbeat charm of Sightseers. All Free Fire has is an adolescent script and a slew of utterly hollow characters in 70s fancy dress. As other reviewers have commented - you wish they'd just hurry up and kill each other."
" To gun fights what The Raid is to martial arts movies.
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,8,"What a terrific film; 30 minutes tense set-up of an arms deal going wrong, followed by an hour long gun fight. Incredibly, it's all coherent and there's a plot and characters with depth as well as being to gun fights what The Raid is to martial arts movies. Great stuff"
" Free Fire Review
",2017-12-19 00:00:00,6,"Free Fire is unfortunately Ben Wheatley's first misfire. Whilst the film isn't terrible by any stretch of the imagination, it does have a-lot of issues. Firstly the overall concept is an interesting idea. A 90 minute shoot-out in a single location sounds like a great idea. And for the first 30-40 minutes the film was highly entertaining. But when a character asks another ""how long has it been"" you know the film is starting to wear thin.The film is loaded with an extremely talented cast featuring Cillian Murphy, Brie Larson, Sharlto Copley, Michael Smiley. They all give boisterous, lively performances but their characters are paper thin. For the type of film this is I didn't need any character background, but a little bit of development and growth would've given the film a little more direction.One of the biggest issues I had with the film was that it meandered for the majority of the second half. This caused me to lose interest in the film as the overall intensity dropped. Another issue I had was the tone of the film, whilst it does have some good moments of levity, the film played itself far too straight. Going in I has expecting and action film with plenty of moments of dark humour, but that was few and far between. And a-lot of the jokes didn't land for me.Free Fire was an over-all disappointment made even more-so by the fact I'm a huge fan of Ben Wheatley. In the end Free Fire was an interesting experiment that seemed better in concept rather than in its execution."

The same applies with this.I watched the film, and then went back and watched the first 15 minutes all over again... It's one of those films where so many characters are introduced in a short space of time, that it works better when you've got it all straightened out in your head who everybody is (at least for me).Once the first shot is fired in anger, the character beats kind of get lost in a hail of bullets, which I thought was a shame, as I was enjoying the crackling dialogue... It all depends on whether you want one particular type of film, instead of a messy blend of two styles - both are done well, they just don't really work, together!"
" Looks good, but lacks basic filmmaking qualities
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,5,"FREE FIRE is another disappointing effort from British director Ben Wheatley, following on from HIGH RISE. This is his version of RESERVOIR DOGS, with a bunch of rival characters holding up in a ruined warehouse when an arms deal turns sour and vendettas turn deadly. Wheatley's films always look good and you can't fault the photography, but the problem - as ever - lies in his wife Amy Jump's script. It fails to develop characters properly, and as such there's no kind of suspense or realism here at all.What you get are characters indulging in an improbably long shoot-out which takes up almost all of the running time. When you see that Brie Larson is randomly present in the story you can guess the oh-so-obvious twist ending from the outset. There's a lot of violence but very little death for the most part, with everyone being shot multiple times but failing to die, somehow. The last half an hour is better but still only average. The best thing about the film are some well-judged and funny performances from old reliables like Armie Hammer, Sharlto Copley, Michael Smiley, and Cillian Murphy."
" Great Cinema
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,9,"Pretty Funny Crazy Movie LOL Love it, My Rating 9 out of 10 because I think Chris 'Cillian Murphy' didn't deserve to be shot by Justine 'Brie Larson', I particularly like this scene among others where Vernon 'Sharlto Copley' gets his nose shot LOL, Gonna watch this masterpiece many times again, So if you're a bit crazy like me i guess, i highly recommend this movie, Enjoy"
" A shoot-em-up that fires blanks
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,2,"There will never be anything that can take away the fact British director Ben Wheatley delivered one of the great sophomore films of recent times when he unleashed Kill List onto the unsuspecting movie-going public in 2011.A brilliant and sensory exploding experience, Kill List instantly set Wheatley out as a filmmaker to take note of but sadly since that event, Wheatley has struggled to capture the filmmaking brilliance of his sophomore effort, even if he remains a unique and hopefully still a filmmaker that's works represent his undeniable talents.Since the time of Kill List's release there was the low-budget oddity A Field in England, the divisive Sightseers, the sporadically brilliant yet forgettable High-Rise and now the most disappointing Wheatley feature film of all, Free Fire.A terribly misguided and frankly lifeless action/comedy, Free Fire is the type of film with a loaded cast and an idea that on paper must seem brilliant but as an end product, this ammo heavy experience fires blanks on all cylinders.Never once threatening to become exciting or even funny enough to justify its existence, Wheatley fails to enliven this tale of a group of colourful criminals shooting at each other for an hour straight in an abandoned warehouse after a gun deal turns bad and wastes a downright fantastic cast on material that needed more than a quick polish and shine.Wheatley's wastes an A-list cast that includes headliners Brie Larson, Cillian Murphy, Armie Hammer and recognisable faces and character actors like Noah Taylor, Michael Smiley, Sharlto Copley and Jack Reynor, as the collection of actors spend more than half their screen time either grimacing in pain or without a word of the lie, crawling around the ground of the warehouse as they slowly but surely dwindle in numbers.For a film so focused on just being one big long firefight, there's no imagination or inventiveness with anything that's happening on the action front which makes the bullet-ballet nothing more than a tiresome experience and most tellingly of all, we never care about who survives and who doesn't, taking away any tension or thrills we may've got from hoping our favourite baddies would escape from the carnage around them and get away with the suitcase of money at the heart of the deal gone bad.Final Say – Free Fire is boring, tiresome and generally uninteresting. I'm still a huge Wheatley fan and believe he still has a bright filmmaking future but this Martin Scorsese backed event is his worst feature film yet and another unfortunate step backwards from the highs of Kill List.1 crawling criminal out of 5"
" Not very engaging...
",2017-11-08 00:00:00,2,"I attempted to watch this movie at least 5 or 6 times and kept turning it off at about the 10-15 minute mark each time before finally finding myself bored enough to sit through it...I watch all types of films and rarely do I find myself unable to focus or remain engaged. This one managed to do just that. I simply could not get myself into it no matter how hard I tried. There were some mildly humorous scenes peppered through-out but the majority of the movie is just one scene of someone shooting a gun cut to another scene of a person shooting a gun into another scene of a person shooting a gun and so on....some random dialogue sprinkled through-out which I simply did not give a s*%# about at that point any-how. Cut back to random people shooting random bullets into random areas of the ware-house that we remain in for the entirety of the film. I'm perfectly fine with the single setting, but you have to give me a lot more than profile shots of random individuals shooting guns. Otherwise I might find myself fiddling with random objects around me and my mind starting to wander.""Pew pew..pow pow...pew...pew...""Perhaps one of the least engaging movies I've seen in recent memory, (nothing like Reservoir Dogs as a previous review mentioned) which is kind of strange because reading the synopsis and some of the reviews I figured otherwise. Quite a strong cast too, but over-all an extremely under-whelming and forgettable experience. Not my cup of tea."
" A very entertaining and actually quite funny movie
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,7,"Free Fire is a movie about this group of criminals that has a meeting with another group of criminals for an arms deal. But, because of one idiot on each side, things go south and all hell breaks loose.So, basically, the whole movie is like a really long action sequence. The whole plot of the movie is that shoot- out and that's it. Nothing more. Don't go into it expecting anything beyond the surface. The characters are kinda unlike-able and likable at the same time. They are awful people so it's hard to connect, but they keep you interested with witty dialogues. The performances are pretty great (especially Sharlto Copley) and the action is fun. Not really intense because you don't really care about these people, but it's fun. You don't really want desperately for anyone to survive, but there are some that you'd like to see get killed more than others. Although not intense, it's chaotic nature, black comedy and fun action are sure to keep you entertained. It's nothing extraordinary, but you can check it out if you're interested."
" A thriller more hit and miss than all the bullets flying about in it
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,7,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In 1970s Boston, a group of IRA members meet in an abandoned warehouse to broker an arms deal. The dealers, in the shape of the colourful Vernon (Sharlito Copley) and Martin (Babou Ceesay) arrive and the deal looks set to go ahead, until a personal dispute between two outside members triggers an all out shootout that spirals out of control and threatens to leave them all dead.After the visually illuminating but aesthetically alienating High Rise left his followers divided, writer/director Ben Wheatley has shown an unexpected affection for Tarantino with this off-kilter crime thriller, shot in one long, continuous take in the same location, driven only by atmosphere and dialogue. An all star cast, including Cillian Murphy, Brie Larson, Sharlito Copley and Wheatley favourite Michael Smiley drive it all along, even if all their characters collectively have nothing to define them between themselves.While the screenplay is jazzy and smooth enough, and the attention to 70s style and fashion fairly spot on, somehow it just never reaches a QT level of sophistication, and the script is never really interesting enough to completely hold your attention until the end. All the frenetic shooting, or 'free fire', is not enough on its own to satisfy all but the most undemanding of viewers. It's fun, but in the hands of someone else, it may well have been more fun.This is a strange choice of project for Wheatley to take up in his ever increasingly bizarre project range, and the end result is simply something very hit and miss that just scrapes by. ***"
" A movie about guns only
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,7,"I remember about ten years ago someone said they wanted to make a movie that was all about shooting people. It seems that another person decided to do that and made Free Fire. I'm not complaining a bit about this. The movie was good, but there were just a few things that happened that made it so I wouldn't give it a higher rating.First off, Armie Hammer's character, Boyd, has to be the worst body searching in the world. Even though it doesn't show it in the movie it is implied he searched everyone. And everyone had a freaking gun going into the meeting even though Boyd was supposed to be the only one.Speaking of the guns the characters carried in, one thing I don't like is when they don't reload. I'm not saying the characters didn't reload, because they did. Well, they did after their respective firearms would have been out of ammo. Most of the weapons used in the movie were revolvers or .45 pistols. The revolvers at most held six rounds, and the .45s at most could hold eight or nine depending on the manufacture. What was great about the movie was the continuity in timing. They were operating out of a tiny space in a warehouse without many places to hide. Having to crawl around on the floor and getting behind various rubble was done masterfully. You could tell none of the characters had any type of military training, but they did know how to get out of the way of getting shot at.The comedy is what really sold this movie. There was so much mixed in with the gun it worked out. It almost helped the story along because there is only so much you can do with a story involving a gun deal gone bad and a shootout ensues. Hammer's comedy was easily the best in the movie.All in all, I would say watch this movie. With exception to the reloading, most of the movie was quite realistic. Even down to the braining.Rating: 7 out of 10"
" Ever watched a 80 minute long shootout, this might be your first time.
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,7,"I bought this movie on DVD because i was attracted by the cover art and the idea of an 1970's style action comedy, so why not. Although i read a few reviews here from people who called it boring, i immediately thought STOP READING STOP READING. Don't ruin the whole movie because of a few negative reviews, first of all (with out trying to spoil anything) the movie is basically one big shootout filled with absurd situations and silliness. And i could imagine that some viewers might not like the idea of a whole feature film build around a shootout, but i can honestly say that they did a good job on keeping the whole thing interesting. If you enjoy gangster comedies or anything in the vain of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, i would say give it a try."
" A Modern Day Reservoir Dogs
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,7,"Not every film has to be the next Titanic or Gone with the Wind. Not sure why I decided on those two films, but sometimes it's nice to enjoy a nice 90-minute action comedy. Free fire is undeniably chaotic, bloated with violence, and entirely irreverent. But it's also full of charisma, wit, and some dang good action. Balancing all of those things is a tough task, luckily Free Fire as a whole has more shots connected than the characters themselves do.Starring, Cillian Murphy, Armie Hammer, Brie Larson, Sharlto Copley, and Jack Reynor (among many others), this is as about as modernized Reservoir Dogs as you can get. Everyone comes in with their own agendas and rarely does a character fully commit to the side he or she is on. The one thing you can count on is everyone giving a great performance. No performance here is going to win any Oscars, but they all know exactly the type of movie they are in, and act accordingly. To me, the standouts are Copley and Hammer. I've been critical of Hammer in the past for just feeling too generic in certain roles (see: The Man From U.N.C.L.E.), but he certainly doesn't fall victim of that here.Perhaps the strangest part about the film is that you get no context for this meeting between two gun gangs at all. Within the first 10 minutes, the gangs are already having disagreements and ready to blow each other's brains out, yet the relationships between the two groups works really well. It also doesn't hurt that the script is rapidly paced and quippy from beginning to end.My one complaint with the film is that after a while it gets rather tiring. One location with hundreds upon hundreds of bullets flying left and right can be an exhausting experience. The action is somewhat freshly directed, with a calmer approach to say Kingsman, but still more over-the-top than your average action thriller. It's also hard not to see the lack of execution with Brie Larson's character. This lady is an Oscar winner, don't belittle her to someone men have to save. She isn't always that in Free Fire, but there was much more potential to have her be a worthy character here, especially considering she's the only female character. Other than that, I can't really complain. Free Fire is a joy, albeit a tad chaotic.7.2/10"
" The night of bullet business!
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,6,"This is one of the surprise films of the year. A limited cast and a one day event film. Except the opening few minutes the remaining film was a crossfire event. It's about two groups caught up in a firing from each other from one mistake to another leading the confrontation. In an abandoned warehouse, with a big amount and the cases new weapons lying in the centre, there's no way in or the out. The only way is to fight them all. So the surviving game begins. Whoever wins at the end can take it all with him.A very nice concept. With a simple storyline a nice gang fight was drawn out. If you like gangster films, this should watch it. But what bothered me the most was the common logic. You know, they all entered the building after checked for if they are armed, though it can be believed they hid their weapon somewhere and proceeded in. That's not it, the ammos for their gun, they kept firing many rounds like in the army conflict or a video game. That's why it is average to me. Otherwise an unexpected awesome film.The casting was good, but the surprise was Brie Larson. To see the Oscar winner in such kind of small scale film. Also disappointed her role was very small. But there is still hope! All others were good. With their unique characters, nicely used to share the screen equally. The reason for the conflict is not well explained, so it is hard to say who's good and who's bad guys here. But behaviours and further development give out where the story is heading. The end was predictable, and also we can expect a sequel. If they have one in their mind, surely it would only get bigger.6.5/10"
" A B-Movie with a Good Cast
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,7,"This is a classic B movie, conceptually. Two underworld mobs filled with a variety of not quite right characters, a sexy dame in the middle, a seedy warehouse, and an weapons buy. The movie doesn't waste much time with setting up characters, and it doesn't need to. Each character is quirky, an old school tough guy, a wannabe hipster pothead trying to act cool, a clever IRA boss, a South African who thinks he's cool with his business like black partner, and a couple of other low lever boozehounds, drug addicts and hanger-ons trying to impress bosses and/or the sexy dame.The plot is simple and the action starts up quickly, no need to give anything away.The movie is elevated by a great cast. Larson, Murphy, Hammer, Riley, Copley, Clienti are all excellent. Jack Reynor, I didn't know but he plays a key part and is good. Each character has a different accent. Boston, Irish, South African...they all inhabit the characters and bring them to life. You get the feeling they had fun doing this shoot-em-up caper film. It gives each of them a chance to shine a little bit in their role.The movie unfolds with a few action, some laughs, and plot twist and a classic ending. You learn nothing, but you're not meant to. There is not much more you can want from a light weight film.Or is there? Somehow you feel like this doesn't quite hit it out the park. The concept is there. The actors are there. Everything seems right, but it's a little off. You can't help but notice that Tarantino and Guy Ritchie have both done this type of movie better. The characters are quirky, but not quite over the top enough. The direction is gritty and straight-forward, but not quite as stylish. The dialogue is good, but not great. It feels like there was a chance here to make a really memorable movie in that vein, but it all is just a tad too conventional when held up to the standard that has been set for this type of film."
" Free Fire for Free Entertainment
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,7,"The premise of this film is pretty simple. There are two gangs that are going to exchange money for guns and then trouble strikes. Until here everything looks normal, like in others movies, two band gangs waiting for an exchange but at some point something doesn't go right. And from here is where the magic of this movie starts. Not only things start going into a downfall, but they do not have a limit, the start and don't seem to stop!It is at that point, when the shooting starts that this movie really starts. The way it's made it might remind you of the masterpiece that is ""Reservoir Dogs"", but remember, this is no Tarantino and that does not mean that this movie is bad, it's just different. Everybody starts shooting at some point and you can watch the dark humor with which it is being done, because although it's kind of gangster movie without the hats, it's really hilarious the situations where everybody finds themselves at some point through the story.The cast is just brilliant. Each of them plays their roles really cool and it's true that at some point you might find it difficult to follow them and remember who is who, but it is really normal as the camera never stops rolling. You might pick up a favourite one really fast and trying to guess what they are going to do or what is going to happen. Who is going to get the money? And the guns? Being the movie adapted in the 70s is always a plus just to see the clothes and hairstyles that everyone is wearing.A movie to enjoy a good time and a good time to enjoy a movie. Just watch it and enjoy it."
" Lots of funny quips and action.
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,7,"This is a rather light but exciting mix of action and comedy. There are a few very believable characters and a couple that get a bit too one dimensional and that's where it lets viewers down. The ending is a little predictable, but some of the scenes extremely memorable. This isn't going to make the top films every made, but if you have a couple hours this movie is well worth watching. Warning this IS a movie that is pretty much an hour and a half long shootout. So if you are squeamish about gunfights this is probably not the movie for you."
" Godard once quipped that ""All you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun."" Ben Wheatley heard him.
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,7,"You can practically hear writer/director Ben Wheatley cackling at the pundits of senseless, depraved violence in cinemas while pitching Free Fire - savagely experimental, darkly comedic revisionist action flick which is - no exaggeration - roughly 80% shootout. The impression is of Wheatley getting his hands on a '90s era Reservoir Dogs knockoff, riddling the script with a machine gun, and treating each bullet hole at face value. Is it gimmicky with a limited shelf life? Sure. But is it a worthwhile experiment, and oodles of fun even as it overstays its welcome? Bet yer feckin' arse. If Christopher Nolan sought to bottle the noise and chaos of war with this summer's Dunkirk, Wheatley matches him with a film every bit as sensorially overwhelming, but anchored by colourful archetypes spewing savagely funny zingers and a deluge of profanities at each other between yelps and grunts of pain and the omnipresent boom of gunfire. Film scholars have long loved to wax poetic about action interludes as performative musical numbers, but Wheatley pioneers a form of anti-spectacle action, treating gunplay as part of the dialogue, and the film as a whole as a furious debate. Bursts of bullets serve as proclamations, rebuttals, and killer arguments are made rather literally. The splashy but sparse soundtrack helps to jazz things up a little, but for such a pressure cooker situation, apart from Armie Hammer and Sharlto Copley's blindingly flamboyant '70s suits, there's little to no visual pizazz - it's all part of the din. And there's the rub - if Wheatley spun Free Fire as a p*ss take of bloated Hollywood gunplay, it's his own satirical bent that calls his film's own bluff. Namely, fun as their caustic banter, verbal and cordite, can be, it still gets quite boring watching a group of eejits yelling and shooting at each other for well over an hour without break. Over time, as the comparatively short run time feels increasingly cavernous, we grow to long for personal conversation of any semblance of depth, plot, or even a respite from the maelstrom of sound, like we're lost in the desert without water. Tailing his 2015 period piece political satire High Rise, one would at least expect Wheatley to worm in some scathing social commentary, especially when weaving in the '70s IRA conflict into a genre lambasted for desensitizing audiences to gun violence. Well, if there is any commentary to be gleaned, it's hard to hear - in more ways than one. Still, in a sense, Wheatley may have the last laugh, as it all ultimately rolls into a macro satire of everything - politics, pacing, coherence, common sense, and even giving the customer what they want - falling to the wayside once guns are actually drawn. The epitome of 'shoot first and ask questions later?' It seems we've just found it. How Wheatley convinced such a talented cabal of actors to primarily spend their days crouching behind supply crates yelping in pain is beyond me, but his investment pays off: without the cast, Free Fire, quite simply, would have little in its favour to convince any audiences to stick around. Thankfully, his troupe is more than up for the challenge. Brie Larson makes for a perfectly coy moral centre, remaining as sphinx- like as she is suave, keeping the audience consistently guessing as to her ultimate allegiances. Cillian Murphy and Michael Smiley lend the film a credible streak of unshowy, no-nonsense class, while Sam Riley and Armie Hammer have a hoot hamming it up, balancing debonair airs with bug-eyed, incredulous outbursts. Sharlto Copley, in particular, practically foams at the mouth masticating scenery, but the film welcomes his bursts of zaniness, and Copley is careful to say on the right side of cartoony to remain interesting. It may be more performance art piece than memorable bastion of cinema, but Free Fire certainly emerges as a far more coherent and cleverly assembled counterpart to other equally inexhaustible attempts at milking the dizzy spectacle of the action genre for all its worth (remember 2016's Hardcore Henry? I thought not. What about 2005's Domino? Yeah, I try not to either. Shudder). With an endearingly acrid ear for dialogue, a-la Tarantino or Martin McDonagh, Wheatley's band of miscreants may not be likable, memorable, or do very much, but it's surprisingly entertaining watching them doing the little they do as noisily as they do it. So, the next time a relative jeers at how senselessly, gratuitously violent Hollywood cinema has become, sit them down in front of Free Fire. They'll either adjust their standards accordingly, chuckling at its tongue- in-cheek excesses, or be too deaf from the cascade of endless gunshots to argue much. Either way is a moral victory of sorts. Maybe.-7/10"
" A childish concept, which isn't necessarily a bad thing
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,6,"The decade following the release of Quentin Tarantino's two-punch of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction saw many independent filmmakers clamouring to try and recreate the magic of those crime movies, which catapulted the one-time video store clerk to directorial super stardom. Stripped of his ear for witty dialogue and everything else that made them stand out, most of these imitations simply consisted of bad men pointing guns at each other whilst talking pop culture. This craze has since died down, but based on Ben Wheatley's latest venture Free Fire, there are those still longing to recreate the magic of those 90's classics. Free Fire is the cinematic equivalent of pillaging your toy box as a child and have the most colourful figures shoot it out with one another for the flimsiest of reasons. However, this isn't entirely a bad thing.In 1970's Boston, a bunch of mean-looking men and one woman meet at an abandoned warehouse to finalise an arms deal. IRA members Chris (Cillian Murphy) and Frank (Wheatley regular Michael Smiley) meet with intermediary Justine (Brie Larson), and eventually with charming connect Ord (Armie Hammer looking very comfortable rocking a 70's beard). Arms dealer Vernon (Sharlto Copley) has some bad news in that he doesn't have the guns ordered, but the Irishmen push ahead for the deal anyway. A rocky introduction seems to be heading towards peaceful resolution, until Vernon's associate Harry (a hairy and bespectacled Jack Reynor) recognises junkie Stevo (Sam Riley) - one of Chris and Frank's gang - from a violent confrontation the night before. Negotiations quickly escalate into a stand-off between both parties, and a huge shoot-out ensues. With a briefcase full of money and a truck load of guns there for the taking, everyone's motivation and loyalty is quickly under scrutiny.After tackling the lofty concept of socioeconomic commentary in messy misfire High Rise, Wheatley has fallen back on a simplistic and indulgent crowd-pleaser. With many an object to hide behind in the expansive warehouse setting, the witty dialogue of the opening thirty minutes becomes a cycle of leg-and-shoulder wounds and ricocheting bullets. It's a rather childish concept, but it manages to entertain by refusing to take itself seriously. Fracturing loyalties and double-crosses play second fiddle to guessing who will die next and just how they will meet their doom, backed by an impressive line-up of character actors. Outside of a couple of gruesome deaths, the script by Wheatley and long-time writing partner Amy Jump offers few surprises. Perhaps the couple needed to recuperate after their ambitious but ultimately disappointing attempt to bring High-Rise to the big screen. Whatever the reasoning for tackling a project so knowingly lacking in scale and originality, I enjoyed it, and hopefully now it's out of their system they will be capable of delivering a film as masterful as their jewel in the crown, Kill List."
" Rating: C-
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,4,"When I read the premise for this film, I thought ""this is like a 15min scene from a random action movie turned into a feature length one"" ... Well, I was not wrong. There's nothing overwhelming about this, it's literally some people shooting at each other because of one lazy major plot point that starts the whole thing.There are no character development scenes whatsoever and one can argue that this movie doesn't need them, but the truth is that I couldn't care less for any of them which makes the whole shootout a little boring unless the action is fun and entertaining. So, is the action ""fun and entertaining"" or not really?It is, but not in the amount that it needs to be. For a movie with 85 min of runtime, I expect an incredibly well-directed action film, full of suspenseful moments and unpredictable twists ... However, the action becomes repetitive after a while and it's not filmed in a way that I can actually understand what's happening, there's a lot of hand-held camera technique, so obviously, there are a lot of scenes with shaky cam ... In some scenes, I can't figure out who is shooting at who and where everyone is!Also, this film has a lot of comedy, one-liners mostly. Although some of them work, they aren't enough to save the movie from becoming boring at a certain point of the runtime, where I can only see people crawling and bickering at each other, with some jokes falling flat. This is a movie filled with clichés, from the set-up of the whole thing (that I still think is just ... stupid) to the way the film proceeds until the very end.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a disaster! There are a few praises that I can't just ignore. The cast is great as expected: Brie Larson is amazing, Cillian Murphy (Chris) is the most interesting character and Armie Hammer (Ord) is by far the funniest one.The action, even if it does turn repetitive and a bit boring by the end, it's still captivating enough to watch a shootout in a confined space for more than one hour (if you don't know me by now, my favorite type of movies are the ones with suspenseful, one-location thrillers, full of mystery and entertaining action ... Not that Free Fire achieves all of this, but it still nails one or other aspect).Most of the one-liners give me chuckles, but never more than that. The plot is pretty simple since this is a straightforward action film which might entertain most of you on a Sunday afternoon when you have nothing else to do at home.All in all, Free Fire has a very simple premise that doesn't work that well in a feature-length film since everything loses steam midway. The action is entertaining, but it becomes repetitive and boring. The humor is good, but it doesn't always land. The plot is simple but too predictable, full of clichés, with under-developed characters and it has a major plot point that is just stupid. Ben Wheatley could have directed the shootouts better and the only reason why this film is still a bit entertaining is due to its cast, some funny one-liners and the fact that this is an all-out action film, in a confined space and with a lot of bullets flying around.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" one of the most boring movies ever watched
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,5,"Don't waste time on this..it is only about mad guys shooting each other under no plot whatsoever. I've found it flat overall..no depth and no flow...I ended up skipping scenes till the last image. It's a real shame because the trailer was very exciting, and so the overall 70s vibe, music and colors."
" A lot of nothing
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,5,"This movie is one of the single most boring ones I've seen in years. The cast was great but the movie was just awful. You really can't tell who is who or why. So many things go wrong that just don't add up, nor are there any answers given. A total waste of time. If I wanted to watch people getting shot and crawling for all their worth, the entire movie, I'd have rented ""Reservoir Dogs"", at least that was a great movie. Don't waste your time on this movie because of the cast, it is not worth it."
" Great ""Tarantino-ish"" movie
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,8,"Great movie. I love the fact that people can make movies that take place in limited spaces and make it interesting during the whole movie.I didn't lose interest one second. Its not your average shoot-em-up movie and you really have to take a seat to follow the dialogues, but its worth it.If you love 1970-ish style movies with some humor, good rich characters and a tiny hint of Tarantino influence in it... you gotta see this one."
" Fully Loaded
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,7,"I saw the trailer for FREE FIRE a while back and thought it looked to be an interesting film. Armie Hammer in one of the lead roles made me think could this be the breakout film for him? The more movies I've seen him in the better he has gotten. Well he does a great job here but I finished watching this unsure if I really liked it or not.The year is 1978, the city Boston and the fight in Ireland still rages between the IRA and the British Army was still raging. The film opens with two low level hoods sitting and waiting to be called in. Bernie and Stevo (Enzo Cilenti and Sam Riley) are talking about their problems and the fight Stevo got into earlier. Beaten badly in the confrontation he says that if he ever runs into the same guy again he's going to kill him.The pair are told to come along by the men in charge, Stevo's brother in law Frank (Michael Smiley), Chris (Cillian Murphy) with Justine (Brie Larson) with them. Members of the IRA they are here to purchase weapons for the fight back home. While there is no love lost between Stevo and Frank, they are related. An addict and womanizer Stevo is only there because of a sense of family. They enter a warehouse and wait for the sellers.The sellers are led by Vernon (Sharlto Copley), his partner Martin (Babou Ceesay) and hired gunman to make sure things run smoothly Ord (Armie Hammer). Vernon is a talker and mover, a South African expatriate looking to make money. Ord is the cool, calm and collected go between trying to make sure nothing gets out of hand.The two sides meet, discuss terms they already set and show off the wares brought along. Chris is unhappy because the agreed upon weapons are different than those he ordered. Vernon tells him he's lucky these were available. After a short discussion and the exchange of money, Vernon calls for the truck to bring in the rest of the guns. And this is where things go wrong.Harry (Jack Reynor), the man driving the truck, turns out to be the same guy that beat up Stevo. Stevo tries to avoid him but Harry eventually sees who he is and leaps toward him, trying to beat him up once again. It seems Stevo hurt someone close to Harry which is what set the fight in motion. As each group tries to calm down the two, Stevo launches a verbal assault on Harry who pulls out a gun and shoots him. Which leads to all parties pulling out weapons and firing at one another.No, this is not the entire movie. This is only perhaps the first 20 minutes or so. The remaining 70 minutes is a back and forth wounding of everyone involved with banter being tossed back and forth, accusations made and verbal abuse called from one side to the other. Yes, this is a 70 minute shoot out. But here is where a touch of realism comes in. No one seems able to mortally wound someone on the other side. Yes, they all get shot but only wounded. Which means that rather than the standard run and shoot movie we are used to it becomes more of a crawl to a hiding place and shoot film. And until it ends we have no idea who if any of those involved will survive.What there is to love about this movie are the characters and the portrayal of those characters by these great actors. All of the side characters are well fleshed out here and given the short time to understand who they are each actor does a great job on making them real. The lead actors are amazing to watch. Copley has become something to see and his fast talking arms dealer just adds to the list of characters he's played. Murphy as the calm member of his team plays it smooth while at the same time an underlying sense of danger exudes from him. Hammer is fantastic, displaying a sense of humor in his character, perhaps the most deadly of all involved who not only knows his weapons but has a grasp of strategy as well. And Larson as a woman trying to help broker and deal and make money is an equal to the rest.The question comes can a 70 minute shoot out involving everyone crawling from one spot to another be an interesting film or not? The answer is yes it can. Director Ben Wheatley is considered one of those up and coming directors that everyone talks about. What he's done here is taken a standard shootout and made it something new. There is a deft combination of action, suspense and twisted humor that works for the most part. But while it works, as you near the end it can become tiresome. Had the film run more than 90 minutes it would have flipped from doable to torture. As it stands it is one worth watching, especially if like me you enjoy your humor dark. Will it stand up to multiple viewings? I'm not sure. But it one you might like at least once."
" Shoot'em Up
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,7,"What makes another shooter gangsta film so memorable apart from the hordes of others? First, I was absolutely convinced that this was a period film resurrected from the past ('70s); they were that convincing with props, sets, costumes, makeup (especially hair), dialogue. Was I fooled! It was made around 2016. Second, it was absolutely comically farcical in that the seemingly endless ammunition (quantity often missed/unintentional in film) was purposefully scripted, and the ensuing shooting carnage was a torrent of misses and near misses. You were sure to wonder to yourself - could they hit the broadside of anything large. Third, the instigation to this carnage itself was just as bizarre, and you could see it coming. Often one FF through endless shootouts, but I found myself wondering - hit or not hit; survive or not survive. Fourth, endings are often confusing, non-existent, interpretive, or pablum. This one had an appropriately satisfying note to it."
" Fire it up!
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,9,"Well, I loved it! When an arms deal goes wrong, the bullets fly! It'd take a more observant viewer than I, and with all pardons to Barry Manilow, but I'd love to know ""just who shot who?"" Holy smokes! Everyone was great, loved the dialogue, and for me, just the absurdity of the whole thing just made me love it more! And I loved, loved, loved, the use of John Denver's ""Annie's Song"" - both times! Brilliant! Everyone in this film gets shot, everyone gets filthy, and everyone... well, suffice to say, the title is really the movie! Free fire indeed! Still, I'd like to hear that John Denver story..."
" The GUN-DEAL went wrong. . .
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,7,"SO they tried, blowing each other's heads-off in a series of absolute chaotic VIOLENCE and cynical HUMOUR, instead!It's difficult to say which is sharper in Ben Wheatley's latest film, Free Fire: the bullets being fired by the nefarious characters found within or the witty jabs those characters tend to fling at one another between the continual barrage of deadly gun-play. One may kill you, but the other may actually hurt your feelings. As with his previous films, Wheatley presents Free Fire with a gleefully dark sense of humour, the ridiculousness of events playing out made all the more senseless when you take into account where everyone's mindset is at. That sense of humour – not to mention the abhorrently comical characters – washes the onslaught of violence down all the easier, though, and, with Free Fire, Wheatley once again proves to be a unique voice in the filmmaking world.A British film set in America, deals about a gun deal in 1970's Boston gone wrong, Free Fire's director moves his characters into play with stealth and precision. Nor does there appear to be a wasted opportunity when it comes to the cast. Each character is allowed their own sense of levity, some laying on the ham a little stinger than others, but it all suits the character at hand. Larson gives a strong performance as the seemingly most rational person in the room as she screams for everyone to ""calm the f*ck down"" to no avail. Copley, on the other end of the spectrum, is a delight of silliness, something the actor tends to lean towards in most of his performances, but it suits his Free Fire character just fine. He seems to be the least self-aware person in this room of violence, but that allows him the more juvenile moments of humour here.The remainder of the cast is weighed down by solid performances, as well. Hammer and Murphy play equal parts cool but with a slight tinge of macho-headed fatuity. Smiley, a longtime performer under Wheatley's direction, is always a sight for sore eyes. Riley and Reynor play similar levels of character on either side of the bullet barrage: slimy and completely lizard-brained but not without a modicum of adorable oafishness. Theirs are probably the funniest to watch amongst all the chaos through and through.All of this comes together in a wonderfully dark but unnervingly funny action ride courtesy of one of the best filmmakers working today. The attention to detail Ben Wheatley and his crew show makes its presence felt in all aspects of Free Fire, some of them with that added bonus of piecing the film's subtext together after the credits have rolled and the energy exuded has begun to die down. There is much being said in Free Fire about the ridiculousness of violence and the inevitable results from such ridiculousness, but, apart from this, the film is still an absolute joy of chaotic violence and cynical humour. A little bit disco, a little bit punk rock, just a dash of John Denver, but loaded with undeniably funky '70s cool, Free Fire is another sampling of Ben Wheatley as a filmmaker playing a unique beat on his own drum, and the results of his talent are endlessly rewarding."
" Terrible Movie
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,1,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is no plot.I turned it off after 40 minutes. I figured nothing else was going to happen since all they had been doing was shooting at each other in a warehouse for 30 minutes. Brie Larson following her Oscar-winning role in Room with this horrible movie was a big mistake. It definitely has Razzie potential.
" A Waste of Time and Talent
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,2,"A bunch of unlikable characters try to kill each other in an abandoned warehouse and the whole thing takes way too long. That is the movie in a nutshell. The dialogues sound like if Donald Trump tried to write the screenplay for a Tarantino movie. I would recommend it to anyone who is satisfied by the sound of bullets flying around and people swearing at each other, while wearing 70s garb. With a great cast that includes Cillian Murphy and Sharlto Copley, I expected much, much more from this movie."
" An hour and a half of gunfights, blood, and four-letter words with no substance or sense of coherency
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,4,"Free Fire is a profane, dark comedy that begs to be something interesting. But from the first twenty-minute mark to the end, it is clear that director Ben Wheatly is trying to capitalize on the elements of Quentin Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs', and the inspiration is quite evident. A group of people each with a criminal record meet in one place to make a dirty deal, and everything goes wrong when the exchange turns into verbal sparring, and verbal sparring turns into a bloodbath. Wheatly, following his tracks from 'The Kill List' and the marginally successful 'High-Rise', tries to keep things interesting with character spewing vulgar rants at each other and unloading their guns in a heated dispute. This probably would have been more pleasing if it had even a glimpse of originality flowing through its DNA. Unfortunately, it only amounts to an hour and a half of repetitive gunplay and morally depraved individuals burning the air with more than enough four- letter words to make Quentin Tarantino aroused. Haha! Nice Try! Set in 1978 Boston, this movie follows loose-end criminals Stevo (played by Sam Riley) and Bernie (played by Enzo Cilenti) who meet up with Irish Army Veterans Chris (played by Cillian Murphy) and Frank (played by Michael Smiley) to make an illegal arms deal. Joining along for the ride is Justine (played by Brie Larson), Vernon (played by Sharlto Copley), Harry (played by Jack Reynor), Martin (played by Babou Ceesay), Ord (played by Armie Hammer), and Gordon (played by Noah Taylor). The two groups meet up in an abandoned warehouse to finalize their deal. But when tensions suddenly arise, the deal escalates into a deadly shootout.What made Reservoir Dogs a cinematic spectacle was that Tarantino made the characters interesting, injecting them audacious, yet arousing dialogue and dark humor, while driving the story with a substance-fueled script. Ben Wheatley fails to accomplish any of these here. It is all twenty minutes of mediocre exposition before jumping into a long series of bloody gunfights that last for the remainder of the picture. What could have made this redundant fiasco more interesting is if Wheatley dedicated some time to construct the characters and polish them suitably dark humor. Sadly, each of them are left as simplistic figures with nothing to distinguish other than their foreign accents. From the moment tensions rise between these characters, the story gains its momentum by the characters engaging in firing their guns at each other and taking cover behind various objects in the warehouse. These following sequences are at least fun for a little while, but grow exhausting before the hour mark. And it definitely does no justice when these are choppily edited, spiraling into a guessing game of who's shooting at who. It is all just 90 minutes of guns shouting POW! POW! POW! POW! without an ounce of substance, buildup, or coherent storytelling. The performances by the cast, of course, are the redeeming qualities of the picture. Sharlto Copley, sporting a trippy 70s hairstyle, has a few nice lands at profane humor, but there isn't much to say about everyone else other than they are did the best they can with the small packages they are given to work with. Poor Brie Larson! An actress who just won on Oscar for Best Actress in her role in the critically adored 'Room' deserves something a little better than this. Free Fire is a disappointing dark comedic feed lack of originality, profitable characters, and a coherent plot to latch onto. While the film may earn the love and respect of moviegoers not thirsty for anything beyond redundant action sequences to push the adrenaline buttons, it is sadly a forgettable picture and fails to achieve the level of interest and wittiness it aims for."
" This is how we do it
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,10,"Don't get me wrong, with the general score you can see that this movie is dividing people. And this is obviously not for everyone. The cursing, the gun violence. Or just the plain fact that this plays out in one location. But there we also have the one great thing about it. This is the blueprint for everyone who thinks about doing a thriller/action movie playing in one location.Watch this on how to make it interesting, how to play out your characters and how to write dialog. You may not like things depicted or think anything good about the characters in the movie, but you can't fault the director of how he's doing, shooting, making this movie work. It's really amazing to be on this thrill ride, that once it starts, does not seem to stop. And it does not get boring for a second, with new ideas and some nice turns and twists along the way ... It may spoil other low budget movies for you, but don't let that stop you from watching it"
" Shoot em up fun that never gets dull or slows down.
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,7,"Free Fire is an action comedy film that plays itself safe with just a rom com shoot em up type of movie. It does not have much of a plot, which is just meant to have a simple set up and have these variety of characters be in an overlong gun fight. Director Ben Wheatley tries to have that 1980s direction feel from the tone of the movie to the costume design, hairstyle, and even the atmosphere makes it feel like it takes place in the past. The plot is fairly simple Chris (Cillian Murphy) is looking to buy guns. They meet up with an arms dealer that is represented by Ord (Armie Hammer) and Justine (Brie Larson). The weapons dealer Vernon (Sharlto Copley). They all meet up in a warehouse. Tension rises when Chris's associates clash with their associates over domestic abuse the previous night. When one argument leads to another, every one is shooting at each other. Being pinned down in the same spot for majority of the movie trying to make their way of escaping. Free Fire is fun, and has plenty of shoot em up fun with its stupid witty humor. Every character is written differently and they all have their moments of stupid fun. When they are all stuck with each other with plenty of ammo lying around. It is one long night of a gun shootout sequence. Even when a gunfight breaks out and one is in a slowly moving van with John Denver playing in the background. It's quirky and fun. But can be brutal with the violence if you do not mind seeing a blood bath of the aftermath. Sharlto Copley is hilarious and funny as the compulsive character about being above everyone and always afraid of getting his hands dirty. Armie Hammer has his moments as the tall brute but feeling lost on who's side he is on. Brie Larson is great as the eye rolling character and probably has the common sense out of them all. Cillian Murphy is great but has little to work with in the script. There is others like Jack Reynor, Sam Riley, and Noah Taylor who all did great. The gun shoot out sequences are more meant to played for laughs as everyone is having a conflict with somebody. Nevertheless, the film was never boring. For a movie that took its entire place in a warehouse and in a gun fight for an hour and a half was entertaining. My issue with the film is besides not having a plot or story. I felt like they could have done a better deal with doing more on the music score. For a film that is trying to be fun and have some classic tracks or jazz score. The music soundtrack was underwhelming in the movie. Overall, Free Fire is a fairly well action comedy film. A great cast ensemble that portrayed distinct characters. The humor and shoot out scenes were fun and brutal at times. The music score and plot were nonetheless forgettable and thin."
" A sad day for a Scorsese movie credit
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,3,"Where does one begin? - No actual story to the plot line - The fact that Martin Scorsese lent his name to this project - When no hand guns were allowed, everyone has a hand gun with enough munitions to fight ISIS in Mosul - The best things about the flick is a John Denver 8- Track tape and gunfire.No amount of sarcasm masked as humor can out run the mindlessness of this film project. In order to be funny, there has to be an honesty or truth that, sadly, this film misses."
" Super Perfected Stand off film!
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie is the perfected genre of a stand off! It had me on the edge of my seat the entire time and it's exactly what i wanted from the trailer! It's gritty and stylish and has awesome music and BEN WHEATLY DOES NOT DISAPPOINT AGAIN! Clearly he was trying for something different from his usual films here but he still nailed it. I hope their is a Free Fire 2 that would start immediately where this one ended! I've seen negative reviews of this film and i just don't understand where they could even come from! Yes it's violent, but not cartoonishly so, every bullet and impact is portrayed as realistic, horrifying and tortuously painful and yet his film still has some hilarious moments, some of the funniest lines are said in the background which shows how much awesomeness is packed into this movie. ALL IN ALL THIS MOVIE ROCKSUPDATE! my original review was written after my first viewing and i loved it then, but a few days went by and this movie STAYED on my mind so i rewatched it and i liked it even more! A rewatching really shows how crisp and well put together this movie really is, every piece of dialogue feels real yet contains little subtle bits of well crafted characterization or cleverly placed bits of needed info for the story. Also to all the reviews saying this is a reservoir dogs copy only worse i say to those critics, you obviously don't know film history at all then and are just trying to sound like they've seen one other film so they can compare it, reservoir dogs itself was a homage, remake of city on fire and QUENTIN Tarantino DIDN'T INVITE THE ONE SET STAND OFF FILM YOU FOOLS! but thats a tangent for a different time.Overall this movie had amazingly crafted characters, story and dialogue, amazing action and superb tension. And awesome music!!!!"
" Is that all you got?
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,2,That question goes to the writer(s). Really? That is the movie? The story line is people shooting at each other? Almost the entire movie? You got to be out of your mind to take to the screen something like that. There are tons of really good writers with stories waiting for someone with taste (and brains) to produce a movie and they choose this garbage? My god! Where is Hollywood going???
" I loved this movie
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,9,"I suspect that many people won't like this movie but I thought it was one of the best I have seen in a long time. It starts out with some amazing dialogue and some very funny and unique lines. It changes pace several times, throws in some twists and turns and as it gets darker the comedy starts to give way to human nature and reality of being shot and shot at in a close in situation. As some of us know getting shot at and shot is not funny at all but there is some dark humor that goes with that realm. If you took a civilian and put them amongst Marines in a fire fight they'd have a hard time understanding many of the comments being made. I felt like this movie while it dealt with a different subject matter did in fact capture that dark humor. Anyhow, it was different it isn't like anything I have seen before and it was refreshing to see that there was no cut and dry villain no stand out good guy either."
" Described as a Comedy
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,7,"Providing you suspend all logic, reason and foresight - adjudged on the level of comedic direction it's a masterpiece.

If you don't enjoy 'Roadrunner' cartoon comedy then, you won't understand this movie either."
" The Vidiot Reviews...
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,5,"Free FireThe key to conducting a successful arms deal is not loading any of the weapons before hand.Regretfully, the merchants in this action movie included ammo in the exchange.A Boston arbitrator (Brie Larson) gets embroiled in an arms deal between IRA members (Cillian Murphy, Sam Riley, Enzo Cilenti) and a South African supplier (Sharlto Copley) and his go- between (Armie Hammer) that results in a standoff.Trapped inside of a warehouse and armed to the teeth, each party attempts to oust the other and escape with the cash intended for the now botched transaction. Although it comes off as gritty 1970s throwback, this claustrophobic shootout misfires more than it hits. While the international cast is certainly capable, the plot, the dialogue and the characters are surprisingly weak and one-dimensional. Even the non-stop shootouts are too pedestrian to bother mentioning. Moreover, arms deals should take place somewhere public, like at a children's festival. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
" Great cast, Tarantino'ish style, which eventually makes it suck
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,4,"I've never been a fan of those ""violence at all costs"" Tarantino-movies. Especially the ones which are hard to follow.This is one of those movies. An arms deal goes downhill. Unfortunately, so does the movie.Most of the time I can judge a movie by how many names of the characters I remember. Despite the great cast and good acting (which is the reason for the 4 leftover stars to begin with), the plot is just horrible and I can only remember 'Justine', but just because she was the only female in the movie.Anyways. If you like watching people crawl in abandoned buildings while being unable to use a gun, this might be the right choice for you. And when I say 'unable', I MEAN unable. Not like a bad shot or anything. Like literally not able to hit anything in a 10-foot-radius, let alone further away.There's also dialog in the movie. But to be honest, none of that is relevant to the plot. They might as well just be yelling random stuff. It really doesn't matter.This could have been one of these useless overrated Tarantino flicks from the 90s. None of those were good films either, and neither is this one."
" I can't believe I watched this whole thing
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,4,"------COMPLETE MOVIE SPOILER---------Seriously, I can't believe I watched this whole thing. 90-minutes of a dozen or so idiots shooting at each other for 15 minutes and only hitting each other in the leg... despite being only a few yards away. Then an hour of shooting at each other and hitting absolutely nothing. Then the final 15 minutes where they somehow manage to all shoot each other with head shots, or other fatal shots.And I knew as soon as the last person standing appeared to be getting away with it all, the cops would show up.I'm absolutely awesome for managing to sit through this entire film. I give it 4 stars because the stupidity of it all was somewhat comical."
" annoying and repulsive
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,1,"A bunch of really annoying and repulsive characters meet to shoot each other in an empty building. To death. Only problem is it takes 90 very long minutes for them to die.Don't believe the hype, this film is a giant snooze fest devoid of any real highs. The ""jokes"" aren't funny. The characters you wish dead after spending a few initial minutes with their idiotic lines and annoying display of narcissism. The only thing funny here are the people that make you want to believe that this glorified turd is some kind of cult movie. Mindless shooting = cruise control for awesomeness? Yeah.... how about NO?"
" Really?

" Why is everyone so upset with this movie, it's great.
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,10,"So I will start this off with when, I first saw the poster for this movie is when I knew I really wanted to see it. I may have seen like 10 seconds of a trailer but I am that guy that doesn't like to watch to much of a trailer just enough to know if I should invest my time and see it. First off, the cast is amazing you have people from everywhere. Sharlto Copley (District 9 & Old Boy) Cillian Murphy (Peaky Blinders & Batman Begins) Brie Larson (Room & 21 Jump Street) Armie Hammer (Man From U.N.C.L.E. & Social Network) to name a few. And they all do great jobs, I didn't necessarily love Larson's character but still acted really well so I can't be upset or negative about that. I was intrigued to see how everyone unfolded and handled their situation as it escalates. Story was, I will say it out loud not the craziest plot line or an anything but that is what I walked in expecting. Its a arms deal that goes south really quick and everyone has to fight to survive. And that is exactly what the movie delivered, quick start that is interesting and then it goes right into the heat of the story. Some people say it was to comedy based and the dialogue wasn't the funniest and all that nonsense. I loved every second of that. It wasn't cheesy one-liners it's was solid jokes and stabs at other characters. Everyone knows it is hard to laugh alone rather than say in the theater or with your boys cracking a cold one. I saw this alone mid afternoon and honestly couldn't help but laughing at loud. It was like I was a part of the scenario with my buddies and that's exactly how we would crack jokes at each other. I have also read that it's like a Tarantino / Scorsese style type of plot line. One if it was them since they have a huge fan base more than half of the negative comments would be like my review and standing up for them saying things well you missed the message or that's how there movies are. But unfortunately since it was someone a little less known every became an internet warrior to try and bash it. Simply it wasn't your style of movie, there a lot of people that will like the style of 70's action comedy with a lot of guns and hilarious conversations.I know people will look at the 10 star review and think I am giving it a pity rating to deflect other people's reviews, you can view it like that but ultimately I truly loved it. in my eyes it was an hour and forty minutes of me being completely invested and laughing in my living room. So all in all hopefully if you see this you will definitely go out of your way to avoid all the internet kids shaming this, if you were interested at all and it looks like it would your type of movie definitely check it out. Great time while watching a fun movie."
" More blood on the floor than a sausage factory
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,9,"A gun deal is going down in what appears to be an abandoned umbrella factory in Boston. We are introduced to a bunch of colorful characters.They use CCR music to set us up for a routine film, but it is anything but that. The IRA wants M-16s, but what they have are AR-70s. A slight hiccup that they manage to work their way through. However two of the lower level muscles involved in the deal had unfortunately met the night before and was involved in an unforgivable incident. Once a bullet flies, there is no saying ""I'm sorry"" and going back.Title plot spoiler: Yes bullets fly in a free fire. In fact everyone gets shot in the arm or leg. It turned into a dark comedy with everyone trying to shot each other while crawling and hobbling around swearing about their wounds. At times the dialogue was Pythonesque"
" I'm telling you nothing about this film..
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,9,"I really recommend this film. I've watched all of Ben Wheatley's films (apart from 'High Rise', JG Ballard is not my bag), and they've all been really worth watching but definitely flawed (from my point of view as the viewer, I don't want to offend anyone by claiming my opinion is any more valid than anyone else's). 'Kill List' was a strange film that turned from '90s gangster film to '70s Hammer horror 3/4s of the way through; 'A Field in England' was exactly what I would imagine eating mushrooms in the middle of a civil war battle would end up like (and why would I never need to know that?); 'Sightseers' was like Joe Orton writing 'Carry on Camping' (it wasn't, but once I thought of that I had to share it). 'Free Fire' is just wonderful. I can't tell you about any of the references, or any of the plot, I REALLY don't want to spoil this film for you if you haven't read any of the other reviews of it. I'm not going to tell you it's a British version of any celebrated American director's oeuvre, but if you've seen Ben Wheatley's work before you can expect humour, and violence (and humorous violence). I think that this is the director's most rounded work so far, as a film it is really satisfying."
" Really disappointed
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,6,"I was really looking forward to this film because it has Sharlto Copley, Martin Scorsese as executive producer and it looked similar to reservoir dogs. How was this not good. The main reason was it felt empty, nothing had any consequence and the characters felt generic. I liked Sharlto Copley in this he did a pretty good job as did Cillian Murphy but everyone else was not good at all. Armie Hammer felt annoying all the way through and so did Brie Larson. Their characters just felt really unlikeable to me. Everyone else in this just felt cringey and worthless. The worst part of this movie though is there are no consequences at all. Everyone gets shot at least 5 times in this and they just keep crawling around on the ground. This takes away any tension as no one dies until the end really. I would recommend you don't watch this but instead just go and watch reservoir dogs."
" It could have been Good ..But its Awful
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,1,"MAN THIS IS BAD ..Starts off quite good until they get to the warehouse where it just falls apart ..If everyone who used a gun shot so bad as they do in this movie then nobody would ever be hit with a bullet..It almost makes it look like guns are not very accurate ..Even the two contracted snipers cant hit a barn door ..It makes it look like its fun to play with guns and nobody will get hit or killed ..But in reality its quite the opposite ..Guns are accurate bullets kill or hurt A lot ! I love violence and action in a movie but this just sucked ..a very poor mans attempt of reservoir dogs The only good thing is Charlto copleys character is a bit funny ,Otherwise if ten thousand bullets have been fired i think 3 people get hit ! Expected more from the likes of bree larson and Cillian murphy to sign up for this nonsense.Bad"
" Leaves no bullets behind
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,7,"2017's ""Free Fire"", directed by Ben Wheatley. Starring Cillian Murphy, Brie Larson, Armie Hammer, Sharlto Copley, Michael Smiley, Noah Taylor, Babou Ceesay, Sam Riley, and Enzo Cilenti, and Jack Reynor. A modern exercise in B movie genre filmmaking with B list actors, ""FF"" doesn't waste much time trying to reinvent the wheel. Based in Boston (with a lot of out of towners) during the 1970's, we see 1 gang, possibly connected to Irish terrorist group (lead by Cillian Murphy), there to buy automatic weapons. They meet up with another group (lead by Sharlton Copely), there to sell them the weapons. Initially, they meet outside on the docks, but like 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs"", spend the rest of the movie inside a warehouse. Despite the calming and battle hardened presence of Hammer as the dealers' security, grudges, crosses, and then double crosses, are made, and the deal quickly becomes anything but. Given the 1.1 settings in total throughout the movie, ""FF"" could have been a slog, but this is a slam bang thriller that knows what it is, and goes for it. Wheatley is proving himself to be a very distinctive director, with unique fare such as 2011's ""Kill List"" and 2015's ""High Rise"" also worth seeing. It's difficult not to label ""FF"" an update on the Tarantino rip offs so prevalent in the late 90's, but it offers a sarcastic freshness that quickly turns into a mélange full of rubble, dirt, and lead. Indeed, despite several characters such as Murphy, Smiley, Ceesay, and Larsen being level headed and professional, not a character escapes unscathed, as they all end up crawling around on the floor in pain, as allegiances and line of sight continually change. A reality show's nostalgic fever dream, ""FF"" empties it's chambers empty by the time the credits roll. 3.5/5For more thoughts on other movies, check out: http://animausimages.blogspot.ca/"
" Awful, just awful
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,2,"It was one of those movies, where an hour and a half seemed like at least 3,5 hours. It has absolutely no soul, just a bunch of shooting and pointless conversations. I wanted to stop watching, but I guess I was just hoping it can only get better. Well, that didn't' happen. I'm not saying the acting was bad, it was decent.. but the story was just predictable & extremely boring. I don't even know what this movie was trying to tell.. I know I wasted 90 precious minutes of my life, and I'm asking you.. don't do the same. My top 3 worst movies ever."
" An Awesome Shoot Em Up
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,8,"There is a point in the movie, which is also shown in the trailer, where Armie Hammer yells over some initial gun fire ""NOW WE'RE COOKIN'!!"" and that sums up this movie. Free Fire was a fantastic display of skill in how to utilize a small space to it's utmost value. It also boasted some great performances and a really awesome premise.Free Fire is about a gun deal that goes wrong due to a bunch of different personalities not trusting one another. That is really all the premise is, and as the first shots go of an everyone gets shot in one way or another, the movie just kicks into high gear and hilarity as you see everyone crawling around and screaming which is way way funnier than it sounds.I really want to stress the use of space in this film because I am a big fan of claustrophobic filming. The one thing I always go back to is the episode of Seinfeld where the group is waiting to sit down at the Chinese restaurant and the entire episode takes place in the waiting lobby. It really is a testament to the film makers to be able to use a small amount of space to tell a really great story. Free Fire takes place completely inside of a warehouse with just a few minutes taking place outside and on the second floor. It made the movie so exciting because again, and it isn't a spoiler, but everyone gets shot in some way or another so most of the movie is at ground level of the characters hiding behind pillars or crawling around in the dirt.I thought it was hilarious that so many of the people had these small guns and someone would get shot in the leg or arm and just get angry and fire back. It played a lot like a paint ball match and these characters all had different personalities and it was so cool to see them all interact.Free Fire is a fantastic movie to go see with anyone who is a fan of comedy or guns or Brie Larson. I highly recommend this one also as it is an A24 studio movie and in my opinion they always make creative movies and this one is no exception."
" Bullet ridden mini masterpiece
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,10,"How many shady, degenerate 70's era Boston lowlifes does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Doesn't matter, they're too busy shooting at each other, the lightbulbs and everything that moves in Ben Wheatley's Free Fire, the best film of the year so far. After an arms deal gone royally wrong, we get to spend a joyous, breezy hour and a half watching these halfwit scumbags blast each other to kingdom come in a not so abandoned warehouse, unfolding in real time and at a pace that has our pulses racing faster than the magazine clips can defecate shell casings. Wheatley's output hasn't been my cup of tea so far, but he's won me over with this lighthearted, ballistic mini-masterpiece. It's what I call a 'low concept high concept' flick, which I'm sure someone has said before, but suck it. A bunch of childish idiots in a roomful of heavy artillery, the bullets are bound to soon be flying as fast as the dry insults. The deal is simple: meet, sell a bunch of rifles to help the IRA cause, and be on their way. That's not to be the case though, for as soon as one of them recognizes another party's member from a violent scuffle prior, tensions mount until that first shot rings out. From there on in it's a 'childish game of paintball' (to quote a friend) that escalates into a deafening fire fight filled with acidic humour and John Denver music, a hilariously counterintuitive soundtrack choice. Armie Hammer is priceless as Ord, cool as a cucumber and constantly lighting up joints mid-gunplay. Sharlto Cooley chews scenery as Vern, the preening peacock of the group, Brie Larson kicks ass and takes names, Cillian Murphy underplays the IRA consort while Michael Smiley, the butt of the geriatric jokes, gets in everyone's face even before things go south. Patrick Bergin, Babou Ceesay, Noah Taylor, Enzo Cilenti and Jack Reynor also get their licks, but the performance of the film goes to Sam Riley, a criminally overlooked talent who's been laying somewhat low recently. His character Stevo is indirectly the reason for all this mayhem, and he's a walking disaster, the sleaziest little reprobate you can imagine. Riley plays him balls out and doesn't hold back, I really wish we saw more of him in films these days. All of these bozos positively ventilate each other with bullets, no one not sustaining at least two or three gunshot wounds somewhere on their body, and once the Reservoir Dogs esque conclusion rolls around, we know that few will be left standing. Clocking in at a rapid fire ninety minutes, this is surefire entertainment for not only action fans, but anyone who loves movies, it's a perfect example of the reason I go to the theatre. Cheerfully violent, casually profane and hysterically unapologetic. Just the way I like em'."
" Well that was a surprise.
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,8,"Really really enjoyed Free-fire.It's just the sort of flick i enjoy i suppose, i wasn't looking forward to it but it came over as a really watchable comedic thriller.""More blood than a slaughterhouse floor"".Some good twists, I do see the resemblance of Reservoir dogs but this is more upbeat enjoyable with some laugh out loud moments.Shame about the negative reviews but everyone to their own i suppose.Cheers"
" Absurdly funny
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,8,"Picture a kid's game of ""cowboys and Indians"" or ""cops and robbers"", and you have Free Fire. It is 90 minutes of non-stop ""bang-bang, your dead"" ...""no I'm not"", ""Ow! you got me!"" of the highest order. Forget about story arc, rhyme or reason. This is just one hilarious romp into what happens when a gun deal goes wrong, and there are plenty of said guns to go around. I get the feeling that Mr. Wheatley watched a paintball competition before embarking on this project. Saw it at TIFF, and will definitely add the DVD to my collection when it is released. It will come in hand for drinking games."
" Free Crawling
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,2,"That is what they should have called this film.Some action and a lot of crawling, like watching paint dry.I wanted to like it but it was just too ridiculous and tedious.No likable characters really, I wasted my time watching this and I urge you not to do the same.Shame really, with such a great cast and a good performance it still wasn't enough to save it."
" Boring beyond belief - One Scene Warehouse Shootout for 90 mins
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,1,"This has to be one of the most boring films ever made. apart from the first couple of minutes, the entire film is shot (excuse irony) inside an abandoned factory/warehouse, And everybody shoots at everybody. I am surprised that it lasted so long, but even more surprising is the number of exaggerated high score votes for this film, which looks like vote rigging to the extreme. My vote score of 1 is too high. I would have rated this a zero if that were an option"
" A movie for morons
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,3,"Reading all of the positive reviews, both critic and user, I'm left wondering if I saw a totally different film to everyone else. I'm a huge fan of the single-location movie - from ""Panic Room"" to ""Phone Booth"" to myriad others, I find it usually sparks the director's creativity, resulting more often than not in a cat-and-mouse thriller with more twists and turns than a Frank Gehry building.""Free Fire"" has no twists. No turns either. It doesn't even seem to have distinct scenes - rather, it's just one, long, meandering slew of cordite and crap one liners. Somehow the filmmakers have managed to take 70s kitsch, guns and beautiful Brie Larson, and made something less appealing than Zika. Surely what we want from a film like this, is a slick, ingenious plot, and a cast of interesting characters, with at least one we can root for. ""Free Fire"" offers none of these things - every character is vile and one dimensional, we don't care about anyone, and as the body count rises, my only reaction was one of relief at knowing I was one death closer to the credits."
" Direct-To-Video at best.
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,3,"Overall this is a very weak film thanks to the directing and lack of a storyline or even a script. I would not be surprised if you told me this film took two days to film and a week to edit, it is just that poorly done. Don't be fooled by the gun action in the trailer, the actors are literally crawling around on their hands and knees for the whole second half of the film. I wanted to like this movie, I really did. Most of the actors in this film are usually great. And the guy who directed this did Kill List, which is freaking brilliant so yeah.. I'm not sure how this film turned into a joke but sh!t happens I guess. Final score, skip it."
" An unbelievably boring display of gun violence and not much else
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,3,"When I first saw the trailer for this film a few months ago, I was very intrigued considering I am a fan of Brie Larson and the trailer actually made it look like a fun time. Not to mention I am a huge fan of A24 films.However, after finally seeing it, I can say that this movie is a snooze. If you enjoy watching a group of terrible people shooting at each other for an hour and a half without any depth or conclusion, then this is the movie for you.I wanted to like this film, but it honestly would have worked so much better as a short film. Watching people curse and shoot at each other for 90 minutes gets very boring and tedious after a while. Save your money on this one. I would only recommend this if you are a die-hard fan of shootout movies or if you're able to see it for free on the Internet.Otherwise, avoid at all costs!"
" The dumbest attempt of a film of all time!
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,1,"There is no spoiler alert here. There is nothing that can be spoiled more than the time I wasted to watch this lame excuse of a film! Truly one of the worst I have ever seen!We've all heard of a Mexican stand-off... this 90 minute waste was about an Idiot stand-off! This is rated Action-Comedy-Crime. No action, unless dragging your bullet riddled body from A to B to C back to A counts. Comedy? I didn't even smile let alone laugh unless having bad aim when you shoot is funny! Crime? The only crime was the making of this film and the fake positive reviews! At best, it's a wanna-be poor attempt at Reservoir Dogs. There's more plot holes than the bullets shot! For starters, everyone gets searched for guns, yet everyone has one. Then the endless amount of ammo that randomly appear for reloading is ridiculous. How many times does one get shot but keeps going? But the guy with his brains blown out is still alive?!? Then who's alliance is with who's, and why does it keep on changing? And of course the police show up right at the end after hundreds of rounds over the maybe 1-2 hour shoot-out smh.Stupid stupid stupid and a total waste of time! If you have someone you hate and want to get even with them, tell them to watch this but be patient and wait until the very end for the 'big finale' (of which clearly there isn't), and you just got even with them.I can't believe Brie Larson agreed to do this garbage nor that Scorsese attached his name to this.If I could give this a 0/10, I would!"
" Unfortunately
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,2,"I would give 2 out of 10, because during watching it I saw the really nice and specific humor. But in general the movie sorry to say but sucked ! Ms Larson is great, the actors are simply the best, but unfortunately even the good actors couldn't help. People were leaving the hall. There are no soundtracks in movie !I didn't like it, I have watched so many movies in my whole life and I have to admit this was the worst movie I've ever seen! Before this I was saying the same about Killer Joe by William Friedkin , but now.... well done guys, you're my number one !"
" British gang style comedy with a Tarantino flair
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,7,"My quick rating - 6,5/10. This was a very Tarantino-esque attempt depicting two gangs (mob style, not thug style) set in the 70s being holed up in a warehouse, and end up in a gun fight for survival. The entire movie takes place in the confined space, which lends to the atmosphere. At times, it seemed so cramped and I felt wondering how in the world they weren't actually getting shot (if you watch it, you'll see what I mean). The characters themselves also help in making the movie work since without giving a crap about them, this movie wouldn't have much going for it. The quality dialogue carry the movie moreso than the gunfights, since that is the focus. I am not surprised the USA audience didn't get much into this only because of the type of movie it is, and didn't say ""Quentin"" anywhere in it. Shame since it was pretty entertaining, and didn't drag itself out as well. Amusing and tongue in cheek humor compliment a strong effort that just misses the mark."
" Shoot'Em movie that isn't afraid to take its time!
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"This movie was an enjoyable action movie. Great cast, great set design, and above all else, a great script. You don't see to often a movie set in a single location, but what the movie makes up for in lack of set pieces is a stellar cast that can perform their own stunts when executed. It's a joy to watch something that hearkens back to the old style of action cinema (best example Quentin Tarantino/exploitation flicks of the 90's). I recommend this movie for it's simple and clever concept with some fun dialogue and gun fights. 8/10!"
" Charmless witless effort to capture some of that early Tarantino greatness
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,4,"A meeting in a deserted warehouse between two gangs turns into a shootout and a game of survival. Starring... quite a cool bunch of young-ish actors like Brie Larson, Cillian Murphy, Amie Hammer, Noah Taylor, Sam Riley. Too bad the movie can't match their potential. It only reminds us how boring indie crime comedies can be. Free Fire"" is a charmless witless effort to capture some of that pre-Madonna Guy Ritchie or early Tarantino greatness – only without the humor, sense of style, energy or anything to justify its existence, really. Co-screenwriter/director Ben Wheatley has managed to create little if any of the fun or adrenalin he surely surely must've been imagining while planning all this. There's literally almost nothing to feel excited about, no humor, snappy lines, stylish action scenes, nothing AND this surely must be one of the dullest gunplay movies in modern cinema history. Only the sound-effects of bullets hitting stuff are noteworthy. Even the plot is almost non-existent consisting mostly of some guys and this one woman yelling, cursing and shooting at each other, mostly lying or crawling on the floor and half-unable to move. There's little dialogue or spoken lines and everybody looks like having stepped out of vintage denim commercial or something, covered in sweat, dirt, and dust. Maybe because the events take place in 1978 Detroit. Free Fire"" must have been semi-interesting exercise for the cast and crew – how to make most events happen in one big room and without anybody moving much. But the result feels more like a bunch of deleted scenes than a proper movie. It doesn't get better in the end. Watch the trailer and you have had an experience much better than the movie itself."
" Scroll to the end to get the real reviews not the fake ones

" Tarantino, Ritchie, Woo, Scorsese, they're all here . . . with lots of guns
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,7,"By no means an ""important"" movie, but a good way to kill a Thursday afternoon in an empty theater. ""Free Fire"" makes no pretense at anything other than a sustained warehouse shootout intermixed with snatches of dialogue (snarky banter for the most part). Its cast of reprobates in gaudy '70s wear is really what makes this fun (in particular the foxy Brie Larson, and both Armie Hammer and Sharlto Copley providing yuks).I really did grow to like these people (some more so) and that helps when the whizzing bullets start to lose their appeal (I say that as an ardent admirer of cinematic gun-play); enough so that the loss of one character was a real disappointment. We never got to hear the John Denver story! 7/10"
" Public Service Announcement (general spoilers)
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,1,"I'm writing this review as a public service on behalf of Otologists. You may need one if you are unfortunate enough to see this. Just don't go! This movie has absolutely no redeeming or artistic value. It starts off with about 30 minutes of nonsensical dialogue followed by an hour of incessant and very loud eardrum busting gunfire in an abandoned warehouse with people just yards apart from one another. (Did I say incessant and loud? I want to make sure you get that.) Just a handful of people, yet each seemingly having 10,000 rounds, maybe more. They came only for a gun buying transaction but evidently brought enough personal ammunition to supply the U.S. Army 1st Infantry Division. They used more rounds than they were planning on buying. Out of the million or so shots fired, only a few found their mark with none being initially fatal. You could easier suspend belief in a Bugs Bunny cartoon shootout with Yosemite Sam than this farce. I should have left 30 minutes in because it only got worse and then you were insulted by having no payoff at the end. My ears are still ringing. Postscript: Incidentally, as I seated myself in the theater I realized I was the only in there. This is a megaplex 16 screen cinema. This showing was down a big hall, turning right at the end, then down the very end of that hall. If I didn't know the number screen I'd be out of luck because the management didn't even bother to list the movie title above the door. I should have taken all this as a bad harbinger and run to exchange my ticket for another movie, any movie."
" Average Velocity
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,6,"In 1970s Boston a contingent of IRA men schedule a meeting with arms sellers in a derelict factory only to become embroiled in an argument that finishes in a shoot-out One constantly thinks that director Ben Wheatley is on the brink of great things. With FREE FIRE you might have thought he'd hit the international target. Set in America ( Though amazingly it's shot in Brighton. England ) and classed as a blackly comical thriller in the style of Tarantino you'd have thought it might have done better at the box office but fails slightly on two levelsFirstly Tarantino is a brand name and unless your name is Quentin Tarantino it's a mistake with hindsight to emulate this style of film making because you're just going to slip in to parody. In fact even Tarantino parodies Quentin Tarantino these days with very mediocre results. You want to pitch a film ? Then please don't use the initials QT !!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!! Secondly there's very little story at all . I was very surprised as to how soon things kicked off. I was expecting an hour of insults and plot turns involving double cross and triple cross followed by lots of shooting. The reality is more than two thirds of the run time is taken up by the gun battle which intermittently stops for characters to throw insults at one another before reloading again. The fact that so many of the characters get shot multiple times and they continue to shout insults does become both boring too incredible to be taken seriously , so much so that's it's a surprise when anyone is shot dead That said FREE FIRE isn't really a film to take seriously . You might enjoy with a bag of pop corn and will probably enjoy it more round lads flats with a six pack which might explain why it has underperformed at the box office. One might have also expected more when one of the executive producers is Martin Scorsese"
" I'm sure it will become a cult classic!
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,10,"'FREE FIRE': Five Stars (Out of Five)The new British action-comedy flick from director Ben Wheatley; who also helmed 2011's 'KILL LIST' and 2016's 'HIGH-RISE'. It was written by Wheatley and Amy Jump; who also wrote 'HIGH-RISE' and co- wrote 'KILL LIST' (also with Wheatley). Brie Larson, Cillian Murphy, Sharlto Copley, Armie Hammer, Jack Reynor, Sam Riley, Michael Smiley and many others (including Patrick Bergen in a cameo appearance) star in the flick. The story revolves around two gangs that meet in an abandoned warehouse, in Boston in 1978, when a big shootout erupts between them. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans alike. I absolutely loved it!Two gangs, and an intermediate named Justine (Larson), meet at a Boston warehouse (in 1978). One gang is buying guns from the other, and even though the supplier brings the wrong guns, the deal seems to be going over smoothly. Then one gang member (Reynor) recognizes a rival gang member (Riley) as the guy who abused his cousin the night before. Tensions rise between the two men, and a shootout soon erupts between everyone. It then becomes every man (and woman) for him or herself, as a violent blood bath ensues.The movie is action-packed; it's also equal parts exhilarating (and quite violent) action, and hilarious comedy. It's full of great character development, and entertaining performances too; I'd have a really hard time picking my favorite (probably Copley though). The film feels a lot like a Tarantino flick (especially, specifically 'RESERVOIR DOGS') but it's more fun than that. Despite how fun, and funny, it all is though, it's also full of very brutal and bloody violence as well. I had a complete blast. It's a totally awesome genre flick, that I had heard nothing about until a week before it came out (so it totally snuck up on me). I'm sure it will become a cult classic, so you should see it in the theater while you still can! It's the type of movie that fans will be wanting to see on the big screen again 12 to 20 years from now (for the twelfth or twentieth time); and they'll be cheering, laughing and quoting their favorite lines from it the whole time.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/rLEEz_CHZwo"
" flat-lining, sparse action flop with no scene changes
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,5,"Nine people with terrible aim shoot at concrete without expressing emotion for 90 minutes. You might call this an arthaus gore shootout but with too much john Denver. Mind-numbingly boring cinematography and editing, and as far as I can tell the only lens they used was mid-century misogyny. Great cast, but bad enough to be a cult classic in 10 years maybe?"
" Like Res Dogs but worse
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,5,"Free Fire starts off well. Music is amazing and it gets you excited about the movie, and the dialogue works amazingly well. It's the perfect kind of dialogue. If you're an aspiring screenwriter it might make you think oh right, that's how you're supposed to do it. The beginning may feel a bit stretched out, but when s##t hit the fan, I almost started to miss that slow, dialogue-heavy beginning of the movie. Mostly because after that, most of the movie seemed more like just shooting without any kind of actual point to it. It desperately needs something more story driven there.The entirety reminds me of Reservoir Dogs, but like a weird, simpler version missing the charm Tarantino put in his work - apart from the dialogue of course. The set-up is good, but the story isn't close to as great as it could be. There's so much potential that seems to be wasted since it comes to the weird part where the film is mostly shooting and throwing in bits of great dialogue every here and there. It's hard to keep track of, especially when most of the characters look the same and the names are thrown in there so casually you barely remember three of them. Also the structure makes the movie feel way longer than it is. Free Fire has potential, but it needs some better way to wrap things up, and better way to keep the audience invested in the characters. This way it's just watching and wondering who's going down next and what the hell is even happening."
" Free Fire tries hard to replicate Tarantino, but dull dialogue makes the film misfire
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,4,"There's a lot of respect to give when someone decides to set the entirety of a story within one location. Some would argue that it prevents the world it's set in from establishing itself as big along with not much personality. A lot of that is made up with making the characters interesting with charisma and dialogue. Good examples of this have included My Dinner with Andre, which is all just one dinner, The Breakfast Club, which was set in a high school, and some Quentin Tarantino films like Reservoir Dogs and The Hateful Eight. What about the action genre? Oddly, I mostly associate most action in one-location stories to the horror genre. While we do have action movies like Die Hard and Dredd which were technically set in one location, they had a large scope didn't truly feel confined. Hateful Eight seemed more terrifying when there was only one room within the cabin where hiding wasn't really an option. Today's movie is not only set within a warehouse, but is full of trigger-happy people that are ready to aim. So can a shoot-em-up work when it's all in one place? Let's see if Free Fire can work. Sometime during the 1970's in Boston, a group of people are meeting in a warehouse to purchase several arms. Two guys, Stevo (played by Sam Riely) and Bernie (played by Enzo Cilenti) first come in an RV. They then meet up with two IRA members Chris (played by Cillian Murphy) and Frank (played by Michael Smiley). While waiting for a representative, Justine (played by Brie Larson) comes in to take up on the deal. Just as their getting to know each other, Ord (played by Armie Hammer) comes to bring them inside.It's here their buying some high-class weapons from a dealer Vernon (played by Sharlto Copley). Things go smoothly until one of the goons working for Vernon recognizes Stevo as the man who raped his cousin. Rather then apologize, Stevo instead insults him more leading the two fighting each other. It escalates into a bullet being fired at one of the parties. This makes everyone grab a weapon or two as the go to their corner and pretty much battle to the death or until police arrive. I have to give Free Fire a lot of credit for trying to emulate the Quentin Tarantino style with similar dirty dialogue, a nostalgia-fueled soundtrack, and an uncertainty of who will make it out alive. In fact, I was on board for the first twenty minutes before they start shooting when we get an idea of who everyone is. It's not to say that good banter couldn't have happened as they were shooting each other, but I was board the majority of the time. That has to do with the fact that neither the acting nor characters were that interesting. Sharlto Copley, Armie Hammer, and Cillian Murphy seemed to be the only ones I was invested in. Everyone else seemed very bland, including Brie Larson. This goes to show that you need a juicy script in order to make these situations work. The other thing I will comment on is the action, while is not spectacular, does allow for some inventive situations given their claustrophobic location. I thought about The Belko Experiment, which had a similar premise, but I remember that and it's costars more then I do for Free Fire. Along with a better script that took advantage of it's over-the- top scenario, it had memorable characters that you wanted to follow to the end. I expected Free Fire to be a lot funnier and for a movie that was produced by Martin Scorsese, I was let down.I'll give this four bad looking RVs out of ten. Free Fire has a great idea of a tense action comedy, but it fails to live up to the premise. Despite some good moments, they are not enough to recover from a botched execution. Free Fire is a misfire."

""Free Fire"" takes place in one location, where bullets do most of the talking, which is fine, I mean, that's why you're here aren't you? But thankfully ""Free Fire"" features a high powered cast starring Brie Larson, Cillian Murphy, Armie Hammer, Sharlto Copley, and Jack Reynor, who all with the exception of Larson (who looks like she could care less about being in this film) inject some personality and charisma into a film lacking much of or any of a story, surprisingly the biggest standout from this film is ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" star Sam Riley, who plays the film's drugged up scumbag character whose only here for the deal taking place because he's the stepson of Michael Smiley's character, who of course pretty much triggers the whole shebang. The film does suffer from a slow start but that's a given when you have to set up your crew of shady, machismo fueled characters. The movie gets by on how down you are with the film's simple concept, and how much you like these actors and their characters."
" Kinda flimsy for full length movie
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,5,"Free Fire takes place entirely in an abandoned warehouse during the 1970's. Members of the IRA, which include actor Cillian Murphy, are there to buy guns from dealers, which include intermediary Brie Larson, lead dealer Sharlto Copley, and his associate Armie Hammer.Already you can tell this crew of bosses and their really stupid associates is a powder keg just waiting for someone to go off half-cocked, which of course someone does for his own, albeit good, reason leading to a huge shoot-out stretched out into a feature length film. The problem with Free Fire is that nagging suspicion in the back of your mind most of these people can call this fight at any time and most don't need to be in it in the first place. There are 2 people who have a problem with each other, a lot of the others just seem to be brandishing guns and just doing a lot of dick wagging.Other than Brie Larson, who of course doesn't have one. She does have a Oscar however and she's been slumming ever since. Apparently the best roles she can get now are action movies where she gets to fire a weapon a couple times but other than just stand around the Kraft Foods table with whatever foreign co-star is next in line. There is some funny stuff here, courtesy of Copley, whose probably the best cartoon actor working today. Armie Hammer, this is an actor who always seems to have a stick up his ass no matter what film he's in. Sometimes it's funny, sometimes not. He gets a few funny lines here, nothing incredible. There's also Cillian Murphy who I kinda started to think may emerge as something of a rootable hero here but really no one ever is given that kind of development that you care whether they live or die and honestly why no one just doesn't call a detente on this just makes them seem like morons. There are some moments involving fire and exploding hydrogen that at least make the action scenes worth it but then there are these long stretches where people are just firing guns and bullets are landing anywhere but in a person's body and you're like Jesus, this is worse than a Steven Seagal film. He's so fat, why can't you hit him?Not only that but you can also barely tell who's shooting at who or what side some of the lesser known actors are even on. The whole movie just seems like it could work as a short film but stretch it this deep with motivations and characters this flimsy and it just becomes a bore. So 5 out of 10 guys."
" I was the only one in the cinema at the Thursday night preview screening.
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,4,"In 1970s Boston, an illegal arms deal goes from bad to worse, leaving a group of low lifes with guns drawn, for an hour long shootout in an abandoned warehouse. The problem with this seemingly never ending shootout, complete with guns which hold about 96 bullets, and characters who are shot multiple times, only to show no ill affects, is that it never looks real. The problem with an entire film peopled with one dimensional characters is that we don't care if they survive or not.The problem with the comic relief is that it isn't funny. Only about a half dozen lines made me laugh, and Armie Hammer is the only one to put in a memorable performance, with the remainder of the cast just simply * there *, occupying space.According to Boxofficemojo, this $10.000.000 budgeted film only took in a horrifying $994,430 from 1070 cinemas in its opening weekend, placing it at number 17 for its first week.

" Stylish Tarantino-reminding genre film
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,6,"""Free Fire"" (2016 release from the UK; 90 min.) brings the story of an arms deal gone wrong. As the movie opens, we see two guys in a van on their way to a meeting. When they get there (as they have John Denver's ""Annie's Song"" blasting away), we meet the rest of the characters: a group of Irish guys (probably connected to the IRA) eager to buy assault rifles, a middle man, a mysterious South African seller who's got the goods, and last but not least a woman whom we're not sure where exactly she fits in in all this. After initial back-and-forth banter and some unfortunate coincidences, everyone is getting increasingly jumpy, and it's not long before things get totally out of hand. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from British writer-director Bean Wheatley, best known for his black comedy ""Sightseers"" a few years ago (his wife Amy Jump co-wrote the script). This movie is a stylish genre exercise that easily reminds of Tarantino--think a more theatrical version of ""Reservoir Dogs"". I say ""theatrical"" in that, but for the film's first few minutes, the entire movie is set in the industrial warehouse that serves as the arms deal meeting place, and furthermore plays out in real time. In case the Tarantino reference didn't make it clear yet: there is a quasi non-stop stream of F bombs, not to mention the violence, so if either of that is an issue for you, please pick out another movie. There is plenty of snappy dialogue in the movie. Asks someone to the woman (played by Brie Larson): ""Are you FBI?"", to which she answers: ""No, I'm IIFM--In It For Me"", ha! The big surprise for me was Brie Larson, in another solid performance that is MILES away from her role in ""Room"" which would win her an Oscar. In fact, she filmed ""Free Fire"" right after filming ""Room"" but before ""Room"" was released, in other words when she was still relatively unknown, or at least under the radar screen. Last but certainly not least, there is a nice score, composed by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow, as well as some nice song placements (TWO songs from John Denver, among others). The original soundtrack is quite unique, in that half of the tracks are actual excerpts/snippets from the movie's dialogue.""Free Fire"" premiered last Fall at the London Film Festival, and finally opened in US theaters this past weekend. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at turned out to be a private screening: I was literally the only person in the theater (the movie generally underperformed at the box office). I can't see this playing very long in theaters, as it seems geared towards a niche crowd, let's call it the early Tarantino-era crowd. If you are in the mood for a stylish genre film with plenty of shooting and foul language, this will definitely be up your alley. Others probably want to tread carefully."
" Decent comedy, but nothing special about the action
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,6,"When a gun deal goes wrong, it leads to a comical shootout between tow sides that is both gruesome and funny to watch. Chris (Cillian Murphy) and Frank (Michael Smiley) want to buy guns for the IRA so he meets up with Justine (Brie Larson) who connects with Ord (Armie Hammer). Ord knows a strange South African dealer Vernon (Sharlto Copley) who brings the wrong type of guns, AR-17 instead of M-16s. Frank has brought along two junkies Bernie (Enzo Cilenti) and Stevo (Sam Riley) who had been in a fight the previous night and are high on smack. Vernon brought along an ex-Black Panther Martin (Babou Ceesay) who tries to calm him when things get heated. He also uses two men Harry (Jack Reynor) and Gordon (Noah Taylor) to carry the heavy guns. The clash arises when Harry recognizes Stevo from the night earlier. It is never clear what truly happened but Harry claims that Stevo cut his cousin's face when she refused to have oral sex with him. The argument escalates until Harry shoots Stevo and everyone draws a gun on everyone else. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
" The worst film I've seen in my entire life
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,1,"I've seen some stinkers - The Room, Manos: The Hands of Fate, Ryan Reynolds's Green Lantern - and they all pale before this movie.Rarely has such a capable, talented cast been wasted on a script this bad, with a director this bad. I'm not sure what they were paid, but I hope it was Jaws III level money, otherwise it's an utter embarrassment to otherwise good careers.Where to begin... An arms deal gone bad. That's a fantastic opening to work from, which many other films have taken and done well with - Lord of War, etc, etc.But this? This is just... Milquetoast pablum. People yell and shoot at each other for over an hour and nothing changes, nothing advances, no truths are uncovered. Other than the amazing potential for actors to sustain flesh wounds, and guns to have Hollywood-level magazine counts.There is little more to this than actors yelling and shooting. I wish there was, I do. And so will you, if you have the misfortune to see this steaming pile. But it's not bad enough to be funny, or campy enough for drunken laughs with friends. It's just... Bad.Don't see this film. Do anything else. Do your taxes. Sort your socks. Mop your floors, clean out your dryer lint trap. All of these things will provide you with more entertainment than this film could ever hope to."
" Hilarious Shoot Em Up!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,7,"I saw ""Free Fire"", starring Sharlto Copley-Hardcore Henry, District 9; Armie Hammer-Nocturnal Animals, The Lone Ranger_2013; Brie Larson- Kong:Skull Island, United States of Tara_tv and Cillian Murphy-In the Heart of the Sea, Inception.This is an over the top action comedy that I really enjoyed. It is heavy on the action and in fact, most of the movie is one big shoot out. It takes place in 1978 Boston, at a deserted warehouse-their clothes and hair styles match the era-where 2 teams are attempting to make a gun exchange. Sharlto and Armie are on the team that is bringing guns to sell to representatives of the IRA, which has Cillian and Brie on their team. Small things start going wrong-like the guns being the wrong type- and before you know it, people are at each other's throats-one guy recognizes a guy from the other team that he had gotten into a fight with the previous night. Guns are drawn and bullets start flying but the one good thing about it is that no one-and I do mean no one-is a good shot. People are shot in the arms, legs and other non vital areas but they continue shooting and crawling around on the floor, avoiding death as best they can. It gets to the point that they are shooting at anything that moves and I even remember hearing one person say, 'I forget, whose side am I on?' Now they do have casualties but it is all just drawn out for quite a while-One guy says, 'I need medical attention!' and another guy says, 'Oh, you will be OK for at least an hour or so before the infection sets in!' It is a hilarious shoot em up. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."
" Slightly above average, but boring, boring, boring
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,6,"I have never written a review on IMDb, but I decided to because I was so annoyed while watching this movie last night after reading the featured glowing user review.I don't need a fantastic action movie to make me happy. I just need a good movie. Drama, thriller, comedy, action, you name it: so long as it's good.This movie is only slightly above average. It failed to make me care about any of the characters, and I'd probably need two hands to count the number of times I sat in the theater thinking to myself ""pick up the pace!"", ""Hurry up!"", ""oh, they missed AGAIN?"", and ""WHEN is something going to HAPPEN?""I honestly went in quite excited for a quirky, norm-defying flick based around the interactions of several characters. You have a star- studded cast: Cilian Murphy, Brie Larson, Sharlto Copley; it will be DECENT at least, right?No. The characters have no depth. The actors play their characters well, but it doesn't feel like these are people that could actually exist. It just feels like you're looking at a drawing an artist put together of imaginary characters, who only exist on that paper. Most of the time the characters simply yell at each other from different positions in the room and then fire shots that fail to hit anything from their seemingly endless reserves of ammo. If they're gun dealers/criminals, why can't they shoot? Why do they fire with wild abandon instead of aiming?Even the setup for the situation is illogical, which is another thing that irritated me. No one can accomplish anything unless it serves the plot. Everyone can fire bullets everywhere BUT their target, until it serves the plot. It's exasperating.If you're a fan of movies which are paced far too slow, leave obvious logical holes in order to advance the plot, have exasperatingly stupid and drawn-out gunfights, and leave you feeling unfulfilled, irritated, and wondering why you wasted 90 minutes of your time when you could have been watching something better, this is the movie for you. If not, then avoid it."
" Free Fire Compensates For a Light Story With a Funny Cast and Some Tight Action
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Free Fire centres around an arms deal between 2 groups in an abandoned warehouse. The movie takes place in Boston, Massachusetts in 1978. The first group are led by Chris (Cillian Murphy) and they're involved with the IRA (Irish Republican Army). Also in the group are: Bernie (Enzo Cilenti), Stevo (Sam Riley), and Frank (Michael Smiley). The other group is led by Vernon (Sharlto Copley) and they're selling the guns. Joining Veron are: Martin (Babou Ceesay), Harry (Jack Reynor), and Gordon (Noah Taylor). There are a couple of extra people, Orn (Armie Hammer) and Justine (Brie Larson) have been hired as intermediaries.The mood at the warehouse is tense but both parties seem willing to do business. A couple of things delay the proceedings however. The first is that Vernon supplies the wrong model of assault rifle and Chris is initially upset. After some coaxing from Justine, he's willing to resume the deal. The bigger problem begins when the guns are being loaded. One member of each group had gotten in a bar fight the night previously and they hadn't recognized each other till this point. Tempers flare and cooler heads try to calm everyone down. After one of them pulls a gun and shoots the the other, the time for caution is over. All of them scramble for the nearest cover and begin trying to kill each other.Very few movies exclusively exist in the present. You can get flashbacks to the past to explain character motivations or move ahead to give the audience an idea of the stakes. Free Fire doesn't worry about stuff like that. It's not about what has happened (minus the bar fight) or what will happen. Its about these characters stuck in this warehouse and I appreciated how the movie operated in this enclosed environment. The trade off for this is that the story of Free Fire is limited. If you're looking for an excellently detailed plot, this isn't going to be your movie. Normally this would be a big negative but I think that this device worked for Free Fire.Free Fire's plot might be thin but the movie compensates by being really funny, delivering some well shot action and moving along at a quick pace so you want to know what's going to happen next. I was really surprised at how funny this movie was. Sure, the jokes are almost all one-liners but I was chuckling throughout. The characters are so overwhelmed with this situation that their reactions of fear and disbelief come across as natural. You also laugh at how these people are terrible shots. It was nice to see an action scene not exclusively participated in by marksmen. A lot of the hits come from ricochets (which you also don't normally see) and these people can't hit the broad side of a barn in particular scenes.Free Fire isn't really led by one person, the cast is fairly small overall but they all get screen time. My favourite performance came from Sharlto Copley. Vern is just so useless and you can't help but laugh at him failing to convince other people to do what he wants. Copley can be very funny in the right role and he was excellent here. Armie Hammer was also good. His character is the most comfortable with the conflict and Hammer has a nice balance between cool and funny. Hammer often gets a bad rap, he's pretty good normally but his problem is usually the projects he picks (The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is probably my favourite movie of his). I was kind of confused why Brie Larson signed on for this. She's a great actress and she's solid here but Justine is largely just one character of many. It just seemed like a role for a less celebrated actress to me. I also really like Cillian Murphy, he holds his accent well and he delivers typically decent work.I think your enjoyment of Free Fire will depend on your expectations from it. I definitely had some small issues with it. The biggest problem for me was how there wasn't much of an effort from the characters to leave the warehouse when things got too serious. They were too transfixed by the money (I also get that they're wounded so they can't just sprint for the exit) and I know if I were in this situation, after awhile I would trade being alive for being rich and dead. I also wasn't 100% happy with the ending. I actually liked the twist before the final detour a lot but they give the advantage to a character that had been absent for long stretches of the action. It just felt like one twist too many to me.I had to go on a hike just to get a chance to see this movie. I went for a drive with a friend and although we had differing opinions on the movie, I was still glad I'd made the trip to see this. Normally if you can keep me laughing and give me some interesting action set pieces, I'm pretty entertained. I definitely enjoyed this more than Ben Wheatley's last movie High-Rise and I think that was more due to the change of genre. This wasn't my favourite action movie of the year so far but it's unique enough and funny enough to make it worth a trip to the theatre."
" So the moral of the story is...Guns are Fun!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,7,"Free Fire has that nice hint of Martian Scorsese (Who Executive Produce it) that makes for a nice style of violence that blends great with comedy. At first I thought the film was made by Shane Black as it has the same style and feel as his last flick, The Nice Guys, but that just maybe the 1970s setting, both movies takes place.But this is 1970s United Kingdom, and Free Fire is about a group of gangsters about to make a gun deal when a wacky personal conflict turns it into an all out gun fight. It's a well done film. For about 90mins it's a group of people in an abandon warehouse. Lucky for me it's not one of those one room movies where everyone is talking, it's a really good action comedy with some good action, and when they do talk the dialog is really funny.A lot of that is thanks to the great cast of characters, played by some fine actors like Sharlto Copley, Brie Larson, Armie Hammer and Cillian Murphy to name the big guns, but the smaller names are really good too.My enjoyment rating on this film is really high. I found it a little disturbing as the whole film is about the causal gun play with some hilarious results but you can't help but to laugh.http://cinemagardens.com"
" nothing more or less than a kick-ass shoot-em-up movie with a highly entertaining cast
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,8,"I don't think Ben Wheatley had any grand gestures or even something major as far as making an ""artistic"" statement with Free Fire (except, of course, for his love of 70's and 90's crime movies - I make this distinction since it has the look and feel of the former, but the attitude and violence and dialog of the latter, specifically a Tarantino knock-off, but in the best possible sense, the spirit but that's all). That's a good thing I think: to simply aim to entertain as his goal, Wheatley does a fantastic job at making an violent, intense bottle film that, if it's about anything at all, it concerns what happens when rage and fear and simply anxious nerves get the better of otherwise 'professional' men. Oh, and did I mention it's violent? Yep, it certainly is!And yet, I should add, it's not as gratuitous as one might expect given Wheatley's pedigree as a provocateur of hardcore masculine cinema (see Kill List or A Field in England for a filmmaker who may have a lot of raw energy, and finds a way to make movies about men who act out on this energy). It's an 85 minute movie, and while more than two-thirds of the run-time are allotted for the shoot-out that happens between the rival sides (it's all about selling some guns between Sharlto Copley and Cillian Murphy - not even the right guns, of course, as it turns out, and then two of the hired thugs on each side realize they know each other and are out for blood), it doesn't get so repetitive as to become boring or tiresome.On the contrary, there's a fascination in that suspenseful way that reminded me in a way of that one memorable scene in Hitchcock's Torn Curtain: when you are trying to kill somebody, it's never as easy as the movies look, and there's a grim, sick but full-of-belly laughter to be had as the characters writhe around. That's the pervading image to take away from Free Fire: characters are often seen crawling along, sometimes ridden with bullets and other times only with a few but annoying grazes on their shoulders or arms, and it's like watching a comically hysterical battle scene going on, where people are huddled in this dingy warehouse (one of the great *locations* in modern movie history, full of dangers at every little step), and where surprises end up coming around here and there to heighten the tension.Did I mention that this is funny? The compliment that maybe Wheatley could take from being compared to Tarantino is that his movie is more of a comedy in a lot of ways than an action movie - it certainly is that crime movie genre of guys (and one woman, Brie Larson who shines as someone who can get shot and fight back just as well, if not tougher, than the guys) - and that's due to the script giving the actors much to work with, but it's also because of the actors and how quickly their wit plays off one another (surprisingly for me Copley hasn't been this game for a sleazy scumbag of a character in... a long while anyway). I think that audiences either find such scummy low- lifes amusing at the ends of their ropes, perhaps, just maybe, when the vulnerability of life or death (and how much they might care), or they don't; the violence helps I think, as it is heightened and exciting and, in the last fifteen minutes or so especially, it gets wilder and more graphic.Free Fire is unpretentious, compact, and kick-ass; it's surprising too to see something like A Field in England only a few months ago, which really *does* reach for ambitious and surreal ground, and then to go into this which is out to give its audience a good time. I don't know if all will take to it since it is so relentless, but those who look for it will see a filmmaker working out a solid pace for the shooting - high and lows and ebbs and flows - and that it's dominated more by the personalities as we grow to sort of like (if not care for) these f***ing bastards."
" Fun Movie, But Gets a 1/10 for Complete Plagiarism
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,1,"This is a complete rip off of Reservoir Dogs and for that, it gets a 1/10. Plagiarism is terrible and Ben Wheatley should be ashamed for it. The cast is great aside from Larson and her overrated eye popping and yelling crap. She is a terrible actress and her performance in Room was overrated. The film is horribly directed. Ben Wheatley uses so much shaky cam and most of the time you cannot even see who is shooting who. Sure, that may be a good thing considering that a free for all battle like that is chaotic and most of the time we won't know who is shooting who if we were in the situation. However, Free Fire didn't need 100% shaky cam to isolate the characters. Limiting to hand-held would limit the creativity of the camera work and it did. He should've used a crane to stylize his film better. The film is stylized like Guy Ritchie meets Quentin Tarantino. Wheatley manages to copycat Guy Ritchie and the plot of Reservoir Dogs. A double whammy for plagiarism."
" This just may be the definitive guilty pleasure movie.
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,7,"This review will be short, sweet and to the point, much like this film. Free Fire is probably the only film that you can call stupid and cool simultaneously and actually mean it. Sure, there are other films that you can do that with but usually those films tend to tip in favor of one or the other: stupid or cool. This is the first film that I can honestly say struck a perfect balance of stupid and cool. To me, that was the coolest part of the film. Truth is, no matter what I say about Free Fire, it isn't going to give you some revolutionary epiphany and make you want to see the film. What you see now is what you're going to get. If you liked the trailer and synopsis, go see it. You won't be disappointed. If you thought the trailer was stupid then don't bother. The beauty of this film is that it is superficial and those of you who can turn your brain off for a slender 85 minutes will most certainly enjoy this one."
" What we did for a laugh one Friday night...
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,1,"Another vanity project for Wheatley (""Field in England"" anybody?). Let's all have a few, dress up and make it up on the spot. Plot? Cinema doesn't always need one, particularly when you're IN. We can just knock this out and watch the critics snap it up. But if you're doing low- budget you need hunger to pull it off. It's all about hunger. ""Down Terrace"" was the work of a ravenous group. This is a fat and flatulent affair.( How I wish Tarantino would listen to someone outside of HIS inner circle). And worse - this is a thin-line to Guy Ritchie."
" A Stripped Down, Rip-Roaring Action Comedy
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"Good action is hard to come by these days. Not only because the pyrotechnics, stunt work, complex camera movements and the taxing physical toll on the actors is so extreme but because franchise filmmaking has made it so the genre has become one of expectation instead of creativity. We now expect buildings to explode, we now expect high-speed car chases, we now expect our heroes to subject themselves to increasingly difficult acrobatics for the sake of some nebulously described macguffin.Yet if we take away everything that has just been described, what are we left with? Well unless you're a new Fast and Furious (2001-Present) movie, you should still be left with decent characters, organically suspenseful moments and a plot that more or less makes sense.Such is the case with Free Fire, a film that needs none of that highfalutin' excess to give you your adrenaline fix. With its beyond simple setup - a gun deal goes bad between Boston gunrunners and the IRA; the movie tactically fills the screen with more than enough spent shells for popular audiences to enjoy. If your goal is to simply watch a movie and have a heck of a good time, Free Fire might just be your golden ticket.The film's bare-bones approach to its action is encrusted in the movie's very DNA. The action takes place entirely in the confines of a dingy, dirty harbor-side factory with little more than a couple of flickering lights proving men used to make a living here. We meet our myriad of characters and are quickly and smartly filled in on their motivations and larger roles within the group dynamic. The sequences of events that build towards the actual ""free fire"" are so simple, primordial almost pathetic in a way.The more fun it is for the audience to dissect I suppose. The busied flurry of bullets and characters writhing on the ground either in pain or looking for cover, works well against the constant antagonizing banter. There's a love triangle of sorts between IRA buyer Chris (Murphy), handler Justine (Larson) and dealer Vernon (Copley); a blood feud between rival henchmen Harry (Reynor) and Stevo (Riley), a pissing contest between the self-serious Frank (Smiley) and the quick-witted Ord (Hammer). And somewhere in the middle of it all, someone double-crosses everyone else by bringing additional snipers to the party.Smiley, Reynor, Riley, Cilenti and Taylor all have the thankless job infusing Free Fire with 70's-style legitimacy while being obvious support characters. Between them they bring to mind the easy-going coolness of The Getaway (1972) and the underworld fecklessness of Friends of Eddie Coyle (1973). I'd argue that they, along with milquetoast ""leads"" Brie Larson and Cillian Murphy sell the innate unbelievably of standouts Sharlto Copley and Armie Hammer both of whom chew the scenery to play out diametrically opposed versions of ""the last man standing."" Copley plays it cowardly but endearing - Hammer: cucumber cool, like Steve McQueen with a porn-star beard. It's a fun mix.Yet even with all these interesting and fun characters, Free Fire can't help but occasionally fumble - especially as bodies start to pile up. Extended periods of gun play and heads poking out to chant na-na-na-na-boo-boo, give way to characters struggling to move, stand or continue to shoot. People's eyesight begin to blur, their shooting becomes sloppier and those who survive til the third act eventually run out of ammo.To offset this, the movie wisely prods the characters towards one another with the introduction of additional cannon-fodder and alternative escape routes. Because the film is more-or-less Group A vs. Group B, we not only bare witness to creative plan-making but we get to laugh as each group struggles to maintain discipline within their ranks. The pot may not be stirred enough but we can all take heart that it's being stirred at all.To put it simply, Free Fire is a gas! It's a wildly entertaining action movie that purposely confounds expectations to bring you a stylish, popcorn-y pleaser with fun to spare. Let it be known that you don't need all the loud, dumb excess of recent blockbuster movies to make a good, solid shoot'em up. All you really need is an ensemble for great characters, snappy dialogue and a good setup. That and guns...lots and lots of guns."
" Bang and Zing!
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,7,"Greetings again from the darkness. Searching back through more than a decade of film reviews, I can confirm that the phrase ""slapstick shootout"" has not previously been part of my movie lexicon  which is a relief since it could never be more accurately placed than in description of this latest from the husband and wife filmmaking team of director Ben Wheatley and writer Amy Jump (prior works include High-Rise, Kill List and a few others). The zingers are plentiful – both in bullets and dialogue. It's unlikely you've ever laughed as much during such a violent/gory/graphic assault on the senses (especially auditory).Set in 1978 Boston, which allows for added humor via music, attire, hairstyles and vehicles, the basic premise is a meet-up for the deal between an IRA faction and a gun-dealer, with the brokers and ""muscle"" of each side along for the ride. When cases of AR70's are presented instead of the ordered M16's, the deal gets a bit shaky until cooler heads prevail. That is until one of the gun-runners recognizes an IRA guy as the one who disrespected his 17 year old cousin the night before. It's at this point that the film cranks to a frenzy that would make the Mayhem commercial guy proud. It's the visual definition of a cluster.A stand-off and shootout occurs (with side deals and betrayals) over the next hour and yet the early comical dialogue somehow becomes next level great despite bullets whizzing through a terrific setting in an abandoned umbrella warehouse. Unlike in some movies, these bullets inflict pain (and the subsequent cries and wails). The characters continue to banter and threaten one another, all while dragging their lead-induced injuries across the dusty floor between various forms of protective shields strewn about the warehouse.Normally I would concentrate on the major characters, but most everyone involved in the deal-gone-bad has at least a couple of memorable lines and moments. The gun-runners are led by Sharlto Copley as Vernon, a cocky, mouthy South African whose dialect sounds an awful like New Zealander Murray in the classic TV gem ""Flight of the Conchords"". In a movie that seems impossible to steal, Copley comes the closest and his Vernon would make a perfect Halloween costume and annoying party guest. His cohorts are Marion (Babou Cesay), Gordan (Noah Taylor, Max 2002) and Jack Reynor (Sing Street, 2016). The IRA group is led by uptight Chris (Cillian Murphy), Stevo (a hilarious Sam Riley, Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies), Frank (Michael Smiley) and Bernie (Enzo Cilenti). The two deal brokers are the ultra-debonair Ord (Armie Hammer) and the lone female Justine (Brie Larson). It's a terrific cast having a ridiculously good time with a creative and rollicking script.Know going in that the film is a very hard R-rating for violence, drug use (in the middle of the shootout), and a bounty of flowing F-words. It's neither for the faint of heart nor those who take their standoffs too seriously. Director Wheatley employs a vast array of unusual camera angles to ensure the action never looks boring, and his use of secondary and tertiary sound (especially with dialogue) is expert and dizzying at times. Don't expect too many layers or sub-plots. It's simply a shoot 'em up romp capitalizing on black comedy to the nth degree. John Denver might not have approved of the use of his song, and just remember, ""We can't all be nice girls""."
" What could go wrong?
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"Guns are hilarious. Especially when John Denver's joyful country pop hybrid is emanating sweetly from the van's 8-track. Yup, this is Quentin Tarantino territory, and director Ben Wheatley has done his homework.Filmed in glorious western-hued yellow-brown, ""Free Fire"" is a tense, late night gun deal gone wrong, pitting the itchy-fingered buyers against the itchy-fingered sellers, in a dusty warehouse shootout. As plots go, this is pretty pedantic. Sure there's a nice little twist here and there, but this film succeeds on the hilarious interaction of the many quirky characters.Folks gets shot, often several times, and treat their wounds as irritating inconveniences. Soon the warehouse is full of crawling, bitching wounded. Plenty of stars aside, this is Sharlto Copley's movie. As the slick polyester-suited, South-African accented arms salesman, Copley's cartoon character steals every scene. With Cillian Murphy, Brie Larson and Armie Hammer crowding the cast, that is no small feat.""Free Fire"" may not be game changing cinema, but it is a slap-sticky, wickedly clever, sensory hoot, and well worth your ninety minutes."
" Free Fire
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,5,"The trailer for this film made it look entertaining enough, and before seeing it I heard critics were describing it as ""the last 90 seconds of Reservoir Dogs stretched out to 90 minutes"", despite an average rating, I was willing to give it a chance, directed by Ben Wheatley (Kill List, Sightseers). Basically set in Boston in 1978, Stevo (Sam Riley) and Bernie (Enzo Cilenti) meet with Chris (Cillian Murphy) and Frank (Michael Smiley), two members of the IRA, outside an deserted warehouse, they wait there with intermediary Justine (Room's Brie Larson). Representive Ord (The Lone Ranger's Armie Hammer) leads them inside, the group is there to buy guns from arms dealer Vernon (District 9's Sharlto Copley) and his associates, Martin (Babou Ceesay), Harry (Jack Reynor) and Gordon (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Noah Taylor). There is tension between the two groups, and Vernon has supplied the wrong type of weapons, but the deal is done, the weapons are put in a van and the money handed over in a briefcase. The previous day Stevo was beaten up by the cousin of a woman he abused, he recognises Harry as the one who beat him up, he refuses to go near him, Frank becomes irritated, Harry eventually lashes out at Stevo, increasing tensions. Stevo seemingly apologises, but then boasts about what he did to Harry's cousin, Harry is infuriated and shoots Stevo in the shoulder, this causes both groups to split off and start to shoot each other. Martin is holding the briefcase until he is grazed in the head by a bullet, Vernon tries to coerce one of the men to get it as it lies in the open. Harry shoots Bernie in the back, he dies shortly after, soon two men with rifles outside the warehouse, Jimmy (Mark Monero) and Howie (Patrick Bergin), begin firing at the two groups, Jimmy is killed, and Howie is recognised by Ord. Howie reveals he was hired to kill everyone and take the money, but he is killed by Chris's group before he can reveal who hired him, Chris is defending Justine and requests Vernon's group let her go, but Gordon is intent on killing her. As the shooting continues, a telephone is heard ringing in one of the offices, Chris sends wounded Frank to try and call for backup, wounded Vernon goes after him, Justine manages to kill Gordon as he chases her to the warehouse entrance. Chris, Ord, Stevo and Harry engage in another shootout, Vernon traps and kills Frank as he is severely burned, Martin regains consciousness and starts shooting at his own group, Howie and Jimmy he reveals were working for him, he dies from his injuries just after grabbing the briefcase. Chris manages to get to the office, after getting past Ord and Harry, he kills Vernon and uses the phone to call his colleagues. The call is cut off by Ord, while Harry distracts Stevo, and Justine returns to the warehouse and grabs Jimmy's rifle, one of Chris's IRA associates, Leary (Tom Davis), enters the warehouse, but Harry kills him, takes the briefcase and attempts to escape in the van. Stevo fires at him, but Harry runs over Stevo, but not before he got a shot, a fire Frank caused spreads and activates the sprinklers, Ord and Chris are exhausted and out of bullets, they agree to stop fighting, take the money and await the inevitable arrival of the police. In the end, Justine shoots Ord in the head, Chris is ""accidentally"" shot being ""in the way"", Chris tells Justine that he regrets not knowing her better, and succumbs to his wounds, as Justine walks towards the warehouse entrance, the police lights are seen, she turns as the sirens become louder, she is trapped. The cast all do their parts fine, there is no real story, it is just simply an arms deal gone wrong, with a group of criminals getting into shootout and a game of survival, there is plenty of guns blazing and some violent moments, and it does make you giggle at the right moments, but it cannot keep up the momentum all the way through, an average but reasonable British action comedy. Worth watching!"
" fun, but confusing
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,6,"Brie Larson had a good couple of months four decades ago. Yeah, you read that right, but no, I'm not saying that the actress is actually much older than she looks. It's just that Larson followed up her Best Actress Oscar win for ""Room"" with two high-profile spring 2017 releases that placed her squarely in the 1970s. She starred as a tough journalist in ""Kong: Skull Island"", which takes place mainly in 1973 and hit U.S. theaters in March 2017. Barely a month later, we see her as a tough criminal in 1978 in the action comedy ""Free Fire"" (R, 1:30). But it's a short-lived cinematic time warp for Larson. As both of those films wow audiences, she's busy transitioning from tough 70s gal to superhero for her role as Captain Marvel in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (and its inevitable sequels). But I'm getting ahead of myself. This article is meant to review her turn as a liberated woman back in the disco era shooting it out with arms dealers.Larson stars as Justine, a young woman brokering a deal between arms dealers and representatives of the IRA. The cash for automatic weapons exchange is set to take place in a dilapidated abandoned warehouse. Justine waits outside with the customers, the tough but professional Chris and Frank (Cillian Murphy and Michael Smiley), plus Stevo and Bernie (Sam Riley and Enzo Cilenti), the two lowlife best friends helping out Chris and Frank. Enter the distinguished Ord (Armie Hammer) and his associates, the manic Vernon (Sharlto Copley), the quiet but intimidating Martin (Babou Ceesay, looking a bit like a young Bernie Mac), the volatile Harry (Jack Reynor) and the easily rattled Gordon (Noah Taylor).Inside the warehouse, it doesn't take long for things to get uncomfortable, then tense and then explode. For starters, none of the players seem to trust each other very much, nor do they treat anyone else with much respect. Some of the guys hit on Justine – and one of them comments that she has gained weight. When one case of the rifles is opened, Chris is upset that these are not the weapons he ordered and Vernon counters with an ultimatum. Chris tries out the rifle, reluctantly agrees to buy the guns anyway and hands over the cash in a black briefcase. But things really get hairy when Harry recognizes Stevo as the guy who cut his cousin's face with a bottle for refusing him a sexual favor. Stevo escalates the situation and someone fires the first shot which quickly becomes you guessed it – a complete free fire.Everyone dives for cover and starts shooting at the others, but circumstances quickly become even more complicated. Most of the shooters get a bullet or shrapnel in the leg or arm or shoulder (since clean head shots would have made this movie much shorter than it already is) and one panicked, confused participant shouts out in frustration, ""I don't know which team I'm on!"" Then, shots start coming from two snipers (Patrick Bergin and Mark Monero) perched high above the warehouse floor. Where are they? And who hired them? WHAT IS GOING ON?? Ummm and can anyone reach that ringing telephone upstairs and use it to call for backup? And who is that coming into the warehouse now?!? No spoilers here. To answer these questions (and find out who survives), you'll just have to see the film.""Free Fire"" is a bloody twisted good time but it's also fairly confusing. Once this shoot-'em-up really gets going, it's hard to keep track of where everyone is in the warehouse – and who's shooting at whom. There are only two ways to watch a movie like this: think really hard about what's happening or don't think about it at all. You decide. Better character development and more differences in the individuals' physical characteristics and personalities would have helped this movie, but the characters are still interesting enough to want to watch as you try to figure out what's going on. It's hard to decide which characters to root for (if any of them), but the humor and the plot twists keep things entertaining. Screenwriters Amy Jump and Ben Wheatley (who also directs and previously collaborated with Jump on 2015's ""High Rise"") evoke the spirit of Quentin Tarantino's 1992 cult classic ""Reservoir Dogs"". How does ""Free Fire"" measure up? You decide, but I'd say that it's worth your time and money to evaluate the movie for yourself – and you'll probably have fun doing it. ""B"""
" The Ambition More Than Pays Off
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Tonight I saw Free Fire, a 1970s-set action-comedy, and the latest film by Ben Wheatley, who writes and directs. The plot revolves around an exchange of weapons between a group of IRA members and an unpredictable international arms dealer, all taking place in a dilapidated warehouse in Boston.What can I say? Based on the early reviews, I'd heard good things, but had kept my expectations relatively low, just to be safe. And I'm glad I did, because I was blown away by the film. Before seeing Free Fire, I wasn't too familiar with Ben Wheatley and his films. I certainly knew he was fairly acclaimed by critics, but I'd only seen Kill List (which I thought was very good), and High-Rise (which I wasn't particularly fond of).But Free Fire, while altogether different from both those films, is also, I believe, far superior. Starring an ensemble cast, led by Brie Larson, Sharlto Copley, Armie Hammer and Cillian Murphy, it features solid performances from all involved, particularly Copley, who steals the show with a hilarious performance as Rhodesian arms dealer Vernon, who is extremely fond of his new suit, and has a tendency to refer to himself in the third-person.Larson is as good as ever as Justine, responsible for orchestrating the deal between the two parties, while Hammer oozes charisma as Ord, Vernon's hired muscle. Murphy is joined by Michael Smiley as Chris and Frank, the two IRA men, with Sam Riley and Enzo Cilenti as Steve and Bernie, their ""roadies"". On the opposing side are Jack Reynor as Harry, who has an entertaining, if childish, rivalry with Steve, and Babou Ceesay as Vernon's right-hand-man, Martin, who is revealed to have conspired with Justine to cross everyone and take the money for themselves. There's also the ever-reliable Noah Taylor as Gordon, though he becomes a bystander in the frantic action.After the first 20-30 minutes is devoted to developing each character, their relationships and agendas, things really kick off. And the action is bloody, brutal, and at times, hilarious on the point of slapstick. Justine is the only one to make it out alive for definite, although Chris' fate is left ambiguous, which is something I found refreshing; despite having a large and relatively well-known ensemble, Wheatley isn't afraid to kill off his big names, the majority of them in gloriously grisly ways (Copley and Riley are the standouts).The humour, the majority of which circulates around Vernon, is at times childish, but not in a way that it's unintelligent, simply that it's physical in it's execution. As previously stated, Copley's performance is the highlight, but everyone manages to invoke at least one laugh from the audience.One of the main draws towards Free Fire (for me at least) was the setting, with the entire film taking place inside the one warehouse and its adjoining rooms. Despite this, and the film's 90-minute run-time, the setting never becomes uninteresting, nor the action tedious or repetitive.So at this point, you're probably wondering why I haven't simply given the film a 10/10. The pitfalls are few and far between, but noticeable. Certain characters, such as Martin, Bernie and Gordon, fade into the background, to the point at which it's easy to forget whether they're still alive or not. The twist that Martin and Justine are working together, have hired a sniper to pick off both crews, and plan to escape together could have held some real weight to the story, but is glossed over fairly quickly, and not mentioned at all for the rest of the film.However, I was extremely impressed by Free Fire, and felt it excelled in almost all areas. All it needed was a little more development to some of it's lesser characters, and maybe a little more focus on it's central twist, and Free Fire really could be considered a classic. It blurred the line between action and comedy almost perfectly, and it surely won't be long before it develops a ""cult-following"". Top work by all involved. Top work indeed.Pros: Copley and Larson's performances. Supporting cast all entertaining. Humour was spot on for almost the entire film. Creatively brutal action.Cons: Under-developed supporting characters. Central twist not given the attention it needed."
" It is okay for what it is really
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,6,"""Free Fire"" is a French/British co-production in the English language from 2016, so still a very new movie. The director is Ben Wheatley and he also wrote the script with his longtime collaborator (and spouse) Amy Jump. At roughly 90 minutes, it is far from a long movie, but that's perfectly fine. I also believe if it had run for 10 more minutes or even more, then my rating would not have been at 3 stars out of 5. The cast includes several names that film buffs have certainly heard before, such as Armie Hammer, Sharlto Copley, Sam Riley, Cilian Murphy and recent Oscar winner Brie Larson who plays the only female character in the entire movie, if we don't count voice acting.So yeah, this is the story of two groups of people who are willing to do an arms deal. One has the money, the other has the arms. But conflict and antipathies arise quickly and the whole thing escalates when one gang member recognizes the other who beat up his sister the night before. From that moment on, it is really just guns being fire constantly from start to finish. I did not care too much for that, but it's not a negative deal-breaker either. The film lives through the witty dialogue and (non-shooting) interactions between the characters from start to finish. Especially Sharlto Copley once again confirms to me how amazing he is with the right material, a mix of drama and comedy in his case and he is easily the MVP in this film. The biggest problems I had with the movie were probably that for the first half and maybe a bit more it was unclear who belonged with who and who opposed who. Then again, int he film's weaker moments it felt just like everybody was shooting at everybody.Overall, I think I enjoyed the watch here. This is not a film to check out if you are really looking for something deep, but it's pretty fun to watch at 1.5 hours I guess. Martin Scorsese agrees. I am not sure if I like the ending with who lives eventually, don't think I do, but the final shot of the film was still pretty nice. And having seen other stuff by Wheatley there is no denying that he made films in the past that I enjoyed less than this fun ride we have here. It is obviously not a film that will receive a great deal of awards recognition, even if it has some already, but this doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It's just about the fun in here. Put in a dozen of heavily armed men with big guns and even bigger egos in a warehouse and wait what happens. You know the outcome. But this does not take away anything from the excitement. ""Free Fire"" is worth checking out. Go see it. Final praise here for the song used on several occasions and the contrast between that and the violence resulted in some of the most memorable moments."
" Watch and Vern
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,7,"In the late 1970's when people dressed like porn stars and John Denver was a big thing, two opposing groups are arriving to an abandoned warehouse somewhere in Boston in order to make a gun deal. Free Fire is directed by Ben Wheatley and tells the story of a gun deal gone wrong and the greedy, volatile people within the deal that find themselves in a stand off.The film's first act is intriguing, characters and their alliances are established fairly quickly, and the tension and humour of the deal was executed brilliantly. The deal itself is perhaps the highlight of the film as Wheatley and Jump's script, as well as Wheatley's direction perfectly sets up the tone of the film, which is blend of tension and humour. We watch in anticipation as we know things will go tits up, but we also laugh at Justine's eye rolls, Gordon's contrapuntal choice of music and Vernon's asshole personality etc. This film is a lot of fun.On the side of the Irish we have; Frank (Michael Smiley), Chris (Cillian Murphy), Stevo (Sam Riley) and Justine(?) (Brie Larson). And on the side of the American/ whatever Vernon is (half English, half South African) we have; Ord (Armie Hammer), Gordon (Noah Taylor), Harry (Jack Reynor), Vernon (Sharlto Copley) and Justine (as well?). We don't know much about the characters other than who they are loyal to, except for Justine who is a strong independent woman who is 'IIFM' (In It For Myself).The ensemble cast in this film was phenomenal with stand out performances from Brie Larson and Sam Riley. Larson's more-than-meets-the-eye character of Justine is great for the representation of women even if this does make the film whole film rather predictable. This film is a feminist text and Larson's performance wonderfully reflected this. Stevo is a completely unrecognisable role for Sam Riley and I found myself thinking ""I've seen this guy somewhere before... Is that Sam Riley?"" I was pretty blown away with this chameleonic performance.This is a gun-deal-gone-wrong movie, so once bullets start flying they don't stop flying till the credits roll. This was entertaining, but almost completely threw the stories set up right out the window. The films plot is still unravelled as the film continues but in a crazy and all over the place fashion, similar to the action of the shoot out. Although plot in effect takes a back seat to an enjoyably tense shoot out, the film does drags a bit as there is a lot of flesh wounds and a lot of crawling on the floor to the point that it becomes too repetitive.This being said, Free Fire is very reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, and director Ben Wheatley was inspired by video games such as; Minecraft and Counter Strike, so when the film has action moments, the characters use some very out the box thinking one could expect of these texts of inspiration. As previously mentioned, this film is a feminist text and although this is a good representation for women, it unfortunately makes this film rather predictable and thus the impact of some plot points is stripped away completely.With a strong cast and strong direction, Free Fire is an enjoyable genre film, but could have handled its story and plot better towards the films close. This all being said, the film is great fun, Ben Wheatley proves yet again that he is a great director to look out for, hell he got backing from Martin Scorsese for Christ sake. It's fair to say he's been doing something right."
" A movie with more than a whiff of cordite about it.
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,8,"As I write this, I'm really struggling to evaluate whether the latest film of Ben Wheatley (""High Rise"") is a masterpiece or just pulp trash. It's certainly a brave and highly distinctive venture, with that you can't argue.Set in Boston in 1978, an arms deal is going down in a deserted warehouse. Brokered by Justine (Brie Larson, ""Room"") an IRA team headed by Frank (Michael Smiley, ""The World's End"") with his business guy Chris (Cillian Murphy, ""Inception"", ""Batman Begins"") are on the buying side. As 'roadies' they've brought with them a couple of crack- head friends Stevo (Sam Riley, ""Brighton Rock"", ""Maleficent"") and Bernie (Enzo Cilenti, ""The Martian"") who are far from stable.On the selling side is South African dealer and ""international a-hole"" Vern (Sharlto Copley, ""Elysium""), his suave and wisecracking protector Ord (Arnie Hammer, ""The Man From Uncle"") and Vern's right hand man Martin (Babou Ceesay, ""Eye in the Sky""). What connects all of these individuals is that no-one likes or trusts anyone else.Unfortunately, one of Vern's van drivers is John Denver-lover Harry (the excellent Jack Treynor, ""Sing Street"") who has very recent personal history with Stevo. The fuse is lit, and when the two meet chaos ensues: in the words of Anchorman's Ron Burgundy, ""That escalated quickly""!And, for a 90 minute film, that's basically it. If you think after viewing the trailer ""there must be more to the film than this"".... you're wrong!However, what there is of it is enormously entertaining. Played ostensibly for laughs, with very very black humour and an F-word and a gunshot in every other sentence, some of the characters – notably those played by Sharlto Copley, Armie Hammer and Brie Larson – have some hilarious dialogue. The star turn for me though was Jack Treynor who was just so impressive as the 'lost at sea' brother in the delightful ""Sing Street"" and here delivers a stand-out performance as another brother on a mission... this time a mission of vengeance. You are waiting throughout the film for the inevitable showdown between Harry and Stevo - - and when it comes it is both bloody and memorable.A cracking 70' soundtrack, put together by the Portishead duo of Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury, involves 70's classics by Credence Clearwater Revival, John Denver and The Real Kids and it's hammered out at top volume over the action. The downside of this effect is that - for my old ears at least - it sometimes make some of the dialogue hard to follow.As a policing exercise, the film clearly has merit. In the same manner as Schwarzenegger's ""Running Man"" put criminals in an arena to cull them, so this must have reduced the crime rates in both Boston and Belfast no end! While some may not approve of the levels of violence on show, it is all done in a highly cartoonish way: like a ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoon, or ""Home Alone"", everyone seems to get shot multiple times and yet (in the main) is still active and mobile. All of this makes criticism of the performances something of a waste of time, but I would comment that some of the acting is of the ""over the top"" variety: surprisingly, I found some of Oscar winner Brie Larson's scenes falling into this category and snapping me out of the narrative at times.But overall, my evaluation is now done and I am rooting on the side of it being a brash and exhilarating minor masterpiece. Yes, it's one- dimensional. Yes, it is virtually impossible to feel any empathy with any of the characters, as they are all universally loathsome. But it's a movie whose flaws are forgivable based on the characterisation and the cracking good script by long-term collaborators Ben Wheatley and Amy Jump.Tight as it is within its 90 minute running time, I doubt you will be bored.(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com. Thanks)."
" It's beard oil.....
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,9,"In the late-1970's a woman brokers a dangerous arms deal in an abandoned warehouse in Boston. The buyers, two Irishmen arrange to buy weapons from a gang led by Vernon and Ord, but the exchange goes awry and thrusts all parties involved into a brutal struggle for survival.....Wheatley strikes again, in another wonderfully witty bizarre film that again proves that he is a genre of his own.On first look at the summary, you would think that this would just be another one of those crime films that were rife in the late nineties thanks to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.Remember the awful Hard Men, Going Off Big Time, and Love, Honour, and Obey? Didn't think so.In the hands of other writers, this could have just been that, but the writing has all the characters fleshed out, and it's so refreshing to see such an eclectic cast of characters get so much screen time and backstory.If you really think outside the box regarding the narrative, the film could be nothing more than someone telling a joke. There is a line from Brie Larson regarding what the warehouse setting once used to manufacture, and Smiley retorts 'whatever is was no one needed it anymore'.The punchline to that joke comes near the end of the actual film, so although many could class this as another warehouse heist film, Wheatley has written a script that begs you to pay attention to it.The cast are wonderful. Riley, who seemed to have gone of the radar for a while is brilliant as one of the reasons the trouble starts, but then in this situation, everyone has itchy trigger fingers as soon as Murphy realises the guns they are buying are not the ones they ordered.Each character is individual, from Reynor's unrecognisable bitter little guy, right to Noah Taylor's filthy henchman. It's so wonderful that each character is important and has so much to do in the film. There are some wonderfully funny set pieces, from a wandering character spouting out incoherent mumblings, to a scene when the two gangs sort of team up, and for a moment, Wheatley gives you the false sense of security that all will be okay.The final third is as gripping as it's funny, and there's one particular scene where you'll never listen to a certain piece of music in the same way again (The Good Doctor was spot on).It's short running time means the film doesn't really give you time to breath, it gets straight into the set up, and what a set up the film is.The Wheatley sheen is there throughout, and it has an awful sinister feel to it, because every one in that warehouse is vulnerable, and you have no idea where the bullets will fly.If this isn't in my top ten of the year, it's going to be a wonderful year."
" Banging!!!!
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,8,"Sometimes everyone needs a movie set almost entirely inside a deserted and derelict umbrella factory on the edge of town. With lots of guns. And crudely but fantastically drawn characters who tell a lot of the story without you really having to think about it. It's very well done, the music and the moves and the style and the look are all pitch perfect.From watching the trailer, I was concerned that this was going to be either some down at heels Reservoir Dogs sketch or even worse, a really hilarious pastiche of some blaxploitation movie. In the event, its actually a very cleverly put together piece, lots of good lines and knowing nods, as well as slapstick violence and terrific performances.It does what it does very well, no messing about, and it also does a bit more besides I reckon. Final shout out for the soundtrack, I did enjoy this, as did I some of the new and inventive ways to injure, maim and otherwise free fire into that were shown in some granular detail. And then a pumpkin moment to squeeze your head a bit more. Ouch."
" Original!
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,8,"No depth indeed, it's no philosophical à la Ingmar Bergman, nothing metaphorical à la Luis Bunuel, no fine deep psychological thriller either. It's just a good action movie. Only shootings. The whole film. And some dialogue among bullets. A little bit ""claustrophobic"" perhaps for some, because all the action takes place only inside a deserted warehouse. All the actors are very good. Sharlto Copley (from ""District 9"" and ""Hardcore Henry"") is distinguished in particular. I didn't liked ""the presence"" of John Denver in the soundtrack, I think that does not fit, it's from a completely different movie (a sad romantic love story). Instead, that organ music signed Ben Salisbury & Geoff Barrow is absolutely exceptional, it made me think of some spaghetti western soundtracks of the '60s, that Ennio Morricone's atmosphere. The same Ben Salisbury & Geoff Barrow who composed the cool soundtrack for ""Ex Machina"". Worth seeing!"
" To be avoided
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,1,This is the simplest real-time story set in one location with a one-dimensional (action) plot line and completely non-engaging characters who leave the viewer cold. Simple CAN work but this is neither stylish nor witty nor possessed of any other redeeming virtues. It is just a succession of loud noises that punctuate the boredom - and not very well at that.The dialogue is not easy to make out either but it's largely irrelevant anyway and I cannot imagine anything else that could rescue this from the bottom of the barrel where it belongs.
" Wheatly's most traditional effort is also his most successful, this is an entertaining and subversive film that's simple but effective.
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"The always polarising Ben Wheatly has never been one to conform, but here his most traditional work is also perhaps his most successful; he and long-time writing partner Amy Jump craft a tale of an arms deal gone wrong and the ensuing shoot-out that erupts. There's really not much else to it, the ninety-one minute feature takes place almost entirely inside a dingy warehouse with a few characters locked in a long-term gun battle. Thankfully, while the swift run-time does drag a little, the film always manages to hold your attention and is consistently entertaining. The set-up is simple but effective. A rag-tag group of would-be businessmen come to a meeting in an abandoned warehouse where another similarly disorganised gang await with the intention of selling them several assault rifles; the deal gets off to a frosty start straight away, but it doesn't take long before things go awry (not in the way I expected, might I add) and the bullets start flying. Once the inevitable first shot is fired, after a well-done first act that establishes the characters and tone whilst sewing several seeds of anticipatory tension, the feature kicks it up a notch with a simultaneously broadly chaotic and intimately low-key initial skirmish. After that, Wheatly wisely plays with the pace of the piece by purposefully peppering long stretches of perpetual pot-shots with powerful explosions of meaningful confrontation. He also includes a couple of small but significant side-steps to his own formula, which introduce life back into the situation whenever it threatens to become stale. It's a different kind of shootout, too, with less blood but perhaps more pain; it's not long before every character is unflatteringly crawling around the dirty floor, contorting their bodies to hide behind the various cover available, and almost everyone has at least one wound to contend with. The film clearly relishes its action cinema roots while trying its best to stray away from their conventions, and as such manages to constantly find a fine balance between a realistic grit and a genre charm. The characters can be lacking though, with only a couple of them actually feeling rounded. The majority just feel like extensions of the writers' own voices, occasionally spewing uncharacteristically calm and cruel barbs that are just as painful as the high velocity lead; the humour that stems from the characters themselves can be quite successful, but when the feature takes a step back and tries to force humour into a grim situation it can feel a tad artificial. The writing duo do enjoy their black comedy, but it's relatively rare here so when it does show up it can sometimes feels callous and out-of-place. Still, the fact that the feature is never afraid to be fun means that it's always a good time and never becomes dour. Since it takes up so much of the run-time, I'll now talk about the action. The gun-play seems to be mostly practical, leading it to feel tactile and tangible, and attention is paid to the amount of ammo used too. It's common for characters to reload their weapons or scramble for another clip, and even things like gun-jams occur. These moments never feel like plot devices, rather more like simple realities of actually using these weapons, and lend a believability to the piece that adds to the overall tension. Each bullet hits its target with true impact, sending dust and debris spewing everywhere, and characters are effected by every aspect of the environment which truly compounds them in the space. No-one has auto-aim enabled either, leading to characters missing crucial shots even when it'd be beneficial to the plot for them not to, which makes everyone seems human no matter their level of weapon expertise. Direction-wise, Wheatly makes good use of action-lines to minimise confusion and edits cleanly around the shots for maximum impact; the camera-work is mostly clean and controlled. Unfortunately, the infrequent moments of close-up action don't work nearly as well. The camera is way too close and shakes about too much, making it hard to discern what's happening. Luckily, these scenes aren't long and don't have too much impact on the larger plot but it would have been nice to see them handled with as much care as the gun-play. The actors all do a great job with their material, and the writing is generally very strong overall.In the end, Free Fire is a consistently entertaining film that does drag a little but manages to keep you engaged with its realistic edge and its genre charm; the writing is decent, the direction clean, the acting convincing and the action enjoyable. It may be Wheatly's most traditional effort, but it is also perhaps his most successful. 7/10"
" Ben Wheatley's Reservoir Dogs but with a British tone creating a very enjoyable 70s action comedy.
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,8,"Set in an abandoned warehouse in the 70s, two gangs meet for a gun deal, but when tensions rise and things go south, both groups start an all out gun war on each other until the last person standing. As well as a well executed action film, Free Fire is full of laughs and an non-stop fun ride to the ultimate Mexican standoff.For a full hour and half we watch these two groups of mixed race characters battle it out, from Sharlto Coplay' hilarious line delivering South African nostalgic suit wearer, to the very well fitted in solitary female lead Brie Larson as the mysterious nice girl. A brilliant mix and spectacular ensemble cast also featuring Armie Hammer, Cillian Murphey, Jack Reynor, and Michael Smiley, Weatley has brought together a brilliant iconic selection of cast members to work sensationally together as they fire bullets at each other. As well as masterful dialogue being dropped throughout the film, its the physical performance of every actor dragging themselves among the set that is impressive, the more bullets fired the more injuries the harder it gets to walk.What I would like to call a British Reservoir Dogs, Free Fire has the insane bloody violence that you may expect from a Tarantino film mixed with innocent humour, really taking the name of black comedy very strongly. The action and laughs never stop coming. What Weatley and his partner Amy Jump have very interestingly done is highlight the pain and injury that would be cause in your daily life that draws the audiences attention. While countless shells of lead are fired every second, when every now and then a character gets a splinter, its shock horror.While your absorbed in the constant loud gun violence, there's so much more cinematic work in the background. Laurie Rose's camera performance has a magnificent way of creating a grounded circumference of the single location and heightened at the level of the characters. Combined with the incredible put together gun shot noise, you really have a sense of being in the room with them and you have an intense atmosphere knowing and not knowing where they are shooting from. With a great soundtrack mainly consisting of John Denver's ""Annie's Song"" produces a remarkable lasting memory of the film.People looking for a fully developed film may not get this as Free Fire primarily focus on its slapstick traditional violent style with a very under developed story but that's not really the point.Free Fire is a great piece of comedy and action alike, with a magnificent ensemble performance contained in pure enjoyment and amusement. 8.3"
" Bunch of miss-fit buffoons get guns - What could possibly go wrong!
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,9,"This is a film about an arms deal that goes spectacularly wrong. Produced by Film4 & BFI - Executive produced by Martin Scorsese, (you'll probably know what to expect) - A very tense and gritty action drama, full of a violence and and dark humour. Set in Boston in the late '70's The premise is very simple but delivered very effectively, a prolonged and unrelenting close quarter gun battle develops between two groups of likable buffoons in an abandoned warehouse.Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Wise crack - wise crack - wise crack.Don't look for any deeper meaning, there really isn't one, but there doesn't really need to be any more than is delivered in a very Tarantino style. The first 30 minutes follows the set up for the deal and character development. The remaining 70+ minutes is the totally chaotic shoot-out. The atmosphere is further enhanced with copious dust, dirt, broken glass and blood soaked set.Bang, Ricochet, bang, Ricochet, bang, Ricochet, bang, Ricochet, bang. Wise crack - wise crack - wise crack.The film contains frequent but appropriate bad language, especially the use of the F-word. Probably as many 'F-bombs' as there are bullets interspersed with great comedy dialogue.Bullets, bang, Ricochet, bullets, bang, Ricochet, bullets, bang, Ricochet. Wise crack - wise crack - wise crack.I felt totally exhausted at the end, this is very different from the recent spate of remakes, prequels, sequels, superhero films. Highly recommended."
" Want to see a entertaining movie? See this
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,8,"I went into this movie with Mixed expectations. Mainly because of the high caliber of actors featured in it, Cillian Murphy been one of my favorites at the moment, Also because the trailer blew me away! it had me laughing out loud! Ben Wheatley is very hit and miss for me i liked sightseers thought Kill List was OK and i hated High-Rise, so as you can imagine i was unsure whether it was going to be as good the the trailer made it seem.This movie is fantastic, the shot composition, acting, lighting and most of all dialogue are perfect! It's hilarious and brutal at the same time, yes the movie is in one location but it never gets boring you are never wanting to see something different. Armie Hammer is great, Cillian Murphy is superb and Sharlto Copley is absolutely hilarious nearly every line he delivered had me and the people around me in stitches, for me he made the movie.Free Fire surpassed my exceptions and i can honestly say its one of the most entertaining films iv seen in years.8/10"

" And You Wonder Why I Find French Cinema The Best In The World.
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,5,"Free Fire opened today in the UKs Multiplexis and although I knew it was little more than 90 minutes of gratuitous and mindless violence with the F-word outnumbering the body-count roughly three-to-one I went anyway because it featured Brie Lawson who gives great Art-house and the reviews I read were favourable. Before the main feature started they showed approximately eight trailers and without exception they were all either 1) the same genre as Free Fire, i.e. violence in a gangster milieu or, 2) violence in a world of Superheroes or, 3) violence in space. To put it another way it looks like violence in one setting or another will be the only game in town for the next few weeks. Were I in Paris (where I will be at Easter)I would be offered alternate fare; yes, there will still be the mindless Hollywood pap showing at the larger salles but this will be offset by 'ordinary' movies such as rom-coms, out-and-out comedies and films addressing the Human Condition where PEOPLE still count more than cgi and/or sequels. Yes, the French do make what they call Polars/Policiers, and they do feature violence but they are only a small percentage of the films made in France every year. They even have a pathetic actor who specialises in and has a large following in the gratuitous violence genre; he is the son of a distinguished actor whose name he has dragged through the gutter, his name is Vincent Cassell and he is a graduate of the Martin Scorcese/Robert de Niro School of Acting, motto: We Can't Teach You To Act But We Can Teach You To Scream And Simulate Psychotic Behaviour. The good thing is there is only one of him in France whereas in Hollywood there are a half a dozen on every street corner. Dennis Hopper has a lot to answer for. Meanwhile back at this drek. Brie Larson meant it wasn't a total loss but that's the best you can give it."
" An absolute blast from start to finish.
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,9,"Free Fire is an absolute laugh riot from start to finish and some of the most fun I've had at the cinema in... ever. The pace is established from the get go as once we are introduced to the characters things goes haywire almost immediately. As the film continues some character motivations are made clearer which may lead one to question who's side anyone is actually on, as it turns out, they're all in it for themselves. Whereas some are left in the dark to let the audience ponder at their own freewill. Shooting starts due to past events that resurface after two gang members come face to face leaving a road of destruction in their wake.Featuring some of the best sound design I've heard so far this year Wheatley gives his audience a sense of space within the confined environment in which I feel he purposely neglects in his visual representations. The action on screen is messy and convoluted to a point that fits the narrative of what comes to be every man for himself. It's impossible to determine who is where and therefore who's side anybody is actually on. At first I found this to be a problem when watching but giving it some afterthought I came to realise what Ben was aiming for. Using direction of sound to determine each players position on the board. It's quite an ambitious directing choice but I believe Wheatley more than pays off.I've had this argument among friends and those I converse with in Facebook groups and it's about how you don't need your characters to be richly detailed and well developed to make them interesting or memorable. The film in question was Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The argument which was presented to me is that of - you know they're all going to die anyway so spending time developing characters would hurt the pace of the film. It's a film used to bridge the gaps between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope. And that's fine but the writing still has to be good enough to make those characters stand out regardless of their outcome. This is a film that understands this completely and something Ben Wheatley and wife/co-writer Amy Jump seem to have the most control in.I've had my reservations about Armie Hammer for while but Free Fire once again goes to show that anyone can give a good performance when they have the right script behind them. By far the strongest element to this film is the chemistry all of our actors have and the distinct personality each and every person uniquely has, Sharlto Copley, Jack Reynor, and Sam Riley especially and the pairing of Armie and Michael Smiley make for some quite hilarious back and forth one liners. Having such life in their performances and such fluidity in the screenplay is what make so congenial. Marvel could learn a thing or two when it comes to using jokes in your action scenes.In the end, Free Fire is a thrilling, hilarious, action packed ball of insanity that is not without it's flaws, mostly with Brie Larson's character as I feel she was kind of sidelined without much to do, she was certainly left too much in the shadows, I would have liked to see more of her. Of course the moments she had on screen were definitely benefiting. But my willingness to look past them as they're not too major is my sheer enjoyment of the movies denouement which had me smiling from ear to ear so much that my jaw started hurting. So far the only Ben Wheatley film that I've actually enjoyed, I hope he can keep a hot streak alive."
" Fun action comedy peppered with hilarious characters and plenty of quips
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,8,"Ben Wheatley certainly has a twisted sense of humour, evident in films such as Sightseers and High-Rise, and he brings it to proceedings once again in Free Fire, a relentlessly entertaining action comedy. Featuring an impressive ensemble cast, Free Fire was a film that had been on my radar for a while.Boston, 1978, and two gangs set a meeting in an abandoned warehouse for an arms deal. It doesn't all exactly go to plan and it's not long before a full on shootout between the two gangs occurs, leading to bullets flying all over the place and a game of survival for everyone involved.Free Fire wastes no time in getting into things and when the entire cast are together, the film really does fire on all cylinders. Ben Wheatley's film is by no means the best film I'll ever see but it is the perfect choice for an entertaining time at the cinema, making sure it doesn't overstay its welcome with a swift ninety minute runtime.Wheatley collaborates once again with Amy Jump to write the film and the result is a quick screenplay that delivers plenty of wit and humour, as well as a shootout that the films builds itself around, which becomes farcical due to the sheer amount of incompetent characters the film plays host to. A screenplay like this deserves a cast to do it justice and Free Fire has exactly that in the shape of an ensemble cast to get excited about. Cillian Murphy has one of the more prominent roles and he manages to bring the coldness we are so used to seeing from him to the role of Chris. Brie Larson gives the film its singular female character and she's certainly no pushover, Larson playing Justine with a sense of grit and superior intellect over her male counterparts. Then there is Armie Hammer, who shines as the overly sarcastic and suave Ord.The man who steals the film from everyone else though is Sharlto Copley as Vernon, an arms dealer who runs his mouth a little too much. Sure, his South African accent makes him sound funnier but there is no doubt that Copley's Vernon gets the majority of the film's quips., and he absolutely revels in them. There's some fine support from Jack Reynor and Sam Riley on show too as a couple of warring members from their respective gangs.For a fun night at the cinema, I can't recommend Free Fire enough. If you're someone who is easily offended by foul language or doesn't like loud noises though, I feel as if you'd take an instant dislike to this film, which would certainly be your loss."
" A wonderful example of a guilty pleasure movie
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,8,"I watched this at a Cineworld Unlimited showing. Before it played, there was a little intro from Ben Wheatley the director. He described the movie as a fun action film, with lots of violence and lots of swearing, and that it was mercifully short. I'm not sure I can characterise it much better than that. So I'm not going to try.When I saw the trailers for this film, I turned to my wife and said ""I really hope this whole film is contained in the one room, if they do that, then it will have to stand and fall on the script, the characters and the acting, rather than just rely on some special effects and the action"". I am pleased to report, I got my wish.The setup is simple. We're in 1978, a group of Irish men (presumably IRA) are trying to buy guns in American, Boston to be precise, so they ship them back to Ireland, and use them to shoot the British. The 'brains' of the outfit are Chris and Frank played by Cillian Murphy and Michael Smiley respectively. The (and I'm using this next word in the loosest possible way) 'muscle' (but in all fairness, they certainly don't seem to have any brains) are Stevo and Bernie.On the other side, we have the sellers, headed up by Vern, played by Sharlto Copley, and Ord played by Armie Hammer.Both parties seem to have been brought together by the only woman in the film, Justine played by Brie Larson.So, we have a briefcase full of cash, and a van full of guns, all we have to do is swap one for the other. What could go wrong?Let's just say that there is a disagreement over someone's actions, and things quickly spiral out of control.I'm not going to get into details, because to be honest, there aren't very many, and if you've read any of my other reviews I don't like to spoil. We can just say that bullets start flying, left, right and centre, and we have a film.The films hangs on the humour of the situation. The one liners, the insanely inappropriate comments, the wonderful character interactions.The exchanges between Frank and Ord are wonderful.Vern is hilarious, and his reactions to Chris chatting up Justine are a great running joke. It really will make you giggle, often at things you'd wish didn't make you laugh. Watching people get shot shouldn't be funny, but in this context, it just is.This is the ultimate Mexican standoff. Luckily none of the characters have a particularly good aim, so the ridiculousness lasts exactly 90 minutes, and that feels just about right. There is only so much chaos, bursts of gunfire interlinked with witty banter that an audience can take.This isn't a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a wonderful example of a guilty pleasure movie. Lots of action, lots of jokes, and a little more intrigue then you originally expect. Oh, didn't I say it doesn't play out quite as simply as you'd assume? No? Well it doesn't, it actually keeps you on your toes, that is when you're not rolling around on the floor.Remember to listen carefully, because some of the best jokes come in the middle of gunshots, or are said in a ridiculously over the top South African accent.Well worth 90 minutes of anyone's time."
" Free Fire is lightning in a bloody bottle
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,10,"A barrage of bullets and one liners, Free Fire is another success in Ben Wheatley's growing filmography of brilliant films yet, even with the quality of his previous works, this tale of a gun trade gone wrong may just be my favourite: bringing wit, gore and a tighter pace than any film this year.Wheatley has created a bottle style narrative to focus on a small cast of extremely compelling characters; brought to life by an equally compelling cast of both Hollywood and British talent, signalling the continuing move of Wheatley into popular cinema with stars like Brie Larson and Armie Hammer. Both give terrific performances as do the rest of the cast but it is the less know talent of Michael Smiley and Sam Riley that give the two strongest performances in my opinion. Wheatley master the two poles of violence and comedy masterfully, weaving together hilarious dialogue (thanks to Wheatley and Amy Jumps strong script) and some of the most brutal action I've seen in a while. Despite the endless onslaught of gunfire, each bullet is given significance and impact with pitch perfect sound design and realistic, gory injuries. Another strong element is the 70s setting, a personal appeal of mine due to the aesthetics and music of the time; both brought to life on screen in great detail.While the relentless thrills of the film are constantly escalating and keeping you engaged, the climax itself is unfortunately almost anti climatic, unable to capitalise on the preceding action set pieces and leaving you on a very sudden, ambiguous final shot. Despite this, the characters keep the story constantly fresh, each bringing their own motivations and personality to the chaotic meeting in that fateful warehouse. Even with the escalating violence of the situation, they all remain fun and the witty rapport between each of them never stops, especially with Sharlto Copleys childish leader Vern, who gets some of the films best lines. The compression of the action into almost real time keeps everything tight and relentlessly compelling from start to end with every action registering as a vital moment in the bigger, bloodier picture.Free Fire is a violent yet hilarious thriller that shows how action on a small scale can have so much more impact than a worldwide epic. Hopefully Wheatley continues to expand his filmography and further perfect the merging of British Charm and American talent.SWEETVisit https://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/ for more."
" If this film doesn't become one of those movies that is quoted by everyone, I will be majorly surprised!
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely loved this movie, from the witty dialogue to the very inventive action sequences to the superb cast performances, what's not to love? I got to see this film at a special pre-screening which was followed by a Q&A session with the director himself Ben Wheatley, and you could just see how passionate he felt about this project. He's still one of the only directors who demands to have as much control over a film's production as possible without a studio's interference.And Wheatley delivers to the full here. As he himself said along the lines of that the movie is pretty much 90 minutes of swearing, gun showdowns, profanity, violence, provocative imagery etc. etc. And yes, that is pretty much it. But somehow, it works! And it doesn't hurt that this film has an executive producer who is this little known fella named Martin Scorsese. Also, Sharlto Copley in this film - steals the show. That's all I'll say, he steals the show."
" Guns - lots of guns.
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,8,"""Free Fire"" is the latest effort from UK renegade director, Ben Wheatley, following his - to be frank – masterwork, High-Rise, from 2016. Free Fire follows two different groups (one lead by Cillian Murphy, the other by an electric Sharlto Copley) as they trade cash for guns. Things of course go awry and flies jump in to the ointment with frequent regularity. I saw this with a special Q and A with Wheatley, and he told us that over the course of filming they had fired 6000 rounds of ammunition in total. It shows: Free Fire isn't going for class. It's grimy, it's dusty, it's caked in rubble and the soundtrack, occasionally - in between all the gunfire - actually has some music in it. At its best, Free Fire feels like a silent movie: It's slapstick before and after artillery. It's a real treat in the way that at no point does it really let up. It's a constant. It's a sugar rush for grown ups. This doesn't feel like a film you can pause and go and make a phone call in between. Once you've started, you strap in and you finish it. The one place setting brings up obvious similarities with Reservoir Dogs – which does bring me to the lack of characterisation in Free Fire; Tarantino somehow managed to make us feel for a bunch of colours. Wheatley, however has left it gapingly open. Backstory obviously isn't what the director was going for here, but we'd certainly feel the wounds more so if we knew a little history about these nuts – with that said, maybe a better comparison would be to John Carpenter's The Thing Overall, Free Fire will be like nothing else you see this year (ooh, and the last shot of the film is an utter treat), so go and see it before Ben Wheatley is offered some ma-hoossive Sci-Fi budget by Fox or even Disney. @JonnyJonJon1"
