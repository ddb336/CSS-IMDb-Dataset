" the impossible homecoming
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,9,"'Phoenix' made by Christian Petzold in 2014 is a seemingly simple film, telling almost linearly a story with only three main characters, but which contains a complexity of ideas and emotions that characterizes only films or literary works of high quality. After watching the film I read some reviews and opinions of the viewers on IMDB, almost everyone interpreted differently what we had all seen on the screen, and my personal interpretation is also different from theirs. 'Phoenix' is, I believe, a proof that the subject of the Holocaust is not exhausted in the art of film, that there are still significant aspects and points of view that have not been explored. It is also one of the few films (or books, or other works of art) that explore the complex and explosive theme of the relationship between the German Jews who survived the Holocaust and the country they considered homeland and which during the Nazi period turned for them into a infernal extermination machine.The story in the film takes place in 1945, shortly after the end of the war. Nelly Lenz (Nina Hoss) and Lene Winter (Nina Kunzendorf), survivors of the hell of the extermination camps, return to Germany. It is the story of an impossible homecoming, to a home that no longer exists. Nelly is completely disfigured and the reparatory surgery she undergoes transforms her to the point that she is no longer recognisable even by her husband Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld). Is this the true reason? Their reunion is strange. Nelly would like to return to her former life, but this is no longer possible. Johnny seems convinced that Nelly is dead, but he wants to use the woman who looks like Nelly to get her fortune. Nelly decides to play the role of the stranger disguised as herself. A false identity that masks itself in the real identity. But what was left of her identity after the sufferings she had gone through? None of those around seem to be interested in what had happened in the death camps and they express no responsible for the fate of the survivors. Is the return still possible? The relationship between Nelly and Johnny is full of questions, first and foremost about the possibility of returning to normalcy after the atrocities of war, about reconciliation, and about the fight against oblivion.The quality of the film resides in avoiding rhetoric and melodrama despite the difficult themes that are addressed. The film is designed with the tools of the 'noir' film combined with elements from the German films that take place in the cabaret environment. The city of Berlin with its ghostly inhabitants waking up to reality after the war experiences, with the ruins where the cabaret with the symbolic name 'Phoenix' becomes the meeting point of the occupants with the locals, are built with attention to detail and filmed expressively. Ronald Zehrfeld gives to his role the necessary dose of ambiguity that allows us to constantly ask ourselves about the truth of amnesia and about his transformation from husband to possible accomplice to cime, from musician to crook. Nina Hoss is extraordinary, her transition from disfigurement to beauty, from trauma to the decision to try the impossible of reconciliation, are interpreted with a wealth of nuances and emotions. The final scene is symbolic and memorable. 'Phoenix' is a film experience, which I recommend to all those interested in the history of Berlin, Germany and Europe, but especially to lovers of good cinema."
" speak low
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,8,"What a huge irony. The husband failed to recognize his wife who accompanied him day and night , the handwriting, hugs, and kisses, but finally recognized Nelly from the unique number. The suffering and torture did not destroy Nelly, it was love that destroyed her."
" Betrayal?
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,10,"A question: I have always wondered why Johnny betrayed Nellie? Yes, he did divorce her, but many Aryan Germans were forced to divorce their Jewish German spouses. Is this why he divorced her? Is there anything I missed? He seems devoted to her and not just because of guilt (IMO). And just because of the divorce, it is not obvious that he told the Nazis of her hiding place in the boat house. Yes, she was found but there were others who could have exposed her hiding place like the Inn Keeper. I need to watch it again if someone on this board cannot help me answer these questions. I must have missed hints?"
" To sing the impossible song...
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,6,"The movie feels both like an adaptation of a short story, and yet also a metaphor for a lengthy and heavy thesis. It is a slow-paced film, with a character striving to guide the film towards its conclusion. It is a unique film.Definite spoilers follow, so stop reading and perhaps simply see the film for yourself. I will say I found the film thought-provoking upon reflection afterwards. More so than while watching it.--So the notion of Jewish survivors returning to Germany is a charged one, perhaps some may feel similarly to spouses returning to their abusive partners. Both come into play in this film, Nelly's dream feels impossible.And yet...Johnny has his plans, as does the director. They conflict, and the director wins while tipping his hat in multiple ways. The lack of any happy flashback memories, the current employment of Johnny, and the character of Lena as an embodiment of conscience, we know where we are going, and not just to the train station.Speaking of Lena, is she the inverted half of Nelly? (Typing their names now, phonetically they even *sound* reversed). Is Lenny the touchstone for us the audience?Or are we the audience cast as the embracing friends who greet Nelly upon her impossible return? The most difficult part of the film was hearing Johnny predict their responses, despite Nelly's protestations.Anyways a story of ""you can't go home again"" is not unfamiliar, but not in this sense. Home is more than the house you were evicted from, it's your country, your ""friends."" It's your sense of security and your very sense of self.While the nightclub gives the film its name, Nelly's character was truly left for dead before her rise from ashes and bullets. This is a rare return. The singer gets a just as rare encore, the song is slow, sad and poignant.Singing an impossible song, after surviving an unthinkable nightmare."
" 1945 or 2045?
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,1,"How does this make any sense?In 1945, a woman who is supposedly ""horribly disfigured from a bullet wound in her face"", undergoes plastic surgery and is transformed into a completely normal looking woman. I don't think this is surgically possible in the present day, so certainly not in 1945. (Just look at the primitive plastic surgery performed on British servicemen around that time; they ended up looking far from normal.)This film crumbles into dust, because it's built on an incredible foundation."
" Simple yet effective cimena
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,8,"This is a film that reminded me of Euridi's ""Helen"", which is a story that reveals thatthe great trojan war was dne for a fake Helen and the real one was actually in Egypt. So, here we have a Holocaust survivor and she is transformed into another person beacauseher face was damaged. So, her husband cannot recognize her and it goes on...
It is a tragic yet really interesting and it gets your attention but I guess it is just that. It is about identity and love and recognition and transfrmation.
The script was good, but left me want more and the whole trope of the 2nd act with the absence of ""recognition"" got kind of boring. The ending was great and raised a lot of quiestions. The soundtrack is also well-done.
The most striking thing was Nina Hoss' performance. She was astonishing in every single movement of hers and she is the main reason why I am giving this film an...

" Intelligent and emotional, but also contrived
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,7,"In Christoph Petzold's film 'Phoenix', Nina Hoss plays Nelly, a Jewish woman returned to postwar Germany from the concentration camps, both mentally and physically scarred by her experience, although having undergone superficial repair by extensive plastic surgery. In her new guise, she's drawn back to her husband, even though he may have betrayed her and now, certain his wife is dead, believes Nelly to be a doppleganger who he can use to lay claim to her wealth. But Nelly accepts him anyway, grateful for the opportunity to play the part of her former self. It's an intriguing psychological set-up. But it's somewhat contrived, and Nelly's stunning physical recovery into a beautiful (but supposedly unrecongisable) woman doesn't quite ring true. I liked the film because of the acknowledgement, rarely made in Holywood, that revenge isn't always the driving human motive, even when it might appear to be justified. But the story as presented can't quite carry the full weight of its enquiry into human nature."
" The pace is too slow
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,"The pace is too slow, and from this point of view the war rages, it is not a particularly new idea. Also, I always feel that the hostess has not put that kind of tangle and sadness in place."
" Brilliant work by Petzold and Hoss
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,9,"Shortly after the end of World War II, a Jewish Holocaust survivor named Nelly (Nina Hoss) returns to her home city of Berlin hoping to reunite with her beloved husband (Ronald Zehrfeld), a man whose character she might have over-estimated.There are many bizarre twists in the story of ""Phoenix"" (deliberately excluded to avoid spoilers) which make it all the more intense and fascinating. An odd scheme devised by two of the main characters leaves one uncomfortable and angry and how blind ""love"" can be.Director and co-writer Christian Petzold keeps viewers at the edge of the seat trying to understand the characters' motives while being reminded of the post-trauma of Holocaust survivors and the awkwardness of German citizens after being reunited with Jewish Germans they once knew before the war. The final scene is gripping as it leaves one thinking ""Oh my God, how could they end it THERE?"" but it still leaves viewers able to fit the final pieces of the puzzle on our own while recovering our emotions from watching a film of such impact.As the very complex Nelly, Hoss is superb. Whether appearing self-destructive at the beginning or showing revelations in the brilliant final scene, her face and body language say everything necessary. Zehrfeld also provides Hoss a very strong counterpart in their many scenes together.The movie genre of ""Holocaust themed films"" is filled with so many great works that it can leave the question: is it possible to even get close to this high benchmark and possibly surpass it in some ways? With ""Phoenix"", the answer is an absolute 'yes'.Outstanding Achievements:1) Directing by Christian Petzold2) Acting by Nina Hoss"
" Odd
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,6,Not believable but funny exercise of humanity. The evil vs the good kind. The good are silly and the evil are greedy and not bright.
" Beautiful story.
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,7,"I liked the movie because it gives one another perspective how people lived after the Holocaust and surviving the camps, trying to find their loved ones and get their old life back. I havent seen many movies like that.What I didnt like was the fact that Nelly immediately found the right bar where her husband was, second was the ending. I would like to have seen how she got a long after leaving the room.... how did Johnny react? Did they move on together? Or did Nelly feel like he was a traitor and left him?"
" Mind numbing. A good cure for insomnia.
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,1,"If you have trouble sleeping slip this one in the DVD player, Slow to the point of being dam near static. The acting was generally awful and the story line ridiculous. Avoid at all cost. We will not be watching it again in the future."
" Different Ashes
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,7,"Hubert Monteilhet's novel has been filmed three times I saw two of them. The 1960's Return From The Ashes and this one, Phoenix (2014) - the one I haven't seen is a TV version from the 1980's Le retour d'Elisabeth Wolff, but now I really want to see it. Phoenix is a moody, painful journey to a rebirth. Nina Hoss is lovely as the survivor, Ronald Zehofeld plays the husband, object of her obsession. He's an interesting actor, a mix between Benicio del Toro and the young Orson Welles. Their scenes together have a realistic, tangible suspense. But Christian Petzold, the director of Jerichow (2008), gives the whole film a severe pace and tone, the 1964 version has a sharp, sophisticated script by Julius J Epstein with titles like Casablanca to his credit and J Lee Thompson at the helm, Thompson directed films like The Guns Of Navarone, Cape Fear and What A Way To Go. So his version, Return From The Ashes, is a whole other experience, at time it's even funny. With a superlative international cast cast, Maximilian Schell, Ingrid Thulin and Samantha Eggar - So one can see both films as it they weren't even related."
" A thrilling plot
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,8,"""Phoenix"" tells the story of a Schoah survivor, who undergoes medical surgery on her face and moves back into her old environment. There she meets her husband, who reportedly turned her in. He notices her similarity to his wife and hires her to play her to get his hands on her money. Now, reunited with her former husband, she begins to raises question in a bitter search for her old life.The plot is very powerful. It is a clever script that allows for big emotions, desperation and uncertainty. Sometimes I would have wished that these emotions would have been displayed even more to break into the rather calm tone of the film. However this is not just an addition to the cinematographic topic but it is a whole new approach, produced very professionally and looking worthy.All in all this is a film you should give a try for it is outstanding in its way and doesn't copy others. For me the last bit was missing to make it even more moving and lasting but it nevertheless is a great piece of filmmaking."
" Truly amazing
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,9,"The pacing at the beginning is slow. However - as the plot becomes more and more intriguing, everything falls into place. The final scene is breathtaking. Superbly acted."
" reminded me of the film ""The return from the ashes""
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,10,"I may be wrong, as i am watching this, this is very much like The return from the ashes, where liv Ulman returns from the camp and meets with old lover played my maxmilian schell. who marries her for her money and tries to kill her. i really enjoyed the return from the ashes, and i am equally relishing this film."
" One of the greatest film endings. Ever.
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,9,"You do have to suspend a bit of disbelief to get there on the haunting journey, but the movie's final scene will stay with you forever. Amazing performances by the two leads and assured, understated directing that only intensifies the climax.Absolutely not to be missed, even (or particularly) if you think you've seen every possible treatment of the toll of the Holocaust on individual lives."
" typical art movie TERRIBLE ending which could have gone so many ways (better)
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,5,"awesome film.....good depiction of post-war Germany, but premise was hard to buy....how could a man not actually recognize his own freakin' wife? Sure, her face is completely different, but he would come (quickly) to recognize the rest of her for god's sake. The ending was, by every means, anti-climactic."
" Deeply moving, poetic and powerful
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,10,"At first I was quite resistant to this film. I thought, surely plastic surgery was not very good at the end of WWII? I thought surely there would be recognition where there apparently wasn't? Then I began to get it. I saw the poetry in this and how well it was handled. I saw the portrayal of an attempt to reconstruct not a face but of a life, a way of being, before it was destroyed by the Nazis.That destruction went very far, inevitably corrupting people and causing them to betray one another.Really this is a very powerful film and I urge anyone to watch it. At present this has a rating of 7.3 here at IMDb but this just tells us how films that appeal to teenagers tend to get high ratings whereas unfortunately truly great films like this one do not do so well."
" From darkness into light
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"'Phoenix' is based on a melodramatic novel by Hubert Monteilhet which was made into a 60s film about a Holocaust survivor returning to find her former lover, believing her to be dead, now involved with her daughter, leading to a tale of betrayal & murder. In 'Phoenix' the emotional story takes precedence over the melodrama/thriller elements, the film about the emotional journey of a survivor & the husband who may or may not have betrayed her.The film begins with a film-noir atmosphere, though it's quite apparent that this isn't a thriller but more a study of love, betrayal & deception. It's slow burning in pace, with hints & revelations rather than convoluted plot twists. The film is framed by two key songs, Cole Porter's 'Night & Day', one of romantic longing , the other Kurt Weill's 'Speak Low'.Nelly is a singer who has survived Auschwitz but suffered physical disfigurement so that her face has to undergo reconstruction. She is supported by her friend Lene, who plans a new future for them in Palestine. Lene asks Nelly to sing but she no longer has the strength & confidence to do so. Nelly is also obsessed by her husband & accompanist, Johannes 'Johnny' Lenz ('Johnny' conjuring up 'Surabaya Johnny', another cabaret song), who now works as a bottle-collector (& possible pimp?) at the Phoenix night-club frequented by US servicemen. The hues of the club are shot in red, haunting & dream-like ('Only mad-men can enter', Steppenwolf) with echoes of 'Red Road', another film about a woman in pursuit of a man.Nelly is still in love with the husband, who she cannot bring herself to believe betrayed her to the authorities despite Lene's misgivings. Lene is protective of Nelly, even giving her a revolver; a detail which proves to have tragic significance later though not in the way we expect. Nelly encounters Johannes once again, who is struck at once by the likeness she bears to the wife he now believes is dead. And so begins a ruse to use Esther, the alias used by Nelly, to act like his wife so that he can use her to claim her fortune.Nelly, acting out her role as Esther, goes along with the scheme, perhaps as a way of reliving the past & getting close to Johannes, even though this is simply yet another deception (self) within a deception. Johannes clearly has no understanding of what victims endured; the dramatic irony is that we, the audience, are probably more aware than Nelly is. He gives Esther/Nelly, the chic Parisian dress his 'dead' wife used to wear, the flowers resembling lips (Judas' kiss). Nelly is emotionally confused at how a survivor could wear such a bright dress (as if her true self is speaking). Johannes brushes her qualms aside, revealing that he has no understanding of the emotional/psychological suffering a survivor has gone through – in contrast to Lene who will pay the ultimate price.Trapped in the past, Nelly has survived Auschwitz but emotionally she has remained in 1944 before her arrest. She remains quite literally in the dark when she confides in Lene at night, who struggles to make her see the truth. On a bike ride with Johannes, she murmurs languidly that if he betrayed his wife, then it must have been inadvertent. But she is abruptly brought to reality by the loss of the one person who showed her genuine love & support & leaves her damning proof of Johannes' guilt. It could be seen as another betrayal, this time of trust.The film is about not only a physical disfigurement but the moral one that has taken place within Johannes himself. There is one scene where Nelly & Johannes make their preparations in a hotel room & Nelly watches him through the frosted glass: she now sees through him, or perhaps the blurred outline suggests she never really knew him.The final confrontation & 'revenge' is low-key but perhaps all the more powerful for that rather than contrived melodrama. Nelly, who has been hesitant & reluctant to sing, sings 'Speak Low' which becomes a song of farewell. The final image is striking of a woman walking out of a door, bathed in sunlight. Nelly finally sees that the past can be no more. She has been re-born emotionally, so to speak."
" ""Phoenix"" is a powerful, sobering and poignant post-WWII drama
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,9,"Christian Petzold explores the trauma of the Holocaust in a deeply psychological way in ""Phoenix,"" a drama that unfolds in the aftermath of World War II as a woman with a new face and the opportunity for a fresh start after surviving the death camps must attempt to actually put concept to practice. Petzold regular Nina Hoss stars as Nelly Lenz, a Holocaust survivor who returns home to a demolished Berlin after the war following successful facial reconstructive surgery. She lives with her close friend, also Jewish, named Lene (Nina Kuzendorf), who talks of a plan to start a new life in what will shortly become Israel, but Nelly is preoccupied with finding her husband, Johnny (Ronald Zehrfeld), the non-Jewish jazz pianist whom she was taken from during the war, but who Lene says actually betrayed her to the Nazis. When Nelly finds Johnny, he doesn't recognize her, but the resemblance is uncanny enough that Johnny conspires to make her look like her old self in order to get her family fortune out of a Swiss bank. Nelly goes along with the ploy, hoping for the truth — and that Johnny might realize it's actually her.The premise borrows from parts of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo,"" but there are no thriller elements in ""Phoenix,"" just psychological drama and a good deal of suspense between Nelly and Johnny as she becomes more and more like ""the old Nelly."" This premise provides a brilliant juxtaposition with the Nelly character on the whole, someone who desperately wants to become her old self and have her old life back, but of course, having lived through one of the worst horrors in human history, it's not so simple.Hoss hauntingly puts on this persona of a woman oddly hopeful yet deeply traumatized. Nelly is a shaky, uncomfortable character to watch, yet fascinating all the same. In her encounters with Johnny, we have the benefit of knowing what she knows and getting to see how she handles being so close yet so emotionally far from the man she loved. We see her hopeful that Johnny will connect the dots, and despondent as she struggles to inhabit the woman she once was. Petzold writes so much emotional subtext into this story and Hoss hits every note — no pun intended (as her character was a singer before the war).Music plays a rather critical role in the film as well. In addition to Johnny and Nelly's past as musicians and their reunion in the film at the aptly named Phoenix night club where we hear lots of music, Kurt Weill and Ogden Nash's ""Speak Low"" figures prominently into the story, setting a distinct tone that echoes throughout the soundtrack. Its lyrics, as well, prove all too relevant to the story without being heavy handed at all. It is one of the better and most memorable uses of a song in recent memory.""Phoenix"" plays out uneventfully, but Petzold allows the drama to unfurl in poignant fashion, revealing a story about identity and love and how time can change it all, seemingly on a whim, causing irreversible changes in our lives. It's a sobering message, but one with a truth that runs deep.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
" intriguing story
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,7,"It's Germany after WWII. Nelly Lenz is a Nazi camp survivor with facial disfigurements. She and her companion Lene Winter are returning home to retrieve their family inheritances. She gets reconstruction surgery resulting in a slightly different face. She wants to reunite with her husband Johnny Lenz despite Lene's insistence that he's the one who turned her in to the Nazis. Lene wants to build the new state of Israel. Nelly finds Johnny working at the nightclub Phoenix. He doesn't recognize her and wants her to pretend to be Nelly for a split of her estate.Expositions in movies are often derided but a good exposition is a necessity. There are a lot of murky questions. The movie doles out the story in dribs and drabs. I still don't know Nelly and Lene's actual relationship, and why Nelly assumes the identity of Esther. I'm more willing to buy into the central premise of her conflicted feelings about Johnny and his cluelessness to her true identity. It's a fascinating interior conflict and there's a real tension about the truth of her discovery."
