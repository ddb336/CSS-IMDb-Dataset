" What it feels like to be forced to hide your identitiy
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,6,The emotion part of the movie is magnificent. You really get to understand what the uncertain life of an asylant feels like. But the ending was missing details and I felt like they tried to keep the ending short. What a pity.

Like the dance. 
Funny/heartfelt, 
Einaudi's aurally awing soundtrack 
Mitigates poorly paced/unfocused plot.

Convincing 
As two lovers. 
Compelling illegal immigrant woes,

Dance! Tetractys poems stem from the mathematician Euclid, who considered the number series 1, 2, 3, 4 to have a mystical significance because of its sum of 10. He named it a Tetractys. Thus, these poems follow a 1, 2, 3, 4, 10 syllable format, with additional verses written in an inverted syllable count.

" Samba, not dancing
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,7,"This is a movie from the authors of ""The Intouchables"" (2011), so of course, the comparison will be unavoidable. But let me tell you, both movies are something different, though the style is present there, as does Omar Sy. This is a movie about life itself. It will make you feel many emotions: it will make you laugh, it will make you yelp, it will make you feel tense.On one side, you see what an immigrant without his working permit has to do in order to survive in an European country, why he is there, what he does.. On the other side, you see a burnout woman who tries to find herself back. The story simply flows slowly, as life does, no rush things (as we are used to with some American movies) but everything goes at its own speed, because there are some things that cannot be rushed.Charlotte Gainsbourg is THE movie. From the first time she is on-screen she steals the show. She really gets into character and you can feel identified with her (hell, where is my horse!!?). Opposite her there is Omar Sy, who is also great and make you feel tense at some points of the movie because of his situation. then, there are the supporting roles played by Tahar Rahim, another immigrant trying to survive in Paris, and Izïa Higelin playing a ONG worker who introduces Charlotte's character into the reality that immigrants are facing everyday.This movie feels really close to you and you cannot help but feel connect with its characters, so give it a try and watch it in its native French language!"
" Excellent, not impressive.
",2017-11-11 00:00:00,8,"Samba movie tells the story of an immigrant who has difficulty obtaining French nationality, his difficulties and passions. He began to live illegally in the country and fell in love with an assistant of the organization that helped him to conquer his stay in the country.A light story, with a Brazilian touch, with a improbable and interesting end. Good movie to watch, with an inclinous and questioning ending."
