" Very intellegent movie with minor flaws, highly underrated for sure
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,9,Please watch this movie and give a good review as this movie is a very intelligent one though the plot in general is fantasy.
" Are you a 10 and half size feet?
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,7,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the fantasy comedy The Cobbler (2014), the Sandman plays Max Simkin, a fourth-generation cobbler in New York City who lives with his mother after his father left many years ago and deals with his uninspiring daily life of fixing shoes until he comes across an out of this world stitching machine. Before I watched this flick, I quickly looked at the ratings across different platforms and found out it was soooo low. After watching it, I really do not know why theres so much hate. It's not your typical Sandler comedy flick but the story and acting were great. And give or take it was a bit emotional in particular the scenes between Max and his mother. Throughout the film you find an emotional and light hearted story. Sandler does well in his role and once again shows real depth. This movie doesn't deserve low ratings or negative reviews and I definitely recommend this film to anyone. There is a nice twist at the end and a good message throughout the film which is literally ""put yourself in somebody else's shoes."" Very unique story and great cinematography of urban New York. There are some narrative hiccups and the end does feel like it transitioned from a heist to a drama film then to a - if you call it, a superhero style film. Overall 7.4/10"
" Awful Ending to a an otherwise Good Movie
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,7,"A gentle, amusing, entertaining movie, perfect for one of those nights when you don't want to be stretched.
But the ending is possibly one of the worst I've ever seen .. the closing scene is completely unnecessary and totally out of genre. It looks like it was tacked on as an after-thought and completely destroys some of the intriguing parts of an otherwise good narrative. Some loose-ends are a good idea in a narrative and tidying them up with a ridiculous closing scene treats the viewer as being brainless and unable to cope with curiosity. In less than 5 minutes this absurd ending turns the ""missing"" father from being a person of mystery into a heartless husband and dad and a Marvel-caricature , in the same moment destroys the character of Jimmy who is beautifully played by Streve Buscemi, and gives Dustin Hoffman the final words in a film he was probably not required. The film already has a perfectly good ending in the preceeding understated scene between Carmen (Melonie Diaz) and Max (The Cobbler). My advice is switch off the movie at the last ad-break and remember the film for all its really good moments."
" Amusing if finally a bit much
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Mainly enjoyable fantasy, well played by most of the cast, so that I started imagining all the things you could do in another's shoes. It gets tangled up in its own plot twists and crime capers by the end, and the revelation about the barber was one surprise too many."
" Adam Sandler's best acting
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,I typically do not enjoy Adam Sandler movies but this was an extraordinary movie with great acting from Adam Sandler. Storyline is very straight forward with somewhat predictable ending. But the idea and execution of the movie was exceptional and heart-warming.
" A bland idea with an okay execution
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,6,"Despite the title of the review suggests the film itself is in a few ways great. The production design and premise are great and applied well. The actors and acting are good in some areas and wooden in others. The characters themselves are good but vastly underdeveloped. The writing is sometimes great/ clever and confusing or dumb in others. And the star of it all would be Sandler himself who gives a memorable performance that can be great or terrible depending on your taste. Overall this film is either a hit or miss, it is by no means a masterpiece but it is still worth a watch."
" Rollercoaster good and bad
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,5,"The idea is good but the entire script is like an rollercoaster it jumps from good to facepalm. If Adam does his own movies then he probably needs to stop, all of them contain the same formula witch is not a good one."
" Total Surprise!
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,7,I had no idea I'd end up really enjoying this movie! Seriously... total surprise!
" Top
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,8,So I thought this was a great movie well acted by Adam sandler
" Insane
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,7,"This is a really crazy movie man. Like, just wait for that twist to hit and lose your freaking mind. Oh my goodness."
" Hidden little gem
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,8,"Not your typical Adam Sandler comedy and in a good way. The story is interesting, a mix of fantasy, comedy and action. No infantile gags here but a plot with a lot of twists and a character with much more depth than usual. Adam Sandler carries this movie and his performance is one of his best. The gorgeous klezmer music and beautiful cinematography help a lot with the story telling. They add a specific ""flavor"", atmosphere to it. The pace is not too fast and shallow but also not too slow, just about right, when you think you're getting bored, something unexpected happens.
It proves, once again that the IMDB score must be used cautiously, I had little expectations due to bad reviews but this is a must see movie for Adam Sandler's fans and a sweet, beautiful movie for everyone."
" Shank's Mare Tale ridden to magical drowsiness
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,2,"This is more of a fantasy/fairy tale movie better geared for kids it had 0 laughs 0 action very little drama and a tiny little bit thriller but vastly nothingness with horrible repetitive soundtrack. After a while the Story gets very generic and nearly everything should be foreseen.
Optically it is fine but the cast is totally wasted on this since there is so little acting here. It is quite long for it's very thin story but i guess that's the tone it wanted to set.
It had some good thoughts of local businness and things like that but nvm they never actually cared for the real cause and quickly made a simple crime story out of that. The Main Character acts mostly so ""correct"" that it is even boring, but well at least he's a good paragon, most scenes are him doing his stuff so the movie even lacks dialogue or depth in that regard and has no sidekicks / fellowships or much character development so it feels very unilateral.
If i was rated by kid-me it would probably score 4 or 5 but after experiencing so many stories this does nothing better than many others nor more entertaining probably would be suited way better as a comic novel.
Also the Ending was pretty dumb."
" Slow and boring
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,2,Watched about 50% and turned it off. Very slow and story line just isn't interesting.There is a lot of big names in this film but don't be fooled it's terrible. Adam Sandler doesn't seem interested in his character
" Slow and boring
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,2,Not funny. Very slow. Watched about 50% and turned it off.There is a lot of big names in this film but it is terrible. Adam Sandler doesn't seem interested in the character he is playing
" Brilliant film
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,10,"Funny, whimsical, sadness, Drama, one of Adam Sandler great films, very impressed"
" Really enjoyable Sandler film
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,8,"Not sure why some of the reviews are so negative. Maybe some are expecting the usual Adam Sandler films...such as Happy Gilmore and the waterboy etc (all of which I really like)
This is a different kind of film for Adam Sandler, a really good story nice twists and good plot. I really enjoyed it. Imaginative, different and very well done.
It is a welcome relief from some of the really high budget CGI fests that I've seen lately. Many of them fall flat and fail. Give it a watch and ignore the haters. Great film."
" mediocre entertainment
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,5,"The story was interesting and new to me.
The first half of the film was better than the second.
Overall OK."
" The Cobbler
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,5,"The subject matter of the film is very interesting,But the plot is so bad.I think the director needs to reflect on his problems."
" I liked it despite (not because of) Adam Sandler.
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,7,"People are dissing this movie because it isn't one of Adam Sandler's usual sophomoric, potty-humor laced romps hopped up on Red Bull.This film manages to entertain despite Sandler being horribly miscast as the main character. Steve Buscemi was surprisingly great as the barber neighbor. I had never seen him play a ""regular guy"" before. He's always some version of the ugly, cross-eyed weirdo. This could have been a great movie with another actor in Sandler's role, but I still give it a solid 7."
" My favorite Adam Sandler movie
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,10,"I usually pass on his movies but I watched this one and liked it. The acting and script were excellent, I thought it was an all around great movie."
" Wut
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,5,Don't waste your time the beginning is worst the middle is kinda good but then it gonna shock you how stupid it is
" Sandler Cobbles Together A Fantastic Film!
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,9,"Like many others who have reviewed this film, I'm surprised by the overall low rating. This is, by far, Sandler's best attempt in a dramatic role that I have seen... and I have seen every film Adam Sandler has put out there.The Cobbler tells the heartwarming story of Max Simkin (Sandler) who discovers a magical sewing machine that allows him to step into the lives of his customers. While there are some humorous moments in the film, Sandler's performance takes a more dramatic approach as his character begins to utilize his newfound ability to bring about positive changes, bringing a bit of happiness to others in the process.This is a MUST SEE movie for anyone who enjoys seeing actors step outside their comfort zones. What's more, the film is perhaps Sandler's best and most rewarding work in a long time."
" Surprise
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,8,A truly interesting story. I hardly understand the votes of the magazines.
" Gentle and interesting film with good cast
",2019-09-16 00:00:00,8,This is a genuinely nice film. Good story with a few twists. Starts off slow but stick with it.
" Beautiful film
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,9,What a beautiful film. The story and humour are a perfect balance. It is definatley worth watching. Sandler plays a great role.
" Nothing here.
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,2,"The Cobbler isn't funny or evoking or thought-provoking, nothing happens basically.My immediate thought after watching the film, is why was it made?... It ain't offensive like people say, it's even safe to the point of being dull. It's also obvious that Buscemi's Max's father."
" Strange but good
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,7,Liked the Jewish theme. definitely worth more than 9% on rotten tomatoes. Has some loose ends that need sorting out but overall pretty enjoyable. Almost felt like being in Pulp Fiction lol.
" This is the definition of the middle
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,5,"I really wanted to like this movie more because it had such an interesting premise and I adore Adam Sandler. However, Sandler's performance was very flat. It wasn't up to the level of his comedy or his more serious roles. And the plot got more preposterous as it went on. There were so many interesting characters that could have been explored, but they weren't. Instead each persona was only used to further a boring plot that was ultimately not that interesting. The ""love story"" was maybe the most unbelievable as the characters had no chemistry. In the end, I was left with a lot of questions and wanting more.If you're looking for something to pass the time, there are worse things to watch, which is why I gave it 5 stars. But if you want to see a great Sandler movie, either go back to one of his comedies or check out The Meyerowitz Stories, which is really excellent drama."
" Not that bad
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,7,"If you go into this film with the right state of mind it is very enjoyable. It might have a stupid premise but Adam Sandler (and most of the cast) give a really good preformace, which helps this film stand out among the rest of Adam Sandler's recent work."
" Interesting plot, some good actors, and a very bad outcome
",2019-03-28 00:00:00,3,"The movie starts of like a family movie that has magical elements in it. Quickly though, the film starts getting lost in the plot and it's hard to tell what is happening. One minute you like the main character and then suddenly you don't even know what is going anymore or who he is.The script must have been rushed because it sure felt like it. If there is a moral to all this or point is unclear.If this film made it clear what it was trying to achieve and stuck to it, this could of been an average more enjoyable movie."
" A Magical Fairytale Come To Life
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,9,"I haven't yet seen an Adam Sandler movie that I don't like. I've been a fan since the first time I heard red hooded sweatshirt. This movie, while slightly dragging a little bit in places, and having quite a few places where I say no no no don't do that! Reminds me so much of the Fairy Tail movies I used to watch as a child. And while the cobbler does some things selfishly, without giving away any spoilers, in true fairy tale fashion you will see that the ending is not only the right one but extremely rewarding! This movie is definitely a must-see not only for any Adam Sandler fan, but for anyone who wants to get a little bit of their youth back in their step!"
" Ignore the haters
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,10,A really touching movie with something for everyone. Great cast and performances. A sleeper..... Wu Tang forever! Peace
" Worthy of a better rating
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Creative, interesting and amusing are thoughts that come to mind after watching the Cobbler. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed this film. The concept was very creative and fascinating. It also had quite an alright story to ground the fantasy.If rewritten or directed differently perhaps with a bit more flair and moments this could have been an incredible film. Nevertheless, it was still pretty good and deserves a higher rating on here.7.5/10"
" Ending doesnt make sense...(SPOILERS)
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,7,"So I actually really like this movie. A lot. But I had to ding it a couple stars because the ending makes absolutely no sense. At the beginning of the move, Max puts on shoes that belonged to a guy that is now dead, so he looks like a corpse. Then at the end when his dad shows him the store room of hundreds of shoes from people that are lng dead, he says they can be disguises. But wouldn't these shoes also, by the films earlier logic, also make him look like a corpse? I love this movie but that gap in logic really bothers me."
" A really sweet, heartfelt film.
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,8,I also don't understand all the hate about this film. This also stars Dustin Hoffman. This was perhaps Adam Sandlers best attempt at the other-than-comedy genre. I was never a big fan of his comedy anyway. It's been a while and I don't remember this at all. But it would make a good date movie imo.
" Better than expected
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,8,"I don't understand the low rating for this movie; it's pretty decent. It's a lfunny, heartwarming tale that, despite a few plot holes, manages to follow it's own train of thought at a nice even pace. Also I thought that, and here's a bit of a spoiler, being able to transform into a person by wearing their shoes is a pretty cool idea for a superhero."
" GUARDIANS OF SOLES
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,6,"Max Simpkin (Adam Sandler) through a series of circumstances discovers he has a machine in his basement that is magical. When used on shoes, it will turn the wearer into someone who looks like its original owner. Max tinkers with the shoes of his customers and finds himself in a situation in a not too well developed story.The idea was cute. I am not sure that is the way I would have gone. The acting was okay. Steve Buscemi plays a subdued role as a barber. Dustin Hoffman role is slightly beyond that of a cameo. Ellen Barkin looks good for 60.Makes for an okay rental. Not a laugh out loud type comedy.Guide: No f-bombs or sex. Woman in shower with some strategic covering."
" What a stupid movie!
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,1,"This is a movie, that thinks the audience is absolutely stupid. So the tempo is killingly slow and the movie keeps repeting it self, so we all can keep up!"
" Adam's career is officially OVER
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,1,OMG don't watch this movie. It's unbearably UNfunny. Adam needs to retire and banned from ever making another movie after this betrayal of a film!!
" One of Adam Sandler movies with an accurate rating.
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,5,"First off I love Adam Sandler and his movies...That being said, even though I am a big fan of Adam I did not like this movie enough to watch twice. It was interesting to see him play a serious role, but the movie as a whole didn't work for me. I really enjoyed Punch Drunk Love. That is still Adam's best serious role movie."
" Incomprehensibly bad
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen.Adam Sandler plays a sociopath that you're supposed to sympathize with; however, one of the first scenes involves him putting the shoes of someone else on, becoming that person, then going to that person's house and almost raping the guy's girlfriend in the shower but then realizing he can't because he would have to take his shoes of and change back into his real self. OMG. WTF.Another scene involves a 2 minute montage of him becoming different people when he puts their shoes on; one of these people happens to be transgender. The montage then stops abruptly to make an incredibly awkward and unfunny joke about transgender people: as he looks in the mirror, he says, ""I'm a woman"", then he puts his hand in his pants and pulls it out, shaking it in disgust, ""No I'm not, no I'm not!""When he's a Chinese person, he goes to chinatown for the first time. When he's a black person, he robs people.The climax involves him, playing the transgender woman, kidnapping a drug dealer. The drug dealer overpowers him and the drug dealer says, ""don't worry, I'm not going to shoot you, she-man. I'm going to choke you to death"". The man begins to do so, until Sandler kicks him in the neck with his high-heel, killing him. 
Remember, this is supposed to be a comedy.In the final scene, Steve Buscemi becomes Dustin Hoffman, Adam Sandler's dad, and he tells Adam about how he has learned about what it means to be a cobbler. They get into a limo in the back of a barber shop and drive off into the night, setting up a sequel."
" Quirky gem of a film.
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,9,"I really don't understand the negative reviews of this film, I was hooked right from the getgo, and I usually can't stand Adam Sandler!"
" Good in it's own way.
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,7,"The first 40 minutes from the movie are a bit boring, but then the plot is growing and you start feeling the movie. I love Adam Sandler and I love his character, but in this movie he is somebody else, but in a good way. The ending makes the movie even better, cause it is not what you would expected. 7/10"
" It was O-K-A-Y
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,6,"I had never even heard of this movie but saw it in the video store by accident and bought it only because it's an Adam Sandler film.
Well, if anything it is one of the most original stories I've seen.
Very different.
It also explains why I stayed in school and don't have to go through the humdrum existence of living like the cobbler does.
It was an OKAY movie but not one I'll watch again any time soon.
Perhaps in a few years when i come across it in my collection and can't remember what it is about, I'll take it out again and give it a go."
" i cannot believe the amount of people that have rated this quite hightly
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,1,"loads of spoilers, but how can you spoil a really bad and in many ways a nasty film. let me say that i am an adam sandler fan, and have liked most of his films. this could have been great but has one of the worst scripts and stories ever put to film. so the idea of getting to know someone by stepping into their shoes is a good idea. so what do they do with it, he finds out using a special stitcher, handed down for generations, and if the shoe fits then he becomes that person. but only physically and with their voice, he is still himself. so instead of thinking of good uses for this, the film spends about 15 minutes with him goofing around beceome other people, none of this is funny, he then gets involved with a nasty gangster and decided to become him, leading him into ever more stupid escapades that no person with normal intelligence would ever dream of doing,this all leads to a plot to throw and old timer out of his apartment, or burn him down, and by even more stupid and unlikely plots twists Sandler saves the day. there is one bit where he puts on his dads's shoes, the dad in question having abandoned him and his mother, to grant his mum's wish to spend one last evening with her husband, this came very near to incest, throughout the film the character does'nt not develop, grow and learn anything, he is as stupid and undynamic as he was at the start. we kept watching to see how they would get to the happy ending, and we wish we had not"
" Baffling
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,2,"The only word to describe this movie is baffling. The movies premise is stupid and it's executed, you guessed it, terribly. The plot is convoluted and boring to say the least. The acting isn't good and from a technical stand point it's decent. The cinematography, score and editing are all fine it's just the script is absolutely baffling. Everything that happened was just unbelievable. I watched this film in complete awe at what was happening. So many terrible things happen. Adam Sandler in one scene puts on his Dad's shoes and has a date with his Mom. Yes, that actually happens in the movie. He also puts on the shoes of a guy who has a hot girlfriend, goes over to the guys house and almost has sex with the girlfriend. However, he couldn't because he would have to take his shoes off. I mean really? It also has one of the dumbest twists I've ever seen on film. So, overall the movie is just dumb and my only response while watching it was utter confusion at what complete trash I was witnessing. It's almost worth watching because of just how ridiculous it is, almost."
" Much better than I expected!
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,9,"I'm very confused as to why this movie has such bad reviews! It was really unique and had some really funny moments. It's not what you would expect from Adam Sandler but not totally unexpected either. It's along the lines of Click or Bedtime Stories though I think it's far better than those two. This isn't a perfect movie by any means but it is leagues better than Sandler's newest films (The Ridiculous Six/ Sandy Wexler). For anyone on the fence about watching it I say give it a chance, especially if you are a Sandler fan. It was a lot of fun to watch."
" I liked this film
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this film, where Adam Sandler gave a good Robin Williams type serious role performance that showed off some of his talented acting abilities. I would love to see Adam Sandler play in a few more serious type of roles, where I would even say that he would very pleasantly surprise the Oscars panel if offered a good role similarly to what Tom Hanks did in Philedelphia! Keep up the good work Adam!"
" You Don't Mess With The Cobbler
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,9,"Sandler with another good comedy. It wasn't big budget or super Hollywood. It was, in turn, extremely enjoyable to consume. Many have been dogging Sandler since the movie Click, by saying he lost his way. Sandler is still funny, and he proves that with this film. However I don't believe this film was intended to be just comedy. It just had a good feel to it."
" No laughs and little entertainment in this strange film
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,3,"""The Cobbler"" is one mixed genre of fantasy, magic, drama and comedy that just doesn't work. The actors aside, the plot for this film just doesn't seem to have any substance. It's mostly multiple little scenarios tied together by the thinnest of threads. Apparently, Adam Sandler thought this was just the right film for him. But, it's an example of how far off in perception of what is entertaining, different groups can be. The filmmakers thought this was a good product, but the critics and most of the audiences thought otherwise. It's rated from poor to awful. Dustin Hoffman joining the cast didn't help with such a messy plot. The producers must have realized that audiences weren't going to take to this film after its Sept. 11, 2014 showing at the Toronto International Film Festival. Its release was then delayed for months in several countries. It March 2015 it had only limited release in the U.S., with video on demand at the same time. Adam Sandler's previous two films were flops, but ""The Cobbler"" probably is the biggest flop of his career."
" Ignore the ridiculously low ratings!!
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,8,"So....I almost NEVER watch movies; usually don't have the patience for them and don't find most of them enjoyable; stumbled upon this on Netflix, said to the hubby ""this sounds weird enough to be good"" and started watching. Had no idea all those big names were in it - Adam Sandler, Steve Buscemi, Dustin Hoffman...plus what I thought was a great cast of unknowns (well...unknown to me, that doesn't mean much!).Anyway, I think it's a great movie, very different from most movies out there and a great performance by Adam Sandler...there's a great tear- jerkin scene with his mom and his dad but I can't say more because of spoilers, but I had me teary-eyed...You got nothing to lose by watching it, so do it!"
" Wow what a great movie!
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,10,I'm so glad I ignored all the negative reviews and watched this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. At times I even forgot it was Adam Sandler. He actually acted like a real person and I think it is his best role and best acting yet. I think this movie should be labeled a classic. I loved the back story that set the stage for this movie and all of the ups and downs Adams character had to go thru as he grew as a person inside. I think this is a must see movie.
" intriguing concept goes flat
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,4,"Max Simkin (Adam Sandler) is a cobbler in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He unhappily follows his late father (Dustin Hoffman) and fathers all the way back. Jimmy (Steve Buscemi) is his friend and barber next door. Carmen Herrara (Melonie Diaz) is a local organizer trying to stop land developer Elaine Greenawalt (Ellen Barkin). Local thug Leon Ludlow (Method Man) brings in his shoes. Max is stitching a new sole when the machine breaks down. He goes down to the basement to dust off the old manual stitcher. After fixing Leon's shoes, Max tries them on and finds himself turned into a copy of Leon. The magical machine had been passed on from father to son.There are a few ways to go with this intriguing concept. It could be a heart-felt indie about walking a mile in someone's shoes. It could be a superhero origin story. It could be a dark dive or a comedic take into humanity. This fails to walk down any of these more compelling paths. I'm not sure if it's Adam Sandler or a failure by Tom McCarthy. I tend to blame McCarthy. I expected more from him. This is not completely horrible like many of Sandler's recent efforts but it is still not good."
