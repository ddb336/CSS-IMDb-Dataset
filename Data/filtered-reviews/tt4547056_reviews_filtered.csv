" A very clever twist on the overdone Zombie movies
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,9,"I rarely watch R movies - they just don't agree with my personal beliefs and they are often downers. This one certainly qualifies. But I was intrigued enough after the first 10 minutes to watch it through to the end.
Zombie movies are a dime a dozen now and are usually just splatter-fests. This one really lets you invest in the characters and you want to see it through to the end - will humanity be saved?
Glenn Close is her usual brilliant self and I didn't recognize her at first due to her British accent. And the actress who plays Melanie - the little girl ""with the gifts"" - is excellent as well.
Some people will draw comparisons to ""The Crossing"" and I can see some similarities. All in all, a zombie movie unlike any other and excellent acting."
" Oh, Ellie...wait
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,7,"Ignore the terrible poster, this isn't a bargain bin knock off film. Well...it kind of is? This is going to be a weird one...So in some ways, this is one of the most original and interesting zombie films I've ever seen. In others, it's honestly in borderline rip-off territory. I'll start with the original stuff - I love the presentation of the zombies themselves, it does something much more interesting than the expected ""only one who's immune"" trope, and the story sounds amazing on paper.Buuuuuuut...come on Colm, I liked The Last Of Us too, but man he must have really fallen in love with those mushroom zombies. Same concept, they even namedrop the exact fungus that inspired the infected in that game at one point, and while they do have something that makes the immune girl more than just that trope, she is just Ellie with less personality.But at the same time...that ending though. That was interesting, but also the entire second act becomes mostly generic zombie fare...and it kind of spoils the whole film right at the beginning with its obvious symbolism...hmmmmm.If you couldn't tell, I'm a little mixed on this. I definitely enjoyed it, and I think it's definitely worth a watch if you got really sick of generic zombie stuff around the time when everyone was doing it, but I can't ignore how it does still fall into quite a few of the same trappings.But there is a lot that is a million times better than a huge majority of zombie films, like the acting (this girl needs some new roles, stat.) and sweet god is the soundtrack creepy.At the same time though, I also didn't think it was amazingly well directed, nor did I really care about any of the characters much, sooooooo...I guess it's a 7."
" So good!!!
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,10,I usually only leave reviews because I'm so offended at what I've just watched that I need to say something but this was not the case here in the least. Wonderfully atmospheric and eerie. Original idea executed by great actors. The writing was also top notch. This film fired on all Cylinders!!!
" Good new take on the zombie genre
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,6,This story brings an interesting new take on the zombie genre. The only catch is that the depth of the story and the perspective are not a patch on what comes across in the book. Very glad I read the book first.
" ANGER
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,8,"This is an amazing film with great scoring, but I absolutely hate the child. The main character ruined my experience and if she was simply not there it would be a 10/10. This is the most angry I have ever been while watching a movie. It is not a roller coaster of emotions, it is just pure anger. Great film."
" Great stuff!
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,8,"A totally fresh take on the zombie genre, with quite a dark and sinister undertone and ending. But why is it labelled ""Action, Adventure, Drama"" when it clearly is a horror movie?Actors are all great and in my mind Glenn Close really stands out: She really impersonates her role so well.There are many things I wish to tell you but I do not want to run the risk of spoiling things for you all. Just ask yourselves what the ending really means, and I am sure you will like that part also."
" The ending makes sense if you payed attention
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,9,"Most reviews here talk about the first half of the film being this masterpiece and the last portion letting them down. Without spoiling anything; Melanie says in the penultimate scene ""You taught me"". The script literally throws this concept at the viewer throughout the film. So in my opinion her choice makes sense, and only further adds to what such a dystopian world would do to a young childs mind. And if that last line of the film doesn't send chills down your spine, you truly weren't paying attention."
" Ironic stab at today's greed
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,8,"Simplistic yet pertinent, this drama begins about a fungal contagion and the search for an effective vaccine but veers toward a deeper message: now that we're dealing with the coronavirus and idiots are rampaging on the US Capitol (for which a vaccine is unlikely). Metaphors, parables and allegories abound in this lean and (extremely) low-budget film, a very UK product full of irony, the first being that the ""alien"" here is our so-so-cherished children. Over half a century ago the author John Wyndham got this with the 1957 sci-fi novel Midwich Cuckoos. Strangely, even after thousands of walking-dead movies, one wonders if young watchers actually know where the zombie idea originates in the first place (look it up). Its corollary is fear of the Other, itself the trigger of all human violence, ranging from casual racism and micro-aggressions to ethnic control and cleansing in all its forms: territorial invasions and extermination. One might include also farming animals for food as a form of ethnic control, though our beloved beef cows constitute the single largest mammal biomass (650 million tonnes) on the planet, nearly double that of humans (350 mil), thanks to our insatiable appetite for bleeding meat, a voracity paralleled here by babies eating their way out of their mother's wombs, along with a chained ""hungry"" eating himself for lack of other victims. The symbolism stacks up thanks to the screenwriter Carey's sense of fun. The kid Melanie roams, finds a cat. . . (""I already had a cat,"" she says later). Then she explores a house and discovers modernity (fridge magnets), and a dog. What follows is hilarious. A new generation/species takes over from the wasteful ever-warring humans. As the reviewer adelao-02096 rightly titles her/his review, quoting from Melanie: ""Why should it be us who die for you?"" Let the zombies take over for pete's sake, we've destroyed enough already. Eating each other instead of cows and chickens might be the solution."
" Sick movie
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,1,"It is a good movie to see if you are at least 8 of 10 on a mentally health scale but from my opinion This movie should be forbidden, a mentally sick person could do a great damage by taking ideas from this movie. I honestly don't believe my comment needs more details."
" A good movie with a very disappointing audio experiences
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,2,"A really good horror movie ruined by one of the worst audio experiences I have ever had. The ADR makes it feel like I'm watching a low budget dubbed film. The foley and ADR has no sence of acoustic presence. It all feels like it has been mixed ""in your face"" as opposed to being realistically placed in a physical environment. The ambience track seems to have been forgotten all together.
Perhaps this a creative decision, but I noticed it in the first spoken line and was not able to get any immersion whatsoever after that. Too bad to ruin a good movie this way.."
" NOT a ""zombie apocalypse"" or even 'zombie apocalypse adjacent'
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,"I'm continually stunned that this flick hasn't gotten better reviews as it's a real gem from the amazing soundtrack to it's lead actor (who i hope will go on from strength 2 strength as she's a really talented delight). 1stly, i felt the soundtrack was more sonic architecture than ""music"" & more power 2 it as such. sometimes relying on subsonics 2 enhance the visceral nature of the narrative arc which is in a nutshell, an ecological assault upon the human race resulting in a mutation causing a species reorganization. it's eerie, creepy at times & VERY thought provoking, w/top shelf casting that incl gemma arterton, paddy considine, glenn close & the debut of a young black female brit who more than holds her own in such a talented group. by the very end i couldn't help but feel the director would be an excellent choice 2 handle margaret atwood's ""oryx & crake"" material(s) screen adaptations. there r a few small but bothersome flaws i won't go into but overall this movie illustrates something i've felt 4 yrs now; if u just move away from the predictable casting of young white adolescent leads 4 a non-white, you're already increasing the intrigue factor (even 4 the most pedestrian material-which this is NOT btw). it also avoids neat happy ending cliches by a country mile while still tacking towards an optimistic (albeit weirdly so) coda. i cannot recommend this enough as i found it lingered w/me on many levels 4 a long time afterward."
" Unusual zombie movie
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,With less action and more story. Of course there are your usual scenes where people really act stupid but the end was just amazing.
" What a mess
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,4,"The movie starts promising, you guess whats going on in this facility, and the overall atmosphere is dark and gritty. But then it starts to go out of hand. The first time I felt ashamed for the people in the movie was the scene with the arm and the kids, you will know it when you see it. Just embarassing hilariously bad acting. The next embarrasment, is in the operating room
*minor spoiler* a women gets bitten by a ""hungry""(yeah, people in movies always dont know what zombies are [ðŸ™„]) and turns into seconds into one of them. The way she acts was just too much for me, it was hard to watch, because I felt ashamed for the performance of the actress, and couldnt stop laughing at the badness *minor spoiler ends*Together with the bad zombie acting, the very bad cgi effects (0% practical effects) and the dumb decisions some major characters make and the sometimes unconvincing scenes, made it a torture for me to watch this movie."
" Amazing
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,10,I have watched 10 times already. Might watch again tonight. I 8
" Very good in every respect
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,9,"As many other reviewers have noted, this movie is far better than most in this genre; but it also simply stands out as a very good movie in and of itself, even apart from genre considerations (though I can't resist saying how far superior this movie is to the perpetually overrated 28 Days After).It is not very often that a movie proves to be genuinely unpredictable, but such is the case here. The script is literate, the story well-told, the character development not stock, like you would be forgiven for expecting in a quote-unquote ""genre flick.""In addition, the acting is excellent and each character is well cast. The young lead, Sennia Nanua, carries a powerful presence and will be a force to be reckoned with as she continues to hone her craft. She does not merely hold her own in the midst of extremely skilled and experienced actors like Glenn Close, but dominates every scene she's in; and she's in almost every scene. Between her and other talented young actors like Millie Bobby Brown we have a lot to look forward to. This movie is worth watching for Ms Nanua's performance alone.And then there's the score. It is beautiful, atmospheric, and creates a lush landscape, at once suspenseful and meditative. During the last half of the movie especially, it sounds like they are making use of the theremin, and in a way even more haunting then usual for that instrument.And wow what an ending! There were so many ways they could have messed it up, but they didn't. It's unexpected and perfect. I can't recommend this movie enough."
" Lower the expectations
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,6,"After reading some glowing reviews and recommendations I must say I was extremely disappointed with this movie. It starts out very well when we are kept in the dark about what's happening and Sennia Nanua is very good at this point, balancing menace and sweetness very well. But then a regular zombie movie happens and all the pitfalls manifest themselves, with human stupidity driving the plot and all the characters becoming one dimensional cardboard archetypes, like the teacher with the heart of gold, the ruthless army soldier and the unscrupulous scientist. Still it's well done and enough for a recommendation, just lower your expectations."
" Starts well then derails
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,4,The story starts great like a mystery slowly revealing answers with good character development focusing on a small band of survivors as they escape the compound infested with zombies. It's a standard zombie movie with more drama and less action. But it loses steam in the last half especially the part where the girl fends off the other zombie kids which drags on too long. But at least the ending adds an uplifting twist. Overall not a bad watch but it won't satisfy fans looking for more science or those looking for more action and a letdown given the nice setup. World war z is much better with more action and a better story and ending but this isn't a terrible watch. The script just needed some tweeks.
" Highly recommend
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,9,"Coming into watching this film I knew only what was in the preview. It was nothing I expected. The main character (Melanie) is someone I really wanted to see thrive by the end of the first few sceens.I frequently found myself trying to guess what would happen next, but at many turns was surprised. The character I least liked at the start of thw film was one I wanted to see make it by the end.Over all it was a really interesting take on a zombie movie and I'd recommend to anyone. (Well, unless you get nightmares easily)"
" Glen close
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,7,Auto the movie with pretty good I give a 7 out of 10 deathly recommended check this one out I love climb close to see this 1.
" Great, super original, watch it.
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,9,"I don't want to talk too much about the movie itself because the less you know about it, the better.Just know that the writing is good, the acting is great and the filmmaking is amazing (just a few too dark shots here and there).I was interested from the first second until it ended. One of the best zombie movies out there."
" Lacking depth, and Exhibits Snobbery
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,1,"First off, this is a pandering drama with a moral message to let the next generation take over, and kill the old people/ideas. They aren't even clever anymore, its just so apparent and its just a tired message. Secondly, the film is boring, its not exciting, scary and doesn't capture real human emotion. You dont feel any connection with any character. Often you feel curious cause of the form of zombie they create, but you are disappointed again because you never learn more about the creatures. The average person who is expecting to be entertained, like zombie films, and like the mindless jump scares be warned, this film is terrible unless the message of the film is one that resonates with you."
" What happened?
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,5,The movie seemed to start out good and we were interested in what was to come but somewhere near the end things went completely DOWN hill. Hated the ending. There was so many ways this could have went and those chose that? Nope. Im being nice by giving it a 5/10 because i liked the beginning and the idea of the storyline but really it was a waste of almost 2 hours after it was all said and done and you're given that ending. Wow! Just wow!
" Sad that I waited
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,7,"I should've watched this movie a while ago. It's a while lot better than I thought. Solid, new take on the genre. The English actually did well with this one, compared to that 28 Days Later nonsense. Good job and glad it was made before 2016, so it doesn't try to check if so the boxes. It even has dry humor that works. In the final scenes that spark the reveal, I just kept laughing as I said, No,no,no. They actually went there. I don't do spoilers, but will say I didn't see that coming. This film had its own formula. Kudos"
" Great film
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,8,"I went into this movie blind and was extremely glad I did, it did not disappoint. I'm not a huge fan of zombie films but this was so much more. The main character Melanie is an amazing young actress who carried the film, by the end you really care about what happens to her."
" Original take on the zombie genre
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,8,"The Girl With All the Gifts offers up a very interesting and original concept for the genre. The first act is by far the strongest section of the film, creating an intriguing world and the young lead gives a great performance. The latter half of the film still has a few original ideas, but unfortunately the story becomes more derivative. If the first section of the film where expanded to create the entire story, I think it would have made for a better film."
" Refreshing Zombie Movie - Watch it!
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,10,"I have seen many zombie movies and often it is hard to tell them apart.
This movie is special because it proves how a good story can make all the difference. The zombie setting is great but it is not the primary focus of this movie.
It's the relatable characters and the dynamic between them that makes this movie great and not the fact that it takes part during a zombie apocalypse. I believe that this movie could also have worked just as well in a sci-fi setting."
" Read the book first
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,6,"I read the book first before I knew the film existed, there's alot of character development and context that's missed out on the film. It's a decent watch but probably would be better as a short TV series."
" Then why should it be us who die for you?
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,9,"Many said it was brilliant, except for the end. I think it was the end that was truly brilliant. Humans feel entitled to have it all, we are superior, we were here first... but what if that's not true? Melanie is willing to sacrifice herself, till she understands that her kind are also living creatures. After, she does what every living creature would, make sure her kind survive.
Of course the ending is unrealistic, the teacher would not survive in that airlock and her capabilities to educate would be limited, but the concept is thrilling... human kind needed ages to evolve from neanderthal to what it is today... how far can these new little neanderthals evolve, being subject to an education from the start?"
" That ending though
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,6,It was an interesting change of pace for zombie movies though resembling too much to a certain video game. Good acting all around that ending though was just weird felt very unsatisfactory.
" Not your normal Zombie movie
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,7,"From the very first scene, you could see this wasn't your average horror movie. I'm sure George Romero watched this and thought, damn, why didn't I think of that. With a great cast, good direction and brilliant plot, the best Zombie movie I've seen in years. Definitely one to watch."
" Unfair Reviews - A Good Watch
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,8,"Many people on here are slating The Girl with All the Gifts for plagiarising The Last of Us. For many people, they were excited to watch this as the 'unofficial Last of Us' film as the promises of a movie are yet to come to fruition. I personally, as a Last of Us fan, enjoyed this film. Accusations of plagiarism are a bit unfair. The Girl with All the Gifts is based on a book of the same name, a year after the release of the Last of Us. The author states he did not plagiarise The Last of Us and many reviews from strong fans of the game agree. The two stories share some similarities but are different, with the Last of Us of course being superior; the centre around the same kind of fungus, Ophiocordyceps Unilateralis. This fungus is not created for the story, it is a real fungus that exists in nature. Since I am still waiting for the TLOU movie adaptation, this was good to watch.The low reviews are incredibly unfair, leaving the overall rating a 6.6; I almost considered not watching due to a relatively low rating for British cinema, but I am glad I watched in spite of this, as I did enjoy this film."
" The Last of Us
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,1,"This was quite the ambitious movie. Besides, anyone who has heard of or played The Last of Us knows this is plagiarism. Right down to the stairwell being blocked off by office furniture."
" A thoughtful take on the zombie genre!
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,7,"It's taken me an age to finally get round to watching this movie and all though it is good, it did fall slightly short of my expectations.After a very strong start and a solid story throughout, it still felt a little anti-climatic by the end.It is a clever take on the genre, and in a really odd way it reminded me of Matterson's novel 'I am Legend' (not the movie!)It was brave and original to go for the finale the way they did in this movie, it just fell short of what I wanted.It's good, it makes you think, it is clever and well executed in the most part, and it has some really good scenes that are littered througout the picture rather than thrust into one section of the movie.Worth a watch if you're prepared to be patient and give it your full attention.7/10"
" So...The Last of Us
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,7,This movie is so similar to TLoU I'm surprised no one was sued. That being said it's not bad. Suffers from some pacing issues and stilted dialogue but cinematography is great and the main kid is adorable.Pretty formulaic story so don't expect to be surprised by anything.
" Best Book to Movie Adaptation I've Ever Seen!
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,10,"Wow! First I didn't even KNOW there was a movie after I read the book. I just stumbled on it and thought ""well, probably sucks but I'll give it a shot"", and boy was I surprised! Of course it helps a lot that the author wrote the script. Everything else, the acting, directing, atmosphere scenes!! Great stuff! I highly recommend this and of course the book too!"
" Interesting
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,7,"One of the more interesting takes in the zombie. I like how they weren't immediately revealed. I also liked how furturistic-y the setting is. I really enjoyed how it ends. The tone is carried through the film really well, it's scary yet kind of sad as the characters wander through the wreckage of a city. I also liked how I couldn't predict the ending."
" So many gifts, it might as well be Christmas!
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,8,"If you're at all into horror, it's entirely possible that you're wholly burnt out on zombie movies.That's reasonable, at one point in time zombies were as prevalent and boring as many superhero movies are today. If you give it a chance though, you'll find that the Girl with all the Gifts brings some truly interesting new elements to the table and sticks the landing in a bold, inventive, and fresh way.The acting across the board is pretty solid, Glenn Close is (as usual) phenomenal. Paddy Considine and Gemma Arterton are both interesting characters and believable in their roles, but their portrayals do suffer in a way I'll describe later. The real standout here though is Sennia Nanua in the title character of Melanie, she truly IS the girl with all the gifts. Her performance has a stumble here and there, but overall Sienna single handedly carries most the movie on her emoting power alone. Much is asked of her as an actor and, for the most part, she really delivers! The biggest problem with the movie is that it desperately needed more character moments with the characters of Sgt Eddie and Helen. Both characters gave off the impression of having more going on below the surface of their personalities, and fleshing them out a little bit more would have really made the story stronger.The narrative starts out strong, establishing a unique central mystery and clear sense of place. The movie doesn't spoon-feed you answers but it also doesn't hold your hand. It's able to pull off mysterious and meaningful without dipping into pretension. The situation our characters find themselves in gets turned on its head several times throughout the course of the movie. While this is great because you'll never really know what's going to happen next, the film is never able to recover that initial sense of strong space and mystery, instead, occasionally settling into something a bit more tired and familiar.Fortunately, this narrative uneasiness is salvaged by several truly memorable characters, all with clashing yet understandable motivations. There are no real cut and dry villains here, just people with very different goals. The movie's ending is bombastic, unexpected, and probably pretty divisive. As someone who's seen way too many zombie movies, I was thrilled to have an ending that felt brand new while still leaving me satisfied...but I can see where some may be disappointed with the direction it goes in.Another point to the movie's credit is its budget. At a reported budget of 5 million pounds, this is a post-apocalyptic movie with visuals more interesting than many I've seen with ten times the cost. Given the low price point, that alone both speaks to the focus of the filmmakers and to the excess of most Hollywood blockbusters.In terms of content, there's some minor gore and harsh language as is expected. It never reaches the gross-out levels of something like Day of the Dead, in fact it feels like something that's just a couple snips away from a PG13.So, should you see the Girl with all the Gifts? If some uneven narrative fluctuations and minor gore aren't enough to scare you away from yet another zombie movie, then you're going to receive some unique and powerful gifts from an unforgettable girl!-Josh Evans"
" A Traditional Topic Tone in an Nontraditional Way
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,7,"As someone who is on a zombie-binge, I find that many of the zombie movies out there are one in the same. You can practically write the plot yourself some of them are so predictable.But not this one.This movie has a topic that has been done so many times and twists it with a refreshing spin to it. In this film, the characters actually grew into something; the villain became more brutal and unpersuaded when it came to saving the planet, the young girl came to actually care for those around her, discovering her limits as a zombie, and the ones who were unsure at first come to care for this girl and even allow themselves to understand her setbacks.The beginning of the movie was better than the last half. Some new characters and plots became unnecessary and distracted from the overall meaning to this movie. The ending is a little anticlimactic, if not very. The journey to the end which had built us up so much was very sunshine and rainbows. Something that I enjoyed, but did not like for this particular movie.So do I recommend this movie? Yes, wholeheartedly.
Should you keep an open mind? Absolutely."
" A true triumph for its budget and one of the best zombie movies of all time
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,8,"While the man-eating fungus-body-snatcher-plague is by no means original, the serious portrayal of a zombie apocalypse in The Girl with All the Gifts is one of the best. It's hard to believe they managed to do all they did on screen with such little budget (less than $5 million). The derelict natural-takeover landscapes are stunning and the fungal evolution is otherworldly and interesting. There's some extremely tense moments in this film and it achieves horror without reliance on jump scares or gratuitous gore.All that being said, the film's finale is poorly executed. Did the soldiers just decide to abandon all reason for the sake of wrapping up the plot? The teacher just accepts the near total genocide of the human race after a few tears?In the end, the Girl may be somewhat human, but she is absent of any humanity... And in this case, quite ""literally worse than Hitler."""
" Worth a watch if you're into post apocalyptic films
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,6,"Another zombie apocalypse, worth a watch! Some originality and some of the same old. I've seen a lot of negative reviews about the ending, but I disagree, original ending, not expected.Unfortunately, nothing blew me away, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, and I won't be in a rush to watch it again so hence my 6/10. That being said, I can't point my finger at any overriding negatives!"
" Lots of like, but a very unfortunate ending
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,6,"I was very excited to see a great zombie movie for the first time in a long time, and it was great for the first two-thirds or so. And then it got real silly in the final act.It started with an original concept and great production design, as well as a creepy score. I appreciated the violence--including a brutal approach to household pets--although the CGI gunshot bloodspatter which looked terrible. It's all great, in fact, until some Lord of the Flies nonsense turns up and one of the most laughable final scenes in horror history is offered.--SPOILERS--I actually really appreciated when Melanie set the pods on fired, dooming humanity. I love a great bleak ending. But the wild zombie children were stupid, and got even dumber in the final shot of zombie school. I truly burst out laughing because it was one of the most outlandish things I've ever seen."
" A movie with a lot of good ideas, but nothing to do with them.
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,4,"So, zombie apocalypse. Alright, that's fun. A little overplayed, but fun. Not a virus but a fungus this time, alright, that's pretty cool, and might have more basis in reality, considering there's one that does such a thing with ants. World's been mostly taken over by zombies already, cool. Fungus is starting to sprout pods, which will make the virus airborne, pretty cool. Turns out those pregnant when infected with the fungus will give birth to basically normalish kids that just eat like the zombies. All pretty cool. I have not a single issue with the world building, it's actually really cool, well done, and perfectly put together.Unfortunately, that's the best thing about this movie. I'll not lie, while the world is beautiful, we spend the greatest part of the movie wandering about, collecting snippets of exposition about the world from characters that have little to no personality. When they do the narrative is very sure to stick them in one box and not let them move from it, or, in the case of one character who falls into the most obvious trap, just do as the plot demands. Justineu of course has to be the most saintly character, so everyone else is cruel and heartless by comparison. I honestly can't even remember enough about Melanie to make a statement to her character, and that's definitely a problem. The Sargent a total jerk with no redeeming qualities until the last second because they need him to be. The doctor is evil because we said so. The zombie children are treated like less than dirt for no reason. I understand the need for the chairs and all, but the calling them ""abortions"" was both unnecessary and entirely unbelievable.The acting was flat and more lifeless than the zombies. It was impossible to believe a single tear or even inflection. I could almost imagine the director's exact words with every action and line of dialogue.The plot meanders endlessly to nowhere. It starts off as a consistent ""get to point b"" but we never make it there, and spend over half the film walking, expositing, reminding that Melanie is a zombie.There's more to be said, but I've honestly forgotten at this point. I'll probably forget the entirety of it by the end of the week. Don't really recommend it unless you're one of those rare few who aren't sick of the endless barage of zombie themed media yet.P.S. I shouldn't be able to laugh during tense moments, and the scene with Melanie chasing off the pack of other kid zombies was nothing short of hilarious."
" Certainly an interesting and entertaining movie
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,7,"The plot of this movie is quite believable. It was fun and engaging to watch. The gore is moderate, and director is careful not to show too much at any point. - They all usually make blood unrealistically dark and make dying very fast and quiet, which is very good. Too much gore realism is never good.There are some plot issues with the movie, but who cares. For the budget at hand this move is a marvel."
" Nothing extraordinary
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,6,"Overall a good movie, nothing too special about it. I loved the characters and especially the little girl. Amazing acting but an okay plot. The ending kind of pissed me off but I won't say it's bad. Not everything ends the way you want it."
" I liked this one - a bit on the nose at some parts
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,"I think this was a good movie that dives into some philosophical symbolism, some of it a bit heavy handed but otherwise enjoyable. I don't think it was scary at all. The child actress was a bit stoic some parts but I think she did great, there were some nuances in her character that were acted out quite well."
" Zombies in the Weeds
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,4,"The problem I have with ""The Girl with All the Gifts,"" yet another zombie movie, is that its major distinction isn't compelling, that of getting into the weeds of zombie lore. I've never found that to be of main interest with any monster movie. Others have compared this one to a video game I'm not familiar with, ""The Last of Us,"" which I suspect is telling given that just about every movie based on a game has been poor, and that in my experience video games that draw heavily from movies, including those long cutscenes, are a bore of an adulterated cinematic experience. So, here, we get lots of mumbo jumbo explaining how the zombies work. The main character, too, is a little girl who is taught by a teacher and who otherwise spends most of her time asking basic questions. The bloody action scenes are OK, I suppose, but are few and far between by comparison. The girl wears a variation on Hannibal Lecter's mask, too, which is somewhat amusing given the characters' shared blood lust.The questioning of one's humanity here is half-hearted, and it's questionable whether any commentary on man's relation to the environment was intended with the symbiosis, plants and pod business. Regardless, this would hardly be the first undead flick to be about such subtext. With today's real-world pandemic, too, the blocker gel here reminds me of the use of hand sanitizer, and people are mindful to also keep their physical and social distance from the children. Nevertheless, ""The Girl with All the Gifts"" is too substantively light and technically unremarkable, with a talented cast including Glenn Close largely wasted, to truly distinguish itself from the popular zombie subgenre."
" Not worth the time
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,1,Absolutely one of the worst end of the world movies ever!
" Was great until the end
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,5,How is she supposed to feed her teacher while shes trapped in an air lock? She doomed her teacher from love and compassion from her own kind by isolating her forever. And why would they portray a happy ending? This girl just destroyed everything. I'm sure the teacher had compassion for her but not enough where she would give her the green light on wiping out the human species. It was such a good movie until the end.
" lacking in everything
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,1,"I get the story and how there is symbolism with today's society. It reminded me of 28 days later, which after the movie was over, I said to my friend, ""that was an anti-war movie"". This movie is instead a movie about materialism and consumption. It is about how we are generating new generations of children who are tied to having more possessions, being more tied to technology and out of touch with their humanity.The movie is terrible and there are deus ex machina through out the movie. It feels like I'm being forced through a funnel. Things happen unnaturally. I'm supposed to believe that an adult, who is training/researching these children, is dumb enough to expose their self to a child in such a manner? And why the military didn't just shoot her in the head to get rid of the problem?Going back to 28 days later, the end scene where a bird drops some blood in to the eye of the father and he turns in to a zombie, yawn, boring. That's deus ex machina happening because the writer needs it to happen and it happens in such a ridiculous manner that it makes the movie look cartoonish.Writers these days have lost the art of telling a story to fit a narrative. Profit."
" Good til the end
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,7,"As others have pointed out, movie is pretty enthralling until the last 20 minutes. To put it without major spoilers there are 2 things that really killed the momentum at the end.
1. The ""trap"" that turns into grunt fighting... i get it.. but no thanks. Its awkward and doesnt do anything for the story and instead is just a plot device to fill 10 mins.
2. The ending... for being such a smart girl, she does something completely thoughtless and out of character. Thoughtless on so many levels. Ruins the continuity of the character and thus the story.Unfortunately due to those 2 things an overall good movie will fall into obscurity.As a side note, Im giving it 1 more star than i would have otherwise due to that it was really nice that there were no political undertones in the movie which is rare these days."
" Freah breath into the z genre
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,7,Good one. Not a typical z movie as many suggest. Some of the qs Melanie asks may not make sense in the beginning yet towards the end wait for that particular question it will hit the spot. I have really enjoyed it.
" I've seen better
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,3,"I lost interest halfway through. The plot makes absolutely no sense, and the science is vague at best. There's no character development at all which makes me feel like I'm wasting my time. The film has no resolution which is unsatisfying. Why is it that almost all zombie movies have no ending or answer as to what caused the apocalypse or how it was resolved? Hopefully the book was better. There are way better zombie movies out there. I'd skip this one."
" I have been waiting for a movie like this
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,10,"I'm a huge fan of the Zombie horror genre and lately have been let down. Best original Zombie film since 28 days later, not that I'm an expert. Actors were great,, just excellent in my opinion. It was just what I needed!"
" Top notch thrills
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,8,"I guess one size doesn't fit all. As evidenced by the bad reviews for this gem of a movie. It blends sci-fi with some real thrills and wraps it in a way-above-average zombie movie.
I am a long-time zombie movie lover. Ever since George Romero showed us what a great zombie movie could and should look like. Night of the Living Dead set the bar really high and few movies have made it to that bar, much less over it. I think Romero would have approved of this movie. It makes it to the bar. Unlike another GREAT zombie movie, Train to Busan, The Girl with... relies on a more subtle, but no less effective, risk of imminent danger and demise. It's full of the classic ""oh no, look out behind you"" thrill of the zombie movie and done very effectively. It's not as unrelenting as Train to Busan, but it is very well paced nonetheless.
If you're in the mood for a heart-racing ride and enjoy zombie movies, then this one is well worth your time. Hey... Glenn Close thought it was good enough to be in, so that, too, should say something."
" Fell short
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,5,This could've been a great zombie movie but somehow fell short...
" NO SPOILERS IN FIRST PART OF REVIEW
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,4,"NO SPOILERS:
This movie was really disappointing by the time I finished it. It started strong and felt like it was going to be a good movie, and really was decent throughout, but they dropped the ball on some major continuity and it ultimately felt very unfulfilling, like the filmmakers just didn't really care about it that much. The plot is interesting and somewhat unique, its based upon a book of the same name, which draws uncanny similarities to The Last of Us video game, coincidentally.
In the end it's a decent movie at the core. If you really don't give a damn about anything, and it doesn't bother you when a film contradicts itself in major ways and changes it's mind every other scene, you might like this film. I wanted to like this movie. The roots of the film are great. But the contradictions and blatant lack of attention to detail killed it for me.PLOT/MINOR SPOILERS:
Plot= a fungal pandemic decimates the world and a few military outposts hold out, attempting to create a cure using infected-yet-sentient children as the basis. After a base falls to the horde, a few survivors (including soldiers, a well meaning but apathetic doctor/scientist, and a caring teacher/mother figure to the children) escape along with one of the child subjects, Melanie.
The film follows them as they attempt to reach another military base, learning new things about the infection along the way.Gemma Arterton is in the movie but it didn't really feel like it.
Glenn Close does a good job in her role but it seemed like they really wanted to make her out as a villain at the end, despite her actions being extremely relatable and good natured throughout the film so it didn't make much sense.
Paddy Considine does well as a tough sergeant who has seen the loss all around him
Sennia Nanua plays the role of Melanie, the central character and infected child. At times you can feel her dilemma and sadness that she knows she's a monster and wants to be better. At other times she's alien and tough to understand. Her performance matches her character development, mostly great, but sometimes a little stiff, which may be a consequence of writing rather than acting.MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW
Plot Continued:
It is revealed the children were born after their mothers were infected and thus retain their humanity for the most part. Eventually the survivors come across a tower of spores created by the fungus to spread the infection further and faster than by bodily fluids transfer(bites). After protecting the survivors against other feral hybrids like herself, Melanie decides the world should belong to the new race of symbiotic Fungus/human hybrids and dooms them all by releasing the spores, while also paving the way for a fresh start for her new symbiotic species.The primary problem I have with this film is its terrible consistency. There are points where something is stated, then moments later trashed for the sake of the film to continue. Most importantly, the ending. She just saved the humans, states she wants to help them with a cure and not let them turn into mindless zombies, then suddenly reverses her decision and turns all humans (minus the few she ""saves"" by locking them in a lab). It's shown that the spores will only infect people the standard way, not turn them into the smart hybrids, so essentially shes just killing all of the humans so her race can be the new dominant species. She also says she's protecting the 3 survivors by sealing them in the lab when she goes to release the spores but it was a clear plot point that they had no food in the lab just moments before. However the movie ends hinting that the teacher will be living happily sealed in the lab for an undisclosed amount of time despite this clear lack of food and water. Also, earlier on the soldiers use suppressors on their rifles. At first the suppressors made substantial noise, as in real life, so I figured it would be semi realistic, however in the next scene they fire them literally in the middle of a crowd of sleeping zombies and also fire unsuppressed sidearms as they run away but only a couple zombies wake up, even though it was stated loud noises and fast movements attract them. Melanie smells a cat about 10yds ahead of her and goes full zombie, somehow catching, then eating it, but doesn't smell a dog in the next room and also has no urge to eat it. Then later she goes bloodhound and sniffs down a man who is blocks away. It's also revealed the gel humans use to cover their scent has a scent which doesn't actually repel zombies at all, it just smells a little bad to them and they still track and eat people using it, so in reality it shouldn't have ever worked at all. I could go on and on but my point is, there was no clear direction, they made points then reversed them almost immediately. I've never seen a film with so many contradictions and major continuity errors.
They also leave multiple plot points open which seemed semi important. We see a zombie pushing a stroller, which they identify as clear maternal instinct, something they hadn't seen before, but it goes nowhere after that. They introduce the feral hybrids, using a grunt language with faces painted but we don't learn what any of it means or how they learned it. Also on that note, one of the soldiers falls for the hybrids' clear, cartoon styled trap. They lay cans of food leading to a dark room, which he follows, picking up each can like a 4 year old child, thinking nothing of it. I mean come on."
" A 7-8 Star Zombie Movie - Decent Acting Throughout - Captivating Storyline - Enjoyable
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,8,04/02/2020 Definitely worth watching. The first half is a little slow building the storylines foundation but the later half makes up for it. Recommended. Bon Appetit'
" Surreal and Very well done example of this genre!
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,8,"I was thoroughly impressed by this haunting and well acted movie!
It has a surreal vib and as it opens you see what seems to be innocent children being held and restrained at gunpoint and you wonder what on earth is going on here! Then you quickly understand Why...The lead actor in this, a very young girl, was superb and chilling in her portrayl.. glenn close was fantastic as well..Havent seen her for ages in anything and she brings her formidible acting presence to bear here...This is Not yor usual walking dead zombie drama...not by a long shot...In many ways ,this is a much better done and certainly more intense and gripping than walking dead...The use of very Very haunting and surreal music score helps to set the tone in this very well done, exciting and haunting movie...That music! some of the characteristics of the way the infection shows itself,especially in that opening scene with the restrained children, is bone chilling and unnerving....you will know what I mean when you see and Hear it! Overall, the only thing that felt abit off was the ending..
Was that young woman to spend the rest of her life in isolation because of the plague that was released? Noone could spend their whole life in a trailer, never venturing outside, though I suppose, she Could if she wore a protective suit of had a breathing mask on... either way, a crazy ending! This was a great ride and recommended!"
" Not,.... what I was expecting.
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,4,"After hearing rants and raves of how good this movie was as a Zombie movie (spoiler,.... it's NOT really a zombie movie imo). I felt I had to give it a watch. I was entertained for the first hour, but I'm sure you will be shocked to hear (since NO ONE is talking about the ending,.... j/k) that the ending was rather garbage.The Girl with All the Gifts started out as a movie showcasing a world overrun by ""hungries"" (even their own movie doesn't call them Zombies). Surviving humans are testing on children who ate their way out of the womb apparently. A morbid thought to be honest. So these children are a mix of human and 'hungry', which apparently is all of the pros and none of the cons.As in most typical zombie movies,.... the base is overrun and they're forced out into the wild. Surrounded by enemies they must come to rely on Melanie (the only surviving child from the base) as a scout. After quite a few scenes which didn't honestly need to be there, of Melanie eating living creatures, including cats and pigeons. This,.... I wish I could say there was more to the movie. But this goes on for quite some time with the survivors attempting to get back to a supposed camp Beacon. Which you come to find out is also overrun and evacuating. Then for some reason the Lost Boys from Peter Pan make an appearance,... but that's short lived as a VERY sheltered Melanie assumes command by beating the lead Lost Boy up,... and (as close captioning called it) fiercely growling at the other Lost Boys. Thus saving the survivors, because that's Melanie's food source,.... or something.To be honest,... the ending was extremely disappointing. This had the possibility to be something NEW to the franchise,... But as mentioned by others, literally uses the plot of the video game Last of Us to end the movie. Something that didn't make a lick of sense in the first hour of footage as it was never mentioned a single time.If you have time, give it a watch. If you get it for free even better. But I'd honestly just watch the first hour and then turn it off....."
" The Last of Us
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,8,"Same premise as the video game right down to the ""clicking"" sound they make. Even how the bodies mutate into fungal floral stuff. I guess if you haven't played the video game first it's good but not as good with the slight altercations of factors storyline wise."
" Pollyanna + The Last of Us = this trash
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,1,"Just couldn't get into this. Of course it's a girl of color who is able to do everything and has the special mcguffin to save the day. That is already two SJW brownie points right there.The girl in this was so annoying. She reminded me of Pollyanna. So ridiculously positive and polite for a girl held in captivity her whole life.The characters made stupid decisions throughout the film. No one was likable or interesting. The part with the stare-down and child zombies was more laughable than serious like they probably intended. I felt absolutely zero tension watching this movie. It was so boring. At least this movie didn't seem to shove some kind of political message like an Italian zombie movie I watched last year. Jeez, zombie movies have become such rubbish. I can't wait for this fad to die out.People said the soundtrack was creepy, but some tracks just sounded so weird and annoyingly out of place."
" Very good adaptation.
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,8,"Okay, this is probably going to be one of those 'I just saw the movie recently so my opinion is still ridiculously over-inflated' sort of write-ups, so please bear that in mind.Several years ago, I quit playing videogames but one of the last games that I played was The Last of Us which was an especially impressive post-apocalyptic zombie survival title. As far as gameplay went, it was actually repetitive and boring, but what was great about this particular game, was the heart-warming story and the wonderfully rich environment it created. Most people who played this game all came out of it with the same conclusion, ""This would make a killer movie."" This brought up all of the implications that its film adaptation would certainly end up sucking due to the infamous 'Game to Film' adaptation curse. If you are not familiar, this is the belief, argued by some, that no videogame has been successfully adapted to the screen and resulted in a great film, or at least a commonly acknowledged great film. Ever. Though this film will technically not count, The Girl with All the Gifts borrows a lot of stylistic elements from that game and owes it a great debt but, in the end, it is its own film and I must say, an exceptional one.I am not going to go into any detail about this one yet because I know a lot of you will not have seen it. I went into it blind and I think that doing likewise will add to the experience for everyone. I will say it has some wonderful performances and looks every bit as beautiful as the game I mentioned above. This is top shelf storytelling with painfully gorgeous climax and while watching The Girl with All the Gifts, I was struggling to find anything to compare it to. It is certainly my favorite zombie film made this year, even surpassing the way above averageTrain to Busan . I would have to go back to 28 Days Later to find anything to rival it but I think I might like this even more than that game changer. So then what? Romero's original films? It seems a little unfair to compare it to the genesis of the genre but that is where I'd have to look. Is this the best zombie movie I've ever seen then? I dunno. It is definitely the coolest.In my opinion, if you want zombies done right, you go to the English apparently.28 Days Later/Shaun of the Dead/ The Girl with All the Giftsthey are positively shaming the rest of us"
" Solid Production
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,8,"This is a really well told story that was able to capture me from the beginning., A solid plot with a very good twist on the ""zombie"" genre. The effects were done well and not so over the top that they drowned out the acting. Kudos to the actors for excellent weapons handling, the Trainer/Armorer did well, wish they could have used blanks, but the cg was good. Absolutely loved the ending!!"
" The Critics At It Again!! What They Did See That I Didn't Saw?!
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,3,From filmmaking standpoint it's ok but from story and script standpoint it's the stupidest script ever and this abortion of zombie movie maybe worse than World War Z.
" Not crazy about the ending
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,7,... thus the 7/10... could have been 10/10 if it wasnt bcoz of the ending. Can anyone just tell me how does the teacher survive in the bunker? Without food? Illogical.
" Sci fi horror
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,9,Fantastic horror film. Part of this film was filmed in stoke on trent. Just one of the best films made.
" Heartwarming... No, wait...
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,9,"Uh, okay. Zombie-fungus apocalypse with a girl that, infected as she may be, is very human and may hold a cure for mankind. Mmm... Uh-huh.Part of a military program to save mankind, the research base where a second generation zombie-girl that appears human in lots of respects, is overrun by zombies, infected with a zombie-fungus not unlike the kind that takes over insects, is way more aggressive, and leads to some kind of a symbiosis which rivals any kind of evolutionary, no devolutionary tale in terms of eat and be eaten, because they really eat you alive.Is there a cure? What's the disease? And what does it mean to be human or zombie or neither? Well, the answer I have to give is that everything depicted here is really exciting, completely unexpected, and a bit nasty here and there...I really enjoyed it."
" Yup 10 for plot,originality,acting and cinematography
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,10,"Zombie movie fans this is a great one up there w Rammbock:Berlin Undead , 28 days later, Zombie Diary and yes WWZ but this much better
. A bit of a thinking persons zombie movie but oh so original. Don't worry it's still gory . It centers around a lil girl Melanie who is part of a large group of kids . Not spoiling it but she's like a new evolution of the zombie canon. There are things in this zombie movie that are totally unique. So enjoy because you won't forget this one."
" Little Pollyanna has gone places
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,5,"Though the storyline was quite original, this movie turned out kinda flat.
Too slow, not very thrilling and this over the top friendly girl was like a post apocalyptic half zombie version of little Pollyanna."
" Surprisingly good, fun Indie flick
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,7,"Worth a watch, if you're into similar small-scale zombie flicks (think; The Night Eats The World, and Cargo).Starts slowly but must say the scope improves vastly once the plot progresses and the characters' journey begins to expand.The premise is based around the ""Last of us""-style Cordyceps fungus, as the vector for the ""zombie"" invasion. The (surprisingly impressive) set design clearly pays homage to this, with a little bit of inspiration from Chernobyl thrown in for good measure.I could honestly give or take the subplot, but overall there are some good set pieces and if you're a fan of Z's then this is a good weekend afternoon Netflix pick sort of film to kill some time."
" Clever. Chilling.
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,9,"Low-budget, understated, very British. And clever. Very, very clever. And chilling. And clever."
" Great movie based on real, weird nature!
",2019-10-18 00:00:00,8,"Based on the almost Cthulu-esque Cordyceps Fungus, this disquieting movie transcends the mere zombie-flick.With solid performances for all involved and starring the old Hanley (Stoke-on-Trent) bus station, this story, for me certainly, was all the creepier because it is based on Cordyceps. After watching the movie I'd urge you to go to YouTube and take a look at a few of the nature shorts - does to be creeped out a bit further :)As usual with zombie movies, lots of promptings about the self, what it means to be human etc."
" Fun fungal funeral
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,7,"Definitely a different take on the zombie apocalypse. Some very cool concepts, amazing set design, and some good acting performances.The child gang didn't work for me but overall a pretty good zombie movie!"
" The Last of us movie?
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,7,"Even though the zombie genre has been overly done and rewritten multiple times the last few years, this movie has a unic and a surprising new way of doing it.
The first hour is just stunningly made and from the very start this movie catches you like no other zombie movie does, no cliches but just new concept, very interesting, shocking and very creepy...The imagery of the post apocalyptic world is the finest of any zombie movie I've seen, just beautiful (basically very very much like the Last of Us video game). The movie starts very strong and keeps you interested all the way, but the last 30 minutes I cant but think that did the writer&director change or did they not realise to have ruined the movie with such an ending? Anyways, worth a watch.(Ps. The soundtrack/audio is very creepy, be warned..)"
" A bit flat, not scary
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,4,"This was a strange movie. There were some nice touches but all in all it missed on many levels. A great cast who just seemed like they were going through the motions on this one, all really wooden. The girl I actually going very annoying. The worst bit was a laughable fight the girl has with a rival boy. So badly choreographed. The ending didn't do it for me. Love Zombies and apocalyptic movies but this really flat and kind of boring."
" Worst movie I've ever seen!
",2019-09-18 00:00:00,1,Don't watch! Redicilous from start to end. No real story. Annoying as hell kid the whole way through. Some great actors from other movies in this film and I am disappointed they signed up to be in the girl with all.... what was it called again?.
" Trippy and amazing
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,7,Slow kind of suspense but is a real must watch! Found myself saying WTH!!! Don't do this...don't do that. It really evoked alot of emotion.
" Not sure what everyone else was watching
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,2,"I love a good zombie movie and budget productions have never really bothered me but this really had nothing to offer. Neither a decent zombie movie nor a good drama. It starts very very slowly, followed by a very long and drawn out intro. Pretty predictable even as to the order in which everyone dies !A budget production, weak acting and a poor plot-unclear messages, gaps in the story line, poor editing and disappointing effects. This production is too bad to even earn itself a cult following."
" I'm hunger but not for this
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,3,"The Girl with all the Gifts.. Infected population with ""zombie"" virus. Young girl may be a carrier of a neutralising gene. A squad of soldiers have to protect her. Think of 28 days later .... but with a sillier storyline. That's the film for you . 3/10"
" Zombie mushrooms
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,6,"Having the zombie disease spread as a Fungus is the main innovation of this film, but apart from the themes are similar - human zombie hybrid who may save the world; mad scientist willing to sacrifice everyone and everything to find the cure, military using dubious methods to control the infection. But that makes it sound quite generic, when actually there is a lot more going on here. This is one of the genres ""quiet"" zombie films where frenetic action and fighting for survival are not the main drivers of the film, but more an exploration of the central characters journey. The main character - one of the the afore-mentioned hybrids - is both terrifying, but also childishly disarming, with a cold logical approach to the situation, mixed with a child like playfullness. its well done, and well acted, and is a slow burner which will stay with you longer than some of the all action forggetable zombie films."
" Excellent movie that stays with you
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,10,"I adored this movie, the child lead especially! Going into thjs film knowing nothing about it, was perfect! Everything from the story, to the actors, to the effects was amazing. Highly recommend this, if you haven't seen it!"
" One of the most interesting zombie movies I've ever seen
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,8,"I am not into zombie movies what so ever I often feel it was a waste of my time watching zombie movies, Except for this one. This one was different, the concept of a symbiotic relationship between the zombie parasite and a person I find super interesting and unlike any other zombie movie I've ever seen.And the way it ended was amazing in my opinion, Millatti's choice to turn the world into generation two zombies makes much more sense than a vaccine in my opinion. Many zombie movies focus on finding a vaccine or some sort of treatment. To me that is unrealistic how are the supposed to cure the entire world when the entire world is still trying to kill them. Where in the sense of this film they say the majority of the world just not in the benefit of humans.The cinematography and the shots in this film are also amazing. Along with the editing, the editing kept me on edge the entire time they did an amazing job keeping the suspense.I'm not sure if this film was filmed on location or if it was all green screen but either way I could not tell. Because I couldn't tell amazes me because of it was filmed on location set design would've been unbelievably difficult but if it was green screen then the VFX artist was absolutely amazing.All in all I would give this movie a very high rating in comparison to any other zombie movie I've seen. I would definitely recommend watching it even if you are not a zombie movie fan."
" Not bad
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,6,"It is a good movie, but my god the ending pisses me off. I could follow the story and loved the ""why do I have to die for you to live."" But did she really need to screw over the girl who helped her. She is now stuck in that thing, alone, forever. The little girl didn't need to set that thing on fire and make it airborne. The survivors were already falling apart like the doctor said. the poor teacher is now teaching forever, and can never fall in love, or hold someone. It just seemed like a stupid ending. ""I wanna live."" Okay great, ""but lets take humans down while we are at it.""
Like no, we need the message that humans can't decided who deserves to live, not one deserves to live and the other doesn't. Harmony. If she didn't make it airborne, maybe harmony could have resulted through her."
" Original, uncompromising and grim
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,7,"Certainly not your typical cliched zombie flick, it pulls no punches, is well acted and tells a well paced story with a good premise. Thoughtful portrayal of humanity. A movie with well thought-out ideas and integrity. The first 20 minutes is absolutely compelling, the rest ... not exactly a feel-good movie, but unflinchingly remaining true to its foundational ideas. Strong characters, superb music and great potrayal of overgrown post-apocalypyse city."
" Nice take on The Bodysnatchers, and the (evolved) zombie genre
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,7,"Cargo and Patient Zero already proved that the zombie genre isn't dead and buried. It just needed to be reinvented and evolved. And so the genre did, or even better: the zombies.Zombies are less presented as mindless monsters and more as an inevitable next step in the evolution and an integral part of a not too distant future. And so we have a brilliantly portrayed Melanie, who is infected, but very intelligent and able to know love, friendship and trust as she bonds with a group of human survivors trying one last time for a cure.We live in a world that is decided by the choices that humans make. This movie makes that obviously clear, without becoming over dramatic and it keeps its entertainment value as a horror drama movie."
" I don't want to be a hungry
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,8,"If you are familiar with the seminal Playstation game ""The Last of Us"", then you will find many similarities between it and this little gem of a film. Both have a very similar premise and share many of the same ideas. That said, there are also very significant differences in story and perspective.Made on a shoestring budget, yet able to command the performances of famous faces such as Glenn Close, this is is a film that is as thought provoking as it is entertaining.The big spoiler is this... what if the zombie outbreak were the next step in our evolution and a war that humanity should lose? That's the question that this film poses so brilliantly.With excellent performances throughout, this is a must-see for fans of science fiction and dystopian dramas such as Children of Men. A typical popcorn horror movie it most definitely isn't."
" my notes
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,4,"There really wasn't anything i thought was bad about this movie. it just couldn't keep me invested. some of it is really good, like a long one-take scene. but overall it felt more like a straight to dvd movie. some cool scenes and dark moments early on, but it just fizzles into boredom (1 viewing)"
" Truly original Zombie film.
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,9,"The Girl With All The Gifts: Its years after the Zombie Apocalypse, isolated pockets of humanity survive. At an army base, children who survived zombie mothers deaths when they were near term are experimental subjects. They are subject to Zombiesque behaviour, having a habit of biting people. Their intelligence tested but they are also subject to vivisection. When the base is overrun by Zombies a few soldiers, a doctor, a teacher and a girl zombie who appears to be the most human of the children escape and make their way through a ruined London, overgrown with vegetation.Truly original Zombie film.The infection is due to a fungal infection which effectively controls the host. It is spread through bodily fluids, a bite or even a blood spatter is enough to infect. The dead don't rise however. Some rather gruesome scenes. But I was more upset at the cat being eaten than the people! And I think some if the scenes were shot in Catford, I reckon I recognise a mall. 9/10"
" Amateur Trash. Below the Barrel Material and Performance. Read on if you're brave.
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,1,"After The Walking Soap Opera (AMC The Walking Joke) everybody and their mother has started making ""zombie"" movies. Now we have this. Girl with Gifts. What the hell does that mean? So the twist in this one is that the fungal disease is turning people into zombies, and there are a few babies born of zombie mothers, who are conscious and mostly normal until they get hungry for human flesh.We have a military base full of non-actors, including Glenn Close, and other losers, including the ""cute"" Sennia Nanua playing a young girl half zombie. Close plays a scientist looking for a cure, looking to sacrifice Nanua for the cure. Gemma Arterton plays Nanua's teacher. All the actors here are garbage. Their dialogue is trash. The scenes are garbage. The story is garbage. Everybody except for Gemma treats these young half zombies as things. Nanua is overly polite, and it's just unbelievable. These children were brought up in isolation and have perfect British accents. How does that work? The world is going to hell, and everybody is just plain calm. The soldiers are stupid. There's no plan to keep the base safe. It's overrun by zombies. Really ridiculous scene. Nanua kills two soldiers, face all bloody, Gemma protects her. It just makes no sense.They handcuff Nanau, with a bloody face and shirt, they put a see through mask so she won't bite anybody, then they tie her to the top of the vehicle. The color schemes are ridiculous. Green all around, and their wearing green outfits. Nice try. When they stop at a river or lake for water, Gemma punches Close, just to let her know she's pissed off. Who writes this stuff. One of the soldiers forgets to put the silencer on, gets bitten and shoots out the gas tank of their stupid vehicle. Then our heroes hike to London and find a mobile lab, then discover a huge fungal growth. Ohh, it's just too stupid to continue.This film is garbage. I hate the acting. It's boring. Copy and Paste from better movies. Original? No. Shoot the zombies in the head and they die, same old stuff.Here's a quick history of zombie movies. White Zombie, 1932, Bela Lugosi's best movie. Check it out for true dread. Next, Last Man on Earth, 1964, Vincent Price. Dread all around. Check out the scene with Price and his sick daughter. Night of the Living Dead, 1968. Best Romero Film Ever. They're coming to get you Barbara. Barbara portrays terror. Incredible film. Messiah of Evil, 1972. This is some twisted film.I'm not a fan of Dawn of the Dead. The beginning of the film is the best, with the TV Station and the apartment building. Great stuff. Then they get to the mall and it turns into a comic joke. The actors are garbage, we have a dumb motorcycle gang, and zombies with pie in the face with loony tunes playing in the background. Shut it off after the first 15 minutes.Day of the Dead, now that was a great film. Not as great as Night, but still had some great ideas and scenes.The Walking Dead, is a soap opera. It's about feelings, noting more than feelings. It is The Walking Soap Opera. Inconsistent Characters, experienced survivors doing dumb things. Forget about Fear The Walking Soap Opera. Now these fools are out trying to save the world.People, check out White Zombie, Last Man on Earth, Night of the Living Dead, Messiah of Evil. I'm looking for plausibility.
Gifted Girl is garbage."
" An Original Movie
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,8,I liked the originalality of this movie. The relationship between the student and the teacher added depth to this movie.
" Brilliant
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,8,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film. It hits on your emotions and the girl did remind me a tad of Seven out of Stranger Things at times.
Would recommend it if you like this type of genre."
" Mostly great until the writing changes
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,7,Come on guys. Over 2 hours of greatness then tou decide to go against all of the law and logic you established in this world and turn characyers into complete morons??? Why did you ruin such a good movie?!
" It stands out from the crowd.
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,8,"Initially I wasn't wowed by this film, but as it develops, and opens up, it becomes a really rather good film.It is incredibly visual, there are some amazing scenes throughout, including the old BT tower covered in greenery, and the run down shop fronts.The best element of this film is definitely Glenn Close, her presence definitely elevates the film. Anna Maria Marinca is terrific and terrifying as a zombie.It isn't wonderfully original, a story that has been told hundreds of time, but it's so well made, so visual, and so well acted, that it's overall a very good film. 8/10"
" Superior zombie apocalypse.
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,7,"Very similar to 28 Days later, World War Z etc, but has an intelligent script and great cast which lifts it above most of this overdone genres competition."
" Reminiscient of 28 Days Later
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,9,"In 2002 ""28 Days Later"" was released. A groundbreaking British zombie film. ""The Girl With All The Gifts"" is s British zombie film for a new generation and every bit as good. The acting is amazing. The girl who plays Melanie can hold her own next to Glenn Close and Paddy Considine. The plot is good and keeps the tension going throughout. I haven't watched to end yet. Still 20 minutes to go but I can tell the ending will be good so if this is your sort of thing. Watch it. You won't regret it ðŸ˜Š"
" Read the book first
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,7,"I've read the book and also the second ""the boy on the bridge"" and only found later that it was made into a motion picture. Having enjoyed the books so much I was curious to see whether the movie followed the same storyine, character descriptions, etc...Having read the story first I was a bit disappointed with the film. The film is still great but you won't get the whole story in a film. It would have been better done if it was released as 10 episodes or something.I'm still giving 7 stars as it was still good to watch."
" Different approach to Dystopia/zombie
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,10,"I loved it!!! The actors, the plot, ending, everything!! Definitely a good watch imo. Noted I'm not a professional movie critic, just a movie lover of all kinds :)"
" A pretty great INFECTION film
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,8,"They're not zombies, their infected. Like how 28 Days Later is an infection film (rage virus). The fungus doesn't reanimate the dead and their not decomposing. Just saying ;)That being said, this movie is almost a complete ripoff of The Last of Us (2013). Which is pretty much my main gripe but if you don't know that game (your loss!) then this film will feel even more fresh and better written.Otherwise, acting is really good, got a decent score, the first 45min is easily the best of the film, then characters start to make dumb decisions. Wish a couple characters were more fleshed out, the rules about the infected (particularly Melanie) isn't always clear or seem to matter/change when plot needs it, and could've used some more scare. I liked the ending, though some may be divided by it."
" Interesting, but not as compelling as the book
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,6,"Written by Mike (M.R.) Carey concurrently with his 2014 novel of the same name, The Girl with All the Gifts presents as a highlights version of its sister book. The film is well acted and comptently made, combining computer simulations of post-apocalyptic landscapes with physical sets, a moving camera, and practical horror effects for an overall realistic feel. However, the complexity of the plot and premise allows little time for a deep exploration of the central characters, resulting in a movie that is eerie and conceptually interesting but lacks the heart and poignancy of the novel."
" An incredible surprise.
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Everything here was spot on, the acting, the originality, the writing. This is a standout in the zombie apocalypse genre in the vein of 28 Days Later and World War Z."
" Novel zombie outing
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,6,"THE GIRL WITH ALL THE GIFTS is a relatively novel zombie film, made on a relatively low budget in British with an ensemble cast. The post-apocalyptic world is envisaged very well, with location shooting in Chernobyl adding to the dilapidated look of the surroundings; I particularly liked the way that nature has reclaimed many of the buildings here.The story itself is based on a novel and explores a world in which young child are the carriers of the zombie virus and regularly transform into zombies themselves, while at the same time retaining their intelligence and humanity. Sennia Nanua, in the titular role, delivers a fine performance and is well supported by Glenn Close, Paddy Considine and Gemma Arterton, all of whom are fine. The film's twists on the usual zombie shenanigans keep you watching, although things do fizzle out towards the end and we finish on something of a damp squib."
" Too subtle to be blended in action I guess
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,6,"When I was watching this film, I keep repeat this thought to stay, because many comments told the film is good. I am not quite sold by the verdict, it's good in aspect of the concept, but in the aspects of how the characters are developed, this film clearly wants to achieve many things at once, because I felt that I failed to grasp the subtle meaning of the characters' actions.In one side, the concept of zombie in this film is well-written and good enough to keep asking the nature of the zombie cause. And the action scenes were good also. But, the climax has many stupid decisions that can't be explained if you dig it deep enough by read the book review/comparison, or maybe the book. The characters clearly good on its own, but making confusing decision have to be created in a sense that, the plot has develop the reason why. This film failed at that and makes me feel guilty to know that I am not join the bandwagon.Probably me who is not focus enough to the details."
" Order Out Of Chaos, anyone??
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,6,"Lo, it is as you say -- except, I think you missed something.First, imho, one can indeed expect Hollywood to insert one of its various NWO-agenda-driven messages into almost any film. In this case, the deftly smuggled message was finally revealed, when the girl answers the ""well meaning"" doctor, when essentially asked to.. lie down quietly and let me carve you up, so all us regular folk can have a vaccine.
At this irresistible invitation, zombie girl says something like, ""Are we not all alive?"" .., to which nifty premise the doctor readily agrees, only to be surprised to hear zombie girl reply, ""Well then, who says WE should die for YOU.??"" exit stage left.If you've gathered my point is coming 'round to Race, you're correct. And one could even claim corroboration of my assessment, in the the reversal of races from book to movie.. vis a vis zombie girl and her beloved teacher.In short, the message (if not the movie) is an invitation to a rebellion -- as in.. ""enough already""; let's put the master class in the cage for awhile, and see how they like it.
(In this sense, the movie reminded me of Gangs Of New York, and the riot that eventually spilled into a cozy setting of a wealthy family's Christmas dinner.)I'm also tempted to impart symbolism to the burning (down) of the seed pod tree; I just wish I knew the specific building the vines were overwhelming, and whether or not it might indeed symbolize, say, white colonialistic mentality."
" Hooked within the first 10 minutes!!
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,9,"I'm critical, extremely technical (fact or fiction)and a hard to please avid movie fan, and I'm not kidding when I say I was standing about 3 feet from my tv close to 20 minutes into a ""post Apocalyptic zombie flick""......And I am definitely not a zombie flick fan. This was one of the best movies I've seen in the past three years, I highly recommend it!!!"
" Love this movie
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,10,"Great apocalyptic landscape. Infected are fast. I knew almost nothing about the story, and loved it (kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole movie - minus the first few minutes). Only small minus point is the fighting behavior of some of the survivors - but that's something you can say about all movies in this genre."
" This starts off brilliantly but soon degenerates into just another monster movie.
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,6,"More dystopian futures, more post-apocalypses and more pro-feminist takes on a genre long dominated by men. This sci-fi/zombie movie seems at first glance just more of the same old same old but with women as the strong dominant characters while the men all act in the same dumb way that men act in all movies of this kind but the premiss is original while Colm McCarthy's direction and the performances of a fine cast, including the always reliable Glenn Close, are a cut above the norm.Unfortunately. once the zombies go on the rampage the picture quickly degenerates into just another monster movie with all the cliches we have come to expect from films of this kind which is a pity since it starts off quite brilliantly. Still, fans of the genre should get a kick from all the blood and gore and visually it is never less than impressive."
" Pretty good.
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,7,I like the child zombie hybrid idea and the crazy place they go with it. I won't watch it a second time but I enjoyed my first viewing.
" Cordyceps and Zombies... nice!
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,8,"So I'm not a gamer but I familiar with the game, ""Last of Us"" and I've also been familiar with the REAL fungus called Cordyceps and the horrible things it does to insect colonies such as Ants. So if you have time - check it out on YouTube, Sir David Attenborough does an amazing segment on the fungus!So when I found out soon after starting this movie that the fall of humanity was all because of the cordyceps fungus - I was very intrigued.I'm giving it a rating of an 8 just for purely that the film used a real life inspiration from our natural world and twisting it into an infectious and dangerous zombie story.In regards to the story itself, I feel like this was best suited to be a teen horror, but I feel adults will appreciate this as an under the radar classic. Acting, locations, and movement of the film felt right and bold, minus the crazy, Feral Children that you will see later on.Scare factor: (5 out of 10)Think of this film not of a coming of age for the main actress, Sennia Nanua (Melanie) but coming to the acceptance of one's zombiesque status and the choices she has to make for her human companions."
" Cringeworthy and stupid!
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,1,"This has to be one of the worst post-apocalyptic zombie movies ever made.The story made absolutely no sense, from the beginning to the end. Watching this movie made my IQ drop by 20 points. It's so daft and cringy! The ending was a complete joke!I'm not going to sit here and reveal too much but unfortunately there were simply too many plot holes that inevitably ruined the whole movie for me."
" Very boring and the ending doesn't make up for it.
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,1,There's one entertaining part in this movie and that's a short scene when the zombie apocalypse breaks out. Other than that it's extremely uneventful with a terrible ending. Don't waste your time.
" Boring, contrived, bad morals...something's off
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,3,"Casting directors have to know that if a kid can't act, even if you think they are cute, the audience is going to hate the film. And find it boring. I refuse to believe there are not kids out there that can act and come across on screen, that are diverse, and smart and willing to work. If it's not the kid's fault, then it's the director, I just can't figure it out. But like I did with ""don't do it, Lyra!"" kids in The Golden Compass, I fell asleep twice! because the kid just broke the fourth wall over and over. Added to that the terrible bland and predictable storyline (what a surprise, the black soldier dies first) and the horrible mix of morals for the kid to eat a cat and sacrifice a dog, I didn't know who this film was for. Kids? Nope. Unless you want your kid saying ""friggin' abortion"" for days after. Adults? Nope. Too dull and contrived. Teenagers? Nope. No eye candy or love interests. Just all out plod,plod, action, plod. It's like those baaad episodes of Walking Dead after Glen died. All I can surmise is that given the attachment of Glenn Close (ha, another Glen dying onscreen) this screenplay at some point was amazing, and had its heart ripped out by someone. But then we're told the author wrote it. And it seems like every other zombie thing. I'm confused how this film got so much attention. It's really something that need not exist, and actually made me feel depressed because it was so bad, plus it has horrible moods to it. Plus the plot makes no sense...if it's really been twenty years, how did the dog turn up in his house? How did the man in the hospital only now start eating his own arm? Why would no spores in all that time have been burned out somehow? Fungus is airborne anyway, so it HAD spores already...makes no sense..."
" **SPOILS THE ENDING!! **
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,3,"Was quite excited to watch this one.
First of all it did not live up to the description, ""zombie movie."" The dead are a minor distraction for the characters, although they are the purpose for every action and interaction. A huge let down the audience couldn't have seen more of this side.Secondly, although the ending was unique, it was a massive let down. The self-righteous main character believes that she is good (a flesh eating zombie who kills several times for her own hunger) and that humans (the ones who kept her alive and who are trying to save mankind) are bad, so kills every living being on the planet (how ironic, seeing as she's so wonderful) to punish them!Plus side: British cinema, British actors. Good acting all round."
" A great start, but ending in a wastly predictable and boring Z-like-all-others movie
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,6,"The start of this story is really interesting and different from other zombie stories. Of cause only 30 mins it goes like ALL other zombiefilms, and really, really, REALLY predictably carries on until the, extremely predictable, end.Anyone who didn't see the end comming must be on drugs or not have followed the storyline at all.And anyone who wrote the ending must not have read the storyline up until then, as it litterally means: in 1 day everyone is dead..."
" Just another corny Brit attempt at zombies
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,1,"Just another corny Brit attempt at zombies, complete with the underwhelming acting and sacrifice of actual action in favor of supposed ""drama."" Give me a break. I should've known to turn it off the moment I heard the accents."
" Good enough
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,8,"On my first watch, I think that the movie was very good in getting me to care a lot about the main characters, specifically Melanie, Miss Justineau and the kind of relationship that they had with each other. They were able to do this because they spent a considerable amount of time showing the audience the dynamics of their relationship in the first 20 minutes of the movie, which is something that I don't see a lot of ""zombie"" movies do (let's face it, even though they passed off these zombies as a fungal infection, it is still a zombie movie).And I have got to applaud this movie for showing the restraint to give more emphasis to the relationships of the characters rather than to exposition and setting up the world that they are living in (at the start). This is another positive for this film because unlike most movies in the zombie genre that have five to ten minutes of exposition at the beginning, this movie just gives us breadcrumbs or clues as to what kind of world they are living in, and who these children are scattered throughout the movie. And I really like that they did that.Through the several suspenseful scenes in the movie, I could feel my heart racing because I had gotten to care about these characters (mainly Melanie, and Miss Justineau in the beginning and the rest as the story went on) and I knew that one wrong move and they would end up dead or infected.The story isn't refreshingly original because there are similarities between the movie and a video game that I played, as well as with one recent zombie movie. But what differs in this film is the execution and the focus on the characters. I was puzzled at the ending after I first watched it because it didn't seem to make sense to me but upon thinking about the movie more and thinking of this movie as Melanie's story, I understood.Now, the bad. Upon watching a second time, there were several events in the movie where I wondered why these things happened the way they did? Why were the infected waking up one at a time when they were going through the horde in London? Why did Melanie get hungry faster after eating a whole cat rather than after eating two bites of human the previous day? Why does Dr. Cauldwell believe that Melanie is the key and why does she only start trying to produce a vaccine after all this time?There were other questions but they could just be attributed to human error. I guess having questions like these were the result of the movie being character-focused rather than exposition-focused. And as viewers of this movie, we're just supposed to accept the events in the movie as how they are without asking questions. For movie-goers who are very logical, like to think, and ask a lot of questions, there are several instances where this movie does this and can provide no concrete answers.However, other than these inconsistencies, I found the movie very enjoyable and would still advise people to watch this movie because of its character-driven approach to the zombie movie genre."
" Its SOOOO good !
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,10,"People that are writing that this movie is slow, are right!
it is slow and i think its delibirate.
it has a slow build, it takes its time and gives us people to care about,
is that a bad thing? i dont think so.
i loved the pacing of the movie it keeps you in a constant state of suspence without the jumpscares.And it has something to say! nature is eventuelly going to bite back, but it does not forcefeed you propaganda its just, a new and inventive way to breathe life into a pretty stuffed market of strait to dvd do it by the numbers zombie movies.Se it its is soo very vary good"

" A well acted rip off
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,4,"The acting was great by all, right down to the child actor. The cinematography was great with close attention paid to the color palate but overall, it is essentially a rip off of the video game ""The Last of Us"" right down to the cause of the infection, the look of the infected and how the infection evolves. But, the game was more emotionally gripping. A fun watch for a day when there is nothing to do and you want to just see something you've never heard of, maybe even if you want to see something out of the norm. But that's about it."
" Like another zombie movie, but the ending got my mouth opened
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,8,"The movie is good. Interesting concept from the beginning, making me want to watch it. The concept of the film is like Maze Runner. There is scientist named Caldwell (pretty much Ava Paige version), who want to make vaccine from children's brains and spines. (The children are special, like in Maze Runner also, but they are a hybrid between human and zombies)And there is one of the experimental children, named Melanie, whom I loved from the beginning, until she starts eating my most beloved animal, cat.But it's okay, I still be able to love her. She is lovely, kind of smart-sociable daughter material.She is curious about anything. She wants to protect all the people she loves (although it is one-sided love :"")Until, the ending come closer.She suddenly feels unfair about the sacrifice she is about to make (letting her be a vaccine of the desease), because she is alive, just like human. Why should her die just to let human live?So, she lock up the people she loves in the ""jail"", and open the spores into the air, making all who breath become zombies.The end of the story concludes that Melanie who is in charge now. She ends the humanity, making people she loves into prisoner.And all she knows is that she do the right thing."
" The Last of Us... Sorta
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,8,"Fans of Naughty Dog's top rated game ""The Last of Us"" have long awaited the film adaptation. Sadly, it's staled in mindless development hell for over two and a half years. At one point Sam Raimi was attached to the film but then the rights were sold to SONY and now... in limbo.The game's writer Neil Druckmann, (who also wrote the script for the possible film) said that, ""Maybe there's something that could be done in the world, either focusing on other characters or other time."" But that he didn't want his characters or script filmed.Well he got his wish.The Girl with All the GiftsIt has the same look as the game, same new fungus zombies, adding in a lovely British ""Rage"" version, a.k.a ""28 Days"", and foremost... a female lead infected but able to control the virus. Not bad. Like it.Bashers will be, but the story is solid, acting spot on and, Sennia Nanua is incredible. A highly enjoyable film. Not perfect, but not a Wal-fart CD bin.8/10"
" Despite a few flaws, a nearly perfect film.
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,9,"I didn't come into ""The Girl With All the Gifts"" with a high expectancy of greatness. In fact, I didn't even know Glenn Close was in it. Nevertheless, it was worth the experience.What I liked most about this flick was the direction. It's approach from a different angle of the zombie trope was interesting. Just when you thought that the zombie efforts were exhausted to death, ""The Girl With All the Gifts"" comes along to portray a new angle. Yes, this movie is grotesque and violent, just like all zombie movies should, but it does have a bit of humanity when it comes to some of the characterizations. Recommended? Certainly. If you're a fan of ""The Walking Dead"", however, you'll say, ""Meh, I've seen this all before."" Still, it's worthy of your time just for the original angle it presents."
" Worth watching
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,8,Finished the new movie The Girl With All the Gifts. The film is a post apocalyptice zombie thriller. It had a surprisingly new take on the zombie mythos. The movie was great overall! The gore was solid and the movie did a great job creating suspense. I really enjoyed watching this movie of many levels. A must watch for zombie fans! 8 out of 10.

A cool zombie movie that doesn't do the same thing every other zombie movie does, ok except for, you know, a virus, apocalypse, military base being overrun, and a group of survivors being killed off one by one, and of course zombies, but in this they're called 'Hungries'. This one however has Glenn Close, no more boiling bunnies for her, its time now to experiment on children!! So, in this ZombiVerse, its been quite some time since the virus appeared turned people into flesh eating monsters, and it focuses on a military base and scientific studies on children who were born to mothers after the infection, and in fact, they all ate their way out of the womb, creepy right?? Strange thing is, the second generation of Hungries are, well, normal, they think, they learn, and when given the chance they will eat your face off on instinct. So as the base is overrun a few military personnel escape along with a couple scientists with their star zombie pupil Melanie, to find help and to survive. And out in the world, the virus is evolving, and it might just be Melanie's time to shine! I really liked it, kept true to the zombie genre, and introduced a slightly new twist, well, I hadn't seen before... I mean there was the mall zombie baby in Dawn of the Dead...but... I dunno...

" Well thought and produced
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,7,"Another zombie movie. Well, the sameness is running out. Here we have an original story that is more intelligent all around. A bit of invasion of the body snatchers to make the natural history of the disease make sense. Flaws are rare."
" Zombie film, but sci-fi, not stupid horror
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,8,"Usually zombie movies are about stupid people trying to survive while even more stupid zombies try to eat them. This is more like a sci-fi invasion movie, with well sketched out characters, a story and an end twist. I quite enjoyed it. The cast is also good, with great acting from all of them. The interesting ending also lends well to a sequel or even a series, although that would probably be too weird to ever do properly.Bonus points: if Naomi from The Expanse ever annoyed you, here is where you can watch her die."
" An intense horror drama with memorable characters and thoughtful dialogues
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,9,"The movie is worth repeated viewing, because it not only delivers terrifying (and gory) fight for survival scenes; as the story unfolds, I appreciate the different perspectives of each character. Koodos to the cast and good chemistry, especially the genuine bond between the school teacher and the hybrid / half human ""hungry"" girl, Melanie. There are many dialogues and fight / flight situations that challenged or changed the characters' view about each other: what defines a human, and more importantly, humanity. The pace and atmosphere effectively alternate between eerie suspense, shocking violence, and brief, contemplative dialogues. The action scenes in this movie reminded me of the frentic atmosphere in 28 Days later; and the interactions between the infected ""hungries"" and the non-infected characters reminded me of the pathos and moral dilemma presented in District 9. When there is an out-break, there really isn't a line between ""us"" and ""them"". We're all in the same boat, depending on the situation."
" Incredible
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,10,"With so much cgi crap out there it's great when something original and unsettling comes out, the little girl and Gemma Arterton are particularly great a must see"
" What a unique flick..
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,7,"The Girl With All The Gifts - This pulled me in just from the imagery of the muzzle alone. I immediately thought of Fido and hoped for another good film with a unique approach to the undead. I got what I was hoping for, and then some. This is not a zombie flick filled with action or even that much gore, but the character development, the post-apocalyptic world, and characters are all worth checking out."
" Good
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,10,Really good. Good good good. Really Really good. Good good good.
" There's an actual ending!
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,10,"To be straight with you from the beginning, I like bad horror movies. I was looking for a cheesy zombie movie, and this was far better than I expected. It's not the greatest film of our time or meaningful in any socio-political sense, but as far as the zombie/horror genre goes, it was top class.
Part of the fun was not knowing what was happening the whole movie and finding out along the way. In that respect, I won't give anything away, but I will say it had an interesting idea for the whole zombie apocalypse story-line that's been done a thousand times, and it had an actual satisfying ending. The acting was great, the characters each had their own personalities and styles. 
This is a fun watch. It's not particularly gory and doesn't rely on jump scares. It's not close ups of hot chicks with guns or random sex scenes. The whole movie was able to rely on an actual story and an actual perspective. And, a rare trait in the genre, it actually has an ending that isn't just death and explosions. If you're a horror fan and want one movie that outside of the cliches, this is a great choice."
" Just another zombie movie
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,3,"This movie is overhyped and the only originality is that the zombie is a little girl. Not sure why anybody would fall for something simplistic like that. The scientist is a cold hearted and irrational person, as always, The army is of course as always simple and mean. For some reason they put a mother figure in the movie who seems to think she lives in a suburban town, not in a post apocalyptic doomsday world. The zombie girl is a supergirl and far to kind for a traumatized zombie girl, maybe a jezus zombie child or something. So turn your brain of and watch this movie or find a better one to watch."
" Rubbish
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,5,"I got that the movie was trying to say it is more sophisticated than the average zombie movie, but for me it was nothing but rubbish"
" A different take, overall great watch
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,8,"Not perfect, but enjoyable for sure if this is your genre it will tick all of your boxes. Apparently doesn't stick to the book. but original and worth a watch"
" Expect the unexpected - a clever movie!
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,9,"This little gem of a movie from Scottish director Colm McCarthy, with screenplay by the author of the original book, MR Carey, is a clever and engaging film defying categorisation- it is at once a science fiction thriller, another a horror film and at other times a futuristic parable of the human spirit and its failings.
The production values are top notch and it goes in directions you might not think it would.
The entire piece is held together by the very wise casting of its young lead- a truly remarkable and nuanced performance by Sennia Nanua. Her acting throughout is a joy to behold and right up until the very last frame you don't know if she is hero or villain, or shades of both. That is quite a skill for such a young actor to pull off.
The rest of the cast is generally very good and believable, especially Gemma Arterton, who plays a pivotal role and whose relationship with the child is the hook on which the tension swings. Glen Close seems to me to be mis-cast here. It's not a huge distraction but her delivery (and, to be fair, some of her lines were a bit ridiculous and would be hard for anyone to deliver with credibility) verged on the corny at times. It needed a star of the quality of Helen Mirren or Tilda Swinton to give it the necessary gravitas that it deserves and would have earned a ten star rating. But it's a solid 9.
Don't let the subject matter turn you off watching this- it is much more than a simple science fiction film. It has heart and soul running through its infected little veins (joke) and could stand proudly alongside the best SF movies.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
" Different Enough
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,7,"This movie is best going into with as little fore knowledge as possible, because when someone tells you the genre of this movie, your preconceptions will almost certainly skew your expectations and experience.This is not a typical movie in its genre. It's a lot smarter and more thought provoking. While there are thrills, and lots of suspense, it's done in a much better way that is of service to the characters and the story, creating a slow build of dread rather than cheap jump scares.A very good movie with excellent acting and casting. Sennia Nanua, who plays Melanie also did a phenomenal job, Gemma Arterton was solid as the protective and caring teacher Helen Justineau. Glenn Close was also good as the Doctor prepared to do almost anything to find a cure for the disease.The whole cast did a very good job and the music complimented rather than overpowered the movie.Worth seeing and I have watched it more than once."
" A great new, better zombie flick
",2018-06-20 00:00:00,9,"I really liked this new take on the genre. Very real, very character driven. The acting is great. The story has heart. The ending is not in any way predictable, which itself is unusual. Well worth your time."
" Why not remake this, Hollywood?
",2018-06-16 00:00:00,4,"Take John Wyndham's 'The Day of the Triffids' and 'The Midwich Cuckoos' and cross it with George A. Romero's 'Day of the Dead' and you end up with 'The Girl with All the Gifts'. Sounds fun right??? However this film takes itself way to seriously, to take any levity from people turning into mushrooms or tribes of feral, grunting 'Beyond the Thunderdome' 10 y'o's... running a mock in central London. The cinematography is flat, cheep and uninteresting, the music annoying and Paddy Considine is (as always) underused.With a better Director and Writer you could take M R Carey's Novel and turn it into something really interesting, fun and poignant. Sadly this falls way short."
" Original but not good
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,5,"Well, I'm a fan of the zombie genre and I found the premise of this film very original, it really got me hooked at the beginning, but the plot just kept getting weaker and weaker as the end being the worst part of the movie, and what killed it completely in my opinion. The rest was OK for me with a nice haunting soundtrack."
" Not that special
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,4,"So many reviews emphasizes the originality of this movie, and having read the book (which is quite original), I was disappointed and disagree. It's not a bad move, but it's not original. In fact I had trouble finding scenes that I had not seen variations of in other movies. Which is a shame, considering the originality of the book upon which the movie is based."
" wow... the british make the best Zombie/appocalyptic films/series
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,9,"A truly amazing performance given by everyone in this movie,
Moving background music that seems to fit perfectly, 
A new and interesting take on the Zombie apocalypse genre. 
Based on the book of the same title by M. R. Carey.My only nit pick is the moldy zombies (hungrys) costume/ make up was not Spectacular but they still did an amazing job considering it is not CGI and there would have been sooo many actors/actresses who would have to have the intense bubbly makeup put on. i imagine this would have taken quite some time.  However the outstanding performances and general feel given from the movie far out weighs the negatives. I highly recommend watching this film.I am not sure if the reference to Ancient Greek Myths is used in the book but it is brilliantly used in the movie.This one goes in my personal 'best movies of all time' list."
" ""And if you try - well, you'd just better not!!""
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,4,"The above title is just one line from the script of this incredibly dumb and unbelievable hash of a movie.A rating of 6.7 on IMDb implies that a movie might be watchable and that one's enjoyment or otherwise will probably just come down to a matter of personal taste. I had no taste at all for this one. Nothing about it was convincing, plausible, or even very interesting or engaging. The script was woefully bad.It started interestingly enough and was slightly intriguing for about the first 15-20 minutes. But then, oh dear oh dear oh dear!!! Just plain stupid with cliche after cliche. It kind of reminded me of, but wasn't quite as stupid I have to say, as that crap from South Africa a couple of years ago ""Chappie"" which I also panned here because it was even worse than this similar pile.I disliked just about everything about ""The Girl Who Had All The Gifts"". And, by the way, who exactly was that girl who had all the gifts. It can't have been Melanie who was a hungry and who had just appalling table manners. She didn't display any particular gifts, apart from an ability to catch pigeons and cats for a light snack and to communicate with other hungry style youngsters with growls and snorts. And that ending with the young hungries taking school lessons from Miss Justineau while she was safely cocooned in a mobile laboratory. I had to laugh out loud at that point. It was the perfect ending to an utterly forgettable movie. God, how I wish I hadn't wasted 110 minutes and 70 baht on this pile of merde. Don't waste ytour time and money"
" Up there with 28 Days Later
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,9,"I loved this movie. Sort of had an underlying theme like a (good) M. Night Shamylan movie. I wasn't expecting the end and it wasn't until after the movie was over that I found out it was a book... I always like reading the book first.Anyways, the end is not bad. It is the best part of the movie! At face value it can seem sad or upsetting but it is actually quite creative."
" The Girl With All The Gifts is a prime example why British zombie films are the best.
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,7,"When you compare something like 28 Days Later to World War Z, the former is head and shoulders above the latter. There is something about the backdrop of England (maybe because I live there) and a smaller budget that makes these films much more terrifying. In this iteration, a mutated fungal disease has turned the human race into flesh-eating...wait for it...""hungries"". Some children are immune to it and are able to interact with the environment whilst still having the infection. So essentially half ""hungry"" and half human. Can they be trusted? That is the question. I really liked the atmosphere to this film, the aesthetic appeal felt like the video game The Last of Us. The production design of post-apocalyptic England looked great, the surge of environmental succession in urban settlements felt fitting. The makeup for the ""hungries"" was realistic...in a horrific kind of way. The cast was excellent, Gemma Arterton, Paddy Considine and Glenn Close were all dependable and brought much needed humanisation to the story. Newcomer Sennia Nanua was able to hold her own against these experienced actors, I thought she performed well. The story in itself is basically survival. Both for the human race and Melanie's (Nanua's character) own future, so there is an internal conflict. Unfortunately, that conflict isn't well presented and I'm sure everyone who has seen it knows that the ending was...an interesting choice to say the least. I won't ruin it but a decision is made out of nowhere, it felt rather out of place. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it. The script is concise, perhaps too concise to the point where our characters are considered monotonous. This is definitely more of a visual story, and the eerie musical score helps elevate the creep factor substantially. I found it to be hypnotic. This is a good little zombie flick that has excellent technical aspects, although the execution of the ending is questionable."
" If George Romero Had $5...
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,6,"If the late George A. Romero had $5 for every zombie movie made since his ""Night of the Living Dead"" film (1968), he'd have died a multi-billionaire and his family wouldn't have to work a day in their lives. Romero is the father of the modern zombie film. As of 3/2/18, there are 157 user reviews. I'm sure one can go elsewhere on the site to learn the movie's plot. The film is a very good variation on the zombie film genre. ""The Girl With All the Gifts"", as many reviewers point out, starts slow and confusing. Then the zombies arrive and the action begins. Sit through the approximately first Â½ hour of the film. You'll be rewarded."
" An enigmatic, interesting and unique take on a tried and tested genre; distinct and delightful.
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,7,"The first twenty minutes of 'The Girl With All The Gifts (2016)' are absolutely phenomenal, enigmatically introducing an interestingly unique concept without any on-the-nose exposition and managing to maintain the perfect mix of mystery and information so the audience isn't confused. Where it unfortunately lulls a little is in the second act, when the world opens up and the plot becomes slightly more generic. Before long, though, the amazingly written characters shine through and the feature picks up the pace again, leading to an emotionally investing and conceptually engaging final third that introduces some difficult questions and finishes off the character arcs in satisfying ways. Distinct and delightful. 7/10"
" Interesting premise, that gets infected with the zombie movie dumbness disease.
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,5,"First half of the movie is an effective setup for an interesting look at a zombie apocalypse.
But sadly the writing quickly descends into stereotypical dumb horror movie tropes.
Then it turns into an episode of the ""The Tribe"". I never knew it was possible for an actor to ""grunt"" unconvincingly, but that is on display here. A lot.
Some great people in the cast (Close, Arterton and the mighty Considine) but sadly let down by a bad script.
The last scene made me laugh out loud it was so cheesy."
" Hugely disappointing
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,2,"'The Girl with All the Gifts' starts out wonderfully and seems to have a lot of promise, but sadly takes a very sudden dive off a very tall cliff. The main character, young Melanie, is easy to sympathise with, although the young actress that plays her is clearly inexperienced and doesn't deliver the most convincing performance. In fact, all of the performances of the main cast are rather mediocre and don't stand out as being particularly strong. Helen (Gemma Arterton) is a strange character whose motivations are unclear and obsession with Melanie can easily be construed as being inappropriate in nature. But perhaps this issue was more related to Arterton's poor performance than the character itself. The intrigue is built from the beginning and leaves you wondering what's happening and why. It's very clear it's set in a futuristic post-apocalyptic world but the rest remains a mystery. Unfortunately, the mystery is quickly revealed - the world has been overtaken by flesh-eating humans called 'hungries'. Essentially, this reveal derailed from any appeal of the show and left me completely underwhelmed. In other words, 'The Girl with All the Gifts' is just another zombie movie. This fact explains why I watched it based on the fact it was listed under the horror section on Netflix, although I wouldn't characterise this as being a horror in the traditional sense. There's minimal gore and zero tension or fear. Despite the hungries being depicted in a slightly different way to traditional zombies (they're much faster and agile for starters), the fact remains that this is very much a zombie movie. The second I found this out I wanted to switch off due to my dislike for zombie movies, but I decided to commit and see it through to the end. The plot is boring, uneventful and lacking in any real substance. The action is sparse and boring and it's impossible to form attachments to any of the characters. The decisions made by Melanie are often stupid (I suppose we can forgive her for that since she's a child) and the ending was unsatisfying. I have no idea how a movie as poor as this has managed to get a 6 star rating. In terms of movies in the same genre, it's extremely poor and lacking in every area. Don't waste your time with this movie and if you're looking for a decent zombie movie you'd have better luck with movies such as Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead, Quarantine, I Am Legend, 28 Days Later or Dawn of the Dead."
" Terrible on every way
",2018-02-15 00:00:00,1,"I cannot help to think that anyone that has rated this 6 or above is a payed review or watched a different movie ... the entire plot is mediocre at best, dull, long, boring, accompanied by utter poor acting, honestly speaking 6.7/10 is an insult, the first 30 min are watchable ... but it takes a HUGE dive afterwards."
" Colm McCarthy breathes new life into the lumbering zombie genre.
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Other than Train to Busan and the early season of The Walking Dead, I'm not a fan of the mindless monsters. However, with stellar casting, detail-oriented world building, and grounded, believable characters, The Girl with All the Gifts breathes new life into the ""undead.""McCarthy's Girl with All the Gifts is more than a coming to age story about responsibility and adulthood. It portrays the dangers of conformity. The authority figures are scientists, teachers, and officers. They are forcing the children to learn what they teach. They are discovering a cure so that mankind can remain as is. And the movie begs us to answer the question, what does it mean to be human? To read my full review, go to alexcgates.com"
" Read the book first, still loved the movie.
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,8,"So I read the book a couple of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. A unique take on a zombie story--the sentient zombie. I don't remember the book in detail, so when I saw this movie yesterday, it felt pretty fresh. Therefore, I won't compare the two. The movie is well produced and does the story and themes justice. Top-notch acting. The little-girl protagonist (and actress) is totally great. A story about what life and free will truly mean. A hundred percent engrossing from the opening credits (amazing theme music by the way) even if you know where it's going. Also, Glenn Close--where the hell has she been?--is wondrous. She was a lovely surprise in the casting. Overall, a very entertaining movie and a wonderful addition to the zombie genre."
" A Fun Zombie Twister
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,6,"I gave this film a decent rating simply for the unique twist in plot and amazing acting. I am not a horror film lover, in fact I usually avoid them. But I respect Glen Close as an actress and it sounded a little different from the usual zombie humdrum. The story line is interesting, the actors are great, the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, it is intellectually stimulating, and the ending isn't too bad. There is humanity here, something hard to find in horror flicks, so I respect the film. Given all the positives I must say it IS a zombie horror flick so expect all the icky gore that comes with horror."
" Interesting take on zombies but unrealistic
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,4,"When I think of zombie movies I cannot think of 1 title that did well. This movie provided an interesting take on zombies and outbreaks but it was VERY unrealistic. For example, how does fungus spread quicker through a bite from a zombie (or Hungry, as they're called in this film) compared to breathing in actual fungal spores? If an infection is fungal than it would inherently be airborne, especially with Hungries having the infection OUTSIDE of their body as well. 
The movie didn't address: why the kids were being kept, where the infection originated from, time period, if the rest of the world was like this, and why didn't they try to get a vaccine out of someone already infected? History has shown that for the most serious things that a vaccine was derived from someone infected or previously infected."
" The Book Was Better, lols.
",2017-12-22 00:00:00,5,"I watched this with my husband (who had not read the book). He found the ending confusing, so I went on a very smug 'the ending was better explained in the book' spiel. Yes, I'm one of *those* sorts of people.But it was! The movie lost something in the translation. Melanie's motivation in setting the massive fungal tower on fire was not entirely clear.In the book, Caldwell does not discover a vaccine. However, she does discover that there is no cure for the fungus; Melanie and her ilk (the second generation) simply have a less progressive infestation of the fungus in their brains. So Melanie sets the fungal tree alight, releasing the fungal spores. It is partly an apocalyptic event but also an act of mercy, wiping out humanity (bar Miss Justineau) in order to start again with the second generation.There were plenty of things about this movie that aggravated me but I really can't put my finger on them. However it was, by and large, a faithful adaptation. The performances were also very good. The little girl who played Melanie did an amazing job.Regardless, I still think you'd get more out of the book. Read the book. :)"
" oh no not ANOTHER zombie movie(Or is this predictive programming?)
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,1,"Truth be told this was a random pick at a DVD rental shop
need one more to get 5 for thousand yen ( University E.S.L teacher in japan here) I liked the music in the early scenes...alas I soon cringed when I realized it was another bloody zombie movie
What an insult to our intelligence .
-or is this predictive programming?
over 50 of these freak shows in the last decade.....seems to me that slowly but surely the are becoming more believable,more scientific and less horror movie like

how easy would it be to infect them...."
" Hungries
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,7,"Before The Waking Dead came along, people thought the zombie subgenre was dead in the water. The zombie films for the most part just weren't able to capture the right tone and essence. So even though there's been a million of them and most of them are much of the same thing, I always appreciate the ones that bring something new and fresh to the genre. The Girl With All the Gifts does just that.The British post-apocalyptic film takes place after most of the world has been decimated to due to an unknown fungal disease, with only a few military bases left. The twist here is that on this military base is a group of second generation children who are infected with the disease but are under control of their senses for the most part. That is, when they aren't smelling human flesh.After several life threatening sequences, a few soldiers, a teacher, and one of those second generation children (named Melanie) embark on a trek to get to the next safe zone, with their base being overrun by zombies (or hungries as they call them). Melanie, a seemingly more intelligent and aware child, forms a special bond with the teacher, named Helen Justineau and played by Gemma Arterton. This is the one human connection that I think is worth caring about. Since you don't get much backstory on the soldiers, including one played well by Paddy Considine, you are almost forced into caring for the two. And that's the one thing I was constantly hoping we would get more of, character depth and backstory. It just becomes difficult to figure out who you're going to root for when you don't have much in way of their backstory to think about.With that said, I appreciated that this film involved a different approach to the zombie genre. Yes, there is the subplot involving someone looking for a cure (which is always something that comes up) but the more calculated approach to the pacing, and reserved display of gore, The Girl With All the Gifts feels like a fresh entry into the genre. Heck, have we ever had our lead character be an second generation infected child? Just by those standards this was something original.7.1/10"
" A truly outstanding effort. One of the best in the genre, for quite some time
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,9,"If you like an intelligent, well thought out zombie film, this one is for you. I was quite surprised at how well this film was put together. An outstanding film, considering it's relative modest budget, and some convincing performances, well assured direction, and great production values. The credit goes to screenwriter Mike Carey, who has adapted his novel of the same name with abundant craft and attention to his story's every detail. The film is, essentially, about a zombie apocalypse, and at this point, some of you will have raised your guard. Yes, it's another zombie movie, in which characters try to survive in an urban landscape that has become a nightmarish place, where hordes of the shambling undeadâ€”in this case, people infected with a brain fungus â€”are around every corner.Ignore that. Carey certainly does in the opening act of the film, which, in retrospect, serves as something of a self-contained distraction from the plot line at which the story finally arrives.One should also ignore those preconceptions because this isn't some run-of-the-mill zombie movie. It's one that possesses clearly defined characters, cares about the ideas they both state and represent, and has a few vital things to sayâ€”about human nature and, in a way that doesn't become clear until the climax, about the very notion of what a story about zombies means.The opening section begins with Melanie (newcomer Sennia Nanua, who plays a difficult, ambiguous role with wisdom and maturity), a girl who is locked in a cell. In the morning, two soldiers enter through the metal door to her room, with their assault rifles aimed at her. They strap her into a wheelchair and roll her down a long hall with similar doors leading to other cells. She is accompanied by other kids in the same state of restraint. They're brought to a room, where painted boxes and numbers on the floor line up with their cell assignments. Their teacher is Helen Justineau (a compassionate but tough Gemma Arterton), whose genuine concern for these kidsâ€”and especially for Melanieâ€”is an anomaly in this place.The remainder of the central cast of characters is made up of Dr. Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close), the lead scientist at the facility, and Sgt. Eddie Parks (Paddy Considine), the head of military personnel on site. Each of the three charactersâ€”the teacher, the scientist, and the soldierâ€”has a specific role to play in Melanie's life. Justineau indulges the girl's desire to hear stories, with the tale of Pandora and that mystical box being of particular interest to Melanie. Caldwell offers her logic puzzles to solve, and Melanie finds a unique solution to the riddle of the cat that may be alive or dead inside a box. Parks has seen what kids like Melanie are capable of doing, and while he keeps his distance with stoic professionalism, the girl is kind to the soldiers at the facilityâ€”even when they have their rifles aimed at her head.Melanie, as should be obvious by now, is special, although not necessarily unique among her peers. To say more in terms of specifics about the character would be unfair, but suffice it to say, she and the trio of diversely-minded caretakers soon find themselves out in the wider world, after a devastating assault on the compound (Director Colm McCarthy follows Melanie through the ensuing carnage in a sequence that is impressively staged and serves as a way to see what the girl is truly capable of doingâ€”whether she likes it or not).They make their way to a ravaged, now nearly forest-like, and, obviously, zombie-infested London (after a stop in a forestâ€”another solid action sequence, punctuated by Parks showing what he's willing to doâ€”that whittles down the number of ancillary characters accompanying the party). The goal is find sanctuary in another facility, which may or may not be safe.McCarthy's screenplay is treading familiar terrain, especially as the party makes its way through the city, yet it has a distinct focus on these characters that is both simple and revealing. In the world beyond the facility, the roles essentially remain the same, although now there is a final goal for each of the three caretakers. Justineau wants Melanie to be free. Caldwell wants her for science. Parks believes it is best to kill her. In a way, the conflict is not between these ideas of what to do with the girl. It's in the fact that none of them takes into account what Melanie actually wants for herself.Consadine, Close, Nadua, Arterton, and Akinade are all superb in their performances, and the acting is a lot of what makes this film shine. But, along with that comes good writing, excellent direction, and the kind of production you often do not see in films of this type."
" Book lacked style, movie lacks content
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,5,"I read the book before watching the film. Book had quality characters and a story that, for the most part, made sense if you accepted the premises. On the other hand I thought the book was poorly written. In other words the book was good content in somewhat bad package. I'd rate the book 7/10.Unfortunately the movie ruins lot of what was good in the book (surprising because they're written by the same person): characters are stripped of their personalities and thus lose their motives; interesting group dynamics from the book are replaced by seemingly random decisions; many major plot elements stop making sense with some crucial stuff removed from the story. The end result is completely different and worse story with lots of shared elements.It would be unfair to say it's really bad movie but it isn't good either. Acting is fine for the most part and the film looks great considering the budget. It's just that more faithful interpretation of the book could have been so much better. 5/10 is my verdict."
" There's still life in the zombie genre
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,8,"The world has been decimated by a fungal infection that turns people into mindless, flesh eating zombies. A group of children are being studied in an army facility because although they are infected, they are not mindless and can control their desire to eat flesh. The base is overrun and one of the children (Sennia Nanua), her teacher (Gemma Arterton), a doctor (Glenn Close) and an army sergeant (Paddy Considine) escape with their lives. They navigate through the zombie infested ruins of London in an attempt to reach another safe facility. If you've played ""The Last of Us"", a lot of this film will seem familiar ... from it's fungus infected zombies to the ruined, vegetation laden city setting to the plot involving a child who may hold the key to the future. But this is decidedly it's own story. One of the strongest points of that game was the character dynamics, and that's true here too, but they are quite different. Questions of what counts as human are raised and when it's okay to use something for your own gain. Another sign that maybe there are fresh ideas left in the overly represented zombie genre."
" Boring with a ridiculous story
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,2,"I kept hoping this movie would get better. Even with just 15 minutes to go, I somehow had hopes it would pull a rabbit out of a hat and something exciting or unexpected would happen.Instead, it ended as it started: boring, dull, stupid.The first 10 minutes are interesting as you're wondering what's going on with the kids. Once you find out, it's blah meh boring.The movie tries to bring some kind of ""interesting"" take on the zombie genre by introducing kids who are half zombie, half human and who somehow may hold ""the cure"". It does so by having pathetic, whining, irrational female scientists take a liking to the kids and protecting them from the evil, bad, mean male soldiers (gee, see any laughable parallels with political correctness there?). Every time one of these women said or did something, I wanted the soldiers to slap or shoot them. It was clear they would let the soldiers die to save their precious little zombie runts. Oh, the soldiers were total idiots too. Drive around, make noise, have no plan, just do dumb stuff... The ending was a total joke too. Everyone's turned into a zombie except that one female doctor, who feeds her I'm-too-old-to-be-a-mommy vacuum by ""educating"" the little zombie runts.Do not waste your time."
" A different type of zombie film that still lacks bite
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,5,"Just when you think the zombie film has exhausted itself from all possible incarnations and wild ideas, along comes a film like The Girl with All the Gifts.Based on Mike Carey's best-selling book of the same name, Gift's really is a zombie film with a difference as we're introduced to Sennia Nanua's Melanie, a young girl in a mysterious facility, strapped daily to her wheelchair and delivered to a classroom full of other similar students.As directed by usual TV director Colm McCarthy, we're not initially sure of exactly what is happening or why people are acting as they are but quickly we become aware that these seemingly innocent children harbor a far deeper and dangerous inward inclination that turns them into flesh hungry zombie like attackers at the slightest smell of bare flesh, human touch or sight of human blood.It's an exciting and unnerving start to proceedings that is only heightened by an impressive sequence in which a ruthless swarm of blood-thirsty zombies overrun the secure facility where Melanie is kept, but from the films initially gripping start, McCarthy's film starts to quickly taper away into a rather pedestrian and uninteresting experience.You get a sense that Gifts was unable to do the most with a budget that was probably stretched to maximum and the scope of the film suffers because of this as the stories group led by Paddy Considine's soldier Eddie Parks, Gemma Arterton's caring teacher Helen Justineau, Glenn Close's determined scientist Caroline Caldwell and Nanua's feisty and smart beyond her years Melanie bunker down in an abandoned hospital in London while trying to figure out a way to get to safety.The actors all do try their hardest, Considine is on song as you would expect while newcomer Nanua has some brilliant moments as young Melanie, while the films score by Cristobal Tapia de Veer is moody and atmospheric but the dwindling tension and interest levels of the film that's hampered by Glenn Close's over the top turn as Dr. Caldwell all combine to an end product that at times works to a high level but often finds itself no better than many of its other so-so zombie compatriots.Final Say â€“ Brutal and unrelenting in its depiction of a zombie infested England and featuring a noteworthy turn by the young Nanua, The Girl with All the Gifts starts with a bang but ends with a whimper and while this is a zombie film with a different touch, it's not enough to make McCarthy's film anything more than a watchable diversion.2 Â½ tubes of gel out of 5"
" This Zombie Movie Has BRAAAAIIINNNNSSS
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,8,"If this was a wide release in America, it would've been a worthy hit. Imagine Hunger Games, only much more honest in its realitiesÂ…& with zombies. It's a dystopian sci-fi horror film with some great ideas about the right to live & the innateness of good vs. evil. The lead character is wonderful, & McCarthy lets us meet her without holding our hands; curiosity & intrigue lead us into her world. And there's one scene in a courtyard that is one of the best, most well-scaled / paced / staged zombie scenes ever."
" Film adaptation of book is too abridged and should have been a mini-series
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,6,"I quite liked the young adult novel by M.R. Carey this film is based upon, but I found myself sorely disappointed by the film version. The story is an interesting one. In a future where a world has been overrun by zombies, here called ""hungries,"" scientists on a military base are studying a group of intelligent child zombies as a potential source for a cure to the zombie outbreak. Thing go awry, as with most zombie stories, when the base is breached and a teacher, an intelligent zombie girl, a pair of soldiers, and a scientist are forced to flee their sanctuary on a road trip to London, which they hope is still surviving and can provide safe haven. This film adaptation has a strong cast, a script written by the original author, and solid production values. However, I was struck that although the film was faithful to the source material, it was so abridged that it lacked any depth. There was so much story to cover that the filmmakers had to race to get to it all, which in the end rendered the story a fairly straightforward action/adventure tale and left out major elements of the book. Now don't get me wrong. I can care less if a film adaptation is loyal to it's source material as long as it was done well. John Ford's adaptation of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a masterpiece, even though it completely leaves out the last third of the book. Then you have the opposite with someone like Erich Von Stroheim who in 1924 filmed almost every paragraph of the novel McTeague in a wildly long 8-hour film adaptation. ""The Girl with All the Gifts"" isn't a bad film, but it really should have been an 8-part mini- series to tell the story it wanted to tell. SPOILER ALERT! I was also surprised at the change to the book's ending. The film's ending allowed the teacher to remain human and to continue teaching a group of zombie children versus the book's ending where she is turned into a zombie who would continue to teach the zombie children. The movie ending has hope for humanity, whereas the book's ending has humanity ending and being replaced by an inevitable heir, which was the logical ending and the next step for this new world, even if it was a sad ending. Overall, this was a very good book, but only a mildly diverting film."
" Film adaptation lacks teeth
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,5,"This pseudo-zombie story has a lot going for it - namely Glenn Close - but it is ultimately let down by some sloppy writing and characters who continually make the most idiotic decisions in order to engineer some suspense. It's an age old problem with horror films, where people say and do inexplicable things for the horror to actually happen, and 'The Girl With All the Gifts' fails to buck the trend.With echoes of '28 Days Later...' and 'Children of Men', the film gets off to a good start by establishing a strange dystopian future where children are imprisoned for mysterious reasons by the army so scientists can use them for seemingly 'nefarious' purposes. Director Colm McCarthy brings a certain atmospheric style to the visuals and modulates the somber tone of the piece rather well, underscored by the hauntingly offbeat music score, but his staging of the zombie attack sequences do not deliver on the requisite intensity one would expect and demand from the genre. In fact, some of the sequences and zombie (over)acting comes off as pretty laughable. Even if McCarthy did manage to get the 'scary bits' right, he simply cannot transcend the contrived and derivative material he is working from.Mike Carey adapts his own novel for the screen and seems to have excised a lot of the context and detail from his story in order to meet the strict runtime rule of 120 minutes or less, truncating his narrative and sacrificing character development in the process. The core group of characters fighting their way across this post- apocalyptic landscape never truly connect in an emotionally palpable way and therefore we don't fully invest or buy into their respective relationships, especially the supposed bond between Gemma Arterton's teacher and Sennia Nanua's 'infected' pupil, which is never developed beyond a few brief scenes at the start. And that's a major problem considering 'The Girl With All the Gifts' is trying to be a character-driven horror thriller. It gives a good cast very little to play with beyond some perfunctory conflicts and emotional beats. However, there are two standouts. The first is newcomer Nanua as the titular character who manages to find both the human pathos and animalistic hunger in a rather complicated role for her age, while the aforementioned Glenn Close simply steals every scene she is in and is a joy to watch as she fires on all cylinders like the acting freight train she is.On a technical level, plenty here works, it's just that the screenplay doesn't do justice to the level of the craft working in service of it. By the end, you don't really care if the human race survives because the ambassadors we are following are so colossally stupid in their decision-making that you feel okay with natural selection taking its course and putting us out of our collective misery."
" A literate and persuasive moral fable presented as a science fiction/zombie story (spoilers in last paragraph)
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,9,"Once again, I prefer optimistic stories about the future that are thoughtful about where the technology-evolutionary-human interface is going. At its most superficial, The Girl with all the Gifts is yet another post-apocalyptic zombie horror story. However, though it's hardly realistic at face value (it's hard to know what biological process could alter human behaviour so quickly), it does have a lot to say, and tells its story exceptionally effectively. At its most positive, the film speculates about how humans might coevolve with a fungal pathogen spreading as a plague. That part, sadly, is not unrealistic at all. Our species is falling behind on developing preventative and ameliorative treatments for infectious diseases, so it's not at all hard to imagine a future in which an infectious illness rages out of control. A theme of recent (deeply pessimistic) science fiction is that humanity always loses, and you get that in spades in this film. Despite its overriding dark themes, the film was, in balance, exceptionally well-acted and executed, there was no effort required to suspend disbelief, and some deep moral questions were explored in an original and surprising way. The appeal to the intelligent viewer was also refreshing, with references to Schrodinger's Cat, to literature, and to science as it's truly practiced. If there is a better ""zombie movie"" out there, I haven't seen it. SPOILERS FROM HERE: The film wraps up on a curiously optimistic but conflicted note, in which a cluster of partially resistant infected human children exhibit the ability to accommodate the disease, to learn, and to develop a culture. To be blunt, I was not persuaded by the film's conclusion, though the moral lesson --- that killing the film's protagonist was necessary for humanity to triumph, struck me as morally valid. The implication is that all of humanity must therefore very likely succumb to the disease. The happy note at the end did not convince me that the resistant, but still ""hungry,"" children were on the way to a better future. Rather, humanity simply lost the battle, but lost because saving a life that was of value was a sound moral choice. The film is literary science fiction versus hard science fiction, meaning that some obvious scientific questions were not thought out, even in a cursory manner (e.g., what kind of ecosystem, if any, would permit a modified zombie culture to survive, let alone thrive?). At that level, the film was no longer informative, though, in fairness, it was not trying to be."
" Despite some flaws, this is probably the best of its kind since 28 Days Later
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,7,"In a dystopian future in London which is in the middle of an outbreak which has caused several people to become flesh-eating hungries, a small team of personnel have quarantined a bunch of special children for the purposes of research - it seems that these children have the flesh-eating desire, but still have fully functioning minds. Dr Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close) believes that she is on the brink of finding a cure when their base is breached and her team are forced to evacuate. The team find themselves in a remote area with limited provisions, radio contact and with hungry flesh-eaters in close proximity. Their only hope of survival seemingly lies with Melanie (Sennia Nanua) a test subject who can move freely within the flesh-eaters.Zombie type films come in all shapes and forms and inevitably can prove to be very hit-and-miss. There are some that are fast-paced in terms of action and spectacle, but lacking in originality or a halfway decent story (such as Pandemic for example) and then there are others that go too far in the other direction by being dull and rather cumbersome (such as Maggie for example). Therefore it is refreshing that every now and again a zombie type film such as Girl With All The Gifts comes along which manages to be both fast-paced and at times quite thought-provoking...Not much is explained in the early stages, but the intriguing set-up means that it doesn't matter so much at first and it does become an easy film to become engaged in. As time rolls on we start to get an idea of who these kids are and how they have become who they are and the truth turns out to be more disturbing than most people would have initially assumed...Where the film really kicks up a gear is when the team become isolated and it very much becomes a 'Walking Dead' type of affair whereby our team must try to outsmart the flesh-eaters in order to survive. Some aspects of this are quite creative (such as finding animal-fodder to distract the flesh-eaters). Although its quite imaginative it's also quite contrived - in the middle of a flesh-eating apocalypse we have a dog that can be found pretty much straight away and that has somehow managed to survive the apocalypse. The other method of avoiding the flesh-eaters by simply walking past them all quietly also seemed rather lazy, but I have to be honest that in the actual 'moment' it was quite tense to watch these scenes unfold. Despite some of my objections above, the film does at least have some originality and the explanation given for the epidemic occurring does at least show that some thought has been put into the concept. The film also moves well and director and screenwriter both work well together in keeping the film exciting whilst also providing the exposition necessary to explain away the story - a good example of this comes when Doctor Caldwell and Melanie are talking in the hospital and the film cuts backwards and forwards to them and Justineau which all proves to be a good use of screen time in my opinion.The Girl with all the gifts is a mash-up between 28 Days Later, The Walking Dead with just a splash of Children Of Men about it and if those things are your cup of tea then I'm almost certain that you'll like this film."
" Wow, what a pleasant surprise
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,8,"I'm really baffled by the relatively low rating of this movie. I guess most people prefer mindless slasher movies these days. This movie was arguably one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. Very smartly written and the acting performances were on point. There's really not much I could possibly critique about it.What I really liked was the fact that this movie had a lot of character development. That's the ultimate mark of good storytelling. So I really enjoyed that aspect.The end was so cathartic and ironic at the same time. Whoever wrote the script had a great sense of peripety. I can't say enough good things about the movie. It's very nuanced and intellectual without shying away from the more emotional aspects that were explored by means of philosophical inquiry. I mean, the protagonist had a knack for asking the right questions. That became apparent right from the get-go."
" World War Z meets Lord of the Flies
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,7,"I like the zombie genre & generally enjoyed this film. Surprisingly it has a new take on the zombie story and is set in the UK, which has been largely overrun by the zombie infection. The film for the first half I give 8/10 but the last half 6/10 so i have scored it 7/10 overall.Pregnant mothers infected with the fungus/virus, in turn infect their embryo unborn babies, who eat their way out of their mothers body. These children are still human albeit with a zombie eating reflex (if they smell human food) our clever humans rub a masking gel on themselves to avoid exciting the kids. Scientist Glenn Close is trying to use these children to study the infection and extract a antidote using their brains. So the children have to be killed in the interest of research. The main child, Melanie, who plays the part extremely well, is very likable and very intelligent so Atherton (as the children's teacher) becomes very attached to her and tries to protect her from dissection.It all takes place in some sort of airfield/army camp where surrounded by zombies - that only has a barbed wire type perimeter fence This is one of the many 'plot' (or fence) holes. TOP TIP: In the event of zombie apocalypse don't hole up behind barbed wire/mesh fences. Find somewhere with good old fashioned fortifications and big walls e.g. castles/victorian forts - which are abundant in the UK. Predictably the zombies break the fence and overrun the base. Atherton, Close and some soldiers are able to escape in a truck with Melanie. Another plot hole, instead of stopping somewhere in the open, by a river to get water, they stop in a wood to get water from a river, i.e. so random zombies can run out of nowhere to begin killing off soldiers. For some strange reason they decide they have to go through zombie infested London to get to another camp. Melanie proves useful in helping destract the many zombies, she is invisible to them being infected herself. They find an abandoned mobile labaroatory and hole up their. Close has noted the zombies are acting as fertiliser for the fungus to start growing big trees which in turn are producing seed pods. If these open, by heat or water, then the fungus will become airbourne and humanity will be destroyed. Another plot hole, they send out one soldier, alone, to forage and find food in zombie infested London. The scriptwriter wants to kill off another soldier by is too lazy or unimaginative, to think up a plausible way. Melanie discovers a little tribe of infected children like herself, who smell the poor lone soldier. Predictably trap him, kill and eat him. Melanie protects the others from the little zombie kid tribe. Close wants to urgently dissect Melanie to produce a cure, but Melanie, who is becoming more self aware, defends herself and Close is toast. Melanie has changed from wanting to be back to normal human to basically protecting her new 'species' so she sets fire to the fungal tree to release the spores and kill off mankind. Bizarrely she leaves atherton in the laboratory (hermetically sealed) and the film ends with her (atherton) conducting classes via intercom to all the little lord of the flies tribe and other children seated outsideAll in all it's OK film, the first half I really enjoyed but it rather flopped at the end. 7/10"
" As a warning...
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,8,"...this one is unlikely to appeal to those looking for your classic Romero zombie movies, nor is it likely to appeal to those looking for a classic drama. Hard to describe...but well made and very watchable combination of a story driven zombie movie.Good first:A zombie-ish flick from the point of view of one of the infected. Well thought out and well acted. Very good scripting. Decent cinematography. An original take on the Zombie genre.Without spoilers its a bit tough to define, but rest assured there are some interesting turns in this one and an engaging plot. Well acted from both the experienced cast and the relative newcomers. Not so good:The pacing could have been better. Drags a bit here and there...not horrible, just could have been better.Overall, good way to spend a couple hours on a rainy afternoon."
" finally a different zombie approach
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,7,"as I wrote in the summary, finally a different zombie approach. the ""science"" of this zombie apocalypse is somewhat similar to ""The Last of Us"" game, but it goes further, to the ""second stage"" as they call it in the movie. A fungus causing people turn to zombies (""hungries"" is what they call them here"") but at some point infants(as explained in the movie) adopt to it creating some kind of symbiosis. With all that said, the plot doesn't simply take you from point A to B. It differs as the characters find themselves in different positions. They change and evolve. And the actors playing the roles do that change justice. Even young Sennia Nanua is able to show the drama of her character. Just as well as Paddy Considine or Gemma Arterton, with Glenn Close not even needing the mention. Time spent watching that is not a time wasted."
" One of the most original zombie flicks in years
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,7,"The Girl With All The Gifts takes place in a near future in which society has succumbed to a fungal disease and tells the story of Melanie - a young girl who is being studied in a secure base camp in England.The first act is fantastic. The introduction to this world and the characters is done subtly, allowing the audience to try and understand the circumstances and how everything works instead of being told everything in an opening exposition dump that insults the audiences' intelligence. This creates a greater sense of involvement from the audience and gets the viewer invested in the story within the first few minutes. By choosing to show the film through Melanie's perspective, the film gains a sense of originality and freshness.Where the film falters slightly is during the second act as a series of events occur that lead the protagonists onto a journey through a barren London (allowing for an almost distracting amount of product placement), which is seen far too often in movies of this genre, and loses some of the mystery and originality that made the standout first act so great. Also the ending would have been much more powerful had it left out the final scene and left a fraction of ambiguity. Luckily though the film always entertains, mainly due to our protagonist who is different from anything that we have seen before, excellently played by newcomer Sennia Nanua. The rest of the cast are great too, especially Paddy Considine in a more serious leading role that shows off his talents as an actor. Mike Carey's script, which is adapted from his own source novel, is intelligent and boasts many moral dilemmas that really make the audience think, increasing their investment in the story, and staying with them long after viewing. Another thing that increases audience engagement, hooking the viewer within mere seconds, is the incredible soundtrack by Cristobal Tapia de Veer; subtle yet eerie, haunting and mysterious, off kilter but brimming with hope.The Girl With All The Gifts is one of the most original zombie flicks out there. Interesting social commentary and great performances elevate this above most in its genre, but unfortunately the second act is far less interesting than the first and some pacing issues let the film down. Still, this is one thought-provoking and entertaining journey that is highly recommended. 7/10"
" Decent Zombie Movie
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,6,"Should horror movies get their own rating scales? Anyway, ""The Girl with All the Gifts"" may not be great, but its good enough to hold your interest for most of the runtime I thought. It wasn't as entertaining as the recent Korean zombie train movie (Train to Busan), but avoided less clichÃ©s than its Asian brethren. I liked that the storytellers in ""Girl"" developed their own culminations/results of what was happening and posited some ideas of what the plague was and why it might have been happening. Glenn Close (yes that's correct) is onboard in a co-starring role as a doctor/researcher. The cast and direction are pretty good. The only thing I didn't like much was the epilogue scene which I won't spoil completely but state that it seemed fairly far-fetched and absurdly hopeful. Give it 6.5/10 and recommended for zombie fans."
" Better than the average zombie movie
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,7,"The story is interesting. It starts with the premise of zombie children being educated. The goal is to find one candidate who is the most self-controlled, or most rational human-like. This one would be the basis for a vaccine. The quest of the movie is to bring that vaccine to fruition.As in many quest type stories, there can be parts where the plot slows down. And as in zombie movies, that means a lot of killing of zombies and by zombies.I thought I could see how the story was going to end, but I was not even close, so I would chalk that up to a decent plot twist.The acting was good enough not to detract from the story, maybe even excellent in some cases, but given the setting I didn't think any stood out. If any, I think Paddy Considine did well in not turning out to be the clichÃ© s.o.b. sergeant."
" The Girl with all the Gifts Review.
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,8,"The Girl with all the Gifts is an eerie, strange, somewhat under-seen gem from director Colm Mccarthy. The film opens incredibly strong, I went into this film knowing absolutely nothing about it, which is the best way to approach this film. It starts with a British school teacher Helen(Gemma Arterton) who is teaching a classroom full of chained up children in an underground bunker. The audience is given next to no information as to whats happening, which is very effective and makes us sympathetic towards the children's situation. It's made even more effective when children are sent to the base doctor, Dr. Caldwell(Glenn Close) in which they are never seen again.When the film finally reveals it's hand sympathies flip, and it becomes evident as to why the soldiers and medical staff are so afraid of the kids. This goes doubly for the girl with all the gifts Melanie(Sennia Nanua) who displays incredible abilities, along side brutal savagery. During the course of the film she develops a connection to Helen, so when she's next to be experimented on it's up to Helen to save her. As this happens the base becomes compromised and it's down to Helen, Melanie, Dr. Caldwell and Sgt. Parks(Paddy Considine) to navigate through the hostile, dilapidated ruins of Britain to join up with other survivors and try and find a cure to a fungal disease that has ravaged the planet.The first thing I have to mention is the hauntingly creepy, ethereal score by Cristoba Tapia de Veer. It's an uncanny, eerie piece of work that is unnerving and adds extra layers upon the tone and atmosphere of the film. The direction of the film is just as strong, seeing familiar sites being reclaimed by nature is stunning to look at, and reminded me a lot of The Last of Us video game. The only negative aspect to the cinematography was that a-lot of scenes were a bit too washed out with greys and browns, which felt a bit dull during the forest scenes in the film. The film also boasts strong performances across the board, with the standout being Sennia Nanua as the young girl Melanie. She managed to not only hold her own against veteran actors, but delivered a phenomenal performance despite this being her debut feature.My only real complaint I had with the film is one that is inherent in the Zombie/infected genre itself. It treads a-lot of the same ground that these types of films have done before, So at times it feels like you are going over same beats of previous films. What separates this film from the sea of recent infected films is its incredible soundtrack, beautiful floral cinematography, and its focus on its characters rather then action set pieces. The film has no problem taking a few minutes to slow down and explore its characters."
" Interesting Zombie film - takes a slightly different approach
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,6,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I was sure what to expect, was this going to be another shoot all the zombies, and save the world, or was this going to be a zombies take over the world. The first part of the film attempts to build the story line, but the action was slow. I would have liked to know more background rather than repetitive scenes. I won't spoil the ending, but I expected a slightly different result."
" Not bad....for a Zombie film.
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,6,"If like me you're completely bored with Zombie and Super-Hero films....Bravo! Nevertheless, I stumbled across The Girl with All the Gifts thinking it was a supernatural piece as I'd never heard of the film.With a budget of just Â£4m, it's a decent picture. The acting is first rate and the sets are very believable. The Product Placement advertising is a little obvious and the whining music jarred my ear from time to time, but this is still worth watching. Some scenes are refreshingly new and intriguing ...Glenn (Fatal Attraction) Close is in it, so too the rising star Gemma Arterton.My main gripe was the final scene, I simply found it ridi..... well, see for yourself! Not too gory and not over long at 90mins."
" The Last of Us, if it was made into a movie
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the biggest surprises of the year. I encourage anyone to go into this movie knowing nothing about it because that's the best way to experience it. Prior to seeing it, all I knew was that it was a zombie movie and saw a screenshot of a little black girl strapped to a chair with a Hannibal Lecter face mask and I was immediately sold. Avoid seeing any trailers or reading any plot descriptions about it and I guarantee that you will have a great time.I really enjoyed this film. It offers a smarter and more thought-provoking story than most zombie movies. The world-building is really intriguing and well presented, which might have to do with the fact that it's based on a popular sci-fi novel of the same name. At first, I was under the impression that A) it was a single location movie and B) it was an indie- drama but I was so happy to be wrong. The movie did not skimp on the horror or the kinda thrills we would expect from a zombie movie. The high production values were quite a surprise too, as the movie eventually gets to places that are interesting. Hardcore zombie movie fans might lament the lack of invention or creativity in recent zombie movies but they shouldn't be worried here. The Girl with all the Gifts manages to introduce some fresh new takes to the genre that lead to some interesting puzzle-solving scenarios, details I won't reveal so you can have fun experiencing it on your own.As for performances, Gemma Arterton and Glenn Close are the two notable cast members but the biggest surprise here is Sennia Nanua who plays the titular Girl with all the Gifts. Her role is incredibly complex as she has to emote two completely different types of expression from each end of the spectrum at any given point. As such, Sennia gives what is arguably one of the best child performances of the year as she brings to life a character that is so unique and unlike anything I've seen in a zombie movie.I alluded to the movie's similarities to The Last of Us, a popular 2013 zombie horror game made by Naughty Dog, in the review title and it is true. After watching the movie, I want director Colm McCarthy to direct the Last of Us adaptation because he manages to not only capture the exciting zombie horror tension and a look and atmosphere similar to that game, but also masterfully handling the nuance and subtlety of character-building and drama, which is a huge part of that game. I'm excited for what this director does next.Overall, this film was a solid entry in the zombie genre. It ranks up there with the likes of 28 Weeks Later, World War Z and Train to Busan. Not a masterpiece, but a really satisfying and fun one. There's maybe like a 10 min lull towards the end but the first two acts are very good. It's a shame this film kinda flew under the radar because I think it would have played really well on a big theater with a huge crowd. I wanted to tell everyone about the The Girl with all the Gifts after seeing it and I hope you guys will do so too :)"
" Schrodinger's cat is just a meal to a hungry person
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,10,"This is a new take on the zombie apocalypse. The word ""zombie"" is not used as they are not the living dead but infected people who eat meat. They are called ""Hungries."" The infection is spread through fluids. There is a cream to kill the fungus externally and something to mask the smell of humans as it appears Hungries have a great sense of smell.At a rural English army site nicknamed the Bates Motel is housed a second generation of children Hungries in restraints. They are taught in a classroom and look like normal children and nothing like Bub (original Day of the Dead.) Restrained child Melanie (Sennia Nanua) is extremely gifted and clearly not just a mimic. Dr. Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close) wants to cut her up to make a vaccine, while the teacher (Gemma Arterton) objects and intercedes to help her. As things hit the fan, a small group finds itself on the run.Don't hear the word ""symbiosis"" too many times in a zombie film. I enjoyed the fact this film was a change of pace. We have no idea how it will end. The film looks at philosophical moral issues and intelligence. Very well done.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
" This UK film puts THE WALKING DEAD season 7 to shame
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,9,"This 2016 film with three strong female characters and a story that develops those characters and takes them places you don't expect, and provides a conclusion that startles, but given what you have witnessed, makes perfect sense. The film offers essentially a low tech look at the world of zombie apocalypse; it makes no effort to rely on everincreasing gross out makeup and special effects that sadly TWD has come to rely. As much as I like Andrew Lincoln, at this point in TWD series, I feel he was a better actor in an early UK teleseries AFTERLIFE.I am tired of all the testosterone - Rich, Daryl, whoever the flavor of the season villain is - and the relentless escalation of evil, and acts for which there is no redemption. Sergeant Parks shows growth; as convinced as he is to begin with in treating Melanie as non-human, his final scenes suggest he has come a long way.GEMMA ATHERTON is the nominal star of the film, while the casting of GLENN CLOSE an actress you sometimes love to hate, is inspired. CLOSE, too, comes around, to seeing what we the audience have come to believe. Science is not always reason. But the film belongs to the young actress SENNA MANUA. Mike Carey's gives Ms MANUA a lot to work with; in fact no one is missed out, with the possible exception of what we once called 'the second banana'.COLM MCCARTHY did an excellent job with his actors, and with staging the action, so that we feel a party of the group, and its journey from hell, to god knows where.Technical credits are fine too, especially the music. The fact that enormous resources have not been WASTED on ghoulish makeup is A REMINDER THAT THESE PEOPLE - MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN - were once just like us (And what are We in this year of the Lord 2017?)"
" Not Worth The Time
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,1,"The problem with this movie is that it has been done before, but much better. It starts out well, but it never really develops into a substantive plot. There is never any real clear objective and the ending is rushed to the point where nothing is truly clear. I would pass this one up and look for something else."
" different Zombie movie
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,7,"Bit different to the usual zombie movie \ TV show.British Zombies like to run, and run fast. I like the way they change pretty instantly so there's no crying while holding a recently deceased in your arm before they turn. The just turn straight away. But the main difference is the girl and her classmates, which i think is a nice idea.Interesting plot, different take on a market overloaded with zombies, weak ending. The ending was a disappointment, but maybe I didn't understand it, it just didn't make much sense to me and felt like nobody writing it had a clear idea how it should end so they just went with the only suggestion given."
" Refreshingly Different Spin on Zombie Movies!!!
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,9,"The flesh-eating zombies in ""Outcast"" director Colm McCarthy's dystopian horror chiller ""The Girl with All the Gifts"" are classified as 'hungries.' Nevertheless, make no mistake, these 'hungries' are indeed zombies, but they aren't ""Night of the Living Dead"" carbon copies. McCarthy's above-average film has more on its mind that the usual gratuitous blood, gory, and violence."" Mind you, the hungries can be a ravenous horde, and they aren't confined to adults. Some of the smartest as well as notorious hungries turn out to be children. No, you won't suffer from nightmares after watching this tense action movie, but McCarthy and novelist Mike Carey have successfully tweaked the genre with their vision. The chief difference between these zombies and most of the George Romeo descendants is that they suffer from a fungal infection instead of a viral one. These hungries are different, too, because they aren't constantly roaming in search of meat. They lapse into the equivalent of mannequins and they aren't easily awakened unless intruders stare them in the eyes or make a lot of noise. During one suspenseful scene, our heroes literally walk among them without antagonizing them! Once these hungries have digested their food, they awaken only after they caught a whiff of flesh and go into a frenzy in their search for dinner In this instance, emphasis falls on a precocious young girl Melanie (newcomer Sennia Nanua) who lives in a grim, foreboding research compound that looks like something out of GuantÃ¡namo Bay. Melanie isn't alone. She is one of many juveniles imprisoned who are decked out in orange jump suits and are restrained in wheel chairs. Not only are their wrists strapped down, but also their ankles are securely fastened. Finally, they are strapped across the foreheads. They evoke memories of Hannibal Lector when he was trussed up and moved out of his cell. Oddly enough, all these kids are rolled into a class room where they are taught by a sensitive lady, Helen Justineau (Gemma Arterton of ""A Quantum of Solace"") who treats them with compassion. Helen violates the rules occasionally to the chagrin of the guards, and we are shown why excites these apparently sedate children. When the armed guards that patrol the compound awaken these unusual youngsters in the morning for school, gruff Sergeant Eddie Parks (Paddy Considine of ""The Bourne Ultimatum"") calls them ""abortions."" One soldier enters each room and straps a child down, while another soldier draws a bead on the child. Melanie appears to be Helen's star student. The chief scientist at the compound, Dr. Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close of ""Dangerous Liaisons""), is on the verge of finding a cure for the fungal infection when an army of hungries besiege the compound and then breach it.Sergeant Parks, Dr. Caldwell, Melanie, and Helen with a couple of soldiers survive this onslaught of hungries and cruise off into the wilderness in a truck. Eventually, after the hungries attack them again when they are filling their canteens, our heroes are forced to head out of foot. Melanie turns into a kind of scout for them because she can smell her kind when they are about to feed. Quaintly enough, our heroes have a lotion that they can apply that cuts down on the succulent smell of their flesh. Melanie points out later that the hungries can smell that stench, and they know that humans are within killing distance. Like the vampires in the ""Twilight"" franchise, Melanie is willing to stoop to animals for prey rather than humans. Essentially, she turns into a scout for our heroes who are gradually whittled down. The ending of ""The Girl with All the Gifts"" is as unusual as this zombie-type movie is refreshingly different. Sennia Nanua makes a compelling and convincing screen debut. Zombie aficionados should find enough to assuage their appetites with his British spin on the undead."
" Watch it blind
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,7,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film but if possible I would recommend watching it whilst knowing as little as possible about it. The first part of the film is so much better that way. I didn't even know what genre it was and the suspense was killing me. I would give it a more in depth review but that would kind of ruin my point. Anyway, if possible watch it without finding out anything. Don't look at reviews, don't watch the trailer, don't even find out what genre it's in. You'll thank me later."
" The first step towards the new order after a great disaster.
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,7,"A dystopian British film. Zombie theme based on the book of the same name. The story of a few survivours, but all the focus was on the little girl. Thematically a very familiar film, but the storyline from the characters' perspective makes it unique. Nice cast, but it was not about Gemma Arterton. Her part was small, despite she can be seen in the film's entire stretch.At the beginning, I did not know what's happening. Only after the second stage of the story commence, most of the doubts were cleared. But again, till the final scene, the film holds us with the strong progression. In some parts, it looks silly, but makes sense on the basis of its all the developments.After their enclosure was broke, a group of survivours roams around the London looking for the food and the safe place. They manage to get away in some of the close encounters with the running deads. But how long it goes like that becomes the question. Besides, they divide when the girl comes into their topic. How the story ends was with a small twist.There were some good zombie films in the last two years. This is one of those. If you like zombie theme, you might find it a refreshing. Not the storywise, but the characters. The little kid was so good. They have picked the right one for that role. Looks like it could be a cult film. Ends high, but I don't think there will be any sequel or prequel in the future. Definitely worth a try.7/10"
" This movie took a grand theme and turned it into a small, squalid clichÃ©.
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,3,"If you've read the book you'll find that the movie is, at heart, a completely different story. And I don't mean minor changes like reversing the races of Melanie and Miss Justineau. I mean deep, fundamental changes that alter the entire message of the story; changes that turn the hero into the villain and the villain into a pathetic tragic hero, and turn a story about hope coming in strange packages into something entirely different.The book is--in spite of its setting and genre--a deep and thought-provoking look at what it really means to be human. The movie is not. It's just another zombie movie with a (not even too surprising, in the context of the movie) twist.This movie wastes the abilities of a very talented group of actors. Melanie and Miss Justineau have a bit more depth than the other characters, but Seargent Parks--who is very deep and well-drawn in the book--is reduced to a cardboard-cutout of a soldier. Gallagher--also a multi-faceted character with his own moral message in the novel--becomes nothing more than a means of bringing us to the movie's climax which itself is wildly different than the book. Dr. Carter is humanized in ways totally at odds with the book, and in fact becomes the ""hero"" of the story, if you can call anyone a hero. And Melanie...well, in the end Melanie is cast as the villain, performing roughly the same actions as she did in the book but with totally different motivations.All in all, it was a huge disappointment. I was willing to deal with many major plot cuts--I understand that movies simply cannot fit all the material of novel-length works into their time-frame. What I was not willing to accept was the complete reversal of the message of the book...which was this: Pandora opened the box containing all the ills of the world. But she didn't do it as vengeance or out of a feeling of moral superiority...she did it out of pure curiosity. And the result was horrific. She unleashed plague. She unleashed and pestilence and death and destruction. But...she also released hope.This movie took a grand theme and turned it into a small, squalid clichÃ©. If you loved the book, don't bother. (But do look for the cast, who did an amazing job with the little they had to work with--in other roles.)"
" Worthy Addition to the Zombie Genre
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,7,"I was perusing Amazon Prime videos-as I tend to do-just looking for more obscure and lesser known movies. I saw this movie was about zombies and I was all in. The movie takes place in England so immediately there are thoughts of 28 Days Later. The entire country, less a few, have been infected by a brain eating fungus that causes the infected to become a flesh eating zombie. Amongst the living and the undead are a group of kids that were born from infected mothers. They aren't free of the infection, hence they have a blood lust, but they can operate normally.The story follows a little girl named Melanie (Sennia Nanua). She wants desperately to be normal. A doctor, Dr. Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close), needs her for the cure. Unfortunately, using her for a cure will mean her demise.I thought it was a wonderful story and probably a first with the idea of what you can call half-zombies. There have been movies before in which people have been carriers but not affected (ala I Am Legend, 28 Weeks Later and others). But I can't think of a zombie movie in which the infected only exhibit the signs of the infection some of the time.The movie had a nice flow to it. Of course there was plenty of blood and zombie feasting. This was a worthy addition to the zombie genre."
" A high anxiety pressure cooker of a survival film! Imaginative & Suspenseful!
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,8,"I was taken in by the trailer for this near distant future zombie type film. I do not seek out zombie films. Truth be told I'm much more of a Vampire fan myself but will not turn down a chance to see a good one. This was a very good one.Girl with all the gifts will please most zombie film & show fans as well as others who love a good nerve racking time in the sci fi horror genres. The conflict presented of course is the young girl(strong lead actress) who is infected but human enough to understand her condition and the unfolding dangerous situation. The survivors who fear her as much as they fear exterior threats in the dim future they live in.An nice variety of fine acting, compelling story, good scares as well as action. Well worth going over my max rental budget $5.99. Hope this helped"
" Good until the bad ending
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,6,"There's a lot of reaches going on in this horror/zombie flick. You can suspend your disbelief on some but not on others. To tell you the truth though, I might not have watched it, if I hadn't seen Glenn Close was in the flick. First of all, when you establish the parameters of a pathogen and/or parasitic affliction, especially one as physically active as the one in this movie, you got to stick with it. There were too many departures here from that, especially near the ending. For the most part the movie progressed well and held the attention of this viewer. But then the final half hour or so had some strong departures from the behavior of the girl, and her affliction. And finally, we had a massive one at the very end. Glenn Close was excellent, as she always is. I haven't seen her in a very very long time. In my mind as it was with many, I thought she was either the best, or very close to Streep, as being the best actress in Hollywood in the 80's. Hopefully this is a sign that we will see more of her again. The other roles were also well performed, with the exception of Anthony Welsh, who was a little too overacted in his role. Fisayo Akinade as Melanie was very well done. Child acting, and bringing a believable performance, especially with her character's affliction is difficult, and she pulled it off. This is even with script departures that were not believable. Is this worth the watch? If you like good endings, no. If you like believable ones, certainly not. For the first time in a while, I have to give this a don't watch rating, if the totality of the movie is the gauge. As a time waster its alright. I think, or at least I am hopeful, that we are coming to an end of the zombie genre in pictures. The shelf life on dystopian humans escaping into the ruined world,to find a cure, is at the end of its shelf life. Pretty much as the subject matter creatures are in these flicks. Time to stick a fork in it, and do something else in horror."
" Very good movie great story vastly superior to most of the genre
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,9,"Great British Movie one of the best movies of this type. Gemma Arterton is excellent as protective and caring psychologist/teacher.Dr Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close) convinces. The opening sequence sets the tone. Melanie, a young, polite, and courteous girl manacles herself into a wheel chair. She seems entirely innocent and harmless, yet her captors fear otherwise. She and other children, each similarly restrained, are given an armed escort to a classroom. It's an arresting start and it grabs our attention. Sennia Nanua plays Melanie and the story revolves around her. We watch society collapsing through her eyes, see her threatened by the human beings around her, and fear for her. We watch her do terrible things, and yet we root for her. Everything is uncertain. Nothing is as it seems. It's a brilliant performance from a new talent, and it serves the film perfectly. Nice finish to the movie not as expected."
" Similar to The Last of Us
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,6,"I went into this film with low expectations but it was alright actually. I would say there isn't enough action for my liking. Paddy Considine is good. Glenn Close is good. The little girl is annoying but I can see why so many people rate her highly. I personally think Gemma Arterton is amazing so she never does any wrong in my eyes. The film for me was almost using all the elements of the video game The Last of Us but just not as good, it's a really similar story. If you liked that game you'll more than likely like this. I think 6/10 is generous, Gemma Arterton counts for two of those stars. It is a ""fresh"" perspective on the zombie franchise and of the two I've seen this year; the new Resident Evil being the other, I prefer this. I'll finish by saying go and buy a PlayStation and buy The Last of Us, you'll get more out of it. Good effort from all involved though."
" It's Different.
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,6,"Since I'm a fan of good zombie films I was a little excited about seeing this one, although the infected in this film weren't really zombies. The apocalyptic feel that was delivered in this film was average but the story as a whole put a different twist to the zombie genre and that's one thing I really liked about this film but like most zombie films, this film did have some predictable parts in it like you pretty much knew who was going to die and who was going to be spared because of a connection between characters. Although this film is categorized as a horror it's not scary and it doesn't have to be and I don't think that's what the writers and the director of this film was trying to do. It shoes the compassion and soft side of a little girl and what kind of agenda could be inside of her at the same time. If you like zombie films I recommend this one."
" Masterpiece
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,10,"The Girl with all the Gifts is as refreshingly original and comprehensive as a movie can get about zombies. I loved it so much that it prompted me to join IMDb so I could give it a 10 star stellar review.From the very beginning the movie creates intrigue. I could go on and on about how great this movie is, but will just suffice to say it's never slow and never predictable. It blew my mind. It's a fast hour and 51 minutes and it is terrific. It is dark, bleak and the visual effects of a destroyed London will stay in my mind for quite a while. The performances are very good. The little girl has great screen presence. I cared about what happened to the characters throughout and I didn't spend a second of this movie bored. If you are a fan of thriller movies you should see it. You have to."
" Not a patch on the book
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,2,"The zombies look like people on a night out to a Halloween party. I think they might all have been issued light grey and dark grey face paint and told to 'zombie-up.' Obviously during the zombie apocalypse, there is still room for zombie artistic licence as none of them behave the same way when moving which is odd because you'd have thought they were all infected with the same zombie virus. Apparently, it comes in various strains from the 'Michael Jackson Thriller' through to'Dame Thora Hurd Mounting a Chair Lift'. I couldn't stand the acting skills, or lack there off, of the girl. If - you - like - your - lines - delivered - in - the - style - of - the - monosyllabic - girl - from - 28 - days - later -when - she - was - on - drugs - then - this - is - the - film - for - you. I prefer a bit of a more cogent delivery that doesn't have me wish to become a bran dead zombie before the film ends. I gave up and walked out before the end... I'm glad it wasn't shown in America... it's an entirely embarrassing film that shows just what you can get away with in the UK with enough lottery and charity money... I presume this, because I can't actually envisage any actually right-minded investor looking to set fire to a few bucks in the direction of this boring tripe.And PLEASE find some more locations next time- shooting around the same site in the back waters of Birmingham became a bit tedious after the millionth time the same corner had been rounded from a new angle."
" Casting gone wrong/bad story development/ out of context from the main source( book )
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,3,"The original story from the book was rich with proper details engaging wordplay and thrilling scenarios that I though that there is no way they could make a bad movie out it even if it is not as good as the book the movie would still be at least satisfying if not as good but I don't know how the director still managed to screw it up, although it was Colt Mcarthy so I kinda saw it coming.The screenplay is really bad, I had no one to root for in the entire movie, the climax scene that should have come as a shock/surprise was completely bland and uninteresting and kinda predictable. Characters that should have been given a proper introduction were completely missed out on. The logic behind the hungries not reacting to footsteps is beyond me ( people in the book walk far away from them not through the hungry herd ) The characters have not been developed properly, the story arc is not proper at all. the movie is too much fast paced and doesn't give the audience to think about anything or any character at any point whatsoever And finally the casting choice was just bloody awful ( I'm not saying that the actors were bad, but only that the they weren't suited for these roles at all ) like Melanie in the book is a white blonde girl and is only 10 years old and far more innocent than what is depicted in the movie( which in turn would have delivered a proper and surprising ending as is in the book) another example : miss Justineau is a black woman and a little more mature and short tempered (mostly towards parks and Caldwell), Gallagher is a young white man, Sargent Parks has a scar on his face.( I'm surprised on how this movie has a 6+ rating even now, how did they manage to get Gemma Arterton on board for this pile of crap movie, and why on earth is this movie nominated for a BAFTA ??? )"
" Well plotted, well acted

I'm a (news/nonfiction) writer with a weakness for SciFi. I thought this was a fantastic film. I've read the other critical reviews on IMDb, but I think that anyone who likes a good trip into an imaginary world will enjoy The Girl with All the Gifts. Extraordinarily well acted and original."
" After the First Act the Tropes are Trotted Out Nonstop

Retaining Cognitive Abilities, Unlike other ""Normal"" Hungries. Unfortunately Her Brain is Coveted by Glenn Close as a Scientist Trying to Find a Cure.After the First Act, that is the Best of the Three, Things Devolve at a Fast Pace and the Film becomes Less Intriguing and the Tropes are Trotted Out Nonstop.The Zombie/Hungries are a Recycled Bunch, as are All of the Kills and the Intriguing Premise is Left Blowing in the Wind. Above Average for its Type, but Consider its Type. Definitely Worth a Watch for Fans, but Others are Unlikely to be Persuaded to Join the Herd of Genre Followers that are being Culled by Endless Entries."
" intriguing start but needs an exposition
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,6,"Melanie is one of the children carefully restrained in a military bunker. They are feared by the soldiers guarding them such as Sgt. Eddie Parks (Paddy Considine). Their teacher Helen Justineau (Gemma Arterton) is touched by Melanie. The kids are actually experiments being conducted by Dr. Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close). The world has been devastated by a fungus which turns people into mindless killing zombies called Hungries.The first twenty minutes start off great like an intriguing Twilight Zone episode. There is a point in the movie where an imaginative exposition is needed by Caldwell to explain the world and her experiment. I'm reminded of Hammond from Jurassic Park. When Caldwell brings in Melanie tied down on the gurney, it's the perfect spot where she could have done a presentation to a bunch of military brass. Instead, the audience has to piece this world together bit by bit. I do have problems with some of the pieces. They don't all fit together neatly. There is a final reveal that stretches the fit to its limit. There is a compelling battle for the humanity of Melanie between Miss Justineau and Caldwell but it needs some better writing. Despite the movie's shortcomings, it takes an interesting spin on the standard zombie genre."
" Same ol' same ol'

Same ol' fast moving zombies that hiss after standing still for 2 seconds before running after something they see that they want to eat... same ol' people with guns with unlimited bullets walking tirelessly into abandoned cities... same ol' ridiculously super-powered zombies that, theoretically, would not be able to move their bodies in such a manner because decomposed tissue is WEAK (not strong)... same ol' confused storyline where the author/director cannot make up his mind if he wants the zombies to be dumb or smart... same ol' CRAP.In the beginning of the movie the children seem to be well-educated in CHEMISTRY... yet in the middle of the movie the scientist says ""do you know what symbiosis is?"" ----- The child knows all about the periodic table and has an extensive vocabulary, but is so stupid she has never even heard of ""symbiosis""...?

NO it's not full of scares and gory zombie kills... that's not what it's about. If you can appreciate a good story about a little girl who happens to be a zombie then you'll see the beauty in this film. There still GREAT zombie action though...

",2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"Let me say first that I am not a fan of zombie movies. Since George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"", most have been derivative. There have been some better than others (so I've been told) but none that really stand out from the pack. I think, though, that ""The Girl with All the GIfts"" is one that does stand out in this genre. I read about it and decided to take a chance on it...I figured if I didn't like it that I would just fast forward it and be done with it in about 15 minutes. So I took it out from my local library. Well, I got hooked from the beginning. I would recommend that if you want an interesting, unexpectedly well done movie then give this movie a chance"

" Making and breaking
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,8,"A movie can become more than it is, if the ending gives you what you needed. But it can also fall flat on its belly, if you think they messed it up. And I can see how people are not liking the last portion of the film. But not liking and saying the movie did something it didn't are two different things.But let's rewind and take this suspenseful horror from the beginning. Yes we do know things are not good and we do realize things might get worse. Or will they? And where are we going or rather the movie? It takes a lot on and it has the acting talent at hand to move things along nicely. It does not pull any punches and while the ending may feel weird, it's still linked thematically and does fit into the whole thing. That doesn't mean you have to like it - but don't blame the movie or the pace. Like it or not, it is what it is"

This film started out great, and had a different concept that has not been used yet such as fungal disease that has caused the apocalypse and zombies known as ""hungries."" And than there is children, who are infected and craves for the living but are able to think and learn. That's not a bad start learning the direction on were the movie is going. The plot follows Helen (Gemma Arterton) a teacher, who is the instructor to a group of kids at a military base. These kids are locked in cells and prepare themselves to be restraint on chairs and know the drill on when classes begin. Then, there is a bright student Melanie (Sennia Nanua) that Helen grows fond of. Dr. Caldwell (Glenn Close) is a scientist that is trying to find a way to reverse this disease by putting these kids through experiments. When everything falls apart, as the zombies break into the military base. And Helen and Melanie are tagged along with Sgt. Eddie (Paddy Considine) and Dr. Caldwell as they escape the base. Their goal is to find the next beacon on were the military base is and to survive the apocalypse. It had a great concept idea with the whole fungal disease turning people into zombies and how the stages of the disease is evolving with pods that grow around buildings that eventually release pores. Sounds similar to a video game like The Last of Us. The Girl with All the Gifts is based on a novel which tried to throw a spin to the zombie genre involving the second generation of children that seem normal but have an appetite for the living. Gemma Arterton, Paddy Considine, and Glenn Close are decent with their performances. The script by M.R. Carey does not add any characterization to the characters, which makes them quite dull and forgettable. Sennia Nanua who plays Melanie, did a decent job with her character as well. The film started out good but it all comes crumpling so fast in the second act to the end. Basically, when Helen and Sgt. Eddie are rescued by Melanie as she becomes the alpha against these group of zombie children. And she is all roaring at the zombie kids, which becomes cheesy and ridiculous on were the direction goes from there. The ending is just dumb without giving away spoilers but it turned a horror drama film that could have had potential into a ridiculous movie. I will not recommend this film to any fans of the zombie genre. Sure, there are other better films either like 28 Days Later or its sequel. Or even Dawn of the Dead that is by far the best so far. Overall, The Girl with All the Gifts is a boring film that had a great idea but it does not go anywhere with its lackluster script, dull acting, and a direction that went from being a thriller to laugh out loud stupid ending."
" Excellent!
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,10,Personally i really enjoyed watching this movie. It is indeed a bit zombie like but instead its about a fungus that infects the brain.The cinematics are excellent. Great views and very good audio. The story is well put together and consistent. More so the acting... i really love the way they play so real. Even the kids are super good acting.It was only not easy for me to find a place to watch it. I seen the add on facebook but i couldn't open the account in the Netherlands to watch it. Finally got it by my television provider.The scenes are a bit grey and green... but very pittoresque!Me being a zombie movie fan and with this beautiful production and acting is giving it a 10 out of a 10. Sorry i am not much of a critic today.
" Just another Zombie movie
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,3,"Here I thought this was a savior movie like Ultraviolet infected with a virus that gives her superhuman powers has to protect a boy who is thought to be carrying antigens that would benefit all humanity.The Girl with All the Gifts is a quick study of her captors , and uses this to her advantage and the advantage of the next dominant spices. Not my cup of tea. Zombie fans will enjoy this new twist on the genera."
" Reason for DVD release
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,4,"If you're like me and base a lot off of previews then you'd know this looked great regardless of mixed reviews. Well, this one is an example of what could have been great. Plot was going well and so was intensity until the last 20 minutes, where the film fell completely flat. Like they ran out of time and script. What were they thinking?! Last portion of the film was a mix of walking dead, Peter Pan , and just a blob of crap. It was random and senseless in the last 10 minutes. Just stupid. And the very last scene tried to transfer the over all feel of the film from horror/thriller to happily ever after. Felt more like a long, dark episode of Saturday night live"
" A dark, gritty take on the zombie genre
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,7,"I eagerly anticipated the US DVD release date on this movie, as the previews made it look amazing. The book (by Mike Carey) was incredible - one of the best I've read in a while, keeping me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I had incredibly high hopes for The Girl With All The Gifts, which may have contributed (rather heavily, perhaps) to a lower rating than I would have predicted.PROS: For a low-budget film this is very well shot, ranging from very stark, cold, uninviting scenes to a few that showed real softness, love and deep emotion. The acting was solid throughout, with Sennia Nanua stealing the show despite her undeservedly low billing.CONS: There is only one negative aspect of this film that I can find, and it is an issue that hamstrings any film adaptation of a truly outstanding book - the film is too short. Obviously there are always practical limitations, as no studio would fund a six-hour movie just so fans of the book can witness the deep character development that they loved in the book, and I believe that TGWATG would have a much higher score overall if the studio invested more and allowed the main characters to fully develop and make the story line much more full.SUMMARY: TGWATG is a very well-produced movie and a great continuation of the zombie genre, especially given its low budget. Give it a chance, and if it piques your interest at all, go read the book."
" Almost good
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,6,"I'll give it a notch above average because it is almost an original type of zombie movie...if there is such a thing anymore. But it has several problems which detract from the film's impact. The biggest problem is the credibility of the the behavior exhibited by the characters. Given the life or death situation of the story, it is hard to believe several of the people in the story act as casually or as naively as they do, which is a shame as it really reduces the story's impact. This is probably the reason critics and viewers have posted unfavorable reviews on this site. Better screen writing would have made this a very good horror drama, but the glaring missives make this more of an average film than it otherwise would have been. A pit!"
" Quality and different zombie film
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,7,"It's a zombie film but with enough about it to be not only different from the bulk of the rest but much better too. There's essentially two types of zombie here. There's the regular type and a group of kids who are half way between zombie and human and are the subject of the film.There's good acting from the cast with the main character of the half zombie girl played by Sennia Nanua the stand out. The sets where nature is reclaiming urbanisation are very good too. All in the movie draws you in to actually caring for the characters. Sadly this is a trait all too missing from many films.The ending is well disguised and I'll not spoil it here for the viewer. All in a quality film with a good story, well acted and well told. Recommended."
" But it started out so great...
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,5,"I had been warmly recommended that I watch ""The Girl with All the Gifts"" given my love for the zombie genre, and it was a movie that had somewhat managed to fly under my radar, for some reason.So I took the advice to heart and sat down to watch the movie. And I will say that the movie does start out quite alright, especially because the audience is sort of kept in the dark as director Colm McCarthy slowly and steadily builds up the story. And that uncertainty and only speculating at what is going on really helps to add drama to the movie.Then the movie takes a turn into a zombie movie with the outbreak and overrunning of the military compound. And this is where the movie really picked up pace for me and where it was the most interesting.However, it all came crashing down so hard, so very, very hard. And it came at the point where the children from ""Beyond Thunderdome"" made an appearance. That was just idiotic and such a poor turn of events to the story. And that totally left the movie in shattered pieces, and it never recovered from that blow. From that point on and to the end of the movie, it was just a slippery downhill slope that the movie had no chance of getting back up from.Now, for a zombie movie, then ""The Girl with All the Gifts"" was sort of testing the waters with new ideas, and for most parts it did manage to prove potential and would have pulled it off, except that the movie took a critical hit and never recovered from it.The special effects were good, and they did carry the movie a good long way. That is a given for a zombie movie, because special effects and whether or not they are believable or impressive is a make or break thing for the zombie genre, as it is less forgiving than most other genres.""The Girl with All the Gifts"" started out with lots of potential and was fast on the climb, but then it was all too soon and too tragically cut short by some laughable and idiotic turn of events and ill-thought ideas that were brought to the script. I can only imagine that they were concocted through some fever-stricken haze.And the end of the movie, well I will not even comment on that. It was just so idiotic that it doesn't even deserve the time or effort.This 2016 movie ends up with a barely mediocre rating in my opinion, narrowly managing to climb up to a, and I am being more than generous here, 5 out of 10 star rating."
" Refreshingly original, for a zombie horror flick!
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,9,"'THE GIRL WITH ALL THE GIFTS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A post-apocalyptic zombie horror flick, directed by first time feature filmmaker Colm McCarthy, a veteran TV director, and written by Mike Carey, who also wrote the book it's based on (at the same time). The movie stars newcomer Sennia Nanua, Gemma Arterton, Paddy Considine and Glenn Close. It's set in a future world that's been infected by a fungal virus which has turned most of the population into zombies. Humanity is now relying on a second generation of hybrid children, that can still think and learn, especially one special girl. The film has received mostly positive reviews form critics, and it's available to watch on video on demand. I really enjoyed it. Most of the population has been turned into zombies (nicknamed 'hungries') by a powerful fungal infection. Dr. Caroline Caldwell (Close) is a scientist that's desperately trying to find a cure for the infection, by studying hybrid second generation children (which can think and learn). The children go to a school at a military base, ran by Sgt. Eddie Parks (Considine), where they're kept prisoners. They're educated by a teacher named Helen Justineau (Arterton), who has a special bond with a very special young girl, named Melanie (Nanua). When the zombies overrun the base, everything suddenly changes.The film is really well directed, and acted; especially by newcomer Sennia Nanua. It's also refreshingly original, for a zombie horror flick. I definitely can't say I've seen another one like it. It's emotional, and full of touching drama; and you also learn to really care about all of the main characters. It's also got plenty of zombie action, and gruesome gore. It's a zombie movie that pretty much has everything you could possibly want in a zombie movie (almost, but not quite).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b6j-_hcq7Wo"
" An innovative gem of the zombie genre
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,8,"It's more or less modern UK, and it's at apogee of a zombie apocalypse. The remaining humans are scattered across several military bases, surrounded by constantly amassing hordes and with no long-term chance of survival. The only hope for humans is the vaccine, and to develop it they need the second-generation zombies. However, there's a tiny little detail: those zombie kids actually look and behave like regular children. Well, at least while not hungry...The zombie movies have been with us for several decades already, and during that time the zombie concept has evolved drastically: from a slow-walking dead corpse, to a running corpse, to a super-strong killing machine with teamwork traits. But all these changes never affected the way humans deal with the zombies - it was always the same old shoot-run-hide game. Of course, there are some notable exceptions, like Shaun of the Dead or an alternative ending to I Am Legend, but they were just tweaking the minor details without changing the big picture. There's also Warm Bodies, but that's essentially a fairy tale. The main principle remained: that no matter how complex the zombies have become to keep the audience's interest, they were always an enemy, no questions asked. And that was the solid rule. Until now.No, The Girl with All the Gifts does not try to simply whitewash the infected and make us feel bad for them. In fact, most of the zombies - this time called hungries - shown here are still mindless predators motivated by nothing but the smell of living flesh. But the film dares to take one step further and assume that no matter what kind of infection causes humans to turn into these uncontrollable beasts, there still might be something sentient left in them, and, in some cases, that sentient side expresses itself in very non-trivial ways.The main achievement of the film is that, for the first time in the history of the genre, it's not simply about humans and their survival. This time we get to see the other side of the story, and learn how it is to be an infected - and to combine the typical bloodlust of a walking corpse with the typical curiosity and desire to explore the world pertinent to a child. What starts as a simple ""us versus them"", gradually transforms into ""us with them"", and maybe even ""us for them"". And we learn that, just like Paddy Considine's character says, there are no good or bad people - we all just do what's in us to do. In that sense, the only ""bad"" thing about zombies is that they hunt us - but they do that simply to survive, just like we humans do. So are we really that different? And do we have more right to survive than them?I'll be honest: this film is far from perfect. In addition to the classic list of zombie inconsistencies, it creates a number of its own. And the flaws of the model in which the film's universe is supposed to exist are quite obvious. More to it, using children to weaken our emotional guard and make us more sympathetic is kind of a low blow. But maybe it's a blessing in disguise, because, even though we see those children kill and devour others, including our own, we can't help appreciating that there's more to them than just hunger or self-defense. That, no matter what their nature dictates and no matter how clearly they realize that in that cruel world there's probably no place for both hungries and humans, they can care for us, and sometimes even suffer for us fighting against their own. And even if the world as we know it is bound to die, as if all the woes from Pandora's box have been unleashed on it, that unlikely temporary bond leaves a place for the warm feeling called hope. Hope that even the end of the world might not be the end."
" The Girl without any Gifts!
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,3,"I lurked in to watch this British zombie flick with the names Glenn Close and Gemma Arterton; and with the fact that it got an above average rating. The movie starts interesting enough to make you want to watch and try to understand what is going on. As soon as you see a soldier bringing his arm closer to a student and the child starting to kick and stamp to bite him, it hits you that it is going to be a another (not so interesting) zombie movie. After fifteen minutes, I was bored. In addition, the most disturbing part of the movie was all-intact-zombies! Without any missing limbs, and a very bad make up, you just feel that zombies are actually normal people standing here and there, and trying to act like a zombie. Zombies were cheap and not so realistic; and they were like jumped out off a 40 year old movie. I cannot find any good reason to watch a movie, where the main attraction to impress the audience fails to do so. The girl who was supposed to have all the gifts was nothing more than a failed plot. I cannot help but thinking that GeMma Arterton and Glenn Close were just used in the movie for marketing. Their acting were (of course) good, but I do not know if this really matters as the movie was below their talent."
" Not bad for a zombie movie
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,6,"At one point you would think that you saw it all when it's about zombies. There are so much movies made about this subject that you can't imagine it's going to be something different this time. But in The Girl With All The Gifts it is a bit different and that is at least a bit refreshing. But it is still about zombies, well Hungry's in this case, so if you don't like this subject I wouldn't watch it. But if you're into this genre then it's worth a watch. I thought the beginning was promising and intriguing. There are a lot of kids playing in it and they were okay. The rest of the cast was also okay. There is of course a lot of biting and blood but not those gory details that you normally have in more hardcore zombie movies. The story is of course easy to follow but not boring. Good entertainment for zombie lovers."
" A realistic zombie movie that is slower paced and much more dramatic than the standard type.
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,6,"""What am I?"" Humanity has been taken over by a quick spreading fungal disease that turns humans into flesh eating ""hungries"". Together Caroline, a scientist (Close) and Helen, a teacher (Arterton) travel to a school where a young girl named Melanie is at. This girl seems immune from the disease and the group decides to take Melanie far away for her safety, but Caroline's true intentions are something much different. This is a yet another zombie movie. On the other hand, this is an almost realistic zombie movie. By that I mean that, much like the way I felt about Maggie, is that if zombies actually existed I feel it would be more like this. This is more of a drama and character study than a full out action/kill all the zombies type movie that seems to be the norm. All that being said, I am just not a zombie movie guy and really struggled to get into this. Fans of this type of movie may enjoy this more than me though. Overall, a realistic zombie movie that is slower paced and much more dramatic than the standard type. I give this a C."
" Surprisingly Excellent
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie was simply excellent. Going into the movie I really thought this was going to be a mediocre B-movie. But it was much better than I expected. Acting was above average with no big name stars, but the story line and concept were an amazing twist to the stale genre. Highly recommend checking it out."
" good effects and story for a low budget
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,7,"You should see this flick they said, it's a horror flick. Been seen at a lot of festivals and starring Glenn Close. I don't think so and the pictures I saw didn't made me go eager to see it but knowing me I did give it a try and yes, it's indeed a horror with a drama overtone.It reminded me a lot of the much acclaimed series The Walking Dead, you know, hunt and shoot those walkers down. Here we don't have zombies but infected but hey what's the difference. It all starts rather simple and it took a bit before things go almost wrong and from then on it's a pure horror with some stunning effects for a low budget.Even clocking in just under two hours didn't bored me at all and there's a lot of talking going on. And in the talking lays the drama. It's not going to be for everyone due the message being said with this picture but if you can stand that you're in for a good treat. And children being the worst infected here does add towards the horror.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5"
" I'm sorry but I REALLY have to disagree
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,5,"I'm quite shocked at how well reviewed this film is. I'll agree that the very beginning of the movie creates intrigue and interest, the main young girl does a good job and the ending holds some measure of interest even if it is quite laughable. But that said, the rest was really pretty bad. People reacted to situations completely unrealistically, mainly doing stuff that was BOUND to get them into trouble. Acting was only so so - although I would categorize Gemma Arterton as actually BAD, and there were some laugh out loud unintentional comic moments. I fail to see how this gets a score of 6.7. No, scratch that, I fail to see how very few are commenting on the film's obvious flaws. I mean, by all means watch it - it's entertaining enough, but the writing, dialogue and acting is as corny as any horror movie that usually receives a 4.7 rating. I guess I'll get me coat now."
" lugubrious
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,3,"This one left me with really and unpleasant taste in my mouth. The sensation that I'm actually a worse person for having watched through this weirdness.Things just don't seem explained enough and the movie takes itself way too seriously. It's not clear why Glenn Close needs to kill the girl to make the antidote.Melodramatic, drawn-out and depressing."
" Great CGI - good acting - story needs work
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,7,"This film started off well - dark and strange. I was curious about what was going on. Not having done any research before hand helped, although I knew it was some type of Zombie movie.I liked the premise and The Girl (Melanie) was well embodied by the actor Sennia. Fast zombies are cool and the make-up and special effects were excellent. Gore level was sufficient for my taste too.I don't usually like child actors but Sennia didn't grate on me at all - until the scene where she fought the child leader and then dominated the feral kids by growling at them. I found this horribly over-long, embarrassing and cringe-worthy. There are a thousand ways to show dominance so why can't directors and produces repair a scene that just doesn't work. There's a few clichÃ© moment that us Zombie film overs are getting sick of. You don't split up and leave your weapons on the ground while you ferret through a newsagent. You don't just decided to wander in among a thousand enemy unless you have a desperate need to do so. How hard would it be to manufacture a real reason for the group to need to do that? I could think of a dozen ways off the top of my head.I'm glad Melanie didn't take the 'higher ground' at the end where the doctor almost persuaded her to sacrifice herself. I would have vomited. Taking over the earth for her kind was much smarter play. Not sure that Helen would have been that keen on this choice however, now that she's confined to an air-tight lab for the rest of her life.It's worth a look though for all Zombie lovers."
" A sagging middle is book-ended by an intriguing opening and a thoughtful ending
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,6,"Colm McCarthy's The Girl with All the Gifts, written in novel form and for the screen in tandem by Mike Carey, seems to have aspirations of greatness: To be that great British horror movie many of us are waiting for, and harking back to iconic pieces of horror/science fiction literature such as Richard Matheson's I Am Legend. McCarthy, who has mainly worked for television (directing episodes of Ripper Street, Doctor Who and Peaky Blinders amongst many others), certainly makes a valiant effort to help distinguish the film from a seemingly endless wave of zombie movies, but the plot rarely strays from the tropes of the post-apocalyptic road trip.The titular girl with all the gifts is the exceptionally intelligent Melanie (Sennia Nanua), a child who appears to live in a dark cell within an underground military bunker. She is routinely ushered into English lessons strapped to a wheelchair with her arms, legs and head restrained. We soon learn that such extreme measures are taken because Melanie is a 'hungry' - someone infected by a mysterious fungal disease responsible for turning most of humanity into flesh- eating zombies. Only she is one of a few born infected with the virus who is also capable of interacting with the uninfected, and she and her classmates are believed by Dr. Caldwell (Glenn Close) to be the key to a cure. When the base is attacked by a hoard of the undead, Caldwell flees with Melanie, taking kindhearted teacher Helen (Gemma Arterton) and grizzled soldier Sgt. Parks (Paddy Considine) to find a safe place to finish the experimentation. To her credit, Nanua more than holds her own against seasoned veterans such as Close and Considine, and Melanie's sweet, curious nature combined with her instinct to kill is the film's strongest suit. However, this is more of an ensemble piece, and by taking the attention away from Melanie to focus on explaining the epidemic and placing the group into a simple get-from-A-to-B storyline, it loses its edge. The sagging middle aside - which often feels like a better-filmed episode of The Walking Dead and offers only one memorable set-piece involving a swarm of sleeping living dead - events are book-ended by an intriguing beginning and thoughtful ending. The opening is successful in luring you in before deteriorating into a midst of exposition and gun-fire, and the final moments, which ponder a different kind of future, highlight just how great things could have been."
" Complete Garbage !
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,1,This is possibly the worst movie ever! The concept is just plain stupid! Do not waste your time or money !! Fungus zombie alien tree pods?? How can anyone see this script and think it is a good idea to have their name on this pile of crap!! You will have a better time picking at a scab or driving toothpicks under your nails than you will watching the movie!!
" I SHOULD have looked it up - another stupid zombie movie
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,3,"SO mad at myself for not looking this film up. I despise zombie movies and am looking forward to their fading away to make room for the next fad.Acting was good. Set, directing, etc. I think the writing was good, too - with an unexpected ending. But at its core, it's just another zombie movie. I don't need to watch actors in zombie makeup eat people. I hate that stuff. And the ending may delight some because it's unexpected, but I find it cynical and depressing. The whole film is. Even if those children have promise as the next um... step in evolution, I suppose - they'll end up eating all of the animals and they will starve. Ultimately. And that sweet teacher will die - and that's the end of it all.I want my time and money back. Never again! I'll use movie plot spoiler websites in future.REALLY miss the message boards!"
" Yet another zombie film? Yep. But it'll surprise you ...
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,6,"""She's got a muzzle on her face and her hands are tied behind her back. And you're still afraid of her? Yeah. And you should be, too.""One thing is certain. The zombie concept that's being used in horror movies is far from dead. I always wanted to use this expression in a review about one of the many zombie movies we are confronted with in recent years. And I thought that no film could surpass ""Attack of the lederhosen Zombies"". A horde of bloodthirsty Austrians stumbling over a snowy mountain landscape, being impaled on ski poles and in the end being pulverized by a snowplow. These are perfectly normal events for a zombie movie. The fact that they are mutated because of a chemical substance which is going to be used for the production of artificial snow, is a new original fact. So no nasty virus that causes all the misery this time. Looking back at ""The girl with all the gifts"", I can only admit that they managed once again to portray the world of zombies (or rather ""Hungries"") in an original way. Hence the definition at the beginning.This time it's a sort of fungus that transformed the world population into mindless, comatose creatures with an unquenchable thirst for human blood. The solution can be found at a military base. Young people are subjected to medical tests there, because they may form the basis of a possible remedy for this pandemic. They were born in a sinister way and are partially resistant to the malignant fungus. Although they exhibit symptoms of human-eating half-dead, they still function normally. Melanie (Sennia Nanua) is a highly intelligent girl with a logically working brain. She could well be vital important. Without a doubt, this chapter in the film was the most successful and terrifying part of the entire movie. A bunker-like building with young children locked up in separate cells and who are brought to class on a daily basis, after carrying out the same daily ritual in compliance with strict security measures. As a group of ""Hannibal Lecter""-like psychopaths, they are sitting in the classroom, learning about the Periodic Table. At that moment I started wondering what this was about. Why do those heavily armed soldiers fear these innocent looking children?After a while everything becomes clearer. And then hell breaks loose. This is the start of a survival journey through zombie country, with the aim of reaching a safer place. Among the survivors, who are part of this fleeing group, we find Helen Justineau (Gemma ""Hansel and Gretel : Witch Hunters"" Atterton) and Dr. Caroline Caldwell (Glenn ""The Great Gilly Hopkins"" Close), who have to traverse a post-apocalyptic England, together with a few soldiers. Obviously Melanie is also present since her brain might contain something to solve the whole problem with. The two female members Justineau and Caldwell are diametrically opposed in their opinion about Melanie's destiny. Dr. Melanie Caldwell sees her purely as a scientific object, while Justineau still tries to look at her as a human being. Certainly this creates the necessary ethical and humanitarian conflicts.Nonetheless, first lets praise the creators of this zombie flick who tried to breath new life into this totally milked horror genre. And more importantly, the rather brilliant acting performance of the fledgling Sennia Nanua, who really resembled Rudy Huxtable from ""The Cosby Show"" at certain moments. In a pure and convincing way she shows the inner struggle she's fighting. A cheerful and polite little girl fighting against that constant emerging urge. How Glenn Close (nominated six times for an Academy Award) ended up in this simple zombie flick, remains a mystery to me. And her acting isn't groundbreaking either, so to say.Personally I thought the first part of the film was intriguing and gripping. This level of fascination drops rapidly in the middle section. The same clichÃ©d happenings as we know them from all the other zombie movies reoccur here. Again the same stupid decisions and not so original confrontations. When an exciting moment commences (like the zombie minefield in the mall), again this is spoiled by incomprehensible facts. Unfortunately, the number of exciting scenes in this film is shockingly limited. Even the scene with Melanie standing face to face with a gang of youthful ""hungries"" (they looked like ""The lost boys"" from Peter Pan) wasn't really successful. But then again, the end was again surprising in a way.All in all, this wasn't a bad movie and they tried to be as original as they could. No, the zombie genre isn't reinvented here. Not even by the use of a different terminology and the introduction of blocker gel. But what makes this film stand out, is the acting of the young protagonist. However, there's one thing that is abundantly clear after watching this quirky zombie. We don't need to worry about one thing. A British zombie invasion won't be caused by the Brexit! Just kidding.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
" A poor adaptation
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,4,"Whenever I watch a movie or TV show that adapts a book or comic I've read I expect it to be true to the source material. This, however, is not. The changes start out small, but as the movie progresses they become bigger and bigger. First and foremost the change of Melanie's ethnicity. In the book she is described as a bone white, blue eyed blonde. Here she is black. This ""social justice warrior"" casting appears to be becoming a trend with movies and TV nowadays, they've done it with Preacher's Tulip (another blonde) and The Dark Tower's Roland, who is most definitely white (he is supposed to look like a young Clint Eastwood, King himself said he based the character's appearance on him, and in the book his ethnicity plays an important part in his interactions with one of the main characters, but I digress). They also changed Miss Justineau's ethnicity, she is actually black in the book, and I think Gallagher was a redhead, though I'm not positive on that one. Second, there are no ""junkers"". In the book they are survivors that did not go into the safe zones/cities that were set up and survive on their own. They are the ones that attack the base by herding a huge horde of hungries to it and overrunning it. After the small group of survivors escape on a truck they are attacked by hungries while replenishing their water supplies and the truck breaks down. The nature and the timing of it (the breakdown) were also changed. Since there are no junkers hunting them down (like they do in the book) they decide to get to Beacon (the city the people from the base came from) by crossing through London. In the movie they appear to get there almost instantly, while in the book it takes them a couple of days or such, so several key scenes are missing. Also they seem to rush through the rest of the plot and many key elements are missing or were also changed. Doctor Caldwell's knowledge of the fungus that causes the infection is much more advanced in the movie than it is in the book, so many of the things she says, or the explanations she gives (like telling Melanie her origins and what she actually is) are completely different, in the book they come at a much slower pace and some are actually important reveals near the book's climax. After they get to the mobile lab pretty much everything was changed except the attack on Gallagher. The true nature of the threat they are facing, Melanie's actions when confronted to it, doctor Caldwell's actions in the mobile lab and basically everything else following the attack in the market are different, and very much so, except for the very last scene, which is pretty similar to the book's. The technical aspects of the movie are just fine and the city looks great, but the actual adaptation is rather poor. If you haven't read the book this will not be an issue for you, but I cannot overlook it."
" Unique! Well worth watching.
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"This is a very different zombie movie where the infection is caused by a fungus. That's all I'll say about that because I don't want to spoil anything. The film starts deep into the end of human civilization as we know it. Adults infected by the fungus are called hungries. They'll eat any organic matter. When fed, they're docile. But when they smell anything organic their jaws start clacking and they go basically nuts. They are quite horrible looking with fungal growths all over them. At a research facility, where the story begins, Glenn Close (Dr. Caldwell) is trying to find a cure for this disease. Currently it is only transmittable by bite. Gemma Arterton's (Miss Justineau) character is a teacher and her subjects are children. She's formed a bond with Melanie. The children are a secondary infection (although when Glenn explains about them later - it's quite chilling), and can be taught and experimented on. They're fed slugs. The most intelligent of them is Melanie - played by Sennia Nanua, who is absolutely brilliant. Without this young lady this movie fails. She carries her character who, even though she is a second generation hungry, is likable. I have very little to complain about this movie. Some have said the pacing is off, I disagree - the movie flows quite organically. The cast is excellent, especially Paddy Considine as Sgt Eddie Parks. He really hates the hungries and we find out why later in the movie. I won't say more other than this is a damned good movie and well worth watching."
" Good Movie But Fails Dramatically Compared To Its Source Material
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,6,"I have mixed feelings about this one.I have listened to the audiobook a while ago. I don't remember everything but I remember the set pieces. It was a book full of moral ambiguities, with mean people being the good guys and nice ones being the bad ones (I'm not talking about the zombies, I'm talking about the main characters).It was a book where the jerk was doing what's right, where the sociopath was just trying to save the human race and where the nice and loving character helped, indirectly, to kill the human race.So I've enjoyed it.The movie kind of retains some of those elements. There are many scenes missing, many scenes compressed and some scenes modified. I can understand that. However, while the bleak and dark atmosphere of the book is still there, it is not as hard hitting here. For example, without spoiling too much, in the book, the relationship between characters is of hate and distrust almost until the very end. Once the Sarge starts trusting the girl, she betrays him. Here, the Sarge starts acting like a friend way too fast. The scientist, in the book was a cold stone sociopath. A lot of the richness of the material was between the lack of any empathy and the fact that she was doing the right thing. The book wanted us to hate a good character not because of what they are but because of what they do. Here, it retains very little of that dualism.The ending is also different - both in how it happens and in the post scriptum. There is a love story that borders on rape that was ignored and the characters are far more politically correct.So I guess I didn't liked it. As a stand alone zombie movie, it is great. It is dark, bleak and there's no happy ending. There's no rescue coming. You know it is going to end bad, no matter what. You just hope that it will stay bad, not horrible. However, the beauty of ""The Girl With All The Gifts"" it was that it is a character driven story in a genre that doesn't usually do that. Zombie fiction is usually about a few key concepts and character development and morality is rarely among them. This movie, is just a well done zombie movie and without the strong character development, I'd rather watch Resident Evil."
" This is not a new take on the zombie genre. It's a bad adaptation of Star Trek's Miri episode
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,4,"The movie is well shot, has great visual effects and a lovely main character. But the overall experience was deeply annoying. Practically no background story, a bunch of plot holes, and a sudden and anti-climatic ending.This movie is marketed in many ways with a hint of drama. The title, the trailer and the first act of the movie all try to convey that. Not only this is not delivered, but the movie seems to mock you for believing that.The ending of this movie looks like an inside joke made to feature in the blue ray as an alternative ending."
" So what is this film really about?
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"So what is this film really about?Zombies? Nope Military? Nope What perfume to use to smell nice? NopeTeachers are always loving? NopeThe dilemma of saving the world paying one soul as price? Nooot quite. This film is fundamentally about the infinite capacity of children to be absolutely egocentric and narcissists. You don't get that, you don't get the closing (and that means you are simply... Old)Watch first (or afterwards) ""Let the right one in"" and get a second chance to grasp the idea... In the process you might get 20/30 years out of your oldie brain. And I am not joking when I say I cannot emphasize enough our responsibility as fathers (i am one of four.. I believe) to nurture our children in an ""streetsmart"" atmosphere of solidarity (not just being dumb..) hoping that, some day, when they grew old, they simply wont understand the end of these films.OK, now the big question... Would i sacrifice myself? Hummm, let me think... Im 47... Don't you mind asking me again in 30 years or so? Hehehe(apologies for my English if not good enough)"
" Fresh Take on the Genre - Beat for Beat Book Adaptation
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,9,"I read Mike Carey's ""The Girl with all the Gifts"" a year before this came out, and loved the fresh take on the Zombie genre, using the ophiocordyceps fungus as the power behind behind the pandemic. Look up this fungus and you'll see just why this is such a genius idea!The book was very moving - especially the way in which Sergeant Parks' starts out so hateful, yet grows into a character to love and empathise with. As usual with adaptations of books I have read (such as the Harry Potter, Jack Reacher and Hunger Games series) I was expecting at least a modicum of disappointment in either the casting or the screenplay. I was wrong.The film captures not only the heart of the Carey's book, but follows it beat for beat - almost as if the screenplay was written by the author himself. Oh... wait a minute... it was. If you are just looking for shocks and jumps, stick with more traditional zombie flicks, but if you looking for something fresh and engaging, that will stay with you long after the couple of hours viewing, this film will tick that box admirably. Enjoy!"
" Best film in it's genre in years. A must watch for horror fans!
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,10,"In short: The film has quality acting, direction, special effects, and script. That alone makes it unique in the horror genre. Spoiler ahead.... This is the best zombie film to come out for many years. The plot is original and the story line develops organically. It is a very well written film. The actors do a great job, which makes it worth watching just because that is often rare in a horror film. They also do great in conveying important points and ideas to the audience. The film has a budget, so the gore and special effects are done in a quality manner. This also makes this film worth watching. The director has done a great job in shooting this film."
" Something new in Zombie Horror genre, and a good too
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,7,"Colm McCarthy did a great job with this film. Its a refreshment in zombie genre, filled with dark atmosphere, lust, love, and animal instincts.Cast did good job in this film, Sennia Nanua, Gemma Arterton, Glenn Close were fantastic. I liked interaction between the characters, it's very good, the plot is was also good, with some fails. I also like how the disease was explained, but it could be more imaginative in a way. Nevertheless if you are horror and zombie fan, you are gonna like this movie, it's somewhat darker than classic horror movies, but i think true horror fan will appreciate it."
" A very short review of ""The Girl With All the Gifts"" (2016)
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"""The Girl With All the Gifts"" (2016) is a thoughtful, story-focused variation of the zombie horror genre, its basis on an acclaimed science fiction novel should be no surprise to anyone who sees it. It boasts a terrific action set piece, a great performance by Glenn Close, and some nice episodes of tension throughout.I might be a bit slow, but I must confess that I had a little bit of a hard time following which characters are the monsters, which are sometimes-monsters, and which characters are sometimes-monsters and also feral, as well as the some of the logic connected with how they can detect humans. The pacing was also a bit off Â… the first 20 minutes were quite slow, and I started to think that the entire story would take place within several interior locations. There is a major battle that should please horror fans, but it occurs quite early on. Somehow, the pacing for the entire film simply felt Â… off. Finally, this movie suffers somewhat from a slightly irritating musical score that sometimes felt like cheesy 1980's.This is still quite a serviceable entry into the genre, though. I'd give it an 8 out of 10, and I'd recommend it."
" This movie will make Z Wars look lame.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,9,"This might be a spoiler, not sure...This movie cost 4 million Euros; 6- 7 million us dollars. The US spends about two hundred million buck on mostly junk movies. First let me say; Glenn Close was a surprise, and she should be considered if this becomes a series, and it should? Seldom does it happen, this movie grabbed me right from the beginning, and would not let me go; it's still on my mind...this is why I am writing this. The Walking Dead got boring after the first three years or so...I still watch it waiting for everybody to die off, still waiting. Now back to this movie, The Girl... However, you have to think, and I am sure you'll have to watch it again as I will. Sennia Nanua, is a newcomer and (I think) will do great work in the future. Her caricature, Malanie was delightful and captured my heart. And I would have given the movie a 9-10, thou I believe only classics like Casablanca or Lost Horizons are entitled to the top row of movies. I could go on and on, however if you're not threatened by Zombie movies you will enjoy this special movie. Everyone was great that played in the movie deserves recognition for their part. See this movie somewhere, as I am sure it will go to video or Netflix's or some lame outlet...Enjoy."
" Terrific take on a so called zombie genre
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,9,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Girl with All the Gifts"" (2016) is hands down the most fresh, original and best zombie movie I've seen in many moons. This is a very intriguing movie to start with, the opening is terrific, middle until the end. The very ending of this movie was kinda... strange, it wasn't as good as the rest of the movie. Still ""The Girl"" delivers goods. Acting was good by all involved and especially by Sennia Nanua who played Melanie - she was terrific. I loved how this movie shows post apocalyptic world. And more then one time i though about ""The Last of Us"" when watching this movie, whey are very close in stories.Overall, ""The Girl with All the Gifts"" is s superb genre picture. For all who loves zombie movies, this is a gift and a must see."
" Love it! Love it! Love it!
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,10,"This excellently-made movie is in the tradition of 28 Days Later and its sequel. Unlike other ''survival'' movies or shows, there are no hero-figures - nothing syrupy. That is what makes this movie three-dimensional. Its about the antihero. The acting from the main characters are superb - especially Gemma Aterton and Sennia Nanua. The music - especially the eerie repetitive vocal chant - gives it an avant-garde post-apocalyptic feel. This movie makes you think at every turn. Even the ending - suspecting a Philip K. Dickian turn - had me go, ''Oh, no!'' It's a slow-paced movie without ever giving feeling that it was dragging. More please!"
" Not a zombie movie, but a hardcore and classic sci-fi!
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"Well, review scores for this movie is low (yes, low) because a lot of people sees only zombies in it. Yes, zombie part is done pretty well suspenseful and pretty realistic (but not without some assumptions and simplifications) but it is not a point of the movie! I will not tell the main question raised in it, but it is well known to avid reader of classic sci-fi, especially involving aliens ;) And it never hurts to think about it again!Anyway, it is an excellent, non trivial sci-fi movie raising very very important questions! I was very pleased to watch it and it will stay in my memory for a long time!"
" Day of the Planet of the Invasion of the Hungries
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"I found the opening to be rather tedious and was a bit concerned that it wasn't going anywhere. Given about twenty minutes or so, it finds its pace and takes off in a big way.A brief synopsis: it's an apocalyptic setting; a fungus is mutating the population into ""hungries"", who have the urge to bite and eat the remaining healthy population. A group of military personnel and scientists are working on a cure from studying a few captive anomalies who are dissected if required. I won't go on as it might start to venture beyond spoilerdome, but I'll sum up what I took away from it.You're probably thinking ""Day of the Dead"" rip-off, based on the above synopsis but that's really just how the movie is introduced. It does bear similarities with the latter movies of Romero's Dead trilogy, Invasion of the body Snatchers and 28 Days Later but at its core the theme closely resembles Planet of the Apes.So cook all these movies up in a pot and we get The Girl With All The Gifts. It's on a low budget but has managed to stretch it so well that it really has a vibe of a studio picture - just without all the bullshit and clichÃ©s. It's not without its flaws. Many set pieces are a bit formulaic and offer no heightened tension and, on more than one occasion, I found the child lead somewhat irritating. In fairness though, that's her character and not her performance. Paddy Considine is once again on form and is arguably the acting benchmark in an otherwise flat movie of performances, except perhaps for Glenn Close whose seasoned experience is obvious to the viewer.Don't expect a zombie gore fest. There's no sense of Fulci or Romero in it from that point of view but it does have one or two graphic scenes, which more or less drag what is a science fiction film partially into the horror genre.Surprisingly, I enjoyed the film to the end, despite the shaky start. I think it somehow manages to squeeze itself into an already overcrowded sub-genre and stand out to a degree."
" Bad character development and common sense
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,3,"The movie had some good parts; but over all poor character direction. for many characters to be military people they kept doing stupid things. The military training would never have them do such stupid actions. the scientist are suppose to be the smarter logical thinking people; but the act the most stupid. the writing has the characters not use any common sense. many character just start off with a personality with no history as to why they are that way, very confusing. they never really tell you why some characters are unique, they just are. the characters do things that would go against self survival for no reason. the ending has some cute points to it. all in all I did not like this movie it left me with a bad after thought of a waste of my time."
" A great British horror which redefines the genre
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,7,"Just when you think you're tired of zombies this film comes along and redefines the genre. Not only are these thinking zombies, but they also morph into plants. Sounds odd? Yes but once you're into the film you'll se it's just nature at work. Brilliantly conceived and nicely acted by all but with some gravitas from the always great Glenn Close. Sennia Nunua is a girl to watch too. The only casting blip is I'd say with the always not-that-good Paddy Considine. To be quite frank I'm not sure how he continues to get work because he's a very average actor and certainly not in the league of Gemma Arterton and not even on the same planet as Glenn Close. This is a great story with good pace, nicely directed and just enough horror to horrify you without actually going overboard."
" really not good
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,5,"**MASSIVE SPOILERS**The Girl (Sennia Nanua) is being held is a underground bunker-like thing, strapped to a wheelchair. They feed her maggots, because why wouldn't you. She's being taught school stuff, along with other kids, and we are supposed to think ermagherd, why are they treating the children so badly.Then they tell us straight up that the kids are in fact zombies.Ye, you see, a fungus or spore of sort has zombiefied everyone, except a small group of people. AND there are a minute number of kids who are born both zombie and person. So they hold them hostage (they become violent if released) in order to find a cure.There is a female teacher, who represents GOOD, and an army guy, who represents EVIL. The the zombies break in because plot, and due to circumstances which have nothing to do with the characterization of the main roles, the film demonstrates that GOOD is better than EVIL (even though by evil we mean ""find a cure, save humanity, and make sure zombies don't eat your brainz"").The Girl is not a horror or a scifi film, even though it used these as backdrop for its rather lame story. The main theme is that .. i don't know, mothers love their kids, bad people die, and hope is nice.The film was made with little money, and obviously by people who wanted really hard to do something meaningful, but sadly, does not manage to get there. Visually, i think even with more money they would have made a boring film, and with the main theme being ""it's good that people are good"" you're looking at what the BBC considers ""family drama"", just a step over a British soap opera.I would not recommend this film. it's totally uninspired, lacks ANY classical filmmaking talent, and the plot and theme are trite and boring. The characters .. omg, the characters are some of the blandest, most insignificant characters i have ever seen put on film. I've seen better in Battle Los Angeles. Save yourself and go watch something else Dystopian but with a message, maybe rent Equilibrium, or Dark City.My vote: a lame 5/10"
" A masterpiece....
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,1,".... of boredom.A rating of 7 means that brain dead zombies are now rating films at IMDb.The directors were real geniuses, they could make a zombie film that is slow moving, tedious, insipid and without scares. The little actress is pretty bland, Glenn Close was miscast and the pseudo-scientific explanation for the zombie epidemic is very unsatisfying.It was very hard to stay awake throughout the film. On one thing the directors succeeded, after a while watching this bore fest, one's brain function shuts down and we all start behaving like zombies."
" The Last of Us
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,7,"The opening scenes of The Girl with all the Gifts throw you if you know little about the film. Melanie (Sennia Nanua) is a young polite girl in a room that looks like a cell. In the morning she manacles herself into a wheel chair while armed soldiers push her to her classroom lessons along with other children in a similar state. Melanie remains unfailingly polite and we also realise she is clever.Are these children gifted? Part of some experiment? Why are the soldiers armed and remain vigilant?We soon find out when one soldier bursts in and rubs his arm with his spit. It looks like these children have cannibalistic tendencies, we already see Melanie given food which consisted of worms.The film is a take on the Zombie movie, society has collapsed because of a fungal infection of the brain turning people into zombies and it is evolving. These children were rescued from a hospital as babies and raised by the army. Dr Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close) is the scientist who sees Melanie and others to be experimented so she can find a cure for this fungus.Helen Justineau (Gemma Arterton) is the teacher who wants to protect Melanie from the soldiers and Dr Caldwell. She seems to have bonded with Melanie and even Melanie shows a protective attitude towards her even when she needs to feed.When the army base is in invaded by the zombies this three along with some soldiers escape and head for safety to another mobile unit. However it is clear society has broken down, the zombies are going through an evolution process and Dr Caldwell might be too late to develop a vaccine.This is probably the most striking British zombie film since 28 Days Later. It is a low budget film shot mainly in and around the Midlands. Director Colm McCarthy makes an interesting opening to this film and best use of the small budget for some special effects shots. He keeps the story human, the development of the relationship between Melanie and Justineau. Dr Caldwell supplies the scientific explanations but the story dos slow down in parts over halfway through.A wonderful central performance from Sennia Nanua who shows she is a talent to watch."
" Not better than the book, but better than I thought it would be
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,8,"I read the book...actually I listened to the audio book every day on the way to work. It was one of the best zombie stories, outside of World War Z that I had the pleasure to ""read"". Outside of a few deviations from the book: Melanie is blond and blue- eyed, Miss Justineau is black, Sergeant Parks' face is disfigured from a scar and some other minor departures, the movie was very enjoyable and suspenseful. The kind of zombie movie that makes you wonder how and if this could happen. Just imagine...? A fungus, a bacteria, that causes the masses to become zombies?? The Girl With All The Gifts. My friends and I had a great discussion debating what those gifts actually were."
" Complete Rip Off
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,1,"I know many of you reading this probably won't care, because of the praise this movie is getting, but this is one of the most blatant rip offs I have seen in recent memory.Let me recap: The story involves a post apocalyptic setting where a strain of Cordyceps fungus has mutated. Infecting most of the population, turning them into violent mutated zombie like humans who attack and eat anyone and anything. The fungus is transmitted through bites, but the longer humans are infected they can begin to spread the disease by becoming immobile and beginning sprouting pods that shoot spores into the air, spreading the fungi even more. But years after the infection begins we find a girl. A special girl who is immune to the effects of the fungus. A group searching for a cure learns of the girl and wants to bring her to a center/base to use her to create the cure. She has a protector that starts off looking after her as just a job, but begins to care for her. But then her protector learns that creating the cure with the help of this special girl involves killing her. Now they have to decide if they can live with sacrificing her to save the world. And now you have the full plot of The Last of Us. A critically acclaimed and award winning video game that came out in the summer of 2013. A full YEAR before the book was even published. Could this be a coincidence? Sure. Maybe. But come on...This gets a 1 star for being a complete rip off and doing it worse than the video game. If it wasn't a rip off it would be an OK movie at best."
" Good production, weak story
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"A mysterious girl held captive at a military base in a class of children makes a connection with her teacher, just as a zombie plague threatens to overwhelm the defences.Overly earnest zombie adventure that addresses the big question of the nature of life. The intro is interesting, providing some mystery, and the action is pretty good in what is a big production by British standards. The zombies vary from full sprint attack to swaying torpor, and the detail is very good in closeup.Problem is with the writing, which doesn't provide a compelling concept and delivers uninspired dialogue, stodgy exposition, and awkward sequences where characters pop up from nowhere. How does the teacher end up in the lab, and why is she holding a fire extinguisher? How does the doctor escape the lab? How does the sergeant find the girl in the end? Several questions like these interrupt the viewing, and clearly the script needed more development. Also it's no surprise to find the writer used to be a teacher, as there's a didactic feel to various scenes and to the overall tone and a lack of real drama.Performances are good. The little girl has screen presence, although the inflection of her voice needs more variety. Paddy Considine looks a little aged. Big mistake to have Arterton spend the whole performance in fatigues and a cable knit sweater. Best performance is by Glenn Close.The photography is good, with a muddy green tint, and the sound - especially the creepy score. The pace does drag, but I think that's down to the story rather than the editing.Overall: plenty of quality, but the production can't get over a misconceived story."

" The Girl Who Played With Gifts.
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,10,"With a poll taking place on IMDb's Classic Film board for the best titles of 2016,I decided that I would use the poll to re- watch the 3 Horror creations from auteur Mike Flanagan. Gathering up Flanagan's trio,a family friend told me about an unsettling (non- Flanagan) British Horror that he had recently tracked down,which led to me unwrapping this gift.The plot:Infected with a zombie virus before being born, Melanie is one of a unique group of zombies,who have cravings for flesh,but are also able to continue thinking and feeling. Held on an army base,Melanie and other zombie kids are taught by Helen Justineau,as Dr. Caroline Caldwell experiments on them to find a cure. Caught in the middle of a zombie invasion on the army base,Melanie,Caldwell,Justineau and soldiers Sgt. Parks and Privates Kieran Gallagher and Dillon. As they search for a new location,the humans discover that Melanie is the girl with all the zombie gifts.View on the film:Presenting a gift to the viewer in her debut role, Sennia Nanua gives an incredible, heart-felt performance as Melanie. Keeping Melanie's humanity in her eyes as a desire for flesh dislocates her jaw, Nanua snaps at the horror with a nail-biting frustration to gain a grip on the hunger. Looking up to Justineau as a parent,Nanua gives the loose mother/daughter relationship a refreshing feeling of spontaneity,which is sharply contrasted by Nanua giving Melanie a dour outlook on her existence and the crumbling society that humans (barely) still control. Standing up to those who want to kill Melanie,sexy Gemma Arterton gives an expressive performance as Justineau.Looking out to the dead world with rough edges of hate,Arterton's wonderfully sands them down with a subtle change in body language carrying the love Justineau has for her ""daughter"" which leads to Justineau brushing aside the signs of danger.Butting heads with everyone, Paddy Considine gives a tough as nails performance as Parks. Hitting out in rage at the mere sight of zombies,Considine (who is to reunite with his great,gentle co-star Anthony Welsh in The Death of Stalin) finely handles Parks partially letting his guard down to Melanie,with a fear just under the eyes that the humans are losing the battle. Screeching out at those who block the experiments, Glenn Close gives an explosive performance as Caldwell,whose rage to find a cure Close makes more vicious then some of the zombie attacks!Giving a sound to the embers of a dying world, Cristobal Tapia de Veer enchants the surroundings with an evocative, Industrial score,nailed with tumbling drums to the deadly silence before an attack,and Trip- Hop earthy vocals casting a shadow of impending doom that no one is able to escape. Biting on his own novel,the screenplay by Mike Carey retains novel roots to drawing complex, conflicting emotions in the characters,with a sharp, musk outlook for isolated locations that benefit from the visual anxiety. Examining the outbreak from Melanie's zombie eyes, Carey brilliantly makes Drama the dominating genre,as the gradual bond between Melanie and Justineau makes the horror hit with an unrelenting punch, where Justineau finds herself the one getting taught. Trapping the group with no option but to stealthy follow the footsteps of the walking dead,director Colm McCarthy & cinematographer Simon Dennis (who both filmed season 2 of Peaky Blinders) offer unsettling glimpse of a hyper-reality,where extreme, stilted close-ups of the zombies are glazed in saturated colours. Chomping on the horror in limited bloodshot,McCarthy makes the outbursts ones which get under the skin of the group,that circle round in highly stylish confined shots digging the group with merciless terror. Ending on a haunting Sci-Fi note,McCarthy expertly threads drops of CGI with chilling practical locations from the real outskirts of British city centres, dripping with light green shades of nature releasing a new, dominant species,as Melanie reveals her gifts."
" 7 out 10 - Really?
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,3,"This is not a 7 out of 10 movie - don't be misled. It starts out fairly well in the first 10 minutes, but goes downhill as soon as the compound is breached by the 'Hungries' - calling them by a different name doesn't detract the fact that this is a typical zombie movie. The 'heroes' all manage to escape the compound and tread the formulaic routine of crossing the country moving through hordes of zombies without ever really being in danger. There was the typical scene where the expendable soldier decides to take his gun belt off to enter some store and as expected gets eaten. I didn't get any feeling of tension from any part of the film. I didn't care about any of the characters and I was really, really hoping that Gemma Arterton was going to be eaten. I was wishing for the end a good 40 minutes to go, but I'm glad I made it to see the ending - even I didn't see that coming - unbelievable - in a crap way! I give it 3 stars for the young girl debut."
" The Last of Us movie we never got
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"Although from the best selling novel (which I've not read) TGWATG most certainly could almost take place parallel to the The Last of Us (award winning video game with a movie in the works from Sony and Sam Raimi). The very tone, imagery and premise are incredibly similar so one for fans of that game. For those not familiar with that this simply put a well made Brit flick eschewing the usual Hollywood clichÃ©s. The cast are spot on and the script is certainly not predictable, a very mysterious opening that pans out well to the end. Good source material, direction and a great cast have made this movie a very decent flick for the price of one episode of Game of Thrones. Thought provoking, tense and simply creepy at times ticks a lot of boxes for Sci-Fi horror fans."
" This movie has all the gifts
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,9,"At first, when I found out this was going to be yet another zombie movie, I almost lost interest. However, after watching the first 3 minutes I was intrigued. I thought to myself, ""wait a minute, this doesn't look like the same old, same old"" and it certainly wasn't. This film is the thinking person's zombie flick. It follows none of the normal conventions of the genre excepting of course for the idea of an infected populace of zombies, referred to in this incarnation as ""hungries."" That's where all similarities to every other movie in the genre ends. One is forced to consider complex concepts while viewing this powerhouse. For example, early on in the film, the scientist, played by Glenn Close, who is trying to synthesize a vaccine for the fungal infection that created the hungries, posits that the hungries aren't really living thinking humans suffering from a disease. Her theory is that they are merely hosts for the disease, which she believes is what is ultimately in charge of the body. As such, she doesn't believe that they are thinking, feeling sentient humans. Later on in the film, after her experiences with the main protagonist in the film, a second generation infected child named Melanie, she reverses her opinion. This reversal of opinion sparks Melanie to ask, ""Well if we are alive, why should we sacrifice ourselves for YOUR survival?"" This film has the usual excitement one expects from an action movie, yet for those like myself, who despise action for action's own sake with no intelligent plot, it offers much more. If you are sick and tired of the same old thing, this is for you. It isn't your father's zombie flick. This film left me ""hungry"" for more."
" in my top 5 favorite zombie movies...
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"...not just a great zombie movie but a very very good movie in general. great cast of glenn close, paddy considine, gemma arterton and the girl was awesome too. the movie costed 4 million pounds and had 3 leads who all could easily command 4 mil lbs each per film so it was probably a labor of love. great story..kept me engrossed for its nearly 2 hrs. running time. so so original and unlike just about all zombie films this particular one will move a lot of people to tears. ..too bad its all over with already and there wasn't much promo done for this movie. all the actors and actresses were on top of their A game...the girl was a wonder...mesmerizing film....not to be missed."
" Nothing new, just another zombie movie we already seen tons of
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,4,"There was a time when everyone would get excited over any new zombie movie or video game being released. That craze is done now, and the only zombie related thing people are actually my invested in now is The Walking Dead and The Last Of Us 2.The Girl With All The Gifts is no different, and is just a very dull average predictable zombie film that we all seen before. Perhaps if this was released 7 years ago it would be cool, but now it's just the same. Zombie outbreak, group of survivors , slowly they get infected, the end.This tried to stand out from the rest, by having one of the main protagonist Melanie, a child, who is a zombie but yet can still function fully as a human. This concept on paper sounds like it might have been cool, but this movie fails to even take advantage of that. It could have been an awesome and fresh take if the movie were to take advantage of that, but instead all it did was have a very cringe scene towards the end (don't want to spoil but it was really portrayed badly). Oh well.So that said, this movie gets a 4/10 only cause the acting by Melania was pretty good for a kid. Low budget repetitive zombie film, with an awful ending with very little action in this movie make this just a boring experience."
" Average, could have been better.
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,5,"Really liked the concept behind this film, intriguing throughout but never really delivers. The base story is pretty good but the delivery feels a little amateur and it needed to go a little darker into the sub plots and characters. Maybe could of built a little more before moving out of the first scenes, a little rushed to get into the action. I liked how the film moves into the story without giving anything away, you are guessing from the start. It's a shame that a lot of the film seems to spell things out too easily, a little more guesswork would leave the audience gripped. Worth a watch if you keep expectations on a level. Saturday night potential but it's a Sunday afternoon hangover film in the end."
" Untrue to the book in all the wrong ways.
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,5,"Contains Spoilers Ill start this by saying that I read the book a few times and I think some things were changed in the movie which made it worse.Dr. Caldwell was much more hated in the book. In the movie she is actually quite nice to Melanie and fairly reasonable person, which makes Mrs. Justineau's hatred for her somewhat unreasonable.In the book Melaine kills two unknown ""junkers"" to protect Mrs. Justineau but in the movie she kills two good soilders.Mainly the balance is all wrong. I cant care for any of the characters in the movie.Melaine is even responsible for using a cute dog as bait for the zombies, in the book its a wild fox.Not sure why this currently has a 7/10. Deserves a 5."
" Well worth a watch if you're a fan of the genre.
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Lord Of The Flies meets 28 Days Later in this unique contribution to the zombie-horror genre.It's a fascinating premise in that it focuses on the children affected by the root cause of the zombie epidemic which combines effortlessly with the idea of the 'thinking zombie' and what would happen if they had the ability to learn.Despite an uneven flow and inconsistent pace, and a sense of misplaced humour at times, there is much to praise here. The utilisation of a hauntingly brilliant score was perfect, and there is plenty of tension and suspense to keep things interesting. There are also some fine performances from a cast who embraced their characters with gusto.It's undoubtedly Sennia Nanua as Melanie, personifying the unique idea of this story against its numerous genre predecessors, who really helps this stand out amongst them.By no means perfect, certainly not scary and definitely disjointed, but this is something different, enjoyable, interesting, and at times utterly enthralling. Well worth a watch if you're a fan of the genre.For the full review, and further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/"
" Zombies meets Vampires....sort of
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"A solid zombie film. The Girl With All The Gifts is a well put together journey to a post apocalyptic world infested with zombies. The twist is there are zombie children that can behave normally. They do need to feed, akin to vampires. Their blood thirst cannot be stopped. There are some interesting variations to the zombie theme in this movie. The fact that they use their sense of smell to detect life was particularly fascinating. The hungries, as they are called are fast moving zombies that mutate quickly when infected. The ending is a little disappointing and leaves questions in the open. Overall a good zombie movie and one worth watching."
" I loved it! Almost as good as ""World War Z.""
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"Definitely worth your time. Just goes to prove you can make a darn good movie out of a Zombie story, just like you can out of any other story. Just spend the money, get a good director, good writers, and hire skilled actors.""Girl"" kept me right on the edge of my seat, and it made me think about what was happening and why. I also loved the sets, especially when they got to the city, and I really got into the story.The big surprise for me was the cast. They were all Pros, especially the young woman who starred in this. She nailed her part.If you enjoy good Zombie movies, or just unusual stories, you'll love this."
" Just another poor zombie movie
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,"The movie has the feel of a cheap 1970s TV production,where the cast and there's about 5 main characters plus various Zombie extras are in a shelter, outside the are the zombies.The main character the little girl is the focus of the film.The movie starts of feeling cheap and tacky and continues this theme throughout,the actors are OK i suppose but i wanted to turn this movie off within the first 20 minutes i persevered and watched to the end mainly because there was nothing on TV to watch at the time i was watching this movie.The plot is pretty limited and indeed pretty underwhelming.All in all if you have nothing to do,your satellite TV is down and the only thing available is this movie then you would still be better looking at your living room wall.nothing to recommend this im afraid.All in all Poor."
" Save your time and money, don't watch this.
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,1,"As a person that like all things zombie I feel that I can accept much. Nomatter budget or story, most zombie films have something to offer. This one however is quite frankly one of the worst things I've come across. I can handle bad acting, sans Glenn Close that is the only person in the film worth paying attention to. But the rest, I've never been so happy about a gag on child actors, just to not have to put up with their horrible non talent. Usually violence is used when you don't have narrative, and in this film it is very obvious, as random attacks on animals is what used to tug at your interest when enough violence against humans have been used. It is a zombie film after all. Or is it? Fungi infected people are more like retarded junkies on a 24/7 psycho-trip than any type of zombie. The reason this was launched as some sort of zombie film is to cash in on the zombie craze. (Just like vampires was all the rage a few years ago) And for the first time I feel that enough is enough, as someone that loves zombies I have come to the end of my rope, and I just want to hang the creators of the film in it.Goodbye zombies, please rest in peace from now on. And save us from pieces of crap that this film is.Save your time and your money, do not watch this film."
" More Zombies
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"The star of this film is Sennia Nanua, a little girl who plays Melanie, a precocious kid with a disease which has turned her and others into your typical flesh eating zombies. She is the subject of government experiments led by a doctor, played by the only American in the cast, Glenn Close. The Doctor needs Melanie to create a vaccine to stop the plague from destroying the human race. Blood is spilled with great frequency, but the acting and script keep The Girl With All The Gifts moving along and keep it one of the better living dead movies in a while. The British accents are a bit thick, and the background music is overwhelming at times, but these shortcomings are not that major. The ending is not what I expected and I can recommend this due to the great performance by Ms. Nanua."
" Two over saturated ideas bled together in a poop milkshake
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,1,"Awful. just awful. I really have been a huge fan of all things zombie but it's gone to far. Just the idea of slapping a ""zombie"" sticker or your project seem to be enough to get it approved, no matter how bad it is. And it is bad. A few of the actors are good, but most of it i just bad. Annoying zombie Children ripping up animals to make a Movie ""gritty and real"", Real? It's a zombie film. I can't get worse than that. The whole post-apocalyptic scene is almost over saturated, and the zombie scene has been for a while. Combine the two and you get a massive piece of crap that is just un-watchable. Save your time and Watch some original work, like Romeros ""Dead"" trilogy. This thing is not worth your time."
" Finally!
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Finally a good zombie movie! Been waiting long for one! Do someone have another good zombie movie to recommend?Interesting source and development of the zombie virus. And a thoughtful ending, I might say. I wonder what kind of a future the infected would create? Would there be a future for the uninfected? I doubt that it would make a great sequel, though. And the visual effects is as believable as possible, The Walking Dead has set up an high standard, in my opinion! Gemma Arterton gives a strong performance, as always. The performance of Sennia Nanua is hard to review, because I believe that the character Melanie isn't able to convey much feelings at all at that stage of being. She feels something for Justineau, but it's not showing in her face - just in her actions. Kind of. But for someone at that age and with so little experience I would say that Sennia Nanua is doing good! Recommend it!"
" Interesting & different, I really enjoyed it!
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,9,"I've been looking forward to watching this movie and it didn't disappoint! I am a big horror/thriller/drama fan, and I do love zombie movies, and this was a completely new variation that focused more on the human story, which I also love, but the story behind it all is unlike other films I've seen. I'd say this is more of a drama with thriller/horror aspects mainly due to the situation the characters are in, and I'd encourage everyone to give it a watch! The acting is great, the story is unique and interesting and It was not predictable at all. I haven't read the book but I'm going to do so next. I really enjoyed this movie!"
" A gift for zombie fans.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"The Girl With All The Gifts is yet another entry in the ever popular yet often uninspired infected/zombie genre, but it's one that actually manages to be refreshingly original, refusing to follow many of the rules established since Romero brought us Night of the Living Dead.The film opens in an underground military facility where a group of children are being detained, locked in cells during the night, and strapped into wheelchairs to be educated during the day by teacher Helen Justineau (Gemma Arterton). But these are no ordinary kids: they are infected with a pathogen that causes them to crave human flesh; despite this fact, however, they are still capable of rational thought, with Melanie (Sennia Nanua) being a particularly bright student.Dr. Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close) believes that the children can be used to create an anti-virus for the disease that has ravaged mankind, but before she gets a chance to prove her theories, the base is over-run by 'hungries' (as the infected are known). Justineau, Caldwell, and Melanie narrowly escape the ravenous hordes, joining forces with Sgt. Eddie Parks (Paddy Considine) and his men on a hazardous journey to safety.With its cognisant second-generation zombie kids, born of infected mothers, this film quickly distances itself from the countless zombie films out there, but the film also has several other cool ideas that mark it as different: the humans can make themselves invisible to the hungries through the use of a special gel that disguises their scent; the pathogen mutates, turning the zombies into huge plant-like structures bearing seed pods that, if opened, will make the virus airborne; the humans are attacked by feral second-generation children who can use weapons and lay traps.Best of all, the ending of the film questions humanity's right to survival, and whether, when the time comes, we should accept our fate and allow a new race to take our place. It's a thought provoking way to wrap up a neat little film."
" Ranges Frome Well Done to Bad
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"The Girl with All the Gifts is a good movie of the walker/infected genre - a fungus spreads out in the world and transforms the humans to flesh craving numb-heads. We follow some scientists, a girl who has maybe the potential to cure the world and some soldiers in a world out of control. Well done are some scenes and settings which depict the feel of a desolated world very good, also we get some iconic scenes with the transforming crazies. What else!? Gemma Arterton and Glen Close can't act bad. But I have to say the last quarter of the movie including the solution was a little bit too much of a let down to me. For example the scene where the little girl defends Gemma and a soldier against a horde of hungry crazy kids is so out of place and bad executed I couldn't help myself and felt embarrassed for the cast, for the director, for my self - this scene (I guess you will understand me if you watch/watched the movie) is laughable, a total mess and it shows harsh the other weak point of the movie - the abilities of the girl actor are too restricted and if she got for a longer time into the focus of the play/camera it shows hard (as the girl grunted against the other kids I didn't know if I should laugh or cry out for mercy - it is even more bad as some of that kiddo stuff in Mad Max III). So The Girl with All the Gifts is a good movie regarding the first three quarters, after that the movie loses its quality - rapidly. So 28 Days Later is still the supreme master of the fast-running-whatever-flesh-craving-maniacs-genre. This one is a nice try, but not more. First 3 quarters get a 7-8 from me, the last quarter only 3 makes 6 in my own math."
" Nothing predictable about this, nothing whatsoever..
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"As a prolific reviewer, you tend to often discuss a film in terms of traditional arcs, and riffs off those same arcs.Which is why it is always a treat when a film comes along that throws the script template out the window and forges its own path.This is such a film. It reminded me of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN 1957, the first legitimate A-list sci-fi that, like this film, started off in what seemed a traditional manner -- and then went down a plot superhiway that no one had ever seen before.It is not a perfect film. It has some flaws. For example, the first 30 minutes are better (more impact, more empathy, more entertaining) than the last 60 minutes. Which is not to suggest that the last hour is bad, merely that the first half-hour is drop-dead stunning and unforgettable.And the director often seems confused about who the real star is? Ditto for the PR dept of the studio. If you check the IMDb reference, you will see that the young girl so brilliantly played by Sennia Nanua is given billing lower down on the cast list. That's an error. Sennia IS the film -- she practically picks it up and carries it to the finish line. The scenes without her are weak, the scenes with her are wonderful.Nice iteration of a ""really smart"" zombie film. Recommended."
" Nice little movie
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"I will start saying I did not read the book. That said, ""The girl with all the gifts"" is the kind of movie I like: low-bo. I like the fact that it concentrates more on the living than on the non-living. They accept they know little about the zombies, except that human race is in danger and they are thriving to survive: just like every species. The strongest flaw I find in the movie is that they do not let us know the main character very well. The script just give us this little prisoner who is extremely intelligent and kind to everybody, but does not deepen on why she is the way she is (which does not make much sense) and the end result is a main character that is not strong enough and feels a little flat. Feels like the point of the movie is living you with more questions than answers (kind of: go and by the book, you bitch), but apart from that I liked it, specially the beginning, that immediately captures your attention, and the end, that is an ode to evolution and survival. Nice little movie. I find the biggest issue here is the script."
" Another addition to Zombie media with the only real noteworthy difference being a little Black girl as our lead.
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"Trigger Warning(s):Maggots | Headshots | Baby CarcasNoted Actor(s)Dr. Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close) | Helen Justineau (Gemma Arterton) | Melanie (Sennia Nanua)Characters & StorylineIn some sort of post-Zombie apocalypse world Dr. Caroline Caldwell still tries to find a vaccine in order to save the pockets of humanity that is left, and one of the people in her way is a teacher. One Ms. Helen Justineau who is trying to protect this little girl named Melanie. A sweet girl, the kind you'd want for your daughter but, thing is, she is like those they fear. She is a ""Hungry,"" this movie's term for zombies, and while still in control, very human appearing, when she is hungry she becomes like the rest. However, with such a developed mind there is the question of whether she may possess the vaccine, could her death mean salvation for the rest? That is part of the struggle in the film, that and surviving.HighlightsSennia NanuaChild actors are a dime a dozen. Often times they are just cute kids who thankfully remember their lines and cues. However, there are also those who have something beyond a cuteness factor, an innocence which is used for sympathy or to lull you into a false sense of security. Nanua has that. Like some young stateside actors such as Jacob Tremblay known for Room or Oona Laurence known for Southpaw, you see in Nanua this potential. This ability that very few young actors have to not only hang with their more seasoned peers but legitimately command the audience's attention.CriticismSo Many Missed OpportunitiesPerhaps the biggest issue of this movie is it fails to harness the idea of our heroes fearing for their lives much less them having bonds with each other, much less Melanie having a bond with Ms. Helen. To elaborate, Melanie obviously cares for her peers for while they aren't allowed to interact, can't see much besides the back of another person's head, unless they are within their peripheral vision, when she learns one has died it saddens her. With this, you'd think a darkness would start to grow as the truth of her living situation was revealed. Then from there, the movie's world is one filled with zombies. For reasons unknown, said zombies overrun the base and force our heroes into the outside world. There, as much as some are trigger happy, you don't get this real sense of fear or even tension. It's like everyone was working against CGI, rather than real people, so they just couldn't get into it.But perhaps my biggest issue is that Melanie and Ms. Helen, despite how much they seem to like each other, don't form a real close bond. I'm talking about mother/ daughter or big sister/ little sister. Something to make it so when Helen is amongst the zombies, you fear for her life because of how it may affect Melanie. Something to make it so in those moments when there aren't zombies around, and there isn't a strong possibility of someone being killed, you'd have reason to focus and care about what is going on. For, I mean, even if Ms. Helen kept it in a favorite student and favorite teacher level and just continued Melanie's lessons, maybe did more stories since now she could, that would have been better than what was given to us.But, in general, it just feels like everyone is kept at arm's length, as detached from you as they are some sense of personality, and only Nanua gives you any reason to connect with her character.Overall: Mixed (Home Viewing)While Nanua definitely seems like a star in the making, unfortunately, this film doesn't do her potential justice. It ignores the path of building the relationship between her character and Arterton's or even making the lives of Melanie's peers matter to her deeply, it somehow lacks the tension of 100s of zombies who could kill them all any minute, and just as everyone keeps Melanie at arm's length, they do the same to you. Leaving it where you don't really get to know any character, you can't form a bond with anyone besides Melanie, and honestly, you do that mostly because Nanua seems like a sweetheart and brings that to the character.Hence the Mixed label for this, overall, just seems like a lazy zombie film which isn't trying to do anything interesting or new to the genre. Much less, while you can see all this potential, especially considering who is involved, it seems to rush its way to its ending. Which considering this movie is nearly two hours, believe me when I say how strange it felt watching this and waiting for them to finally grab you, only to realize the movie was over."
" It's OK, I guess.
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,5,"I don't really know what to write other than this is another zombie flesh eaters flick that's only mediocre. I don't get the other reviews that say it's so ""brilliant"".I, myself, think it's slow moving and boring. There are no good special effects and it just seems low budget. It's not a bad movie, just not a very good one IMO. We have our own tastes so YMMV.Also, the person who said this is the best movie since 28 days later... Makes me wonder what movie they were watching. This has nothing on that movie.I gave this a 5/10. If you're bored and want to kill some time watching a movie of this genera, then by all means go for it. It's worth a watch, but IMO it's nothing special at all."
" This Grim And Gritty Gift Of A Movie Doesn't Disappoint
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"One film I was looking forward to in 2016 was THE PURGE ELECTION NIGHT but that ended up as a predictable disappointment . There was nothing else cinema wise that was on the horizon until I caught Mark Kermode's movie review on the BBC where he raved about a low budget British horror movie THE GIRL WITH ALL THE GIFTS . Catching a couple of short clips I was instantly intrigued and thought to myself how similar it was to Danny Boyle's 28 DAYS LATER . Despite Kermode's praise it's a film that seemed to disappear very quickly with little acclaim . Despite this I made a point of catching it first opportunity I got so what better way to celebrate the start of 2017 by watching the film that wins my award of the best film of 2016 Yes you read that right a low budget British zombie apocalypse movie is my favourite movie of 2016 . I know I didn't see too many films last year but even so this doesn't negate TGWATG in any way shape or form . It's only a zombie film on the surface and scratch away the wafer thin surface and you've something totally compelling and multi-layered Okay let's get the very few negatives out of the way first . First thing is the central character Melanie is just far too knowing to be entirely convincing as a child , but I guess that's narrative convention . Secondly the first 15 minutes of the film builds up a lot of mystery as to who Melanie and the other children might be , but this mystery becomes totally redundant if you know what type of sub-genre you're watching . Thirdly the army unit is more cosmopolitan than the united colours of Benneton . For some reason every TV show and film has the British army being more racially diverse than Daesh/ISIS Positives ? I'd just tell you watch the movie but that'd be too easy . If you're expecting a relatively straight forward take on 28 DAYS LATER you'll be very surprised because nearly everything here surpasses Boyle's film especially the story details . The quasi zombies nicknamed ""Hungries"" have suffered their condition due to a fungal infection and the fungus adds another obstacle for the human survivors to worry about. Some scenes are genuinely disturbing but the most chilling scene involves Dr Caroline Caldwell describe an incident in a maternity ward . Let's just say if you know anyone who is pregnant don't let them see this movie . Yeah it's only a movie but it's so intense and convincing that I'm glad I'll never get pregnant . In fact I'm glad of there being little chance of me getting anyone pregnant With a budget of Â£4.000.000 director Colm McCarthy works miracles and the two best aspects are using an amorphous soundtrack by Cristobal Tapia de Veer which is oppressive and atmospheric in equal measure and McCarthy - ""British foreign legion"" aside - casts well . Gemma Arterton proves she's more than a pretty face , Close and Considene are better than usual and the real revelation is Sennia Nanua as Melanie who makes her feature film debut and this will certainly not be the last we'll be hearing from her I don't want to over hype TGWATG but I was looking forward to seeing it and all expectations were surpassed by a very long margin . I should guard my back somewhat by stating once again by stating this is a grim . gritty but great apocalyptic thriller . I like these type of stories but even so I'm going to have trouble sleeping for a long time . It's undoubtedly the best horror film I've seen since THE MIST from ten years ago and just simply the best and most powerful movie I've seen in a long time"
" This is an homage to Octavia E. Butler
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness."" Oscar Wilde While I celebrate Colm McCarthy's film and recommend everyone see it, I write this to make sure everyone recognizes the source material. This is a movie I've sort of been waiting for a long, long time. BIG Spoilers, so be warned. Just when you thought no one could do anything new regarding the Zombie Apocalypse (side note, is the popularity of Zombie stories an acknowledgement that most of us have been educated in the west, to despise our fellows?) here we have a story in which Zombie children go to school. Sennia Nanua, in an Oscar worthy performance, is the best kid in class. Always chipper, polite and even remembering everyone's' name. As the movie progressed, I got a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu and then it hit me. This story is an imitation of an Octavia E. Butler type story. Reminded me in particular, of Fledgling. You have a new species of humans and one of them tries to bridge the gap between the new and the old. Nearly every one of Ms. Butler's stories dealt with similar themes. I loved the story. As Colm is a guy, he did diverge from one of Ms. Butler's other common themes â€“ we can survive sometimes, besides the ""other species."" What I mean is, at the end of the film, it is clear the teacher is one of the last remaining humans, but her future looks dire. Ms. Butler would have ended this on a more uplifting note."
