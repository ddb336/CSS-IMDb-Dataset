" Great comedy!
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,9,"A couple of days ago, I watched movie Ride Along on Netflix. It is comedy, with films stars Kevin Hart and Ice Cube. It is a story about guy Ben which is trying to prove his girlfriendÂ´s brother- James, that he is good for her. James is police detective. Ben was in police academy, because he wanted to be also cop. James took him on day, to prove him that he shouldnÂ´t be a cop. James on purpose take only bad cases that day. In the end they find the way to be friends and help eachother when they needed to. The character of James is overprotective brother and trying looking mad but he is nice guy. The character of Ben is also nice guy, which will do anything to prove that he should be cop and also be great guy for his girlfriend. In my opinion, this is predictable, funny comedy. The best thing abou the film is the acting and special effects. Overall, it is really great comedy."
" Easy going action flick
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,6,"Kevin Hart and Ice Cube carry this film. Nothing too out of the ordinary and quite predictable, I had a feeling some cops would end up being dirty and Kevin's character would come to the rescue. Overall though an easy and kind of fun action flick to follow."
" The movie and my view
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,5,In my opinion I didn't like the acting of actors so much except Kevin. The acting was very simple and didn't show the reality of the story. I didn't know if I watch comedy or action movie. I liked the decoration in movie. The choice of colors was successful from the director. It drew my attention really. The scene of Kevine that was speaking as Omar to his gangster I think It was absurd because it proccessed by senarist simply. It think It would have been better
" Must watch for fun
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,9,Great experience....just watch it. I was able to find a good movie that just relaxed me after long shitty day ðŸ™ƒ
" ride along to the dump
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,1,Each to their own but I just can't understand how anyone finds hart even remotely funny or watchable.Everything he's been in is painfully unbearable & basically the same regurgitation.
" WITTY - SHARP - FUNNY - WELL WORTH WATCHING.
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,9,I don't get some reviews its as if they don't want to just relax and enjoy a witty comedy cop farce. The script is sharp and funny. Great acting. Of course the story-line is far fetched but thats the point. I enjoyed every minute of this film.
" Cheap action movie ,not comedy but annoying
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,5,The movie is not funny just one secne or 2 maximum was funny..kevin hart is very annoying in this movie and and he keep say silly stuff and screaming whole the movie .the story was cheap and acting from kevin hart was very annoying
" Good fun
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,7,Good fun film with some good action and a decent story which was pretty original. The partnership between Ice cube and Kevin hart was also great.
" Fun...
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,8,"Sometimes being short-tempered and superb can be dangerous, excess self-esteem never works, but the movie is fun, the exaggeration bothers me, but the jokes are satisfying ..."
" Could not stop Laughing
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,9,"What a great movie! It has it all, drama, action and of course laughter. A lot of laughter. A thrill to watch!I, Jannes Hache, recommend this movie!"
" Better than ""Fist Fight"".
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,7,"A fairly lightweight but enjoyable ""old-themed"" story was well played by all, and all things considered was an effortless film to enjoy.
I found it far more entertaining than ""Fist Fight"" - a comparative ""one-trick"" pony."
" Quite solid
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,7,Ice Cube is great but the little black guy is annoying af
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,7,Very funny with a decent story and action. entertaining overall (2 viewings)
" Ride Along Review
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,8,"Ben Barber (Hart), a high-energy security guard, tags along with his prospective brother-in-law James Payton (Ice Cube) for a 24-hour patrol around Atlanta. Hoping to prove himself worthy of Payton's sister (Sumpter), he over-reaches when crime comes to call...
Pairing Ice Cube's gruff persona with Kevin Hart's motor mouth must have seemed like a great idea on paper. Yet while the film has been a big hit in the States, box-office success is not always an indicator of a memorable or classic comedy, and the mismatched-buddy-cop antics on display here rarely rise above the chuckle level despite the charisma factor. Even that isn't enough to carry a film that slogs through a script structure so musty you wonder if it wasn't discovered in an Egyptian tomb. Kevin Hart is a star in the making, but this particular vehicle needed better wheels.
The Pesci-in-Lethal-Weapon premise is spun out into a feature-length jamboree of minor laughs and clunkiness."
" Cultural differences are so great
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,5,"Cultural differences are so great that many dialogues do not understand. In terms of the overall plot, it relies entirely on dialogue, no funny scenes, no hot action."
" A suprise
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,7,I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Kevin Hart is a funny guy and his chemistry with ice cube was really good. An all round funny film
" Ride along (2014)
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,4,"Besides Kevin Hart's comedic appearance the story lacks fun and even action. Ice Cube was fun in ""21 Jumb Street (2012)"" but not in this.So Don't waste your time in this.Overall - 2/5"
" Lazy writing with mildly amusing cliches
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,4,There are some good actors in this film. But it was all following such a lazy storyline. Painfully bad. At some points they must have got so bored because they couldn't even be bothered to try and make it believable. The climax in the warehouse was an appalling example of direction. It dragged on and stalled half way through. Then they realised so just added a very poor shootout scene. It was just so lazy.It had its mildly amusing bits but that's it. I can't recommend it.
" a sub-par attempt at a buddy cop movie
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,2,Review: I was torn because the concept of this movie is really good but the execution was horrendous. The direction wasn't bad. The screenplay are story are both in credible. The casting and acting are both sub-par. All in all I would give this two out of a possible five stars.
" Tepid ""comedy"" with little-to-no redeeming features
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,3,"I feel the need to watch a lot of comedies these days as my mood is often grumpier and more irritable than Ice Cube (in general, not just every character he plays). Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy stupid humor and low-brow comedy just as much as any genuinely moronic and slovenly mouth-breathing member of Joe Public, but Ride Along is bottom-of-the-barrel stuff.The ""buddy cop"" sub-genre is apparently alive and well, despite the 1980s being a distant memory. Kevin Hart is a feckless school security guard who dreams of being a real cop. In order to impress his girlfriend's overprotective big brother (the Cube) he agrees to a ride-along for a day, unaware that he's being set up for humiliation. But his convenient geekiness just so happens to help solve an important case involving a local crime boss. Honestly, the plot is so thin it could be written on the back of a postage stamp and Tim Story (an ironic surname, for sure) seems to have learned nothing since his days directing Taxi, allowing his stars to improvise to save the weak scripted material. It doesn't work.Set in the cheap, tax-break city of Atlanta, the movie looks ugly, not just because of the non-cinematic locations but because Tim Story has no idea how to use a 2.35:1 frame and photographer Larry Blanford uses the unfortunate modern aesthetic of hard contrast with oversaturated colors instead of creating an atmosphere in-camera. It's shot in amamorphic Panavision, but you'll never notice as it is so flat and nasty looking.Kevin Hart is funny but this is not a good vehicle for him. It made a lot of money, hence the sequel, but I honestly thought that this sub-genre died with the painfully unfunny Showtime back in 2002 (Remember that? No?). If you've seen one, you've seen the other, you've seen them all.Always, always, always be ex-treme-ly weary and cynical of movies that have outtakes over the end credits.I should have just watched Dragnet."
" An enjoyably crime comedy
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"James Payton is a gruff Atlanta cop determined to bring down Omar, a crime boss who is so secretive that many doubt he really exists. Ben Barber is a school security guard who spends his free time playing video games... he is also living with Payton's sister and hopes to marry her. Barber successfully applies to the Police Academy so Payton invites him to spend a day with him learning what it means to be a cop... hoping that it will lead to him changing his mind. He asks the dispatcher to send him to the most annoying calls; asking bikers to move from a handicapped parking zone, dealing with a drunk in a market and asking a child to divulge the whereabouts of his criminal brother. A stop at a shooting range provides an unexpected lead to Omar. Before the day is over things are going to get far more dangerous than either man expected.This isn't the greatest of police comedies but it still provides a decent number of laughs and a solid enough central story. Ice T and Kevin Hart are fun as Payton and Barber; two very contrasting characters. It is very easy to believe that Payton really doesn't like his prospective brother in law... admittedly Barber is one of those characters who are amusing in a film but would be infuriating in real life. It is Hart who brings most of the laughs as Barber gets caught up in events that he doesn't really understand. The action is decent enough with a fun little car chase at the start and a good shootout and explosion at the end. There aren't too many surprises but that isn't really a problem as the hunt for Omar is there so we can see our protagonists in a dangerous situation rather than just the early 'Code 126' annoying callouts. Overall this certainly isn't up there with the likes of 'Beverly Hills Cop' or 'Lethal Weapon' but it is better than some of their sequels... not a must see but fun if you enjoy the genre."
" Ride Along feels more like a tame carousel than a thrilling rollercoaster.
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,4,"I will still openly admit that I'm not a fan of Kevin Hart, his comedy just doesn't do anything for me. However, I'm always open to new opportunities that may alter my thoughts on his humour. Unsurprisingly, this film doesn't do that. A rookie police cadet who spends most of his time gaming joins his girlfriend's brother, who is an experienced officer, for a day of training to get some experience. Essentially a comedic imitation of 'Training Day', just one that isn't very funny...or humorous at all. Yet another American comedy where I did not smile, chuckle, laugh out loud or snigger. I was my usual emotionless self. The comedic moments come from the juxtaposing personalities of Ice Cube and Kevin Hart, who's onscreen chemistry felt incredibly natural together, where the latter is supposed to provide the laughs with his hyperbolic body language and high-pitched shouting. It just does nothing for me. Just Hart being Hart, in every single film he is in. Cube on the other hand is more likely to get a smile from me due to his natural deadpan delivery of the shoddy dialogue that was provided. The screenplay was uninspired as it solely strolls down the route of racial stereotypes and ""oh, you're black so you act like this"" and so forth. Unoriginality at its most obvious. The plot itself was a generic forgettable ball of nothingness that only became established during the third act. What I will say is the last thirty minutes were enjoyably watchable, the action is elevated with some buoyancy and committed combat choreography from its actors although edited haphazardly with quick cuts aplenty. The pace moves along at a steady rate and never dips to boring levels, but the aura of mediocrity that surrounds the action ""comedy"" just cannot be ignored. No laughs however certainly watchable. Just, it's a ride that I don't necessarily want to be part of again. Maybe the sequel can entice me into appreciating Hart's humour...(yeah, right)."
" I'M CRAZY, BUT IN A GOOD WAY
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Ben ""The Black Hammer"" Barber (Kevin Hart) is living with Angela (Tika Sumpter) the sister of super cop James Payton (Ice Cube). Ben works as a school security guard and aspires to be a policeman like James. Ben plays video games and is not highly thought of by James. When Ben asks James permission to marry his sister, James wants Ben to prove himself by going on a ""ride along."" While James puts Ben through the comedy ringer, he is looking for the elusive Omar (Laurence Fishburne), a major crime boss in the city.The plot was fairly simple and didn't develop the complexity or irony I was hoping for, i.e. Omar being part of Ben's on-line gamers. The comedy was akin to skit comedy with scenes being almost unrelated and the comedy of one scene not building on another. Of course one shouldn't expect too much from the guy who brought us ""Employee of the Month.""The movie is a good popcorn film good for a few laughs."
" One of the worst buddy or buddy cop films ever made
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,1,"Plot; Security guard Ben must prove himself to his girlfriend's brother, top police officer James. He rides along James on a 24-hour patrol of Atlanta.This is one of the top 5 worst buddy or buddy cop films ever made. Both Ice Cube and Kevin Hart have zero chemistry with each other, Cube looks like he is bored doing this and is only doing these films for the paycheck, Hart is annoying as hell trying to be a Chris Tucker wannabe and failing. The story is generic, uninteresting, and overall boring. The action is lackluster and unmemorable. The only positive thing I can say is Laurence Fishburne who actually tries to give a performance unlike everyone else in this film.This is easily one of the worst buddy or buddy cop films ever made, don't watch it if you haven't seen it, watch good ones like Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout, Showdown in Little Tokyo, Bad Boys, Tango and Cash just to name a few."
" Not a bad film starring Kevin Hart
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,6,"Ride Along is a 2014 action crime comedy starring Ice Cube and Kevin Hart and tells the story of a trainee cop played by Hart who wants to marry his girlfriend. Of course his girlfriend's brother is a cop played by Cube and in order for Hart's character to prove to Cube's character that he wants to marry his girlfriend,Cube's character decides to train Hart's character and learns to prove himself.Now this type of film has been done before,you know what is gonna happen straight away and I am now becoming a fan of Kevin Hart's as I didn't know who he was till last year when he was in another action crime comedy called Central Intelligence. Overall I enjoyed it it was a decent flick and I was glad to have gotten it on Blu Ray and a good price."
" Better than the sequel.
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,7,"Ride Along is one of those examples that some sequels shouldn't be made, if they're going to do a sequel it better be as good or even better than the first. Ride Along is a pretty good buddy action comedy flick, some of the dialogue could have been changed, some of it is crass and unnecessary, but other than that it's fine, when it comes to the comedy it isn't even funny, there's only two scenes that are humorous and that is the scene where ""Ben"" (Kevin Hart) mistakes a woman for a man and where ""Ben"" pretends to be ""Omar"", the movie overall is watchable.The twist is predictable and is barely even a twist, it's so clichÃ© that that plot-twist is in 80% of cop-themed films.The pacing of the film is perfect and has a cool instrumental hip hop film score composed by Christopher Lennertz.The performances are natural, the scenery is not all that, ""Ben's"" apartment however is very nice although on his salary as a high school security guard i doubt he would be able to afford a place like that in reality and it is never established what his fiancÃ© does for a living.Great chemistry between Ice Cube and Kevin Hart, the Trivia says this movie was originally going to star Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds - that would not have worked, they just seem like a wrong pairing.Ride Along 2 was slightly funny at times, but it was extremely boring, Ride Along 1 is more serious, the sequel was trying to be too much like the first one with basically the same plot.Hopefully Ride Along 3 will have a better story than the sequel and hopefully it'll be as good as or even better than the first one.If you like your buddy/comedy flicks, Ride Along is worth watching more than once."
" Meh...not great
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,4,"Making things more frozen than necessary is Ice Cube, scrunching up his face in attempting to portray a hard-ass of a cop; one of those lone, righteous moralists who is willing to go against any and all authority in order to prove himself as being right all along about his case. Of course he is, but what is confusing is how the film seems to condemn his behavior as a loner, yet justifies his actions during the course of the story. It is never clear which side the movie falls on and it most likely does not matter. Truthfully, none of the characters or plot points seem necessary at all except to showcase the difference between Hart's ambitious high-school security guard trying to become an Atlanta policeman and Ice Cube's tough-as-nails detective on the hunt for the most ferocious kingpin in the city, so terrifying and imposing that no one has ever seen his face (You will guess who it is right away; the opening credits give it away)."
