" Amazing!!
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,10,"Saw a few minutes of it, and from what I saw the characters look ultra-realistic while it's CGI hard to tell where the CGI begins and the reality ends."
" Stunning!
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,10,BRING US MORE!!!Keep the same CGI crew and pay them a boat load because this was absolutely incredible!
" REMARKABLE ANIMATION
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,9,WOW....just wow. How has this movie been out so long and I haven't heard about it???The animation is freaking amazing for something that was done in 2016. The whole dead eye thing that you see in most animations is not even noticeable. The fight scenes are immaculate and the storyline was pretty clean up until the end scene where it go slightly confusing with the appearance of the giant monsters.
" Wish there was a 20 Star Rating
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,10,"We don't even NEED actors anymore! The CG in this Movie is so SPOT ON, I mean you can see every whisker, scar, even a piece of spinach in their teeth! Just AMAZING CG!I've LOVED all the ""Final Fantasy's "" but Kingsglaive is by FAR the Best yet!PLEASE don't stop making these!!!!!BRILLIANT!"
" A Masterpiece
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie is truly something else, I have watched both of the other Final Fantasy movies and this one totally blows them away when it comes to visuals, special effects, character voicing etc.The glaive are so awesome to watch in action and the power granted to the wearer of the ring by the old kings of Lucien is truly spectacular. The old wall is even cooler if that's possible and had me ranting and raving about them as they were activated in defense of the city of Lucius.The storyline however is not as strong especially for someone new to the final fantasy verse. I myself have played one of the games and watched the previous movies but I was still a little lost. The story in the movie is more self contained and doesn't tie into the other movies. I assume it probably ties in better to the games but as I haven't played them all I cannot say.However if you want to see a amazing animation and magic and fighting and incredible special effects watch this film."
" A Masterpiece. Simples.
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,10,"Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV is an absolute Masterpiece.
Even though it originally was produced in 2016, it is still just as visually stunning.
What really grabbed my attention this time (apart from all of the wonderfully sublime world building stuff)
was the use of lighting, especially for a CGI animated movie, the overall lighting design resembles a
complete work of art. I have the other two Final Fantasy movies in my extensive Anime collection.
However Kingsglaive is by far the more spectacular, epic driven, brilliant movie.
Also, it's CGI effects are reference quality.
There was several times when I was left somewhat speechless and in total awe of exactly did the film makers
achieve any of this. I mean, Kingsglaive is the gold standard of all of what can be achieved with the several
dosens of animators, digital artists & graphic designers, motion capture designers, production crews,
simulation operators - everyone involved in the making of this masterpiece.
Also the voice artists involved included Sean Bean, Lena Headey, Adrian Bouchet and Aaron Paul.
Also the sound department deserve much high praise.
Kingsglaive is a must-see for any fanboys interested in what a real visually breathtaking masterpiece
actually looks like. And it is a perfect 10/10, even with some minor flaws.
Outstanding, yes.
Also still way way way ahead of it's time."
" Headache inducing mess
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,1,"So much going on, that you can't tell what's going on.Poor audio mixing, soso cgi, extremely boring story, with an ending that makes you mad you wasted the time watching it."
" a perfect movie for a prequel to the actual game.
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,People giving low scores might not seem to understand its a prequel story to the game & therefore that ending. once u played/finished the game ull see how brilliant it is and all the characters unselfishly did their parts in order to give others a future. one of the best final fantasy stories.
" 2/10 sci-fi Audis
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,2,I thought the pretty animation would be enough to hold my attention throughout a film meant to set up a video game I have no investment in. I was wrong.Why does Audi exist in this universe? This is literally the only question this film left me with.
" A surprising 10!!!
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,10,"Wow! With the 6.8 imdb overall rating, I had hopes for something decent but not great.But this was GREAT!!Alright, first some caveats. I don't play the game. I don't know much about the game. But I saw FFXV Brotherhood and it was GREAT! So I got Kingsglaive.And it was AMAZINGLY GOOD!!-GREAT CGI!
-GREAT sound track!
-GREAT story! (couldn't predict the twists and ending)
-INTELLIGENT script!
-GREAT fight sequences!Seriously. This may be the first 10/10 I've given out but I simply enjoyed every minute of it that much! I got part way through and was sad and scared to check the time display and find out it was almost over-- then I saw I was only half-way through and was THRILLED I could enjoy it longer!!Hats off to the team that did this! Really class-A work! Encouraging/strengthening, inspiring, entertaining. The full trifecta!Refreshed this old warriors bones for the next round of my own battles!!! LET'S GO!!!!!"
" Did you forget?
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,7,"Perfect animation action movie!People here expected too high, did u forget if this movie is just game intro? the rest of the story is in the game later."
" Another mostly meaningless action movie
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,3,"Oh how I miss the creativity in plot and visuals of the first Final Fantasy movie, The Spirits Within, from 2001. That was a meaningful movie! Some people said it was ""complex"", but I thought its complexity reflected a richness of story. To this day, 18 years later, I still remember it fondly.To me, Kingsglaive is the opposite. It's yet another mostly meaningless action movie. It seems like 80 to 90% of the screen time is action sequences. Even Final Fantasy XV the game has more percent of time spent on character and story development, and less percent of time on mere action sequences. You cannot tell me that Kingsglaive is a meaningful movie. Even the action sequences at the end moved so fast it was a bit hard to follow. The action sequences are not even epic army sequences like Lord of the Rings (for example, Battle of Helms Deep), but were small numbers battles, often one hero versus one or a couple of enemies (as another user review that I read noted)."
" my notes
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,1,Terrible horrible pointless and dumb. Had a few cool opening moments. The rest of the movie was ridiculously boring. And some terrible action with nothing in the ending to make up for the terrible movie. The animation looks great and overall it looks very good. Except for the lack of emotions in their faces and the horrible lip syncing. I left about 10 minutes early because it couldn't take it anymore (1 viewing)
" The great advertising of new title!
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,8,"I got the urge to play a game as soon as I watched this. It was a kind of advertising of new one from final fantasy series. I believe that a person who built the performance of warp must be a genus!
I decid to rewatch it many times!But I could never forgive character voice of Lunafreya by Shiori Kutsuna! I was disappointed in her reading whithout intonation."
" Highly underrated
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,10,"I have seen several movies regarding or based on video game, yet none not even close of Kingslaive. I also saw the other two Final Fantasy movies and neither of them is even half good as this one. This isn't a masterpiece overall, has its own flawes, but nonetheless it's a great and solid movie, worth watching and rewatching.
The CGI is spectaculos, so realistic and well-made, carrying you truly into a story, a fantasy. We see new power additions to the word, the eye-catching warp magic forged by the blink dagger of the glaive which is a pretty cool thing to watch.
But above all are the character, many of them very interesting -I really wanted to know even more about each of them- and the story itself. Some said the plot is not coherent enough. I think those people did not paid enough atention, especially at the prologue. Kingsglaive is not just a story about battles and special effects, it's a story about duty, about courage, about sacrificies and responsabilities. You care for those characters and their fates. It tells a good and engaging story, something that movies nowadays completly lacking. It has soul and sentiment. It has a message.
Don't mind the critics and the low-rated reviews. Give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised."
" Didn't play the game yet
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,10,"I rarely write a review here, but this film was special.
Didn't get all the hate here.
It's not a game of thrones episode, but if you see it as what it is - a animated fantasy film, it's effing great.
Story wise it was a solid 7. The animation was beyond a 10. I was instant hooked by the voices of our beloved GoT characters and Aaron Paul.
People are so serious and complain that it's not a masterpiece like their favorite movie.See it as it is. Nice popcorn cinema with a beautiful eye catcher!"
" Fantastic
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,9,"Forget the critics...It's a must watch anime..specially Final fantasy lover...
Really amazing movie"
" Amazing movie
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,10,Excellente movie about what happened. Just what i wanted.
" Good tie in to Final Fantasy XV
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,6,I saw this movie yesterday and I have to say it's not a bad movie for the graphics. But in plot wise it's pretty boring.The voice actors are good and the action sequences were decent. But the last fight scene felt like it was going on for hours.Anyways its a decent film for graphics but not for plot.
" well ...
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,1,"This movie was a waste of time
can't believe i've spent the first 2hours of 2018 watching this ..."
" Good game-play but weak story and characters
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,7,"Overall, the game-play was pretty good, but I expected more considering the time Square Enix spent developing this game. I liked how the developers tried to cater for newcomers to the Final Fantasy franchise with simple game-play mechanics and threw in some new ideas. The open world design was not bad either, and travelling around in your car/chocobo was a lot of fun.The biggest complaint I have is with the story and the characters in this game. The main story line isn't very compelling and some parts don't make much sense, even more so if you haven't seen the other materials made for FFXV. The characters lack depth and aren't developed very well. Noctis and Lunafreya's little love story has little to no back story and zero romance with an anticlimactic end. Noctis is not much of a hero to look up to, he's just an over-emotional spoiled brat. Ignis is pretty much a nanny-robot. Only Prompto and Gladius were characters that felt right; Prompto brought a light-hearted humour to the four- man gang, and Gladius was the big brother that Noctis needed much to have his back and toughen him up. Ardyn's actions are confusing and his motives aren't explained very well. All the other characters are just one-dimensional and simply forgettable.Other minor complaints I have are with the camera and the lip syncing. The camera was all over the place; a lot of the times it is hard to tell what is going on, more so in small tight spaces. The lip- syncing was just disconnecting.All-in-all, even though my review contains mostly complaints, it was a good action RPG, but it definitely is the weakest in the Final Fantasy series in story and characters."
" My duty is my destiny
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,8,"The film opens with a rather lengthy introduction. I was confused by a number of things, like the princess staying behind and Lucis being the name of the good guy. Since when? Good guys in a city behind a wall. It is protected by the ""Divine Crystal"" whose magical powers are channeled through the aged King Lucis to both make a wall and give the Kingsglaive magical powers, particularly warping. Outside the city of Insomnia (seriously?) lives the evil empire with Starship Trooper bugs and a Kracken looking thing. They want the city and the rock.Like most films based on a game, there is little drama and a lot of fighting. I love the graphics and the Barbie Doll Uma Thurman Princess. My background is the gaming world is I played FF 1-8. Having spent the bulk of several months breeding and racing Chocobas, I got the sign on the truck. The film didn't allow me to connect to the characters. When a major character dies, I was emotionless unlike the week I had to take off of work when Aerith died. Apparently this game didn't having any healing spells as one character spends the entire film on a crutches.The plot twists around deceit and a royal wedding. And the ending...if I understand it...leaves things terribly open. Great action, great graphics, a plot you needed to pay attention to, and no Tifa Lockhart looking characters. Much better than the FFVII film."
" Best CGI movie I have ever seen.
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,10,"First of all, let me tell all those people who complain about the story, telling that it is just a trailer for the game: Yes, it might only be an introduction, and? The Star Wars universe has games that are better than the movies. Is comparing this film to SW irrelevant? I don't think so. There were reviews crying about there are only two sides. Why is that only a small group of people fights against that mechanized/robot army? Khmm.. Star Wars did the same (3 times). Only two sides? One technologically improved country conquers nearby countries, becomes the biggest and most advanced empire. There is a kingdom that has an ancient power, so it can defend itself and it's nearby countries against the ""empire"" who slowly annex all the remaining areas, and rule over them with a dictatorship, so there will remain two sides. Of course there will be rebellions within both sides, because of all the nations migrating into a different system and culture. So it's similar to WWs and SW. So watch this movie as an introduction to an other world, and if you are interested in it, you can read novels or watch the Brotherhood: Final Fantasy XV anime series that continues the story from the last scene of the film. (so before crying that it's a game promo film, read about it, so you can find something useful) I would give this film a 8 or 9, but I rated it as 10 because there are so many brainless reviews that I got a bit angry and wrote this review. So final words: If you want a great action/fantasy CGI film, this is just perfect for you. There is a ~5 sec long scene, with a car (futuristic Audi R8) that substitute a whole Fast and Furious film in action and imagination so as it was fun as hell."
" Best graphics in the world. Story not so much.
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,7,"Square Enix has a problem. Their ability to tell stories is just not good. For some reason they aim to sabotage their own story lines by forcing viewers to guess, and pick up on very vague hints that are revealed for just half a second. They always aim to mix too many stories together, while none of them carry any weight.That said. This film has got to be the most impressive CGI film in the history of movies as of 2017. If you want to see a demonstration of just how far CGI has come, without any compromise, you have to see this film. Pixar and most Hollywood studios can just go to bed. Square Enix Visual Works is simply the best CGI studio in the world.Thats why its also good this basically is just an action film. Loaded with amazing battles, wars and magic from the very start. So watch this movie knowing you want to see an awesome action pop corn movie. Not much else. Its just too bad that the convoluted story telling prevents viewers from understanding the meaning of it all."
" not a standalone film
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,10,"i see so many people complaining that the plot is too complicated or that they didn't know where it was coming from, what you have to understand is that the film is part of the game, its like an introduction, complaining about the plot is like watching the second harry potter but not the first or the third, yea sure it will be a good watch but you wont understand what is going on."
" That was awesome
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,9,"Alright, this movie might seriously have the best CGI I have ever seen in my entire life. Then again, I guess it's still not quite as good as ""The Adventures Of Tintin"". Nonetheless, there were so many times while watching this film that I confused it for a live-action movie. I mean, this is just so amazingly realistic! I'm glad we have more good movies for such a beloved franchise. I've now seen every ""Final Fantasy"" movie! Okay, there were only three of them, but still. It's hard not being a ""Final Fantasy"" fan, but the thing is, most of the games themselves aren't related to each other.With every movie, there are new characters so it's very difficult to keep up. This has a 13% on RottenTomatoes?! These people are completely insane! I mean, I guess the plot and characterizations could be a little better, but this is just an amazing film to look at with its fantastic action scenes. It's not like they make the whole movie one big fight scene. They really do have nice character development. Well, I can't really remember any of their names but that's because ""Final Fantasy"" has such a massive mythology that it's hard to keep up. It wasn't just one long video game cut scene. It was an epic film great in its own right. ***1/2"
" Pretty on the outside
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,7,"But I would argue, also pretty on the inside. While I'm not a Final Fantasy fan or someone who has played the games, I can say that I was more than entertained watching this. As far as friends are concerned who are more into this, they said there are a few things fans might pick up, but since this is a new story, a new tale, it's not something you have to have great knowledge of.The visuals are more than stunning too and the story is told in a fashion that leaves no one behind. Sometimes that can be a ""flaw"" for some, watching an animated movie that just is all over the place. This is easier that way. Still a lot of action, a lot of suspense and a really good build up. And for those interested, there is a stinger after the credits which probably has something to do with the game of the same name ..."
" Not Bad
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,7,"Honestly, we are not dealing with the film of the year! However, there are a lot of subtleties, the fan service is not outrageous, it is pretty well realized in the end, and the action is omnipresent. However, it should not be forgotten that this is a transmedia project that only serves as a promo to the next game: Final Fantasy XV!http://lesplayersdudimanche.com/final-fantasy-xv- kingsglaive-avis/"
" Computer game movie
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,5,"It is rather obvious, the name of the game included in the title and all, but it also aptly describes the movie. An animated movie, and for the most part animated well in my opinion, but heavily influenced by the game I presume. And when it comes to graphics, that's nothing bad. But when it comes to story, that's a different matter. Here, the media movie and game differs wildly. In games ( I should note that I have not played Final Fantasy and can't refer to that specific game) the story is pretty linear. One event after another, mostly one battle (or challenge) after another. That doesn't really cut it in a movie though. Here you need more of a background, more character and more of an explanation of why things is happening. The story in this is pretty thin about such things, but acceptable if you think of it as a simple action movie. The ending though is a letdown. It is not much of a ending at all. No resolution of what becomes of the characters or what they fought for. It is nothing more but an empty promise of more, a next challenge or battle. I guess the story continues in a game somewhere, making this one of the longest commercials ever made.5/10"
" One of my favorite films
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,10,"To start with, I have to say that this is the first film of the saga I watch, my interest in it began when I played the video game. First I saw it with the thought that the game is a masterpiece, willing to know whether the film was a match for the game or not. I must admit it is ; Takeshi Nozue has done a very good job, and the film is really worth to be seen. I think it must be a difficult thing to do, create a film based in a video game. It can't be easy, but the way in which Nyx, Libertus and the rest of the characters have been developed is absolutely amazing, so good that you want them to have their own game, that way you would be able to play and enjoy it. However, there is no perfect film, and there is a part I didn't like that much. It is the battle between the General and Nyx carrying the ring of Lucii. Everything happened too fast, and there where parts of the fight in which I couldn't distinguish one character from the other.In summary my opinion of this FF15 film is very positive. I had a great time and I really think it is worth spending a couple of hours watching it specially if you are keen on the video game"
" Fantastic Computer Animation But Not Much Plot
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,10,"Knowing nothing of the Final Fantasy game or the plot, I rented this DVD specifically because of the intriguing preview. I wasn't aware if each was part of a single far-reaching story or a standalone film. Though this one seemed a mere episode, with very little explanation and a negligible individual plot, I found this snippet intriguing. I also was confused of the relationship between the characters in the prologue and this was never really explained. Those who follow the story probably had no such problem. One irritating point throughout was the way scenes would fade to black with several seconds of blank space between scenes. I also thought the presence of very contemporary-looking cars, as well as hollow-point bullets in the weapons to be a little anachronistic set alongside the monsters and magic.What mainly impressed me, however, was the animation, which is...fantastic! To date, my viewing of live-action animations using computer graphics has been limited to three films, and this is the best one yet. It doesn't take much to accept that these characters are real actors and not computer graphic images. In spite of the fact they sometimes moved faster than an actual human could and performed impossible feats, they did look real. With only two exceptions, they appear lifelike. Lip movement and mouth shape was synced perfectly with the words being spoken. Where usually the features on these kind of images are bland, on these the detail, from wrinkles and expressions to individual strands of hair is near-perfect. Only the eyes gave away their artificiality. Though they moved and blinked, there was still a certain glassy, unfocused quality about them, as if the artists neglected them and instead concentrated on the faces.One character was a little disconcerting--and disturbing--the Tom Baker Dr. Who-lookalike Neflheim councilor. With his big floppy hat and long muffler, he seemed completely out of place among the flowing robes and slightly medieval garb of the other characters, making me wonder if this was a tongue-in-cheek homage.This was an entertaining film. Since it was an episode instead of a complete story, it did made me wish I'd come in at the beginning. I'm now intrigued enough to look up the others."
" An animation that hits the mission to make the game make more sense, more sins in many other things.
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,7,"Well when I cleared the Final Fantasy XV game, I saw many problems in the story, and left many loose ends, there I discovered this movie Kingslaive, and decided to watch to see if the history of the game improved, well the story is far from great, But the movie left the game better, and more closed, the quality of the animation is animal, CGI very well done, had moments that I thought was real, we learned more of Regis that does not get to have a great participation, and we see more Aaron Paul, Lena Headey, Sean Bean, all great, the characters are interesting, we also get more from the Lunafreya, and from other characters, the dialogues sin in some things, the characters in the movie. Kingslaive I found them uninteresting, taking out the Nyx Ulric, the battles are cool, and the animation is also a bit violent. Note 7.5"
" Perfect graphic, basically no story
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,3,"The movie did an amazing work on the graphics. Texture, light, everything looks very real. Since many war scene are involved, there're plenty explosions to demonstrate the cutting edge CGI work.However, if you didn't read anything about the story in advance, the movie will make no sense to you.You can feel it when an important character shows up. Yet since there's no introduction on the back ground story, the things characters do make no sense to you. If you played any FF game in the past, some of the things is very obvious, like the ring. But the overall story telling is very poor. Huge monsters show up with no explain, huge statue come alive and no one in the movie surprised.I guess I wasn't the only asking myself what's going on again and again. I hope the story completes itself in the game."
" Great for FF Fans
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,9,"I watched this movie after beating the game and it was amazing!It filled tons of missing plot information that you don't gather from the video game.I love how it ties from the movie to the video game as well with the ending of the movie and the beginning of the video game.I think in order to appreciate the movie you need to get the story line of the game.I can see how the story line just by the movie alone would be very confusing to viewers however regardless of if you watched the movie first then played the video game, vice versa, you will be asking yourself questions without the other half.Regardless though as a witness to both sides, I absolutely loved it!"
