" Ticks all the boxes
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,10,"You know it's a good film when you come on here and write a review. Chloe Moretz gave a superb performance, really drawing you into the character and in turn the illness suffered, bringing with it awareness to a condition that had gone misdiagnosed for many years. Giving real thought to how many people may have been treated for psychiatric conditions instead. Think the cast was perfect for the film, Richard Armitage always seems to play these roles and with good reason."
" Amazing üëè
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,"Really really nice movie, talk about mental and physical diseases, diagnostic... I really cried at the end, moreover it's based on true story."
" Very impressed and phenomenal acting.
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,9,"For no particularly good reason, I hadn't got my hopes up for this movie. However I was absolutely stunned by the end of it. Phenomenal acting by Chloe Grace-Moretz as usual. So realistic in terms of the characters, their reactions, and was played so well by the cast. Pretty straight forward storyline but not necessarily a bad thing.
I found myself crying exactly when the characters were which I always say means the scenes are clearly being played well!"
" An interesting dramatic insight into a rare disease
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,7,"Susannah, a promising reporter with a bright future ahead, suddenly starts facing strange symptoms, that progressively but quickly make her lose the touch with reality, compromising her job, her relationships and her family. The movie, inspirated from a real story, is the dramatic but realistic journey towards a diagnosis and, eventually, a treatment.
The story is well put, the acting is on point, and it is very easy to be emotionally involved with the main character and her familiy; what is lacking is the pace, especially at the beginning the movie seems to jump too quickly towards the climax, leaving little time to know Susannah and the other characters."
" Nice biography movie..!
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,8,"A young girl suffered from some brain disease and her behaviour become too weird..soo her patents and lover try to diagnose but there is not improvement..finally a x-doctor who is working in college finsout her problem and make her to normal...
Must watch moie.."
" The Book Is Always Better....
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,1,Yes the book is always better but in this case the book is great and the film is an absolute dumpster fire. The script is awful and the screenwriter would want to study the craft. Also perhaps Chloe Grace isn't the sensational we all hoped she would be? Or maybe she is just picking terrible scripts and phoning it in.
" This really caught my attention
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,7,This was not what i was expecting (in a good way) I'm still unsure about certain acting but then again I suppose it's playing the part. This film was really good.
" Amm no
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,3,"First of all it was too short for a story like this also was boring
Second they left the most important event which was her disease for the last minutes also they didn't mention the treatment Period so suddenly she was fine?!!"
" Take it from someone with this exact diagnosis
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,10,"This movie is an extremely raw, accurate depiction of what this disease does to you. Everything she experienced in this movie is truly what it was like having NMDA Receptor encephalitis and I can say that because I have the same diagnosis. I'm giving this movie a 10 because it truly accurately accounts what it is like to have this neurological condition. The only difference is as far as I know I remember virtually everything! There are things my family members and boyfriend remember differently and that is okay because they are allowed to have their own interpretation of what they saw and experienced themselves. However, I was the only person with myself 24/7 and that has got to count for a lot when it comes to my personal opinion on how this movie truly captured what this disease is like. So ignore the 6.6 star rating and take a chance to watch it. Coming from someone with lived experience."
" This movie does not justified the book of Susannah Cahalan's diagnosis journey
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,3,First of all it's a movie which is based in true story of Susannah Cahalan. I haven't read the book yet but I can tell that this wasn't really how all happened which is the film makers shawn by this film. I don't know why I felt weird watching this movie. Everyone's act weird and i felt clor√©'s overact . I mean why film makers choose clor√© for main role. She is absolutely great actor but in this movie she was not fit for Susannah Cahalan role. I really didn't feel connected with this film completely because their weirdness act. They could make it far better then this. Maybe people get disappointed by reading my review but I suggest you should watch it too because of awareness. In a word This film does not justified the book of Susannah Cahalan's journey.
" Chloe is amazing in this! Very touching especially as a true story
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,8,Whilst watching this movie all I could think was OMG this is based on a true stormy. How frightening for all. So well presented I loved it!
" Good acting and the story told in a very good way
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,8,"I don't understand why the critics gave this movie such low ratings. Everyone was acting very good, Speccialy the head character. The way they filmed the distance Susannah was experiencing from the world around her. You also understand the doctors who doesn't know what it can be. They did their best with knowledge they had. She was lucky there was a doctor who didn't gave up.
It is realy a very good movie to watch."
" Nice Movie.
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,7,You suffer from.But the script is good.A nice Movie.
" Hard to Watch When You Have Lived It
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,9,"It is very difficult to watch. Cases like this are all too real, I should know as I have lived it.
Brain on fire talks about a person becoming sick and the doctors have no idea what is going on with the individual. All tests that the person takes shows up normal but they are still very sick. In her case, thank God, the doctors eventually discovered what is wrong and was able to treat it. She is able to recover most of her life after some hard work. For many out there, the reality is, there is no help."
" Compelling
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,8,"As someone who has illnesses that have escaped the medical profession, I appreciate the subtle message this movie conveys that our health care system is severely broken. My hope is that more people persist and continue to push for greater competence and accountability so people like this can receive the treatment they deserve."
" Most would not understand
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,7,"This movie resonates with me. As a parent, I know what it's like to watch the so called medical experts come to incomplete conclusions to proclaim misdiagnoses without considering ALL the facts."
" Underrated
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,9,This was a good movie. Plus it has an actual purpose.
" Worth watching
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,7,"Don't expect a masterpiece. And just watch, it's worth your time. I wish it would have been more in depth, less Hollywood-ish, more informative. But still, since it is the way it is, that means a lot of people who wouldn't watch a heavy informative movie about very rare diseases, will watch this. That's not to be underestimated.And people who will want more after this movie will read the book and google the research etc. So. Yeah.Just watch it."
" Spot-on realistic drama
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,"What the negative reviews here do not understand is how very realistic and accurate this movie is. It's obvious some viewers came to be entertained... and missed the point of the movie entirely. This is not a movie intended to entertain; it is intended to inform and educate.I had a close family member with undiagnosed major epilepsy for many years. There is nothing more frustrating than to have test after test after test, only to have supposed specialists look you in the eye and tell you ""There's nothing wrong""... when very obviously something is wrong.The downsides:* The beginning and ending narratives could have been left out and the entire movie handled dramatically rather than using a cheap intro and exit. There is no ""cheap intro"" to mental illness. It can come on slowly or very quickly, but there is no convenient voice-over introduction.* One scene of totally gratuitous nudity (without which this movie could have received a PG instead of PG-13 rating).* The sudden far-too-short ""picket fence"" ending rather than the long-term, emotional, challenging-in-every-way recovery that was part of this process. Again the ""cheap voice over exit"" did the movie great disservice. I'd have liked to see another half hour added to it with a proper ending helping people to understand the entire thing, not just the hospital stay.These issues are why I rate this 7 stars instead of 10. Nevertheless, what we see of the story was superbly done and deserves a nod of approval in making the public aware of some issues involved with mental illness-- not the least of which is medical incompetence and not caring enough about the patient to think outside the ""standard diagnosis"" box (something that I've seen over and over).The acting was superb-- especially that of the main actress Chloe Moretz, who presented all issues from initial ""blanking"" to grand-mal seizures with astonishing realism.The doctors were convincing. None of them were mean or had ill-intent; they were just incompetent and took a lot for granted. (Yes, I've significant observational experience with such medical staff. There's no end to the ""we find nothing wrong"" excuse rather than caring enough to find out what's wrong.) The frustration of the parents-- while seeming over the top-- quite realistic after going through so much garbage diagnosis they just couldn't take it any more. Not all people are like this... but such frustration is realistic.In short, with the exceptions stated above this was a very well-written, well-directed and superbly-acted movie. If anyone wants to understand what people go through in a ""brain fire"" situation... this movie is about as good a presentation as I could imagine."
" Forgot the fundamentals for a good movie
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,2,"Lacks the most fundamental aspects for a good movie. Thus, it fails to make it interesting, suspenseful, emotional or enjoyable...The main character is too distant to feel empathy for. The acting is a bit too over-the-top and the dialogue is quite plain.The story lacks urgency and the eventual threat was riddiculously puny. There were several potential threats that could have done the movie a big favour.Although it is based on a true story and therefore has limitations - never forget the fundamentals for a good movie!"
" Simple but beautiful
",2020-07-22 00:00:00,7,"Very solid story but perhaps the original intention of the film was to make the public aware of this rare disease, so the script is quite flat and straightforward, and there was nothing particularly exciting plot and presented a documentary like way. Chlo√´ acts convincing that touches most of us. Her parent presents well about all those suffering and the sound effect is good too."
" 1 of the finest Chloe Moretz movies
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,9,"The disease needed a bit more of explanation towards the end, however Chloe Grace Moretz has perfectly managed to uplift this Netflix movie with her thunderous and solid acting, perhaps her career best performance after the Kick-Ass duology"
" Starts slow and weak, but then turns serious, believable, tense, and I was dying to know what was going on!
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,10,"100.00% spoiler-free. Must-read! Must-watch!I watched this movie based on just the two-sentence description on Netflix. Did not even watch a trailer or check ratings. Just dived in blind. I am soooooooo glad I did that. Just a simple google search on this movie would reveal major spoilers about the story, so do yourselves a favor and do NOT read any spoilers about this movie. Do NOT google it and do not watch trailers. Just dive in blind like I usually do.Those that gave the film low scores must have read about the plot's mystery premise and spoiled it for themselves before watching the movie. I knew zero about the film and that is why it was so effective in getting a 10 out of me.Review:The film started out slow and weak and I assumed it would be a bad movie. I contemplated quitting.But to my huge surprise, the movie got better and better. The ""major conflict/premise"" in the film continued to escalate to the point that I became genuinely deeply concerned for the protagonist and I was fully immersed in finding out, just like her parents and boyfriend, what in the world was going on with her.The protagonist Chlo√´ Grace Moretz I thought did an excellent job in her role. Excellent acting. It felt believable. It felt completely real. I was very impressed. At first the movie was slow and her acting was not shining, but later it showed. Pleasantly surprised!Carrie-Anne Moss - a star in the Matrix trilogy; unfortunately, I was very disappointed in her acting. It was probably the fault of the director Gerard Barrett who did not properly tell her how a MOTHER is supposed to act? I mean, not even a tear? Seriously? Not a moment of emotional breakdown?Richard Armitage - portrays the father. I had no idea who this actor was, but his acting was very believable. He genuinely looked like a real concerned father. His concern was extremely believable. I loved it. His acting made the film feel believable and 100% real.The rest of the supporting cast were decent/fine. Nothing spectacular but acceptable.This movie felt completely believable. So believable that half-way though the movie, when things got so serious, I suspected something, which I will not say.After I finished the film I read ALL about the origins of the story, which I will not disclose. Do NOT google it and just watch it blindly, if you want to enjoy it to the fullest.Conclusion: movie starts out slow and weak and maybe a little boring, but it gets really good. Gets good from half-way through the movie until the end. This movie was well-made and deserves a 10. Those people who gave it low scores most likely read about the plot before watching the film and spoiled it for themselves so the film does not have the same impact if you already read about its plot right?"
" NOT YOUR AVERAGE DISEASE OF THE MONTH FLICK
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,7,"Xlnt little flick on little known brain disorder. Viewer feels the helplessness, hopelessness and fear, not only of the patient, but also of everyone else involved. Good secondary relationships too. Carrie Ann Moss stands out, as usual. Very scary, enjoyed it"
" Great movie!
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,9,"After seeing the film, which, by the way, pleasantly impressed me, I started to document myself about the disease that the protagonist of the film suffered from and I honestly came to appreciate the film even more.And hats off to Chlo√´ Grace Moretz, she really did a great job as Susannah Cahalan!The film deserves a much greater appreciation from the public because it draws attention with medical accuracy and enough cinematic mastery to a very rare medical condition, and on a larger scale it raises awarness about the mental illness theme, which unfortunately it's an extremely relatable theme."
" Great movie
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,9,"It was a rollercoaster of emotions of sad, happy, and laughter crazy to think that it was based on a true story!!"
" Unbelievably bland
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,3,The film takes it's entirety to tell you the diagnosis. During that time it's simply filled with snippets of symptoms that are tedious and repetitive. The film contains no real narrative other than the attempt at discovering the diagnosis of the main character.
" It was okay
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,6,"Why is an mri a big scary thing?! I have pelvis mri every year...
about the movie; I have never read the book. I never heard of this story, accidentally saw the trailer on YouTube. It's an interesting movie, but won't watch it again. Currently having an ongoing problem too, lung problems and they don't know what causes, I have normal blood test,etc..but sometimes coughing up blood, many times having flu-kinda symptoms and memory loss. It's been now more than a year and they still don't know. Giving me false diagnoses. Doctors are human beings, I can relate to that too, and I am sure they're trying their best. I am glad she is feeling better. The movie worth to watch once. Nothing special. Actors are good. But I expected more. A real drama. It is somehow not."
" Good movie but wish I had that diagnosis!!
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,9,"Great movie but as someone who has been in and out of psychiatry for many years it was sad for me! But excellent depiction! Had an mri for the first time a few years ago but alas no joy! I go into deep spells of psychosis every few years out of the blue! Wish it could be classified as autoimmune and treatable n cured! Nevertheless have learnt so much to balance my life and have become so grounded and spiritually connected! Was always quite psychic as a child! But deffo such an unexplored world out there! And having been given many psychiatric diagnosis...which I don't believe in (psychosis is the only term I deal with as I kinna have to put some name on it! N psychosis is quite spiritual to me! It has meaning!!)
But I believe bipolar/schizophrenia etc do not exist!!! We r just very psychically open people that need a wide range of resources to live a full life!!! Overall illness in general should be treated holistically which is sad with this movie and story! Really loved the doctor in the end as he really connected with her spirit which by far is the most important aspect of healthcare!!!
Wish we had movies that depicted psychiatry and spiritual well-being!!! That's what I'd like to see! My movie would just take to long to get to the point n no easy fix which this girl thankfully had in the end!!!
Good job with the depiction thou!
Ps!!! Anyone having issues with their mental health: haloperidol which was a drug she was given is lethal!!! I was given it once in hospital and became completely locked inside my body!!! Terrible drug!!
Olanzapine I put on so much weight and was hungry all the time!
I'm now off lithium a year after been on it 10 years n thank god I got off it!! My metabolism, energy and life is more balanced!
Pps: some drugs are harder to get off as side effects are tough! Always get more than two or three specialists in a few areas of health And well-being to help u off them slowly!!!
There are so many untold stories out there!!!
Much love to anyone going through tough times!"
" Very captivating
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,7,"I was super into this movie start to finish . Very interesting , extremely sad , you can feel the frustration from every party involved and incredible that it is a true story .I would recommend this to everyone , intense start to finish and you learn a lot ."
" Brain on Fire
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,9,9/10 - brilliant film that explores an under-recognized condition through wonderful storytelling and brilliant acting
" A story that needs to be told
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,10,"I think it's amazing that a story like this is turned into a film to spread awareness. Sadly, I myself went through a sickness a few years back that wasn't very common and can mistreated. So it's great to see a story like this be told.Susannah Cahalan (Chlo√´ Grace Moretz) is your every day who appears to have her life all sorted with a great job, adorable boyfriend, and a loving family.
When Susannah starts to experience flu like symptoms, her behaviour becomes unexpected where local GP's are unsure with what could be going on.
With her parents knowing their child best, they seek help from other doctors and hospitals where Susannah's sickness becomes worse quickly.A truely incredible film. As I mentioned earlier, I've experienced a rare illness myself where I was able to relate to this film and understand the frustrations of when local GP's brush it off and tell you have something else to get you out of their office.
As I tell most of friends, you know your body better than anyone else and if you're starting to feel unwell, even if it's a small flu symptom such as a cough, treat it like your life depends on it, cause you never know if that cough if is a serious symptom or not till it's possibly too late.I highly recommend this film. Hopefully it opens the eyes to a lot of people that just because you've never experienced something similar or know of anyone who has it doesn't mean you'll never get it. These things happen at the most random times with not a lot of notice."
" Beware of Iatrogenic Death!
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,4,"Most people are probably unaware of this fact, but more deaths are caused each year by doctors (iatrogenic death) than by car accidents. So, yes, physicians are human beings who make mistakes. No news there.The story of the protagonist here is based on her book which was billed as offering insight into the experience of disappearing for a month but then coming back--as most truly psychotic people never do when they depart in such an abrupt way. But the book did not offer any insights beyond the perspectives of those surrounding the sick woman, so I was quite disappointed by the effort. It could have been written by anyone of those involved, given the information it contained.I decided to watch the film to see if the director could make a decent dramatization of what transpired. The answer, I am afraid, is: No. Brain on Fire ends up as Lifetime TV channel medical crisis story, where the victim is saved because her parents are so loud and obnoxious that one of the young doctors is driven to seek further help from one of her mentor professors.Susannah was lucky, no doubt. But the lesson here is a bizarre one: Do not believe your doctors, no matter what they say, if you do not like their diagnosis, because there is always a chance that they are wrong? One realistic dramatization was the scene where the protagonist goes to a doctor with her iphone in tow and insists that she has bipolar disorder. The doctor expresses some skepticism, but then proceeds to prescribe her a powerful antipsychotic medication (Olanzapine) anyway! So if anyone has been wondering why nearly a third of Americans are now on psychotropic medication, at least now you have an answer to that question. Note to those unaware of the science here: once people start taking drugs which fiddle with their neurotransmitter reception, their brains change (attempting to compensate by decreasing/increasing receptor density and increasing/decreasing the natural production rate of the neurotransmitter(s) affected). Then when the pseudo-psychiatric patients try to stop taking the drugs, or develop a tolerance to them, they exhibit genuinely psychotic behavior, proving that they needed them all along! Major BigPharma scam underway here. But that¬¥s another story.The message of Brain on Fire is somewhat contradictory: trust doctors, but depend on doctors, since only doctors can save you, even though some will ruin your life along the way, if you are not careful and your parents are not pushy enough and do not have volatile tempers. I am surprised that the doctors depicted in this film did not write the problem off as genetic, given the behavior of the parents, at least as portrayed by Carrie Anne Moss and Richard Armitage.A final complaint: what¬¥s with the lip inflation on Chloe Grace Moretz? Highly distracting. Her upper lip was even a different color from her lower lip! Was this a make up call, or her own vanity-driven quest to look how Hollywood stars are ¬®supposed¬® to look. It actually made me wonder whether her next role (later that day?) might be in a porn flick."
" Sorry, unrealistic
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,3,"I wanted to like it. The movie wanted to be liked. There were just too many unrealistic portrayals and interactions. As Susannah started showing signs of illness, her coworker and even her boyfriend were blind or incredibly dismissive and freaked out instead of showing more of an urgent concern. Parents, too.
The actors portraying the parents showed uneven even a rapid cycling ""bipolar"" expression of emotion.
The script was written as if it were a soap opera.
Ending was simplistic and a sudden. Sadly it felt like a made for TV movie.
The storyline was great and based on true story was impressive.
3 cheers though for the diversity of the cast!!!"
" Mimics My Horrible Experience With Doctors And Fighting CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome)
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,10,"Everyone in chronic pain, with an untreated or diagnosed illness, or a caregiver with someone with untreated medical conditions should watch this movie. This movie shows the struggles someone in America has trying to receive treatment for rare autoimmune disorders. I have been trying to explain the extreme frustration and helplessness one feels when they aren't being listened to by doctors and aren't receiving the treatment they deserve. They always want to blame it on a psychological issue when they can't immediately find a cause. From now on I will just tell any friends or family that care to watch this movie. I couldn't explain it any better. I came down with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) in 2009 after an auto accident. I can empathize with
Susannah Cahalan because CRPS was called causalgia by the Romans, which translates as ""Burning Pain"". My shoulder, neck, and arm felt like I was having boiling oil poured over it. Within 2 weeks I had level 7 pain, and within a year it escalated to a 10 at the worst and a 7 at the best. I was on a fentanyl patch and dilaudid, but it barely helped. I was forced into a spinal fusion 3 years later that didn't work, and the surgeon only gave a 30% chance to work . Even though it was unlikely to help, they required that i ""try it"" or they would discontinue all pain medicine. After surgery my tongue would randomly go completely numb, and the pain spread from my neck, where it started, to my throat. About 6 years after I was injured, i realized that doctors weren't there to help and they wouldn't be able to come up with a diagnosis or treatment for whatever was happening to me. After about 3 months I found what was wrong with me. I was suffering from Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. The second I read the symptoms I knew that was what had been affecting me for over a half decade. I made an appointment with my primary care doctor and went to see her the next day. I thought that she was going to be ecstatic and relieved that I had found what was wrong with me. I was so wrong. Doctors don't like to have a patient that knows more than they do, and they hate having a patient that diagnosis themselves. She left the room to go read up on the condition and then came back to tell me I didn't have it. I was defeated and almost gave up on life that day. I couldn't go though another 6 days with CRPS, let alone 6 years, or the rest of my life. It took another 2 years of begging to get her to refer me to a pain management specialist at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. I thought great, now i'll get help. I was so wrong. The pain doctor at Dartmouth refused to see me until i stopped taking any opioid based pain medications. This was unimaginable to me, because opioids are the only thing that gets me to the next day. How would I stop taking those without something else to fill the void and treat the pain? That wasn't an issue she cared about. She proudly told me that even though she treated the worst pain conditions at Dartmouth she didn't prescribe or see any patients taking opioids, because in her opinion they don't work. They do work when i take them, and her opinion is irrelevant. Granted they only take my pain from a 10 to a 9, but hey, that's a big help. With nothing for pain, i struggle to make it from one minute to the next. With opioids, i have a hard time making it to the next day, but that's better than minute by minute. If you are still here, please go watch this movie right now, and share it with anyone you know dealing with a troubled medical condition. This movie helped me deal with my medical nightmare, and it will help you. May we all someday find a doctor as caring and good as Doctor Souhel Najjar."
" A true story but not entirely true...
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,2,"As an autoimmune encephalitis sufferer, I can attest that this movie doesn't accurately portray any acts that occur in hospitals when attending to patients suffering from this disease.
The doctors and nurses don't show any compassion and don't seem to be taking any steps to diagnose her. I wish this movie had done a better job showing how awesome our medical industry is at attending to patients with mental diseases. Every minute of this movie made me angry at how poorly the medical professions are displayed. I thank God daily for my continued blessings and pray that no one views the medical industry differently after seeing this."
" Excellent movie
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,10,The movie was very educational. Great acting. Great movie.
" Great performances and terrible purpose
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,6,"At first, this movie seemed so promising to me. Everything was intriguing. A person starts to struggle with his mental state, and the acting of Chloe Grace Moretz and the parents of her character was stunning and filled with emotion. It really touched, you know. I could feel the horror of the parents whose child is falling apart and all the cinematography transfers the permanent dazed state so well.
Anyway, this movie is not about this. The further it went, the clearer I could see that the main aim of this film is to encourage people to push the doctors harder and harder if the diagnosis does not suit them. I mean, the number when the pacient loses his life because the patients incorrectly diagnosed his disease is not small, however, those mistakes do not always occur because of the incompetence of medics. Nobody is a 'see-it-all-guy', anyway, in this movie it is concentrated only on doctors' fault. Furthermore, sometimes a mental disorder IS a mental disorder even if parents cannot believe that their beloved child could be 'infected' with it. But this is the true. Let's not forget that even the main character of this movie had a career that could really provoke some severe psychological issues and parents cannot know if their 'little child' does not use any kind of drugs or alcohol. This is the bitter truth that is encouraged to be forgotten while fighting with the system although sometimes the one who is wrong is the one who is fighting with it.
So, why am I giving so much - 6 stars - for this movie? Only for amazing acting and probably for the first half of the movie. Anyway, I warn you: always keep your head cool before shouting that everyone: teachers, docotrs, government - is making mistakes but you."
" A public service must see
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,10,As a physician assistant of 40 years and trained in New York City this movie was done well in terms of the medical underpinnings. All too often medical providers rely so heavily on the testing and not assess the human element and really HEAR the family. Acting above average. Great job. Production awesome. How the critics panned this is an atrocity as it kills the true message.
" The Credibility Factor
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,4,"Whenever I watch a movie, I instinctively use a certain standard that is based on what I call the credibility factor. And this is related to endurance.In some movies, it shows up early, like within the first 5 or 10 minutes. Some take 15 minutes. And typically, that's when I stop watching it. In other movies it takes longer to build, even though there are early indications of its presence. And, if you reach the 30 minute mark, you just might keep watching the movie just to see how bad that gets.This movie is about a serious subject, a disease no one would wish upon anyone. And yet, the abnormal behavior here is so obvious that it's difficult to shrug off. But that's exactly what those who interact with the main character do. They witness the behavior. And ignore it.Now that's not even what constitutes denial, which is a conscious and deliberate choice to avoid painful thoughts or experiences and emotions.These characters do not suffer from denial. Even the psychiatrist can't do the arithmetic. Thus the behavior of the other characters is unnatural, a figment of a conflicted imagination.It's hard to endure 40 minutes of that. It's just not natural."
" It had some flaws but..
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,10,".. I just loved it. Story got me right to the feels, especially because it was based on true story. Thats what movies should be about - the feels and experience that you feel sharing with actors together while watching a masterpiece."
" Does this really show the range of Chloe?
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,8,"I've recently been making my way through Netflix Original Films, and I came across Brain on Fire. The trailer and the name of the movie basically gave the plot away, and I feel that the directing did not fully show the sense that there was something wrong with her brain. If the name of the movie wasn't ""Brain on Fire"", we all would have just thought she was going crazy. I do think it was a great transition within the story. You saw how great her life was... then you saw it all fall apart. This was definitely realistic. Overall, I felt that this didn't really show the range of Chloe's acting, I felt as if it stuck in this crazy mode for a while and scared mode which we've seen from her for a while. I felt that Hick better showed her range, but hey that's just my opinion. It was a great movie, and definitely something that I will watch again."
" Great movie
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,10,This movie does keep you on edge but damn what a great movie. No screamish scenes
" Bringing awareness in a riveting story
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Well written, and top notch acting. I like how the parents, although divorces were a solid team fighting for their daughter's wellbeing."
" Wow!
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,10,My heart broke for this girl in the movie. One of the best movies I have seen in awhile. I can't even imagine going through what she went through. The Doctor is definitely the hero in this film.
" Excellent true story.
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,8,"I don't get the average reviews for this.
An engrossing and, at times, heartwarming film.
Chloe Grace Moretz shows her capabilities as an actress with a terrific performance as Susannah.
Please ignore the naysayers.
This is worth the effort."
" something is missing
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,6,This movie is not good probably because of the horrible acting of some of the actors (mainly the boyfriend) and the fact that for this short period of time a person can't feel an emotional detachment with the characters which in this case is important. Definitely there were good things though - Chloe's acting was good and there was excitement and even slight tension in some scenes. So the movie is not bad for killing time.
" Not Great, But Not Terrible Either
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,6,"BRAIN ON FIRE is based on a book which is based on the true story of a woman suffering from an affliction of the brain, and her experiences with treatment. The film is not as good as I was expecting, but it still delivery some good moments and solid performances nonetheless.I supposed I thought this would be better because of the true story aspect, so I was a little bit let down when it ended up feeling a bit like any other Hollywood film. It's still worth watching though, especially if you're interested in the subject matter. I have not read the book so I cannot speak to it on that level, but I'm guessing the book was better. Recommend to fans of medical dramas."
" Bad Reviews
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,10,"This is a fantastic movie! I believe the young actress who portrayed Susannah Cahalan, Chloe Morentz, did an amazing job. Anyone who didn't give the movie a good review has watched way too many fiction movies. A non-fiction is not supposed to have twists and turns and leave you sitting on the edge of your seat. As for the writer of one of the 1/10 comments.....if you heard a lot of yelling and cursing then you were obviously NOT watching this movie! I give it a 10/10.....and yes - I will watch it again!"
" Great Movie!
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed this movie, for the most part. Definitely shows how difficult diognosing a mental illness can be. My only complaint is that although Chloe Grace Moretz did a great job with the role, I was very distracted by her lip injections. It kind of ruined the movie for me."
" 4 Stars and that is only for bringing awareness
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,4,"What a shame! The movie really deserves 1 or 2 stars. I don't know which is worse, the acting or the direction. The story itself is interesting and it could have done so much better. I don't care to even waste any more time going into further detail. Check out the professional critic reviews - they spell out all that is wrong with this disaster."
" A MUST SEE INSIGHTFUL EDUCATIONAL REALIFE STORY
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,10,"Persistence, patience, compassion & LOVE are inherent miracle cures to yhese unnknown mysterious diseases."
" Absolutely horrible. Somebody owes me 90 minutes back!
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,1,"Horrible acting, boring hour of girl just having a fuzzy head, and nobody knowing why. Waste of time.
Just hated it. Sucks to, cause I like the lead actress alot."
" Best movie I have ever seen!
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,10,"There was nothing about this movie that I did not like! I found the movie very informative! Right after I watched this movie, my husband started experiencing almost the same symptoms! He had not watched the movie but my youngest daughter and I had, so immediately we both thought that he had Brain on Fire! After testing, he has Trigeminal Neuralgia but they did take Brain on Fire into consideration!"
" a heart-hitting story
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,8,"Wow. This movie was amazing. The acting was superb, the story wasn't overdone or drawn out too much. incredibly moving. The beginning was a little repetitive and was a real struggle to get through, but then I think that just emphasises of the struggle portrayed. Knowing it's based off of a true story proves how important this story is."
" Captivated
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,10,"This was the first time I heard of these autoimmune disease, Chloe portrayed the character so well. I was captivated by the whole concept. Can't even imagine going through this ordeal, and how it affected her family as well. I am glad they brought awareness to this disorder and maybe woke up some medical professionals on not to peigon hole symptoms"
" I could literally cry!
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely love this movie, there was this song that her boyfriend made for her and she listened to it in her hospital bed. I know the songs on YouTube but it isn't the version that's in the film :'( I really want this song, it has so many feels and touches my heart! The echo is gives off on his voice is amazing. I wish I could purchase that version :( a lot of people are requesting this as well on YouTube. If you read this please do this, I guarantee you'll have a lot of buyer's with it."
" I'm not feeling it... UPDATE!
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,9,"So somehow the people around her, the boyfriend or parents, couldn't have done more being they could clearly see she wasn't in any shape able to return to work before that important interview?And Tyler Perry being in this didn't help calm my doubts so early in because he can't act, nor that coworker across from her gave me hope that this was going in a realistic direction. She annoyed me, period.But because of the high ratings I didn't stop watching, where the 2nd half of this turned out to be worthy of a 9!Chloe Grace Moretz is truly one of the best up and coming actresses in Hollywood today, where I've since watched her in 'The Miseducation of Cameron Post'.
She wowed me in her role of a young lesbian, and also 'Carrie'.All movies I've only since watched in the past 30 days.I'm just glad to have found an actress worthy of watching today, and glad I read the reviews here before investing time in any film now.Thanks!"
" Not as good as the book
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,5,"Yeah, yeah - it's the old cliche of the movie not being as good as the book. But it's true - the book is so much better. I've read it twice, cried through it, recommended it, praised it for the awareness it brings. The movie is not doing enough - can't pinpoint what exactly is missing - Chloe was good, Carrie-Ann Moss was amazing, however, it somehow is not enough, the recovery path is missing.I wish it was better."
" What a fabb...movie...acting by Chole is above par!!!!
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,10,"One of the very rare movies which acknowledges the Brain disorders
Character, script, acting...all natural and great
Lived it!!!!"
" Very Good True Story
",2018-11-07 00:00:00,8,"I love true stories knowing that whether the ending is happy or sad, it is real. The main actress did a great job! Her acting reminded me of Patty Duke in ""Helen Keller!"" The story moved continually and was interesting. Learning about the medical cause was amazing."
" Don't understand the bad reviews
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,8,"I do understand that the film wasn't amazing. But the story line was great and they played it out very well. I do agree with the people who said the rehabilitation wasn't run on long enough. The point of the film was to draw attention to the symptoms and recognizing it so that people have the chance, like Susannah to make a recovery"
" Underrated film
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,8,I don't understand the bad reviews on this. Some parts of the film could have been better. The first half wasn't always smooth but it took time to get to know Susannah. The film really took off in the second half with it flowing well.
" Get out of my room!
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,8,"This is the true story of reporter Susannah Cahalan who was fortunate enough to be played by Chlo√´ Grace Moretz. Susannah develops a rare brain disorder that doctors had a hard time diagnosing. Most of the film is Chloe acting goofy and then laying in a hospital bed. It is a drama without much action. In spite of being slow moving, I found it still entertaining.Guide: No F-word, sex, or nudity."
" Good Movie
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,5,I really liked Brain on fire. I can't believe that's an real disease. Great acting from Chloe Grace Moretz. She's definitely becoming an great actress. 5/10
" EXCELLENT MOVIE. LOVED IT.
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely excellent......I loved it.....
I just wish it was about half hour longer....
I felt the emotions and I felt the connections.......a few tears fell, at the end...from being overjoyed....."
" This is a movie about how hard it is to diagnose a rare disease
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,10,"In this particular case some girl is acting psychotic and after doing few basic tests doctors conclude that's what this is, she's just plain crazy for unknown reasons. This happens very often for a lot of people and not only in cases where person shows signs of mental illness. At the end of the movie she's diagnosed with autoimmune disease and movie does excellent job in portraying how hard it is to diagnose someone with that. It takes a lot of effort from you, and most importantly people around you who are pushing everyone and doing anything they can think of to try to get some answers. It also makes you wonder how many people could have been saved if doctors put more effort? How many people you know that have some illness but no one can figure what the hell it is? Or maybe you don't such person but you sure will get to know once you get older. Watch this movie to help raise awareness about those issues. This happens every day and it happens more often then you think it does."
" Not bad, give it a chance.
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,8,Brought awareness to the disease. Very sad that this girl in real life went through this. Thank God for the Doctor that actually cared to take a deeper look at her case.
" PLEASE READ THIS.

" Great!!! :)
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,10,"As I always write: I seldom write about films I see,but this one is one of the few golden nuggetts(I'm hungry sorry) I've seen.Watch it and learn something new ... I won't write more about plot, other than it teaches alot about 'quick' depression,schizo or plain depression diagnosis.
Great work for the lead actress, Chlo√´ Grace Moretz."
" Movie worth watching!
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,8,Very good acting & story. It's been a while since we watched it but I'd watch it again. It was that good.
" movie hits deep
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,9,Eye-opening movie in the case of mental health ignorance. Surely a great film. thanks to the makers and the author.
" Brain On Fire feels like a missed opportunity for a medical revelatory drama.
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,5,"Biographical stories should be interesting, conveying an individual's intriguing life with perhaps some elements of fictionalisation. This drama felt almost entirely fictional due to the lack of characterisation and average execution. Although watchable and at times peaked my curiosity, its conclusion came burning down. A film depicting a life-changing month for Susannah Calahan who started to experience seemingly psychotic behaviour that puzzled both herself and professionals. Without divulging the cause of this erratic condition, there was an element of mystery to her behaviour. What caused it? Will she survive? All I desired was reassurance that it wasn't a demonic possession, as I would've thrown the TV remote across the room. This behavioural enigma fades in and out of focus with the inconsistent pacing of the narrative. One scene contained romantic intentions in an attempt to establish emotional investment, the next five minutes illustrated doctors repeatedly confessing ""we don't know what it is, but we shall continue to perform more tests"". Moretz gives a varyingly decent performance, with this role being one of her best. She exhumed competence and confidence although the schizophrenic-like condition was hardly subtle at all, with her being ridiculously happy as she shouts ""I'm happy!"" to then being sad by murmuring ""I'm sad..."". Mediocre execution which may have been better performed by a more experienced actor. Everything about the film is watchable, until the last five minutes. It then chooses to personally attack doctors for perhaps not finding the cause and dismissing her with psychiatric requirements. There are hundreds of uncommon conditions, it is highly improbable for a doctor to acknowledge each one, hence why a professional was called in. Absolutely no need to make this an attack. So aside from the distasteful conclusion and obvious acting, it's a fine biopic that should've been more interesting. Suffice to say, Perry was actually good in a film. Haven't said that since 'Gone Girl'!"
" Made This Burly Man Cry
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,10,"I normally watch Horror films, sometimes a Thriller, and often--with my wife--Childhood Drama. I also write all three in novel and short story form. So, I discovered this film and thought it was another fiction piece; a Thriller, maybe, with some Horror elements. And I was right to an extent, but got so much more in the bargain. This is a true story, and well-directed, fabulously acted, and important. Too bad we don't have affordable social medicine in the good ol' U.S. of A, or maybe so many thousands of others in the same or similar boats would be able to get top quality help. I'll go ahead and throw in that a life lived with a clear conscience and pure thoughts works wonders for the physical health, but it isn't every time that transgression in a life causes physical suffering. Sometimes, yes, and maybe more than sometimes--but not always. In any case, this is a great Drama with Thriller elements and loads of healthy pathos. I like to cry when I feel sad, when I am praying, and when things make me happy. This film made me do or experience all three."
" One of the best performances of the year
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely love this movie. This is probably one of the best emotional performances I've ever seen from Chloe Grace Moretz. One scene in particular really got to me, and that scene was when she thought her stepmother called he a spoiled brat, which she didn't since hearing things is a side effect of phychosis. Susana starts breaking plates and screaming, and when her dad tries to comfort her she starts sobbing and screams ""don't kidnap me."" I think this scene really spoke to me because it seemed so real. This whole movie seemed so real which is what scares me. It proves that your whole life can be flipped at a moments notice."
" Amazing!!
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,10,"Very good performance from Chloe!! I don't understand the bad reviews from the critics but I sincerely enjoyed this movie and knowing it happened to someone in real life it's frightening!!
I'm even gonna go buy the book!"
" Boring
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,3,"Crazy chick does crazy things. Goes to hospital. Doctor fixes her.There, I just saved you an hour and a half. Go watch something interesting instead."
" Wow!! What a story!
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,10,"This is a amazing and honest story about how it can be in the real world. Doctors can also make mistakes. As you can see it can turn in a happy end, if you keep pressure them. The total rating is way to low and as you can see the rating is not always the best way to choose a movie Everyone need te see this amazing movie and learn from it."
" Awful disease exposed in movie
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,6,"Many viewers are giving this film a high rating and are upset if anyone gives a lower rating. They are judging this film on the disease and not the movie. IMDb uses criteria to arrive at a fair value, which in most cases is more accurate. It is not an average of all ratings added together but is based on all ratings made.My rating of 6 for this important movie is very close to this adjusted final rating and thus my thoughts about the movie tallies with this logic. The movie itself is only average, dealing with a very important subject. I am glad to have seen it."
" This movie was a slog fest.
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,1,This film was boring from opening credits to ending credits. If this movie was trying to raise awareness of the disease it did a poor job of getting it's message sent. This movie earned every low score that critics have given it. I have seen more compelling acting and dialogue on episodes of House and Bones. Whenever the actors need to convey emotions they would yell their lines.
" Truly a phenomenal film
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,9,"This is a very interesting movie and for all the people criticising and hating this film, well they are just too dumb to understand it.
Especially when they find out what is wrong with Susannah and then they treat her, it is just an amazing feeling. Also you know this is based on a true story which makes you feel more sympathetic towards Susannah.
I would definitely recommend this movie and also the book."
" Good depiction
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,9,"Great depiction of medical issues, want to read book now..."
" Feels like an extended ad for medication
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,3,"I know the illness is real and the actors put good effort into portraying that, but for those of us without the illness, it doesn't really help us relate, or help us cope with that illness. There are cinematic cues that something more is coming, yet nothing really happens in the grand cinematic scene. If you're a student studying the illness, this is probably better than whatever you get in class. If you're an average citizen, this movie is a bit of a let-down. Would've been much happier to find this in the documentary/drama section."
" I'm so glad they made this movie - hits home very hard
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,10,"Thank goodness for this movie. I went thru the exact same thing except I never got a diagnosis for my condition. I have had seizures at work and one time during a partner meeting at a medical clinic. I also worked for a mental health clinic and ironically I got a written warning because I had several episodes at work. I went thru years of tests with 3 different cardiologists, 2 neurologists, an allergist, an eye doctor, several pcp's, several psychiatrists, several therapists and the easy out was for them to say I just had anxiety, but I know that's not it. Not a single one of them suggested I get tested for encephalitis. And maybe I don't have that, but now I know about it and will get tested for it. I thought the movie was dead on on what someone goes thru when they can't find a reason for someone's condition. It is so frustrating to not know. This movie was well acted and well paced and nailed it when it comes to what family and friends and the patient go thru. Well done and a must see."
" Good outlook on doctors jumping to just diagnose someone
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,6,Overall good Netflix movie to pass time found it pretty interesting
" amazing story
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,8,This movie captures the essence of what it means to have a disorder undiagnosed and having to go to multiple doctors for multiple opinions never trust one doctor very good movie would watch again
" A Decent Adaptation, but a Little Short
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,7,"Let me first note that I read the book before seeing this, so that is an aspect of my review. 
The movie, as it was, probably earned a solid eight. Performances by the cast were I suppose not exceptional, but were up to the task. I particularly enjoyed Carrie-Anne Moss as the mom. The always charming Chlo√´ Grace Moretz turned in a workmanlike performance in an extremely challenging role. 
For those who don't already know it, the movie is based on the true story of Susannah Cahalan and her harrowing journey to find the cause of her mental breakdowns, seizures, hallucinations, and other symptoms, and the challenges her friends, coworkers, boyfriend, and family have of recognizing her illness and finding the right doctor. Once she reaches Doctor Kahn and, through her, Doctor Najjar, it plays like an episode of House as the medical team struggles to determine the root cause of her trouble, which proves to be an extremely rare and nearly unheard of disease.
I only gave the movie a score of seven because, like House, it basically ends at the point where the correct diagnosis was found and really glosses over all the challenges she still faced recovering from it. 
Despite this flaw, it was still well worth the time to watch, and I'd further encourage anyone who has friends or family struggling with unexplained mental illness to not only watch the movie, but read Cahalan's book of the same name. Doctor Najjar's work, in particular, represents the cutting edge of 21st century medicine in this area."
" Just OK
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,5,"While the incident was a rare and fascinating one, I felt that there could have been a lot more depth to the actual script. The acting was well done, but I felt like I learned little about this disease and it truly a fascinating and terrible one.
The bulk of the screen time was devoted to the main character's break with reality and only the last 20 minutes or so was spent from the time she has the biopsy and recovers. Up until the last ten minutes, Susannah was still recovering from surgery.I would have liked to know more about the disease. What causes it? Is it hereditary? How is it related to regular epilepsy. Besides the small bit showing her walking with a can, the Physical therapy process could have been brought in more. Because there were not many peaks and valleys in the storyline it came off pretty flat for me."
" Worth 90 Minutes of Your Life
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,8,"The movie certainly moved more slowly than I would have typically liked, but it somewhat paralleled what I would imagine the family felt, as though that month lasted a year. The acting all around was good. The fact that it was ""based on a true story"", definitely made this a better movie for me. Fascinating that, even in this day, that something that seemed so simple, medically speaking, was not yet on the standard roadmap that doctors take when presented with that set of symptoms. We have so much more to learn and to discover."
" Fascinating and superb acting
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,10,I thought this was a great movie! Especially because it is a true story and they have used Susannah's experience to help thousands more people. Inspiring.
" Bad acting, boring
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,2,Don't waste your time. The acting was bad and the story wasn't very exciting. It's based on a true story but the character exposition did not make me care about the story at all.
" Extremely surprised
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,8,"I was extremely surprised by how much I was touched by this movie. I was diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia back when I was around the same age 20/21 and nobody had any idea of what I was going through with. It might not be so completely debilitating as the disease this movie is based upon but it is still very relatable. Very solid acting performances by everyone, I am surprised this movie didn't get released in theaters."
" A great and thought provoking film
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,8,"I'm confused by the negative reviews some people have written. I get that this film may not be to everyone's liking and I'm sure the book is incredible - but I feel the film really should be more recognised and appreciated. It's such an important subject that more people need to be aware of. I had no idea about the condition or what this poor journalist (and so many other people) have suffered through. The scary part is the many cases that probably went undiagnosed in the past. I thought the acting was top notch and that the story was both frightening and compelling. All the cast stood out in their roles but I found Chloe Grace Moretz and Carrie-Anne Moss truly mesmerising. This film stuck with me for some time after. I have recommended it to a lot of people because it's not just a good film - it's educating everyone about a disease which could so easily be missed because of the symptoms mirroring other issues. Please do give it a chance if you haven't seen it yet. I, personally, thought it was fantastic."
" Great movie! Wish it was longer.
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,8,"I haven't read the book. I was just scrolling through Netflix for the umpteenth time trying to find something good to watch. I watched the trailer, saw a good number of user reviews were positive and decided to give it a chance. It starts off a little slow, but I think it's necessary to show that Susannah was a healthy, young woman living her life. Even so, they don't waste any time to show how her symptoms are starting to appear. Once she gets deeper into her mysterious illness, the movie really picks up. I rolled my eyes at the doctor who clearly heard her say she didn't drink excessively but then told her parents that she was drinking and partying too hard. You really feel what it's like to be on the patient/caregiver's side by seeing what the doctors are not even if it means telling the doctor they're wrong and going elsewhere. I would have rated this ten stars -- the acting, the direction, the writing, everything was on point -- but my only con is I wish it wouldn't have ended with the jump from the diagnosis and the ability to treat to Susannah being almost fully recovered. I wouldn't have minded another 30 minutes if it meant we could've seen the treatment being administered and Susannah learning all her functions again. I wanted to see her transition from being fully catatonic to saying a word for the first time again and then taking her first steps.Even if you don't have personal experience with her revealed illness and even if you haven't read the book, watch the movie. Anyone who faces difficulties either as a patient or caregiver needs to see it. Anyone who isn't currently facing those difficulties needs to see it."
" Great Movie
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,9,I usually don't comment on movies but this movie seems to have made an impact on lot of lives including doctor's. Her Book has actually helped people who has this disease. Great movie. Great acting.
" A powerful and moving film.
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,10,"In having watched this film, it is difficult for me to understand some of the low ratings I have seen. This film drew me in completely from beginnng to end. Having worked in a psychiatric hospital as a pastoral counselor, the aim is to always look for an avenue, any avenue, that will lead a person back to wellness. For many, unfortunately this avenue is never found. This is a hopeful film reminding professionals especially to not give up and keep searching. Knowing the devestation caused by mental illness, it is very uplifting to know the real life individual, superbly played by Chlo√´ Grace Moretz, found her way out of the woods. This is a must see film."
" Such a shame
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,5,"I am so disappointed as I think this film had HUGE potential.Positives: The acting, especially the lead Chloe Grace Moretz, was superb. Her portrayal of a person 'slipping away', from themselves and family, was amazing. This section of the film had me gripped and I was pondering why there was so many negative reviews and low ratings. Which leads me on to:
Negatives: The voice over really annoyed me, and turned the film into a 'made for young people' film, which actually is insulting to young people. It left me feeling the subject was being 'dumbed down', and a waste of talented actors. I cannot stand voice overs when used for telling me,rather than showing me, what is happening. Especially when you have such a telanted lead.
Now my main negative, the ending. It felt hollow and rushed and I felt cheated out of a character that I wanted to know so much more about. Dr. Najjar. He is clearly a fascinating man, and I was left feeling his amazing work was put in a tiny packet, with a little bow on, for us 'dumb viewers'!"
" Refreshingly different and well acted
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,10,"As an almost qualified psyc student my perspective on this film may be somewhat different to others, as it accounted for many of the symptoms we learn about when attempting to understand abnormal psychology. 
Outside that, this film adds something new to the movie industry. It is different from most films and contains all the elements a movie should contain; The relationships between the characters are believable, well emphasised and touching, there is love and there is truth. Most importantly though this film offers awareness. Definitely worth the watch for anyone who has any interest in the area, or someone who is simply looking to enjoy a well acted and interesting story. Overall this surpassed my expectations of anything Netflix typically has to offer."
" Loved it!
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,10,As a person who had an auto immune disease I found this movie very interesting to watch. It was recommended by a Facebook group for autoimmune diseases. The movie moved along at a good pace and the acting was wonderful.
" So relatable!
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,10,"For someone with an autoimmune disease, who went through hell to get the diagnosis, this movie was throughly relatable! The story was told really well - if only more doctors were as thorough as her last dr, we would all be able to live our best lives possible."
" Good acting, okay movie
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,6,The movie was certainly not bad and the acting was pretty on point. My wife read the book and was for sure more into it than me. Anyways the plot is a young woman in her low twenties was doing great in life until something happened with her brain. Slowly she started getting worse and the doctors all thought she was bi-polar or schizophrenic or something but couldn't explain her seizures and such. Luckily she had a great support group and a doctor who cared enough to seek out a different doctor who was an expert in the field and was able to figure out the problem. The main girl did a great job and was the highlight of the film. She really looked lost and stood out. The dad did okay too. Really it should be rated higher but it's just not that entertaining of a story even if it is true. Other people including my wife my disagree but in general I found it average but the acting was better than average.
" give the doctors a break here
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,7,"I've read that the acting is bad in this movie. I don't agree. The parents are great, and Chloe does pretty well with the emoting of mental anguish although it's a fairly thankless assignment. I take some issue with the sense that this is supposed to show us how bad doctors are; by the time she gets to the hospital and is in restraints, I think that an assumption that she might be schizophrenic is honestly a pretty good guess. I'm glad that they found out she was not. But parents' demonization of mental hospitals promoted some medieval idea of them, as if they were a fate worse than death. They are a very bad fit for the chronically misdiagnosed, but the parents were really rude and a bit uninformed about how schizophrenia presents in young adults, which given the fact that they are supposed to be informed people is a bit strange. But maybe that is how it happened (I haven't read the book)."
" One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,10,Chlo√´ Grace Moretz done an outstanding job she made the movie come to life. I alwase knew that Chlo√´ Grace Moretz had a very bright future. She is able to be so natural when acting. She also did an outstanding job in the remake of Carey. I am going to watch brain on fire again and I more than likely will buy this movie on iTunes. Keep it up Chloe
" Cahalan's amazing journey of recovery from a terrible brain disease
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,7,"6/23/18. I read the book a few years ago and did not know they made it into a movie. Obviously, I had to watch it. It was a very good adaptation of the book, which I loved. It was good that Suzanne Cahalan recovered from this terrible brain condition to write about it. She could have wasted away in a psychiatric hospital because the doctors couldn't find anything wrong with her and wrote off her illness as a psychiatric condition. It wasn't until Dr. Najjar came on board, did the biopsy and gave her proper treatment that Cahalan's life turned around. Totally inspirational and worth watching."
" From a Doctor who focuses on a related condition
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,10,"Let me preface by stating I am a doctor who has devoted the last 10 years of my career to a closely related condition called PANDAS/PANS, which produces symptoms like Susannah's but in school-aged children. I know the real Dr. Najjar well and we refer patients to one another.I think the movie must be judged on the public service it provides as much as a work of cinematic art.I think the movie does a good job trying to depict what is happening in the head of Susanna as the disease takes hold. It tries to depict auditory hallucinations and epileptic phenomena, which only a small percentage of viewers have experience with. Just imagine the terror a person walking the busy, noisy streets of Manhattan must experience while experiencing intense auditory and visual hallucinations. The sad truth is, there are many many homeless people in big cities who are experiencing this every day.The particular condition Susannah has is ""rare"", but there are thousands of people with the category of disease to which it belongs - so called ""autoimmune encephalopathy"" (AE). I think the movie shows a sharp contrast between 20th century psychiatry (psychoanalysis, drugs) and 21st century psychiatry, where a few pioneers like Najaar are actually looking for root causes.Just to give you an idea of the importance of this condition, Columbia University Vagelos School of Medicine held a two day conference this past March on AE and PANDAS/PANS. I can tell you that EVERY person with a sudden change in mental status, with no prior history of the same, and no simpler explanation MUST be evaluated for AE and, in children, for PANDAS/PANS.It just might save them for a needless lifetime of visits to the Cuckoo's Nest."
" Exactly the truth
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,10,My daughter at age 15 was finally diagnosed with lupus that was attacking her brain. We went through the exact journey. Sad tears and happy tears. We experienced all the same frustration and then hope and although she has some deficiencies she is almost my same daughter. She was in there and we were determined to find her. And we did. Thanks to one relentless doctor.
" Don't waste your time
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,1,"Just google an article about her case.
Bad acting is when the acting is all too apparent. Of all the bad actors on this film, Thomas Mann, the boyfriend, probably the most forgettably awful. 
Too much yelling, too much cursing, very little substance."
" Good movie
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,9,"I have not read the book so I can't compare but if you haven't read the book, it's a good movie.
I do think that they had to show more about her recovery... but either way, good movie and the acting was amazing!"
" Interesting film
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,5,"Important story. I think it would have been so much better if the sound wasn't so CONTINOUSLY unnerving. It served its purpose having the viewer experience disorientation through her and her loved ones, as the story progresses. But no repreeve, even as the story ends. One of the tinniest sounding films I've listened to. Exhausting. For those with sound sensitivities beware. ( I don't think I've ever felt compelled to leave a review about sound before)"
" A Very Interesting Movie
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,9,"I have to say that I'm surprised by the generally negative reviews this film has received from various sources. It's the true story of Susannah Cahalan, a promising young journalist with the New York Post who suddenly begins to hear voices and experience hallucinations. The movie essentially traces her decline into a basically catatonic state. It's jarring to watch that gradual decline, and you sympathize with those around her (her parents, her boyfriend and her co-workers) as they find themselves lost to understand what was happening to Susannah and as they struggle as various doctors try to diagnose what's wrong with her. Was she an alcoholic? Was she on drugs? Was she just having trouble adjusting to life after college? Those were initial guesses. Then seizures started, and her connection with reality got worse. Was she schizophrenic? Psychotic? Just what was wrong with her?I'd agree with those who suggest that the movie didn't have a lot of depth to it. It's short at about an hour and a half and pretty much goes right into the story. To be honest, though, this didn't need to be turned into a major character study giving us a lot of information about Susannah's life before this happened. We learned enough. She had a happy life, a good relationship and a promising career. That was all established. The fast pace of the movie, to me, actually worked well, because it made the movie seem a bit chaotic at times; it added a sense of bewilderment to what was happening - which really brought us right into the minds of Susannah and those around her. If the viewer was confused - how must they all have felt as this spiralled farther and farther out of control. As a medical mystery and family drama, I thought this worked.I also thought Chloe Grace Moretz did a fantastic job as Susannah. I'm not an actor, but I'm not sure that convincingly portraying someone gradually losing touch with reality would be an easy job. Moretz handled it well in my opinion. It's been interesting to me to read that what was eventually determined to be Susannah's illness (a very rare form of encephalitis) is believed to be responsible for at least some cases of supposed demon possession.I found this a very engaging, fast-paced and interesting movie. (9/10)"
" This Movie Mirrors Our Experience With the Same Disease!
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie has been wrongly criticized for showing clueless doctors. However, this disease was not even identified by the World Health Organization until 2007 and was only named in 2009! My family member has in 2017 been diagnosed with this disease and it was his 47th doctor who diagnosed him!!! Thus, it is important for viewers to know the diagnosis journey depicted in Brain on Fire is REAL and NOT FICTIONAL and COMMON when it portrays how hard in the real world it is for well-known doctors to diagnose this disease so that it can be treated. This movie depicts two important messages: 1. Trust your gut if a doctor says something you disbelieve like ""She must be drinking too much"" or ""She belongs in a mental hospital"" and 2. Keep asking for the views of additional doctors until you get the Dr. House-like Dr. Najjar or his team who figures it out. FYI, Mt. Sinai Hospital researchers are currently conducting a study--independent of this movie but timely!--to report to their profession the high percentage of autoimmune encephalopathy patients who are incorrectly diagnosed with psychological disorders before eventually getting the autoimmune encephalopathy diagnosis and treatment. We recommend this movie especially to anyone interested in the diagnosis process and medical mysteries."
" Worst movie ever
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,1,"Watch an episode of House M.D. instead, wasted 90 minutes of my life. Writing this to help all of you out there to not lose your precious time."
" Well acted, important story!
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,10,From start to finish I was involved in this story. Not much more to say. Just was well acted and beautifully told. Read one review from a critic who said watch out for this movie when the razzies are nominated. Don't know what the hell was wrong with his brain while writing that!? Highly recommended!
" Better than expected (but the book is better)
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,8,"I absolutely loved Susan's memoir (book). I didn't think that any movie could even come close to the amazing piece of writing she produced after having gone through such a traumatic incident. The film was much better than I expected it to be and I commend the staff and crew and everyone else invloved. Let's hope that stories like this educate both the medical and non-medical public that you can't just make judgements or assumptions based on someone's appearances and actions. Sometimes there are no answers, and by accepting this, that is your how our health care system will succeed."
" So close.. yet so far
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,6,"I think it's worth watching, if you're interested in this film. I thought it was okay, while others enjoyed it. I was the only one who read the book. Probably could have been a little longer to build attachment and really see what she went through, I didn't feel the emotional connection as I did with reading her story."
" Very good
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this movie, most of the Actors were spot on, the lead was fantastic, her Father was amazing and just exactly how you'd expect a parent to react to this situation. Her Mother on the other hand, was very calm and void of emotions in most scenes. If that was my Daughters health decreasing so rapidly and no one had answers...I would be frantic and climbing the walls. Definitely not so held together as Carrie-Anne Moss was!
The boyfriend played a passable role.
I like how her boss became more caring toward her, illnesses as serious as this one is, really do make you realize how short life is and how important it is to treat those around you well and with respect and appreciate just how much you've gone through. 
I loved how filled with emotions the Doctor who found her diagnosis was, that's how passionate Doctors should be with helping their patients, big clap of hands for him!!
I do wish her recovery had more airtime than it did as that would have been very interesting and would have altered my rating to a 10.
I would recommend anyone give this a watch!"
" A good watch!
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,8,The movie was great! Gonna read the book now. But felt like they just jumped to the end a bit too quickly.
" House World
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,9,"It's like an episode from Dr. House. The story is good and sad at the same time, definitely intriguing."
" From someone who is bipolar & schizophrenic, this movie clearly deserves a 10
",2018-04-12 00:00:00,10,"I wish there were more movies on the subject of mental illness, the way these incurable illnesses destroys your life, the lives of family, loved ones, and friends.Unlike my life, this movie does have a happy ending. These illnesses are misunderstood, bring fear to many, and in most cases considered Taboo to discuss.Chloe does an amazing performance at portraying the highs (manic) and lows (depressive) of Bipolar. The uncontrollable paranoia, voices and visions associated with schizophrenia. The feelings of being alone, the emptiness and worthlessness.I was first diagnosed in 2010 and have lost my career, respect of my peers, my friends and even lost my 22 year old Son and 21 year old Daughter (they think I am 'crazy', they are ashamed of who I have become, and refuse to educate themselves on this terrible subject). They have now moved two states away and tell everyone that I died in an accident.For those of us afflicted with mental illness... we did not do anything wrong or horrible to be this way. It's just the way we were born. Chemical imbalances in our brain... not from sin, drugs, drinking, or smoking I implore all of you to watch this amazing story that will pull on your heart strings and create a very powerful compassion that you never knew existed.One piece of advice before watching... for many of you, have your tissues ready... I cried my way through every minute."
" better than Lifetime
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,6,"Susannah Cahalan (Chlo√´ Grace Moretz) is 21 with a dream job as a New York Post reporter. Stephen Grywalski is her musician boyfriend. Her father Tom Cahalan (Richard Armitage) and her mother Rhona Nack (Carrie- Anne Moss) are divorced. Fellow reporter Margo (Jenny Slate) is her best friend and Richard (Tyler Perry) is her boss. She starts suffering from strange symptoms but doctors are stymied.The story is basically a medical mystery Lifetime movie. It has superior actors who are able to bring some life to the material. The story is very straight forward with no surprises and the filmmaking is the same. It leaves the movie with limited potential for tension but the actors with the exception of the boyfriend try their best to elevate the material. There is one scene which surprised me. When she looked into the mirror and can't see her reflection, it occurred to me that the first half of the movie could easily be turned into a horror movie. There is a potential to see this from her point of view and make this a paranoia disturbing vision. That could have injected something original into the first half and allow for a surprise twist in the middle. Otherwise, this is solid if somewhat uninspired filmmaking."
" worth to be watched
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,7,"I just finished watching the Movie, which is based on a true Story and to be honest, I love such kind of Movies, because they always remind us that there is still hope no matter how hard life could be become and that we always have to fight forward in order to reach what we want for us, for our children and for our beloved ones."
" the journey of a young journalist with her mental illness
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,8,"at first, i was a bit reluctant to watch this move and when i did ,to be honest, it didn't take me long enough to get the taste of it. if you are a big fan of real-story movies then this is your pick. the move revolves around the life of a young beautiful journalist working in the big city of New York. her life seemed to be pretty much normal. in fact, she had every thing that a young lady of her age could dream of- a job that she loves, and a boyfriend that she adores. suddenly she started to experience strange attacks of headache, so she paid a visit to a doctor in order to cure her suffering. i don't really want to review the entire move as i would like you to enjoy it. so if you have the luxury of a free time, then this is a nice pick for you."
" Got the condition to a T
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,10,"SPOILER: I personally also have AE encephalitis. I also went undiagnosed for many years. To anyone in the past reviews who said it wasn't special, it is. They nailed the hallucinations you get. *hearing and seeing*, the seizures, panic attacks, mania, ocd like symptoms. Everything in this movie was very accurate. Anyone who says it wasn't necessary for making, it was. It's based off the book brain on fire: my month of madness. She was the 217th person ever to be diagnosed with this. We need more awareness. The actors were amazing. Chloe nailed the role and so did the father. The boyfriend was a bit irritating and the beginning is a lil slow but it picks up fast. And when it does, it's like beautiful art. 10/10 would recommend!!"
" Why is everybody yelling?
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,2,"This movie does not do justice to the book or to the diagnostic process or to mental illness and people that suffer from it.I ""like"" how certain users are very opinionated about psychiatry, but completely miss the fact that she saw a neurologist and was admitted in a neurology ward (an epilepsy ward, nonetheless). The fact that her parents refused to admit her to a psychiatric hospital just because they didn't like the idea is just lucky in this case and promotes stigma. To have a certain psychiatric diagnosis first you need to exclude somatic causes (what was done in reality, with all the lab tests and imaging, but it is impossible to exclude everything, as there are a lot of disorders that might present themselves as psychiatric disorders. That does not mean that if you have a psychiatric diagnosis there is always another explanation).She had an autoimmune disorder, which was treated accordingly with corticosteroids, plasmapheresis and immunoglobulin treatment. But before a definitive diagnosis you need to treat the symptoms at hand, and that is done with antipsychotics and mood stabilizers.The acting tries to depict a family in crisis and a psychotic patient, but it fails miserably to capture the emotional tribulation and all the pain that a psychotic episode causes. All the yelling does not do that. If you read the book you can see her boss was very supportive and not at all as he is depicted and her parents were not yelling around the hospital demanding answers. Only two starts, because as I said it does not do justice to the book and just romanticizes the entire thing.You are better off reading the book than watching this."
" Kinda disappointed
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,4,"I read the book before the movie, and I think the path is too slow before the doctor realized what is her problem, it's the 95% of the movie.The recovering process is the fascinating part in the book, I would like to see what she had been through, like she couldn't speak a full sentence, or spoke like a child, and how she got better, not just jumping to she's fully recovered."
" Incredible movie creating awareness!
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,10,"When I looked up this movie at first I was skeptical, due to the reviews on this website..... Boy were they wrong ! This is a hell of a movie, the acting is superb. During this movie I got so angry at the doctors, because this is how that world really works. Not only is it based on actual events, it highlights all that is wrong in the medical world today. The movie is enlightening to say the least. Watch this movie and make up your own mind! Don't always look at reviews, as clearly they can be dead wrong!"
" The rating doesn't Justify the MOVIE!
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,10,"Let me start by stating I gave this movie a 10. OK.. may be got too excited but it doesn't deserve anything less than a 8. The negative comments are beyond my understanding. The story is based on true events. So obviously the end of the movie will depict what happened in reality. But I loved the ending. you have to watch this. The acting done by every one specially Chloe and the Dad was simply amazing. The direction of the movie was great. Gives you something to watch. You stay hooked to this movie till the end. I mean for me i wish the movie was a bit longer. It ended too soon. If I'm not wrong, I think they call it giving depth to the character. And that has been done brilliantly in this movie. No spoilers. But its a much watch. Ignore the negative comments and the low rating. If nothing, I Promise you once your done, u would have learned something new about medical science. But that is just an understatement."
" Some doctors can be wrong - make sure you go to the right one
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,9,A healthy young reporter starts having psychotic episodes and seizures. Initially doctors diagnosed her with psychiatric problems. This movie teaches us to question the diagnoses our doctors give us when they can't give you the answers that you know deep down are right. Many treat symptoms with medication but don't go to the cause. It took a specialist doctor who interestingly in this time of the crisis in the Middle East is of Syrian origin to find the root of the problem which was a relatively newly diagnosed auto immune disease and treat her. After all the struggle with the missed or wrong diagnosis it would have been nice to see the specific treatment she got to get better.Chloe Grace Moretz acts very convincingly throughout the very stages of her illness. I can't think of another actress who could have done it better. She has grown even prettier too. Strange casting of her parents Carrie Anne Moss and Richard Armitage both dark haired - maybe it was like that in real life.Well done - a movie that needs to be seen by many.
" A very good documentary
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,8,"A very good documentary of the life of this girl and her condition. It's not supposed to be cool, fun or even filled with special effects. The actor brings the effects and that is the point with this movie. I liked it and I felt for her. It also gave me a deeper understanding of the condition she's suffering from."
" There's not much to this film.
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,2,There's not much to this film. You are kind of expecting some twist in the end but there isn't. It's quite predictable and frankly there isn't anything that merits making a movie out of this story. We really like films that are based on true stories because it's good to know about things. But this movie was disappointing.
" Fantastic
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,10,"As a person who is really interested in the field of neurology, neuro psychology and all the staff related to brain and cognitive processes, I love the movie. The next step is to read the book of Susannah Cahalan ""Brain on Fire"". By the way, I wonder how can I find the song that Susannah's boyfriend recorded for her while she was hospitalized (can be listened at 0:59:00 in the movie), if anyone knows, help is needed here. Thanks."
" A very good critique
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,7,"I really loved the movie,cause at first you think its just another movie but when you continue seeing it you realized that its a critique to society and doctors,they diagnose you a mental disease instead of run more tests on you ,and that unfortunately really happens so i think that more than one doctor should see this movie and actually learn from it.PS: Chl√∂e was amazing in this movie."
" Difficult brain diagnosis turned into movie
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,7,"A young newspaper writer suffers an unexpected breakdown and this film follows the consequences, medical review, treatment options, meds, etc. It's an interesting story with a somewhat rare root cause, but not that unique considering the exponential learning curve of medical science just in the last 50 years. The screenplay possibly originated in a medical journal.For me, the best part was the insider's view of medical triage: the trials and tribulations of diagnosis, the pressure of expediency, and the effects of advocacy paired with available health care.Suggestions for Chloe Grace Moretz casting/make-up: - the puffy lips were distracting - her nails were too perfect for someone earning a living at a keyboard AND suffering manic episodes."
" Amazing Job
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,9,"The acting was amazing from Chlo√´ Grace Moretz , I thought she was vary believable in her role. The movie itself was inspiring. It was one of those movies you watch, and it felt like your life has been changed in some way. Chlo√´ has been proving herself the be one of the best, and I believe some day she will win an Oscar."
" Formulaic and by-numbers acting
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,5,"So, we have a young journalist working for a prestigious newspaper on the cusp of a great career and seemingly with many great life experiences ahead of her. Sadly, she begins to act erratically and naturally alarms her family, boss, boyfriend, colleagues and even her doctors. As her conditions worsens, we gradually get an accurate diagnosis. Sadly, this part seems too much for Chlole Grace Maretz who plays the young reporter - portraying someone in the throes of rapid mental health decline must be hard, and it seems that she just isn't up to the job. Equally, her parents and colleagues seem to be very slow to catch on to the fact that she is ill, and thus needs help. This is not a bad film, but it fails to grasp the complexities of how mental health issues affect everyone, not just the patient. An average score for an average film."
" Great performance, Turn of the Story Sucks
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,6,"Great performance of Chlo√´ Grace Moretz, she plays a writer struggling with a rare neurological disease. Imo the story (based on an real incident) is a greatly missed opportunity - it would have been a superb movie and performance of Moretz about someone getting psychotic, how one's world falls apart for one who got the mental state of schizophrenia.A weak point of Brain on Fire imo is the underlying message (be it intended or not) that psychiatric illnesses and clinics are somewhat the worst thing that can happen to someone - the movie enforces the stigmata of being mental ill. For schizophrenia, for example, a fast help is essential for reducing the damage a psychotic episode causes on the brain - so in the case of the movie the decision of the parents was (luckily) right not to send the daughter into a psychiatric clinic, but if the case would have turned out that the daughter really had a psychotic episode the damage maybe would have been increased if she didn't get the right treatment.In the end we get this happy ending story (even if it's a true story) which makes the movie a little cheesy - imo this movie could have been a classic if it would have focused on schizophrenia (which in many cases affects the life of the sick for months or years if not the whole life) and would show the consequences (for the ill and his family, friends etc.) of that illness to a greater audience. So the writer gets her treatment and all is good and back to normal - a typical Hollywood feelgood end - I guess people who spend their life in a psychiatric ward or are exhausted by their condition don't write bios.Well, the typical happy ending and my daughter is not mental ill turn of the movie dragged it down to 6, with a more daring story about a serious matter like mental illnesses I would rate Brain on Fire 7 or even 8. Anyway, I enjoyed watching the movie."
" See it
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,9,"Wow. This is a great case that psychiatry is basically a pseudoscience from a prior century, and unfortunately it's still a fallback for medical doctors when they can't explain a neurological problem -- much like in even prior eras when natural phenomenon that were unexplained would be chalked up to supernatural causes. Brain on Fire was nerve wracking and suspenseful. Maybe it wasn't quite as artful as A Beautiful Mind, but the acting was at least good enough and I agree with the other reviews: important subject matter."
" Job Well Done
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,9,"This movie is about a very serious topic. The movie itself isn't all that complicated, but it makes you think about the the whole psychiatric system and all the wrong and serious diagnosis given to various of people, especially young ones. The main actress did a great job. Her name is Chloe Grace Moretz and yes she's just adorable. The movie really surprised me, in a good way, and yes I highly recommend it."
