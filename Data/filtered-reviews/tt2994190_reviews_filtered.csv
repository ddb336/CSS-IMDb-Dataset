" Not a bad message.
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,7,"To my understanding this movie is about a human connection, which despite the unconducive circumstances can and should be made. Kristen Stewart is so young & unsophisticated here, that it makes her portrayal of a naive and innocent character very raw and touching."
" I love this movie, I never tire of it
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,10,Kristen Stewart delivers a raw and emotional performance. You'll never forget this movie. It deserves a 10.
" Sad and passionate...
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,9,"Marked by war, with its scars, pains and consequences, even when there is no more war, what a sad portrait of prisoners of war, who actually represent several of these prisoners, detainees, held accountable in the name of a people, Kristen Stewart very well , is the type of film she knows how to make, only the constant sniffles bothered me..."
" Starts Sad Ends Sad!
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Camp X Ray shows the humanity bond between humans whatever what we did or ended up doing it there is still the feeling of humanity between humans, effective Drama/War movie in a way that makes both of the character suffer for each other, even if someone is your enemy but by understanding and feeling this can change, this is (Petter Sattler)s directional debut written/directed by him i can say this a success for him we should keep an eye on him, I felt (Kristen Stewart) was stressed with the role but she was doing it with (Payman Maadi) both of them got to the point where we can call it top notch, i found some unnecessary scenes that was obviously a no need, i understand that if you are a soldier you are obliged to do what you are supposed to do and also you need to kill your feelings too but every human has a mercy and can feel it, if you are the one that wants to be affected by someone than this is a right choice, highly recommended 8/10‚≠ê"
" Poignant about friendship and power imbalances
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,8,"""Give me Azkaban instead""
""Is that one of the Arab books?""This very first short and amazing conversation between the soldier Amy Cole and the intern Ali Amir starts something heartfelt all lasts all the way to the end.""Camp Xray"" is a complex movie with complex characters. Neither is good or bad, they're just ordinary people in difficult circumstances. Sometimes Amy and Ali are unsympathetic and sometimes they're the absolute opposite. They're human. At all these different times, their reactions are understandable.It can be toxic to be in such a hyper masculine environment as the army. Especially as a woman. Or, in any working place with just male colleges, to be real. It affects us all, man or woman, but as a woman you may face sexism, be distrusted, not be acknowledged like your colleges, and not believed to be able to do your job as good as a man.Kristen Stewart's character faces these things, and she's also conflicted between her army duties and her friendship with Ali, and their slow mutual understanding. There are several power imbalances - the male soldiers have power over Amy, and Amy has power over Ali, by the structures that our society exists by.i love Kristen Stewart, and I think she gets too little credit for her acting. It might not be very variated, but she has a way of acting that is unlike other actors, something I cannot quite put my finger on. Many of her characters suffer in silence, and how she portrays that in this film works so well. She's just so great and convincing as Amy Cole."
" GIGANTIC pile of crap
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,1,"Complete political propaganda, and just a garbage movie all around. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself. I can't say a single good thing about this film, other than it certainly is an unapologetic piece of left-wing propaganda....and a piece of crap."
" Bored story of a friendship
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,3,"The plot is flat and not well developed. In general it is boring, only in the end it becomes a little interesting, although not much"
" Brilliant
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,10,"Captures a moving friendship between two people who should not be friends. A very human moment right near the end made me completely lose it. I am not a fan of Twilight, however, I didn't write Stewart off because of that series. She portrays her character superbly, a mixture of the stoic Marine with a tough yet vulnerable, humane side. The constant war inside is visible on her face, where she struggles with the idea that not everyone in Gitmo is likely guilty, and the even if they are or are not, they are still human and deserve to be treated as such. That maybe America doesnt always get it right. Joining the military, to make a difference and realizing it isn't always 'black and white'. Highly recommend. Brilliant performances by the leads, Stewart and Moaadi."
" The independent film is excellent. A a pair of impressive performances from Kristen Stewart and Peyman Moaadi.
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,9,"Kristen Stewart plays guard Amy Cole, a young marine from a small town who joined the military to escape her life. The movie centers around the conflict of her growing relationship with a prisoner, Moaadi, who has been in Gitmo for eight years.This film affected me very deeply in a way I was not expecting.Kristen Stewart and Peyman Moaadi deliver stunning performances which take your breathe away. You really feel for this guy and Stewart has never been more convincing. I thought it would be a stretch to imagine her as a tough soldier and it is kind of surreal yet she manages to create a credible person out of the role. Her emotional distress as the contradictions of her job as camp guard begin to overwhelm her, is very powerful and a pleasure to watch.The independent film is excellent. It is well written and engaging, as well as caries a great story, tone, and pace with it. A a pair of impressive performances from Kristen Stewart and Peyman Moaadi."
" Better Than Average Pyscho-War Film - Camp X-Ray
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,6,"Life at Camp X-Ray is not life at Club Med. There are two groups of prisoners living here; the inmates and their captors. They both suffer from the same emotional tedium, although the captors have more diversions. I would put this film in the same category as ""A Separation"", ""The Rack"", and even "" The Manchurian Candidate"". The technical aspects of the film are fine, but the acting is a notch above average by Stewart and Moaadi. Moaadi actually gives the more textured performance because of his unpredictability. Director Sattler does a fine job of cutting through the tedium of the daily routine of the jailers and getting to the drama. However, one of the shortcomings of the film is its taboo area; examining why the US does not use due process for some of these prisoners, and why some of the prisoners have such vehement attitudes toward the US. Other than that, this is a fine film worth watching."
" Woaw !
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,8,"Stewart + Maady are awesome in this very very good movie. I enjoyed every minute, every scene, every sound. Be prepared to receive a slap right on your face. That's what it could happen to you at the very end of it."
" Barely scratches the surface of what went on there
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,2,"This movie didn't even begin to scratch the surface of the crimes against humanity that went on in Gitmo.How can you be detained for 8 years without ever being charged with a freaking crime? I personally think 9/11 was false flag and done in-house by the U.S. government that murdered over 3 thousand of it's own citizens to cover up money laundering the likes of Bernie Madolf and other ""Wolves of Wall Street"" coke whoring and flat out stealing american tax payers investments and retirement funds.Then you gotta have a scapegoat/boogie man. Propaganda and lies told by the ""powers that be"" that amp up the people to wage war on people wearing head wraps and flip flops. The thousands of soldiers that went over than and died over lies to support an agenda that basically is that wars generate revenue a last ditch effort to distract the people from an up and coming economy collapse and modern day depression.When the American version of a horror story is told there's always a spin to it making them look like the good guys amidst the horror. Like ""Dances with Wolves"" A story about the indigenous people who were slaughtered and their land stolen, but you always have the one good ""so called white man"" who has the bleeding heart because he knows that its all wrong so that makes everything ok.The depravity and the cruelty these ""detainees"" were subjected to for almost a decade is not displayed here in this movie by a long shot. Though I find Kristen Stewart entertaining as an actor I had to give this movie low rating because of knowing the truth behind it."
" Close
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,10,Great movie and I hope they end that Nazi detention base
" Buon film
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,7,"Non scontato ben recitato, possibilista. Storia delicata e cruda. 7,5"
" Brilliant performances from Payman and Kristen make this highly emotional
",2017-12-22 00:00:00,8,"If you have any doubt regarding Kristen Stewart's acting skills, then this movie will make you rethink your stance. This movie is pulled forward mainly due to the brilliant performances by the two leads.
 I personally believe that the movie has hidden many dark things that happen at gitmo especially the tortures that the detainees have endured including those who were innocent but arrested based on suspicion. So the story does no feel legit. But since it is a movie, i can let that pass. The final moments of the movie were emotional and would bring tears. This movie is really good and is a bit underrated for its story and the performance by the actors."
" Kristen Stewart was made for this role
",2017-11-17 00:00:00,5,"Camp X-Ray (2014) Guantanamo Bay, No easy place to portray. Kristen Stewart shows through her stiff, solemn style, One person makes a difference. Though that may be true, Characters remain distant, Forgettable, slow, Lost potential, I advise fast forward to final scene. (Somonka is a Japanese form of poetry that is essentially two tankas, the second stanza a response to the first. Each stanza follows a 5-7-5-7-7 syllable pattern. Traditionally, each is a love letter. This form usually demands two authors, but it is possible to have a poet take on two personas. My take will be a love letter to a film?) #Somonka #PoemReview"
" What did you learn.
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,4,"Plot spoilers...if you consider the idea the film had a plot.Cole (Kristen Stewart) is a green recruit assigned to Gitmo and is tasked to guard detainees and get much needed acting lessons. They can't be called ""prisoners"" or else they would have POW rights. While there, Cole has a beer, goes out on a boat, complains about her sergeant, and walks around a room, peeking into doors. When she gets to door 105 she converses with prisoner 471 (Peyman Moaadi- A Persian cast as an Arab...who would notice?) who, like Snape, is a complex character and only wants to finish the Harry Potter series. I'm sorry, but that is the whole movie in a nutshell.The film is a look at character and unfortunately it wasn't entertaining. Stewart maintains her dull, lifeless, boring moody character from that first ""Twilight"" film (see DVD cover where she thinks about displaying a different emotion). She was almost as good as that one film where she laid down and played dead.Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Magazine nudity."
" Almost a 10 but focused too much on one detainee
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,9,"As a sadistic atheist I was pleasantly surprised at how much they showed the insanity that religion can do to people. Praying to Jesus, the soldiers can happily abuse in the name of their god or Bush Jr. or Obama who really cares, the point is that then in the name of Allah these brainwashed lunatics screaming day in day out are treated like scum so devoid of humanity that their very will to live is ignored and they are forced to experience boredom to extents you cannot even begin to fathom with no way out of it, not even the most basic most delicate 'never show this in a movie and have it be a casual thing' as SUICIDE!Oh lord, they can't starve themselves, they can't get out if found innocent unless they 'cooperate' AKA say they agree that human rights were not violated and keep their head down like a good little b*** oh deary me this was PERFECTION. So why do I put 9/10 instead of 10/10?I will tell you why, the story revolved around one guy, barely went into the hell he went through and in terms of ""Blondie"" she was as one-dimensional as a heroine can get, like she was literally the character you expect to be the sidekick of a protagonist, she had that Robin vibe about her but where was Batman?Anyway, why I give it 9/10 is because the acting was superb, the storyline was absolutely enthralling you literally could not bet money on what would happen next. You always knew they'd never fall in real physical love and I kind of saw his suicide attempt coming and was surprised it was so late into the movie that occurred but what shocked me the most was the shower scene first but then the fact that she actually let him choose to die or not. If he is nothing more than a wasted animal to the states of America then why not let him die instead of forcing him to live through unfathomable boredom and zero life potential to achieve anything worthwhile?I wish that she had started a real riot, exposed the vile filth of politics and what is done in the name of 'protecting people'. These Americans will talk of Nazis being oh so wrong to do a thing to the Jews... Yeah OK, you are so much better because instead of gassing them against their will you FORCE THEM TO LIVE THROUGH TORTURE and then through YEARS OF NOTHINGNESS AND ISOLATION... I am an anarchist in case you hadn't noticed.I abhor government, it is inherently corrupt and always will be. Brilliant movie, I've always been a Kristen Stewart fan, people undervalue her ability to portray sadness and defeatism through body language because they say it's her only expression. Yeah it's true, she's a one trick pony but damn is she flawless at it."
" Moaadi & Stewart Shine
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,10,"Quite simply put, this movie is a world away from the political grandstanding of utter dross like American Sniper. Instead of attempting to paint a black and white picture of a situation, the film shows it for what it actually is. That is, shades of grey.Having served both within a correctional environment and the military, the interplay between all characters is quite superb, instead of the sensationalist, simplistic garbage one usually expects from the genre.I'll be the first to admit that I was genuinely interested to see how Stewart fared in this film, given the woeful start to her career with the vacuous characters of teen angst she's played and I am happily overjoyed at her rise to actual acting. Her character is multi- faceted, believable and vulnerable.Moaadi gives his role the gravitas it deserves and shows an understanding of his craft that many A-list celebrities could learn from.In short, without spoilers, this is a superb film deserving of so much more that it will get by way of recognition, but suffice to say, I will now reconsider watching movies starring Miss Stewart in the future and look forward to watching more of both Peyman Moaadi and Peter Sattler's works.As a further note to this brilliant movie, to those who think that Kristen Stewart's character is too damaged to be a believable soldier, I suggest watching ""Standard Operating Procedure"" and check out the real life waste-of-space PFC Lynndie England and co. IF she were a character in a movie, I'm fairly confident the self-same armchair generals would bleat and whine about how 'unrealisitic' her character and those of her compatriots were."
" Beautiful
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,10,I Think this movie is beautiful...It shows how ridiculous this war is and how one person can love and respect... The lesson of all is how we should communicate much more and let our believe not rule but our love. It's sad to say that nation army's decide what happen in stead of just listening and appreciating on an other
" One of the best non combat military films I have ever seen
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,9,"Peyman Moaadi and Kristen Stewart give phenomenal performances. The story is well written. This is a really well done case study of the inner turmoil and complicated relationship between detainee and guard. I was sucked in almost immediately and couldn't turn away. The writing, the directing, the acting are all top notch.I probably could have done without the boat scene. It did serve a purpose but not enough that I would have left it in. It kind of seemed almost out of place. Like it belonged in Jarheads.The best compliment I can give a movie is that it left me wanting to go back to the beginning and watch it all again, and I did."
" Where are the torture scenes?
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,5,They backed out of showing the real reason that this camp is famous for because of fear of backlash from the extreme Muslims. The most someone breaks the rules are that they make her watch a prisoner being showered. Disappointing
" Amazing beautiful movie
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,10,"Excellent performances by Stewart and Moaadi, i have never care enough or take the time to ""review"" a movie, but in this case i really had too , this movie was so good and so real wow, at first i thought it would be some US propaganda that they are the good guys but in the end i have no idea who is right or wrong anymore i only know how pointless the War and in this case GITMO is.The movie was totally worth my time and i recommend everyone to watch it."
" A Solid Punch For Kstew Haters
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,10,"Camp Xray is very beautifully acted ,directed ,shoted and composed movie . A story that needed to be told , it reveals the emotional aspect of Detainee and Guard of Guantanamo Bay . Which is indeed a very interesting thing to put on big screen .It does carry a strong message and in present that in a very beautiful emotional way . Kstew always been entitled as emotionless actress , but her recent work has shown us she is a very potential actress , but it all started back then in 2014 with Camp Xray .But real star is Peyman Moaadi, heart-touching performance. Just brilliant.Don't miss this brilliant cinematic flick at any cost ."
" Amazing performance by Stewart and other actors
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,9,"It is a very different kind of movie but it was definitely worth my time. So amazing. It made me cry. You can watch this on Netflix. It is amazing. There is not a lot of action but I think it will be a satisfying watch for all viewers. <3 love compassion humanity humility, I am making 10 lines worth even though I believe my review enough.
