" This movie is just bad
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,1,I hate this movie. This is just bad I have no words to.explain how many mistakes they made. This is an example for how bad new films are. This is just a shame for the other two films.
" A Shameless Insult
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,1,"I have fond memories of the 80s and certain movies were the bedrock of our youth. Ghostbusters was one of them. Ray will always remind me of a younger version of my uncle. It didn't need to be re-done. Are contemporary film producers and script writers so devoid of original ideas that they have to plunder iconic movies for inspiration. Turns out they weren't all that inspired after all as this was one-long, over the top in being politically-correct cringe-fest. These characters were not the Ghostbusters and never will be."
" Hahahahaaaaaaa It Is Funny...
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,2,.... that they keep remaking crap and rebooting and we pay for them. How desperate are we? Have we never heard of going for a run? Or making dinner? All much more fun and rewarding than watching this bulshiiiiiIt used to be that once in a while they would remake a film.. now they start rebooting and remaking and adding sequels as soon as a film makes more than $60. Hollywood: so ready to die a horrible death! PS: not one funny joke/not one woman I am interested in/not one funny situation/just gender politics of hate.
" Why
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,1,Why we have to change the gender of the Characters why can't woman having their own franchisee
" Not that bad
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,8,"My 5 year old (special needs spectrum) is obsessed with Ghostbusters, and we watch a lot of it. Yeah, it's not a classic like the original, but this one is entertaining enough in its own right. The ladies mesh well, and there's plenty of funny commentary between actresses. The cameos are pretty cool too. Definitely worth a watch"
" Truly as bad as they warned me it was
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,1,"I really like Kristen Wig and its hard to believe they had her in this; yet its as bad as it is.
Stale jokes. Forced laughing at their own lame jokes. Ridiculous premises. Poorly written.I felt dirty after seeing this. I felt like I had watched my parents copulate.I have no idea how they managed to get the cameo spots from the originals.
I'd be really pissed if I made the original and saw how badly this attempt butchered it."
" Another political point scoring film that forgets to entertain.
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,1,Just awful. the only reason this film has the score it does is people giving it a ten to push a political narrative. No one could honestly watch this and think it is in the same league as some of the greatest films ever made.
" Unnecessary, Dull and Pointless
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,1,"Why Sony? Why?? I knew that this movie was going to suck from the get-go. The Original Trailer Pissed Me Off and I am glad that I didn't see this movie in theaters. It's an awful attempt at a female cast, mediocre acting, and poorly written, I abhor this disappointing, mediocre, lazy, useless mess of a film"
" The first one had a sexy ravishing brunette
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,3,"As a man I could get horny for.
This one? The 'women' fart into the camera.The rest of the movie was boring, pretentious, far-fetched sexist sob story with a lack of common sense. Typical Hollywood.I really do not understand acclaims and high ratings this movie gets. Did these critics see the film?"
" Nope
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,1,"More care and effort went into writing this review than the script for this film.
That is all."
" The funniest remake ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,10,The funniest star is Chris Hemsworth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
" Gross
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,1,"Why ! Why ! Why ! No one asked or wanted this.
Just rehashing a classic franchise with an all female cast is why it failed. It's not funny at any point. If i could give it minus score i would."
" Seriously? Are There any Adults left in our World?
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,7,"It was funny. Especially if you like the actors which I do. I loved the original, YES, it was awesome. But I think this was well done and I now have it in my collection.For all those giving this a 1-3 because they hate reboots...just stop. The film was funny and definitely a fair 6-7. Just pretend it has not been done before and rate it on that. (Unless you are a guy who hates female comedians then I can't help you) I cannot even come on IMDb for serious ratings anymore.This is exactly why they got rid of the Message Boards. How would they all feel if people gave their favorite movies a 1 because they didn't like what they represent??"
" Pleasantly surprised
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Really don't understand the negativity of some people. This isn't a perfect movie: not all the jokes land, not super original and the female power feels a bit forced. However this movie was really fun and pretty funny.
People have such a hard on for Bill Murray and the originals. Despite a lot of the original characters making cameos here so they must have signed off on it. Get over yourselves people. This isn't an amazing movie but it's not a terrible one either."
" Utter dross
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,1,"Avoid this like the plague, it will put you off the original, Melissa McCarthy is just not funny and the other are even worse. It's embarrassing and cringeworthy that struggles to get a laugh, the only funny thing about it is that someone actually spent money making this rubbish. If you have a couple or hours to spare then go watch some paint dry, funnier than McCarthy and much more worthwhile of your time. This is pure rubbish"
" It's awful.....shouldn't be, but it is.
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,1,"With the cast and director it should be fantastic but the lack of script and willingness of Paul Feig to let the cast improvise and dance all the time make it feel baggy, boring and pointless
Scary moments aren't scary and funny moments are padded out and explained.
In the first Ghostbusters, we had the nerd, the uptight and the kook.
Here we have each of the 3 leads as a mishmash of all 3.
Just an expensive, disappointing mess."
" I'm going ti call the ""real"" Ghostbusters to destroy this movie!!
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,1,"This movie Is the perfect exemple of horrible remake of classics...
I haven't much to say other than this movie Is the worst in the saga.
Very disappointed!"
" Absolutely awful
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,1,One of the worst films I've ever seen. Absolutely embarrassing. What a way to run a timeless franchise into the ground.
" Easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,1,"Masterfully stripping out every millimeter of character development, humour, and intelligence, Ghostbuster (2016) manages to alienate virtually every audience persona in existence. There is literally nothing redeeming about this movie. Nothing. I regret that my friends didn't hold an intervention for me before I foolishly found this abomination and wasted previous minutes of my life. The entire human race is worse off because of this movie, and I am offended on behalf of future generations that they might one day stumble upon this and watch it."
" The Feig touch is real
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,3,"It's been over three years and the actors in this POS still catch shade for this movie? Good. There is such a thing as too much talent in the same movie, and the participants in this obviously counted on someone else in the cast to provide the comedy. It is amazing to me that not one of the stars dragged into this movie managed to produce even a chuckle during it's entire over-inflated runtime.There is no plot to speak of, the majority of the story is just a loose collection of scenes thrown together in a way that ensures maximum product placement but generates zero interest. It's difficult to explain, but everything is just so poorly executed and awkward that it is impossible to watch this without becoming at least a bit annoyed and at worst a bit homicidal.The majority of what is wrong with this train wreck is still on Paul Feig; he is the inept director and hack of a writer who is responsible for this. Also, instead of owning up to the well deserved criticism Paul Feig decided to make this a gender issue; everyone who do not approve of this worthless drivel is a chauvinist and hates women. Nice one, Paul. Thank you for making movies that bomb at the box office, you played yourself."
" For Real?
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,1,"If anyone things this movie deserves better rating then 3 stars, then i am worried for your mental health."
" All that talent, and they ended up with this....
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,1,"Really, there are some talented people in this, just oblivious to the fact this movie was a stinker from the get go.
Again, lets data mine a property from the past and put women in it, without anything else, except, they were putting women in the same roles as the men.
No amount of press, sales job, threats made via the Ouija board could convince people this was a good movie, and yet they persisted in lying to everyone trying to convince them this was a great movie.
It wasn't, avoid this garbage, even if you can check it out from the library for free, there are concussions that are more productive to your day than this."
" Bad film
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,1,"This Ghostbusters Film is literaly the worst ever made.
Ghostbusters 1 and 2 are much bettet.
I hope that the new Ghostbusters will be like the old ones.
I do not recommend this movie to you."
" Re-watched and I think it's really good
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,9,"I watched this in the cinema in 2016 and re-watched again twice since that.This reimagining of Ghostbusters is funny and It's true to the original, but it's novelty supposed to replace it. You can love the originals and like this too.The low reviews (1/10) are completely unnecessary and fuelled by anti-woke campaigners or nerds with fragile male egos.The cast is great, it's funny, I love the effects. I'm a huge ghostbusters fan (have the props and toys etc) and I really liked this reimagining. I'd easily give it 7-10."
" I liked it
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,8,It's not the original but it has funny moments. The story is basically the same as the first. I liked the cameos and the nods to the original. Kate McKinnon made me laugh. It's not as bad as all the reviews. My kids loved it. Worth a watch
" 6.5? Really?
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,1,"How can this movie get a 6.5? This movie were soo aweful, sure I watched like only max 5 min but still : / and why so sexist? Thor dude had like -50 IQ... Annie Potts wasn't stupid, why did they make Thor stupid?
So many questions about this movie..."
" Horrible Movie
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,1,"After watching 2016 Ghostbusters, I totally lost my faith in humanity.
Not because the movie had its abominable trailer with the largest number of YouTube dislikes, even surpassing parodies and twilight.
More so because I had Fresh Certificate on Rotten Tomatoes and took a note above 3.0 here, this is a bad joke.
A film that ends up making a joke about the deceased being well evaluated by any living being, is to cry."
" really bad and I loved oceans 8
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,1,How does this have a 6.5 it's not funny has bad acting bad cgi bad story no likeable characters a stupid wanton running gag and bad acting by Malissa McCarthy who over acts and tries to be funny but really isn't the film drags and really has nothing fun about it anyone who thinks this is a good movie is either a bot paid by Hollywood or must be on dope cause who else would rate this past a 4
" Trash
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,1,"Great cast awful movie 😩
Never should have been made.
What a load of garbage"
" A big waste of time
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,4,"This movie is literally just a by the books, cheesy, unfunny, contrived, and manipulative mess. It's literally just a reboot of the classic film without anything new or unique added. The comedy is truly god awful with some jokes having nothing unique. The worst part of this movie is the villain. I don't think he could be written any lazier. Overall, I think any fan of the original should avoid this one."
" Obnoxious loud annoyance
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,3,"A film about sfx and lfe noises.
Some jokes.The assault on the senses begins straight out of the gate. The story builds from loud to extra extra loud.VFX were good."
" Yay for the woke brigade.
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,1,"How on Earth I stayed the course for this one, is a mystery. What a dismal, awful, shocker of a film, unprofessional, intensely corny, and woefully unoriginal.There is a definite lack of originality, which is quite sad, as a kid I remember seeing the original, I collected the toys etc, it remains a a classic. The cast in that were perfectly chosen and balanced.Ghostbusters 2016 is the polar opposite of the original film, this is unoriginal, tired, unappealing, who on Earth would want any merchandise associated with this.Simply shoehorning in a female lead cast, gender swapping, for the sake of it, is lazy, it's woke, it does nothing for anyone. I am all for female led shows and movies, but please, make them original, don't just do the gender swap, can you imagine if Steel Magnolias was remade with an all male cast, there would rightly be carnage.Why on Earth did Charles Dance appear in this?It's dismal viewing. 1/10."
" I regret watching it
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,2,"Do yourself a favour and don't watch this crap. Feminism is good and all but the extreme side of it ruined this movie. It's so bad that people don't even want to acknowledge it's existence. It is NOT considered Canon. They ruined the wholesome humour that the original movies had through censorship, and they the plot through forced inclusiveness rather than keeping things relevant. It's basically a crappy copy of the first movie. Film production companies should try making films based off of things things haven't already been done because you can't beat perfection."
" Fun Funny Fun!
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,8,"Cast - brilliant
Slime - ew so gooey!
Graphic art - awesome
Opening scene - perfect
Surprise moments - surprising!
Comedy - delightful, with several laugh-out-loud moments
Effects - top notch, with just the right amount of retro kitsch
And the cameos, end credits and soundtrack are just the icing on the cake."
" How is the Overall So High??
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,1,"This movie having a 6.5/10 is a crime against humanity. Unfunny, stupid, and a complete disgrace to the original.
Just scroll through the written reviews! All of the ones I just saw on the first page are 1 - 3 stars. So, how on earth is this as high as a 6.5? Seems like Sony got some bots to cover themselves.
Smh, truly a 1 star movie."
" Don't hate the gender, hate the game.
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,7,"So here's my issue.... I'm tired (as a woman) of LAZY WRITERS changing the genders of people and thinking that is enough to make women not notice that, as always, female characters are so often one-dimensional and tropey.We deserve better. I want to see more women in movies... I'm tired of how many leading men I see. But I also won't just settle for just anything.Including my gender isn't a game of money. Please for the love of GOD just give us some more representation that isn't forced. As a child who loved Ghostbusters... I deserved better. And so did you. That being said... A lot of far more terrible movies have received higher ratings from people. So don't be angry because a bad movie stars women (note this movie was written and directed by a man). Just WANT MORE from Hollywood. I know I do."
" The cast is an indicator
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,3,"In short: Didn't like it. But what would you expect from this cast? 3 out of 4 main characters are mostly know for their appearance in SNL, where they're great! But it's another kind of acting than in a movie. Seeing over the top characters goofing around and making strange faces, while all talking at the same time for 2 hours is simply too much.
The only real movie actor is Hemsworth, who got a totally useless role. Seems like men around female heroes have to be excessively mean or dumb or weak or a combination of all of this. Why? It doesn't make the main characters more likeable or look smarter.
If you call the movie Ghostbusters and unsuccessfully try to copy the old movie as much as possible, people are of course going to compare both movies. And the 2016 version doesn't look good in comparison."
" Ignore the guys ganging up on this movie.
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,8,"The insecure, backwards thinking people banding together to downvote this movie are pathetic. Low reviews come in around the same time, use the same phrases, and upvote each other. Ignore those!
Here's a normal person to tell you that this movie is good. The four lead ladies are terrific. The supporting actors and cameos are great. The original Ghostbusters is good too! You know what, guys?! It's OKAY to like both!"
" Capitalism and Studio greed for more money strike again
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,2,"No need to describe how bad this reboot movie is & the rating is a fraud. It should be 2/10, but the studio's adevrt team boosted it.
Capitalism and reboots are junkies and make sure women are not allowed to be thin and show skin."
" Antagonistic
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,1,"Not funny, extreme antagonistic form of feminism and identify politics."
" Just plain generically bad, nothing more.
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,4,"This is certainly an interesting specimen to study when it comes to the powers and limits of marketing.While there were certainly some, let's put it diplomatically, passionate comments being made about a female-led ghostbusters reboot by a select group of people which in turn saw a less than well thought out marketing campaign in response, audiences' overall reaction to this film seems to have been dispassionate indifference, which is probably the most appropriate one.Going in with an open mind and not actually being much of a ghostbusters fan myself it's rather obvious this is just a generic bad mid-2010s comedy and nothing more. No reason to get upset about it either way,This was clearly just cobbled together from hours of improv with very little thought being put in before filming. It also has the same large problem that is endemic in a lot of current comedy, namely all characters being too wacky and too self-aware that they are in a comedy. The only two actors who were playing it more straight, and seemed to be trying were Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones.Comedy is actually really hard to pull off and it's always a lot of work. Just because you had a great time laughing and joking on set doesn't mean the audience is going to feel the same way. Comedy also needs layers and juxtaposition. Making all characters loud and annoying and adding fart jokes is not enough.
Paul Feig had a lot of prime real estate here, especially with Kristen Wiig who is both a terrific dramatic and comedic actress, but used virtually none of it. I don't even want to get into the cameos by the original cast. Those were just saddening...In general I think I'm just tired of reboots and remakes, whether I'm invested in a franchise or not. Anything with a recognizable brand name eventually gets the same treatment.I'll always be up for a genuine intelligent re-imagination of a franchise, especially when you turn a modern feminist eye on long established questionable tropes and roles in the media. That is really way overdue, but unfortunately the ghostbusters reboot did none of that, in fact it may have temporarily sabotaged that cause by Sony blatantly trying to woke-wash it after the bad response to the initial trailer.
Even if this had all been planned as a clever deconstruction of sorts, which clearly it wasn't, why choose ghostbusters of all franchises? They aren't really macho action movies filled with sexist stereotypes.
Why not a female James Bond, Ethan Hunt or John McClane instead? That would be something worth watching and rallying behind."
" Maybe not the worst but my least favorite movie of all time
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,3,I will make it short it is mostly our fault more than it's Hollywood's we are going to the theaters to see remakes since it started to be a trend we encouraged Hollywood to make more remakes and even more money so they keep making them because we are giving them money i know it's not a review but i wanted to share my opinion
" What a mess!
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,1,"I saw a trailer which appealed and I noted the 6.6 rating, so I watched it. What a mistake. I cannot, immediately, think of a worse film. Not funny and not worth watching"
" Ghostbusters
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst films I have seen in my life, CGI. The movie is worse than the old movie. The characters are very bad. The movie is a comedy failure. Hollywood should stop making remake of its old films. I would not recommend it to my enemies to watch it."
" A very sad excuse of a remake
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,2,"It seems like the movie tries to be funny, but the jokes are incredibly lame and not funny at all. Too much pointless talking without any good scenes to follow up anything whatsoever, a movie without a script.
Everything is bad about this movie, don't waste your time and watch the original from 1984 instead.
Ghostboredom!"
" total 💩💩💩
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,1,"Piss poor acting,crap actors,why did they even bother,got to one of the worst ever made 💩"
" Completely misunderstands what work with the originals.
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,2,"First of all let me start by saying i really have no problem with the idea of an all female ghostbusters team. If the comedy is on point and the story engaging then I'm in.... unfortunately this is in no way the case with the 2016 ghostbusters reboot.
At times it feels like the makers and stars of this movie have simply misunderstood the appeal of the original movies, at others it feels as though they are actively trying to stick their middle finger up to what came before... The comedy style is nothing like the style used in the previous movies and frankly it just isn't funny and the cast appear to just be phoning it in... a soulless imitation of the original Ghostbusters that has non of the charm and non of the humour. Very dissapointing"
" Figured I'd give it a second chance....
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,5,After seeing it initially when it came out and hating it I figured I'd give it a second chance. I thought maybe my love of the original might have biased me to this newer version. WRONG. This movie is every big the disaster I thought it was. I lay the full blame for this on the writer and director. The girls who are known for their comedy background came off stupid in most cases. Then there was the dumbass character that Hemsworth played. Yikes.
" People where definitely hired to boost this movie's rating.
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,1,"Everything about this movie sucks! I don't even have enough passion to continue this review. If you want a better way to spend 2 hours, try drilling a spike into your stomach and bleed out slowly instead."
" Review from a normal person
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,8,"I remember vaguely watching the original as a child but basically saw this movie fresh minded with no expectations.
I thought it was a pretty great film! I really liked the 4 main actresses and they bounced off each other well. The film was light-hearted and really fun to watch! The cgi was really well done, and actually quite beautiful during the big ending scene.
Personally I think this would've done really well as a TV/streaming series, as we would get to explore more fleshed out characters, the premise of the show definitely allows for it. I hear there's a number 2 movie coming out and I'm looking forward to it.I'm sure if this was a movie wasn't being compared to the original (which has such a big die hard fan base), there wouldn't be so many negative reviews. Unfortunately that's what you've got to expect when revisiting classics."
" 6.6 average rating? Is this a joke?
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,1,"Horrible acting
Horrible script
Horrible movieGiving this movie an average rating of 6.6 stars is 5 stars too generous!"
" How does this get 6.6 ???
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,3,I'm gobsmacked at the rating for this is absolutely AWFUL and not a laugh In site. Incredible a complete dishonour to the original. They even wrecked slimer lol good luck laughing
" Hoop bloop shoop!!
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,1,King Kong went to hong Kong and ate a ding dong chong !!!!!!!
" Oh god...
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,1,I thought there might be some mild entertainment still here and was ready to enjoy it but this is unwatchable. An abomination.
" Once again going against the crowd: it's not bad.
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,7,"Yes I grew up in the 80s and loved the original movies. Yes this is yet another reboot and I'm getting tired of those. Yes, there is nothing exceptional here. That being said, it is still a pretty fun and entertaining movie in my opinion, and while the plot, writing, and directing are nothing to rave about, I thought the cast did a great job and showed great chemistry. Very enjoyable and fun for what it is so hate me for it if you must but I had a good time watching it!"
" No need for Hemsworth
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,6,A funny film and a decent remake but this Hemsworth cannot act.
" This has already been swept under the rug.
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,2,"The original Ghostbusters and it's sequel are really enjoyable classic action comedy movies with expertly crafted scripts full of memorable and quotable dialogue and dry, sarcastic humor. The way the characters speak and act makes them feel like real people who all have their own distinct personalities.
The effects are great and still look good (mostly) nowadays because they are mostly practical.The remake replaces all of that with a bare bones script full of wacky slapstick and people falling over. You can tell they just rolled the camera and let the actors improv and then edited the ""best"" bits together. It isn't funny and mostly consists of them being ""zany"" and awkward or screaming like banshees.
The effects are not terrible but it looks very cartoony like it was aimed at small children even though it clearly isn't.People dislike this movie not because the Ghostbusters are female but because it's a bad movie. It's already being forgotten as another movie is out next year starring the original cast (it will probably be awful though).Bill Murray has a cameo and he looks like he wants to die."
" You should be ashamed
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,1,This movie humiliates itself and the original one.You can just change the story...or the characters because you want to support womans.DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE
" Chicks ruined it
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,4,Boring plot. This movie is not worth your time. Chicks ruined it. Chicks ruined it.
" HORRORIBLE
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,1,"The Woke generation decided to take a classic and destroy it. Even the computer graphics were terrible. Kate McKinnon IS NOT funny. She gets a pass from the critics because of her persuasion. Wiig is the most talented of all of them and she was wasted. This is a case of, Shouldn't have done it."
" Meaningless, unfunny cash grab.
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,1,"While I may not have nostalgic memories attached to the original, this movie was a massive disappointment. I loved the first film and enjoyed the second one too, I found them funny in a smart way; the comedy in this film contributes nothing in the story and is just put there to get a cheap chuckle from the audience, plus, the jokes are incongruous with the situation, nobody would act the way these people do when faced with what they are faced in the movie. This movie is just the original story without the charm, humour and decent effects; this new movie is all tell, no show and doesn't trust it's audience one single bit. I hope Ghostbusters: Afterlife is better and brings something new to the table."
" Hilarious!
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,8,"An awesome all girl-centered Ghostbusters! This Ghostbusters caught my attention more than the original ones, so I didn't compare it much. The acting and jokes were on point along with the fun action. It was a blast from beginning to end with different twists and turns. The ghost parts were very creative and interesting. One of my favorite aspects of this reboot was Chris Hemsworth. He was so funny and a surprise to see him being comedic.
I say give it a try for the fun of it and the great acting!"
" Forced and boring
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,HellyWeird feminazi(sm) in movies doesn't pass. Learn that movie makers!
" Unfunny comedy
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,1,"A comedy movie and I didn't even chuckle once. Unoriginal, unfunny and a sad waste of talent. Should be less than a 5 on IMDb and I would have given a 3 (some good effects) but gave a 1 because some company shills are giving ridiculous high scores."
" A Call Not Worth Answering
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,3,"Ghostbusters (2016) is written and directed by Paul Feig, and stars Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wigg, Kate McKinnon and Lesile Jones. Now back in 2016 when the film was first revealed it was met with severe backlash from many folks around the internet. There was criticism for the film being a reboot, rather than trying to continue the series with the original characters (even though as we know Harold Ramis has sadly passed on); however much of the complaints centred around the role reversing of character's genders as well as the film appearing to look largely unfunny. Now although I find the concept of gender-swapping to be a cheap way to cash in/appeal to woke PC culture when it's done lazily, it's not something that affects my viewing experience, and I harboured no ill will towards this movie. It's also not a property I had a lot of attachment to anyways.With that out of the way, Ghostbusters (2016) is now 4 years out post-release, and I figured I'd sit down and watch it since I had failed to see it that summer in 2016. What was nice was, I was able to view this movie without any preconceived notion in regards to the toxic backlash this film faced. However by the time the credits started rolling I was left with a feeling of mediocrity, as the film seemed to lack inspiration outside of its all women's Ghostbusters concept.Before delving into my criticisms towards the film, I'll first start by saying that I have been a fan of some of Paul Feig's previous works, film's like The Heat and Bridesmaids, prove that Feig is more than capable of creating a decent comedy. On top of that, the ensemble of McCarthy, Wiig, McKinnon and Jones, are all pretty funny individuals who have each excelled at bringing humorous characters to life, however here I found many of the jokes to be mostly unfunny. In fact, Chris Hemsworth (who plays the secretary in this version) is probably the funniest part of this movie for all about 4 minutes, as the one-dimensional character he plays, Kevin, sort of gets old after a short time, as the character's stupidity can only take the comedic effect so far. Outside of a lot of the jokes falling flat, the film seems to get wrapped up in its heavy-handed social commentary; from the villain being a white incel in his late 20's referencing most of the suspects involved who carry out domestic terrorist acts, to the protagonist's in the movie bashing their critics, in a way that tries to poke fun at individuals complaining about the reboot. Angles like this could have been accomplished in a tasteful and clever manner, however whenever the film acts as if it has something to say it fails miserably.In addition, I found the film to be sloppily edited, with many scenes abruptly ending, to sequences that feel as if they jump all over the places. Similar to the editing, I didn't find the story to be all that hot. I found the film had trouble setting the universe's rule as far as how to defeat the spirits, this was pretty evident during the film's climax wherein the Ghostbusters are taking on a mob of ghosts and they're attacking them as if they are zombies; when earlier in the film the crew was trapping ghosts as a means to contain/defeat the aggressor, similar to the original.Overall I don't have a ton of positive things to say about Ghostbusters (2016), from the choppy editing, CGI slog-fest of an ending and unfunny comedic bits, it just amounts to a very dismal film. Which is a shame, as this could've been something pretty decent given the filmmakers involved. If they had just taken more time to work out the film's kinks throughout the process of making this movie, audience's would have probably been treated to a better film, I mean they basically had 25 years to perfect a new Ghostbusters movie and they somehow failed. It's definitely not the worst film ever made, in fact, I have seen people praise the film, which is all well and good, but knowing the talent involved, it's very disappointing to see what could have been somewhat of a decent film, reduced to forgotten rubbish. I should iterate that this is just my opinion, and if you did find enjoyment in the film then all the power to you, but I just can't recommend this film to anyone who happened to miss it, as I did, and for that reason, I'm giving Ghostbusters (2016) a 3/10"
" Bad
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,1,"This is horrible feminist garbage just leave classics like ghostbusters alone, would you Hollywood"
" CGI oops
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,10,"In watching Ghostbusters (2016), for the hundredth time with my son, I noticed a CGI flub. When Holtzman's character throws the ghost trap at the concert, watch her ghost gun. Orange flame is gone for part of it but Kate McKinnon is acting as though she has a flame. Oops."
" Far funnier than given credit
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,10,"Think people took this the wrong way, If you watch the unedited version, the in jokes are hilarious and don't compare it too original because it's a separate stand alone and I personally found it far funnier than the original...... All actors in this were very good and it's a shame people compared it with the original. I hope in time this film becomes a cult classic in its own right once the sensitive public chill out. Well done guys..... I am a fan x"
" Haters gonna Hate
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,9,"Man the people giving this movie a 1 star rating really need to watch more movie so they can truly grasp what an awful movie is. If this movie is 1 star the what is The Room, -12 stars? This move was well acted, had a coherent plot, well shot, decent graphics, and was really funny. Who gives a movie like that 1 star? They should be tied to a chair and forced to watch every god awful movie from Manos: Hands of Fate(1966) up to Cats(2019) to give them some perspective."
" I loved it!
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,10,Just because people don't like that they changed the genders of the main characters I believe is the only reason this didn't do well. All these actors are amazing and did a great job. I love the original Ghostbusters and love this one as well.
" It does positive things but there are certainly negatives
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,6,"First things first, the following is worth noting: I have no attachment to the 1984 film, nor do I particularly like it; I rated it and its sequel 5*. I'm not saying it's overrated or anything, I just personally don't enjoy it that's all.With that said, I'd class 2016's 'Ghostbusters' better than the original. However, as you tell by my rating, that's not me saying this is a good film. I don't believe it is. It's incredibly slow paced, with a very forgettable and untidy plot. It felt longer than a 116 minute run time, that's for sure.It's not all bad, though. I actually rate the casting. Melissa McCarthy can be hit-and-miss, but this is one of her more solid performances. Kristen Wiig, great in 'Bridesmaids' alongside McCarthy, is a decent performer too. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon are alright, while Chris Hemsworth is pretty amusing.I, despite not being a fan of it, still enjoyed the callbacks to the '84 film; as well as the use of the superb theme song. As for the special effects, they look good but none of the ghosts stick in my memory; both visually, but also in terms of the story. It would've been nice to have a standout ghost. Likewise with the film's villain, who is ridiculously plain.In conclusion, it does positive things but there are certainly negatives. All in all, I think the latter just outweighs the former unfortunately. 6*."
" Scraping The bottom of the franchise barrel
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,3,"At least this proves that Chris Hemsworth is a hack and anyone who watches anymore (so-called) Ghostbusters needs to take a hard look in the mirror.
Why is it prohibited for women to be pretty, alluring and kind?"
" This film is an embarrassment.
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,1,Everyone involved with this film should be ashamed and leave Hollywood and just work at McDonalds. If you like this movie you should probably just walk off a cliff because you contribute nothing important to life.
" A 2-hour turd.
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,1,"How did this loser rack up a 6.5 rating on imdb?Given a great many people understand this is one of the unfunniest ""comedies"" ever made, how could it have pulled down the many 9s and 10s necessary to balancing them out and getting a respectable rating? Are that many people blindly political, or is it just that there's no longer much discernment in comedy audiences?Or is imdb rigging the game? Metacritic, which doesn't tinker with the raw numbers, has a user rating of 2.8 out of 10, with thousands reporting in. The chances imdb would honestly come by a user rating, then, of 6.5, is statistically insignificant. What's going on, imdb?Even the trailers couldn't come up with one funny line or sequence or pratfall. Not even one. At least we won't have a sequel inflicted on us. Congratulations to Paul Feig for costing the studio $70 million. Let's hope they learned a little something."
" Not at all funny
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,1,I don't think I could cringe any harder. This was dreadful.
" Remakes Do Need to be Refreshed!
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,6,"This is an entertaining enough and dare I say it, family - friendly version of the original Ghostbusters. I liked the 4 woman team and found the Kristen Wiig character, especially appealing. Chris Hemsworth didn't disappoint either with his amusing support role. It's really sad that there is a largely male element of the movie-going public that is misogynistic and carried out an extremely toxic anti-female campaign against the movie.My main problem with Ghostbusters is that the plot is much too similar to the original. So Ghostbusters 2016 is virtually the same as Ghostbusters 1984, except it has gender-swapped characters, rejigged dialogue and predictably, jacked up special effects scenes. Fair to add that it suffers from the lack of a Bill Murray type character, continually dropping those droll one-liners that he excels in delivering.Take the example of The Magnificent Seven sequel, which also came out in 2016. Yes, it has the structure and feel of the original, but the Seven are quite different the second time around. The Mexican village becomes an American town and there is a strong female character added. Too many of the 2016 Ghostbuster scenes seemed to be extrapolated straight from the original movie, with New York again being the central location of the storyline.Director Paul Feig has a great record creating films with strong female characters, but I'm not sure he was the bloke to be helming a near $150 million effects - driven blockbuster, which lacked a great deal of the snappy dialogue, usually associated with his movies. Ghostbusters ends up being, an overly respectful, somewhat bland homage to the 1984 original. Further evidence I'm sure, to strengthen the truism of letting originals stand alone, unless they can genuinely be improved upon, by adopting a completely fresh take of the material."
" Could have been good..... instead was bad
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,1,"Everything about this was poor and stiltedThe banter between the characters, the storyline, the hackneyed jokes, everything was just terrible.Wiig and McCarthy are normally brilliant but they both look uncomfortable here, maybe it's the godawful support from Jones and McKinnon who both do their utmost to drag this movie even lower on the scaleThis movie without McKinnon and Jones? 3/10With? 1/10"
" Skip it
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,1,It's rare that I can't finish a film all the way through. This was one of those occasions. It's not humorous in the least and is just bad all the way around.
" Fricking amazing better than the original bc its women and we love women
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,10,I am a feminist I prefer having the male receptionist because he is objectified just like women to be honest i think all men should just be oppressed bc of what happened 30 years ago i love women i think all women are super cool i love women
" The Prequel to The New Charlie's Angels
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,3,"First, this is not a good movie. Second it killed off the name 'Ghostbusters.'. It's cheesy, and the action isn't done very well. The girls are not eye candy. Most of the comedy does not land."
" HILARIOUS 😂
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,10,"I have to be honest, the first time I watched it I switched it off about 20 minutes in to it. I was a huge fan of the original series and couldn't get over the new changes made with an all female cast. This is now my go to movie, the girls are awesome and funny. Give it a go. It's actually really really 😁 funny.
I feel like we're so stuck in our ways and never ready to open up to new things.
That's all. Try it again and open your hearts."
" Feminazis busters
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,1,Worst thing ever made and F### bill murry for selling out to apease feminazis.
" Hilarious
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,9,"This movie is hilarious. The jokes per minute ratio is very high, and for a non-american the portrait of New York is endearing and kind of nostalgic. It feels like a classical movie, with real soul and humor. Even the special effects are beautifully vintage, and even if some of the acting is over the top the end result is that of a modern cult movie. I love it!"
" Disgusting
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,1,Why must be the female version for every art of men's piece?
" Led Balloon
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,4,"I wanted to like it... despite my nostalgia for the originals I was determined to go in with an open mind and give it a chance but unfortunately the movie was a bit of a led balloon.
I've liked other work by director Paul Feig and the likes of Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth is usually a safe bet.
For me the comedy just falls flat. I thought the idea of an all female Ghostbusters team wasn't too bad actually. Maybe the filmmakers were trying a bit too hard to make this work.
It did bag the studio just under $230 million at the box office off a reported $144 million budget so it wasn't a complete car wreck but although there's a scene after the credits setting up a sequel I wouldn't bet your house on it happening anytime soon."
" AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,1,"One of the WORST films I have ever seen in my life. Horrendous in EVERY way!!!Dreadful casting, wooden acting, frustrating story, appalling product placement, annoying screaming throughout, shoddy soundtrack, bad editing I could go on and on and on and on..."
" Wtf
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,3,Why bother. The originals were brilliant this is not needed
" 2 hours of my life i will never get back. What a waste of time.
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,1,"Probably the worst remake ever. Why do they do this?
are they totally ........ ,
God, I know what they will do next!!!! Charlies Angels with 3 guys."
" Did anyone ask for this? Cause I sure didn't
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,2,Why does Hollywood keep a failed franchise going after it's been sucked bone dry? Simple. MONEY. it's a complete waste of time that can often feel more offensive than funny. Recommendation? Don't bother. You have much more valuable time than to see this
" Misunderstanding the source material
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,2,"This movie is just garbage. The original was a real movie with elements of comedy. This is just a slapstick mess with poor cgi reminiscent of a ps2 cut scene. I have to wonder if this lot remade independence day would that be slapstick? It had the same balance of action and comedy!The film's ending looks and feels more like pixels 2 than a ghostbusters movie. The poor review is nothing to do with feminism- I usually love Melissa McCarthy films, it's down to poor quality of writing and execution. The only reason that I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it had one single moment of brilliance with the 'handgun/lasso sequence. In short watch the cannon ghostbusters movies and forget this one exists."
" Re-watching
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,7,"I rewatched it 4 years after it came out and all the hate was already forgotten. Of course, as an 80ies child the original Ghostbusters is still number one for me, but to be fair: it's actually not that bad once you see it as a complete standalone film, with the eyes of someone who doesnt know the original. my kids, who have not seen the original actually enjoyed it and laughed a lot.Guess as a parent I have to face the fact that I just got old and movies I loved as a child are not loved by younger generations that much ... We, the older ones, have to accept that times change and that younger generations just have other things they may like, we may stick to our favorite ones but also let new versions come for other generations without hate. Just because it's not my taste and just because the original will always be in my heart doesn't mean that new things are that bad. That's why I changed my original rating from 4 to 7."
" Worst of worst
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,1,"Stop ruining my old childhood movies like this.. this real madness needed to stop .why you want to gender swap movie like this ???
Just stop"
" Literally AWFUL.
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,1,"I've never actually said this, but this movie is without a doubt tithe movie that tried the hardest to be funny of anything I've ever watched. And I can say that not ONCE did I laugh out loud, not even close. The humor was what you'd expect a group of 13 year olds to come up with. The main jokester one that has the butch hair, her whole role feels as if it was written to say ""look! Girls can be gross and funny too! Look, fart jokes haha, look she eats a lot ...""It was in every way from the opening to the ending, to the race of the characters...a shameless copy of the original, but worse in every single way. I've been to funerals that were more funny, and no...it wasn't scary either.Why was Hemsworth in this film...? Oh! Because he's very good looking, so let's make the super it guy play a total dummy...ha..ha...so funny.""The power of Patty compels you!""... really...? A film writer wrote this line...? And why are the two big women yelling every line they have??If this was meant to be proof that women can carry a film like men... good job, you made women look way less talented. Way less funny, way less original.Shooting the giant ghost in the balls...? How funny. Yeah, that's not 12 year old humor at all. If only it had a queef joke...OH WAIT..IT DOES...What a total train wreck.Leslie Jones: zero talent racistKate McKinna: funny, just NOT HEREKristen Wig: Good actress, not hereMelissa McCarthy: Female Adam Sandler, but less funnyPossibly the only moving where a 1 star was deserved."
" Great for Kids: Gateway flick to 80s Classics
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,6,"So as an adult who grew up on the originals I was super disappointed with this film. It was brighter colored, faster, the characters quirky but unrealistic and unfortunately since I was sooo biased I judged it way harder than I would of had it been an original flick and not based off of an treasured favorite. Having said that I have a 3 yr old I began introducing to classics last yr. He would get bored whenever I put on Ghostbusters 1 or 2, he couldn't pay attention. My brother in law gave us this one and it totally grabbed his attention. He LOVES it and asks to watch it all the time! My friends kids do too, I see kids on youtube and such loving it. Now I can get him to watch the older ones and he likes em alright but still loves this one. It was lighter and catered to him more. So after having seen it 20 times it has grown on me, though I still wouldnt seek it out. It is a great gateway to 80s movies. Start with this and lead them into other stuff. 6 of of 10."
" Better than ghostbusters II
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,7,"I'm a massive fan of Ghostbusters. Its a movie from childhood that I've lost count of the number of times I've watched it and can repeat all the lines.
This reboot isn't as good but I really enjoyed it as do my three daughters. We've lost count of the number of times we've seen it now and it always makes me laugh. Give it a go, its better than ghostbusters II!"
" I now know how they paid for this remake
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,4,"Wont even go into the film I think enough reviews state about what I felt about the whole movie the only thing that I want to say is
I have never seen so many blantant brand placements in a movie ever!I wont go into them all after the Pringles, papa Johns and Heineken I gave up counting
my feelings are if you have to get that much money for sticking brands in a movie maybe you shouldnt make it."
" Great effort
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,9,Loved this film Chris was brilliant so where the female cast. I looked forward to this and I loved it. Great plot great effects and great ending. I am not being sarcastic I loved this movie.
" Does anyone remember this?
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,3,"The film lacks the least density, there's nothing to make us believe the story. We're faced with a barrage of nonsense and bad jokes, starting shortly after the characters are introduced at the beginning of the film. The only thing that can be saved is Kristen Wiig and her complicity in some scenes with Melissa McCarthy. Otherwise, it's all clowning and characters that don't shine at all even if they try hard. I'm not comparing it to the old one, I'm valuing the film itself.3/10"
" Terrible
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,1,"Don't waste your time, go rent the original movies."
" Weak
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,1,Not silly and underlying preachy vibe. The first two eclipse this one
" Hilarious take on the original which is a vast improvement
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,9,"I really don't understand the mean spirited, negative reviews some people have given this movie. I can't help feeling the negative reviews are misogynistic in origin rather than a true reflection the movie content.
I thought it was refreshingly funny and a vast improvement on the original. It's a shame there's no sequel in the works."
" One Of The Better Remakes In The World!
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,8,"Overall, I really enjoyed the original Ghostbusters and it is in my top 10 favorite movies of all time. However, I didn't really like Ghostbusters and while before I watched it I knew it wouldn't be as good as the first one so I just wanted a good time but I didn't really get that much. It is not the worst thing I ever saw but it was still a disapointment to me. I was a little nervous before watching the film but I was happy to see that film was actually fun and enjoyable. Is it better than the original: No, but to me it is better than Ghostbusters 2 but overall, I had a very fun time with this film."
" It's ok but it could of been good.
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,3,They had the potential to make a very good film but they casted Andy Garcia and that did it in for this film.
" Oh my!
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,2,"It's Tom Hank! ""Safety lights are for dudes"" is the funniest line in it. What was the original cast thinking when they decided to cameo in this garbage."
" Ghostflopsters
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,4,"Was really looking forward to film. Could not believe a film with all the money possible to make could be such a disappointment. A film that is un floppable flopped and the terrible comedy aargh, was lucky to get 4*.that was only cos my friend laughed once or twice"
" Horrible
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,1,"This is how not to write a Ghostbusters movie. Too bad this cast couldn't have been in a good Ghostbusters movie, they really are talented, and that talent was wasted in this film."
" Shockingly terrible.
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,1,"This movie is terrible for all ages. The dialogue is needlessly silly & tropy; the jokes & gags fall flat; the characters are witless & flimsy; the cast does not mesh in any way; and, there are nonsensical elements slathered all over to hide the step for step rip-off of the original storyline.I'm going to loose my lunch.I had to watch"
" If you want an easy watch with the family this is a good choice
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,8,"Not amazing but not awful. I thought it was easy to watch, fun and entertaining. I think with all the hype people expected too much. Take this as it is Ghostbusters with an amazing woman as Ghostbusters. I liked the cast, liked the movie and I'd definitely watch a second one if they decided to bring one out."
" Disrespectful
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,3,"For those, who really like the franchise, are going to feel like this movie is completely disrespectful. They tried to make a comedy, with a bad screenplay, to fade the fact that this movie is disorganized. The idea failed."
" Probably my favourite film
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,9,"Firstly: the extended edition features some GLORIOUSLY awkward acting from Kristen Wiig but also trades out some excellent lines for alternatives ones, so I recommend seeing both.Secondly: this film is just so much FUN. Kate McKinnon absolutely ROCKS IT as Jillian Holtzmann, Chris Hemsworth DEFINES the word ""himbo"", there's some awesome new weapons, the team are likeable... it was just amazing to go back into the cinema and experience a PROPER Ghostbusters film, with the special effects and everything, on the big screen. Since then I've bought a couple of DVD versions and watched them a whole lot of times. If I ever need something fun and guaranteed to make me smile, it always does the trick.Full disclosure: I'm a biiiig Ghostbusters fan; I love the movies, the cartoons, the comics. If you don't get excited by proton packs and ghost traps, probably not the film for you."
" Yuck
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,1,Just Yuck. Everyone involved just took a little wee on the originals
" Escapism fun!
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,"I really don't get what the negativity around this movie is. We have been in the age of reboots for the last decade and a half - the well of fresh ideas have run out! I thought it was funny, well cast, although I found the Hemsworth character unrelateable. The cameo's could have had some more humour but otherwise escapist fun!"
" One out of ten is still to high a rating for this ""movie""
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,1,"If it were just another bad movie, a 1 out of ten would be generous but fair, but seeing as they had a template from a near perfect movie, copied it beat for beat and still managed to make such an unwatchable hatchet job out of it merits a -5 just sheer incompetence.This movie simply should not exist."
" Needless retread
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,3,"I was pretty sure I was going to dislike this film before I'd even seen it, due to it being a cynical ""girl power"" effort that seems to be geared to the politically correct crowd and woe be tide any man who dares criticize it. But all that aside, what we have here is a needless retread of the original film, with a pretty much identical plot, but none of the charm or subtle humour that made the original so great. The gags aren't funny, there are hardly any new ideas brought to the table and I think throughout the entire thing I laughed twice. Maybe. Even the special effects are not that much better than the original, and considering the original is 34 years old that's saying something. When director Paul Feig goes on a rant blasting the fans for not being able to accept females as the leads in a Ghostbusters film when in fact most criticisms were levelled at the film being, well... a bit rubbish - I feel that says it all..."
" Improv Night
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,1,"I didn't care for this movie because it seemed to focus more on the comedic talents of the actors than any sort of story or plot. The actors weren't acting to further a greater arc, they were just doing schtick, and unless you share their sense of humor, you likely won't be entertained by it."
" Really cool.
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,9,"A very pleasant piece of comedy science fantasy adventure with rich characters and a great plotIt's a charming tale of old friends reuniting to pursue the passion they once shared.I like that it has female characters that actually have personalities. They're clearly all very smart but rather than fall into Hermione Granger Syndrome they are just as prone to reckless behavior or even blatantly think with their clitorises.The only gender flipped thing so far to really work because it would have been made anyway.Solid friday night entertainment,."
" Don't watch
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,1,"Simply just don't watch this movie lol.
not that hard to just not watch it"
" Ghostbusters VS Ghostbusters
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,10,"I love the Ghostbusters i spent a lot of my childhood watching it and when I found out that another one was going to come out with females it made me smile. The main problem people really have if the cast are not male. People can not look past the fact that they are looking at females to see that the movie is good and funny! The only parts i did not like is having to watch Chris Hemsworth dace and show off. As a dumb guy that cant do anything right thats funny but the other parts no that was what made me roll my eyes. So I want people to stop dissing this movie just because they have boobs, take a look at the movie for what it is and what it is is good and funny!"
" Hemsworth is so useless
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,3,"It is not that good! It was not fun to watch. Should be rated 3/10
I don't understand what this movie gets so many 10/10 reviews!! it was torture watching it and none of the women was pretty in this movie."
" Blind hate won't make film companies think

I don't like remakes, specially from good movies.I don't like when studios try to cash in at my expenseBut, c'mon, the idiotic, blind and sexist attack on this movie and the cast it's appalling.
I didn't faint from laughing, but it wasn't that bad. And i did smile a lot on different scenes.
The female cast did an ok job, not great, but ok.I'm tired to see a lot of idiots who think a 1/10 star is a statement. 90% of the reviews do not relate with the quality of the movie."
" Reasons To not Watch
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,3,"No women flaunting their slender bodies and being pretty. Women in baggy outfits.Insults, jeers and misandry.Farting disgusting fartingA man licking boots and being humiliatedyet.another.gender.flip."
" New take on Ghostbusters and that's not a bad thing
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,10,"Hey all you kids that saw the original GB movie in your childhood(like me), this movie wasn't for us, it's for the kids that weren't alive back then. It's Ghostbusters for the kids of today! And that's an awesome thing! This movie is fun and funny, sure it may not be everyone's taste in humour, but not every movie is! So I don't understand all the hate it's getting.
It's okay to like a remake and still love the original! I know I do, the new take on ghostbusters was refreshing and quirky and I loved the exploration of friendships. (With cool science!)
If this movie was really just for the SJW's why didn't they let the Leslie Jones (Patty) be a scientist??"
" Just a failed attempt at something good.
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,1,"Just by calling it Ghostbusters doen't make it a good movie.. actors were not utalised correcctly, poor script.
Nothing to do with an all female cast just a poorly exceuted movie plain and simple.. don't waste your time."
" Yup. I get it now.
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,10,"I love the original Ghostbusters. It was a lot of fun.Why does a different vision mean it is a hit to men everywhere? Is this another thing like NASCAR? A woman driver is an allowance, and a novelty? Like the one black driver you have, in 2020?Is that what it took for you to denounce the flag of traitors?This film has been seen through cloudy eyes. Shame on you."
" I liked it
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed the film. Perhaps I wouldn't if I read all these negative reviews before hand, but with an open mind, it passed the time nicely with a few good laughs.
Decent casting I thought.
It's Ghostbusters, what's not to love"
" The genius of this stunning motion picture
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,10,"Most people may dislike Ghostbusters 2016. Those people are wrooong! But to be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Ghostbusters 2016. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the finest in current day politics, most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's headThere's also Patty's simplistic outlook, which is tightly woven into her characterisation-her personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnyan Volya literature, for example. True fans understand this stuff: They have the intellectual capacity to appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny-they say something deep about LIFE!The haters really are idiots-of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in such an existential catchphrase ""That one came from the front"" which itself is a cryptic, intricately coded reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their chimpanzee heads in confusion as Leslie Jones' wit unfolds on their theater and television screens. What fools! How I pity them all..."
" I tried.....seriously, I tried!
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,1,"I waited for the hype and nonsense to die down and watched on a free preview weekend to see this and make up my own mind.
Unfortunately, it was just a badly written movie with very low brow humor wih, nothing more than a chuckle, if you were lucky, ripped off script from original Ghostbusters 1984 and characters with 1 dimensions, maybe 1/2.
I had no problems with the gender reversals, but for God sakes, write your own script and don't just copy the original. Don't reboot, just remake and do your own take on the Ghostbusters. The gender reversals also dumbed down the characters. The original secretary was smart and snarky. Hemsworth just played a guy they hired cuz he was so hot, but had an IQ of 10. Why? Cuz its so darned funny!! Yawn....
The only way you watched this movie and came away with a good feeling was if you didn't go to it, you would have had to watch 10 straight hours of Jersey Shore. And I probably wouldn't have minded that!
For all its political and gender blah blah, this is just a bad movie. Paul Fieg really missed the mark on this on. Now I know why the reviews and box office returns were so poor! Get it....Poor!
Final review, bleh!"

" Not as bad as people say
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,7,"The original Ghostbusters is my #2 favorite movie all time. I was outraged like many when they announced a female reboot. I just wasn't a fan of the female comedians they picked. Would way rather have seen Amy Poehler and Tina Fey or something. But the movie is surprisingly really funny. But unfortunately, it's not very spooky (in fact pretty hokey) and the plot is a pretty generic rehash. I did love the new Ghostbusting weapons they came up with. But overall a pretty average effort but also with skyhigh expectations to live up to."
" Wow. Just...yikes.
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,1,"So I made it thirty-three minutes before I bailed. That should entitle me to some sort of award.It wasn't 33 minutes without a laugh, though. Well, it was that; but I mean it wasn't only that. It was 33 minutes without a chuckle, or even a snort. In fact, it was literally 33 minutes without even a smile.There were some winces. It was as if all the creative (?) minds involved said, ""We have better special effects, we have performers people like - what do we need with a decent script, funny dialogue, disciplined performances, and actual humor? Are you kidding? We'll just make it up as we go along!""I made a mistake letting the good rating at Rotten Tomatoes overcome my reluctance. (I should have noticed how much lower the audience score was.)But at least I got out before Leslie Jones really got going."
" Wiig and McKinnon shine, McCarthy turns it to merde
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,2,"Given that the makers were so hell-bent on providing a movie of ""opposites,"" it seems rather apt that the two non-actors - comediennes Wiig and McKinnon - sparkly in this movie, whilst the purported professional actor (in her own mind; I'm sure no others) McCarthy continues her streak of turning everything she comes into contact with into a steaming pile.Yes, McCarthy managed to get a few laughs out of me - but probably not in the context she'd have been hoping; they were all of the ""WTF were they thinking"" variety, with a few ""look at that idiot"" turns thrown in. I'd for a long time been thinking that the only role suitable for her was as Miss Piggy in a live-motion Muppets interpretation, but looking more closely I've no doubt she'd screw even that up (she certainly managed to drag down to failure the otherwise-brilliant Happytime Murders, after all).I've already made a note to keep well away from Feig's future escapades - if he can screw a franchise like Ghostbusters up so completely, there's no telling what he'd be capable of making lesser stories smell like."
" Insulting film
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,1,"People should be more offended by this movie. Leslie Jones is a funny actor who was put into a stereotypical loud sassy black New Yorker role. All the women in the movie are good, all the male characters are either inept or out to get the female characters. This movie isn't about the equality they preach about when promoting and defending it. The special effects are on par with the Scooby Doo movies from fifteen years earlier. The jokes and dialog seem phoned in, like being able to smell isotope decay off a random piece of trash in a subway tunnel. The whole production should apologize for this film, and for setting back racial and feminist progress back twenty years."
" Maybe I'm from another planet
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,10,"Steered clear of this movie because everyone said it is bad. (And there I was thinking I should be old enough to know better :) )Anyways, I have just learned that Kate Mckinnon is playing this movie, so obviously I had to give it a shot, since I will love her to death till the very end of my mortal existence, whatever role she takes her fancy to try on.Okay, so came with the attitude of anything goes, and oh boy, this was one of the funniest movies I had experienced in a while. And it gets harder and harder to please yours truly closing on the 40th mark.Everyone gave a solid performance and for a light entertaining movie which takes its own interpretation of the Ghostbusters story, it was pretty well written. (Seriously, I expected way less)And yeah. Chris Hemsworth. Do I need to say more? No. You know I don't.Oh, I had no idea about the cameos, they were just pure delight.So anyway, lesson learned hopefully for real this time. Gotta check it out, then decide, let the sheep do what the sheep do, and you my friend: form your own opinion.I would say this is a solid 7/10, but since so many are hatin' I'd just threw in some extra, because balance must be kept in the universe. (I mean, this is pretty much will be a f*rt in the wind, but for that one person who might stumble upon this review I can wholeheartedly say: hey... at least I tried :). Go watch it and have a laugh. Life's too short for hatin'.)Adam"
" I knew this was going to be bad
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,1,"So rather than subjecting myself to the entire movie and having my memories of the original ""Ghostbusters"" film destroyed, I watched the Cinema Sins review of it instead. Even that was depressing!Fine, movie. You want to have women in the hero (heroine, actually) role. This is a great example of how not to do it.This movie is nothing more than a repeat of the original. Except without the jokes. And with a lot of political correctness thrown in.No thanks. I'm glad I didn't pay to watch it."
" Terrible
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,1,Should've never been made. This movie has regressed all of the progress that was made towards womens rights. This is a comedy? They tried to make women funny and it absolutely doesn't work they should've left the original alone and never made a sequel
" Great Movie
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,8,"I loved this movie. It brought back nostalgia from the first original and added new graphics to it. The humor was good, loved Kate McKinnon's character, and the fact that Chris Hemsworth agreed to play a doofus tops the cake. The fact that they brought the ghost from logo to life and made him mad was awesome. I felt like this movie deserves more than 3 stars based on the fact that its a fun, updated version of the first Ghostbusters. Nobody can replace the original but that doesn't mean they can't make a version of that original."
" Easter Egg Fest
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,5,"It could've been a good movie, but instead they depended on the extreme use of Easter Eggs and Cameos, and cheap punchlines.
The characters were not interesting, not even funny, just delivering punchlines after punchlines with no connection at all.
McKinnen and Hemsworth which are actually two actors that I enjoy, just had two of the most annoyings characters ever. Not funny at all.
This was indeed a bad movie, the only fun was the easter eggs and the cameos, and the soundtrack was okay too."
" Way to butcher a classic
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,1,This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Total garbage. All of the sets look like theme park attractions. The acting is atrocious. I feel dumber for having watched it.
" Worst movie

" Totally Changed My Mind.....
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,10,"I originally gave this 1 star...I was wrong. I've watched it again and I get it..I thought it was trying to be Ghostbusters 3...it's not, it's really not, it's really, really not. It's a new stand alone Ghostbusters 1 for the new generation, that's what I was missing. Looking at it with that revelation, it's brilliant, it truly is. So enjoy it for what it is a 2016 Ghostbusters movie."
" Garbage...
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,1,"This is by far the worst movie, right next to Catwoman.Avoid like the black plague!"
" To all the haters
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,8,I'm in my 50s so was brought up on Ghostbusters. Absolutely loved it and still brings back great memories but I don't understand why lots hate this movie to the point of poisonous hate mail sent to the cast. I think this movie was entertaining and funny. A different perspective but still had the same offbeat humour. No it wasn't the same awesome experience I remember as a kid but as a stand alone movie highly entertaining. It seems odd that America can handle something's but not females in great roles. Seems every new female remake on movies is hated with venom maybe because you don't want a female President. Who knows? For those of us outside the States it doesn't make sense. I know my review is going to bring heat but seriously it is a good entertaining movie and just see it as such.
" Holly mother of god.
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,1,"No words will suffice.
So, so bad. So cliche. So lame. So unoriginal and not just because it's a remake. Instead of empowering women as seems to be the trend in Hollywood these days, it's doing the opposite. So cringeworthy."
" What a Waste!
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,3,"This film is utter waste of opportunity with its source material and talented cast. Although all main actors shared good chemistry between them, but the writing is so bland. All the witty dialogue, colourful characters and the suspense from the original movie has been all taken out, and replaced with racial stereotypes, sexism and fart jokes."
" The worst movie I've ever seen
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,1,"Horribly unfunny jokes, characters that never shut up, a remake too🙄 of one of the best comedies of all time reduced to a sewage turd. This never should have been made it also plays out exactly like the original except in the old one it's funny and reserved but here no one will shut up constant do you remember this movie jokes and action scenes cause the ghostbuster definitely were hero's.... this should be buried in a time capsule to teach the next generation how not to make a good movie"
" Don't waste your time.

" Fresh and original

" Watch the outtakes!
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,7,"This movie is really not that bad. I took it as a bit of light entertainment and you know what - I was entertained!
Okay some of the jokes weren't that funny but there are sooo many worse movies out there that get higher scores than this. These women are so talented and funny and if you watch the outtakes on the dvd you'll see what I mean. Some of those scenes that didn't make it into the movie were HILARIOUS. Such a shame that they didn't put those scenes in!Also the movie is worth watching for Kate Mckinnon alone. She is so funny, has amazing comedic timing and energy, some of her lines (and outfits!) I thought were totally iconic! And I ended up falling a little bit in love with her by the end.I understand people's criticisms and I agree that the female ghostbusters could have better, but the fact that there IS a female ghostbusters is amazing in itself and should be celebrated. I for one am proud that the industry and Paul Feig decided to get behind this project and I don't regret buying the DVD at all. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie if you want a giggle and to be entertained."
" No need to say Boo
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"This wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it wasn't amazing. I could tell they were at least trying to make something good. Having the film open with the classic ""Ghostbusters"" theme music was a strong choice that worked in the film's favor. It took me a while to warm up to Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy's characters, because for the first half, they were just loudmouthed and annoying. But after a while, that stopped and I actually enjoyed their performances. That is one of the weaknesses of the film is the first half isn't very strong. There was a funny joke, and then they would immediately follow it up with an unfunny joke. Also the CGI in the movie made this year somehow looks worse than the effects of the 1984 version. How?! One thing I will say about the film was it at least had a sense of irony and meta. There's a part in the movie after they catch their first ghost and upload the video of it where they read comments and one says ""Ain't no women going to hunt no ghosts."", an obvious jab at the mysogonistic backlash some people gave this film after the first trailer was released. At least Sony was cool about it. There's a running joke throughout the film where McCarthy's character orders food but there's always something wrong with it. This was unfunny and slowed the film down, and overall just wasted time. It's not painfully unfunny, it just falls flat. I said the first half was filled with unfunny jokes, but when Chris Hemsworth enters the picture, his performance makes up for it. He's one of the best parts of the film. He totally hams it up and I could tell he was having fun with it. Some of the original cast members make cameos and while they are funny, they just distract. I was worried how this movie would be, because of how horrible the advertisements were, but surprisingly, it's very respectful of the original. Even the new versions of the theme music, both in score form, and the one by Fall Out Boy still feel like the orginal. Even though this won't be an iconic film like the original, they were at least trying. Overall, the film is like food from Jack-in-the-Box. Not horrible, but still pretty good.Grade: B 8/10 3.5/5 stars"
" Is There A Role Any Role Chris Hemsworth Will Say No To?
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,2,"He appears in any trash and for any role.One star seems harsh,so I will give it a two. We were watching it together in the conference room. The characters are annoying and the plot is very predictable. I never enjoyed a film that little since watching Mamma Mia, and yeah this is an unpopular opinion but well, I have it.
How about we allow women to have self respect and be fit?"
" Nope

It makes a few welcome nods to the original movies but this is the kind of movie that thinks that sexual harassment in the workplace is funny, as long as the victim is a man."
" Omg!!!!
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,1,This movie sucks from the first scene. I wish I could say something good about this film but there isn't anything good to say. It comes across as forced comedy. It has all been done before nothing new here to see. Just a bad idea that turned into a bad movie.
" A poor day time film
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,2,"First time I've ever seen this it suffers from a stupid story, poor pacing, awful acting, horrible humour and dismal directing. Don't watch this unless you are temporarily unemployed with no money, self isolating from Covid-19, your internet has stopped working and the only channel that works has this playing. Chris Hemsworth is funny though so a star for that."
" Utter garbage and I'm being kind!
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,1,"Sorry, but this is simply a sequel too far.Its obvious that the main ""big name"" stars were skint when approached to do this. Why else would they be involved in this dross."

",2020-03-09 00:00:00,2,"Right, let's dispense with all this talk of political correctness are arbitrary gender-swaps - they just muddy the waters.Apart from two genuinely funny jokes right at the start of the movie, all the other jokes are annoyingly unfunny. They're annoying because their setups require leaps of logic that don't make sense, and maybe it's my pedantry, but I started counting how many times logic was elbowed aside in the name of ultimately mediocre jokes; it happens a lot. It became irritatingly distracting. Add to that, that you've got jokes - obviously improvised jokes - that lasted way too long and which, on the whole, fell flat, and you start to see why I was quite so irked.The writers, Paul Feig and Katie Dippold, also plainly think that, in order for these characters to be funny, they've all got to be stupid. For heaven's sake! These are supposed to be clever people, but they're not. With the exception of Kate McKinnon's Holtzman, everyone is unbelievably stupid.Talking of Kate McKinnon - bless her heart - she tries so hard to keep this film watchable. I could practically see the strain on her face. It's McKinnon that made me smile most whilst watching this, for which, she deserves a medal. It's her and her alone that kept me watching this otherwise irredeemably terrible movie."
" Oh no
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,1,"I can't understand how a somehow decent director and decent actors can make this.
Having one of the greatest source materials of all time, great financial resources, the posibility to have the majority of the original cast... and making these.
It just doesn't make sense. Just please stop doing things like this. Let other people do original movies, i don't know. Just please stop this."

",2020-02-26 00:00:00,4,"This movie would have been a hit if Leslie Jones wouldn't have been cast as one of the Ghostbusters. She added absolutely nothing but classless remarks in the movie and I found her extremely irritating. Hopefully if they film a part 2 she will not be part of the cast.Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy rocked and had a lot of chemistry."
" Unbelievable
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,1,"Wow, that mus be the worst attempt to a reboot ever. The original was funny but in a sophisticated way. Not over the top shove it in your face comedy. It was well written. Look at the elevator scene, and you know what I mean.
This one was just embarrassing. It's a replacable slap stick comedy for the brain dead. It's just sad and it really hurts to see how they screwed up a legacy."
" Doesn't deserve the hate, but still not a good movie, nor a bad one.
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,4,"I'm going to get 1 thing clear the 1984 ghostbusters is my favorite movie of all time, and seeing it getting rebooted was weird, then when I saw who the cast is and I was like, alright this is interesting, let's give it a shot..... Then the first trailer came out, and the trailers was so terrible everybody started hating on this movie, but there was a little bit of hate before the trailer came out, and those people were sexist, they hated it because it's an all female cast. But in reality, the trailer wasn't telling you how good the movie is, because the final product is not bad at all, I was 11 when this movie came out, and I was like wow this movie doesn't deserve the hate it gotten, but it didn't do so well at the box office and if the trailers were better than what they were, this movie would've done a lot better.
Did it meet my expectations though.... no, I'm gonna be honest I was pretending that the trailers didn't exists, so I came in with high expectations, and that's sad because I wanted this movie to be a lot better. Paul Feig is such a talented director, I knew he had the potential to make this movie amazing. Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wigg, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones are such talented actors, yet there were few moments where the acting was kind of poor. There some funny jokes in the movie, but a chunk of them did not land. Also, one of the main problems with this film is that the pacing was off, but we got the flaws out of the way, let's get on to the good stuff. I loved the action in this film, it was so fun and badass to watch. First act was kinda poor then the second act was better, then the third act, I absolutely adore the third act in this film. Everybody was complaining about the CGI in this film for some reason, I thought the CGI was beautiful to look at. I thought the soundtrack in this movie was amazing, it really fits in with the tone. Also almost forgot to put this in the flaws, the villain in this movie is sh*t, okay so In the trailers Sony basically spoiled the entire movie except for the villain......Why?
Conclusion: There's a lot of stuff to like about Ghostbusters 2016, but most of the time it's kind of a let down."
" Hilarious
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,10,"One thing that was really refreshing and wel-crafted story-wise was that we got to see the Ghostbusters learn as they go, something we don't get that enough in a lot of action thrillers where people get pushed into roles they magically seem extremely gifted to handle. Late McKinnon was hilarious as Holtz, and Chris Hemsworth provided a jaw-dropping comedic performance. Try watching it before you hate it ;)"
" Ghastly
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,2,"'Ghostbusters: Answer the call' gained a notoriety before and after its cinematic release that few mainstream studio financed films would warrant. But this one warranted its reputation.Assembled in front of the camera was a respectable amount of talent. The production was funded and scaled appropriately for acceptable production values.The script and the premise and the directing are not as worthy.A failure to create funny jokes, funny situations, funny images, funny characters, funny relationships, funny routines is a considerable failure for a comedic film.There are a handful of nice jokes and set ups. But by handful I mean really, really, perishingly few and the thudding effect of misfiring comedy efforts is deafening. Eventually this film started to make it almost interesting to mark off the failed efforts at humour, one after the other.If the film had really followed through with its premise of radically positioning itself as a beligerently female remake and gone fully anti men in a sensationally irreverent and implacably pursued effort it may have been better.Instead it declared it's intent but then failed to fire.A film that fails so utterly at its two artistic remits: laughs and subversion is barely worthy of being given any credit.Overall the very game but utterly ineffectual performances do sometimes produce a spark of human life in a random moment of a meandering scene but by and large the standard of the cast is disappointing in its own right.I seldom give scores below 3/10 but this was a chore to watch and has left me almost bereft of ideas for how to complement it.Chris Hemsworth actually added slightly to the film and played an insanely dim and ""unintelligent"" person with an aplomb I had not expected.Perhaps unsurprisingly his part was also one of the few attempts at really attacking male standards that this film got right. Here it landed a couple of ""make men the butt of the joke"" ""the laughs in you guys"" jabs in the form of stupidly funny mixed meaning jokes.Overall I rate a 2 because this film fails in its own terms as much as it does in the eyes of most of its viewers."

" Some dinos should stop clinging to their childhood
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,9,"I admit: when I first heard the new Ghostbusters' movie was going to be with a female cast I was like 'Huh? Why change a winning team?' But then I saw the movie and it was hilarious. I don't know what I liked the most: the little winks to the old movies, 'dumb blond' Chris Hemsworth or goofy Kate McKinnon. This was a comedy just liked it's supposed to be, with original characters and a lighthearted plot. I loved the interaction between the four Ghosbusters and nothing felt like it was a flat copy of the original.Honestly, I'm ashamed for these people who decided beforehand not to like this movie and trash it even after seeing it. These are people who are set on thinking women can't be funny and who are trying to relive their childhood experience with the old movie. Well guess what: the past is over and if you would be the age your are now and saw the original again in the eighties you wouldn't like it anymore.

",2020-02-12 00:00:00,5,Wanted this to be a lot better movie but it just did not have enough laughs. The funniest part of the film was slimmer.
" The plot is so thin you can slice an atom with it
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,2,"the ghosts that want to destroy everything are ""mostly dudes"" (direct quote from the movie)shooting the big ghost in the crotch""safety lights are for dudes"" (direct quote)queef jokes.Are you laughing yet? I wasn't. This movie's plot is so thin they can use it to slice an atom in half. Aside from the blatant sexism, showing men as shallow one-dimensional characters, there are plenty of other things to dislike here. I am all for silly comedies when everyone is a caricature, but this one was designed to apparently somehow ""empower"" women by putting down men. but enough about this aspect.None of the characters are in any way relatable. They just do their thing because the script says so. There is hardly any backstory to any of them (aside from a feeble attempt to give some background to the main character's ghost-enthusiast past turned scientist. Yet it goes nowhere, since her scientific knowledge is never again used, but instead is delegated to the blond sociopath who cannot seem to decide whether her character should be rude, brilliant, offensive, endearing, or psychotic. There is no explanation how and why Leslie's character decides to join the bunch aside from ""having a ride"".There is a bunch of callbacks to the original films but they all end up being profoundly unoriginal. ""don't cross the streams"", and ""we don't have a proper containment unit for the ghosts"" and ""slimer"", etc. Speaking of slimer, now apparently all ghosts leave vast amounts of goo, not just him, making his name completely redundant. There is not a single original concept in this aside from a couple of new gadgets that are better fitting in a James Bond movie. While the original films had a lot of subtle elements and plot lines this one was as subtle as a loud fart in a crowded elevator.Then there's the cameos...One or two would have been nice, but man, all the original cast members had to be there and in roles which couldn't decide whether they play their old selves, or the opposite, or mock their characters.The whole thing was forced, unoriginal, unfunny and over the top for no reason."
" Cliche movie
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,3,"The movie is full of misandrists (like all those TV commercials), not a single one states an opinion that doesn't have to do with the presence of men in the world. You all (I can write in English) should go apologize to your fathers."
" Fun movie
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,10,"The reviews are full of misogynists, not a single one states an opinion that doesn't have to do with the presence of women in the movie. Y'all should go apologize to your mothers."
" Watch the original
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,1,Ghostbusters more like one of the worst things to ever be created. Who you gonna call? The police cause this is offensive! Don't waste your time with this.
" Addiction
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,3,"Hollywood producers and directors are addicts that are beyond medical help.
They are addicted to the drug of remakes and sequels. It is just poor. Copy/inferior paste, copy/inferior paste, ad nauseam foreeeeeeeeeeeverPeople, I cringed for almost two hours trying to get to the end of this DVD. What did it add to the original? To the world? Nothing? Exactly.And Chris Hemsworth! What does he contribute to cinema??"
" Terrible Reboot
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,2,"The opening scene was quite good and my hopes were high. I like Wiig, McCarthy and the rest of the cast in other things but nothing seems to work in this film. The jokes were tedious and fell flat. The CGI was decent but as always not nearly as good as practical effects and seemed overly cartoonish. The action was also cartoonish. They just needed a much better story, and better writing overall. It's hard to live up to expectations with something like Ghostbusters but this movie just fell completely flat. Even the cameos by the original cast fell flat. Ernie Hudson's was decent but lasted only a few seconds. Aykroyd, Weaver and Potts had nothing funny or good to work with. Murray seemed like he was just reading his lines in order to fulfill his contractual obligations as quickly as possible, straight manning his way through a part that turned out to be completely useless. I sincerely hope they don't try to do a sequel to this. The guy receptionist was such a desperate attempt to be funny, and so not funny. The subway worker was the best character of the four Ghostbusters and I can't even remember the actor or character's name, and that tells you everything you need to know about this useless and unnecessary movie."
" Woke Garbage
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,1,"Turrible. Absolutely turrible. Leslie Jones is the worst. Melissa McCarthy is almost as bad. Kate McKinnon is a talentless hack. Kristin Wiig tried to save the movie, but even with the help of Thor, the god of thunder, couldn't rescue this piece of hot garbage."

" Even Adam Sandler would be ashamed of this movie.
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,1,"How do you go from being involved in Freaks and Geeks, The Office, Weeds and Arrested Development to this?! Paul Feig has just lost every ounce of talent he once had. It's really sad because I love all those shows.He has a talented cast to work with. I like both Wiig and McCarthy and MacKinnon has made me laugh several times on SNL. Hemsworth is also a good actor, as are several of the the supporting cast. The script however is just mind-bogglingly bad. It would have been rejected in a grade school drama class. If you add the fact that Feig's direction seems to consist of telling his cast to improvise, and whether the improvs are funny or not (mostly not) keeping them in the movie you have the recipe for a really bad film.There's really no story, no characters to care about and the parts that are supposed to be funny fall flat. It's a waste of money, talent and a franchise that could have been resurrected and profitable, had it been done right."
" Forget the haters
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,8,"I realy loved this movie. These are some pretty amazing actors, doing their thing, being hilarious. I loved the original movie, amd to me this is a great omage to that. Just wonderful. I'm wondering what all the critizism is about. Maybe all male viewers, being sexist? I realy don't get all the hate. I thought it was brilliant."

" Don't agree with all the hate
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,7,"Ghostbusters (2016) is a semi decent film living in the shadow of its predecessor. The acting and humour are definitely hit or miss and could use a bit of improving. However when it comes to the visuals and the action, it's a fun time. Had it been it's own thing, it probably wouldn't have the huge hatred it's garnered."
" Let Ghostbusters rest.
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,3,"This. Was not needed. We did not want this we did not need this. Let Ghostbusters rest. There are 2 movies they are both good (exept the seconds on that is mediocre) those are old movies bit now guess what. CGI! SCARY GHOSTS! GADGETS! AWFUL HUMOR! HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA! Why does this need to exist... Of course it has its moments. But....not too much. Now I want to say this movie is not good. If you look at it then the 2 other movies...and they had to make it into a big ""awesome"" action movie. The old movies all they had we're those backpacks which means they had to stratigize how to defeat the ghosts! But it's gone in this movies... Gadgets...just wow gadgets isn't that awesome! Just. If you watch it and did not watch the first 2 it might be OK. But if you watched the first 2 and then look at this. It's not going to be good. Idk just...i don't like it it's a bad movie in my opinion. That's about it."

" Terrible film.
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,1,Terrible improvisationPoorly actedThe CGI is a jokeNeed I go on? Paul Feig apparently let the cast run wild and do what they want. That is much to the film's detriment.
" Is it funny?
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,4,"That's the simple question to ask when seeing a comedy. Unfortunately for this new Ghostbusters film it is mildly amusing at best. The opening psychic testing scene of the original has more belly laughs than this entire movie.Some great acting talent in Kristen Wiig and others but sadly they do not get the excellent material that was at the heart of the original film. The updated special effects look great but can't make up for the poor writing. 4/10 stars, watch it if you have nothing better to do."

",2019-12-29 00:00:00,1,If you're a Ghostbusters fan avoid this movie at all cost.
" It came; it saw; it....didn't kick much ass.
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,5,"The first name in the end credits of ""Ghostbusters"" is a certain Zach Woods, who is listed as playing a tour guide. Because people are listed by order of appearance, it felt like entire days had passed since that character was on screen. Suffice to say, the 2016 re-envisaging of an 80's family favourite which spawned one sequel and its own cartoon series, ""Ghostbusters"", is a complete slog - too long and ultimately not much more than a fancy demonstration of what the latest in special effects are capable of. Most of its moments, particularly in the final act, exist for TV-spots and trailers - a little stunt followed by a one-liner. Its product placement is shameless and most prevalent in the first hour, during which I suppose it is assumed the audience is still paying the most attention; its popular culture references often painful - please don't remind us of 'the mayor in Jaws', because you're just reminding us of a better film. Maybe you're on-side for a while, but boy does that bell-curve drop off fast.The film covers four women, though lacks any real protagonist, aged between about thirty and forty-five in modern New York City. Erin (Kristen Wiig) is a lecturer at Columbia university who, on the cusp of a promotion, is horrified to discover an old friend named Abby (Melissa McCarthy) promoting something pseudo-scientific via the Internet to do with ghost-hunting that they both toyed with in their university days - something Erin fears her bosses might discover and be put off by. We get a sense of the different routes these women have gone down when Erin pays Abby a visit, whose wacky metallic helmet she has on when we first see her I think is designed to call to mind Emmett Brown's and is meant to infer a sense of the mad scientist who aims high, but often falls flat. Erin, by comparison, wears tweed and speaks more eloquently.Rather than set things straight, Wiig's character is pulled along to an investigation Abby conducts with a younger assistant named Jillian (Kate McKinnon), whose later role in the film is to essentially invent a new contraption whenever the script needs it, at an old haunted house which we watched rattle that tour guide during the opening. It is here the film tries to replicate the memorable scene in the 1984 original, when the eponymous heroes go down into a haunted library and encounter something which takes us all by surprise, but it doesn't quite come off here - it doesn't find that place in-between scary and funny that Reitman found. Regardless, Erin changes her mind; loses both her promotion and job at the behest of a stuffy Charles Dance and moves in with Abby and Jillian to prove the world wrong via the pseudo-science of ghost hunting which, turns out, isn't so pseudo...What the film branches out into from here is a curious mix of genre-tropes; patchy storytelling; some decent gags and a lot of family friendly action scares which, collectively, often fail to justify as to why the remake exists. The women, true to tradition, find a disused space the size of a warehouse to open their titular operation while a fourth member, Leslie Jones' Patty, who conspicuously leaves her stable job as a subway ticket inspector to join this farce, obtains an old hearse that they use as an official vehicle. They hire a receptionist to take calls, a bespectacled simpleton played by Chris Hemsworth named Kevin, who is funny at first, but whose idiocy eventually becomes so unbelievable that you'd think it was the prototype to a new Sacha Baron Cohen character. Erin likes him for his looks; in contrast to three of the women, who are skilled scientists and inventors, Kevin is a buffoon, which if the roles were reversed, and the blonde imbecile was female, would be rightly derided as sexist. And where is all the money coming from to pay for any of this?The film's gender politics, which has so consumed the project and the response to it in the aftermath of its release that rational textual analysis has been tossed aside, seems to gravitate along the frequency of pushing more girls into science, a popular ideological trope amongst contemporary feminism. But this is all surface. McKinnon, who joyfully brings to life the character of Jillian with a series of piercing stares; cheeky smirks and robotic movements, just does not ultimately strike us as a convincing inventor when viewed critically.What's more, it too often feels as if the ideology itself has picked the wrong subject matter for the politick to hand: if we usurped the four women and replaced them with male counterparts at script stage, but kept every scene; action and line of dialogue the same, nothing would change within the contextualised framework. The best feminist texts at the moment in a filmic sense, if that is what you're into, are probably coming out of the Middle East, where actual female-centric narratives and stories about women's issues are being produced, and often by actual women.A character by the name of Rowan fills in for the film's idea of antagonist; well, for most of the time. He's a young, funny looking kid with a strange expression and curly hair who works at a hotel and plots something nasty with evil spirits whom he cannot yet release. A fascist, and so an easy villain to pen, he believes that society cannot be cleansed enough of its undesirables due to past grievances. Neil Casey does what he can with the role, certainly channelling Peter MacNicol from the second film in appearance, but it is a thankless task. Wracking my brain, it is difficult to entirely envisage what a Ghostbusters remake 25 years after the fact was supposed to look like and why it might be at all needed. Was it really necessary? I'm unconvinced it was."

" Insufferably horrible, lousy script, unfunny
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,1,"This is absolute junk. This should have been pulled until they could develop a script.Clearly the studio got greedy and shoved this through the pipe. The only actor is this film that came off as funny is McKinnon. And the new GB theme song? Uh, nope. There is absolutely nothing worth watching. I deleted it from iTunes big-time."
" It's fine
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,7,"It's entertaining. It's corny action humor, just like the 80s versions. It's not Criterion stuff, but that's not the expectation here.I don't know why everyone is so hard on this movie."
" Didn't feel like a Ghostbusters movie
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,2,"The movie was horrible, it felt more like an hour long Saturday Night Live skit, that was released in theatres. It was trying way to hard to be funny, and inevitably lead to not be. Plus the ghost in the movie didn't really realistic at all, like slimer looked more like a big glob of jelly. And the movie wasn't even cannon to the original two movies, and u don't mind reboots, but it would be been different if the last ones didn't come out 27 years before this one did. More to the film, they didn't even have the iconic ecto 1 siren in the movie, like how are you gonna take that away. To be fare the movie did have some good scenes with some action in it, but that's also a bit of problem, because the movie felt more like an action movie, rather than a spooky movie with some comedic elements into it! With the story of the movie. It was horrible. It also factors into my reasoning on why it doesn't feel like a Ghostbusters movie, because the plot is just some guy who got bullied his whole life and wants some revenge, but on all of New York?! That's not a good villain for a ""Ghostbusters movie"". Plus the reasoning for the ghost not looking realistic, is because they are being GENERATED! That's not how these movies are, there supposed be natural ghost, and not artificial, and if you gonna use similar proton packs, then I think you should use the same ghost traps as well, and not these huge ones to that. I'm conclusion, this movie is horrible, I would've given it a one star, if not for the good action scenes. But all together it's not worth seeing if you haven't yet, and it's sure as hell ain't worth rewatching for when Ghostbusters: Afterlife comes out."
" Lackluster, unfunny, forgettable pile of garbage.
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,1,"Where do I start, I didn't even laugh once in the entire movie, Characters were cliche and boring, Performances were poor, The virtue signaling was unbearable, It goes to show how garbage Hollywood has become."
" You'll never get rich...
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,4,".... to quote a good Columbia (Sony) film from the classic era, trashing the fans before the film even comes out. But that was what Sony did when they got a negative reaction from their trailers and could see the train wreck that was coming that would be the release of this film.The humor in this film is very forced, broad, and silly, where the original Ghostbusters film featured dry intelligent humor often coming from just who the characters were and how they interacted.The villain was just awful. He seemed like he was yanked straight out of a cartoon or comic book. The scene at the rock concert - which is shown in trailers - is just goofy. It was like I was watching live action Scooby Doo. Throwing a story into the middle of a concert never really bodes well unless you want to conjure up images of rubber suited turtles doing the 'ninja rap'.And last but not least, this film has absolutely zero problem defying the rules that are established. Proton beams hold the ghosts, the traps capture them until they're ready to be shoved off into a containment unit. They follow the same rules throughout most of the film, but then near the end, the Ghostbusters start using proton beams as if they were able to destroy ghosts, gunslinger style. What the??Because there are fans of this franchise going back 35 years, history matters. And this installment just destroyed all of that. This is not the worst film ever made, but it is definitely not worth your time."
" In all honesty.....this wasn't a movie....that's why it did so badly...
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,2,"I've said this, in reviews before, there are movies and there are political statements. This, whatever it is, was a political statement and they don't make money (Yeah, i know, Captain Marvel....but there's a reason that movie made money....it was about the movies it was placed between and people assuming it was linked to the last Avengers Infinity movie).This is twisted feminist politics trying to prove something....which is why it bombed, why ""part"" of the cast is SO ""toxic"" toward the now 2020 ""real"" Ghostbusters Movies, and why people (who have this useless point of view in Hollywood) can't make it work.When you make a movie that denigrates a certain sex of the audience, a certain color, a certain whatever.....the movie is bound to fail. Doesn't matter what names you throw into it like Chris Hemsworth, you can't make it work.This movie had to go worldwide JUST to pay for it's self, it LOST money in America. True, this event doubled it's production cost outside of the USA but, on the 2016 scale of what movies make, that's not much at all.The director didn't like men and the head of the studio didn't seem to mind that and THIS is what you got.Well, guess what folks? This even is going to be room-mates with ""Highlander 2"" in the Erased From History Hotel.Any of you, who have read my reviews, are educated to know i'm nowhere in the known universe of against female actors. Actually, i'm 110% for them and i could like strong female characters, and their movies, all day long.But those were actual ""movies"", made to entertain, not a pointless political statement and that's why i agree that this (whatever you wanna call it) should be enjoyed by those who ""want"" to like it and forgotten by those who chose to just pretend it never existed. That's just something i can't get thess to realize.....freedom of choice works both ways....even if they don't like it."

",2019-12-13 00:00:00,7,"An all female comedy reboot was unlikely to work, however it does. Ghostbusters is a very entertaining, albeit popcorn flick.It's extremely funny at times, though the nature of the film restricts it somewhat. Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones mostly make it work. I don't see how other reviewers are referring to Melissa McCarthy as the lead, when Wiig plays the only integral character and most definitely is. Holtz's overdone and a tad annoying, not enough to kill the enjoyment though."
" Franchisebusters
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,1,"I think this movie didn't understand the concept of the 84 GB movie. The 86 movie went sort of the same direction as this one. The first gave us a feel for the paranormal and yes, it was silly and yes it was ridiculous but the actors treated it as a ""serious"" movie. I think Paul Feig is really a funny guy, but his strength is more individualized and doesn't translate well to a movie format, in my opinion. TO me, the real problem, and what would have actually justified the film in almost every way... was the main characters. Had they simply made them the daughters of the originals, that would have given me the feels for these new characters. Instead they went with killing off the past and that didn't do anything but make me a sad panda."

" A studio experiment and a huge mistake
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,1,"This is what you get when a studio is desperate for a hit, realizes they still own a name they might be able to make some money off of, and hire the first successful director they can think of. Then throw in a cast that cares more about a paycheck than having respect for the classics. The only good thing that came from this is the fact that we're getting a direct sequel to the originals. Too bad the studio, nor the cast thought this one through."
" Hilarious and Much Needed!
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,9,"I saw this movie twice in theatres, and have watched it several times since then- each time I enjoy it just as much as I did when I first saw it. This movie is refreshing and quirky in its own way- an homage to the original movies but distancing itself enough to make its own mark. The overwhelming backlash this movie received just goes to show how much movies like this are needed! ""Female"" is not a genre. This is a fast-paced comedy about 4 great characters who get thrown into ridiculous situations. It worked with men in the 80s, and it works with women now."
" Women Aren't Afraid Of No Ghosts
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,5,"Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones stars in this female version of the 1984 film that made waves decades ago known by the same title as ""The Ghostbusters"". It was evident that the radical change they made is evidently the so-called gender change wherein now we have female ghost fighters instead of male ones. For another thing,we also get to see better CGI visual technology considering that they never existed more than 30 years ago when the original was made.It was apparent that women wants to show that they themselves are capable of taking care of the ghost. As usual, we get to see the theme of feminism in the picture. As for the studio,it is apparent that they made the movie to make a quick buck. Too bad that bringing back the original movies at present time with the gender change isn't enough. There is a great responsibilities for the remakes as comparisons to the originals will be make. And when it comes to comparison, it is evident that this film does not deliver. Despite the presence of capable female comediennes, we get to see that they don't deliver as they as they lack chemistry as ghost busters. In sense,it never stood to the original. But to its credit, it was better than the recently released Elizabeth Banks' ""Charlie's Angels"" as it is tried its best not to offend men."

" This movie made me change my mind...
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,8,"I was very anti Hollywood reboots/remakes. I refused to watch this movie because I was such a fan of the originals.
I recieved a free online version of the movie and finally watched it.
And it's great!
The story is well written, and I even say it's better than the original story.
All the main actresses work perfectly together, and ALL of the Ghostbusters actually have a reason to be a Ghostbuster, unlike Ernie Hudson's character (who I still love, but really lifts out no problem).
All around great movie!"

",2019-11-09 00:00:00,1,One star is too much. This cast single handily almost tried to kill a franchise. Luckily the classics are so good you can just ignore that this ever happened
" Why all the negativity?!
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,7,"This is a great film! It is really funny! The humour was constant and in the same vein as that of the original: witty, silly, irreverent, and light-hearted. I laughed throughout the movie and was smiling throughout! I love the new characters and the natural chemistry they share. The creators of this film also got the ambiance spot on! It really felt like the world of the original Ghostbusters, with a subtle twist, paying homage to the original, while expressing a fresh voice. In fact, I found this new Ghostbusters to be a good deal more entertaining than Ghostbusters 2. I get that people are getting sick of remakes; to be honest, so am I, and yes, there were moments my inner cynic groaned. Those moments were not, however, enough to ruin the entire film for me; there were 2 of them in the midst of a great many laughs. The negativity in many (most?) of the reviews of this film seems overly hostile and baseless, giving rise in me to suspicion that there is something more going on. If you do not like remakes, then why did you watch this, and why are you putting so much energy into denigrating it? If you did not watch it, then you have no right to be posting a review (and I question whether all these negative Nancies actually even watched the film). I understand writing a constructive, critical review, but most of what I have read have been thoughtless and unhelpful."
" Who ya gonna call? Patriachbusters!
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,1,"When I first watched the original Ghostbusters way back when, all I could think about was how damn sexist it all was. I mean, the idea that only MEN can catch ghosts and that women should be consigned to secretarial roles or portrayed as damsels in distress is just so triggering. What was this, 1984 or 1684? So imagine my delight when I found out that the pariahs of gender equality Paul Feig and Katie Dippold had decided to make reparations with an all-female remake. Don't get me wrong, I'm not totally satisfied with it- I was hoping to see at least one nonbinary and one disabled Ghostbuster- but we all know social justice can be a slow process.The cast is truly excellent and extremely well-conceived. First, we have the slightly-pretty-but-not-so-pretty-she-might-make-female-viewers-feel-inadequate one played by Kristen Wiig. Then we have the fat-yet-funny-and-smart-and-confident one played by the incredibly versatile and Oscar-worthy Melissa McCarthy. Then of course we have the quirky-autistic-spectrum-undercut-hairdo-nerdy one with her non-stop hilarity and sardonic one-liners. And where would we be without the empowered-outspoken-black one with her insightful dialogue and stereotype-busting placid demeanour? This all-star cast of esteemed thespians are Hollywood's answer to the Suffragettes.But without doubt the star of the show is the incredible Chris Hemsworth who takes a selfless stand against the patriachy by showing the world that men are actually useless (except as eye-candy for middle-aged spinsters) and should be sidelined while the women take care of business. That bit where he thought he heard through his eyes instead of his ears was so funny I actually laughed out loud LOL rofl.The plot is so complex and ingenious that it's not really possible to explain in words, but the basic premise is this: there are loads of ghosts in NYC, not sure why, but there's kind of a big X up in the sky that they're attracted to or something and the little weird man is trying to get them all together, not sure why, and it's up to the Patriachbusters to stop them using equipment that the neuroatypical sciency one created despite having no funding or raw materials and in the end the fat funny one falls into some kind of vortex chamber thing and the pretty but not too pretty one jumps in and rescues her on some kind of bungee cord thing and also the Marshmallow man is there again, not sure why, and all the while the empowered black one is saying things she heard on Def Jam Comedy in the nineties for no apparent reason.Oh and the special effects are just incredible. Considering that the editing was clearly done by a 13-year old using an early version of Windows Movie Maker, the final result looks great. The use of green lights and blue lights and red lights and smoke all doing swirly things together was just so original and cutting edge. Slimer and his girlfriend (did I just assume her/his gender?) were particularly impressive- probably some of the best CGI I've seen since the second series of Scooby Doo.One of the most important movies ever made. don't let any bigots mansplain to you that it isn't."
" Who You're Gonna Call?
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,3,"A taxi to get you outta here of course.This film was funny. I yet have to see a good gender switch, and have stopped watching them in any case, but for Pete's sake, what is with the compulsion to make more of these remakes and reboots?
Ghostbusters had Sigourney Weaver being all thin and flaunting. 2016 has arrived and Hollywood makes women ashamed of their bodies and puts them in fat suits or body suits or whatever and like the 'jokes' that is not funny"

So far this 'women's empowerment' movement has produced a steady supply of stolen dreck like this and damn few, if any, original ideas that are impressive or innovative.
Exceedingly pathetic and vapid."
" Waste of a talented cast.
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,1,"I didn't like this movie. I really wanted to. I was hyped from the moment the cast was revealed. Kate McKinnon and Kristen Wiig, with Melissa McCarthy and Chris Hemsworth as Ghostbusters. That sounds like comedy gold. Oh, but the writing.. gosh.. I've never been so uncomfortable during a film. I didn't laugh except at a joke with glasses. Maybe for young kids it's ok. As an adult, I didn't get the humor. Am I missing something? Maybe I'm out of touch. Maybe it just isn't funny. The dialogue is painful. I didn't understand why every character had to be awkward. Any attempt at a joke was a missfire for me."
" Give it a try; you'll be pleasantly surprised
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,10,"Great humor, special effects, and acting. The three leads are dynamic and funny. The one-liners zing right along. The special effects are top notch. Chris Hemsworth smirks and mugs throughout and looks good doing it. I thought I wouldn't like this, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is actually a LOT funnier than the original."
" Easy to tell who the shills are...
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,2,"This movie was cringey, thoughtless, and obviously agenda-driven.
Anyone rating this above a 5 is BS'ing you."
" Why
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,1,My god this is bad it's an absolute heartbreaking insult to the first two movies why don't they come up with their own movies instead of inserting their poisonous ideas into the original ones just please please go away
" Possibly the worst movie ever
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,1,"Looking at what this movie had, big budget, proffesional employees, great actors (not in this though), preceeding great movies. And then looking at the result, an unfunny, product placed, fandom destroying, big studio manipulated, animated cashgrab cringefest. This makes it one of the worst movies of all time.The only thing that could have made this worse was if Rick Moranis was forced into it as well. Paul Feig did probably call him and asked if he wanted to be in it. Rick joked by saying something like: ""Sure.. maybe I could play the dog demon this time."" Whereby Paul Feig said ""Sure thats a great idea! You can be like the ghostbusters pet and..."" Rick then instantly realised that Paul had a mental deficiency and hung up the phone."
" Liked it
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,7,Better than I expected. Had several funny parts. Entertaining. Chris Hemsworth is always a pleasure to watch--stay for the credits to see more of him...literally.
" Why?
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,3,This is the worst movie I have ever seen! Why it was made I don't understand? If I wasn't with friends I would have walked out! The first two were perfect treasures! 💛 Clearly whom ever made this movie never saw the first two. Chris in my mind should have sued for the way he was treated! I get that that's the point but it could have been done better and more subtle.
" Works Better As A Parody than Remake/Reboot
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,4,"The opening scenes during that tour almost lost me. Horrible horrible jokes. I was concerned it was going to go that way for the whole movie.
Thankfully it didn't. The story isn't the same as in the original movie, so why even call it 'Ghostbusters'? Why not call it 'Ghostbusters 2.0' or 'Ghostbusters: Next Gen'?
The jokes I did enjoy were the sly little references to the original movie, like the way the logo was created, or the way the name 'ghostbusters' was finally adopted.
The parts I didn't like were, the technology, which was really dumb (especially in that final fight scene); the initial haunted house scene and follow-up, which seemed random, not related to anything, but apparently tied to the grand scheme of things. I was confused with that initial scene before the intro credits, was the guy possessed or not? It was very confusing. It seemed like that whole beginning, and the characters, were going to play more of a role later, but you never see them again.
And what was the motivation of the putting all those cyber-punk contraptions all over the city? And how come nobody at the hotel noticed he had a giant laboratory in the basement of the building?!! Too many contrived and unexplained scenes that those that made it hard to enjoy. Then there was the finale.
The ending where Kristen Wiig ties here self with a cable and jumps into that vortex was especially bad. Clearly borrowed from Poltergeist, but what didn't make sense was how was she expecting to get back?!! I mean, it wasn't a bungee cord, and nobody was seen pulling her and McCarthy back at the end? They just sort of bounced back. It was baaaad.
Chris Helmsworth was funny as the ditsy receptionist, but some of the gags got tiresome after awhile with him.
All of the cameos with people from the original movie were awesome. Too bad Rick Moranis didn't make an appearance as well.
Overall, the movie is a good Saturday afternoon movie, but it definitely didn't hold a candle to the original film."
" Absolutely horrible to watch
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,1,"I actually dont mind b movies and absolutely loved the original Ghostbuster Movies including Ghostbusters 2.But this is without doubt one of the worst movies I've ever watched. Besides it being sexist and having every Male character in it as Mr Bean level stupid, I can honestly say not one laugh did I get. I got more laughs from Angela's Ashes and Titanic. Awful writing acting and movie. Only redeeming factor was when it was over..If theres something strange in your neighbourhood, whatever you do dont watch new Ghostbusters"
" Boring And Unfunny
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,2,"Even if I ignore the silly plot, which we have seen in countless movies before, the so called ""jokes"" are so unfunny that they are basically just insults and yells aimed at everyone. One will be asking himself ""when is the funny part coming?""."
" A shame on humanity
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,2,"A modern 'Feminazi' remake of the classic Ghostbusters where women are the lead characters.
They have ruined this franchise with such a gender swap in this remake version of the movie."
" Had its Moments
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,5,"The Movie wasnt all bad. But for me as a oldschool Ghostbusters Fan, it was just too much. The effects n stuff were cool but the whole Film is just to overloaded. I have to admit watching the old Ghostbusters Films now they seem more like B Movies but they were still kind of more charming and scary in their way and the guys were more relatable at least to me. Not because the new Team is all female but they just had it too easy in this one. They went through all that Millions of ghosts like terminators with no weakness and that made me never realy worry about them cause they gonna make it anyway.
It was at parts really entertaining but me as a Fan i just didnt have the same feelings watching this anymore.
Hopefully the Ghostbusters go back to the Roots in the new Film coming 2020."
" Fun and New
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,7,"I'm not sure the hate this gets. I hate reboots in general, but this was fun, a different take, and not the exact same story line. I enjoyed it. It can't touch the original Ghostbusters, but I enjoyed it."
" I want my money back

" Really!!!??
",2019-09-16 00:00:00,3,"Waited long enough to even consider watching this. Was still too soon...i cannot justify this WHOLE gender reverse remake thing. Looks like angry-L wrote it and yesssss had to have an idiot eye-drop Thor to make the point even more explicit.Wouldn't it be better to have ""your"" own franchise rather than ruining our childhood ones?Agenda!!??? Is it worth it?"
" Not as bad as its made out to be
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,7,I know it's not a perfect film and not a patch on the original but it's not that bad. If it was a film in its own right it would have been a lot better received. A lot of the negative criticism comes from comparing it to the original. It's entertaining and fun if a little silly at times. Watch it for yourself and make your own mind up. I enjoyed it
" Super disappointed...the comedy was so bad!
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,3,"Went into this movie without having read the reviews or watched the trailer...had no expectations except to have a couple of laughs in a fun movie. The start of the movie had so much potential, really thought it was going to be pretty good. It just went downhill from there, with the comedy being so flat and not clever at all. The story was basically just a rehash, but with different characters. Also don't know why they chose to portray the black character in the stereotypical way they did....oh and, Chris Hemsworth's character was just so bad (what a waste of an actually really funny actor). Got so bored half way through, with the terrible comedy and bad plot, I honestly can't even remember the ending. All in all, this movie just was not funny, the jokes were terrible, and I don't know if I actually genuinely laughed during the movie."
" They Are Already Making Another Ghostbusters
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,3,"And it is our fault.It is my fault.It is your fault.This gender switch Ghostbusters was unfunny, gross and mostly forced.
The bigger picture is the lack of originality and freshness. Hollywood has normalized the endless remakes and reboots, a world where everything is a franchise, but it should not be. It is about new experiences and not the staleness of the familiar. This one was distinctly angry and put women into a position of adequateness when in fat body suits, but we the audiences need to demand better."
" Absolute waste of time
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,1,"I would call this movie garbage but I don't want to insult garbage
Cast, plot, acting
Take your pick
It all sucked."
" A distaff reboot of an eighties classic
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,7,"If like me you enjoyed the original film you are likely to go into this with some trepidation; now having watched this I'd say it isn't a classic but it still provided plenty of laughs and a few mild scares.Erin Gilbert is a physics professor at Columbia University on the brink of gaining tenure... then a book about ghosts which she and her college friend Abby Yates wrote as a joke years ago is reprinted; not something a serious scientist can be associated with. She goes to see Abby, who is now researching ghosts at a far less prestigious institution. They, along with Abby's research partner Jillian Holtzmann, go to a reported haunting; Erin's scepticism is ended when a ghost covers her in slime! Soon all of them are sacked but continue their ghost hunting. They are later joined by Patty Tolan, a subway worker and hire the less than capable Kevin Beckman to work as their receptionist. The number of sightings is increasing but, not wanting to cause a panic, the authorities claim it is all a hoax. The Ghost Busters continue their investigation and surmise that somebody is working to bring the ghosts to New York... things will get worse before they get better.I can understand why some fans of the original will really dislike this but I thought that, even though it wasn't as good, it still provided plenty of laughs and the central story was rather fun... although the antagonist was less menacing than the original's 'Zuul'. The characters are solid and work well together. Having the Ghost Busters changed to four women wasn't really necessary and may be seen as a nod to political correctness by some, but for me it wasn't a problem. Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy are solid as Erin and Abby, two nicely different characters but it is Kate McKinnon steals many scenes as Jillian, who is a little too enthusiastic at times; especially when demonstrating new ghost busting devices. Leslie Jones provides some laughs as Patty and Chris Hemsworth is funny as dumb blond secretary, who was employed for his looks, Keven. The special effects are very good, making some scenes scary in a way that is suitable for youngsters. Overall I wouldn't call this a must see but I found it to be worth watching... is was certainly more than worth the twenty pence I paid for the DVD!"
" Funny with a Great Story.
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,7,"Review:
'Ghostbusters' is an American supernatural-comedy film directed by Paul Feig. It is a reboot of the 1984 film of the same name and is the third film in Ghostbusters franchise. I watched this movie over half a dozen times now and I swear it gets more and more funny every time I watch it. I really believe that people are just stuck in their ways and will never come to terms that anybody can play any character. This movie is called ""Ghostbusters"" and has the same premise as the original, but it tells a different story entirely.
The story focuses on four women (Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones) and their assistant (Chris Hemsworth) who begin a ghost-catching business in New York City.
Everybody in this movie is so funny! Each actor played their role perfectly. When the movie needed to be more than just funny, they got the actors who can act do those roles - Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig - that's not taking anything away from the amazing and wonderful that is Kate McKinnon. The characters are great, but the main trio really take this movie to heights that not even I would have expected.
No where is the story does it say that the characters had to be played by men, nor did it say it had to be played by women. The creators of the film decided on what they thought would work best, and it turned out be a funny and entertaining film. Get on board with the equality train people, it's 2019 and anybody can do anything they want. Story, comedy and characters I really enjoyed. They did a good job playing homage to the original film and characters; however, they stretch it out throughout the whole film and intertwin the Easter Eggs into the story itself and I found myself at times being taken out of the main story because of it.
Overall, this it not your 1984 'Ghostbusters'. If you can get past that and actually enjoy the story that a new generation is trying to tell, you can really enjoy this film.
3.5/5"
" What a disgrace to a beloved classic
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,1,"I'd give this no stars if possible
I grew up with the original Ghostbusters movies and was unhappy that it was being rebooted with no connection to the originals. I had no problem with the gender of the new cast. I find all four leading ladies to be very funny and was optimistic until I saw the trailers proving what a train wreck that was about to be experienced. I avoided watching this in theaters because I know I would probably end up walking out when I saw how terrible it would be. I decided to give it a chance when it showed up on a movie channel and sure enough, I ended up absolutely hating it. The cast was fine, but the story was terrible, the jokes were lame and it honestly felt more like a Ghostbusters parody on SNL than an actual Ghostbusters movie. The originals were funny, but they both had scary and memorable moments that forever reside in my mind and were made as serious movies. This abomination had none of that. I watched it once, and I'll never watch it again."
" I don't understand all of the negative reviews
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,10,"This film doesn't get enough credit. It's a fun film, the casting is great in it and it makes me giggle."
" Can't flip past it
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,10,Everytime I see this movie on tv I have to watch it. So fun.
" It was pretty okay. With the negative hype, I expected much worse.
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,7,"After hearing about so much negativity surrounding this film, I never bothered watching it in theatres. However, after finally watching it (the extended cut, if that makes any difference), I cannot honestly say that it was a bad movie. I absolutely think that there were a few points where the movie pushed a little too hard for the ""girl power"" take on something, although the concept overall did not bother me.Overall, the movie is clearly meant to be fun, entertaining and not taken too seriously."
" Surprisingly funny
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,9,This remake works perfectly. The girls are funny in their own way and it adds to the Ghostbuster's cannon. I am not sure why people are complaining. I thought this was super entertaining. The story flowed well and it combines action with comedy in thrilling way.
" crap
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,1,"Yet another remake and reboot and gender switch just so they can put even more of your money in their bank account.
It is stupid and gross. I am not into fart jokes.
The sole man in the movie was as manly as Walmart is about quality.
Never again with reboots and franchises."
" Not a bad idea, just badly done
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,4,"I've no real problem with an all female ghostbusters film the only problem I have with this is that it's not very good. The comedy isn't funny and the acting is not much better. There are a couple of scenes that aren't too bad, mostly with Chris Hemsworth, the effects are very good but it's a shame it just doesn't work."
" WHAT A DISGRACE
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,1,"I grew up with the Ghostbusters legacy and it always gave me warmth and deep satisfaction to re-watch the original two movies and replay the Ghostbusters video game over and over again.That new movie is a disgrace not only to the Ghostbusters franchise, but to the horror-comedy ghost movies mashup in general.I am not sexist. I love good horror or action movies with female leading roles like Aliens or Terminator 2 or Annihilation 2018. My favorite games all have strong female characters like Lara Croft. I deeply respect strong female characters in all forms of art.I feel that this movie not only presents the whole genre in bad light but also the female leading role as being absolutely ridiculous and at times disgusting.I look forward to a good future Ghostbusters movie with strong female leading characters, just not one directed by Paul Feig."
" Ghosts schmost

" This worked
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,8,"It was nostalgic, fresh, little lost and strangely shot at times, but Kate McKinnon is the best and I'd watch another one of these!"
" I never leave reviews. That's how bad this was
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,2,"It was awful and I am so disappointed. So bitterly disappointing. The movie had so much potential and it fell WAY short. I don't know what was worse, the writing, acting or direction."
" A good cast and enjoyable goofy-fun vibe keep this poorly written story watchable
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,6,"It's mediocre, thanks to writing that's often awkward and contrived and a plot that doesn't make a whole lot of sense (especially in the final act-where did the villain get these powers all of a sudden?). That's probably half due to the campy concept though, and the film with its solid main quartet does well at matching it with a goofy-fun vibe throughout that's enjoyable even when the jokes don't land (Jillian's lip-syncing and Kevin's interview are bits that definitely do though-I lol'd)."
" I tried
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,5,"Although i did try to enjoy this version, I confirm Ghostbusters is a film that should not be remade or rebooted except if it was a direct sequel to the 80's version. One being Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Sigourney are a difficult act to follow. Two, the 80's era was different ..and nothing current can recapture the feel of that time. I tried to be objective but lastly couldn't convince myself that this film brought anything new to the ghost busting world other then to replace iconic actors. Bold move but it didn't work for me. Technically not a bad film but you can't redo what was already good with iconic actors."
" worst CGI ever!
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,2,"Since when was Goosebumps styled CGI applicable for something as holy as the Ghostbusters franchise?! sorry, but Hemsworth performance was vomit worthy, the writing and acting terrible in oh so many ways... i wanted to like this woke take on the tale but everyone i was watching this with wanted to leave after just 30 mins... no one should have been paid for this atrocity... and that is being generous... the director should be ashamed and used the Alan Smithee pseudonym instead..."

",2019-07-20 00:00:00,10,"10/10 - had me rolling (especially Kate McKinnon) - contrary to popular opinion, I think this one is much better than the original"
" Silly and embarassing
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,3,"If a ""Ghostbusters"" remake must have the primary goal of destroying ""ghosts"" like wittiness, suspance, fright, irony, adventure and ""patriarchy"" this movie is perfect.
Needless to say the 1984 original - a masterpiece - looks legendary in comparison."
" Good enough for cable
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,4,"I didn't see this movie when it was in theaters but back then it got some rap; I thought it was prejudice as I was one of those who had ideas about it even before seeing it, but it turns out it was a well deserved rap.
The first ones are cult movies because people liked them, and part of it was because of the characters; we felt empathy with them. Funny enough, it was not Melissa McCarthy the one that pissed me off as I thought it was gonna happen; instead it was Kate McKinnon whose character turned to be irritating every time she appeared. As it happens in Hollywood you can not recognize the personality of a character if it is not based on clichés, and how can you tell she is a genius if she does not act weird and be a jerk all the time (normal people would not understand). Kate McKinnon is the most obvious case, but all characters are supposed to be the equivalent of a character of previous movies; yet it feels forced and formulaic, and does not feel like something a real person would do. In general is overacted and all cameos feel like filling a quota. The effects, though not bad, neither are something out of the ordinary as any movie that uses CGI today. As a good point the characters that appear most on the screen are also tolerable (Wiig and McCarthy). Not a piece of art, but good enough to pass the time in a weekend when you are too lazy to check what else is on."
" Immature & Idiotic
",2019-07-11 00:00:00,1,"All the fandom stuff aside, this movie makes Dude Wheres My Car seem mature! It is like it was wrote and acted by a bunch of under developed adult babies. There was no subtlety, no witty jokes. Everything was blunt and slapstick and as far from the original Ghostbusters as that version with the gorilla was!"
" ""Whose Ghost Is it Anyway""
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,3,"I would say this movie had poor writing, but it seems as though the majority of the film was improv which is a risky choice for any feature film, especially one of this magnitude. Not even the talented cast portraying these characters could save this ""Whose Ghost Is it Anyway"" spoof poop, brought to us by Sony."
" GHOSTBUSTERS

" Not particularly funny
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,3,"I should qualify this review by first saying that I think the first Ghostbusters, while amusing, is overrated. Despite having seen it a number of times I've never quite understood it's status as a great comedy. Maybe that disqualifies me from reviewing this version of Ghostbusters since I don't really appreciate the franchise as a whole. In any case, aside from three or four reasonably decent laughs generated by Kristen Wiig and Chris Hemsworth, this version is painfully unfunny. This means that even its homages to the original Ghostbusters fall flat because they occur within a decidedly not very good movie. And now we have word that there is yet another reboot planned - a direct sequel to the original. Good luck with that."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,6,"With ridiculously low expectations, this movie was pleasantly surprising. Fun for the most part with lots of good laughs. There is also some really dumb stuff but it is enjoyable for the most part. Chris hemsworth's character was hilarious (1 viewing)"
" Sorry version.
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,2,Goofy with attempts at funny. Otherwise snore and unoriginal.
" I gave it a chance.
",2019-06-19 00:00:00,1,Wow but in the worst way. I stumbled upon this movie and felt I should give it a chance. I knew it would never hold up to the originals but i wasn't expecting that bad. I cant believe so many people came together and ok'd this. The CGI in the Scooby Doo movies was better than the CGI in this movie. I like all the female leads but they missed the mark on this one.
" It's ok, but the chemistry just isn't quite there
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,6,"I'll start by saying that I don't think this movie stands by itself. And, I think that's its critical flaw. You can't really watch this movie without ultimately comparing it to the original movies. And, they are stylistically very different.The new movie does not take itself seriously at all. The actors are constantly doing bit humor throughout, and the smaller vignettes can be very funny. But, it's like trying to use a series of sketch comedy episodes to tell a single story. Whereas when I think of the original movies they seemed more like a single cohesive story in which the actors simply found themselves in funny situations.The acting was all very well done, and the humor bits worked well by themselves. The fact that it played as a series of sketch comedy episodes to me ultimately detracted from the whole.If this particular set of actors had their own new story vehicle that was not trying to rework a beloved set of stories I think they would be much better served. It's really hard to reboot a franchise that was done so well in the first iteration. And, they did a good attempt, but you can see where at every corner the script tried to borrow from the original but do it just a little bit differently. It just happened too many times to not be noticeable.Since the acting and humor were good I want to give the movie a higher rating. But, because the script just doesn't seem to stand on its own, and it just doesn't compel me to want to re-watch the movie like the originals I find myself marking the movie down a bit."
" Sony has lost it
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,1,"One more thing to the list as to never have been remade.Not on joke lands even though you have some funny ladies there and it feels so desperate, like begging the audience ""pls, laugh"""
" WYLION - Are you a god? Zappp!
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,5,"No this movie is not a god so it deserves a zap.When deciding to remake a movie as iconic as Ghostbusters you need to make sure you do it right. This is something that wasn't taken into consideration for this version. When comparing the pros and cons, the cons far outweighs the pros. ""Why is this?"", you may ask. Have a watch and you will understand.Personally I thought the movie was fun and did have moments that had me laughing. The only issue was it felt very cheesy and lacked any effort to link the emotional connection between us (the viewer) and the characters. All I can say is thank god for Kate McKinnon (the main source of entertainment throughout).Something you may also be wondering to yourself is ""Why are the Ghostbusters female when the characters have always been male?"". The answer to that question is that due to the current society we live in people think it will be a huge draw for the movie. Of course that comes at the cost of possibly ruining a franchise.I'd say while this movie really isn't good it is still worth watching, once a year in the Halloween period."
" A grim, shallow, badly acted copy too many.
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,2,"Tha characters are so unconvincing, you honestly end up not caring what happens to them. The only actors of quality have awful and wasteful roles. Screenplay is poor and disconnected. Plot (Plot?) was pointless. I did not get to the end, I must admit. I had begun to feel my life ebbing away and could stand no more."
" Tedious
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,2,"I'm not sure what's wrong with this movie apart from the predictable script, hackneyed plot, poor acting and disappointing special effects.
The four leading actresses really don't work well as a team. Kate McKinnon's 'zany' character is unconvincing and downright irritating. Kristen Wiig seems to play the same character in almost every movie.
Chris Hemsworth's character (a clunky attempt at role reversal) is just plain embarrassing.
The special effects are really not that special - they don't appear to have moved on much from those in the original movie.
Overall, The sheer fun and exuberance of the original has been lost. A great shame."
" Meh..
",2019-06-08 00:00:00,7,"I wouldn't say it's the movie of the universe, but it has that special kind of humor that is hilarious at 2 am. I really liked the fighting scene too, but the ending was meh."
" Loved it
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,10,It's so funny. Special effects are awesome. I loved it. Bought it. Will watch it again and again
" Overacting

" Lots of fun for families
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,8,"I was amazed by the number of poor reviews that this movie received, it certainly doesn't deserve them, it's actually quite good.
We had a lot of fun watching this movie as a family but we did not approach it as a remake, nor a sequel, the original actors are well in their late 60s and would look a little out of place running in garbage suits. Of course, we laughed at the cameos and the references to the old movies. It's amusing to have ladies as the ghostbusters and it does give a different group dynamic, a little like the reverse image. OK, the baddy is a little bland, but the jokes are good, the machines are crazy and the actors are just right.
Cranky reviews are all referring to the fact that it's a remake, well that's nothing new to the creative industry. Hollywood has always made remakes think Dracula, Stepford wives, body snatchers, 3 godfathers and the list goes on.... and theatre has done the same too. Other reviews just talk about feminism, these are the nastiest and are plain scary as to how some men think.
So yes, if you have a daughter who aspires to something else than being a dumb pink sex object looking for a charming prince that will turn into a toad, this movie is perfect. As for my son and my hubby, they both know I wear high viz and steal cap boots."
" Horrible !!!
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,1,A total mess. Not funny and Hollywood just doing their liberal thing to do. Leave classics alone and write some original screenplays.
" So funny, people need to calm the hell down
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,10,"This is not a remake but it absolutely hilarious. With the same formula, the receptionist is super funny. The women hold their own and the plot is interesting and captivating. I would highly recommend this movie and am disturbed by the trend of female-lead movies being judged much harsher. Kate McKinnon is a great, AS ALWAYS...Melissa McCarthy is great and far more serious than usual and Kristen Wiig kills the anxious chick, as usual. The villain is creeeeeepy. Overall, just a great and entertaining movie."
" A 10 to balance out the low?? scores
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,10,"When you purposely low ball a score on a movie because you're mad it was a reboot which is as it's marketed, you lose your credibility. If any of these angry reviewers did any research at all, they'd see exactly why it isn't a sequel... Why it doesn't follow the original storylines...Ackroyd wanted a reboot with female ghost busters. That's the point. If you thought it would be a serious movie, look at the actors involved. They are all comedians. The movie is a comedy. It was always going to be a laugh intended goofball of a movie. The original character plots with the busters as scientists and a civilian is still the story arch here. A lot of people are claiming not to be ""-ists"" but when you say you aren't and then go after minorities, you are. As for the people crying about the way the actors looked, grow up. Not everyone is supposed to be built like a model...not even oscar-awarded actors. The technical aspects are point on and the colors are perfect for a scifi movie. Also, I want to rewatch this in 3D because I bet the ghosts are terrifying to watch. All in all, it's a fun movie and I hope women get to reboot and redo all the movies they damn well want. -Proud feminist"
" Bloody fantastic movie!
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,10,Ignore the negative reviews. This movie is hilarious! It's a fantastic sequel to the previous classics. The new 👻 busters are so very funny. Great casting. Great script. I love it.
" Don't waste your time and money!
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,1,"I watched it on YouTube TV used 3 days. Because I fall asleep 2 times. I saved it in my library, if I cannot sleep, this movie will be the best option to deal with it."
" Right...In...the...Childhood
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,1,"This will be my first public review of a movie. Normally, I'd say to each their own, but to each and all, I say avoid this film!I gave it a few years before watching it to let the hype and controversy calm down, so I could go in with an open and fresh mind, interested in seeing how this would play out.Unfortunately, this film was a waste of the nearly two hours of my life. Had this been more of a ""passing of the torch"" film, I'd have been happy, but this screams nothing but ""men are stupid evil pigs, and women are the superior gender!"". Characters and their chemistry are blasé if not utterly void of any camaraderie. Story: lacklustre. Special Effects: dismal and an eyesore. Harold Ramis would be spinning in his grave to see this pathetic excuse of a comedy-horror film.This movie has done nothing to change my opinion about reboots and remakes. All they seem to be is nothing more than a kick right in the childhood and extort your lunch money like the big blundering idiotic bullies of yesteryears. Stick with the first two Gold-Standard films, and if a cartoon fan, ""The Real Ghostbusters.""Let this Spirit go to its eternal rest."
" Decent, enjoyable, I don't understand the hate.
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,7,"First of all, it's a Ghostbuster reboot, it's not a Schindler's list reboot, so turn your expectations down a little bit. I had a few laughs, mostly with chris hemsworth's character, but also with a few moments with the girls.
The story is decent, again, it's a Ghostbusters movie, no plot twists, no oscar worthy scenes, just the girls hunting some ghosts.
I don't understand the hate, it's even produced by Dan Aykroyd and all the actors did a cameo, so it's good enough for them.
Luckily there was only one fart joke (I thought it was going to be plagued with them) and a couple of cringy jokes that failed to connect, but overall the humor in this one is good enough.It was a funny ride, just another decent comedy to relax your brain and eat some popcorn."
" Under Appreciated and fantastic effects
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,10,"I went into this with an extra open mind because all the ""ruin my childhood already"" crap/hype really annoyed me, but the original was the very first movie I saw in a theater and is part of who I am as a person. Bill Murray is intimidating to follow let alone put on his shoes, but they did it wonderfully. It has a strong script with tons of room for the casts endless improv talents. I want to say that one stole the movie but everyone crushes their character, Thor comes close to stealing this film though. He was a HUGE surprise and enormous joy! Jones can be intense on SNL, which I appreciate and enjoy but isn't for everyone, she is terrific in this movie! Not not intense but unnoticeabley so, she's happy exuberant and I love her positive addition to the group and film. Everyone holds their own in this film and isn't afraid to break pace for a well timed joke, or a joke that breaks pace. I don't explain it well, but They can make fun of themselves, have an uncool moment, sacrifice no laughs. Also the effects are incredible! Really bright colors and plenty of spook! The toys are really fun and cleaver.
The ghosts are really scary, the balloon scene is extra spooky and realistic. The relationships are authentic and I'm going to be honest, the original movie didn't hit as many emotions as this movie does. When Wigg dives in to rescue her friend it is beautiful touching and oddly believable, in the way that you believe she'd really do that. The lack of music in this scene is extremely effective and made me cry a wee bit. I enjoyed this movie even more then I could hope, which I tried not to do but couldn't help it."
" pure garbage
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,1,"This movie is pure garbage, the actresses are garbage, everything is garbage, simple as that"
" Hilarious

" Do yourself a favour and go watch the original.
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,2,"I only watched this movie because I was trapped on a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean.It wasn't good. It went for cheap laughs, generic tropes and pandering. Avoid."
" Stop
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,2,"When i heard about how this movie was going to be made i was nervous to say the least, on one hand i was thinking that maybe it would be a good movie like the originals and not just a big studio trying to pull off that nostalgia trick, but on the other hand i feared it may just be that, a movie that attempts to use nostalgia and a relevant political movement to it's favor.
The movie itself was flawed, for one they are all comedians, there is not one single person in the main cast that is not constantly trying to make jokes, everything feels like a SNL sketch and it gets annoying fast.
we get like 5 minutes of character development before they start making fun of whatever they see.
you can't have all the main cast being the comedic relief.
so it turns out feeling like a SNL parody of the ghostbusters with some feminism mixed in."
" A painful 116 minutes
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,4,"Four, all rather eccentric, women bust ghosts in New York City. Remake/reboot of the 1980's classic. I found all four annoying, simply could not warm to any of them. And as for their Aussie male side-kick Kevin, arrghhh! This was meant to be comedy but I found very little to laugh at. It proved to be a very long 116 minutes, within the first 10 I knew that I'd just have to grin and bear it.
However, I did like the special effects, by far the best thing about the movie. Nice to see Charles Dance, a fine English actor, in a fairly minor role. Bill Murray & Dan Aykroyd, from the original, make predictable cameos. Sigourney Weaver pops up, as does Ozzy Osbourne with the best gag in the whole film. There is a short post credit scene, should anyone be interested.
As with the majority of recent remakes the original is by far better, glad I saw this for free on TV as opposed to wasting my money."
" Loved it!
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,10,So cute and funny! I enjoyed it! Hemsworth is hilarious!
" Terrible! Why!
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,1,"Hi! Let me start with the first 15 mins. Melissa Mcarty is just terrible...kirsten Wiig is ok but honestly. DONT waste ur time with this movie. Its just horrible.First of, why make a remake?..well, duh! To make money ofc. We all know this. But why put such an horrible actor as Melissa McCarthy in the lead?... She is fat and cant act...Obesity shouldn't be promoted. Acting should. And about the movie? No story and the producers must have been on acid or something coz this isnt good.No need to watch this as its a good example of how to nake an original story go bad...just coz of money. Please dont pay cash for this junk."
" A failed attempt of a Ghostbusters film
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,1,"This film is absolute trash. I liked the idea of an all female ghostbusters crew and the cast had great potential. But to make a reboot is just plain stupid. It could have been some kind of sequel that acknowledged and followed the original films. But instead we got this pathetic joke of a film. What a waste of a great opportunity. Aside from the reboot nonsense, the plot is boring, special effects feel like its a childish made-for-tv-movie, the character's lines and development are contrived, flat, and foolish, the ghost busting equipment looks like stuff built out of garbage, and the HQ is a cheep filthy garage. This is not a ghostbusters film in any way other than by name."
" Disgrace to the franchise
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,1,"Found it very disappointing that this was released under the series. Dont recommend watching it, you'll be wasting your time and would just be very disappointed if your a Ghostbusters fan."

not recommended.

" Must comedy degrade women?
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,1,"Is Kristen Wiig like this in real life? Or is she a man pretending to be a woman? She portrayed a Columbia professor in the movie, who happens to be extremely ignorant and annoying. She is ugly, dumb and inconsiderate. She would go out of her way to prove her point for whatever little recognition from whomever nobody despite doing so would cause great harm to her team and society! Whose understanding of a female Columbia professor or female protagonist is like this?"
" Terrible movie
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,1,I will never ever ever finish watching this movie this movie was no good there is nothing like the original Ghostbusters hopefully they'll come out with a Ghostbusters 3 a continuation of the original Ghostbusters movies
" A good laugh, strong female leads
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,6,"People are really bashing this film, due to them comparing it to the original, when it should be judged as a stand alone film, a simple one that is a ball of laughs for all ages.
This film has a good female cast with rememberable quotes, with some great cameos from the original cast.
People need to chill, ofcourse it doesn't compare to the 80s classic, it's not supposed to, it's just a kind hearted silly film that can give ya a good laugh."
" Written and made by women for women
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,2,"This terrible, terrible remake is a film version of the woeful UK alleged sitcom ""Miranda: written and made by women for women. A film for the #meetoo generation!"
" Saw It For Free And I Still Want My Money Back
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,1,"I want to preface this with the fact that when I went to see this, I left all my biases at the door. I wanted this to be a good movie. Having said that, this is my review:There is nothing redeemable about this movie. It did absolutely nothing for my opinion on it. There was barely anything funny or amusing. The few things that were 'funny' were almost immediately followed by something that sapped away any smirk I might have had. Kevin the secretary was the least funny thing in this schlock, even bordering on insulting.Rowan's motivation was overwhelmingly simple. He wanted to bring the ""fourth cataclysm"" because was that he was picked on and teased and saw this as a way to get back at everyone. There are hundreds of other things the writers and directors could have picked that would have been better and, more importantly, relatable. If they would of gone with an idea like he wanted to bring back a dead relative, that would of been better. However, what really bothered me was that he gained the powers of Gozer from the 1984 Ghostbusters simply because he killed himself.Even the ghostbusters themselves were terrible (the characters, not the actors.) Every one of them seems to be written to be the comic relief and fails. At the end scene, they just seem to have commando fighting abilities even though there is nothing to indicate they could carry themselves in such a manner.Overall, the comedy in this was virtually non-existent. The characters were laughable, but not in a good way. Finally, the plot was paper thin and unbelievable. I honestly believe that this poor excuse for a movie could only be found good by the lowest common denominator of the general public."
" I Dare You Not To Laugh
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,2,"Ha. How many times have you seen that on the internet. And did you laugh? No! Why? Because it was lame. Not funny at all. Remember when this movie came out and they said, ""you don't think it was funny because their women"". Well guess what? It's not funny because you have women trying to act like men and they aren't funny. Women can be funny. Carol Burnett for example. For a matter of fact Melissa was funny until she got big. Then she got lame. And this blonde who does Hillary imitations. She is so not funny. And her imitation of Hillary was horrible as well. And I don't like Hillary. And than the one who is trying to play the straight. That character is so weak. No one like a weak character."
" Why why why!!
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,3,I cant understand how a franchise like Ghostbusters can be abused like this. Disapointed on many levels.
" Think of it as a separate franchise
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,6,If you are watching this expecting the same as the original you will be disappointed but if you think of it as a separate film it's a decent watch
" Take It For What It Is
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,6,"I think the movie is not terrible, it makes me laugh just like the old one did as a kid. Now what I had to do was look at the movie as it's own and not a replacement of the old Ghostbuster movies; after that and only after that could I sit and really enjoy it. I have to admit I love th actresses in the movie, but had alewady judged the film before it aired years back and counted it out, but please try not to compare if you can at all help it."
" Please trust the reviews of the ""original fans"" - Not!
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,10,"Hmm. Lots of ""original fans"" out there, people who allegedly ""grew up"" with the movie and hated it. Well, for 50 year olds you're pretty immature. And your syntax is wrong for Gen-Xers.
Normally I avoid Melissa McCarthy movies. I barely tolerated her in Gilmore Girls, and she's been atrocious in everything else but she's toned it down and I actually enjoyed watching her.
This movie was, surprisingly, scary. The ghosts were well constructed with some callbacks to the original. Loved the appearance of the original stars. The effects were pretty good.
Is this great cinema, in all honesty, no, but not do I think it deserves the low ratings given by immature boys. Also no.
Watch it, you might enjoy it."
" Get over yourself OG Ghostbusters fans
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,9,"Okay, so I didn't even like the original Ghostbusters, but my son loves them. So I watched it for him and you know what? I actually enjoyed it. I thought it was funny and liked every bit of it. You guys are absolutely insane to actually be slamming this for no reason other than being super fans of the old ones and hating that these are women and that *heaven forbid* a man isn't the smartest person in the movie. No, I'm not on the feminist train. Get a grip guys. Just enjoy a freaking movie for once."
" Cue the Theme Song...
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,3,"Even if you look at this as a stand-alone film (not a remake) it is terrible. Without any sentimentalality towards the original, gave this a open-minded view in the hope to gain something from this. I normally love Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon, but this was not salvageable. I give this an additional two stars for these two, over the 1 star I would normally do."
" Campy and funny
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,8,"I was entertained throughout. The cast has good chemistry and you can tell everyone had fun making this silly movie. You're missing the point if you're honestly able to get angry reviewing a comedy movie on IMDb. Y'all need some Haterate pronto!! No, seriously!"

Loveable characters, some laugh out loud lines, a good baddie and great cameos by old favorites. I know there was a lot of outrage from original fans which may have warped perception of this film but it's a long long way from the '1's that people are gleefully awarding it. Treat it as a new film and have some fun with it."
" Ghostbusters 2016???
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,1,"All I can say after trying to watch this movie
it's the worst ghostbusters movie EVER"
" Had to be a Writer Flaw
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,1,"I watched this because these comediennes are my favorite from SNL on which I die of laughter, ESPECIALLY Queen Kate McKinnon. The movie was not funny whatsoever. It had to be a writer flaw since it is impossible for every single comedienne in this movie to not be hilarious, or even mildly funny, when they are always hilarious. THIS WAS SO DISAPPOINTING!"
" Stick with the original.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,1,"This film wasn't feminist . It opens with a queef joke and our ""geniuses"" do things like licking their blaster (the intelligent one shouldn't be doing things like that). Also destroying ghosts should not be possible and really rubbed me the wrong way, I preferred when they were captured. The original was funny but had it's serious points, like Buffy The Vampire Slayer TV series. It also had a lot more respect to real parapsychology."
" An interchangeable and weaker ""Rule 63"" version of the original.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,5,"Look, I'm all for giving women a shot in traditionally male-focused franchises, but when all it boils down to is an application of ""Rule 63,"" then I don't think we're doing these women justice. In this remake/reboot, the visuals and weapons get an upgrade, and that's about it. If they truly wanted to make a ""Ghostbusters with women,"" then the characters shouldn't have been so interchangeable with the originals. I understand the need to maintain the parallels to the original, but these characters come off more like men in women's bodies than women who have their own, unique challenges and approaches to solving problems.If anything, Ghostbusters (2016) shows how extraordinary the comedy and special effects of the original Ghostbusters (1984) were. While the original usually earned its laughs with a wink, this remake had jokes that mostly relied upon awkward and uncomfortable situations or faux pas. I get that sometimes the improvisational nature of comedy can work for people who got their start on Saturday Night Live (as 3/4 of the cast has). But when it seems like the camera was left on to capture random moments/outtakes/bloopers that made it into the final movie, the 4th wall is broken, and the illusion of the film fails.Despite all this, the movie itself is mostly entertaining. Even if it heavily borrowed from the original, then it still meant you were watching the original in some form. And the original was entertaining. Some of the plot points were tightened up a bit, and the city of New York felt more like a character than a backdrop, both of which I appreciated. The cameos from the original cast were fun but mostly unnecessary. I can only hope that the sequel (if it is ever made at all) does a better job of taking its women seriously.An interchangeable and weaker ""Rule 63"" version of the original, I give Ghostbusters 2.5 stars out of 5."
" A TOTAL DISGRACE TO THE CINEMATIC LEGACY OF GHOSTBUSTERS
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,1,"I think it is fair to say that political correctness was the kiss of death for this GHOSTBUSTERS remake/reboot.It amazes me, how Hollywood doesn't learn its lesson regarding political correctness. No matter how liberal America (and the rest of the world) has become, moviegoers everywhere are still very conservative when it comes to retaining the image of an iconic character or a group of iconic characters. Would you use an African-American dwarf to play Superman in a new Superman film? I don't think so.I am not a misogynist and I really like movies with strong female leads but when movies are used to boost the liberal agenda of some minorities (gays, feminists, African-Americans, Latinos, etc.) that's when the magic of movies is lost.If you want to make film crap for some minorities, please don't use a respectable and well established film franchise like Ghostbusters. Make up your own franchise or franchises and fill them with gays, feminists, African-Americans, Latinos, etc.The aesthetics of a film is also important. While it is true that talented actors and actresses are important in a movie, obviously they must be good looking and (in some cases) young so the film looks nice. You wouldn't cast Robert De Niro as Peter Parker/Spider-Man no matter how talented De Niro is. It doesn't matter if De Niro is an award winning actor because he's simply not good for that role. One of the reasons the James Bond films are appealing is the hot women and it would be really stupid to cast Kristen Wigg or Melissa McCarthy as a bond girl. If the filmmakers made the decision of using an all-female lead cast, couldn't they at least have chosen young and beautiful women instead of fat old hags? Come on!!Stop ruining iconic characters and franchises with political correctness. Political correctness is a really stupid concept where people gets something valuable, not because they have earned with talent or skills, but because they belong to a minority that must not be ignored.Enough said!!!"
" Horrible
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,1,One of the worst movies made in the last 20 years ...plain and simple ...just trash.
" Nothing at all like the original
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,2,"There are very few movies that I stop watching out of disgust. But this is one of the very few...3 times in fact. The Comedy in this movie is fart jokes. FART jokes. Are you kidding me?? I waited 27 years ....They wrote this movie for idiots.The original film was a horror with comedic elements throughout, not scraping for a laugh every minute of the film! It had a serious tone and was scary with a brilliant score. This was written for a new generation that doesn't have an appreciation or attention span for well written adult comedy requiring an IQ above 10.Shame on the writers of this film for not trying harder to remain faithful to the comedic sensibilities of the original. I'm sure you were trying to please a younger modern audience, but I don't care. So thoroughly dissatisfied with this sole stain on an otherwise excellent franchise.I hate this film. I'm only giving it a two because I'm clearly biased by my feelings about the original and so maybe I'm being a bit harsh."
" Watched it 3 times, still don't find it funny or entertaining at all
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,1,"Ok, maybe I briefly chuckled once or twice this last time I watched it at whatever gadget Kate Mcwhatever character whipped up. But I was also skipping through a lot of this movie because it was just so unbearable. I can forgive the special effects, but I can't forgive the awful writing or the absurd amount of feminisming going on here.
Those involved in the movie said they wanted to ""make their own GB movie"", not a sequel, not a continuation. Congrats, you did make a stand alone movie, and it sucked. But I'm glad it is a stand alone that doesn't interfere with the original or GB3. Personally I'm just going to watch the originals and try to forget about GB 2016, Hollywood I hope you never forget it and learn from your mistake."
" Just didn't work
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,4,"Wanted to like this but alas it was not good. Big fan of Kristen Wiig but she looked like she didn't want to be there, she was phoning it in. The group just didnt work for me, no chemistry and the story was dull. Chris Hemsworth was the only really good thing about this, his himbo/air head receptionist was genuinely funny. I fell asleep before the end as it was dragging and I didn't bother going back to watch the last ten minutes as I didn't care."
" Not good
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,1,"This movie tried to hard to have one liners, not many were funny. This could have been good with the cast they had but the cast did not feed off each other and the jokes where forced. If the would have stuck to keeping it more realistic and close to what a ghostbusters 3 would be. The whole new story line didn't work."
" Entertaining and warm!
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,9,"Loved the movie, It bring me back the feelings of being a child, amazed by the fantasy and science of the Show!The characters are fun and interesting, you feel a connection, mostly on the second half.The action scenes and VFXs are also great.I would love to see a continuation."
" Not bad, but a little too long.
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie, but it was a little too long. I thought the acting was great. I loved the cameos. All of the ladies were believeabel and funny. And the special effects were cool. Overall, a good movie."
" Awful
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,3,I am a woman and a big fan of McCarthy but this is a poor movie. As other have noted it is not funny at all. In fact Wig and McCarthy generally I don't find too too funny. They have to be in the right scenario. But then there is a horrible sexist depiction of Chris Hemsworth's male Secretary that is just inexcusable. None of that was done in the original. The script is poor and overlong. Skip it.
" Worst Ghostbusters Movie ever!
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,2,"This movie version is just plain garbage!
There is just no other way to describe it. And the only reason i dared watching it, was because I could watch it on Netflix.It is not Funny, the cast is the worst of the worst (thoug I do love female casts for main roles, but not in this case) especially since they try to act like males and not only that, cause they try to copy the original.
It just doesn't work!Actually the only thing that kept me watching was the special effects (the reason I gave two stars). They were spot on.
But what it comes down to in the end, is that it just isn't worth to go into my movie collection, or to be rewatched at all!It would be way cooler to have the original cast (the still living ones) to do another one. In their age this could be way more interessting then a bunch of no names trying to be good actors!"
" Needed a Better Writer
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,5,"This could've been good. Hell, this could've been great. But instead, with the politically-charged writing and poor characters, this movie failed to impress. The CGI was solid, and the performances were great, but it all fell apart in the script. The only character that felt like an actual Ghostbuster was Kate McKinnon's character, Jillian Holtzmann. Sure, she was over-the-top at times and she might've seemed a bit... absent-minded, but she was a solid character that was fun to watch on screen. I can only hope she can get on board with the next entry in the franchise.
Of course, this movie saved itself with the third act. I was going to give it a much lower rating with the poor jokes and slow pacing, but the third act was genuinely entertaining. It wasn't enough to make this more than an average film, but it does keep it from being a truly bad one.
Overall, it doesn't ruin the franchise, but it'll be forgotten in a relatively short time."
" Disgrace
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,1,This film is so bad just watching the trailer makes you not want to see it
" Brilliant and modern special effects
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,5,"Brilliant and modern special effects can not hide the paleness of the plot. Stereotyped people, performances, long lines of self-talk, no waves of rhythm make the whole film seem extremely boring."
" Painful
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,2,Painfully unfunny. I'm not convinced there was an actual script since every scene is just people saying a bunch of unfunny bs.
" Slightly entertaining...
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,4,"...but in the same way when you are forced to watch your kids movie/show and they throw the occasional joke out for the parents in the crowd, the rest is boring nonsense.So I recently rewatched this movie in the hopes that somehow it got better. I thought maybe I was too hot headed with my last viewing (I was not happy what they did with my beloved franchise...MY FRANCHISE). But a second watch through years later didn't help.I think the actors were all pretty good, I have seen most of them in other things and have found them to be funny so I don't think it was the acting. I think it was mostly poor directing. The original was great because it had a kind of tension mixed with campyness and fun. There was a fine line between an 80's horror movie and and 80's comedy and the original was somewhere in between. This movie lacked any kind of tension or real horror. I will say the ghosts looked scarier but in an almost cartoon kind of way, I mean one of the ghosts that attack are a bunch of parade balloons...If this had been marketed as a movie for 7 year olds then yes it would have hit it's mark but thats not what the original was about and not what I think anyone was expecting of this movie.They could have written it in such a different way, maybe had it as a hand off from the old gaurd to the new, I mean they had all the original cast in the movie just not as themselves.The movie had such potential, it seems no one in Hollywood who makes movies is actually a fan of them these days as no one can reboot a franchise successfully."
" I don't get why there's so much hate for this movie!
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,9,"This movie is underrated! The cast is really good! The effects are cool! Everything about it is good! And yeah, it's not as good as the original 1984 film, but it is a pretty good movie all around!"
" This movie proves that great casts can never carry a bad script.
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,1,"The cast is amazing, but the writing is beyond awful. Inconsistent pacing, forced comedic moments, and a lack of character development makes this one not worth your time. Would have loved to have seen this cast in a Ghostbusters movie with a decent script."
" Just Like All The Commercials On TV
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,1,The women are bright and sparkly and smart and oh so tolerant of the stupid ditzy husband/man/boyfriend.What a cliche.Shame on all concerned (especially the so-called man in this film).
" this is why the avg test audience sucks
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,8,"Extended version is just way better (when the fun, and core parts of the whole concepts of the movies haven't been cut out.. (wonder why I'm suprised, since it's been seen before).. )"
" Not a good film
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,5,"Forget all the sexist hatred from trolls, this film is just a slap in the face to fans. The problem with the film overall is the lack of connection to the previous films, why not connect the film?
The cast is funny, but the film is poorly written and the plot falls apart. The studio threw a lot of money at this film. Why did they spend so much?"
" Destroying my childhood memories
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,4,"I did not enjoy this movie!!!!! I am the biggest Ghostbuster the original 1984 fan on the planet. I was crazy about the first 2 original Ghostbusters movies. I have seen them both probably 30 times.The humour in the original 2 Ghostbusters movies was brilliant, fun and original!!! I can honestly, honestly say I didn't laugh once while watching the new Ghostbusters reboot!!!! I give this new Ghostbusters a 4.7 and the original a 8.9 and Ghostbusters 2 a 8.3. Hollywood should have made a Ghostbusters 3 with the original cast in 2000 when they were still good-looking. I am so tired of bad movie reboots!!!!!!!! My motto is make brilliant sequels or 100%original movies. For example I'm dreaming of a good Gemlins 3 . But knowing Hollywood they will properly maker a horrible reboot of Gremlins like most of the times.There should be a law preventing people from making reboots. The original character Egon was fascinating to watch and Bill Murray was brilliant in the original Ghostbusters. If you're a fan of the original 2.Please don't watch this!!!!!"
" Dumpster fire
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,1,Why does this exist. It's a lazy comedy with ghostbusters slapped on it to sell tickets. I was almost expecting Adam Sandler to make a cameo. Seems up his alley
" Loved it!!!
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,9,I loved the humor in it and the cameos of the original Ghostbusters.
" Love it!!!
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,10,"I went in to watching this thinking it was going to be EXTREMELY man hating or something, but was pleasantly surprised!! Me and my husband laughed and just enjoyed it for what it is- a great watch:) I'm giving it 10 as so many people gave it a 1!! How could this get a 1? It was very well done"
" No
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,1,"No, just no. Gender equality is one thing, but to force this on a franchise that revolved around 4 guys blasting supernatural beings into the next dimension is an insult to the original."
" sexist
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,1,If you thought women were treated in a sexist fashion when the first ghost-busters was first released ? Why would you remake ghost-busters but then flip the script and be sexist towards men ? It seems that people feel the need for revenge rather than putting the situation right. Just for the record if something is wrong first time around if you repeat the mistake two wrongs dont make a right
" I saw the preview and that was enough
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,2,I watched this movie threw the reviews and im glad i didnt watch it .
" Total waste of time
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,1,"This film was absolutely horrible. How did this ever get released? It was more like a dumb high school drama skit with special effects, than a feature film. This whole movie was a bad SNL skit."
" If a could a would give this movie 0 this is how bad it is
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,1,Disrespect to original Ghostbusters movie and theyr cast
" Underrated!
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,8,"I honestly have no idea why people are panning this film!
Husband and I are big fans of the original Ghostbusters and thoroughly enjoyed this new take. It was refreshing to see strong female characters and a dopey male receptionist instead of the other way round!
The nods back to the 80's movie were brilliant, the new storyline was great and the ghosts - some of them frankly were pretty scary!
Definitely worth a watch! Shame some people can't get past women being the main hero's..."
" No surprise for me that this movie stinks
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,4,"Dont call on Sony to make a good remake
unfunny and lackluster
bad direction
bad villain
bad almost everything
ghosts and gadgets looked cool but thats all i can give this movie"
" Don't believe the crap reviews!
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,10,"This movie is more fun than the originals! Don't believe the crap everyone heaps on this movie, it's hilarious. The whole cast are hilarious. I'm not a fan of remakes but this was done well with ole ty of throwbacks for anyone nostalgic about the original movies. The irony of all the bad reviews is that it's referenced in the movie because they knew that people would try to rip it to pieces which is both hilarious and sad in itself."
" This movie is an insult to the Ghostbusters legacy
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,1,"This movie almost seems to be making fun of the original Ghostbusters., it should really just be forgotten. Wait what just happened? It was forgotten. Best day ever."
" Not a remake and barely a reboot!
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,10,If you don't like this movie it's probably best you thought it was going to have more connect to the last one. Or you strictly don't like it because of the female cast... Either way it's your lose!
" What a bore
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,1,"Wow, how does something this unfunny and tedious get made? How does something this unfunny get made? Seriously, forget about laughing - I can't even say that I smiled at all. Just nothing that broke even that thin ice. Sad because there was some talent both in front of the camera and behind.
I mean, didn't even one person look at this at any time and say yep, this is pretty awful. So let's make sure we crank up the uninspired desultory special effects and CGI?
Miss it if you can."
" The hate is unwarranted
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,6,"The original Ghostbusters is a very special movie to me as it was the first live action film I saw at the cinema but the fact it was handled by Paul Feig was enough to me to suggest it wouldn't be that bad and on the whole it isn't.
It's not perfect but who would be expecting to be perfect.
It has it's faults. There's an overuse of CGI, it's badly edited and I felt that more could have been gotten from the script. However, it's fun to watch, quite funny, the chemistry between the principels is good and a sequel wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.
Overall, it's worth a watch for a evening's entertainment."
" Horrible.. just horrible
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,1,"This movie has some of the worst acting and plot that I have ever seen. It's just unwatchable! What amazes me is that Bill Murray guest starred in this when he couldn't being himself to make part 3 with the original cast. Save yourself the 2 hours. Literally find anything else to do
Can't believe I wasted a good bag of gummy bears on this crappy movie"
" Did they want to defend the women's movement by making the worst movie in the history of cinema?
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,1,"The only thing that comes to mind is to be aggressive with absolutely everyone who participated in this abomination of the seventh art. Included the original cast and its cameos.
Its the worst movie among the worst.
I would be very embarrassed to have just done the catering for the crew team filming this garbage.I hope that Katie Dippold will never work again! And Paul Feig, I'm not surprised.Shame Sony, Shame Hollywood!"
" Politics Before Story.
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,3,"After the politically charge hype I didn't have much hope. When you sell social politics above story, the end product is inevitable. My fears were unfortunately confirmed. Average at best. Here's hoping for 2020."
" Absolute garbage
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,1,One of the worst movies I have ever tried to watch. I couldn't make it to the end because of how stupid and awful this movie is. Really ruined the Ghostbusters name for ever!
" oh my what have we got into our selves into
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,1,So firstly replacing a set of male actors with female actors was a bad idea I mean they pretty much was at a dead line here. the acting went way below standards because of this. and the writing is no better. the jokes are not even there is just filled with the unoriginal farts. the characters are awful just awful they talk for a full 2 minutes in the film with nothing happening. and the pilot is so boring and lagged that it makes the whole thing longer. lets see if they ever make a 2nd sequel.
" an awful pile of crap.
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,1,"Why the people of the film industry spend time and money to make this kind of crap, instead of giving continuity to a solid story already told? that's the question of the 100000000 bucks! Stay away from this, as if were the plague."
" Have You Watched The Commercials on TV?
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,2,"This is that extended to 90 minutes. it is a glorified detergent commercial.You know how it goes. Smart and clever woman shows up to roll her eyes and snap her fingers at the idiotic and bumbling husband/man.Yes, the lying, sexist, oh so modern (sarcasm) standard is put to a movie here by a whipped studio hack (they call 'him' director.)Now let us get real. Here is what i want in a movie: pretty flaunting super thin babes with both exposed thighs and cleavage. If it is a comedy I want to laugh. If it is a horror I want to be scared or thrilled.
When your film has none of these elements then I am uninterested and will not drive myself or anyone else to the cinema. Kapisch? No? Then you do not see my money, carry on.Look closely at the ghosts in this film. They look rudderless and bored. Then look at the original Ghostbusters. Sigourney Weaver was an eye candy I could fantasize about. She had it and she flaunted it.Factual review has ended. Downvote away."
" Without Charm, Wit or Humour.
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,5,"A re-imagining lacking in style, flavour or a coherent plot. Character motivation is vague and nonsensical. An excellent cast is underutilized. The first Ghostbusters was both a comedy and a horror film. This version is neither."
" a wasted opportunity
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,1,"This film could have been so good but they ruined it and the chance for a good reboot with horrible comedy, horrible storytelling and sexism/racism towards men and white people. it basically feels like a parody insulting the originals. literally the only part that made me laugh was when the chris hemsworth character said "" an aquarium is a submarine for fish"" which is not even funny i just kind of laughed ironically. the visuals and effects were great and it made me sad because with an actual good script and cast that was respectful to the originals and audience this could have been such a good movie or trilogy. but no political statements and 5 year old comedy has to ruin it"
" Funnier than the first one
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,Excellent remake that takes a core premise and brand and puts it's own spin on it. I thought this had more laughs than the original and more charm. Really hoping they make the sequel
" Entertaining film to while the time away
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,8,"I had a good time watching this film and found it pretty entertaining, silly, not deep, no worries and loads of fun. A typical popcorn movie.
I felt there was chemistry between the ladies with Kristen Wiig having the meatiest role though not much of it. The special effects and situations our heroines find themselves in are over the top, but this is very much in tone with the spirit of the film. A comedy which kept a continuous smile on my face (though no guffaws)."
" Should not have a 74% on Rotten Tomatoes
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,3,"This movie has a higher rating on RT than Forrest Gump and that makes me angry because Forrest Gump is a phenomenal, amazing movie and this film is just not good at all. It also has a higher rating than Ghostbusters II which has a 53% on there and it's a way better movie than this crap. The fact that it's fresh on Rotten Tomatoes made me lose faith in the site."
" Feministic pile of garbage
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,1,"Full of hate against males and unfunny humor, the chronically frustrated neo liberalistic feminists took a well established franchised stuffed it with liberal lies and man hating propaganda killing it in the process.
oh did i mentioned the ghost busters are all unfunny panicking females now ?
acting: bad, directing: full of hate against males and also bad.
Reminds me of some cheap soap you see on comedy central."
" Who You Gonna Call? No One...
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,5,"Who you gonna call? I have no idea anymore... When the 1st Ghostbusters film hit the cinemas all the way in 1984, the film was always known for its one liners and clever jokes, but don't forget that many found the original Ghostbuster very frighting and scary.In 1989 Ghostbusters 2 finally surfaced but as you expect, it was no match for the 1st film. Many claimed that the plot for the 2nd film was a big drawback.27 years passed by in which there was always talk of a 3rd film with the key actors returning or even discussions on a new male cast to takeover.When the announcement finally came to the world that Paul Feig (director of The Heat, Spy & Bridesmaids) would be not only directing, but also changing the gender and direction of Ghostbusters the world went a little mad and crazy.Going into the film I personally didn't have any hate towards the film or major concerns. The director has made some successful comedy films but also the four leads for this reboot are in fact four very talented ladies.The films starts with a ghost invasion which shortly introduces us to the new paranormal enthusiasts Erin, Abby, Jillian who are excited to investigate their real 1st experience they have always waited and prepared for.With more and more paranormal sightings occurring our heroes see an opportunity to rise up and help the city. Joining the team is also our 4th Ghostbuster ""Patty"" and the Ghostbusters reception Kevin (Christ Hemsworth aka my twin brother lol)In no way shape or form does this film acknowledge the previous Ghostbusters films or its characters. This film is simply a reboot. Those who know the previous Ghostbusters films, we are graced with a number of hidden appearances from the original Ghostbuster actors (I counted 5 of them). While some of the appearances are fun (I get it) they could have been used in a very creative way instead of just randomly popping up...What do I think of our new Ghostbusters crew? Well, as we've seen already in many films we have the same actresses pulling out really poor, cheesy jokes. Sometimes the jokes just do not work and the joke goes on and on- like the Ghostbuster who always gets slimed on or always steps on slime, or the Ghostbuster who continuously receives her take out order incorrectly and argues with the delivery man many time. The worst joke in the film is when someone says the phrase ""Let the cat out of the bag"" only to have the film divert into two Ghostbuster questioning how it's even possible. The jokes fall flat to the point the film might as well be called something else. Most of the film's humour is brilliantly delivered by Kevin (Chris Hemsworth); the man who doesn't have glass in his glasses simply because he got sick and tired of cleaning the glass. Funny, but still very cheesy.
While a viewer may expect that when a scary ghost appears people would be worried or freak out, when these Ghostbusters see a scary Ghost you can expect poor jokes as they just stand still instead of running or worse- a Ghostbuster deciding to eat Pringles while watching her friend talk to a Ghost.
Being scared of Ghosts and adding perfectly well time humour is something the previous films did really well. It's no surprise that this reboot had big shoes to fill.Some viewers do not like the idea of the male characters in this film being either mean or incredible dumb (worse than Homer Simpson kinda Dumb). This really didn't get me down during the film.The film's plot and main villain is also forgettable. The film also tries to introduce new creative weapons (instead of the classic trap) to the point that our heroes are distorting
Ghosts, not capturing them.Be sure you stay for the end credits (very rewarding).4.9/10

" A comedy should be funny.
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,1,A comedy should be funny this is not funny thus it's a failure from the outset. It doesn't ruin the original or anything hyperbolic like that. But the fact that it's a different take on an all time classic comedy just emphases how much it falls short of being funny or even entertaining.
" A lot better than I expected
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,8,I loved the original Ghost Busters and I was put of watching this for a long time due to peoples opinions and bad reviews. But it was on the TV so thought I would give it a go and I am pleased I did.I loved the little throw backs to the original like when they tried to rent the fire station but could not afford the rent and of course all the cameo appearances from some of the original cast.Yeah a re-make is never usually going to be better than the original and this was not it was different and a lot of fun. Don't watch it with any prejudice or comparison to the original and you'll enjoy it
" One of the worst films you can watch
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,1,"This film has already been parodied to death by south Park, redlettermedia, honest trailer, nostalgia critic and internet personalities by how terrible it is so I'm going to try and not repeat any of the usual criticisms. There are no chemistry in cast, the dated and repetitive jokes don't work, the visual effects look like a Scooby doo knock off, the cameos from the original are poorly used, the villian is forgettable, the writing/plot should have been looked at again. The fans hated it, the audience didn't like it, the critics are mixed. I don't know whom this movies was for but it wasn't meant for dedicated fans and the obvious backlash condemned which made it bomb at the box office and become a joke as a movie."
" Absolutely awful
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,1,Loved the original. Didn't laugh at this one once despite lighter moments provided by the excellent Chris Hemsworth.
" Enjoyable, fun film.
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't expecting much - all the negativity surrounding this film and pettiness had had an impact. However I was pleasantly surprised to see a funny, piquant and enjoyable film that can be watched by all the family. My husband, brother and niece all had a blast watching the film, and I really liked all the references and cameos from previous stars in the series. So I hope people enjoy the movie, take it as it is, a witty tribute to the previous movies, with an enjoyable take on who the Ghostbusters could be. Highly recommended!"
" An unnecessary reboot with a half-baked plot
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,4,"Is this new Ghostbusters the worst movie in the world? No. Is it good? Also, no. To be honest, it's not as bad as I expected it to be, but it's an unnecessary reboot with a half-baked plot and a bunch of half-hearted jokes that don't really land. Kristen Wiig does fine, but Kate McKinnon's talents are almost entirely wasted. This feels like a fan-made movie -- full of cool special effects, but no real substance."
" Astonishingly poor remake!

" Fun, daft and nice nods to the original.
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,7,"Didn't catch this at the cinema when it came out but just watched it on TV with my girlfriend. Yes, it's daft, but it's great fun and acknowledges the original here and there. We both thoroughly enjoyed it, and would be keen to watch a sequel."
" Sharp female comic camaraderie, tons of slime...
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,8,".... A dense hunk male 'secretary' still learning to use the phone, wicked black New York seen-it-all humour, eighties tropes everywhere - what's not to like?! I've seen way too many hater reviews that I fear are driven in varying amounts by misogyny that I suggest if you find this fun give it a good 10/10 and try and fix this jaundiced rating! The chemistry between these fine comic actors is up there with the best male performers. The movie has a smart tongue-in-cheek vibe that makes it clear it doesn't take itself too seriously, and that the bit I think the rednecks don't get. It's not an attempt at a facsimile of the great originals, but I swear it's got the fun and nihilistic mood of the original pinned down. I only wish there was more ghostbuster banter and hijinks and less bloody ghosts personally but saying that the special effects worked out OK. I do hope we see more of this oestrogen- charged heroic crew in action - how about taking out slime-spitting zombie-sexist reviewers with proton ray guns - that would be fun."
" Jobs for the ladettes?
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,1,"This was just awful. Maybe, if women want to be taken seriously in the film industry, they should try coming up with original characters and stories, and not just lever off what others have done before them. Spend less time harping on gender politics, and more time working on your craft, then maybe you'll be able to produce a decent movie.Don't bother with this travesty."
" A Bad Idea & A Unnecessary Remake
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,1,When this was 1st announced I thought to myself what a stupid idea. I didn't even want to pay to watch it. I was even debating whether to watch it at allNow I've finally watched it after it had its terrestrial premiere on Channel 4 in the UK. Wished I hadn't.10 minutes in I knew it was going to be poor. And I was not wrong. 2 hours of dross. How the hell it cost $144m to make I will never know.Not even a scratch on the original. Or even the 2nd Ghostbusters. I did not laugh once during the whole unfunny 2 hours. And what the hell was the Dance routine at the end. A pointless pointless remakeI would not even bother watching it. Just stick to the originals if you want to watch a Ghostbusters film. Even the cartoons would be better. I pray to god that they don't make anymore of these.S**t
" Dreadful and pointless
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,1,"Who thought this would be worth funding? Same story badly done with all the charm of a rattlesnake. Worst script we've witnessed in years. The acting was appalling. Why did it launch Chris Helmsworths Hollywood career, apart from looking good, he was awful. I wouldn't worry about spoilers whoever signed the cheque for this needs sacking."
" Painful
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,1,Any fans of the original Ghostbusters movies should just avoid this one all together. The actors are terrible!
" It's not that bad! By a ghostbusters fan!
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,5,"The issue with the film is that it tries to hard to be its own film yet stealing parts of the first two films! If you haven't seen the first two films you could probably sit with your kids & enjoy it! In regards to whether the film has intention to fuel the issue of gender equality, I think the film was released maybe too late to make any sort of positive contribution when there's a lot more greater role models out there for women in reality & I thought it was generally poor taste to add a african American to the top casting (no offence to the actress as she played her role well) but yes Ernie Hudson was in the earlier films however it was a different society we lived in then! If it was equal opportunities they were after, why couldn't they have added mr chow (hangover films) as the extra ghost buster. Overall I think if it was treated as a direct sequel & with a better script, I think this film could have done a lot better!"
" Lazy
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,1,"Once the definitive movie has stood the test of time, built up a sizeable fan base with a soundtrack that just won't quit, why the HELL would anyone want to remake it with an unremarkable cast with an infantile script ? Absolutely woeful"
" Children's Movie

" Everyone tryed to be the funny one
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,3,"You can't have a movie where every character is the funny comedic relief, it just leads to no one being funny at all. It also has moments where it leaves the plot behind just to try to be funny, it never is."
" Trash
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,1,"Remake an average movie, replace the male characters with female ones for no good reason and what do you get...TRASH"
" Really good reboot
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this film, good special effects and funny characters (especially Chris Hemsworth).
Can't understand all the bad reviews.
And a really nice touch having all the cameos.
I'm hoping they make a sequel."
" Fantastic.
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,1,"Wow, what a grat movie. The originality, the acting, the dialogue, wow.. This movie really would make me soo proud if I was a woman.. Just fantastic."
" Not good...
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,5,"""Ghostbusters"" is a Comedy - Fantasy movie in which we watch a group of four women trying to stop a ghost invasion in Manhattan. The group was made up from two paranormal enthusiasts, a nuclear engineer, and a subway worker who will have to try their best in order to first capture all the ghosts that are free in Manhattan and second to secure them to a safe location.I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie but I was a bit disappointed by it after watching it. Since I had already watched the previous two movies of ""Ghostbusters"" I unconsciously compared them to this new movie and as you can understand the outcome wasn't good. Despite the silly jokes which I didn't find funny at all and the idiotic interpretation that Chris Hemsworth had to make I believe that the direction which was made by Paul Feig wasn't that bad and if he just changed some small thing it would be better. The only interpretation that I really enjoyed in this movie was Kate McKinnon's who played as Jillian Holtzmann and she really good at it.In conclusion, I have to say that ""Ghostbusters"" isn't the best movie to watch except if you are watching it with your children, then I am sure that they are going to love it. To be honest I don't recommend this movie to anyone and let me say that if you have already watched the previous ""Ghostbusters"" movies then just rewatch them, it will be far better than watching this movie."
" Ghostbusters (2016) : A Paul Feig style reboot for the franchise
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,7,"Now this is a gamble, building a most loved film franchise from the old generation for the future generation with a director's own film making style.This gamble was the reason for the global criticism for this film as well.Though that's the case, I personally love Paul Feig films. The Heat (2013) and Spy (2015) was amazing.And this also is an amazing comedy with Paul Feig's comic charms and quirks.I agree this does not live upto the standard of the older films but still a really good film when you filter it with the Paul Feig perspective.Overall - 3.5/5"
" A ""horror comedy"" without the horror or the comedy.
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,2,"There's all sorts of things wrong with this movie but it has nothing to do with the cast of the Ghostbusters being women.... Well OK, it has a little to do with it, but not for the reasons one would think.The main problem comes down to the puerile, low-brow, and painful attempts at humour. This would be bad enough as they were - if the jokes weren't made by fully grown women. I don't know about other people, but it's typically little boys who tell these sorts of jokes, and in THAT context it could have been funny. In this context - I'm sorry - it just isn't at all. It comes off as awkward and sad and not funny in the slightest. Chris Hemsworth has perhaps the funniest line in the film, and perhaps the only funny line in the film, and it's because he's a man that the joke works.Secondly, there is no real horror in this film. If you're going to have a ghosts, there needs to be horror that needs to be somewhat believable. Here, we've got something akin to ""Goosebumps"" and ""Scary Movie"" horror with blatant CGI overkill. In other words it's not genuinely creepy or scary at all, and it doesn't take itself even remotely seriously. The ghosts in this movie do not pose a genuine threat. This means that the levity of comedy - even if the attempts at humor here were even slightly funny - would have had absolutely no impact regardless.Thirdly, this film takes a huge dump all over it's classic source material. It's the most cynical cash grab imaginable to even attempt a ""remake"" and then go ahead and make something worse, throwing out all the lore of the original films as if they never existed. The director does not even seem to fully understand what made the original film work as well as it did. There are cameos by some of the original cast members, but they are all completely wasted. Bill Murray was the best thing about the original 1984 film and his talents go completely unused in his cameo here.Even with some decent plot ideas, there's no saving it from being pointless. It's aimed at an idiotic audience who would find Friedberg and Seltzer movies funny. In fact this film has little to no redeeming features to even be worth watching. There's not even any decent music.It's a horror comedy, without the hyphen."
" Abysmal
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,1,"Complete waste of time, in no way is this even a Ghostbusters film, it could be any below average comedy that the majority of these actors/directors make. Stop ruining classics and take your man hating elsewhere."
" Disgraceful
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a disgrace to a pop culture legend. Don't mess with a masterpiece. Choppy mess of a movie that tried too hard to be funny, just like the new Saturday night live. Horrible money grab of a catastrophe."
" Misplaced and mis-marketed
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,3,"I wanted to like the movie. I adore Kate McKinnon in over the top characters, and Kristen Wiig has genuine talent. The movie is a cinematic platitude.Two things that might have saved this:1) If this was a true passing of the torch. The surviving original cast in new roles felt tacked on. Useless. If they had played their old characters and somehow worked into the plot, I would have respected that.2) Use a time machine and make the original Ivan Reitman production disappear. As a standalone movie, it's ok. The story line is decent and the characters are likable. It just can't stand up to the original."
" Amazingly good!!!
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,10,"After reading so many bad reviews I was in doubt of seeing this movie. But I'm so glad I did, it's exiting funny and awesome! Great cast ^^ better than the other Ghostbusters movies."
" Loved it
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,6,"Why do people hate this movie? I'm all for nostalgia but these ladies rocked it. The fact that Akroyd, Murray and Hudson made cameos shows their support. Take another look, this is a great movie!"
" Loved it
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,"Funny and hugely entertaining, some fun call backs to the original while being its own movie.If you're looking for an enjoyable movie that doesn't take itself too seriously try this one.However, if you're looking for a direct remake of the 80s one don't bother."
" On the positive side.
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,1,"Nice colours.
To bad because i really had high hopes for this remake.
Now,after seeing it,i can only ask,
why..??"
" great by a feminist perspective
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,1,Review: I was disappointed with this movie because I expected a lot more from a ghostbusters reboot. The direction and screenplay are disappointing. Both the casting and acting are disappointing also. All in all I would give this one out of a possible five stars.
" Terrible Remake
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,4,"Stick to the original film. This remake is terrible. With the talent starring in the film, this should be very entertaining. Instead, it is lame, lame and lame."
" Garbage, spend your time relaxing your tennis shoes instead of watching.
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,1,"I typically enjoy Melissa McCarthy movies. I did not enjoy this one. Absolute garbage from start to finish. The writing is forced and mediocre, the acting is uninspired and mediocre. The best parts of the movie we're the cameos from the original movies."
" SNL related films have sucked for years
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,3,"And this is not different. I am unswayed funniness and comedy have become a lost art in films, but it has and so we have to return to older films for rewatching.however this does not mean the studios have to clone the older movies to weak effect. By the way, Sigourney was babe in the original. There is no equivalent here."
" Perfectly fine dumb comedy
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,7,"Let's all take a breath on the Ghostbusters movies. They are all pretty dumb, with GB2 being the dumbest of the three. This one, which should be GB3, is a serviceable comedy with a great cast. All of the principals in this one are great in their roles, the special effects have been dialed up to meet early 21sr C. standards, and much CGI ectoplasm is flung about. The strangest thing is that, somehow, the original is now considered a classic for some reason. It wasn't and isn't. It's just a dumb comedy, just like this one.
Watch this one and enjoy it. It is a perfectly fine dumb comedy."
" I'm just sorry the reviews kept me from watching it sooner!
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,10,"The movie was fantastic. Acting was on point, the ensemble was spectacular, the special effects, script and transition work was fantastic. Lots of novel humor, mixed with exciting high action scenes.The reviews kept me from watching it, and now knowing how skewed the reviews were (google it), I will never again let reviews keep me from watching a movie that I've been wanting to see."
" Some funny scenes, but not as good as the original
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,7,"This movie has same VERY funny scenes but this is a good example of a sequel that should not have been made because, really, who can top the original?The problem with Hollywood is that it is run by people who only care about making money and easier to copy an earlier film than do something new and creative."
" I liked it!
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,7,"I'm a fan of the ghostbusters and I couldn't not watch this reboot. People may hate me for this but... I enjoyed this movie. I'm so impressed to see how many people strongly hated it. In my humbly opinion, the movie successfully recreates the magic, the fun and also the atmosphere of the original back in 1984. The choice to replace the main male protagonist with female ones sounded controversial to me but I was surprised to see how the four female protagonists standed up well eith their good performances and humor. Only 2 things I hated in this movie: 1-Chris Hemsworth's character's Kevin Beckman (he's way too dumb. Only few of his jokes are funny). 2- The too many references to the original movie (even the story can be too familiar with the first movie). The visuals are very interesting but not as spooky as the original movie, and the action sequences are very well directed. The humor is solid but sometimes is fleeble. Many jokes and gags are funny and family-friendly, othe jokes are weak, dirt and some other even sexist. Personally I wouldn't disagree a sequel.Final verdict 7/10 (Good)!Ghostbusters 2016 may not be as funny, as witty or as spooky as the original, but it's a fun and enjoyable movie and I can personally reccomend to everyone!"
" Way better than I expected
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,4,"I was told that this was the worst movie ever made and how absolutely horrible it was. Why?it is fine, not awesome nor gut busting helarious but not bad at all. It may take a beer or two but it is funny and even feels like a Ghostbusters movie despite several missed opportunities. It was a fun movie"
" Don't listen to the broflakes.
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,8,"I dont know what movie the other reviewers were watching, but it wasnt the same one I saw apparently. The movie that i saw and have watched 3 or 4 times now was wonderful. It wasnt perfect, but it was far from terrible or even mediocre. It is not the old Ghostbusters, but with women, so if you were hoping for that, I guess you would be disappointed. What it is though, is a funny and entertaining reinvention of the original film. There is no Peter Venkman here and no Gozer level antagonist. Instead we get 4 very funny, very capable women, fighting one very angry, but very smart man, who is more than capable of wreaking havoc on New York City. The dialogue is fantastic, the chemistry between characters is on point, the ghosts are fun and cool to look at, and the story is adventurous. What more could you ask for in a Ghostbusters?"
" May be better than the original.
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,8,"Don't understand the hate on this one, except when so many are claiming an agenda that doesn't exist, it seems it says more about them than the movie. I laughed my tail off, and all the women (especially Kate) did a wonderful job. It's a comedy remake, and if judged solely on that it excels. I've seen ""man hating,"" ""feminist propaganda,"" and similar terms, from small people who didn't give the movie a chance. Just sit back, and watch it, and you'll enjoy it. Murray's dry wit in the original probably gives it the edge, barely, but this is certainly in the same league."
" Just no.
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,1,This movie made me want to hurt others and then myself.
" I love this movie!
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,10,"Girl power and ghosts? Throw in Kevin, and yep. I'm sold! I laughed harder at this, than the original. I thought it was well written, and the gags and in jokes were hilarious. The special effects were awesome. Just a great movie!"
" I Didn't Last 10 Minutes
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,1,"Full Disclosure - I had 0 interest in watching this movie. I thought it looked terrible when it hit theaters and had no plans of ever seeing it.So here I am, home alone on a Monday and I just can't find anything interesting on tv. Scrolling through my guide, I see Ghostbusters. So I go to that channel and figure maybe this movie will at least serve as adequate background noise while I browse the web or something.Nope. Melissa McCarthy is one of the least funny people in the world. I feel like every movie I see her in, she's just doing really bad Chris Farley impressions and her voice makes me want to stab my ear drums with a rusty corkscrew.Within 10 minutes I had enough. Everyone associated with the making of this movie owes the world an apology."
" Will someone please shout ""CUT""!?
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,2,"It took me quite a while to watch this movie. Not because of the whole ""female"" non-controversy, but because I was getting really sick and tired of re-boots and re-makes of movies that were already good.
Now that I finally watched it, I have to say that this is a contender for worst re-boot/re-make I have ever had the misfortune of watching. Ghostbusters 2016 seems to have completely missed the point of what made the original work.
What on earth made Paul Feig believe that it would be fun to have everyone act like cartoon characters, is simply beyond me. Add to that incredibly cringy add-lipping, jokes so childish you would think it was made with kindergarteners in mind (some of which are repeated ad nausea) , a plot that has little to no resonance at all, and constant, unending talking making even scenes that could have been atmospheric and somewhat creepy (the animated mannequin doll) falling flat on their face.
With all the talking, jokes, dumb guy covering his eyes when he hears a loud noise, dancing, shouting, woo-hooing, etc. etc. etc. Ghostbusters 2016 is like a 5-year old jumping around on the bed screaming at the top of his lungs, ""LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME!"" in its utter desperation for getting laughs. That desperation was the only laughs the movie got from me, as I could not believe the depths they were willing to sink to - and then actually repeat them.
It's a movie completely devoid of direction, atmosphere, charm, and most importantly humour.
I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. Watch the originals instead!"
" Ghost of a chance
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,8,"It's funny and good to see the nods to the prior GB movies. Please don't expect a movie that takes itself seriously. The actors have good chemistry seem to have fun making it. Shame Rick Moranis didn't make a cameo. SFX were cool. Chris Helmsworth dancing, definitely!"
" I wouldn't watch this cra*
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,1,"Didn't see this, won't watch it, felt it necessary to score it on the basis that the premise is B.S.... also melissa mccarthy and Kate McKinnon.... awful"
" UGH! It's just one long LONG SNL sketch...
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,1,"It took 47 minutes before they even started the ""Ghostbusters"" business. That's after really really looooooong drawn out ""jokes"" that they even explained. It's like watching a SNL sketch that really should have ended one minute after it started, but an hour later it's still going on. (and I like SNL, too...)I'm not even sure what they were attempting with this movie. To make us laugh? To make a new generation love the Ghostbusters franchise? They failed miserably at both of those. Ghostbusters II was an amazing Oscar award winning movie in comparison to this flick - and that's really saying something...Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Not even worth the free rental from Netflix. I want the time back from my life this movie just stole.At least Chris Hensworth was funny the few moments he was on the screen. He was the ONLY entertaining value of this film."
" Ghosts
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,6,An average movie with couple jokes wasn't so bad as everyone literally saying.
" BRING ME THANOS!!!
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,4,OOPS WRONG MOVIE.There really isn't much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said.This movie was not boring. But this Movie was kinda lame. We all knew it would and it did.I mean its not that bad because I was able to sit through the whole thing but this movie just isn't good.The acting is surprisingly good. The CGI and effects were good.I felt the Cameos from the original Ghostbusters took away any seriousness from the movie.Chris Hemsworth aka Thor was the highlight of the whole movie.Other than that this movie is what we expected. And THEY won't stop making such movies.
" unimaginative
",2018-10-10 00:00:00,1,"My expectations were low and having watched the film it is evident they were still too high! With so many VOD platforms out there Hollywood is treading a very thin ice with dross like this. Please stop, you will kill cinema! For us hardworking folk out in the big wide world it is a big expense to part with our money at the cinema box office these days. THINK HOLLYWOOD... THINK!"
" Perfect? No. But loads of fun, yes.
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,7,"Very fun reboot of the series. Loved the chemistry of Kristin, Melissa, Leslie, and Kate. Chris Hemsworth's character was definitely silly and probably sillier than necessary, but he seemed to be having a good time. 
Enjoyed the jabs to the internet troll haters. Some great one-liners. But even more than that I really loved all the nods to the original, including the cameos. Definitely watch all the way through. 
Have watched it three times now and enjoyed it each time."
" It's okay. Standard run of the mill Hollywood comedy
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,5,"It's average. It's not bad, but not good. There really isnt any originality in the type of comedy this movie goes for, just sort of generic jokes you could see in any average comedy. The effects are very good! The ghosts are very cool and glowy. Would I watch it again? Maybe as background noise while talking to some friends?"
" Thought this was great
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,8,"The ladies are hilarious. The ghost busting is great. Great support cast. People seem to romantize the original movie like it was some great cinematic masterpiece. (It was hilarious, still watch it yearly. But let's not forget the fart jokes ) but I'm adding this to the rotation of movies I can watch multiple times. Boys, you're still pretty, get over yourselves."
" Oh dear.....
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,1,Shocking... just shocking. Why would anyone think this film remake was a good idea? Ghostbusters is a classic... this is an embarrassment to the film industry
" Who was this movie made for?
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,4,"Great supporting cast, check. SNL alumini in the lead roles as per the originals, check. So what went wrong? Summary: 'The Heat' and 'Spy' meets 'Scooby-Doo'. Something nobody asked for, ever. Fails on all fronts as a 'Ghostbusters' movie. Not-specific-to-plot spoilers ahead.The initial backlash against this movie was ugly and predictable. It recieved furious ire for its all female cast (Bill Murray's idea in a throwaway interview comment). But then came damn near offensive cash-grab trailers, stating '30 years later' as if it was a sequel, not a reboot. You can't really hold Paul Feig responsible, that kind of playing it safe has 'studio intereference' written all over it.The act of totally rebooting Ghostbusters, imho, IS the first issue. If you're starting a franchise new, you best make damn sure you got the chops to back it up. The script of Ghostbusters: ATC does not have the chops. It's Paul Feig-level snappy, sure. The jokes are focussed, well delivered and occasionally quite funny. However there's glaring pacing issues. Our heroes suddenly jump from four newly unemployed nobodies who have an idea, a building, a hearse and some experimental equipment that they've salvaged from their university jobs, to their first ghostbusting job, which they suddenly roll up in a fully customised Ecto-1, equipped with uniforms and FOUR fully developed proton packs. This is like 10 seconds later (actual time, not film time). This, again, could be studio interference, but there are plenty of examples of lazy writing in the movie to make one uncertain.Paul Feig has claimed to care very deeply about this film, but it's obvious that he cares very little for Ghostbusters, even going so far as to throw Bull Murray's cameo character out of window, killing him. In a better film, this could have been a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek moment.In THIS film, where Proton Packs are guns, not conductive wands, the ghosts have a brightly coloured glow about them, a la the Scooby Doo movies and one of the ghosts is an actual, honest to goodness dragon - you've got to wonder about the processes that he took in making a Ghostbusters that fans would actually be able to recognise. Paul Feig didn't bother. Had he bothered, it might have countered the violent reaction that so many 'fans' had, and often have, to the inevitable growth and change in a franchise.Also, there's a matinee in the background of one scene advertising ""Bruce Lee's Fists of Fury"". FISTS of Fury? Seriously?And when you have a comedy actor in their prime like Kate McKinnon on your books, is there any need to dress her in funny goggles and give her a funny voice. Her character was jarring to watch, as was Chris Hemsworth's. Perfect examples of comedy for people who repeatedly post Minion memes on Facebook and eat exclusively chicken dippers because they're 'fussy about food'.Final negative point, the music is just truly disgusting. The remade theme tune, the live band in the film, the score/OST itself, all deserve to be recategorised into a new genre: sub-music. On the plus side, Slimer looks great, Leslie Jones nails the ""everyman"" role, literally EVERYONE from the originals returns in some form or another, Andy Garcia is hilarious as the useless mayor, and some of it, particularly the opening and the third act, IS spooky fun, just not Ghostbusters spooky fun."
" Terrible!
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,1,I actually gave this a chance after seeing the awful trailer but I thought 'it's just a trailer' but this film is just as bad just watch the original! It's 1000 times funnier and 1000 times better. Watching this is literally wasting 116 minutes of your life.
" To not-so-Boldly go where Man has gone Before
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,4,"I have a bias against this new ""Ghostbusters"" that I'll admit, and it's not some stupid sexist one, or a general hatred of reboots/remakes/reworkings, but it's that I never cared too much for the silly comedy of the 1984 original, either, let alone its lackluster sequel. And nostalgia for the boys-club version is one of the main appeals this 2016 girl-power iteration makes. After a slow start involving Professor Gilbert's (Kristen Wiig) tenure and the resurfacing of a book she co-authored in the past with former pal Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy), which I couldn't care less about, setting up the rekindling of their friendship (again, uninteresting), followed by the usual and lengthy science-y mumbo-jumbo, which I suppose seems to be required for the spectator to buy into the ""ghosts are real"" narrative (although it surely could've done without resorting to the maps being in alignment, couldn't it have?), the pacing thereafter actually isn't bad. Albeit, this latter part is full of references to the 1980s films, which tend to be inconsequential to the plot--cameos, logos and quotations of specific scenes, sets, ghost characters, theme music and lines--and CGI action sequences and an after-credits setup for a sequel that are more in the spirit of MCU-inspired franchise building than to the original ""Ghostbusters"" films.Appropriately, given that the women ghostbusters shoot, punch and sling their energy-stream laser things like lightning bolts from Thor's hammer, the movie casts the MCU's Thor, Chris Hemsworth, in the reverse-gendered role of the bimbo, as well as the damsel-in-distress. The 1980s films had at least a few of these types, too, except they tended to be women. The 1984 film also had a strange anti-EPA plotline, and the sequel lampooned government, as well; here, this is watered down to a generic government cover-up conspiracy. Additionally, I can live without the ghost fellatio and the crossing of streams that wouldn't have had the same resonance with a female cast, although I do think the paraphilia and homoeroticism are what make the 1984 film interesting (I grant that this is not a mainstream interpretation). Otherwise, the best part of the original films was Bill Murray's wisecracking. He was kind of like the guys from Mystery Science Theater 3000, riffing on how ludicrous everything in the film is, except he was a character in it. This 2016 alternate world lacks that, and much of the humor is more slapstick based. Plus, Wiig and McCarthy aren't half as delightful as they were in ""Bridesmaids"" (2011). Kate McKinnon is the standout; she has a distinctive voice, and her mechanic is entirely wacky. Too bad the rest of the movie is an uneven and uninspired retread."
" A COMPLETE DISGRACE TO THE GHOSTBUSTERS CINEMATIC LEGACY
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,1,"My Goodness. Where do I begin?I think it is fair to say that political correctness was the kiss of death for this GHOSTBUSTERS remake/reboot. It amazes me, how Hollywood doesn't learn its lesson regarding political correctness. No matter how liberal America (and the rest of the world) has become, moviegoers everywhere are still very conservative when it comes to retaining the image of an iconic character or a group of iconic characters. Would you use an African-American dwarf to play Superman in a new Superman film? I don't think so. I am not a misogynist and I really like movies with strong female leads but when movies are used to boost the liberal agenda of some minorities (feminists, african-americans, latinos, etc.) that's when the magic of movies is lost. If you want to make film crap for some minorities, do it, but please don't use a respectable and well established film franchise like Ghostbusters. Make up your own franchise or franchises and fill them with feminists, African-Americans, Latinos, etc. Is that too much to ask?The aesthetics of a film is also important. While it is true that talented actors and actresses are essential in a blockbuster film, obviously they must be good looking and (in some cases) young, so the film looks nice. You wouldn't cast Robert De Niro as Peter Parker/Spider-Man no matter how talented De Niro is. It doesn't matter if De Niro is an Academy award winning actor because he's simply not good for that role. One of the reasons the James Bond films are appealing is the hot women and it would be really stupid to cast Kristen Wigg or Melissa McCarthy as a Bond girl. If the filmmakers made the decision of using an all-female lead cast, couldn't they at least have chosen young and beautiful women instead of fat old hags? Come on!!Regarding the movie itself I can say it's a boring movie, unlike the first two films it doesn't have interesting characters with charisma and it doesn't bring many new ideas to the Ghostbuster cinematic legacy. Even Dan Aykroyd didn't have good things to say about the way Paul Feig handled this beloved franchise. I guess we won't see another GHOSTBUSTERS movie in a long time and it's pretty obvious now that Paul Feig won't never, ever, be given another big budget franchise. He should stick to his mediocre films for mediocre people.Hollywood: Stop ruining iconic characters and franchises with political correctness. Political correctness is a really stupid concept where people gets something valuable, not because they have earned with talent or skills, but because they belong to a minority that must not be ignored.Enough said!!!"

When I heard that they were creating a new ghostbusters with a all female cast I was a bit sceptical if it would do justice. Such a waste of a film! The two main characters, fat lady (one that cannot act and always using same technics) and the old looking one as well as the annoying ""genius"" ruined the film. What has Hollywood come to?

",2018-09-19 00:00:00,3,"I believe Screen Junkies' Honest Trailers said it best: This movie proves that women are just as capable to star in bad remakes as their male equivalents.That being said, this is really an amazingly bad movie. All four man characters act as the funny sidekick, which means there's no character left to relate to. That, along with a plot so bad even the ghostbusters cartoon guys would have trashed it, makes for a horribly bad movie.Let's hope for another, better, remake in ~2030."

" Daft as the original without trying to be the original
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,8,"It's easy to hate any film that re-boots a classic, it can't ever be the same, or as good as you remember, especially with something as huge as the Ghostbusters. For that reason many people will hate it, some will hate it because they replaced the men with women, some will love it for that, I'd bet not as many people as should will rate this film for a reason other than those above, but as someone who loves the original movies and doesn't generally get on board with re-boots, I really enjoyed the film! I already love many of the actors in it, and they didn't disappoint, the actors I didn't already know we're also great, I loved the nods and cameos and I'm glad it wasn't just a re-make with women in the lead roles but its own take on a classic that I think worked and was fun to watch"
" Disgusting blasphemy that disgraces the original...
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,1,"Full disclosure, I hate the actresses in this movie in almost anything they do. Kristen Wigg is worthless in any role only topped by Melissa McCarthy's nausea-inducing ""humor"". Studios putting these women together over and over again in cookiecutter drivel that should have been stopped with the first ""send it around the room"" moment when someone should have put a stop to this before we were force to hear of its existence."
" Sooo many missed opportunities. But just a bad idea in general.
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,3,"This is a prime example of what could have worked. Not worked in the sense this movie would be considered a masterpiece like the original. But worked in the sense that this movie could have provided something decent for us. Without a well crafted script with carefully executed comedy, this movie relies heavily on improv comedy. This movie falls short not because of the cast, as it is usually never the casts fault for the downfall of a movie, it's the writers and director. I actually love Kristen Wig and occasionally Melissa McCarthy. They're quite funny actors. The problem is that Ghostbusters is supposed to be a movie that gives the punchline and let us take in the cleverly subtle jokes, it's like a good meal. The meal being the plot. The desert being the comedy. But the writers and director of this movie believe if they stuff our mouths with constant dialogue, improvised dialogue may I add, every second of the movie, we'll start enjoying it. There are moments in the movie that I almost laughed, before it was shut down by actors constant need to throw in more dialogue. Movies like this don't need improv. Movies like Bridesmaid are great for that, because with a casual setting and tone, improvised lines make the movie more impressive. However, a movie rebooting one of the funniest comedies ever made, that has to do with ghosts and science fiction. Is not a movie in need of improv."
" What went wrong?
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,4,"The first time I tried to watch this movie, I didn't make it past about the first half hour. Nothing hooked me in, and I got bored and frustrated.Giving it another chance with a second viewing, I found that it was entirely lacking at whatever level and genre you might think to approach it. I agree with what many have said -- I didn't laugh once. You have so many cast members, even beyond the four top stars, who have proven themselves to be good in other comedic roles. It makes me wonder why none of them could even manage to pull something out of a scene or situation to yank in a bit of an improvised gag that would at least make you chuckle. There's just nothing there. No physical comedy, no slapstick or even predictable jokes, and certainly nothing dry.So who was it that caused everything to fall flat? Was it the writing, the directing, the editing? Did the producers have an aversion to anything remotely interesting or funny? I understand that when you are in the moment performing it is tough to see the big picture. But these are four women who have done plenty of other movies, sketches, and been successful. Even giving them the benefit of the doubt leaves me wondering whether they could sense that nothing was landing right.I don't want to line up too many comparisons to the 1984 original, but that movie delivered some really dry comedy and provided more background to the characters, the build-up of the story, and that just seemed to be missing here (or at least what was here was an afterthought)."
" Ungodly horrible
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,1,"The only thing funny or scary about this movie is that is an absolute horrible remake of something far greater.Even the fan made films far exceed this disaster.As a franchise movie, this fails greatly - and as a standalone movie (f it were) this is equally as bad.To even think that this had merit on it's own is a mystery to me.Nothing to this movie was remotely interesting. During the entire time I saw this, was anything captivating.The effects were overdone and the story was underdone.How can the director, producers and main and supporting cast not see this as it is happening right infront of their eyes?Horrid story, atrocious casting and performances and an absolute mess of gigantic proportions.Why does something like this even exist?Creativity should be running wild, instead it is being held back with all this technology to compose something so awful as this.A big budget blown on bullshti - just because it has a female cast.The total cast was poorly chosen - maybe it would have been slightly better with a far better cast, but then - even the story would still suck.I saw this for free and I still overpaid."
" First and only time I've slept in the cinema!
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,1,"Absolutely awful!
I ignored all the bad reviews until I saw it for myself and unfortunately they were right.
The lead actresses are boring, don't carry the movie. Nothing happens, no cool scenes which you can reflect on. As the headline suggests it's the only time I've been so bored I slept through the movie... at the cinema!
This movie contains zero elements of why the first two movies were so successful. The dark creepy ghosts are now replaced with ultra bright neon coloured ghosts (obviously made that way to not scare the kiddies). The entire atmosphere and creepyness of the original is lost and instead is replaced with a cold, sterile atmosphere like going into a hospital. All the jokes are soooo in your face it's almost like ""isn't this funny?!? laugh dammit!!"". Lacks all the subtly of the original.
Overall I wish those MIB memory pens exist so I can forget about all of this."
" How did this film not win any Golden Raspberry?
",2018-09-06 00:00:00,1,"I still remember the hoo ha that this turkey of a film caused back in 2016, the discussion boards which used to exist on this site were aflame with the stupidity of the SJW's.The logic of course was that if you didn't like this terrible film you were obviously a woman hating heterosexual (white) man who struggled with the idea of strong women. I don't know where the strong women are in this film. Or the funny women. Or the talented women... Oddly enough the funniest element of this ""Girl Power"" film is Chris Hemsworth. Yes, a man. Anyway, the SJW's could not or would not admit that the best parts of a film are often shown in a trailer. Why would you show anything else? The trailer consisted of bad and unfunny jokes and unfunny boring women. How this film didn't win a Raspberry is beyond me but then again, it was all about PC agenda pushing wasn't it?

It's a little cheesy in places but sometimes a bit of cheese is good. Decent plot, good cast. Loved the nods to the older films, especially the cameos. I think it's worth the watch, we certainly didn't feel like we'd wasted 2 hours, we really enjoyed it."

" Lacks The Charm of the Original
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,4,"(Flash Review)This was a goofier and modern remake which follows the original storyline to a medium degree. It seemed to trade charm and character development for a bunch of stitched together slapsticky scenes. There were some OK jokes but zero charisma of the original guys four guys. The Chinese delivery guy was the actually funniest character. There was absolutely zero dramatic tension, which the original had that greatly accentuated the story. The story was more choppy and abrupt vs the original which had proper flow and pacing. The special effects were professional but oddly some the effects went over the letterbox boundaries; perhaps the 3-D experience was built in. I presume this was trying to draw in more females to view it as Chris Hemsworth is included for the goal of being a slab of meat as well as many stupid male jokes. Each original Ghostbusters member gets a cameo including Slimer and Stay Puff. If you are an original Ghostbusters fanatic, you probably will hate this."
" ghost BUST ers
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,1,The only time I laughed in the entire movie is when I laughed at how bad it was. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse it did. Hard to believe they got some of the biggest comedic actresses of the time to agree to this horrible script.

What a waste of time, money and talent. The horror, the horror."
" I actually enjoyed myself
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,9,"I'd like to make it clear, I love the originals, I wore out my VHS of the first film. Recently (last month) I showed the original to a group of 12yr olds, they found it cheesy, obvious and said it was chasing the jokes. They couldn't see why it was a cult classic. They didn't mind the poor effects (a large group of them like other 80's films). They also disliked the stereotypes in the film, the needy woman, the weak geek etc. They had a point, this new film is no worse, yes the jokes are obvious, yes it's on the nose, but I did laugh. 
I liked the takeaway issues, the comments on property prices, the linking of the ghosts to science rather than an ancient god. They had chase scenes, some good fights, and the cast gelled well. I also was happy with a new storyline, it worked in the genre, but didn't erase the old story."
" We love it!

" Entertaining movie but nothing like the first two
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,6,The movie was pretty good in the beginning but failed to keep you interested middle to the end. Think Hollywood so caught up in to making an all female cast work that they didn't give them a polished script. I don't blame the actors but the reason why the first two worked is because the cast improvised more. The story plot however I thought was good just wished they kept it more exciting to watch. Doubt there will be a second one made after these results.
" Don't answer the call

I have finally whatched Ghostbusters and it was a pleasant surprise! I enjoyed every moment. I'm sure my son would like this version over the original. There was still a lot of throw backs to keep me happy without recycling a play by play of the original. The special effects were better and not over used and the costumes looked more authentic. I really don't know why his has bad reviews other than a lot of people didn't give it a chance and had their opinion before watching it."
" Hmmm...
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,1,"Love the original two movies, but that's not what I should base this on. Geez I'm 80 minutes into this 2 hour film and I'm bored enough to turn it off, if it didn't have the ghostbusters name I would have probably have skipped past it, but I honestly haven't laughed, snickered or even grinned at any of the ""jokes"". Watch if you want to kill a couple of hours but don't expect much."
" Hilarious Movie - Ignore the Misogynist Trolls
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,9,"This movie is hysterical & only has a bad rep due to internet trolls. I can watch it again & again. And yes, I grew up on the original Ghostbusters movies & the tv show, & I still love this one. Please make a sequel to this reboot!"
" Doesn't deserve such negative reviews...
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,7,"When I heard they were making a female ghostbusters reboot, I had high expectations. This movie isn't anything amazing, but it's certainly progression.I feel like for it to have succeeded, it'd had to be perfect in every way. Whether this is because it's an all female cast or because of its predecessors I do not know, although I feel it may be both. Although not breathtaking, this movie did its job by providing the humour and good cast that I expected. The jokes are funny, albeit sometimes cheesy and the male receptionsit really delivers the best lines. I also love how self aware this movie is, the franchise itself is known for being over the top and they have really embraced it here.Plot wise, it's sweet and simple. A Physics professor named Erin attempts to remove her previous works on the supernatural from the public eye to avoid embarrassment. On the other hand, her old collegue Abby and her assistant Jillian are still using these works as the basis for their study at a seperate university.Erin attempts to persuade Abby to stop promoting their work, but instead gets roped back into the research project. They begin to investigate new areas and befriend their fourth member, Patty along the way. From here onwards, the plot revolves around two things... the capture and proof of the supernatural and attempting to discover whom is responsible for the sudden spike in paranormal activity, whilst the government attempt to cover up all evidence to prevent public outcry. Of course, the person responsible for the increase in ghosts is intent on using them for destruction and must be taken down, even if it means wiping out all the collected evidence of the ghosts existence. I highly reccomend a watch if your looking for a bit of fun that all ages can enjoy, just don't expect an Oscar worthy plot and you won't be disappointed."
" So much hate for such an adequate remake
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,8,"I just took it for what it was, a Ghostbuster movie. It was a fun throwback, with some interesting characters and electric visuals. It's a pity it was overshadowed by feminist and anti-feminist propaganda. I loved GB as a kid, and got the same feels this time around. I hope kids watching it today can do so without any influential bias. There's more to it than that. Get nerdy, bust the ghosts, have fun, be heroes!"
" Worth a look
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,5,"This movie started out with a big problem. It has to live up to being a follow-up to one of the great iconic movies of the 1980s. But that shouldn't have stopped it being a good film in its own right. It has a decent cast, nice-looking CGI effects and even cameos from several of the original's cast.
But then it ran into a problem so many re-boots and re-makes run into. It is being made by people who have no idea what made the original so great and who see it more as a quick buck rather than a chance to re-imagine an old franchise. Though it entertains, it's a lot better than most of the recent Hollywood re-boots and there's the odd moment of genuine humour, it's still just a typical cash-cow. Compared to the complex personalities of the original team, the four new Ghostbusters are all one-note characters (one of them seems to think ""eccentric"" means simply staring boggle-eyed through comedy-nerd glasses). Just about everyone else in the movie is there simply to be irritating. Most of the humour is just low-brow, and the horror is uninteresting. There are no images that come close to rivalling the memorable designs of the original two films, and you come away feeling nothing for the characters. Worth a look as a curio for fans of these kinds of movies, and the cast do the best with the spartan material they're given, but it's hardly the kind of thing for repeated viewings."
" Hot garbage
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,1,"I understand that filmmaking is a left leaning business, but to remake an iconic movie with female rather than male main characters is too far. Also the acting, humor, and CGI is bad to. Don't listen to critics, this is not a good movie."
" 2 things
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,1,"It comes down to 2 things.If you like syfy, action, and original ghostbusters this movie writing is horrible. Don't watch.If you never seen original or dislike it, and or don't watch action or syfy much then you'll probably love this movie. Be prepared to laugh and enough"
" I wanted to like it.
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,3,"I really did, but the story didn't flow logically. And the characters choice didn't match their intelligence. The best parts of the film were the cameos of the original stars."
" I liked it; not sure why others didn't.
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,10,"I'm not sure why so many people have it an awful rating, with many people declaring they wanted to ""claw their eyes out""! That seems a little cray cray but to each their own. First off the original GB's were okay but not like academy award winning movies that got pissed on. People who are acting like that are just being weird trolls and have nothing better to think about.This movie is funny and it makes fun of itself by taking elements of the original but putting their own spin. I'm pissed people took this movie which is a comedy and made it some weird political agenda. It's abour freaking ghosts and they cook people who believe in them and fight them for people who think them crazy; that's it. If you read more into it, than your looking for stuff to not-pick on.I'm also pissed there won't be a sequel because I think the second one would have really been awesome since they were going to bring in Zuel, but I guess now we'll never know. If you want a fun movie to watch with the family, then this movie is it."
" Don't mess with a classic
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,6,Obviously this is a remake of the original Ghostbusters. Ostensibly it is the same story as the original but with gender roles reversed. There is really nothing wrong with the acting but it lacks the originals sharp wit. It does benefit from modern CGI. It is more importantly another message to Hollywood that you don't touch or remake classics. An often repeated lesson from which Hollywood never seems to learn.
" God - the stereotyping
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,1,"The only funny thing I saw in the first half was the look on Jones's face when she first saw a ghost although i thought that type of racial stereotyping was deemed politically incorrect 50 years ago. I also thought showing women as completely incompetent of any scientific or logical thought was frowned upon now days, although I know showing all men as complete irrational, one dimensional idiots as they did in this movie is now considered not only OK but mandatory.
I couldn't believe they included a whole discussion of the movie ""Ghost"" which no one under 45 remembers. Half of the actresses can only know this film from their studies of ancient classics but had to pretend they have regular wet dreams about a geriatric actor. 
I think maybe they hope you will turn off the volume, play loud music, take acid and only watch the light show parts of this movie."
" Hollywood was too concerned with woman being just as funny as men...
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,1,That they forgot to actually make a ghostbusters film.
" Terrible
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,1,"Terrible Story.... Terrible plot ... Terribly acted
What was the point of this movie ..? Tried to copy parts of the original it but bring it up to date & totally failed.
No funny bits or any of the magic from the original"
" Nope not the original
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,5,"Ok, so it's not the original movie that won our hearts in 1984. However, it didn't ruin my childhood either. Kate McKinnon's pseudo Egon character is Ober the top strange and annoying, but watching her on SNL, makes me believe that she is naturally strange and unfocused. Leslie Jones, steals the movie! I really like her character and her persona in general. 
Ghostbusters: Answer The Call, is not for diehard fans, it's not a great reboot either. It's a movie that you need to watch with the idea that it's just a fun movie about a group of ladies who are trying to capture ghosts. Don't over expect! The end credit scene seems to set up for a sequel, but I think there is too much hate for this one."
" Who you Gonna Call? NOT THEM
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,5,"I'm putting all controversy aside for this film, because I'm one of the very few who was excited from the trailer. I mean the film has a great cast, a capable director, and it's the Ghostbusters what could be wrong? Well let's do this, first off the film is needlessly a reboot. With so many movie sequels coming out years and years after the original, Ghostbusters has an opportunity to do a continuation but instead decided to reboot a movie that didn't deserve a reboot, and nothing will ever be that first film from 1984, so the least you could do was give an entertaining follow up, but no remake it. I wouldn't mind that much if the plot and story left something to be desired but it's actually a very standard story which doesn't make for an interesting take, it basically Re-tells the original with a female cast and setting it in modern day. Speaking of which the cast, I actually love this cast Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth give great performances and are definitely the heart of the movie, they are the only two that feel like their own characters. While I love Mcarthy, Jones, and Wiig who are all hilarious women and great actresses, there characters are not memorable and they aren't really given anything funny to say. It feels like Feig and the cast were told to play it safe and that's evident from the writing, effects, and awkward cameos. Finally last but not least, I personally always saw Ghostbusters as an interchangeable team, one that could have many different people with different genders or race or whatever, and an all female cast is not bad, but that shouldn't be a The whole point of a film. (especially Ghostbusters) This is a film that feels like it could've been so much more, but instead is a forgettable yet innocent feature that just needs more creativity and comedy that made the franchise work in the first place."
" Don't Blame The Cast
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,3,"When I heard that this movie was coming out, I was confused. Why remake a movie that was so beloved by so many. The movie has a strike against it before it was was released.When I finally sat down to watch the movie, it met my low expectations. Kate McKinnon could read pages out of a phone book and be funny. Melissa McCarthy is at her best when she plays a character that isn't over the top, same with Kristen Wiig. Leslie Jones has to be over the top, that's her style.I can't complain at the performances, they did the best with what they had. I thought the story was lacking although there was some good laughs.I'm hoping that a sequel is not in the works. Women with this much talent can find something much more befitting to them. If it happens to be on a movie channel, go check it out, lots of cameos."
" A BRILLIANT FILM & A BRILLIANT REBOOT
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,9,"LOVED GHOSTBUSTERS & the new crew of hilarious characters, all EXCELLENT!!! With perfect chemistry & BRILLIANT FX & Amazing gadgets it's one hell of a fun Supernatural Comedy blockbuster!!!

So yeah i love the Ghostbusters franchise & i absolutely loved the New Movie IT'S fantastic fun. Great characters & a hilarious movie!!!Just enjoy this as a new vision of Ghostbusters it's a new era of Ghostbusters & IT'S great!!! The only reason i gave it a 9 outta 10 is it loses a point because i felt it should be connected to the other 2 movies that's my only nick pit. Apart from that IT'S fantastic & IT'S a new GHOSTBUSTERS for my kids to grow up with as their classic"
" Give it a Chance - Loved It :)
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,10,"I was prepared to turn this off after a few minutes, but actually really enjoyed it. Laughed all the way through. Give it a chance, see what you think for yourself."
" Remember being a kid?
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,6,"Remember why you loved the original ghostbusters, because it was part of your childhood. That's the point childhood, a movie aimed at young people. Anyone watching this moving as a fully fledged grown up and expecting to be wowed as they were at age 9 is misguided. How do I know this, my 6 year old absolutely loves this movie. Like always asks to watch it! He loves the song, knows all the words and can't wait to see the original. However I know he's not going to enjoy the original as much as they just don't have the cool effects like movies now. This folks is reality and that's the way it is. Granted I smirked about 3 times but my son giggled and generally thought the slime was super cool. For keeping my son happy for 2 hours it absolutely get a 6. I like the actors and for that it's totally bearable!"
" Everyone I know IRL loves this
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,8,"I own this movie, saw it in theater with friends, watch it at home with family, discuss it with colleagues-everyone I know loves it. The only place I seem to find criticism is online, mostly because men are whining about how ""the feminists are taking over!"" Which I am so very sorry to say, is not the case. What this movie does it simply: It preserves the comedy, action, intrigue, and joy of the original Ghost Busters, but without all the blatant sexism! It has incredible stars, hilarious dialogue, and a plot that is just as engaging as anyone can expect from a Ghost Busters movie. Aside from people complaining that there isn't enough misogyny for this to be considered a winner, the only other complaint I see is that it's predictable: you know who the villain is, you know who the good guys are, and you know that there will be a happy ending. But if you don't like that, your problem isn't with the 2016 reboot, it's with Ghost Busters in general. This isn't supposed to be a serious, gripping drama; it's a science fiction comedy with lovable characters and fun adventures. My only complaint is that there's too much throw back to the previous films. I understand some people wanted to see old characters and all, but they really weren't necessary, and just ended up muddling the plot. Overall, though, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who isn't a whiny piss baby who feels threatened anytime they see a woman in power."
" Abysmally unfunny
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,1,"I'm genuinely surprised by the number of positive professional reviews for this movie, I can only assume that the negative fan response to this movie leading up to the release made it too politically risky for pro critics to say anything negative about it. This movie is a cringefest, it tries so hard to be funny, and the saddest thing is, seems to believe it is. It is just squirmingly awkward to sit through. The original Ghostbusters relied on deadpan, understated and dry humor. There was amazing chemistry between the cast, who played off each other - Venkman as the skirt-chasing con-artist, Stantz as the anyman, and Spengler as the cold genius. This cast has nothing. Melissa McCarthy shouts a lot. Kristen Wiid is awkward. Kate McKinnon acts like she's high on cocaine. Leslie Jones is the token black stereotype. Of all of them, Jones is the only one who comes close to being likable.It's pretty obvious that this movie suffers from a severe lack of competent directing - Paul Feig was clearly in way over his head, and couldn't prevent this disaster from careening off a cliff.Terribly performances, unfunny writing, zero direction ... all in all an embarrassment of a movie."
" Thoroughly enjoyed!
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,10,I was expecting this to be below average going by previous reviews but it was really good. Hoping for a second one???
" Not Funny
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,2,"The movie started with a lot of promise but the characters are all just very stupid/illogical and annoying. I don't care if they're women or men, they just annoyed me and this movie was not very well written. The male characters also were terrible actually, it's the first time I found Bill Murray completely unfunny. What a pointless movie this was."
" Thought it was going to be bad but was hilarious
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,10,"I watched this thinking it was going to be bad and really overtly feminist. I was surprised to laugh almost the entire film as the cast was really sarcastic, silly and down right hilarious. It doesn't take itself seriously and I would highly recommend for anyone to watch who just wants a good laugh"
" Ehhh.
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,4,"Okay, I gotta admit I like the effects, and some of the jokes were able to make me guffaw a few times. 
Sure, the movie was bad, but if I remember The 1984 version stunk as well, before getting a cult following. There are worse films out there, it is not fair to blame the cast, they worked with poor writing and directing. Blame Feig, he had a formula and tried to make it fit in an already established franchise. Booo, blame him and Sony.
What I would of like to see if the girls were the original GB kids, following in one of their footsteps( or at least one of characters, there is the link to GBI&II, not making cameos in the way they were handled in Feig's work. 
Also if it was maybe a mixed cast, male and female. Not Bridemaids with proton packs. 
I do feel sorry for the people who paid full price for it, I now just wait for Netflix to pick it up."
" Easy entertainment
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,10,"Lighthearted entertainment, we loved it watched it 3 times"
" Come on y'all, it's not that bad.
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,6,"Yes, I wish Hollywood could come up with more original stuff instead of rebooting everything, but this wasn't terrible. The original movie was great but if you can put that aside, this was cute. One of these reviews said something about the stereotype of angry black woman and I disagree. Leslie Jones used to come across to me as just yelling all the time but I've come to love her and she can be dang funny! She was good in this and I hope she starts doing more than SNL. This film is a solid medium. Not great, not terrible. Great cast, but underutilized."
" Simply Awful
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,2,This movie is just horrendous. I never write reviews on movies but as a massive fan of the original Ghostbusters I feel I have to warn people to avoid this film at all costs. It's billed as a comedy but I didn't laugh once. The acting is terrible i genuinely didn't care about any of the characters. I thought having the best two actresses from Bridesmaids would at least make it watchable. But it really doesn't. What the hell Chris Hemsworth is doing in it I dont know. He must have been very embarrassed watching his shocking performance. Even the noise the car makes is irritating. Not even the cameo from the great Bill Murray can save it. Don't waste nearly 2 hours of your life watching this garbage. If your feeling in a ghostbusters mode just watch the original you can't beat it.
" 1 star voters are angry ""fans""
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,7,"This movie was pretty good. I liked the cast a lot. 1 star voters are either sexist or think that everything that's not the first Ghostbusters movie is garbage. Maybe both.Anyway, pretty good. 7/10"
" Not a remake but an homage
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,8,"Back up people! I never write a review but this movies is a tribute and not a remake. It's super funny, great chemistry between them all.... love the cameos from the original movie. Just enjoy the movie and don't compare anything. It was never a reboot."
" Unbearable
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,1,"First of all, I want to clear that I'm in favour of intelligent strong female lead characters, I love Alien and Aliens (Sigourney Weaver), the new Tomb Raider (Alicia Vikander), MCU and Lucy (Scarlett Johansson), Edge of Tomorrow (Emily Blunt), Thor: Ragnarok (Cate Blanchett), just to name the firsts movies that comes to my mind, but this stupid SJW's new trend of trying to remake old classics, cult movies or just old movies with an all-female cast is unbearable, but the main point is not even about the all-female cast, the point is that they're traying to do it making real awful stupid movies, It's just that simple, if they do it with excellent stories and performances I support it, but this it's not the case at all (The same as Ocean's 8 and the new Star Wars movies, except Rogue One which I loved and validates my point), please, enough is enough."
" Solid comedy
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,8,"This is a well written and well performed comedy. I doubt it will become a classic, but there is very little to dislike and it has many scenes that made me chuckle. The inclusion of many SNL alumni makes even the tertiary characters enjoyable. In conclusion well worth spending an hour fifty on."
" Ghostbusters revival opportunity....wasted
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,1,"I love Ghostbusters.
The real ones.
The worst part of this movie is that we've lost a chance to see a Ghostbusters movie comeback.
This is not.
Those really funny, scary and enjoyable old Ghostbusters movies .
Opportunity .... missed.
Sad thing."
" Great Fun
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,9,"I feel a lot of misogyny as been directed towards this movie and it's mainly female cast! It's outrageous in the Twenty First century anything is judge in such a way!
This film in my opinion is better than the original. The storyline is stronger,the structure is more solid,the acting better and most of the jokes land.
A big plus is the female cast,we don't have to deal with the flat Dan Ackroyd or the egocentric Bill Murray.
This is fun and deserves more credit."
" They called, no one picked up.
",2018-06-16 00:00:00,2,"One of the worst mainstream films I have ever seen. Such a biased film agenda used to promote a front. Paul Feig wrote some of my favourite shows until this flaming pile. You are better to Use it as firestarter on a camping trip, it will be more useful!"
" Better than expected
",2018-06-16 00:00:00,6,"Whoooole lotta butthurt cry-baby fan boys cluttering this review page. The main cast is charming and have nice chemistry together. A lot of throwbacks and references to the original, as to be expected, but it's not too forced. The story makes sense and is engaging...modernized but still maintains the tongue-in-cheek campiness of the franchise. I'm tired of reboots I'm general but I was surprised at how often I laughed and enjoyed this one."
" Disrespectful to the old ghostbusters
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,1,"This movie is toxic and terrible at every turn, I normally find Kristen Wigg hilarious but once again Hollywood pushing the 'strong female lead' roles too hard they have ruined another movie. The writing doesn't seem to even bother making this satire work in any way, instead it makes sure to make the girls seem smart, socially important and generally better than the men in the movie who have clearly been written in the seem dumb and objectified. The stereotypical abrasive black woman who 'don't need no man' and the other bland characters made this movie an insult to the 1984 movie we all love so much. Stop making these shitty remakes or if you do atleast put some decent writing in them without your 'agenda' getting in the way of our nostalgia and maybe your movies will make some money back and get decently reviewed."
" No Action - No Comedy
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,1,"The movie has been advertised as a comedy movie but it's not. In fact, it is so boring that one wishes that it gets over as-soon-as-possible. The punch lines fall flat as the actors are trying to hard especially Kate McKinnon & Melissa."
" What a load of rubbish
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,1,"So after avoiding this film when it was first released due to the trailers making it look rubbish, I decided to watch it on Netflix because I was that bored.Opening scene was good, the special effects are obviously a marked improvement from the Ghostbusters 30 years ago and that is about as good as the film gets.First scenes with the main cast were very painful to watch. Everyone got up in arms that all the negative reviews were because the cast is female. At the end of the day if the actors are good I don't care what sex, colour, sexual preference etc. they are. If they can act well that is all that matters. Unfortunately the casting for this film was entirely wrong. Story, or what is referred to as the story, is so disjointed and poorly written that you just wait for the scenes were the cast aren't in it and it is just the special effects. To distract you from the dancing, obvious jokes that you see coming a mile away, and poor quality acting, there is a host of big names in small parts and cameos from the Ghostbusters. This fails and, if I'm honest, made me view the actors as being sell outs.Was ready to turn this off after the first 10 mins but sadly sat through the full length of the film and really wished that I had stopped after 10 mins and watched the kettle boil for the time that I wasted. I can honestly say I didn't laugh once during this film.The Ghosbusters films had decent storylines and were well acted. The setup for the jokes were subtle and well timed. The 'science' used in the films played well into the kit used. This film has none of that.This film should have been advertised as a spoof and done by the SyFy channel.Had the movie execs and writers actually thought this through then they could have had a nice money making stream of films rather than killing it off.
They should have made this film a continuation and had the Ghosbusters reunite and hand the torch to a new cast."
" One of the worst films I've ever seen and I watched eragon
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,2,"Awful film, awful cast, bad bad remake. If you have some spare time use it to avoid this film!!!"
" This is terrible no one shuld pay to watch this
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,2,"I am a woman and even I felt that this is not worth paying money to watch. It reminds one of all those commercials on TV where the woman is smart and has zip and the man is stupid and helpless. I mean those commercials have been running for ten years now.
I am not sure why the producer thought anyone wants to watch this. As a woman I didn't find it funny and it was not a comedy"
" Really disappointing
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,3,"I got really excited about 2 minutes in when the Ghostbusters music played. Took me straight back to being 10 years old. After that, though, it was mostly awful. I like Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy is ok but the kooky, scientist one was just annoying. The effects were pretty poor and there was no tension at all. I think they tried to play the final ""fighting the ghosts"" scenes for laughs and it fell flat. Shame."
" 9/10 Don't believe the 1* reviews
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,9,"Why people hate this film so much is beyond me. 
It's genuinely funny, the 4 leads are all really charismatic and bring their own stamp to a 'reboot'. Chris Hemsworth is brilliantly cast and all of them seem to be having a great time. Is this not what we want from a film like this? 
Oh, no wait, it's because the leads are women and the movie industry had the audacity to remake a favourite 'boy' film. 
Get a life mysoginists! This movie is awesome!"
" Should never have been made
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,3,"I admit from the start that I'm a massive fan of the original GHOST BUSTERS, although the sequel isn't so hot. Both films look like absolute classics compared to this ill-advised reboot of the series, recasting with an all-female ghostbusting team. Although the film looks similar to the original movies, it feels absolutely NOTHING like them. Gone is the character interplay and genuinely funny and droll performances that could be enjoyed by kids and adults alike; it's replaced by the kind of modern-day sarcasm and idiocy that I always end up hating. The new cast members are all unlikeable, and the likes of Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy seem to be competing as to who can be the most irritating of the lot. Yes, the new-fangled CGI effects are very colourful and pretty, but they don't have any of the character and finesse of the old effects, which you knew were hard to do thus all the more impressive. The plot is as predictable as they come, and the only person who raised the occasional smile was Chris Hemsworth. I'm afraid the new GHOSTBUSTERS should never have been made."
" Terrible
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,1,"This is a disappointment, the originals were brilliant this feels like an attempt to make money off their success"
" Just no!
",2018-05-30 00:00:00,1,"The acting was so bad, I asked my bf to change the movie 30 min, this is just a plain insult of the originals and to Harold Ramis's memory"
" An okay reboot of sorts, but still has a lot to overcome
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,6,"When it comes to reboots, production companies tend to have a fifty fifty shot at winning over newcomers and old fans alike. If it's done correctly, things will be amazing for everyone. The audiences will be pleased and the studio will make a profit off of their release. If done incorrectly, then everyone will have a bad time. And seeing that another sequel to Ghost Busters II (1989) was taking an eon to be made, it was later decided to just reboot it entirely. So how did this reboot fair? Middling to say the least for most. There were groups of people who were accepting of the finished product, while others were not content at all with how things were handled. There are things that work here though, it's just that those parts are scattered throughout a pile of multiple other problems. Some of which are difficult to get over. One of the biggest gripes hardcore fans had on this film was the whole gender swap gimmick. Honestly, that's not really a big deal.The plot of this story is familiar to those who know the original. Erin Gilbert (Kristen Wiig) is a promising teacher who ends up being rejected by her employer after they discover she once had written a legitimate scientific book on paranormal beings with a classmate by the name of Abby Yates (Melissa McCarthy). But before getting Yates to remove the published book, Gilbert ends up discovering an actual ghost with Yates and another cohort by the name of Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon). They also attract the attention of Patty Tolan (Leslie Jones), a person who is quite knowledgeable of the city's geography. Together they seek to stop the release of the random ghosts they find. The villain behind these random releases belong to Rowan North (Neil Casey), an individual looking to get back at society for his poor treatment of life in general. For the overall play out, its alright. But with director Paul Feig at the helm things should have been better. He did after all director Bridesmaids (2011) and The Heat (2013).Feig also helped co-write the script with another person by the name of Katie Dippold. Dippold was also the sole writer to The Heat (2013) and Snatched (2017). She has also written for the Parks and Recreation show. Even so, writers can have hit and miss projects. For one, the cast to this feature is exactly that. Only half of the actors who take center stage are actually likable to some degree. The two who make the viewing experience fun and fresh was McKinnon and Jones. Both had comical delivery and their mannerisms were unique. As for McCarthy and Wiig, both are not the greatest leads. McCarthy is winey and gabs too much. While Wiig is even worse with constant awkward dialog and unfunny lines. The same could be said for Kevin (Chris Hemsworth) who becomes the their secretary. Here, Hemsworth plays Kevin as a hunky dork and it's not really cumbersome to watch him act like a big goof. As for Neil Casey as the main villain, he's not bad but he receives almost no back story. His enthusiasm for the paranormal is only lightly scratched.Admittadly, Casey does resemble a distant relative to that of Peter Lorre. Either way, looks will not make a villain. The same could be said for the cameos of original stars Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson and Dan Aykroyd. Are they in the movie? Yes. Do they have memorable cameos? Only one of them really does. The rest are mostly throwaway roles and it's unfortunate. It just doesn't add much to the experience, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the initial franchise. However the special effects to the feature are well put together. Not only do the old gadgets make their way back to the big screen, but new ones come into play as well. McKinnon who plays Holtzmann is the tech wiz of the group and manages to create different kinds of paranormal weapons that help the ghost busters battle their demonic enemies. Some of which are ingenious by design. As to how on earth they were able to manufacture such a device and have it work properly all the time is still a miracle in itself.As for background visuals, the camerawork was adequate for this summer blockbuster. Robert D. Yeoman was the cinematographer for this production and a lot of it is well shot. There's no weird angles or shaky cam like sequences that will annoy the viewer. Yeoman has also worked on other projects like Dead Heat (1988), Yes Man (2008), The Heat (2013) and The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). Lastly when it came to music, the film score and soundtrack were decent too. The soundtrack is mainly made up of the Ghost Busters theme (originally sung by Ray Parker Jr.) being performed by other artists. In the end though, the film score is what real driving force throughout the running time and much of it helps. However unlike Elmer Bernstein's or Randy Edelman's score, this one remains to have its own unique theme. Composing the score was Theodore Shapiro. He does take Parker Jr.'s song and make an instrumental out of it but that's it. Shapiro also scored Wet Hot American Summer (2001), Tropic Thunder (2008) and Central Intelligence (2016).While it may have a good cast of actors and decent looking special effects, there are a lot of obstacles for viewers to overcome if they really want to enjoy this soft reboot. Only some of the main characters are likable and the villain isn't developed well enough. Camerawork and music is okay but it only helps a little."
" Netflix would, and did, buy this to fill a portfolio
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,1,"I have seen some Terrible movies on netflix, some which they bought and the original studio didn't want to sell it, some which they funded and released, for what I can imagine, for the lulz.This movie belongs and solely exists in that basket.Watch it over the counter and talking with friends. It's a but white noise."
" I don't get all the bad reviews,
",2018-05-29 00:00:00,10,"I thought it was terrific. Lots of laughs. Fantastic special effects and the acting was superb. Yeah, it's goofy, but it's supposed to be. I loved it and laughed all the way through!"
" Trash
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,1,"This was one of the worst movies ever, and i mean really, the human centipide is a marvelous piece of work compared to this, stop making reboots of classic movies and trashing them"
" An absolutely atrocious insult to a beloved franchise.
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,1,"This new Ghostbusters movie may have worked if they had done one simple thing. Made it a ""passing of the torch"" continuation of the previous films with the surviving members of the old team training a new younger team to take over the business. But instead Paul Feig decided to sweep the originals under the rug in favor of his own retelling. The result was ""Bridesmaids with Proton Packs"", and that is most certainly not a compliment. In order to understand why this movie fails, it's best to look at each individual element. Starting with:The CastThe cast is unimpressive, to say the least. The breakout star is Kate McKinnon, who's character, a wacky engineer named Holtzmann, has gained somewhat of a cult following. While I did get a few chuckles out of the character here and there, her schtick did get old after awhile. Kristen Wiig can be funny in the right roles, but sadly this was not one of those roles. She often seemed uninterested like she did not want to be there, and honestly I wouldn't blame her. Melissa McCarthy was the same character she usually plays, and I personally have never found her funny. This was no exception. Leslie Jones, much like McKinnon, did get some chuckles from me at times, but as most could already tell from the trailers, she was basically just the ""loud black woman"" stereotype. The worst performance without a doubt was (unfortunately) provided by Chris Hemsworth as the brain dead receptionist, Kevin. I was really hoping, based on the trailers, that he might possibly be the best thing in the movie, but he was quite honestly the worst, not that I particularly hold Hemsworth accountable. His character was written poorly, and many of the things he did made me cringe more than laugh.The VillainThe villain of this movie is a hotel handyman named Rowan, who his seeking revenge on humanity for having been bullied his whole life. He builds a device which brings spirits into our world, and he intends to wreak havoc with those spirits. Needless to say, Rowan is an extremely weak villain, especially when compared to the villains of the previous Ghostbusters films. The original film had Gozer, a powerful Sumerian god whose ultimate goal was the destruction of humanity. The second film had Vigo, a Carpathian warlock who intended to be reborn in order to seek world domination. These were both strong, developed villains, whereas Rowan just comes off as laughable, especially toward the climax, but more on that later. The Visual Effects The effects were cheesy and cartoonish. Words cannot be minced here. The various ghosts we see are unimpressive, and they all contain a strange hue of neon blue or green. Many have compared the effects to the ghosts in the live action Scooby Doo movies, but even that is giving it too much credit. In the original movies, the effects were done with puppets and the ghosts were made to look spectral as if they were really there on the set. Most of the original's effects still look great today, whereas in the reboot they already looked dated from day 1.The Plot*There will be spoilers in this section, but since I do not recommend this movie to my worst enemy, feel free to read ahead. Otherwise, stop right here. You have been warned.*The movie follows the same basic plot outline of the original, but not done nearly as well. Three of the characters start off as normal paranormal scientist who are called upon to investigate the hauntings of an old mansion where a tour guide was recently spooked. Before that, we get some unfunny jokes about wonton soup and queefing. Eventually we get to the mansion, where they look at the ghost in a scene very reminiscent of the library scene, only instead of getting scared off by a sudden transformation, one of them gets barfed on with slime. They end up losing there jobs at the university to go into business for themselves. They take up headquarters in an apartment above a Chinese restaurant, where Holtzmann works on some new equipment. They try testing out their new equipment at a subway station where they try to catch a convict ghost, but the equipment doesn't work and the ghost gets away. The MTA worker who called them, played by Leslie Jones, joins the team as a fourth member due to her knowledge of the city's history. She also gets them a car, which is a hearse from her uncle's funeral home. They also hire an idiotic receptionist named Kevin. They get their first real call from a concert hall where they end up battling a dragon ghost (yeah, it's THAT ridiculous) during a metal concert. They capture the ghost, and we get a random Ozzy Osbourne cameo. This was around the point in the original where they had captured Slimer and become heroes overnight, followed by a montage of them catching ghosts all over the city. Here we get know such cameo as they only intend to study the ghost. Eventually they find out about Rowan and that he is the one responsible for bringing the ghosts into our world. Before he can be taken by the police, he electrocutes himself on his machine, killing himself. He becomes a ghost which eventually possesses Kevin, who then goes to reactivate the machine. Eventually, the city is being overrun by ghosts, and the Ghostbusters must get to work. What follows is a sequence of some rather dull action, and a display of all sorts of different weaponry that Holtzmann was somehow able to afford to develop. These include sidearm guns, ghost grenades, a ghost gauntlet, and (I kid you not) a ghost CHIPPER. Eventually they confront Rowan, who gives up possessing Kevin, and then turns into (get ready, because this is really gonna hurt) a giant version of the ghost from the Ghostbusters logo. I won't go into any further detail, but it gets really ridiculous, especially the way they defeat him.The Bottom LineGhostbusters 2016 is a mess from start to finish. It should be worth noting that I have seen both the theatrical cut and the extended cut, and they are both terrible. The extended cut just has some altered dialogue and a ridiculous dance sequence involving the army. It does nothing to improve on the film, what little there was to improve anyway. Paul Feig clearly made this film with the intent to cater to people who like HIS films, and honestly I have not been a fan of his works. He clearly gave no consideration to fans of the franchise, and he and McCarthy even went so far as to insult the fans. That is not how you win an audience. This movie lacks everything that made the original a classic. Witty humor? Gone. Lovable characters? Gone. Believable chemistry among the actors? Gone. On top of that, it is played out as a straight up comedy. There are no attempts to be scary or taken seriously when necessary, unlike the original which had moments that can actually be terrifying to first time viewers. I didn't even mention the cameos, which honestly there isn't much to say about. The surviving cast members from the original make cameos as different characters than we are used to seeing them as, and they all seem forced and don't do much other than attempt to provide fan service (and fail miserably). There is even a bust of Harold Ramis at one point, and a tribute to him in the credits. But honestly, I think he was just rolling in his grave. This movie killed any chance the Ghostbusters franchise had of making a comeback, but we still have the originals to go back to at any time. Just cross the streams on this awful reboot. I give it one star, but that's just being generous. But hey, it is one more star than I gave ""Jack & Jill"", so it has that going for it."
" This is my opinion
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,1,"I just saw it and it was worse than expected. They try hard, but somehow just never hit the right tone. instead of using what works, from the brilliant 2 movies and the wonderful tv series, they tried something different and failed horribly. There is nothing worth watching if you love the old movies, it's all like a dumbed down, childrens version of the great horror-comedy originals. I wold pay money to undo this stain on the originals and iam mad at everyone involved, in making this movie one of the worst trainwrecks, i have seen in a while. What a bummer."
" Disappointing
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,2,"This movie makes no sense since the beginning. Some connections in the plot are missing. Characters are purposely the negative of the 80s movie, 4 women and a boy playing the receptionist. I don't remember a receptionist that was ridiculous as this guy in the first movie. I believe this movie wants to take advantage of the feminist fashion of these years: every time male are majority this is seen as sexist, so must be fight back with the same coin. Total dumbness."
" The worst
",2018-05-10 00:00:00,1,By far one of the worst movies Ive ever seen and Ive watched two girls one cup
" Possibly the worst remake of all-time....
",2018-05-04 00:00:00,1,"This movie, if one can call it that, should never have been made. Who read the script and said to themselves, ""this will be a good movie and will do well at the box office?"" Terrible writing, mediocre acting with poor CGI = a trainwreck. No originality. Hollywood is a mess and garbage movies like this will only make it sink faster."
" Good movie except Kristen wiig who ruins the whole movie !
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,7,Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon are a delight ! They are very funny ! but they should have had someone else other than that Kristen Wiig woman. She is really drawing the mood down and the aesthetics (and I'm a woman saying this !!) Wasn't there someone else who was funnier? Or looked more beautiful or more charming or cuter or whatever? !! She is cold and no talent of acting.
" Okay Ghostbusters reboot is good, but not as great as the original
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,6,"Reboots and remakes are tricky. Do you remain faithful to the source material, which then begs the question, why remake/reboot the film if it's already been done? Gus Van Sant's shot-by-shot remake of ""Psycho"" took this notion to the extreme, which I believe that was the point of Van Sant's remake. Filmmakers rebooting/remaking classics are left in unenviable either changing beloved iconic films, which often offends fan sensibilities, or remain slavishly loyal to the original source material, leaving little reason for the remake/reboot's very existence. The Ghostbusters reboot tried to do something new and found the ire of many fans. Sadly, a lot of those online fans turned out to be misogynistic trolls who hated this film simply because of it's all female Ghostbuster cast, but that's a pretty ridiculous reason to hate on this film. Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones are incredibly talented comedians and deserve enormous respect for carrying this film. What I disappointed me about the the Ghostbusters reboot was that the script was not all that funny and it also lacked the funhouse scares of the original (you know, where it's actually scary in parts, even though it's a comedy). I think this film also suffered because the audience already knew the origin story, so watching the team figuring out how to use their proton packs and traps really didn't have the gee whiz fun of the original. Another element that made the original so fun was the great use of location shooting around New York City. This reboot is also set in the Big Apple, but doesn't make use of NYC nearly as well until the film's climax in Times Square. Generally speaking, this felt like a watered down version of the original, not unlike an inferior TV series pilot for a TV show version of a popular movie. But the film does have it's pluses, which primarily are the four leads, solid special effects, and fun cameos by the three of the original Ghostbuster team, Murray, Akroyd, and Hudson (Harold Ramos has sadly since passed away). Overall, the likability of the cast and the strong production values make this worth watching, even if the material if vastly inferior to the original."
" Wow... just bad
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,1,How could you make a remake of Ghostbusters and it not be even a little bit funny?
" There's Something Strange in the Neighborhood - makes Ghostbusters II look like Godfather II
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,5,"I love this Ghostbusters. Why are the jokes and the writing so bad? Why are all the ghosts green? Why are there so many soup jokes? Why did all the actors agree to do this? Why is this even called a Ghostbusters? It should just be a chick comedy about 4 friends starring Wiig, McCarthy, and McKinnon and Jones. The 4 girl Ghostbusters hanging and cracking jokes with each other are all the only really good parts. Unlike the original, the ghostbusting aspect of this Ghostbusters is not very good, at all, at, all. Everything the original Ghostbusters achieved, this version fails miserably. It's not very fun for the audience. The ghost scenes are terrible. The comedy is unsophisticated. It's not even close to scary. The sets are so unauthentic looking. All the nerdy scientific jargon is just dumb. All the ghosts are green! Except for the blue ones. Ooooo those blue ghosts are aweeeesoooomee. NOOOOOTTT! Slimer is the only creative commendable appearing phantom and he's straight out of the original! Where'd all that money go? Straight down the New York City sewer if you ask me. There's too much to go on but c'mon Hollywood write a good script, you have great stars to work with, namely, K Wiig in this movie.(The original Ghostbusters had a classic opening scene, you know; this version has the worst opening scene ever lol)"
" Terrible. Awful. An insult to the original.
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,1,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. For a remake movie, it is definitely one of the worst I have ever had the displeasure of watching & it is an insult to the many times better original. I did not laugh once, & I like to laugh. I enjoy comedies. This is not a comedy. It is a cinema tragedy. It is aggressively feminist & for example, the part of the secretary played by Hemsworth shows the supporting male lead as a painfully thick & moronic dumb-wit with no charm or intelligence. This is compared to the 1984 original where the secretary part is played as a female by Annie Potts. Her portrayal was smart & sharp, feisty & assertive compared to the remakes male thicko. This should never have been remade. This is purely an attempt for the studio to reassign lovable & original characters to a female & modern audience instead of using the same energy to develop fresh strong characters within a newly written role."
" Not Ok
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,1,This destroyed my memory of Ghostbusters as a kid. I wish upon no one this torture of a film. If I could rate lower i definitely would. I pledge this is the worst movie I've ever watched.
" Not a 1 or 10 star. It's just ok
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,4,"Just finished watching this and it wasn't as bad as I had feared. It's actually fairly entertaining at times but it suffers from overall poor writing. Before all of you 10/10 star people accuse me of of not liking the movie just because of all the main characters are female, I would like to point out that I find Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Kristen Wiig all very funny (I'm not that familiar with Leslie Jones), but they can't just magically make medicore writing great.
There is some funny banter between the four ghostbusters and Chris Hemsworth, (who plays the dumb, good looking receptionist) every now and then, but most of the time the parts that are clearly meant to be funny instead end up being a light chuckle or nothing at all. Especially some of the one-liners just made me cringe and it feels like whoever wrote them just though that as long as the line is delivered by someone who is normally funny it's going to work.While I think that some of the 1 star reviews comes from people who are just upset about the all-female cast, the overall mediocre score is pretty much in line with my own impression of the movie. It's neither a 1 or 10 star in my opinion. It could easily have been maybe a 6 or 7 but the poorly written jokes puts too much of a burden on the cast to carry."
" Entertaining
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,5,"I saw this movie in theaters. Though it is not a good movie, I was entertained.Plot/Script - This movie doesn't really have a script. Most of this movie is improv. This results in a lot of padding, riffing, and awkward pauses. The story isn't very good, and there are a lot of plot holes. Some of the jokes are funny, but most of this movie is extremely dumbed down. Characters - All of the actors in this movie aren't given very good direction. They all try to be the comic relief (which is partially due to the lack of a script) and it doesn't work very well. Most of the characters are pretty inconstant and idiotic.Sights and Sounds - The cinematography and sound design isn't that great in this movie. This movie doesn't do anything creative or original. There aren't many things in this movie that are done well, but it is a bit entertaining."
" An okay comedy with a good cast
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,6,"I really don't get the 5.3 rating on here. Ghostbusters was pretty funny, even if the second half of the film wasn't as good as the first. Kristen Wiig was easily the best cast member, and she's really funny. Melissa McCarthy is also a very funny actress but I don't think she was given much to work with. Leslie Jones was also likable and genuine, while Kate McKinnon (who is early the best actor on SNL) was a bit too quirky for my liking. Chris Hemsworth was also pretty funny.I don't understand people who complain about a ""feminist agenda"" (as if that's a bad thing) or say that the film is sexist because the male characters were written as idiots. Did you miss the whole movie? Almost every character, male or female, is written as mindless and silly. That's the whole point of the film!Overall, Ghostbusters is a pretty good movie. The first half is laugh out loud funny, but the second half is disappointing with very little humor and overwhelming special effects. 6.5 out of 10."
" Easy to watch fun reboot
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,8,It's never going to be as good as the originals but it's a great reboot of its own. Don't understand how others can say this is sexist as it's just some amazingly funny women.
" I Nice and cute movie.
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,10,"A really nice movie you'd love to watch with family on weekends. Its a warm comedy for all ages, and I thoroughly enjoyed it ! Its not blockbuster category, but excels in what it intends to do."
" not nearly as good as the original
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,4,No spoilers just my thought on the movie. The jokes aren't funny the effects aren't good and shocker feminists im not doing this because of sexism! it was bad but not nearly as bad as people say it is so my final score is 4 out of 10
" Not Real Women - Just Bad Characters
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,1,"The movie is shot beautifully and is wellmade in terms of effects, however, the storyline, characters, and acting is terrible. Overall, it seems like the writers tried to pay tribute to the original Ghostbusters and at the same time outdo them. Every single character delivers punchline after punchline and I rarely found myself laughing. The characters do not seem complete or like they could have been real people, instead they are cartoony and just strange.My biggest complaint about the movie, however, is the fact that the leading characters, the women, have been degraded to just that - the fact that they are female. They do not have any distinct personality, goals, or anything that make them stand out. Still, the emphasis on them being ""girls"" is constantly being thrown in your face along with everything being different shades of pink and jokes about how ""stupid"" men are. The roles have been switched and we see a lot of ""stupid"" men, while the women throw around ""big words"" (because they need to seem smart) while trying to save the world. Personally, I think it is great to see women in the leading roles - but I do not like how they are being portrayed. They are so far from being real people and I wanted them to be that; be real people. Not women who are supposed to be ""better than men just because they are"". I do not mind them being a little cartoony at times but there does not seem to be a reason for them being so in the movie. I do not think this movie is empowering women, instead I think it does the opposite, and overall, I think it is a terrible movie that I will not be watching again."
" see it more than 1 time and it is better than the oldies from the 80'ties
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,10,Wow it is getting better for every time I see it and I just keep on get new bits every time... not many film does that for me it is for me like The Shawshank Redemption but just in the Comics way. Looking forwards for number 2
" A high budget SNL skit.
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,3,"There's some movies that you just don't re-boot and this classic was one of them. The special effects team did a great job, but it truly was an SNL skit on steroids. Everything from the cast to the exaggerated humor and delivery. It felt like a Feminist SNL circle jerk. AVOID."
" Delightful, funny, fun film
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,8,"This is good in all the ways the original way: It's a kid-friendly, well-crafted, silly Hollywood comedy. It has great acting (great ad libs, too!), great writing, a solid plot, a nice mix of tributes to the original (including some very nice cameos!) and references to contemporary culture that people too young for the original will also get on with.The only difference between this film and the original - and it's a big one - is that this film does not engage in any cringe-worthy sexism. The point here is not feminist - although that's a point, too - the point is that the sexism of the original was bad, lazy film-making, that ruined my enjoyment of it - and would ruin how many young girls' enjoyment of it how much more? Of course, at the end of the day, it's just a Hollywood film. Don't expect anything profound or game-changing in it. But for what it is, it's great."
" Boring
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,4,"I should also say that i do not really like the old Ghostbuster movies. They are ""ok"" .. but also kind of boring to me... and have not aged well. (they were not part of my childhood .. and i only watched the original first one after i watched the remake)What i did not like at all about this movie was the chemistry (or lack thereof) of the main characters. All four Ghostbusters seemed like they did not even like each other at all, nor did the story seem like they were forced together against their will. 
The whole ghoststory made no sense anyway and felt rather cheap. I mean, not even a saturdays scoobydoo episode would present such a weak story. Then as often said .. a team of heroes rises and falls with their villain(s) .. only there is no villain in the movie, none to speak of anyway. The villain, too has no character and is one dimensional.It may have been a cheesey comedy action flick .. but failed at that, too. It was not cheesy or funny enough for that. Most jokes did not land or were cringy .. and more on the level of ""fart jokes"" which are not funny either .. but rather cringy.Now i dont know why one would think a ghost story would make a very good comedy anyway .. as i found the old Ghostbusters to be rather boring, too. But the chemistry between the characters is much better in the old ones with the characters being a lot more complex .. and also not really heroes but at least partly .. quite some scammers and d***s. They were both rather unfunny though.It is not smart, not funny and speaks to the mind of a 6 years old at best."
" A year and a half ahead of it's time.
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,8,"If the 2016 ""Ghostbusters"" reboot came out in March '18 it would have been hailed as a great ""feminist"" moment the same as '17s ""Wonder Woman"". It would have been a hit and not a disappointment. That's a shame because the new ""Ghostbusters"" movie is a funny movie and should have been a hit. I was in my early 20s when the original ""Ghostbusters"" came out. I liked the movie then and I like it now. I believe that people that were 10 years younger when it came out really, really like it. That's cool. But why the over-the-top mean ""outrage"" at the all-gal reboot. Like most people, I see funny as funny. I don't care if it's male or female. This movie funny/very funny. I'll be watching it again pretty soon."

" What a terrible move
",2018-02-15 00:00:00,1,This has to be one of the worst and most embarrassing movie to come out in a long time. It was absolutely pathetic.
" Not funny or original
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,5,"The problem with this film is that it is not funny or original, where as the film which this is based on is both these things.The best things about the film are it's design, action and special effects and the diligent performances of the cast, it's unfortunate that they have such a poor story and dialogue to contend with.It's obvious to see that there was plenty of improvisation going on here, especially after watching the out-takes, it's just a shame that the jokes are so poor. Not everyone can improvise as well as Bill Murray. This film was really starting off on the wrong foot by attempting to compete with the original.My mum and dad watched this with me, my mum's comments were that it should have been a 'new' take on Ghostbusters, there were too many throwbacks to the original story and situations. And simply, some parts just weren't very good.My dad's thoughts were, 'is this supposed to be funny?'Strangely though, there's one moment in this film that is undeniably cool and that's when Holtzmann unleashes those proton whips and the old theme tune plays.Otherwise this is very light on entertainment, save for the pretty colours and executions of the scenes that actually have ghosts in them."
" #TERRIBLE
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,2,"This movie had the initial hurdle of attempting to remake a classic film in Ghostbusters (1984). I generally like all four female cast members and find them funny (SNL, etc); however, the script and directing for this movie were TERRIBLE and didn't allow them to shine. There were a couple of times I laughed a little but it fell short in terms of a ""comedy"" with this cast. On a side note, I did find Chris Hemsworth's performance rather entertaining and funny; it was nice to see his comedic side opposite of the Thor movies. Overall, I do not blame the female cast, the script and directing are to blame; ultimately, I would skip this movie and save two hours of your life."
" The ratings are haunted: It is not so bad as it was rated
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,6,"Well, actually the movie is entertaining. Though it is not masterpiece as original films, but it's watchable. It gives you a pleasant aftertaste (a day or two after you've watched it).I'm far from the American political hate culture and the permanent war of all against all, and may be I've probably just missed the point of the hate battle about some «evident» social engineering messages of the movie (too subtle for me). But I can see that the movie ratings have been downgraded technically by flooding the ratings with negative reviews written by single person or narrow group of such persons. There is a distinctive pattern in all the «1 of 10» ratings. Even if you post from different accounts (nicknames) it is hard to hide completely your personal features like vocabulary (or preferable choice of words). In the «1 of 10» reviews there are peculiar repetitions (see the phrase «dead on arrival», for example; the author (collective of authors) is nursing the happily found metaphor like a gem).As to political accusations like feminist mainstream politcorrect agenda verging on the brim of intolerance, I think it is an exaggeration. Yes there is a strong influence of the time. But I see nothing insulting in turning main characters in women. The pretty girl with professional makeup isn't less believable as a nerdy scientist 24×7 playing in their basements with their equipment and eating fast-food crap for years. But it is not much less realistic than man with face of Dan Aykroyd in the role. After all, it's fantasy about funny ghosts, phony technical stuff and physics. Why so serious?Actors are fine. Characters are fine (especially fine the Jillian Holtzmann (Kate McKinnon) clown scientist type. Fudge, where to find such girlfriend, huh?). I think it was not necessary to depict Kevin's (Chris Hemsworth) character so dumb. It deprives the movie proper tension and conflict(s) on the probable multi love lines. There could be many plausible causes why handsome guy should seek such low paid job (from civil status or background to personal features like incompatibility with corporative culture of big corporations, which is actually hostile to natural man traits). Just a touch of playful stupidity (like with Holtzmann) would be OK. It seems that authors of the script doesn't know what to do with fully functional man in the team and how to keep him from seizing the leadership and stealing the show. The authors just do not believe in their own women's characters at all (and in woman's leadership in the whole), so them try to protect their story by downgrading all men's characters. Though the story with leading women's roles can be sound and plausible (the main characters are depicted as scientists with the skills above the average, after all, and that's the core competence on which their business has based). You just need to quit a lazy stance and to do a proper work on your script and everything will add up without unnecessary constraints and overprotection.Jokes are decently dumb (the mini-performance with middle finger - yeah, that's how its usually is going on in top institutions and scientific departments, gimme you resume, please). Script is flat, hardly original (but what you want from a remake).I think the movie could be much better with just a little bit efforts on the part of story development. But it is a common problem of all Hollywood movies nowadays."
" This movie accomplished something impossible
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,1,"For decades thousands of fans around the world have been wishing for third Ghostbusters movie. For one reason or another, it just never happened. We were mildly satisfied with a video game a few years back, but still wanted another live action. This movie silenced that cry. In fact, I think a lot of the silence were the viewers wondering what they just sat through. The rest of that silence was a feeling of remorse for wishing for another Ghostbuster movie. I'm not sure anyone wants another live action Ghostbuster film after this tragedy of a film. You can't unwatch a film.So Hollywood, on behalf of the thousands of 1 star votes, I'm sorry for wanting another Ghostbusters movie. Please don't do that to any other of our favorite film franchises. We've learned out lesson.To those of you out there that haven't seen this film but loved the original, just walk away. Turn off the dvd/bluray player or digital download. This is a kindness that I'm giving to you. Trust the thousands of 1 star votes over the handful of higher ratings.It did have a redeeming quality, the cameos from the original film. Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts all had small parts. Even the Hook & Ladder Company 8 Firestation as well as a bust of Harold Ramis (RIP) made it into the film."
" They crossed the streams.........
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,1,"Try and try as I may I finally succumbed to watch this....'deep breath' ...movie. I have nothing good to say about it whatsoever. My judgement isn't clouded by romantic ideations of the original and the fact that when I was a kid I wanted my own unlicensed accelerator. I just did't connect with any character and I certainly didn't even like them. The comedy was not funny but if I was a child I may have laughed. The visual effects were (as one review stated) like haunted honeymoon. Absolute rubbish from beginning to end. My poor wife had to listen to me rant about it for a good time after watching it and eventually made me a cup of tea to shut me up.
I have a little boy and when he is old enough you can guarantee that I will be showing him the original. Awful...just awful....AVOID."
" unnecessary really...
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,4,"The problem with remakes, is that they are always compared to the original movies, unless they are so old, that two generations have passed... It's not the case with this version of Ghostbusters, as I can still remember very well the original movie. And this version is indeed very poor. 
I understand the need and interest in the all female cast for a remake and I support it! We need such role models, and it's an acceptable situation to remake and recast.
However, I was expecting the movie to be at least as bit funny as the original (see above) and it was not. Simply the script was not good enough for this cast. by far the best character was Jillian Holtzmann performed by Kate McKinnon. With little speech time, she rocked her character, and I dare to say better than Egon Sprengler originally.. but the other characters we so.... uninteresting and really not that funny... Could have been much better.
The movie gets one star more from me for the multiple cameos of the original cast. 
In short, an unnecessary movie, the resources could have been used better. I don't think my daughter will grow up to admire the female ghostbusters as I did with the original cast. So they failed on both accounts: on the entertainment and on the social aspect."
" A silly, but ultimately harmless movie.
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,6,"I watched this movie one year after the huge controversy it caused by the mere reason of existing, and I was afraid to watch it, expecting something terrible. And in the end, it's just a silly comedy, completely forgettable. This is not a very funny movie, in fact, most of the jokes fell flat (with some remarkable exceptions), but, all in all it's a ""nice"" movie. The characters felt nice, funny and sympathetic, and it felt like a genuine (but forced) attempt to produce something funny. But, the improvisational style of humor of Paul Feig wasn't good for the whole ""Ghostbusters"" concept. The original movie was snarky and the premise is absurd, but the characters felt real, with real motivations. In this one, the characters (although nice) felt like cartoon characters improvising lame puns and references to other movies. So, the movie is filled with long and overbearing jokes which may turn it in a bore for many people. For me, it wasn't such a terrible experience, and I was surprised to enjoy it at many moments. But in the end, is completely underwhelming as a movie, and the most memorable thing about it will probably be the huge and absurd controversy created around it.6/10"
" Huge Fan of the Franchise, Thoroughly Enjoyed Watching It
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,10,"I grew up on the Ghostbusters, and I am a huge fan, collected all the toys and movies, watched all the animated series. I was always disappointed that there were only two women in the original movies, one was the secretary and the other was the victim of the villain. I have always wanted to have more female characters in the lead.I don't know why this got such a bad review. I enjoyed watching it immensely. I thought that it was smart and quirky to have all the main characters played by women. (Yey, girls!) The cast were delightful, and, as expected, their comedic timing was always on point. Their performance was perfect.The plot held up well to all the other previous ghostbusters storylines. It was funny, highly entertaining and witty, and it was something that I'm sure my eight year old self would have loved back in the 80s."
" Not As Bad As I Thought!
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,5,"Kristin Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Chris Hemsworth star in this 2016 comedy reboot/remake of Ivan Reitman's 1984 classic. This begins with people touring a mansion in New York that's haunted. We then meet a Erin, a writer who reunites with her friend/colleague, Abby (McCarthy), a scientist to seek her help investigating it and McKinnon plays Abby's odd assistant, Jillian. Soon, they go into business as paranormal eliminators and try to save the city from ghosts. Jones plays Patty, a subway worker who becomes part of the team and Hemsworth (Thor) plays their handsome, dim-witted secretary, Kevin. Charles Dance (The Golden Child), Andy Garcia (Black Rain) and original stars, Billy Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and Sigourney Weaver also appear. This isn't as bad as I thought, they tried to do their own thing while still pay tribute to the original and the cast, score & effects are pretty good as well. Give this one a try at least once."
" Not as good as the original, but has its moments
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"'Ghostbusters' is the reboot of a classic comedy everyone saw growing up, the 1984 original. This has a pretty similar plot - they're a bunch of nerdy outcasts, with Erin (Wiig) and Abby (McCarthy) childhood-friends-turned-scientists, Holtzmann (McKinnon) as the odd engineer and Patty (Jones) as someone with a car. When the under-developed villain, Rowan (Casey), starts transporting ghosts 'across the barrier', with plans to unleash the ""fourth cataclysm"", the Ghostbusters have to save the day against a giant ghost-thing destroying New York. Sound familiar?Kevin (Hemsworth) is their dumb secretary and gets a few laughs, but like most of the side characters, he's under-used and doesn't add too much to the plot - there's also Andy Garcia as the mayor, Charles Dance as a Professor, Matt Walsh as a Government agent, Zach Woods as a tour guide, Karan Soni as the delivery boy, and obviously Murray, Aykroyd, Hudson and Weaver appear in small cameos - almost pointlessly so. The CGI's bright and colourful and the tone's light throughout, even when all the ghosts are unleashed. It gets a little silly and over-the-top at the end, but wraps up neatly.It's not as good as Feig's other recent films ('Bridesmaids', 'The Heat', 'Spy'), but it does top 'Ghostbusters II'. Plenty of jokes, with most working, except McKinnon really annoyed me as the weird one-note character. Definitely feel like Wiig could've had a few more jokes. The film certainly doesn't tarnish the reputation or memory of the original - or match it for fun and adventure - but it doesn't necessarily add a whole lot to the Ghostbusters world/franchise either."
" GIVE IT A CHANCE
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,7,"Ok, so I went and watched this movie recently as I had never seen it before. I really enjoyed it. Yes, the original 1980s movie was a classic, but that doesn't me this one's going to be terrible. That's what I thought when I read the reviews on IMDB and saw their rating. Get over yourselves, people. Yes, Hollywood is weird lately, with their new take on Annie, this all-women Ghostbusters, and even Doctor Who becoming Jodie Whittaker. But that doesn't mean they're all gonna be bad. So, give it a chance.Also, the woman are good actresses, the CGI is amazing and the story is pretty funny and good. You should see Rotten Tomatoes' score of this movie. It's rated fresh."
" A real, real review of a MOVIE!
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,10,"This version of Ghostbusters is GREAT! Way too many people out there want to try and view this as maybe a 'sequel-ish' kind of film or some kind of commentary on society. Just stay away from that BS!This show is meant to be a comedy and it succeeds very well on that mark! The original was full of similar kinds of 'groaner' type jokes, with people in the theater when it came out just laughing their asses off at them. This movie has a multitude of moments like that! It's a great comedy with more than enough 'winks' at the original to make it perfect!If you watch this as a MOVIE, then you won't be disappointed. But, then again, comedy is a subjective thing, so your mileage may vary. As an original Ghostbusters fan (and theater viewer) this took me back to the that time where me and my friends just laughed out loud and came out feeling great! If this doesn't give you the same feeling, that's too bad."
" Not sure what happened it's just terrible movie
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,1,"I was little surprised Ivan Riteman had anything to do with this but looks like he did. I'm guessing he only got paid to allow it to be made had no input to making the film. I'm guessing he isn't concerned with quality of the work this is the result. I don't know what it is but the legends of movies making are too old to make movies, or direct them any longer. I was 15 when the original Ghostbusters was released saw it first night in the theater it was like magic watching Dan Aykroid, Bill Murray, and Harold Ramis they were my favorite stars. Like many movies made last 10 years the scripts have been utter trash this reboot of Ghostbusters falls into that category."
" Horrible
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,1,"So, so Horrible! I really have trouble finding the words to describe the abomination that this film is. All I can say is never ever pay anything to see it! If you happen to be bed ridden during a snow storm and you have nothing else to do and this film is free; I still recommend you avoid this film. It could harm you!"
" is no go
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,1,Is no good i see 30mins and no is Not Ghostbuster is Badgirlbusters!
" Paint by numbers, despite the great performances
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"Much like the first Ghostbusters, this movie relied pretty heavily on its stellar cast and some hilarious improvised moments. But the story itself struggled at points, the homages/cameos felt forced and the franchise-y-ness was a bit much. Basically, I would have rather seen Feig direct this cast in an original story rather than a paint by numbers affair. I still laughed - because how could you not with these stars? - but I would take this director's other efforts over this in a heartbeat."
" We Miss Harold
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,1,"When i heard that the Studio was doing a Ghostbusters remake i thought we'd finally see Peter Venkman, Egon Spengler, Raymond Stantz, Walter Peck, Dana Barrett, Louis Tully and Janine Melnitz once again....Yes you read correctly, i had either totally forgotten about the passing of Harold Ramis or he was still alive when i first heard the rumors (don't remember which right now).
Anyways out of respect to the old cast since they did cameos in the film i went to watch it in the cinema only to regret doing so.
This is Not a funny movie. It has a good amount of stupid jokes but nothing which you'd laugh about.
This is also not an adventure. The entire movie focuses solely on the cast with the ghosts being secondary at best. The result is the exact opposite we had in Ghostbusters and even Ghostbusters 2.
After watching the movie i feel really sorry that Dan Akroyd and Bill Murray took it to social media to promote this shadow of a movie. I honestly don't know if it was in their contracts or if they were paid to do so but disrespecting the fans that practically put you on the map with the original Ghostbusters by promiting this is not the way to go."
" this movie was freakin awesome!
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,10,Ok for the people who hate this movie is either retarded or just ur average troll first of this movie did kick major ghost ass and is what iv always imagined the ghostbusters to be like this! when the movie was over I was in tears of joy because I felt like a kid again! but with all there weapons in this movie was spectacular it just made more sense to me in the movie because the ghostbusters were on a low budget money cost in the movie so they build most of there weapons or gadgets from scrap witch made this movie really interesting. plus with the fact they don't trap the ghosts they just zap them with the proton packs and they explode witch makes this movie all the more interesting. so if u hate this movie again u most be really high or not a true fan to ghostbusters. I truly recommend this movie to any true ghostbusters fan and not the so called ghostbusters fan trolls. all the movie reviews on this site is suspiciously wrong.
" Paul Feig is a freakin' idiot!!
",2017-12-13 00:00:00,1,"Ghostbusters is not funny. After watching 40 minutes of ugly, unattractive, not funny women and men reduced to morons, I had to turn it off. I am not sexist and I have no problem with female leads, but this is not okay. This is man hating bullshit!! I didnt laugh once and the moment Melissa McCarthy showed up for the first time, I got annoyed. Then Kate McKinnon showed up and although she is hilarious as Hilary Clinton she is just not funny here. She is ugly and unlikable. Then we have the black woman, played by Leslie Jones: a complete stereotype of how a black woman behaves and racist. Not funny either. And don't even get me started on the new theme song. Al though Im glad they didnt use the original by Ray Parker Jr, this version made my ears bleed. I dont know how they convinced Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd to appear in cameos here. But now I just wish they would make a third real Ghostbusters movie, to show Paul Feig and those annoying women how it is done right. But that will never happen. I just have to erase this crap from my memory, like the remakes of Robocop and Point Break. DO NOT WATCH THIS!! NOT EVEN IF YOU ARE A MAN HATING FEMINIST LIKE PAUL FEIG!!"
" ""Safety lights are for dudes""
",2017-12-11 00:00:00,8,"Seriously, there's almost a 2 point difference in the average rating of this movie between men and women... The demographic which gave this movie the worst rating are males < 18 years old. Many negative reviews say the movie was sexist. That all the male characters in the movie were either idiots or jerks. Well, duh.And as if there were some other movie where there weren't any positive women characters in the move, they would also rate that movie a 1 star... Riiight.But enough of the negative reviews and maybe it's just because I'm in love with Kate McKinnon, but this movie was entertaining! There were enough witty lines and a decent enough story line to make this movie enjoyable. If you want to enjoy this movie, then it helps to have an open mind. If you already want to judge it because you're not into an all female cast, feel free to hate it."
" Like a parody of itself, doesn't work at all
",2017-12-11 00:00:00,2,"Wasn't even planning to watch this, but decided to go anyway.I have no problem with the movie having women as lead, I was actually very surprised to read the reviews here that people were offended by the movie not having ""attractive women in short skirts and long hair"". Now that is something I can't understand. There are some problems with this new take on Ghostbusters tho, because while it promotes ladies to lead characters, it also creates a lot of unbelievably dumb male characters. This makes the whole movie feel like a parody. Like a sketch stretched to movie length. The receptionist played by Chris Hemsworth is so over the top that it's not on par with any other character in the movie, even tho most are quite exaggerated.It's difficult to judge acting as it's constant joke after a joke. I'm not a huge fan of this machine gun verbal joking which isn't based on the actual joke, but to make everything a joke. If you say something, another character turns it into a joke and the other continues with some other variation of the same joke. I'm under the impression that most of the ladies are stand up comedians and SNL actors and it kinda shows with constant verbal joking. I think there even was a line at some point where one of them said ""is everything a joke to you?"" and that's exactly how it feels. On top of that there is a super clichéd ""black character"" and a super annoying character Holtzmann played by Kate McKinnon. Kristen Wiig is OK as usual and Melissa McCarthy is quite good too. The villain was OK, but lacked a lot of depth as the movie just focuses too much on making everything a joke.I found the many cameo's quite annoying too. It made the movie feel even more like a parody. In fact it's quite like ""Scary Movie"" version of Ghostbusters. There was one scene which could've been somewhat thrilling with a ghost standing on a characters shoulders, but even then they had to have someone take a selfie with them. A real Airplane! style Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker moment. There's nothing serious about this movie. What was good with the original is that it was actually spooky at times and the characters were interesting and likable, which they aren't here. The original was a perfect mix of good writing, acting, combining funny and scary and even the story was much more interesting. The fx are OK, I've read people put them down too, but they kind of fit the very colorful and bright mood and color palette of the movie. They're CGI looking, but overall I'd say they could be worse. But for the style they chose the ghosts fit quite well.A failure in every way to me. It doesn't really work as an ""equality statement"" either because the movie is just a joke playing for almost two hours. You can't hide a lacking script and characters with fart jokes etc."
" How Can You Have Four Women And Not One Of Them Is Attractive Or Cool?
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,2,"I fully know and am aware that the right-wing and far right-wing Trumpite elements have orchestrated a campaign against this movie on their sites, blogs and Twitter, and I absolutely hate to be associated in any way with those cave goons, but fact remains this movie sucked. It is bad enough that film after film is a remake, reboot and/or sequel (boycott the new boring Star Wars - aaarrrggh!!!!!), but now they want men to deny their own existence and their own instincts and natures and be interested in man-trashing, man-hating women who among the four of them do not show an iota of attractiveness.I know attraction is a subjective matter, but could we have one woman who has long hair, wears body appropriate clothes and flaunts some skin?? Hey, I go to movies to enjoy and that is what I enjoy. Would it kill you if one woman was capable of killing and capturing ghosts and was in a micro mini skirt? You can keep the other three in baggy suits. I understand if it is not possible, but then you understand that my $15 is mine to keep and won't be spent on your movie.Did anyone notice how annoyed the ghosts looked? Perhaps it was for being in this film or how stupid the 'Thor' dude was."
" When nobody laughed
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,1,"Humour and laughter is universal. Usually the most flawed comedies manage at least a couple of laughs. At some point something vaguely funny occurs and there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon for actual enjoyment.Sadly, in this case there were no such moments. I sat watching with friends and could here nothing but the light rain outside. We slowly began talking to each other, someone lowered the volume, and then the movie ended.I think Leslie Jones must be one of the most untalented persons ever to appear on screen. Regarding the others, this was just poor execution from start to finish. The dialogue seems forced, the women-vs-men aspect of the movie is tiring and reminiscent of some B-movie from the 80s.I suggest people simply watch the original instead. It's old but quite enjoyable."
" Oh dear, what have they done?
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,3,"Wow, Feminists and Social Justice Warriors have taken a much loved 80''s movie and have trodden it into the dirt.This is a feminist movie for and by feminists. It is not for anyone else.Terrible movie. If they wanted a female group of ghostbusters then by all means make something but don't ""remake"" ghostbusters with female characters instead of male characters, it's weird, really weird.Why could they have not just made another branch of the ghostbusters universe in which there is a female group, why did they have to tread all over the old ghostbusters because it had men in it?All of this aside, it is not a great movie, it is not a good movie, it is not even an average movie."

This definition of ""cultural appropriation"" pretty much outlines what the movie is TRULY about.This movie does not call for an actual movie review. It calls for an apology to fans of the original Ghostbusters, on behalf of the postmodern feminists who didn't take any perspectives before chewing up the cult classic and regurgitating 3 white women, 1 black woman, and half-ass-ed story, directing, special effects, ... etc... And for who, exactly???"

" This is what happens when agenda is more important than entertainment.
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,1,"This entire movie feels like a big giant political statement. ""Out with everything male, it's time for women to take control!"" That's what it feels like. The original movie got swept under the rug, the story rebooted and partially copied and the legendary cast of the original got replaced by a bunch of female comedians who fill the movie with quite lame improv. Everything that made the original so great is missing here. There's no soul, the comedy falls flat on its face, the CGI actually manages to be less impressive than the practical effects from the original, the writing is quite terrible and the movie is nowhere near as clever as the original either.It just feels like a very cheap and low effort knock off despite it having quite a big budget and a lot of effort put into it. Ironic isn't it?"
" Give it another chance...
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,7,"Wow, the reviews on here are harsh!! I saw this in the theater when it came out and I will admit that I wasn't too impressed, however I decided to get it for my 11 year old because we have and love the original films. I enjoy the movie more and more every time we watch it!First off, aren't most films a tad misogynistic in general?? I actually found it quite refreshing to see a ""male bimbo"" as opposed to a ""female bimbo"" for once. And for those that had a problem with the ladies hitting the bad guy in the crotch at the end of the film, I would absolutely do the same thing in a battle to the death with a male. I mean, come on now. Not to mention it was a ghost and not a real man, so....As for the cast, I really enjoyed their performances. Chris Hemsworth was ADORABLE, and has since been on my top 5. ;) I am a bit confused as to what exactly people were wanting Leslie Jones' Patty to behave like?? She is a black woman, and apparently the leads were improvising most of their lines, so I am assuming she herself made up quite a bit of her own characters dialogue and general personality. I thought she was HILARIOUS and no more stereotypical than Kate Mckinnon's ""quirky white nerd girl"". I think the best thing to do is to go into it with an open mind and don't expect Oscar worthy performances from a somewhat slapstick comedy. My family and I really love watching this movie together because it kind of works for adults as well as older children, and there aren't a ton of choices out there that I feel comfortable showing my preteen because of all the overt sexuality in pretty much everything. So I say give it another shot!:) Just watch for the subtle facial expressions, God I frickin love those women!!! :D"

I stopped after 30 minutes of the Extended cut. It's painfully unfunny, sexist, and terribly written. The biggest sin of this movie to me is that the actresses here are really talented. I love Kristen Wigg and Kate McKinnon. And I think I laughed at one joke in that first 30 minutes out of all the jokes they were dropping. Nice try Sony but it was dead on arrival. Don't patronize your audience when you want them to like your movie."

Unfortunately, we realize very quickly that the scenario is bad, absolutely no team chemistry within the Ghostbusters (they have nothing in common), scenario is quite bad, I am also not convinced by the actor play, and worst of all the movie is full of misandry. I get that they wanted to make a movie with girls, but all the male actors are belittled during the movie one way or another.

Kate Mckinnion is awful by the way also compare the stupid plot and terrible effects and dumb ghost design of this new awful awful flick with the amazing story and amazing practical effects and SUPER COOL ghost and monster design of the original two and this remake makes me wanna barf! THEY Shouldn't EVEN BE ALLOWED TO CALL IT Ghost busters, if they just called it like Ghost smashers and didn't try to ruin my favorite franchise maybe it wouldn't get such a bad rap (which is deserves) but when you use the original title and call it REMAKE you WILL and SHOULD be compared to the originals in every way so don't blame the public for THIS SHODDY MESS!! also everyone in this sham wanted to be the funny one, the original worked because Ernie Hudson, Dan Akaroyd and Harold Ramis were in character and let Bill Murray take the front of the comedic reignsI COULD GO ON but i think enough people already hate this movie which gives me hope for humanity"

" A Fantastic Film, A Delight
",2017-10-12 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this redeux of the 1984 classic thoroughly. That out of the way, what was most wrong with ""Ghostbusters""? For me what let me down a little was the final descent into the unblooming flower as I like to call it, when Abby rescues Erin and they ascend back into the real world via a ""rope"" of some fashion.It was much too personal. There's a line you shouldn't cross in a comedy between the comedic and personal, the most personal thing being a relationship between two people, obviously. For this climax to occur between two of the three Ghost Busters was exclusive of the others, which was the major shortcoming of this movie.From a masculine point of view, perhaps.I don't see this movie having a sequel. I don't think it requires one. It is great as a standalone. (I would like to see more ""Ghostbusters"" incarnations.) The comedy of the movie was on-spot and the girls were cute as buttons. I would give it an A+ if I had a grade to give.I did enjoy the ghosts. I think some may not understand just how peculiar the supernatural can be."

",2017-10-12 00:00:00,7,"This movie is far from the worst movie you have ever seen. It makes for a fun night out with friends, and it will definitely make you laugh. The four lead roles are hilarious, and they put a nice twist on a classic film. If you go in with an open mind, and you do not compare the film to the original, then you will not be disappointed. It is sad that it did not do so well in the box office, but I think that is due to the audience comparing the movie to others. Just take the chance and watch it for yourself!"

As the genre suggested there was not much of action, fantasy not very much but there is a lot to laugh. Some notable acting in this movie would be of Kristen, Mellissa, Kate, Leslie, Karan and Chris Hemsworth. The plot could have been made better I felt it was dragged in many places especially towards the end of the movie. The ending was predictable and I did not like it. I think there is going to be a sequel for this movie they have to make sure they have a good plot and proceed in making the sequel. Yes I would recommend people to watch this movie just for the laughs.My Rating 6/10"

Maybe in 5 years this will become a guilty pleasure.
" SEXIST! Travesty to be avoided
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,1,"Awful. I love the original Ghostbuster. There was chemistry between all the characters. But this movie is horrible. The 140 million dollars would of been better spent on the homeless that this travesty.The jokes are dull. The acting is dull. The men are mindless dunces, while the women are sexist brainiacs, that objectify the men. The black character is a typical stereotype angry, abrasive and rude. Avoid it. The ghost are all the same green glow. Waste of time watching this on dvr.The story is a rehash of Ghostbusters II, where an evil man wants to bring ghost to destroy and take over New York. I enjoyed dental surgery more than this nonsense."
" Some laughs but not the original
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,6,"With the way everyone talked about the new Ghostbusters movie and saying how bad it is, I did put the movie off for quite a long time. Then it finally came in the mail via Netflix. So, I watched it. And it definitely isn't the original (or sequel, for that matter), but isn't as bad as everyone says it is. I think the problem is everyone compared it to the original way too much. In this day and age when Hollywood can't come up with their own ideas, you will have people who do that. I'm not one of them.The main problem with the movie was the forced comedy. I personally think Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and Kate McKinnon are three of the funniest people right now. Not so much Leslie Jones. She just seems like she takes all the aspects of why people don't like her and tries to make that funny. I can't laugh at that, because it's not funny. But the movie had quite a few minutes where the comedy just seemed so force.Melissa McCarthy was in another movie that this happened in. It was Spy. In that movie, they did try to force laughter, but the one person who you wouldn't take for being in a comedy was the funniest person in the movie. That being the Stath himself. Here, Chris Hemsworth was easily the funniest person in the movie. Giving off that dumb pretty boy image was great.Then they had the forced cameos from most of the original cast. To me, that just says, ""we couldn't do this by ourselves."" If you have to force the cameos in there somewhere you're already in the wrong. Bill's was easily the best, but still. It didn't need to happen. At least you could have used their character names from the original.Other than that, I did enjoy the movie. Granted, they completely ignored the original and said they were the first to discover paranormal activity. The filmmakers seemed to want to make a standalone movie but also rely on the original. You can't have it both ways. If it was a standalone movie (I'm talking minus the cameos) the story was good. It almost followed the original with a few minor tweaks in there.Then there were the different ghost and what the visual department did with them. Having a Slimer family was quite good.The thing I really wanted to mention in this piece is the upgrades. I would love it if the world would go back to the time when technology wasn't so handy and everyone had a computer in their pocket. But the movie did bank on the upgraded technology by having new weapons for the Ghostbusters to use. Some of them actually looked believable as well.All in all, the movie wasn't as terrible as some people have said. But it's also not a masterpiece as the original is. Give it a go if you're feeling antsy, but don't expect the same spark the original has.Rating: 6 out of 10That's it for me folks.

" Worst insult ever to the fans
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,1,"Normally i comment a lot, i explain my self, i take references but for this i have only one word to say : P.U.R.G.E Avoid and run away. If you do not know the 2 originals movie RUN TO SEE THEM but in any case don't waste your time with this CANCER.This movie is a perfect definition How to kill an amazing movie Licence.I just have the feeling after watching this terrible purge of having been raped. Ghostbusters was for me a reference in so many ways but this one is simply an insult to any fans."
" A Real Review of Ghostbusters
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,4,"Let me start by saying this,this new Ghostbusters movie is not the worst movie ever released.With that said, this is not a good movie.This movie is one that the studio involved should have never been given the red light to make.Unless this movie Ghostbusters was going to have the original cast brought back for a third film, this franchise was finished a long time ago.The cast of this movie do mix and gel a little, but the story itself is terrible.I did laugh maybe twice watching this movie,but it was silly humor so that doesn't count.There are many cameos in this movie so that can keep people watching a bit .But without a script and story,I'm never watching this again."
" Ignore the remake perfectionist haters
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this film, lots of slapstick humour and lots of Saturday Night Live people, It's a fun film, people get all hung up on remakes but it's a different type of film and enjoyable to watch, me and a friend chuckled all through it, it's light entertainment and very good."
" I didn't laugh.
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,1,"OK,we're 75 minutes in, and I didn't laugh once. In my humble opinion a movie that advertises itself as a comedy should as at least make you giggle once every 20 minutes. I'm not going into the question if it's feminist agenda movie or not, it's Just Plain Bad. It's a shame IMDb doesn't allow a zero as a grade, otherwise I believe it's overall grade would be so much worst."
" Hellish.
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,1,"The original obviously has its fans but even if you try to ignore the sexual politics of the marketing campaign, the movie itself seems to detest its core audience, with the script often striking out at people who love the franchise and hatefully labelling people as 'man-babies' and 'basement dwellers'. A franchise that was loved the world over seems to have spawned a 'reboot' that is fuelled by nothing but hatred, and it shows. It's not a comedy. It's an overly-improvised excercise in bitterness. It's like being punched in the boobs by Paul Feig's angry sister."
" Rubbish
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,1,"I am not against remakes because sometimes they can be good like ""The Thing"" or "" A Fist Full of Dollars"" or ""Little Shop of Horrors"" etc But this was a pile of overrated rubbish that was made purely made to further an agenda of feminism and that women are the best and do not require men. This is purely a man hating film and tanked as it deserved to do. Some might say it was misandrist.What a waste of an opportunity to make at least a reasonable modernised version of a great film. Even the music was rubbish"
" Whoever ya gonna call, don't call the new ghostbusters!
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,2,"Wow, is this crappy or what? Downright the worst movie I have seen in a while. To add insult to the injury, managed to stumble upon an extended Blu-ray version which is 18 minutes longer than theatrical – whopping 134 minutes in all! Yes, this is the all-girls-remake of the 1980's darling ""horror comedy"" franchise, this time starring Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and, er, the other ones. Most of the original cast return with ""surprise"" cameos too, excluding, of course, the late Harold Ramis. This is just a sad fuckup of a movie where everybody tries and tries for two hours and more, but nothing worthwhile emerges. The only good thing I can think about the movie is that at least they have tried. For a long time, they try to make us laugh with their witty bantering dialogue and good chemistry but none of it materialises and the result is dead on arrival. Alongside ""Anchorman 2"" and ""Zoolander 2"", this must be one of the biggest failures of recent times, where they tried to bring back some cult classic and just fell on their asses. ""Ghostbusters"" is so bereft of laughs or joy that it feels shitty even by movies starring Melissa McCarthy's standards, who's still desperately trying to define and recreate this little magic she managed to create in her breakthrough role in 2011's ""Bridesmaids"". The same goes to Paul Feig, of course, who has mostly directed McCarthy's movies, the first and only creatively successful one being ""Bridesmaids"", of course. He should go back to TV world or something. Rotten Tomatoes' and Metacritic's reviews are far too kind this time, the most telling would be the latter's user score of 2.9 out of 10. The only bits I at least semi-enjoyed in the movie were original ghostbusters' surprise cameo appearances, and maybe Chris Hemworth as the good-looking but stupid assistant to the girls. He's the closest thing this ""entertainment"" had to offer to make me smile. The visual effects look cheap too, although this may be some kind of homage to original movies."
" Go your own way
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,5,"I gave this a 5. For the effort and the CGI. It was quite nice. It was even funny a few times! I actually laughed more than 3 times!But it was wrong and hollow. Not worth 144 million dollars. No nerve, nothing original, no thrill. I agree it's a remake, so original is kinda out of the question, but I expected more. I didn't get it. I only got lame humor and CGI.Women shouldn't imitate men. Not make female versions of whatever. Go your own way, like the Fleetwood Mac song!"
" An Unneeded Remake
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,7,"It's just not that funny. It breaks no new ground at all. Many cameos included an uncredited Sigorney Weaver. The special effects are good but so were those in the first two original movies. Actually too many ghosts! Again there is a crazy short madman trying to bring about the end of the world through the supernatural undead. I barely laughed at all. The worst film I have ever seen Chris Helmsworth appear in. Badly edited and 20 minutes too long. I like my ghosts to look more humanoid. That big green prehistoric ""bird"" with wings would give a young child nightmares for years. The only cute thing was ""Slimer"" cruising with his ""girlfriend"" in the Ghostbusters car. A sequel to this sequel? No thanks! Not the worst ""Sci-Fi-fantasy film of all time. That ""honor"" goes to both ""Dune"" and ""Lost in Space"", and maybe several others as well, from the early 1950's. I won't even waste my time examining it in detail."
" Like ghost hunting in a dumper.
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,1,"Cheesy, cringe-worthy and worst of all, unfunny. None of the actors come off as believable. The special effects are more cartoon than they are scary or even realistic, and the jokes are all completely forced. It's like they made a TV special for the Ghost Busters and only had a few days to produce the movie. If comedy could make you feel dirty (literally), this movie would be a possessed dumpster. You'll have to go back and watch the original movie just to make yourself feel clean again."
" It wasn't the best but not THAT bad either.....try watching it as a movie ...not a ghostbusters sequel
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,8,"There were 2 reasons for me to watch the movie. 1)Well...Ghostbuters! 2) Melissa Mccarthy & Kristin WiigI don't really get all the negative reviews. I saw the same movie everyone else did and I felt it it was good. I am still hoping for a sequel! :) I got so excited when I saw the old cast pop up, it was a like a little surprise. I wanted to see Slimer join the team but alas.. I would love to see them all together again with maybe a better written story"
" Why can't we give 0 stars?
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,1,This disaster did to Ghostbusters what the Phantom Menace did to Star  Wars.   Imaginative.  Unfunny.  Poorly acted.  Poorly directed.  Awful low budget CGI.  I hope this film is forgotten so that future generations do not  conflate it's existence with the awesomeness of the real Ghostbusters.
" Underrated
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,7,"It deserves better than a 5.3, which is the average user rating on the day I am writing this. Maybe fans of the original Ghostbusters films are trashing this because they don't think it measures up to the original. I have a different view. I think this female version is actually a little better. This one has more funny moments IMO and the four ladies are all likable. Wiig and McCarthy have most of the funny moments as you would expect. Kate McKinnon's character was over-the-top and a bit annoying at first but she grows on you. Leslie Jones did a fine job as well, but she's about a foot taller than McCarthy and McKinnon so it looks a little awkward when they're standing next to each other. Jones' motivation for joining as the 4th member also wasn't explained very well in the film.I'll give this film a low 7 rating. Definitely deserves a second viewing at some point."
" Perfect
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,9,Nothing wrong with it. I would say that the cast was funny and unforgetting. They seemed good together. Holtzmann was good and Kevin was awesome. More happened in this one so don't slag a good movie off before watching it. Female cast is just as good as a male one. If you liked Wonder Woman then how is this any different? I want to see a sequel to this.
" sense of humour had nothing to do with the original movies
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,2,"Being an original Ghostbusters fan, I did not enjoy this movie at all. The jokes were bad, sense of humour had nothing to do with the original movies. Did not like the script/story neither. Reading all the reviews before watching the movie I did not have high expectations but decided to give it a try. To cut the long story short, I do not recommend."
" Embarrassingly bad
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,2,"I strongly defended this movie prior to its release, when people spewed their hatred over it, due to the female cast. And I still defend the cast. They are excellent. In other movies, that is. A great cast does very little when the script is so bad that they don't get to show their excellence. It is incredibly childish, filled with fart jokes (and sure, who doesn't love a good fart joke, but they are just not good in this movie), slime vomiting, and general stupidity. Sure, they said that this was a reboot for a new generation, and if that is true they must assume that this new generation truly lacks intelligence. I've really tried to find some redeeming qualities in this move, but alas, I've not found a single one, except for the the brilliant choice of cast. But as mentioned, sadly, a bad script can make the best of actors look bad."
" Depressing and outright offensive
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,2,"As a huge fan of the original Ghostbusters I was willing to give this film a go. The advertising for it alone was a buzz kill for me, the whole ""Female centric"" and ""Girl power"" thing was completely unnecessary (Since when does that matter in a film?). I can't complain about the acting, the cast or cinematography they were all fine but it was blatantly agenda ridden. I interpreted all the male characters as either complete idiot buffoons or douchebags whereas the female characters are intelligent and quirky and what not. I have too many issues with this film but i'll only touch on a few. Lets start with the final boss *spoils ahead* the final boss was a personification of the original Ghostbusters logo, when i saw this it made all the ""This film ruined my childhood"" comments make sense. Literally the new Ghostbusters attack the image of the old Ghostbusters, rude much? To partially take down the boss the girls shoot him in the crotch, tell how that doesn't go along with the whole agenda thing. Men often are the focus of the jokes in this film, Chris's character being a big oaf who has the same number of brain cells as people in a monogamous relationship, the takeout delivery boy still manages to be late even when the busters live upstairs. There is no real connection between this ghostbusters and the original except for the name, the image and the concept of catching ghosts. The cameos were brief and understated. There was no passing the mantle to the new buster, the girls just incidentally invent all the same technology and images. I have never deadpanned through an entire film before. It just wasn't funny and i left the film utterly saddened by this failure of a reboot. I'll just stick to the originals."
" Swing and a miss
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,1,"I heard about the hate, but I wanted to see for myself. These people have been another shows. In other bodies of work they've been entertaining. This should have been a formula for success. This just proves how filmmaking is as much art as science. This is the film equivalent of primary schoolers making breakfast in bed for Mother's Day. This film clunks along through juvenile humor, like the new kid in school trying to make everybody like her by trying to be funny. It feels like it was written by primary schoolers. I tried to like this movie. I tried hard. I tried as hard as this movie tried to be funny. We both failed. Utterly. Miserably. So. Much. Fail."
" Boooooooooringgggg
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,3,"I was hoping that people were exaggerating with the bad reviews but unfortunately this is an average, boring and ultimately bad movie.The 90% of this movie is bad improvisation, unfunny jokes and useless dialogues; it's like they forgot to write a real script. They tried to copy a lot of scenes from the original, forgetting to add the little elements that made it a great movie.Some visual effects are great, some scenes really creepy and well made but they get lost in a mediocre story with a weak villain, annoying characters and too much useless improvised dialogues.Ultimately Ghosbusters 2016 is a failure: fans will hate it and new viewers will forget it in a few hours.Congratulation Sony and Paul feig for letting a lot of people down."
" Average fluff piece with a brilliant cast. Haters are beyond delusional.
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,6,"You have got to be kidding me. This is the movie that has caused so much hatred, rage, and controversy? This harmless, average, fun fluff piece? Pretty much everyone already knew if they liked the film or not before it was even released. I think a lot of people need a reality check not only on this reboot but on the original as well. Hailing the original as some sacramental divine piece of cinema that cannot be improved on is a complete joke. No, I don't hate the original. No, I don't love the reboot. They are both somewhere in between with the original barely edging this out in terms of filmmaking. If we were to rate comedies on their ""laughs-per-minute"" then the edge would go to this reboot.But how, when the special effects in the reboot are clearly superior? Turns out that there is far more to film technicalities than bright lights, pretty colors, and realistic green slime. Where Ghostbusters (2016) falters is in the editing and how the humor is set up. The film is too focused on being a ball-busting roller-coaster ride; rarely stopping to catch its breath. There are quite a few legitimately funny bits in here that could have landed even better if the editing was more precise. Silence and patience can work wonders in action comedies. Hell, just look at what Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton were doing literally one hundred years ago.The cast members are at their best when they aren't forced into doing line-o-rama improv. I found Leslie Jones and Melissa McCarthy to be the shining stars of this with Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon not far behind. McCarthy notably is a groan-inducer to most, but she does well in films that she or her husband did not write or direct (Spy, St. Vincent, and now this). Jones acts as the grounded everywoman who keeps the nutty ghost hunters in line, and for my money has the best comedic timing out of the four. McKinnon seems to have downed a few energy drinks before every shoot as she is incredibly extra in every scene, often more so than required. Wiig tries to bring an emotional backstory to the picture but it gets lost in all of the neon rainbow effects.If you're one of the few somehow still on the fence about this: give it a try. It won't ruin your childhood, or kick your dog, or kill your family. At worst you'll walk away unamused and then proceed to pop in the original."
" Might as well get mad at a donut
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,8,"Yeah, whatever. It's a special effects popcorn movie. If you like the actors -- and I was pretty entertained by McKinnon and Helmsworth -- then it's enjoyable. I'd pay to see a sequel because I think it would be fun.There's nothing here to merit a 10 star review. And nothing to merit a 1 star review. And yet, look at all those 1 star reviews. I wonder if it's possible that maybe they are all getting all worked up over a donut. Yeah, I think that's it. Bad donut. Bad."
" A few funny moments
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,4,"A few funny moments but not enough to carry the film.. Over-cooked special effects approach cartoon level.over the top with cheesy one-liners. Doesn't matter how deadly the situation, the comedy keeps rolling. The ""stupid guy"" Kevin character was overdone, as was other characters. As mentioned, there were a couple of funny moments in the beginning, but they faded away and all that remains is a movie I give 4 stars,"
" It's not that bad...
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,7,"This movie was made to entertain, period. It is not a movie that will make you question life and all of its' mysteries, but it will make you laugh. If you want to shut your mind off for a couple of hours, enjoy. If, however, you can't find humor in what isn't cerebral, buy a book. Preferably a textbook."
" Such Potential
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,6,"Not gonna lie, the trailer for this got me hyped. Heck, the idea of female Ghostbusters was cool to me, but not like it was to everyone else. In my opinion, there was nothing wrong with the original; the stars were the guys who wrote it, so they had every right to cast who they wanted, including themselves. But that is neither here nor there. I went into this movie hopeful. I am a huge SNL fan, so seeing Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon in this had me excited. I also think Melissa McCarthy is pretty darn funny as well. With a roster like that, it had to be good right? Yeah, about that... To start off, I had no reason to dislike this film. I'm not biased either way, I don't have an agenda. But from a purely objective standpoint, this movie was not that great. It has some redeeming qualities, but overall it missed the mark for me. Let's start with the acting. Normally, I like Kristen Wiig. I loved her characters on SNL, and I loved her versatility in movies like ""The Skeleton Twins"". But this movie is a prime example of why her film career has been slowing down. Wiig has a great ability to play diverse characters, regardless how weird, and to OWN them. But it's an ability she has not been using lately. Her characters keep hitting the same note of being cute, awkward girls who can't seem to reach their goals, but can pass the time by making crude jokes. There is very little difference between her character in this film and the one she plays in ""Bridesmaids"". Eventually, doing the same schtick over and over gets old, especially when you KNOW she is capable of more. Sadly, the same goes for Melissa McCarthy. God bless her, her character is more diversified than Wiig's, but it still feels like an archetype we've seen a hundred times by now. It's just not memorable. These characters would work in another film, but not in ""Ghostbusters"". What made the original work was the diversity of the characters, and their individual, fleshed-out quirks. In this version, there aren't any quirks, the characters are just sort of awkward for the sake of being awkward. Luckily, Kate McKinnon comes in to show them how it's done. Without her, the movie would have been a lot worse. McKinnon's character is memorable and enjoyable, with a delightful weirdness that she seems to bask in. She so fully embodies her character that its easy to sit there and wish you could go have a beer with this person just to see what she would do next. She is by far the best part of the movie, adding a splash of color to an otherwise drab cast. Now to the writing. What we get is not really a BAD story, but it feels rushed. It doesn't feel as though there was a lot of effort put into it, aside from making sure that certain markers were hit that are present in other ""Ghostbusters"" films. Sadly the story is less about the final conflict and more about showing how the team comes together and starts doing what they do. But we didn't need that. We got a well-paced origin story with the original, and an examination of the difficulties with the sequel. So much of this movie did not need to be devoted to the working life of the team. You can show those things, of course, but not in such a way that you make the ultimate conflict of the whole movie feel tacked-on. But if I had to guess I would imagine things were paced the way they were to allow for the inevitable improvisation that would occur while filming. Again, rather than setting itself apart as something different, this film just falls into the same trap as a lot of comedies these days, where the script is a loose guideline, and a lot of the humor is simply added as things go along. Sometimes this works, and you get golden moments, but sometimes it's overdone, like destroying a whole mountain hoping to find one nugget of gold. The original was scripted and written well, and while there was surely some ad-libbing, it didn't dominate the script. It would have been so refreshing to see that thought-out considerate humor here, revived, but instead we get more of the lowest common denominator. It may have worked in other successful films, but those weren't the films they were supposed to be paying homage to. On another positive note, I will say that the effects were good. The ghosts were spooky without going full-on horror, and I only wish they would use something similar in a Scooby Doo outing in the future. The spirits we get to see are some of the most memorable parts of the whole thing. I may not remember all the jokes, but I remember the gorgeous/terrifying woman in the library. It was also great to see the original cast come back for cameos. I don't really consider it a stamp of approval for the movie, but I can't deny I got excited seeing Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd show up. It served as a sort of pick me up as I watched. What it all comes down to for me is what I wrote in the title; there was potential. You can see it as you watch. The actors are talented, even if they don't bring it to bear here, the effects are good, and the story could have worked if they had used more inspiration from the original and given it more structure. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but if there's something strange in my neighborhood, these aren't the Ghostbusters I'll be calling."
" while some effort and risk went into this movie, it didn't pay out enough for a nostalgic gender-bend
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,2,"Sony, trying to bring the nostalgia back from the 1984 movie of the same name, decided to reboot ""Ghostbusters"". full of forced jokes, bad acting, and other issues most bad reboots have. One of the biggest issues with this movie is it's over use of CGI. Almost everything that can't be used as a prop was made as CGI, with the exception of ""one"" ghost that used a drone. of course this is a trend in modern day earth, where CG is widely accepted as ""the future of digital entertainment"". This next bit may sound sexist, but it puts quite a bit on the line. Turning the main leads into females just ruins the whole ""nostalgic"" bit of rebooting this movie."
" Not that bad. Actually entertaining.
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,7,"First of all I love original Ghostbusters. I have DVD's, Ecto One car and Peter Wenkman figure. And honestly despite the love of those films I have, They are very goofy and cult level movies at the same time.They are not Oscar movies.But they have class. The new one is not a great movie. But an entertaining one .I laughed a few times and wondered whats gonna happen next scene. Which is not every movie pull it off these days. Yes there is overacting. But there is a lot of new thing bring this movie for franchise. Fight scenes are much more intense. Villain is actually understandable. And he has a logical (in movie standards) plan and motivation.He is a nobody and he wants be a somebody.Simple but so most people are. Maybe a little backstory give him more character. Cameos are some them OK some of them unnecessary. Don't get me wrong. This film has flaws and plot holes. Overall, this is not a bad movie. It's a enjoyable popcorn flick. So sit, watch and enjoy the movie. Hope they will make sequel."
" Somewhat funny, but lacking in plot
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,5,"After reading all the bad reviews about this, I went into this expecting a train wreck. The only reason for watching was to see just how bad it could be. With such low expectation in mind, I didn't find it all that bad. The girls are funny on occasion. A lot of jokes do fall flat, but there are decent ones mixed in that makes this made this movie somewhat watchable. Although one thing that weakened the comedy a bit was the way they made the girls the best in the world in their fields. It clashed with the self depreciating humor. The story it self made little sense, and I had a hard time following it, or understanding the motivations of the characters. This didn't hurt the movie in the beginning. As the story progressed, it starting to become a bigger problem. I was a bit bored and hoping for the movie to end in the last third of the movie."
" It was amusing
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,7,"So I watched this on cable TV. Given all the bad reviews I was not going to watch it at the cinema or rent it. I, personally, think that if you put aside the original (assuming you're old enough to have watched it) that this movie was fun. The special effects were fine, the four lady leads worked well together, and there was a sweetness to their efforts. Chris Hemsworth played an idiotic receptionist really well. Did it take away from the original? No. Did it pay homage to the original? Yes. Look out for cameos including one from the Marshmallow Man himself. I thought I would hate it, but I had a smile on my face. Do I miss the old four ghost busting men? Yes, but I have the DVD. This was for a popcorn flick, not a bad effort. Why the hate?"

",2017-07-11 00:00:00,10,"This movie is one of my all time favorites. The women in it are hilarious and have posed as role models for young girls to look up to. Not only does it tell a great story, but it serves as an inspiration for women and girls to do the unexpected, exceed expectations, and pursue their wildest dreams."

",2017-07-10 00:00:00,10,"I grew up watching Ghostbuster with my dad. It was one of our favorite films when I was a kid. When I heard there would be a reboot I was ecstatic. I mean, how come more Ghostbuster be something bad? And it was AWESOME! I laughed so hard all through the film. I watched it many times after that. The jokes are on point and the scares are there too. I loved the characters and I related to them even more than my beloved original ones. I loved Melissa McCarthy as the leader of the gang, she had hilarious one liners. Leslie Jones is a personal favorite. I relate to her character the most, because I'm not much into science, and I do study history a lot as a hobby. And she is so funny (the moment she enters the Mannequin room cracks me up EVERY TIME). Of course, Kate McKinnon steals the show. Her character is so kooky, it's impossible not to fall in love. I totally recommend watching this film if you like fun and laughing. I don't see how so many people are upset about such an entertaining and pleasant film. Please, don't be led by misconceptions and watch this film with an open mind. I guarantee you will have fun!"
" Rating speaks for itself 10/10
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,10,"As a longtime fan of the franchise, I was skeptical of a reboot. Alongside others, I didn't think the original needed a rebirth, but I decided (despite the tragic reviews on YouTube which, come on, all of us know YouTube comments are a cesspool) to see the movie anyway.And I ABSOLUTELY LOVED ITI don't think I've laughed that hard in a theater in years. I'm still laughing. The movie had all the nostalgia of the original with some fresh gags, funny as hell slimming's, an interesting origins story, truly iconic characters (Holtzmann is a household name in many places, that's a damn fact) women in STEM, and a riot of a good time. It was hokey in the best ways, running with slapstick unique to the comedians playing the lead roles. Those who cried and kicked their feet don't have a leg to stand on in my book. True GhostHeads dig the material, and the nods made to the founding cast was equally delightful. Don't think of this as a rebirth or a reforging of the founding 1984 giant. This is a fresh universe with fresh faces that gives a lot of hope to girls and boys everywhere while being hysterical and more than a little crass when the mood hits. Definitely something I will watch many times to come"
" Harold Ramis would be happy.
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,7,"I hate writing movie reviews. But I have to. This movie is much better than the paltry average user review value.When I watched the movie, I was expecting a ""meh..."" rehash of an old successful script (of a movie I liked) re-purposed to extract a female audience. Sit through the movie, acknowledge the heritage and then go home. But this movie would have made Harold Ramis happy. There's the original movie's wit, sarcasm, and confrontation of the micro- conflicts of life, like wonton soup quality fluctuation. When the movie veers from the easy path of the original movie, they make a funny point: Like the exorbitant cost of the fire house as an office, vs a more humble and affordable headquarters.I almost always like Kate McKinnon and Kristen Wiig. But I'm normally less enthusiastic about Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones. So I was just hoping for a C+ team of main characters. Instead the whole team was perfect. Some other reviews complain about Jones' stereotype role. But her character was often the sober voice of reason when the other three were ignoring risk. Jones played a strong, ambitious, reasonable character. (Sounds like some people can't handle that.) McCarthy stepped into her role and projected the determination her character needed for credibility. Other actors who did really well: Cecily Strong and Andy Garcia were very good. Chris Hemsworth was appropriately flighty.There were cameos with a tip of the hat to the original movie. Most of the cameos I caught while watching, but a few I had to notice in the on-line credits. (Free marketing suggestion: ""Cameo Bingo"" cards.) And the many throwbacks to the original movie were done with a wink and/or a nod, often with a snarky twist. I thought it was all very tidy.Is this a guffaw torrent, tears-in-your eyes, wet your pants laughing movie? No. Neither was the first one. Both were funny, clever, innovative, and at the end you were glad you watched. I'm not sure the 2016 movie will spawn the same volume of quotable lines, but we'll see. The movie definitely exceeded my tepid expectations and the actors surprised me in a good way.Now I could take the coward's way out and accuse all the severe 1- star critics of the movie of being immature men who can't handle women being invented, forceful, fearless, and successful. And the that's exactly what I'm going to do. Sorry so many guys have problem a with women as peers or superiors. I'm just guessing that their anti-women attitude will be an increasing self-assigned burden as their life moves forward."
" Embarrassingly busted
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,5,"There are so many things wrong in this ""reboot"" of the ""Ghostbusters"" franchise that I won't waste my time trying to point them all out.""Ghostbusters"" (1984) was a light-hearted comedy. It didn't make you laugh every 30 seconds, but it gave out that feeling of being entertained. ""The Real Ghostbusters"" (1986) animated series was a great mix, some episodes were like a laugh every 30 seconds, others were dark and spooky and some were even touching (after all, most ghosts were living people, at least once!) ""Slimer and The Real Ghostbusters"" (1988) animated series was really bad, showing that not everything ""ghostbustering"" was gold. ""Ghostbusters II"" (1989) was another proof of that, it reused the same story as the 1984 film, only replacing Zuul by a somewhat powerful ghost, and the fun for boredom. ""Extreme Ghostbusters"" (1997) animated series restored much of the lost momentum, with its dark mood and sharp humour, and could have been a wonderful stepping stone for the cancelled ""Ghostbusters 2000"".Then we get this ""Ghostbusters"" (2016), a more-or-less direct remake of the 1984 story, replacing Zuul by a sociopath. I laughed more with this than with the original, but that didn't help. By the end of the film, I couldn't remember the name of a single character! Most funny jokes came from the engineer of the team, an obviously stoned woman that is a mix of Egon Spengler, Raymond Stantz and Otto (the school bus driver from ""The Simpsons""), that is, genius mad scientist at its best, and worst. The leading characters (I guess, cast to resemble Oliver Hardy and Stanley Laurel) are not funny, from beginning to end... At all!The fourth ghostbuster is something else: in a rock show scene, one of the ghostbusters threw herself on the crowd and was carried away, to which the fourth one tried the same, falling flat on the floor as the crowd cleared away, commenting that she didn't know if they didn't pick her because she was ""black"" or because she was a woman, all she knew was she got really upset. The fact that Winston Zeddemore was the only ghostbuster that was not a doctor and that he was the only non-Caucasian character on the original 1984's film couldn't have been better expressed. For that one scene alone, I raised my rating by two stars!The special and visual effects are lame. While on the 1984's film, the cartoonish looking proton beams worked fine, they are simply embarrassing on this 2016's remake. And talking about embarrassing, when did it sound like a good idea to add a dance scene to a Ghostbusters' film?! From sociopath to dancing clown, that was a great fall for a villain... And they dare reprising it while the credits are rolling...""Rebooting"" the Ghostbusters' franchise with a female cast was a good idea, as some jokes seemed to work better (although I would have preferred a female and male mixed team, like in ""Extreme Ghostbusters""), but the excessive use of curse words, the man showing his middle finger (for too long) and other annoyances spoiled the fun... And that dance scene, what the hell?! Maybe that was his plan all along, kill the survivors by embarrassment..."
" Compare with the original this is just garbage.
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,1,"Awful attempt to bring back a classic from the 80s. The choice of actors for the characters is just poor and awful. The story line is just awful. Just plain boring. I feel bad for whoever paid movie ticket price for this movie. I'm surprised this movie is rated 5, should be rated like 2 or 1."
" A disgrace to the uniforms.
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,1,"My favorite movie of all times (yes, i said it) is the 1st Ghostbusters film. I've watched it on my VCR dozens of times back in the day when i was a kid, and i'd watch it again with anyone who wants to have a good time today.By looking at the cast of the 2016 film i already knew it's going to be a disaster so i avoided it. A few days ago it was on cables and against my better judgement i actually tried watching it. as expected, this thing was a trainwreck. I barely made it to the 20/25 minute mark and couldn't take it anymore. It wasn't remotely funny. the actresses are beyond terrible.Wayyyy too much pseudoscience nonsense and i even hated how they had to add lighting effects to the proton packs and the PKE meters. it looked really bad. not to mention all the new devices they come up with (that was the part where i couldn't take it anymore- when they test drive the new gizmos).If you're here to check the reviews do yourself a favor and avoid this flick at all costs, and if you never watched the 1st GB movie, make sure to add it to your bucket list :)"
" Not the sequel/reboot we hoped for, but a good bit of fun
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,6,"As a huge fan of the original movies, like the millions of others I was very sceptical about this reboot and whether it would stay true to the formula. It does to an extent, but it also adds in a lot more. Remember that the whole reason for this movie was to open it up to a whole new generation and audience, and I think it has done that well. Younger kids will really enjoy it. Sure the plot is silly, and the humour is a bit mundane and forced at times, but despite all of this I enjoyed the movie and it was just a good bit of fun to watch, original movie sentiments aside.It was a big flop at the box office so only time will tell if any planned sequels come to light. If not, then it's no big deal. The franchise has had a great run. If so, then I'll watch them and try to remain open minded. So my advice is: watch this with an open mind, and you'll have a good time."
" Offsetting unfair 1 stars - deserves about a 6
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,10,"I can't believe all the 1 star reviews here. This is definitely not a terrible movie and certainly not the worst. It deserves around 6 stars. The script had some one liners that could have really fallen flat had they been handled by a less talented cast. For the most part, the acting was pretty good, especially by Melissa McCarthy. There were a couple lines that didn't quite work, but it wasn't terrible. The cinematography was very well done and there were enough humorous moments to make it enjoyable."
" Feminist garbage
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,1,"From the onset this was promoted as a sort of a feminist retake on the original classic comedy, a ""women can do better than men"" attempt. It is a horrible premise to begin with, attracting a lot of negative publicity before the movie was even out. And it delivered.. badly. Mediocre acting, bad script, lukewarm jokes. It does not deserve a further analysis for being so mediocre, a five out of ten movie that gets one star for promoting a pointless gender competition. Next feminist projects could be: ""The Terminatress"" , The Blues Sisters, Beverly Hills female cop, Fay Buller's day of, Iliana Jones, Billie and Tess's excellent adventure , etc, etc.."
" Saturday Night Live - The Movie
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,4,"""Ghostbusters"" is an American movie from 2016 and this made quite some waves as it is the newest movie about the world's most famous ghost hunting agency. They intentionally did not say it is a sequel or remake, but just another film that takes place in the same universe. And actually the story here is so different compared to the old Bill Murray movie that it would not have made any sense. It is not just about the protagonists being women this time, but also about motivations, backgrounds and eventually also the ghosts of course. They made some interesting decisions as this film felt on many occasions as one of its main challenges was to not make the fans of the original film angry as it really worked as a tribute with the mention of the song, the spray painting of the logo or other references as well. You will recognize them when you see them. And another approach in keeping the fans calm is to include the original actors in cameos and this is done here too. Oscar nominees Aykroyd, Weaver and Murray of course are all on board and play pretty small characters that are not really significant, but it gives the film a bit of an aura that the old cast approves.The director here is Paul Feig and he is also one of the writers. I think that there are segments when he did a good job and that there are segments when he didn't. He worked with Melissa McCarthy on several occasions in the past already and here we already have the name of one of the Oscar-nominated actresses in here. The other would be Kristen Wiig who is somewhat in the center playing the main character if you can say that even. And then there is Kate McKinnon and (for diversity) Leslie Jones. If you read these names, perhaps you will also understand the title of my review as these are all actresses who have appeared on Saturday Night Live, 3 of them actually as regulars, so it is a bit of a family affair. Anyway, the first half was solid if you manage to ignore some really bad jokes when the film hit rock-bottom when Melissa McCarthy (who else) talks about farting out of a vagina. Guess she always needs a bit of fecal humor in her works and it really hurts the overall material. You may think that with the bad guy gone around the 90-minute mark the film could be over, but of course it is not. Actually in the extended edition, the one I saw, it runs for a massive 2 hours and 14 minutes a lot of which are closing credits however. But still, some cutting it short probably would not have hurt the film as towards the end, it almost feels a bit of a collection of huge special effects and explosions and ghosts everywhere, but it does not reach the fun factor it tries to. For all I care, they don't need to make another Ghostbusters film with this cast and crew as this first one we have here was ultimately nothing special really and I give it a thumbs-down. Neither the performances nor the script not the comedy were really on a level that I would call memorable. Cannot recommend checking it out."
" Descent/Non-Misandry Comedy that does not measure up to a Ghostbuster
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,5,"BEWARE AGAIN: SOME SPOILERS ARE INCLUDED!!! Ghostbusters (1984) is my all-time favorite movie. I love the sequel, the 2009 video game, Real Ghostbusters series, Extreme Ghostbusters series (which contains a female Ghostbuster), and the comic series (also contains female Ghostbusters). Like all the other fans, I waited patiently for over two decades for a third movie to see the light of day. When I heard the series was going to have a reboot showcasing an all-female team, I was actually quite excited. Especially when I learned it was being directed by Paul Feig, who gave us the buddy cop comedy The Heat, starring Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, which I deeply enjoyed. But knowing Paul Feig's work, I knew the new film would deal with social issues involving feminism. In my years in the entertainment industry, I have learned one lesson: if you are producing a project that involves heavy themes or social commentary, the story and characters all have to be genuinely good to emphasize the lesson. When they are not, the movie will fall apart completely, and the haters will come out in swarms. And that is what happened when the first production stills, showing bland aesthetics with the Ghostbusters gear, were released. Along with the theatrical trailer - which was one of the worst crafted trailers ever. It looked as though the publicity department hated the film so much, they decided to sabotage it. This caused a huge backlash among worried fans and trolling misogynists. But long after the movie was released and hearing all of the horror stories saying this movie is a man-hating, waste of ectoplasm, I finally sat down to watch it. And my final answer is: not bad. Funny. Definitely not offensive. But it does not measure up to the name Ghostbuster. Most of the reboot's moments come off as what you expect with an SNL script, and not relying on the subtle, deadpan humor which was Ghostbusters' calling card. Secondly, there are zero elements of spooky horror, which is another part of the Ghostbusters saga. The chemistry between the team was there. Unlike the trailer's depiction, Leslie Jones was not the African-American stereotype that everyone was worried about. The main actress who I thought was out of place was Kate McKinnon. Her portrayal of female Egon - Jillian Holtzmann - was so badly telegraphed, she came off as an SNL stock character rather than an honest, Brainiac human being. Chris Hemsworth's secretary character, Kevin Beckman, is an obvious attempt of turning the stereotypical dumb blonde trope on its head. Chris did an amazing job, but his character is so over-the-top and out of place, you can never see this man actually being hired to fill in the shoes for Janine Melnitz. While Ghostbusters' original development team was rooted in SNL and improvisational theatre, the production avoided all attempts to include SNL tropes, and it was that inhibition that gave it so much power. By far, the funniest elements were Bill Murray's cameo and Slimer. Bill plays a TV-celebrity expert who makes his living debunking paranormal claims, and Slimer (near the end) steals the Ecto-1, going on a joy ride with his Slimer-like girlfriend. And those are the main highlights of it. But because of all the movie's shortcomings (including over emphasis on CGI and Scooby Doo effects) along with emphasizing the feminist message, people like me were worried about something deeper. While there were genuine misogynists who tore into this movie, people like me felt trapped. We were left believing that if we came out saying this movie was not that good, we would be branded as misogynists ourselves. Which is why it is so essential to make sure the story is good before dealing with social issues. But in this reboot's defense, it is definitely not full of misandry, unlike what some reviewers claim. One of their main examples is in the final battle when the team shoots the main bad guy (the ghost of a paranormal genius who takes on the form of a large, menacing version of the Ghostbusters logo) in the groin, in order to get the antagonist to let go of the side of the buildings and fall into the ghost portal. They say the groin shot is an attack on men, which is a load of ""ghostly mucus"". For starters, the groin shot trick is nothing new. It has been used to great effect as early as the 1990's. Paul Feig's work has never been focused on hating men, but with empowered women working hard in a world where men are the shot callers. Paul even used the groin shot gag in some of his other movies, yet no one screamed misandry over those incidents. The fact they hold onto the groin shot as an example of misandry is not only troubling, but kind of hypocritical. They get angry when a female Ghostbuster shoots a male ghost in the old Johnson, but laugh when Ray Stantz has a dream of a female ghost unzipping his pants to perform fellatio. So in conclusion: decent acting, fun moments, non-offensive, but finds itself lacking. Worth a viewing, but nothing more. Us Ghostbusters fans will have to keep waiting for an entry that will truly please us."
" Don't watch as a Ghostbuster sequel
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,1,"If this was a random movie, I would've probably given it a 6. It's not that bad, although it tries to be funny without succeeding that often.Thing is, no one would have watched this if they didn't sell it as a sequel to Ghostbusters/under the Ghostbuster franchise.As a sequel to Ghostbusters I or II, this is absolutely awful. In every aspect. I wanna die it's so bad."
" The only honest review
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,5,"Even though this review is called the only honest review, I am sure that the majority of people here are going to agree deep down, a sort of summing up the general experience.I'll start out by saying that I am tired of the political stigma surrounding this movie - I don't give a rat's ass about most of the stuff people choose to be offended about, so I'll just steer clear of that. In this way, I am probably like most guys on IMDb, so I am confident that this will reflect the user base. And just to be clear, I not in no way bothered by the fact that it is women who play the major roles in this movie - it's just that men play all the minor ones. Also, they tend to be portrayed as downright stupid, or they only say silly stuff, which is not very common when we're speaking of a comedy. This was slightly harrowing to me, and I can only describe the experience by using the term 'reverse sexism', a choice of words which clearly shows how little I care when the 'ism's are directed at anything other than what is white and male. (otherwise, I would know that the correct term is simply 'sexism').The acting sucked, even though I usually like Kristen Wiig. I'd say that Chris Hemsworth saved the movie and should be the lead actor in the next Ghostbusters, where they will make America great again. The music and CGI was fine, though I was a bit bothered by all of the neon lights. I wasn't alive when the original Ghostbusters came out, but it was truly a masterpiece that I of course cared about way before I saw all the headlines advertising a ""female Ghostbusters"". The plot was a bit meandering, and I probably wasn't the only one who was a bit bored by the time they got to portray the villain as a male basement dwelling nerd. All in all a sour experience. Look up the ratings for this movie, and you will see how it was subjected to a down voting brigade before it even came out in theaters,(I'd tell you the password to my 4chan account if it wouldn't put me in immediate danger, as I am very proud of my contribution to keep the SJWs from taking over the world) and now, the ratings are slowly being re-balanced. Worrying, it is. If only people could take entertainment for what it is, huh?"
" woeful
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,1,This is by far one of the worst movies ever made.....OK to be fair I haven't seen it but somehow I still hate it. That is powerful. I do not hate any other movie I have not seen. Also this is the first time in my life I have taken the time to leave a review for anything online. I hate this movie so much not only have I not seen it I have also wrote a review on how much I hate it. There are no words for how much I hate this movie.
" our library put this DVD in the ""family"" section
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,1,"yep. this was just awful. and how do you explain to a 6 & 11 year old about what Ozzy means by having a flashback? other then saying he's having a drug flashback. and kinda glad it ended then and there. but still. i can't believe that they put it there. that must mean they never watched it.so i ended up subjecting myself to this turd again with the first commentary track on the DVD and learned nothing. other then whoever their test audience was, must have ate too much of the drugged laced popcorn.i will sit through the second commentary track before i take this back. but wow. this really was a stupid movie. and i like a lot of crappy stupid movies. but this has got to be the worst one of them all. and i like stupid funny comedies. but this just failed on the funny part and was just a stupid comedy. i hope like hell they don't make another. but i'm sure all they see is money.actually, you know what this reminds me of. the same idea about how this flopped is kinda like how a band can start off strong. and then it totally goes for a nose dive after. that's because all this time was say used to put all the best stuff on the first album. and there is such a huge demand that the company wants another. so they got to crank out another one as fast as they can. so sometimes it can either be as good, or better. but ever stop to think that maybe that's because the creators have had lots of time to make things perfect because they had all this time before hand to fine tune that. and then say the one after is a total flop because the demand was too high and then whatever crap comes out ends up being the worst thing they ever did. because the demand is way too high, and the end product suffers due to the overwhelming demand."
" A cheesy light show stuffed with sexual innuendos and nerd culture
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,1,"Like the equally cringe-worthy Suicide Squad, the Ghostbusters Remake puts up a lot of bright colours, thrilling music and the latest in computer effects, but in doing so, it only makes itself look dated and corny, something not to be taken seriously even as a comedy. But what surprised me wasn't even the technical aspects, but the bizarre focus on political correctness and feminism, which didn't really have any purpose in driving the story at all. All of the Ghostbusters are female (and I'm a girl myself, so I'm not trying to be sexist), and the only guy in the group is a man who makes Forrest Gump look like Stephen Hawking, a boy toy who gets hired mainly for his looks and accent rather than his actual skill. Meanwhile the film's antagonists and resident idiots are all men, including a ""supernatural debunker"", a sociopathic janitor and a closed-minded university professor, all of whom are made out to be complete jerks and morons. And don't even get me started on the ""ghost crotch"" scene in which the protagonists defeat the enemy. Why... just... why? With this film being in the 21st century, of course it tries to be as lewd and crude as is permissible for its rating, slipping in fart jokes, pen!s jokes, sexual innuendos, breast jokes and everything else under the sun, which seems to be trying to be subtle yet painfully obvious. We have one of the characters describing how ""ghost slime got into every crack of her body"". We have a nuclear device which makes a fart noise as a joke. I'm not trying to be some uptight prude, but this simply wasn't funny, in fact I'd be shocked if even an immature twelve-year-old found this stuff funny. It wasn't really offensive per-say, just stupid and dopey with very little originality.The soundtrack was okay I guess, with some 1980's throwbacks, but the introducing of modern pop and rap tunes into the mix didn't do anything to help matters, nor did the constant stream of nerd culture and the main characters' pathetic personalities. I hated the main leads except for Patty (Patty was at least tolerable). Their attempt at being quirky and eccentric just falls flat on its face, and we're left with an overweight geek who makes a crass joke in almost every scene and who seems to make no real contribution to anything, and of course the bleach-headed inventor who seems to be a rip-off of Harley Quinn from the Suicide Squad franchise, trying to act edgy and seductive in a dangerous way, but instead appearing awkward, mentally ill and annoying at the best of times.The trouble I have with this film is that it's frankly very ugly and tacky in every way. There's nothing wrong with comedy or with having a silly movie that everyone can laugh at, but this was just plain dumb, there's no way to sugar-coat it. Honestly it did have potential; the New York scenery was excellent, the camera movements were spot-on, the more minor characters were for the most part well-acted - so where did it go wrong? I think with Ghostbusters, its fault was that it tried too hard to be cool, only making itself geeky and lame in the process."
" great comedy
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,10,"It was great to see McCarthy depicting a smart yet funny character; I find her over-the-top, grotesque roles in some other movies truly off- putting. McKinnon gave a refreshing performance, and Wiig, though downright typecast at this point, was still good. As of today, this title has an average rating of 5.3/10, which really baffles me because I think it's a great comedy. Sure, some scenes feel more like SNL skits than movie scenes, but they are hilarious so I don't mind. The humor, both verbal and visual, is mostly smart and tasteful except where Kevin is involved. Then again, I don't mind that that either because Chris Hemsworth.Definitely recommended."
" What's with all the bad reviews
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,8,"Not a bad film at all. You must remember that this is Ghostbusters, not some deep drama. The effects were fine, and acting as well. It does not deserve all those 1 star reviews. (Why do you have to write 5 lines to submit, stupid, less is more! I have given my opinion with a few words, informative for others that see all bad critics, that should be enough.)"
" I Wanted to like it
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,1,"Despite the ironic last line in the movie being ""It's not terrible"", this movie was terrible. I started watching the movie knowing the poor reviews it received and was hoping since my expectations were so low that I would find something to like about it. I found almost nothing that I liked about it. That's unfortunate because the cast was a group of stellar comedians. It's almost like the writers tried very hard to make them not funny.The story was choppy and had me disinterested throughout the entire movie. The only thing that kept me watching was for the potential humor that I knew the cast could breakout at any moment. That moment never came. The movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be an exact copy of the old movies or a brand new take on the whole idea. Unfortunately it ended up being somewhere in the middle and failed miserably in the process. I went into this movie with an open mind thinking that most of the bad reviews were written by people that didn't like the change from male to female lead characters. It turns out the bad reviews were by people that like good movies and this was far from one of them."
" If it ain't broke don't fix it
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,2,"This movie almost made me want to kick myself. I was WAITING for it to end on the inside of my body. The humor is so bad this movie shouldn't even be under ""comedy"". I literally took a break from the movie and went with my mom and sister to the doctor came back and pressed play. The movie is also poorly edited in some ways like that scene where the motorcycle explodes and when you can see the one lady (Didn't remember her name because it is that boring) running from the mannequin. In one of the movies first scenes one of the main characters is talking to themselves in an empty college classroom and then starts shaking her butt for no reason what so ever. I also paused at the scene in the dean's office, what the heck was that guy even wearing and what was that decorating. Finally, it was a disgrace to the old crew that Bill Murray's character Dr. Heiss I think the name was, is attacked after one of the girls release a ghost on him, but he was offered the part and took it and it makes him money so good for him I guess. Gave it 2 stars because it follows the plot of the ORIGINAL movie that should have been left untouched. The acting and humor of this movie is just cringe-worthy."
" Cheap and Hackneyed
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,3,"I cringed when I saw the first commercials of this ""new"" Ghostbusters shamelessly trying to be PC with the gender reversals. And after trying to sludge through this bland rehash, my first impression was validated. This is an as-usual Hollywood ""production"", bereft of new or original ideas, trying to repackage something that was 10x better 30+ years earlier. The effects are fairly cheap, and the story is a complete rehash with a fall-off in humor. Cameos litter the whole dump. So many of these older 80s movies that are getting remade are done in such cheap, unoriginal fashion, the movie industry had better take note. There is a certain disrespect for when newer remakes are so shamelessly thrown together. 3/10 -- Crud."
" No no no no no!
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,1,"Words can not describe how terrible this film is, I would go as far and say that this incarnation of Ghostbusters destroyed my childhood memory of the classic Ghostbusters films. Everyone involved with this film should hang their heads in shame for ruining a film that could of had such potential and rebooted the series.Acting is terrible, the plot is none existent, I genuinely hope I can erase my memory of watching this film, and just remember how good the original films where."
" I liked it
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,6,"As a stand alone film it's OK if you avoid comparing it to the original classic.I can't believe people are incensed enough to write such long winded rants. Is it a great movie? no! Is it likely to win an Oscar? Certainly not.I enjoyed it and I especially liked the cameos from the original cast but in fairness, if I had paid good money to watch it I too would have been annoyed.Unfortunately it does belong in the reject bin with all the other reboots and poor sequels such as Independence Day and point break but it certainly watchable."
" 2nd worst mistake of my life
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,1,"Having heard many things about this movie and seen the trailer, I finally decided to watch is. Thinking back on my life, I believe I've made 2 HUGE mistakes : 1st one was marrying my now ex-wife. 2nd one was watching this movie.Filled with stupid ""jokes"", quotes and references this movie attempts to reintroduce us to a newer version of the Ghostbusters movie I loved as a child. Some claim, that this is ""empowering women""... sorry, but it does the opposite. It dumbs down the women, and I will teach my little daughter, that women CAN be scientists... They DON'T have to act SO stupid as seen here."
" Writing lets this movie down
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,4,"Watched it tonight after avoiding it for the longest time. I liked the original but I found this version to be just okay. My opinion is that the writing and the jokes were lazy. In the original the characters took the job seriously and they had to work to just capture one ghost. In this one they were slaying ghosts right and left, making a mockery of the storyline. The acting was decent, given the script. But there is no overcoming the poor writing."
" All I can say is sensitive drivel
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,1,Ghostbusters is one of my favorite films in 1984 this one is not even a film it's disgusting it's badly written and acted it's sexist towards men as it is very offensive with jokes that actually made me angry that these women could say these things about men and get away with it but if turned around it would of Been front page news I think this Melissa Mccarthy person is a very offensive woman with too much to say about men but should look in the mirror before picking on people's physical features this film is very off from start to end avoid it
" Wow, I can't even watch the whole movie on Starz
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,3,"When it first came out it was so over hyped and marketed and with as well as the reviews I skipped it. Just watching clips on YouTube of last Saturdays SNL is so much funnier than than this. For a majority of it being a SNL cast it is so sanitized and makes SNL look like a M rated series on network T.V. compared to this garbage.So many one star ratings but come on, the Haunted Mansion with Eddie Murphy maybe, but this, I don't know. I never review movies with watching it through but this is almost impossible. I could just see it as dumb but with the wasted talent involved and their sense of humor it feels like a kid summer show. Ugghh. It's on pause but on I go with it."
" This is terrible
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,1,"I wanted this movie to be decent. But it is absolute garbage. I watch his movie from start to finish without laughing at all, and find myself cringing at the acting that was happening. There is nothing at this movie brings that is worth sitting through an hour and 59 minutes. I'm not quite sure what Kate McKinnon's character is supposed to be she walks around like she's got some lame legs and she cannot walk normally and if you watch closely you see her constantly smirking and laughing at her own stupid lines. Don't waste your time"
" I gave it a chance
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,9,"To start off, I did not like the original Ghostbusters, so I was already going into watching this movie with a closed mind. And the first time I watched it, I strongly disliked it for the same reasons I disliked the first ones, cheesy cgi, cheesy jokes, just a big cheese fest. However, I'm a fan of Kate McKinnon, so I decided to give the movie a second chance, and really paid attention to the characters and the story. And I liked it, a lot. I have since seen it 5 times. Which is why I'm making this my first review on IMDb. This movie got a lot of mixed reviews, and I think anyone scrolling through and reading them, should know it might just need another chance. The jokes were funny, the all-female lead cast was amazing, and ""Kevin"" was definitely perfect as the dumb blond. Give this movie a chance, and maybe even a second one, it's worth it."
" The Movie Never Surpasses Being Generic, but it Goes Lower Too Often
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,1,"Ghostbusters is a remake of the classic movie of the same name, and it follows a group of scientists who believe that ghosts exist and set out to stop them from taking over the world/Manhattan. I can think of few saving graces for this film. One of them is the fact that the humor did land on occasion. Specifically the humor around Chris Hemsworth's character tended to be, while dumb, entertaining.The other of which was Kate McKinnon. Of all the performances in the movie, it was clear that she was having the most fun, and as a result made the movie at least slightly more bearable. I get the feeling she read the script, realized how bad it was, then thought of the paycheque and rolled with it. While all the other actors seemed to be taking their roles way too seriously, McKinnon just seemed to be having a good time. As far as flaws, Ghostbusters has far too many. While McKinnon is good, her counterparts are awful. Like I said, they all take their roles way too seriously, and even then they can't pull off good serious performances. And again, while some of the humor was good, most of it was just plain bad. I saw the attempts and sighed at how generically horrid they were. Every joke you expected to be pulled was (yes, including fart jokes). In addition to bad acting, the characters were just dull and uninteresting. They were built around stereotypes and barely fleshed out. Wasn't this movie given a full-female cast because of the sake of progression/feminism? Then why is it that the black lady is the street smart one? That's a stereotype, I thought we were trying to get past that. The writing makes the movie out to be heartfelt and investing, but it simply isn't. By the end it acts like the audience has really gotten to know and love the characters, when in reality the amount of development given to them was so little that it makes me wonder if the writers even tried, or looked through the script again to make sure everything made sense. And it wasn't just the regular amount of generic 'heartfelt' stuff, the movie kind of overdid it to the point where it was just tedious. Probably the worst part of this movie though was the climax. It was so ridiculous, and it came out of nowhere. For a movie sporting a 116 minute run time, you'd think that the plot would be well-fleshed out and developed, but it's far from that. The ghostbusters themselves catch maybe 2 ghosts before the climax starts. And even then, they primarily go after the small ghosts. I don't know what could've been going through the characters heads. There are giant ghosts everywhere, why are they going for the little ones stealing food from hot dog stands? And then there's this big battle royal at the end that goes on far too long, makes far too little sense, and is far too ridiculous. Then we're bombarded by generically bad heartfelt scenes that are supposed to create tension but fail to. If there was a breaking point for me anywhere in this movie, it would've been as soon as the climax started. And to top it off, the ghosts themselves are flawed. They all seem to have inconsistent abilities, from passing through walls and car doors to being able to sit down in the car physically and drive it. If they can't interact with things, how do they drive? This is just one example, but it really doesn't make any sense throughout the rest of the movie. Overall Ghostbusters is just awful. It refuses to reach above its genericism, yet pretends to do just that. It's not all that boring really, but there are just so many bad things about it that those flaws just stack up, ultimately making this just a terrible movie. I'll leave it at that. In the end I wouldn't recommend it."
" Worst Ghostbuster Movie
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,1,"Crappy story with nothing sensible, utter nonsense ! Graphics look cheap, like some world of warcraft game graphics. Then there is crappy performance from crappy actors spare Chris Hemsworth who has done a good job as always ! Melissa McCarthy is a huge disappointment. This is the worst Ghostbusters movie ever. Don't waste your time over this movie, watch one of the old ones if you must."
" Great Homage and Funny too
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Hate to ""deBarge"" in, but you are gonna love this film! Went to see this with my sister, Aunt, and nephews; we all laughed and enjoyed the film. I loved the cameos, send-ups, 80s references, and hilarious comedy from some great comedic actresses. I was thrilled to see a great female leading cast, and a movie that smashes the Bechdel test, even if Erin has a mindless crush on ""Thor."" Great cinematic values, special effects, and performances, with a script that wasn't too terribly formulaic. A great ride, fun popcorn movie night, and suitable for the family."
" Holloywood needs to quit remaking classics and start something fresh
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,4,"When I heard that they were remaking the movie Ghostbusters with female cast members, I admit that I was actually looking forward to it, specially considering the four particular actresses they had chosen for the part. I understood that movie remakes are typically the greatest, but considering the fact that 3 out of the four cast members are currently or were once members of SNL, I had some hope. Unfortunately, Wigg's comedic talent wasn't able to shine with her boring character with a lack of personality, McKinnon's character was just upright stupid and unrealistic, Jones's character was just a black stereotype, and McCarthy's role lacked character as well. Many of the jokes just fell flat (Steve Higgins small role and joke with the middle finger, the won tons, Kevin's (aka. Chris Hemsworth's) logo scene, the thing with the hair dye at the end, and so on). Also, the had many references to the original ghost busters throughout the film, and yet I suppose the setting takes place in a universe where the original squad had never existed, it's like a slap to the face to the original cast. Sure they had Bill Murry and few other actors for the older version show up in a few small parts, but they play such tiny roles, and as different characters..And what's the deal with remaking older movies with female actresses or poc as the main characters. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Hollywood wanting a bit of diversity in their work, but they're doing it all wrong. While this movie has good intentions when trying to cast female members, I guess either to have more representation for younger girls to look up to or show that women are equal to men or whatever, but when they try to do with a remake of a movie that was already amazing, it only makes matters worse. This movie will be forgotten within a few years from now, unlike the 1988 version, which most people had at least heard of reguardless of age before this one. On second thought, this movie isn't trying to create diversity, they're doing this for profit. They know that with the adults and their nostalgia these days, and with the younger now being obsessed with the classics due to them being conditioned to think that everything from their own generation sucks (which is clearly saying a lot about the older generation ironically, they're the ones whom produce our movies, not us), they can get some quick and lazy bucks by bringing back a film that should've been left alone in the first place instead of thinking up of a new script and story (that of which could also have female and/or poc leading characters), because they know people are more drawn to things that they are familiar with (as was I obviously). Whatever, I'm so done with remakes. There are many movies out there in today's time (yeah they exist) with original plot lines that are currently or were recently successful in the last year or so, so why watch a crappier version of a movie you've already seen before?"
" not too hard to watch... if you've got a good distraction
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,2,"so decided I'd bite a bullet and watch it. after about twenty minutes i grabbed my laptop and booted up age of empires 2 this made the experience a lot more enjoyable. The plot isn't bad, it could be any ghost buster film. it's just the jokes where terrible and over the top the tone was way too light when someone dies in an extremely brutal way instead of cutting there or showing revulsion they just make a few jokes. The secretary character seemed to be too stupid like it wasn't funny it was cringe-worthy, it made me think that if this person was alive he wouldn't be able to operate from day to day. this made it really hard to suspend disbelief. honestly the final act was crap they gave away the majority in the trailers so there weren't many twists you didn't see coming. the only thing that really redeemed it for me was that it gave me time to play some age of empires 2. just kidding although that was probably the best thing about watching it the plot behind it wasn't too bad"
" Fun, and over all good times.
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie has made my personal top 10 list of movies.The acting I felt was not the best, but they made up for it with funny jokes, and good chemistry between characters.My only problem with this film is, the people who gave it bad reviews even though they had no reason to.They claim that the jokes were bad and it did not fallow the original ghost busters, blah blah blah. That's because this movie was supposed to be a new story with different characters,and even made cameos to people in the first movie, like patty's uncle."
" Don't Even Pretend this Movie is Funny
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,1,"The most fun you can get out of this movie is from shoving the DVD cover up your a*s. The jokes are unfunny over-attempts at humour, a far departure from the original's subtle situational humour (and yes, I will compare it because the creators chose to give it the same name). The characters are nearly all obnoxious and unlikable in almost every way. Jokes continue far past their expiry dates with not only the joke being included but normally a second joke about said joke followed by a commentary and reaction from the cast members. I was honestly willing to give this movie a try despite the backlash but even still it is a terribly written, cg-stuffed mess of a movie."
" Harmless fun, great women characters
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,9,"I loved the original GB movies and it's great to see the format updated to include four awesome women. It's fun and a bit retro, true to the earlier movies and with other nice references including Buffy. There's no plot, other than the obvious, but who cares - it's just harmless fun. Appreciated the cameos by Bill Murray, Sigourney, et al, giving their seal of approval. It's sad that all the misogyny and outpouring of hate following its release means there's unlikely to be a follow up."
" No Question, I Had Difficulties Watching This Movie But It Is Not That Bad
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,5,"After watching this I came away with two major gripes that put this movie below the original 80's version. Let it be clear that I am also not a fan of the original by any means as I rated the first a 6/10 and never had the interest to even try the sequel. So the first big problem was all of the forced one liners throughout. There was simply too many and barely any of them fit the flow of the story. That is probably why the original was so well liked because they were able to blend comedy into a lite supernatural drama. I'm fine with the movie being a clear comedy as at times I did find myself laughing at some of the lines.The other gripe I had was the weak clichéd villain. You would think that a big brand movie like Ghostbusters would cast someone a little more well known in the role than a former SNL writer. His performance just felt lackluster and I doubt audiences really saw him as a real threat at any point during the movie. Besides him, Bill Murray, and Leslie Jones also seemed to bring pretty weak characters to the screen. I have no idea if Bill Murray was forced to be there but it sure looked like it. Jones just appears to be a one trick pony when it comes to her characters but that hasn't stopped Kevin James (yep, random shot taken), so I'm sure we will continue to see her for some reason. The other three leads also had cringy moments but also some funny scenes that I guessed balanced their scales. Oh and then there was Hemsworth who I thought I would despise given the trailers but turned out to bring the comic relief in an otherwise cringe comedy.So, just to sum up my overall thought this movie brings a lot of cringe but I can't honestly say that it is a whole lot worse than the original. They are a lot different in tone though. If you want a supernatural drama with sprinkles of comedy then avoid this. If you want a full-on comedy which could be compared to the New Vacation movie or Will Ferrell's recent movies then this could be for you."
" Okay film, disappointed at humour.
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,7,"The film was overall interesting and catchy. But I was sadly disappointed with the humour, especially considering the cast included Melissa Mccarthy and Kristen Wiig. It was slightly humorous though I thought it would be a lot more funny. That was the only negative thing, so altogether the film was good."
" A fun movie that had me laughing.
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,6,"Let me just start with a little sidenote: I watch and rate A LOT of movies and I RARELY ever write reviews on IMDb (probably mostly due to my laziness). But I thought I would attempt to put forward a level-headed review for this movie since some of the other reviews here are seemingly so incredibly extreme and polarizing. (Frankly, some of these reviews sound like they are either being written by crazy people or by people who don't really watch many movies.)Let's skip to the end - the Bottom line: If you're a person that hasn't seen the original movies, likes comedy paranormal/sci-fi, and likes the actresses in this film, then you should at least give this movie a shot. (IMO, you would have to be a pretty serious person if this movie doesn't at least make you laugh out loud a couple times.)If you're someone on the opposite end of the spectrum who LOVES the original movies (and perhaps the 80s cartoon series as well), if you DO watch this movie, try going into the movie with an open mind and try to understand what this reboot is trying to do; this movie isn't a piece of fan-service created solely to please the die-hard Ghostbusters fans that grew up in the 80s... this movie is a comedy and a vehicle for reviving the Ghostbusters franchise... updating it so that a whole new generation can enjoy ghostbusting. (And to people who love the Ghostbusters franchise, that last part alone should be a wonderful thing to you.)Is this movie perfect? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Is it even amazing? Not really, but...... at the end of the day, I found this move to be entertaining and funny (mostly due to the infinitely likable and charismatic Kristen Wiig and also because of the great quippy dialogue between all of the main characters)... and, IMO, too many movies these days often can't even deliver on one out of those two premises!"
" Super fun
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,10,"Wow, I am so surprised by the number of negative reviews. This movie was exactly what I expected, done in the same non-serious manner as the original. I loved the cast, and thought they were hilarious. Chris Hemsworth was a riot, too. Or maybe my mommy brain is making me think this is a fun and funny flick. In any case, don't expect a strong, plausible plot. It's Ghostbusters, after all."
" I liked it
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,9,"I really don't know why there is such a negative opinion out there on this movie. Not only did I think it was good, it continued a franchise that I absolutely love and loved. I wasn't crazy about the idea of the change from a male to female cast, but I like all of the actresses that played in it. Not only that, but Chris Hemsworth is actually funny. There are numerous nods to not only the original movies but the cartoon series and I remember loving that as a kid. Lets face it, I can't imagine not loving something Frank Welker was/is attached to. It also had some zingers that I didn't catch the first time. I liked it. My son went bonkers over it."
" So bad that it hurt!
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,2,"The politest thing I can say about this Ghostbusters remake is 'why??' The original was mediocre at best, but fun for its time and had a great comedic chemistry between the actors. In this remake, the main characters actually look embarrassed. I thought we would see some remarkable CGI or a new twist to the old story, but sadly this didn't transpire. My advice? Don't waste your time or money."
" Just not funny
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,1,"This was a painful watch. Nearly all the 'jokes' fell flat (#goodjokesmatter). Dare I say it the male characters Kevin and the mayor made me chuckle a couple of times - being male, maybe that makes me sexist ? Kate McKinnon's character was particularly bad. A truly cringe-worthy performance. On a positive note - sounds like there won't be sequel!"
" I Loved This Movie!
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,9,"I was thoroughly entertained the entire time. I loved this movie! I watched both Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II a number of times through the years but never enjoyed them as much as I did this remake which I thought I might hate being how I felt about the originals. I am a super Melissa McCarthy fan, but not so much for the other actors in it. I thought they all did a great job though. I usually don't care for remakes, they are never as good the the original, but this remake is an exception. The originals were witty and entertaining but this was laugh out loud to me numerous times."
" Unfunny Destruction of the 1984 Cult-Comedy
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,3,"""Ghostbusters"" (2016) is one of the worst remakes ever made and an unfunny destruction of the 1984 cult-comedy. This female version is terrible with awful performances of the four humorless overrated lead actresses Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones that might work for stand-ups for American audiences, but have no capability to lead a worldwide blockbuster. Chris Hemsworth is not a bad actor and it is hard to understand why he accepted to perform the role of Kevin. Money probably (or certainly). Seth Rogen would be much more appropriate for this ridiculous role. The curriculum (or filmography) of the director and writer Paul Feig is enough to show who he is. The story is an atrocious combination of ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Godzilla"" with an absolutely annoying soundtrack. The only thing worthwhile are the state-of-art special effects. The cameo of countless people such as Sigourney Weaver, Andy Garcia, Ed Begley Jr., Charles Dance, Bill Murray, Ozzy Osbourne, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Elizabeth Perkins among others is a poor attempt of giving the fake status of cult to this garbage. Indeed a disrespect to the fans of the 1984 film. My vote is three.Title (Brazil: ""Caça-Fantasmas"" (""Ghosts Hunter"")"
" How to trash a fantastic saga in ten lessons
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,1,"When the trailer of this thing was released, I knew it was to be a truly bad movie. I didn't go to the theater nor buy or rent to watch this travesty. Instead I've decided to watch it for free and I'm so glad I didn't spend any dime on this trash!As a woman and great fan of the original films, I feel trashed to see that Ghostbusters has been torn to pieces just to push Paul Feig and Sony CEO's flawed feminist agenda for everyone to see. How could they dare to do that to the millions Ghostbusters fans who grew up watching Peter Venkman, Ray Stanz,Egon Spengler and Winston Zeddemore busting ghosts in a very delightful,funny and inspired way? Shame on them! They should never be in charge of a movie again and despised by the film industry for the rest of their lives!Now let's get to the bottom of it and show you how to destruct an amazing legacy and blow it into oblivion shall we? 1) Get rid of the funny and inspirational tone of the original movie. Instead fill it with flat-lined jokes which would make everyone telling them embarrassed to have even open his/her mouth.2)Make the Ghostbusters pass for a bunch of frauds by the whole city of New York and shamelessly make them feel okay about it. I should remind you, Paul, that the TRUE ghostbusters, the ones we love and will always consider as the ones and only, were REVERED and celebrated. But as I suspect you never watched the movies, I guess you never had a clue!3) Associate the original cast to this disaster through pointless cameos just to bury them down a little more. A nice way to tell the world how a bunch of class acts Paul and his SJW friends at Sony truly are!4) Add some superfluous gadgets and weapons which are doing nothing but taking off the magic of the general story frame. Peter, Ray, Egon and Winston were just scientists doing their jobs with their own talent and guts. Here we have a team of super soldiers taking out ghosts with grenades and dual weapons. PLEASE!5) Make this movie a display for pushing your agenda even it's terribly flawed. As a woman, my take on Feminism was to prove the males that we can be as able as them in their fields of expertise. It was never about making men looking like stupid and useless jerks and make women looking like Rambos. And my hat is off for the ending: Shooting Rowan in the crotch to take him down. That's classy!6) Add a lame and pretty dull soundtrack to the overall, throwing away the little magic left in the tank. I'm pretty sure a lot of us fans would have loved to hear the original theme rather than this mix of techno, rap and pop you put on.7) The fact that they have all they need to catch the ghosts but they lack a containment unit. What are they supposed to do? Dump the ghosts in the Hudson river?8) Hire a cast which is as lame as the script. My special mention to Leslie Jones who is truly annoying in this film. So her only asset to get into a team is because she can get a car from her uncle in the hood? Yeah sure maybe she could fund the team with some cash from some business made aside as well hmmm??9) Make Ecto-1 losing all its charm with that ugly big yellow light coming right from the 70s and remove the so familiar siren to replace it by a completely inaudible one. For once I was glad you destroyed it at the end of the movie.10) And finally my biggest point: Show the utmost disrespect for the entire fan community by constantly denying our remarks and branding us as misogynists when we only wanted to make this movie better. You have to understand that many of us were waiting for this third installment to come along. All we wished it was to be the greatest possible. But instead you saw us as the sheep who would just go see this pile of garbage because of the Title. Well I didn't and I'm very glad you didn't receive any dime from me. And I'd like to say you should be pretty ashamed to bring your herd of trolls to give great reviews and shut us down once again just to give yourself some good publicity you TRULY don't deserve.On that, HAVE A NICE DAY like we say in New York."
" Worst film of the decade
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,1,"What can I say, everything about this film was awful. The actors, trying to be funny and failing miserably, terrible script, 90's effects. I tried to watch it 3 times, and couldn't get past half an hour. I think when they started breaking into song was the last straw, it had to go. I would rather rub lemons in my eyes for 2 hours than watch this again. Maybe if you were 5 years old, you may find this amusing, but just watch the original and skip this one.Just think about all the people you could get off the street for $160,000,000 rather than produce this rubbish."
" Absolutely terrible!
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,1,"When I was a kid in the 80's GB was one of those iconic films. It was weird, fun and exciting. True to form in this day and age, the remake comes along. I've seen remakes of plenty of movies: total recall, clash of the titans and the day the earth stood still. These movies were OK, just run of the mill average but that's what you come to expect with a remake nowadays. So, GB was showing on Sky so I thought yeah I would give it a go, probably 6/10 territory like the previous remakes I've mentioned. Holy sh*t was I wrong. This films is simply awful! The script is naff, the acting poor, the SFX rubbish and the comedy non-existent. I honestly have to say, what the helm were yet think? How can they ruin a cult classic from the 80's??If you give it a go, like me every 5 minutes you will think, it will get better but it doesn't. One of the worst films ever! What a waste of time, effort and money."
" Great!!!
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,10,"Halirious! This movie was awesome... great sarcasm! Enjoyed this movie, loved how witty it was. The actresses in this movie were funny and witty! I think too many of these reviews are comparing this to the old one... instead of taking it as it's own original movie. I definitely recommend this movie, the humor was excellent and loved the storyline!! I hope they make a second one."
" Lame
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,2,"First Kristen Wiig really looks like Jennifer Aniston to me in this film. Second, I really hope Chris Hemsworth got some big bucks for this film. Third, Melissa McCarthy needs to play other characters besides Melissa McCarthy.The first Ghostbusters was fun. Adults could enjoy the clever jokes; and your kids could laugh and giggle at the silliness. I certainly couldn't take my grandchildren to see this update. For one, it just wasn't funny. Why bother to try a reboot if you can't even make it fun. Louder doesn't make it funnier.Leslie Jones is quite good; and as far as I can tell, the only member of the cast who can act. She actually brings some depth to her character. Kate McKinnon is just embarrassingly bad. Even her mugging for the camera is bad. Melissa McCarthy can act: I've seen her performances in St. Vincent, The Heat, Identity Thief, and Mike & Molly. She can bring humor and sympathy to a part. Here she is a shrill one-note boar. And Chis Hemsworth is there to provide tongue-in-cheek payback for all the women we have seen in vacuous roles over the years. And there are some clever nods to the first Ghostbusters. But this film is seriously bad. This is the first time my wife looked at me and said, sorry, but I can't take any more. And she walked out.I didn't expect to see CGI of the quality of a Marvel picture; and it was OK, just enough for what it was: a comedy ""horror"" film of mostly froth. There was even an appearance of Slimer for the aficionados. But you can't deal with criticism with the excuse ""haters gotta hate."" Or here come the misogynists. It was a bad script with poor direction and some abjectly bad acting: Neil Casey and Andy Garcia for two; and a number of wasted cameos also.Maybe the comedy bar isn't very high anymore and people actually roar at Steve Higgins giving the bird to Kristen Wiig. But what do I know, a number of ""parents"" noted how their ten and twelve year olds laughed and laughed. Maybe that just says it all."
" Message to Hollywood
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,2,"You are running out of ideas and losing the plot and the audience. this is commercial and existential suicide. Stop with all the sequels. It is retarded.Thin, sexy, flaunting and long haired women are beautiful. Don't hate on them. That is discrimination.Not everyone is stupid. There are some audiences that are smart and can accept and enjoy a good original script.Whoever green lighted this flatulent project should never work again. Put him or her in a pod with JJ 'Hack' Abrams and ship them to Kentucky or some dump forever."
" Busting Success - Haters need to stop - Going be it a try
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,8,"All I really want to say is I really enjoyed this after initially thinking I would absolutely hate it. It is a very good film in its own cannon, I love the subtle hints back to the originals which you would expect to see in the film.I readily agree it is not as good as the original but give it a tryKate Mcinnon for me is the best part of the film, she is hilarious and really hams up her part to the max, and as a group all the women in the main leads give very good performances too lending humour and good actingGo on , try it , you might like it"
" This movie should be condemned
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,1,"$144,000,000 seems a little pricey for a unique fixer upper re boot, but overall what did I think? I think this movie should be condemned. There's serious humor fatigue from all four cast members, the writing is substandard and is completely inadequate to my nostalgic needs and the CGI is like a PS1 zone ."
" Average. Not A Great Movie.
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,1,"Ghostbusters was average. Not a great movie. Kristen Wigg, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnion didn't have good on-screen chemistry. The acting was bad. Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon were annoying. Jillian Holtzmann (McKinnon) looked as if she could had been the offspring of Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and her character behaved like she had ADHD. Chris Hemsworth provided some good comic relief and he did have his moments. The film had some good nods and references to the original film. Some of the film was funny, but silly and some parts of the film I did find funny and did make me laugh. The film wasn't scary. Only 1 scene made me jump. The ghosts weren't scary and Slimer was badly computer animated. Ghostbusters is defiantly not one of the best films of 2016. I didn't think think it was as bad as Deadpool and Batman VS. Superman: Dawn of Justice. But it's defiantly one of the worst films of 2016. It lacks the magic of the classic 1984 film and it could had been better."
" Simply...
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,1,"I wish this film had never been made.I now find myself having to refer to Ghostbusters (1984) as the original - something that grieves me greatly, as this film and even Ghostbusters 2 were great films, compared to this. And the former is one of my all time favourites.I'm just glad I didn't watch it at the cinema, and therefore didn't have to pay anything to see it.This film runs like a series of sketches, which are then force fed to the viewer, rather than simply being funny in-of-themselves as part of the actual story. Whilst the cast are very funny people in other things, in this - the chemistry of main group is rushed, half- baked, and therefore unbelievable. Compare that to the dynamic of the cast in the original, and it's like comparing a picture your kid did with some great work of art. It's not even worth going into detail over, because the faults in this movie by comparison are so many and obvious, as to make all comparisons pointless and any real in depth cinematic critique an excercise in futility.If you feel you want to see it, I would say do so by all means - but borrow it or watch it for free, do not pay for it. The makers of this film don't deserve the money and the people involved deserve no credit.As previously stated, this is a film that simply shouldn't exist."
" Awesome movie unrated version best
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,10,They should have used the unrated version at the theatres without all the foul language. My husband and I both think this was better than the original and he grew up watching ghostbusters as a kid. Its clean humour every scene is funny and unfortunately they put the best movie on blue ray. The unrated is like an entirely different and more thorough movie.It seems they chopped the movie in half breaking up its character building flow and lots of of funny scenes were deleted.We love this movie I sure hope they make a sequel:)
" It Sucks...That all I have to say
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,1,"Are you kidding me, even Ghostbusters rip off films or YouTube movies are better than is garbage. What were they thinking, the movie sucks, the trailers, the posters suck, everything about it sucks. I don't mind that they are girls, it is time for a change, but it was so wrong, the jokes were not funny, the lines are terrible and all over they suck. There are 4 dances in this movie, why!!!!!!!!!, why is there dances, and by the way they suck as well, I would rather watch Bill Mury take a dump than watch this movie. I beg you, don't watch this movie, it will destroy you and destroy Ghostbusters. THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!!!!!. There is nothing good about this movie, nothing!. Why did they reboot Ghostbusters, the studio had the chance to do Ghostbusters 3, but no...they make a unfunny, goofy, crap, waste, garbage movie. I wish they didn't makes this movie, I rather watch X Men Origins Wolverine than is movie. I don't want anyone to watch this movie, it is the devil to Ghostbusters film, it suck so much that I sucks more than Terminator Salvation. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
" Poor women for being casted in this awful movie
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,1,"This movie is one of the worst comedy movies I have ever watched and I have watched a lot of movies. The producers and directors of this movies deserve to be criticised for insulting so many people as well as women.I tried to watch this movie with 4 family members, 2 fell asleep and 2 went, I was the only one left to watch the complete movie. The next day we just made fun of how bad it was.This movie will in some years be known as one of those movies that are so bad it was good.And I pray that if there will be made more remakes or sequels of movies that earlier has had a male cast but the second time around will have a female cast, that you please give them a good movie!I give this movie 1 of 10 stars"
" Ghostbusters or wallet buster
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,1,"I wanted to watch this movie, without the prejudice I had heard about, so I ignored all the negative comments and gave it the respect this franchise had built up from the original. Wow, where to start, well positively, I felt it started brightly, the haunted house theme, sat well with me, but then in came the main characters , I've never seen a film die so quickly, extremely unfunny script, acted by extremely unfunny actors!. Somebody, somewhere looked at this project and signed off at least $200 million, to make this!. Some reports state $500 million had to be made to make this film profitable , after all bills including marketing!. How they managed to get most of the original ghostbusters to have bit parts in this amazes me. It tries painfully hard to be slap stick, but in the efforts to be funny, it seems to have lost all communication with its audience. If it was meant to be a disaster movie then it achieves this, it's the only movie were I hoped the ghouls would win and kill off all the main characters !!. Just to prevent another film!. A big budget film comes with great responsibility, this one is as responsible as a one year old baby. Thisis without doubt one of the worst I have ever had to endure, to sit through to the end , to me , was a major accomplishment. What were the producers thinking!!.???"
" Laughed out loud-extended version
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,8,"I liked this movie and I enjoyed it enough to watch it several times, just like the original ghostbusters. I think the extended version that I watched first is better than the theatre cut, so watch that version if you can. I love the character Holzman. Just like the odd Lilly from Pitch Perfect, they both made me laugh out loud. Kevin's lines were funny as well, and it was great to see cameos from the originals. I am a big fan of films with kick ass female characters and I hope they bring these characters back for a sequel.I am always a fan of I'm surprised that so many people have it a 1 out of 10 as if there were no other numbers that can be used. A bit extreme. I have never rated any movie a 1 or a 10 because to me there are more shades than black and white."
" As a woman even I can see they force fed a script with women leads
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,2,"Felt rushed, little original plot, too many things crammed in from the first two. The ghosts felt extremely weak and underdeveloped/not inspired.It gets one star for having the name Ghostbusters and one star for the original cast's cameo and that is about it.Remakes and reboots are generally sad and this was even sadder. It just plain disappointed this girl. The supreme big ghost was a complete unimaginative joke compared to an actual spirit that is evil. The original ghostbusters need to come back, that is the only thing that can save this mess of a beginning to a new guaranteed series. The ghostbusters universe otherwise is much better without this unfunny nonsense."
" Not a great film but not deserving of all the hate
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,4,"For various reasons this film attracted a maelstrom of hatred, most of it undeserved hyperbole. To be sure, I don't think this is a great film but it's not terrible. The biggest challenge it faced was living up to the reputation of the original and unfortunately it missed that mark. Because the plot is so similar to the original (and to the second film for that matter) this film is really a remake and not a reboot so right off the bat it's set up to fail. Reboots have proved successful but remakes of GOOD movies are always a bad idea; the best you can hope for is to be as good as the original. Still, some aspects were enjoyable: Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig (actors with significant movie experience) had great chemistry and their interplay kept the movie going in the first half. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon, however, are basically comedy sketch actors and it shows. Jones does her usual thing adequately but McKinnon was given way too much latitude. I have a feeling that the cast was allowed to improvise and in some cases it turned out well such as McCarthy's reactions to Wiig's fawning over Chris Hemsworth. McKinnon was permitted to ham it up, though, and her antics were distracting if not outright annoying. This is a common trait among SNL performers for whom overdoing it is often the only way to stand out in a crowded cast. A decent director would have had her dial it way back. McKinnon is still an order of magnitude better than Hemsworth though. As the highest profile name in the cast, I think he was indulged to modify his character according to his own comedic sensibilities and the result is consistently lame. Again, a better director would have known how to manage his cast."
" Who you gonna call and recommend this movie to? Absolutely nobody!
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,5,"Ghostbusters 2016Why all the hate? Well, my opinion of the movie wasn't one to go along with the sexist drivel this film was receiving. There were many comments in protest to the female leads who do a fine job in this movie. Especially considering what they have to work with. Sadly not very much. My protest was more of a ""why?"" Why do we need a reboot? Surely seeing the original cast reunite would have been worth the ticket price alone? I am getting tired of seeing fond childhood memories of 80's,90's classics sullied just so Hollywood can milk a few more million dollars. Total Recall, Robocop, anyone? I remember as an eight year old boy going to see the original Ghostbusters and being both amazed and frightened by the movie magic on screen And that's what's missing here, magic! This 2016 version is not all bad but in comparison to the original it's just a little bland. Fine if you are too young to have been around in 1984. This update as you'd expect has CGI polish sprayed all over the screen but none of it seems to be buffed up. Colourful visuals never amaze or excite. There are no jump scares, no nail biters. Everything is a little cartoonish. Maybe it's because I'm not eight years old anymore? There's a good comedic turn from Chris Hemsworth but other than that I'm really struggling to write a review here. This film is instantly forgettable. Even the strategically placed cameos fail to make an impression. They seem to be spaced throughout the movie so we don't get up and leave. There's even one in the end credits. For me this was a throw away movie. It passed a few hours more pleasurably than say 'watching paint dry?' I subconsciously waited until the movie came on TV before watching it. Now I realise why."
" Stop giving this movie a hard time!
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,8,"People really need to stop giving this movie a hard time. I am a child of the 80's, and watched the originals the first time around. I thought this was fresh, funny and respectful of the first franchise. I hope they do a sequel. It's brave taking on such iconic cinema hits, not many get it right. Nothing is ever as good as the original, because back then, we were kids, so it was magical and new, so it's unfair to expect that excitement. I really enjoyed it for it's own merits and you do get lots of nods to the original movies. People need to stop going in hard on this. It's a fun movie with great actors. Stop taking things so serious and enjoy it."
" great reboot
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,9,"This was a great family comedy reboot. It did have many major cameos appearances from the original 80s cast. It also had a stupid pretty boy played by Chris Hemsworth, but anyone in their right minds would not take a job with ghost-busters. It does have some adult raunchy jokes, but its a Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig movie so you have to expect to see their humor. It is not as sexually orientated as the originals as it did not have a possessed Sigorney Weaver having a floating orgasm. Overall it is a great family movie that my kids laughed all the way through and they loved the cameos from Slimer and Stay Puff Marshmellow Man. Very Fun!!!!"
" You're better off watching the original Ghostbusters instead of this farce.
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,1,"How could someone green-light this movie from just the writing alone? I knew this was a horrible movie going in, and yet I still tried to watch it. All I could handle was the first 20 minutes before I shut it off and returned to watching the original Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters-2. You know what the biggest difference between the original movies and this horrible excuse for a movie? The first 20 minutes of the original two movies were fun, interesting, and not over-the-top with obscenities, sexism, or had any jokes that came close to talking about anything on the level of queefing in a ""family"" movie. In fact, this movie had a LOT of raunchiness that the original two movies never had. You have to be desperate to find any level of raunchiness in the original Ghostbusters movies. The closest thing that people could call ""raunchy"" was in ""Ghostbusters 2"" in the scene where Janine Melnitz begins hitting on Louis Tully. That whole segment was the most sexually explicit scene of either of the two movies, yet it was still tame in comparison to the references made inside the first 25 minutes of this schlock adaptation."
" Should have listened to all the negative reviews
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,5,"Ghostbusters is a remake involving ghost hunters in which the entire cast is replaced by women. Once strange reports about ghosts in New York show up, A bunch of Paranormal investigators team up to find out why this is happening. lets start with the good even though this movie offers a little bit of that. I was kinda enjoying the 3rd act because that's what i thought this movie was going to be. They brought a bunch of talented people in this movie and some of them were funny. But now for the bad. The movie was just boring. I wanted to see the cast busting ghosts but when really the movie focuses on them and their comedy. I was trying not to fall asleep the movie was so boring. Now this movie is not as terrible as you may think. But when you pay $10 to see a movie, you expect the movie to be entertaining, but however the movie did not do it's job to entertain me. And what sucks is you can't say this movie is bad, without being called a sexist pig. And i have nothing against the cast being women. So overall, Ghostbusters is a choppy, unfunny, and boring experience C- or 5/10."
" Sometimes the original shouldn't be touched!
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,5,"The new Ghostbusters isn't as awful as other films but it was definitely disappointing of it had zero charm, the effects were badly made to say the list and the comedy in it was poop-jokes that even the Jackass crew would find to immature.The main reason why I didn't review it sooner was to re watch it and let my personal thoughts shank in and not be affected by the war between those who said that it is a dis-grace to the memory of the original, the persons who said that the first-ones are misogynists and the usual trouble-makers who joint either side just to cause more chaos for their amusement. So not wanting to get tangled in to that mess I took my time and this is my personal point of view.Firstly the actresses in the film are quit good comedians when they have the proper material and here sadly it isn't the case. An other issue that I have is that almost all the male characters are total A-holes to our protagonists. OK I get to have some of them be like that ,but everyone(?) that is genuinely offensive to the other half of our specie. This when you think ,no matter the gender it is wrong to show in such as way our society.Secondary as previous mentioned the effects aren't even on par with the 1987 film, really you had tens of millions in your disposal and this is your best? As for the jokes are seldomly good and usually I felt that were written by people who lack any idea what is comedy. As for the little horror elements are OK at times and forgettable in the rest of the flick.Thirdly the theme song was awful. For real I have no clue why they choose that piece a garbage. It tries to be like the original ,but in the modern times. Here an idea WHY NOT use a theme which is made for you and you can use it!?!Over all it is times like that, when you think that Hollywood has run out of originality and you get nostalgia. To be honest after reaching a little I saw that after the first film most of the main members and directorial team didn't wanted to come back so can it be a surprise that a film which was never to be made was below our expectations"
" Man what a turd of a movie that was!
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,2,Having been a big fan of the original movie and watched the trailers for this one I was really looking forward to it but was massively disappointed: - They had the cast! - They had 2016 special effects capability! - They had $144M budget! - They had a great director! - They had cameos from most of the surviving original cast! - They had a trailer with some good gags! - They even had some good founding concepts!What happened to this movie?!?!?! How did that script happen?!?!?This movie had so much potential which has just been completely wasted.It didn't start off too badly despite the main characters just spouting long strings of physics related words that even in sci-fi should exist in the same sentence (It is like the director just said say random words and we will fix it in post - I suspect it was supposed to be funny - it wasn't). For the most part it felt like it was written in sections by people who only had a brief overview of what happened in the other sections.There were some funny bits mostly provided by Leslie Jones. But that didn't make up for the fact they pretty much gave up on any kind of humour half way through.The special effects just ramped up and got tackier through the movie. The effects themselves looked like those used in Batman & Robin (The 1997 version with Arnie and Clooney)!I suppose this is one way to kill off a franchise reboot. Maybe they will try again in another 10 years or so...
" This movie is just fine. Sure it has problems but not as many as people would like you to think.
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,7,I had little interest in this movie until the whole internet freaked out about the trailer. Was the trailer bad? Yes but it wasn't the worst thing in the world. This movie shouldn't have been a remake but I don't mind the whole cast being girls. I like most of the characters except Kristin Wig and Leslie Jones because they just act the same they do in everything and it's annoying at this point. Melissa McCartney was great though.The bad of this movie is the ghosts and the cameos. Quit referencing the first movie it takes everyone out of the movie and makes them want to see a better one and the ghosts looked awful except maybe like 3 of them.I thought the girls had good chemistry and the weapons looked awesome but a lot of the jokes fell flat for me and the villain wasn't good as well. I just think this movie was good or decent but I'm not a big ghostbusters fan so maybe the people who hated it noticed things more but I think it's a fine family picture if you're okay with a few crude jokes.
" This is a fun movie!
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,10,"OK. Listen. If you like movies like this, and you're not attached to some morbid nostalgia, then you'll love it!It's funny. The visuals are great! The action is fantastic.I'm not sure what all the naysayers really have a problem with.Watch it with your kids if they're a bit older. Everyone will laugh. I promise."
" Absolutely terrible...
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,1,I'll keep this as short as possible: Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time. Go help a proper cause doing something that enables other people and their talents than these ones... The director messed up thinking this was a good idea. Much like the rest of his movies. As is evident from his profile here on IMDb.
" Poor film but does actually work with an all female cast.
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,4,"This is not as bad as everyone makes out but is not that great a film. It does actually work with an all female cast. Unfortunately it appears they spent so much time congratulating themselves on making an all female film that they forget to make a decent film. Melissa McCarthy saves this film to the point that if she wasn't in it then despite being a Ghostbusters fan I probably wouldn't have finished watching it. She is really the only good thing in it. The acting is good and the cast do complement each other. Leslie Jones it feels like she was put in at the last minute and it would have been a slightly better film without her. Unfortunately though it is a poor film with a poorer script. If it had been an all men cast then there wouldn't have been a fuss and it would have barely registered any interest. There is a nod to the old films with all the ""old"" Ghostbusters, including a bust of Harold Ramis in one scene. Ignore the people saying it is terrible without watching it and give it a go. Just do not expect much."
" Pleasant enough, but below expectations
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,5,"I watched the original movies when I was younger and really enjoyed them, so I was looking forward to watching this, as I usually find the ladies in the film very funny.On the good side, the film production is excellent, it has great special effects and the film looks polished. I also loved seeing the cameos of the old original leading cast. The acting was good and believable taking into account the material the actors were given. I loved having a bimbo secretary man who is basically hot and dumb; that was one of the funniest things in the film, together with the closing credits dance.On the bad side, if you decide to use somebody else's shoes, you better have the same size! Well, the shoes were quite big for them! When the original Ghostbusters came out, the film was an instant hit because it was original, it was witty, and it had wow special effects for the time. This being a remake, the originality wasn't there and, therefore, the script was predictable. No problem with that if the viewer had been given funny and exciting dialogues and scenes. This is supposed to be a comedy, but no laughs came out from me; except from very few cases, I don't consider this a comedy, is more a light adventure film than anything else. While watching the film, I found myself uninterested, checking my watch a couple of times, and slightly bored. This could have been hilarious, but it was just OK."
" Didn't even crack a smile
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,1,"I waited until all the hype was gone before I watched it. I never bought into the political baloney so many of the haters had. The movie was not the gigantic third wave feminism celebration that some of the loonies claimed it was, but what it was was desperately unfunny. I love, LOVE a good female comedian and there are a couple in this movie so I can only attribute it to horrible writing and directing. Bottom line is this is supposed to be a comedy, and not only did I not laugh or even giggle, I couldn't even be bothered to crack a smile. I found the movie about as funny as Schindler's list, but without any of the emotional impact which made that a good movie. If you want to watch the movie, it's not going to fry your brain, the effects are passingly okay, but I sure as heck wouldn't pay any actual money for it."
" It's all relative ...
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,7,"Thankfully I watched this movie knowing about the terrible reviews and so adjusted my expectations downwards - normally I am a big fan of Paul Feig as a director and an actor, but I can see why the reviews have been so bad. For me? I would explain the extremely low star ratings on (a) people who loved the original film hoping to re-live some of that magic and (b) that the film really is a bit of a mess. Having said that, I watched it through fairly easily, enjoying the occasional moments of laugh-out-loud humour (not many, and more at the silliness than anything particularly witty) and the general abilities of the cast. As comedians I like the cast but the first 3/4 of the film seems like they are swimming though mud (slime?) humour-wise, but when the momentum of the story finally starts to come together the film began to be - dare I say - more than watchable! Chris Hemsworth really is a funny guy and I kinda had to convince myself to enjoy some of the more slapstick stuff near the end (spoiler alert!) with a possessed receptionist forcing the crowd to dance Thriller-style. I think the primary reason the film fails is in the moment-to-moment dialogue. It is like they went in guns blazing to film the whole thing with a barely finished script, and a lot of ad-lib seems to have been relied upon for the laughs, but too many weak moments and limp jokes made the first half of the film a bit tiresome. Having said that, the cameo appearances are worth a look, and by the time the movie was winding up and preparing itself for The Big Finish I found myself properly enjoying it. I hope Paul Feig gets his groove back in future and doesn't start filming any projects before the script is fully honed. Even though much of it is a mess, there is still value in it if you can stick around for the duration. For me is probably a 6.5 star film but definitely better than one star, and definitely a whole bunch better than most major motion pictures released in a year - let's face it, the truly 9 and 10 star films are not so common, and the 2 and 3 star films are like - 90% of cinema!"
" (Somehow) Worse than Ghostbusters 2
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,4,"Whoa. This film is really bad. Not even a type of bad where I can enjoy it as a bad film. It's just bad. Not fun, poorly acted, poorly written, bad sound, and bad effects. Don't watch this dog sh*t. It's cringe worthy and boring. It tries too hard to be better than the first, and it falls flat on its face."
" Separate journeys VS just playing stupid jokes on each other
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,1,"As fan of the original movies it's sad to see the extreme change of direction here. The humor in the original movies were heartfelt and funny, the effects were charming, and I think it even works today, in its way. The effects in this one is more expensive, has more details, but is much more comical, in a bad way. The comedy is about yelling, exaggerated hip hop slang, and fast-paced, waaaay too easy jokes. In the original movies, Ivan Reitman was the real nerd-scientist who outsmarted anyone in any room; Dan Aykroyd was the doomsday historian who really had some fun lines in his movie-fact-based monologues about evil; Bill Murray was a jerk, but he had a journey about improving himself, that made him likable; And Ernie Hudson started out as this ""I don't care about anything as long as I get paid""-guy. This diverse group found something together that created a friendship based on real-felt trust, and they became a good team to hunt ghosts and save people. There was a real journey there. I don't feel the journey on this new one, I really don't.Because... I want the old comedy, not this lightheaded piece of ""refurbished material"" (to use a non-angry term). The original movies were about Individuals having believable comedic and heartfelt separate journeys, while I feel this movie is all about characters playing stupid, fast-paced jokes on each other. All the time.. When there are some hints of emotions in this movie I don't believe in it..So much that I give it a 1. Normally the 1 is reserved, by me, for zero-budget independent movies with actors with incoherent dialogue delivering, and a photo that lacks the technical craft-ship to give us a believable understanding of the surroundings. This one is made by real Hollywood people, but you know what they say:You can't polish a ""refurbished material""!Mic drop"
" Doesn't deserve the horrible rep
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Honestly it wasn't THAT bad. I've sat through worse. I will say this: if it hadn't been for Kevin the receptionist, this movie would have been pretty much horrible. Kevin made it funny and worth watching. Because most people are pretty familiar with the original plot, I think the biggest issues with this movie is that there are no real surprises, except Kevin. Worth a watch when you have already seen everything else that looks interesting on Netflix or Amazon prime."
" Worst movie of all time
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"Should have given option of zero rating also. I was not comfortable giving even 1/10. This movie sets a new benchmark of height of bad movies. Generally i don't write reviews, but in this case i felt obligated to write one. What a shame brought on the good name of Ghostbusters."
" Call back
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Some people just know when and who to call. Some other people would argue that those people actually know nothing. And so this movie about Ghosthunters, who are also female in direct contrast to the original movies, where everyone was male, did divide the audience. Now a lot has been made about the gender of the leading characters and it shouldn't matter. If you like the movie and it's really silly humor, you won't mind anyway.And if you couldn't enjoy it, then it's a shame for you. The trailer should be an indicator though and if you thought it worked, than go ahead and give it a try. The women in this give it their best shot, Hemsworth is doing his best secretary spoof possible and has obviously a lot of fun all the time.We do have quite a few guest appearances, fans from the original should appreciate that."
" Crude humor and poor characters
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,2,"I really wanted to like this movie. I like the other work of the lead actors. The repeated use of crude, stupid humor killed the movie - the first time I watched it I turned it off after 40 minutes in disgust and annoyance. When I gave it the full chance, I wished that I had stopped at 40 again. The women characters were portrayed as unprofessional- unfamiliar with their tools and amateurish in their actions. Compare their behavior to the men in the original movie - those characters were eccentric and inexperienced, but deliberate and not constantly mugging in that ""aren't I so funny"" way. This could and should have been a much better movie."
" 21st Century Humour
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,10,"If you put the best of the 80s comedies - Tootsie, Ghostbusters, Porky's... - against the freshest comedies of today: Bridesmaids, The Heat, This is 40, How to Be Single, Trainwreck... you'll know that that was the 80s and we are certainly no longer in the 80s. Thank God.I do understand the negative reviews. White men holding on to the lost era of male-actor-dominated 80s comedies where women were at best objects of deep affection. No more. All of the ""comedies of today"" above have something in common: Women are the Protagonists.Contemporary scriptwriters and directors like Katie Dippold & Paul Feig - in Ghostbusters 2016 - create and capture the remarkable freshness of Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig to celebrate a new comedic era where women's perspectives have become much more interesting to explore than men's. And most men like it too. Until they become nostalgic of the 80s. Don't touch ""their"" 80s comedies.Let's celebrate the comedy times we live in just like Ghostbusters 2016 does. Thank you for this new era of comedy! Thank you Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon, Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, and the many other top comedian-actresses in film and TV: Amy Schumer, Ellen, Rebel Wilson, Maya Rudolph, etc. etc.In TV and movies, women are - at last - TRULY ALIVE!"
" Won't be busting any sides with laughter
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,4,"There has been so much said in both the lead up and aftermath of the release of Ghostbusters, Paul Feig's female orientated re-doing of the beloved 1980's comedy property, that it feels as though there's almost nothing else to be said about it.Regardless of all that has been said, both from the haters (who get mentions here), those on the fence and those that have found this reimagining to be the entertaining comedy rush they wanted, this 2016 version of a bunch of ghost hunting misfits patrolling New York city as a collection of nasty ghouls run amok is neither humorous enough, engaging enough or even imaginative enough to even be held up to the high flying original released in 1984 nor the rather so-so sequel from 1989.Falling into the recent traps of modern day big budgeted events, the biggest problem Ghostbusters encounters is creating a decent story (which isn't even worth talking about) and with the film neither being a direct sequel or a remake, Feig and his co-writer Katie Dippold have created a rather uninspiring plot line that throws our talented female cast into a world of green slime and celebrity cameos but forgets to engage us along for the ride.A majority of the films laughs come from either jokes made at the expense or remembrance of the old films or from Chris Hemsworth's dim-witted office clerk Kevin, while the cast who've all plied their trades in various comedy enterprises over the year struggle in what was likely a case of the studio holding back their rather bizarre antics in hope of keeping the film as PG as possible for the widest audience available.It's a shame the cast weren't given total free reign to take this material somewhere new and exciting as it's not enough to just change the demographic from male to female orientation and while it's refreshing to see Melissa McCarthy be dialled back a notch or two after a string of ADHD like performances, she fails to make a mark while Wiig and SNL's Kate McKinnon get short shrift leaving the films last big four member Leslie Jones to take up slack with her loud mouthed Patty Tolan taking home the teams major wins.At the end of the day it feels as though this repainted Ghostbusters was neither a film many wanted or called out for and failed to show any of the haters wrong with a film that is neither a win in the comedy stakes, the originality stakes or the entertainment stakes.Whilst perhaps not as bad as many feared, Ghostbusters biggest crime is a waste of a ready-made brand name in its creation of a film that is instantly forgettable. Something that was never the case when we first called the Ghostbusters all those years ago.2 cans of Pringles out of 5"
" Awful, absolutely awful!
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,1,"Against all reasoning I decided to watch the full movie remake. Where can I begin. First, Leslie Jones (while sometimes funny on SNL) should hang up her acting career and stick to stand-up. She was horrible! I thought I was watching a female Richard Pryor on steroids. Kate McKinnon must have gone to the same acting class as Leslie. The only female deserving of being on the movie at all was Melisa McCarthy because she at least can hold up the others in the cast.They should have cut the remainder of the movie 15 minutes in and replaced it with old Godzilla footage. Maybe have Melissa McCarthy stomping on toy trucks and cars."
" Visually nice, but too forced attempts at humor
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,4,Story wise the movie is pretty good and visually very nice however the point what just destroys the movie is the fact that Paul tried to make every character funny. So what we get in the end are very 2 dimensional characters along with tons of one-liners in an attempt to let them all be funny which he just failed. Aside for 3-4 decent parts of humor it just is an endless endeavour of running against a brick wall and just overflows the whole thing whats underneath and that is just a good movie.Seriously what the hell was Paul Feig thinking when trying to throw in so many one-liners and *kuch* funny situations *kuch* (yes it's sarcasm). We can see he watched the original ones but apparently he didn't grasp the concept why it was working.Really if the movie had maybe 25% of those so called funny situations/one-liners and those were done right the movie would have gone to a 7-8 easily. Now it's ends up as a horrible failed attempt and ruining what could have been something good.
" Underwhelming
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,2,"I was a fan but not a huge lover of the original Ghost Busters movie which I saw when I was very young. I remember I also liked the cartoon series but I did not like Ghost Busters 2. I jut say this so you know where I was coming from when I went to see this reboot of Ghost Busters with a female cast and so you know where I am coming from, in this review.I am a feminist and a female but that really has nothing to do with this review. On the surface I really like the idea of a film like this being remade with a female cast of strong female characters. I did not find the characters weak and actually like the actors involved (female and male as well) but I hated this film. I just didn't think it was funny at all, I found the plot stupid and the actors had very little to work with.I also thought the cameos were quite dull, especially Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray who can usually do no wrong in my eyes. I think they should not have been in this movie at all because they distracted from the film.It's a shame because I wish this movie was good so we could have good female role models in a hugely successful Hollywood film franchise, and so we could see more of this series. Sadly I doubt that will happen."
" Busting Ghosts (and balls) Bridesmaids-style!
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"An extremely enjoyable homage to the 80's classic which seamlessly blends old and new to provide an experience which defied all expectations (which were admittedly tarnished by an awareness of the vitriol aimed at this film before, during and after its release). Sure, not every gag lands as intended, but generally speaking the concoction of SNL alumni and current cast members have wicked chemistry, which is only further enhanced but the unexpected comedy chops of Chris Hemsworth as hapless secretary 'Kevin' (just one of many very welcome – and successful - attempts to comment upon cultural stereotyping and general ignorance which the film is so evidently aware of).Kate McKinnon is a particular treat, closely followed by a solid lead performance by Kristen Wiig; but the real cherry on top here is the film's own self-awareness and meta nature; in which director Paul Feig actively incorporates real-life hatred directed towards his (inexplicably) controversial reboot, into the fictional story to hilarious effect (""Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts"")."
" Spooktacularly bad.
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,2,"Three scientists (Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and Kate McKinnon) and a subway worker (Leslie Jones) form Ghostbusters, a team dedicated to ridding the world of unwanted spooks. The foursome have their work cut out for them when weirdo janitor Rowan North (Neil Casey) puts into motion his plan to unleash malevolent spirits on New York.I'm not a huge fan of the original Ghostbusters, so I wasn't at all outraged when they announced the remake/reboot, with—God forbid—a female cast. Despite the trailer not boding well, and terrible word of mouth on the film's release, I was willing to go in with an open mind. However, I'm sorry to say that the film is every bit the total (ghost)train wreck that I had heard it was, well deserving of all the hatred and scorn thrown its way.A terrible script loaded with extremely lame gags, four leads who share zero chemistry and who are not in the least bit funny (but very irritating), an extremely embarrassing supporting role for Chris Hemsworth (as dumb hunk receptionist Kevin), pointless cameos from stars of the original Ghostbusters (all of whom should have said 'No!'), and waayyyy too much CGI: Ghostbusters 2016 didn't have a ghost of a chance of succeeding."
" How does something like this get funded?
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,1,"I've read conflicting reviews about this film and decided to watch it to gain my own perspective. I have no option but to say I'm disappointed to a furious degree. This could have been an amazing reboot, but is the antithesis thereof. The female cast was a great idea, but in the first movies the guys came across as comedic, goofy at most, yet mildly serious. I don't understand why the ladies were painted a shade away from moronic cartoon characters? Honestly, there are young writers and filmmakers out there with real talent and amazing stories to tell that are dying to get their work taken seriously and yet this kind of rubbish gets approved and funded? Nothing about the cast or visuals bother me, it could have all worked but the script and direction is loutish at best. I don't even understand what age group this was aimed at as I don't feel it works for any. Everything in this film could have been better with better writing and better direction, I feel it was robbed of both. The amount of time wasted on pointless dialogue and cheesy banter nearly made me stop the film and watch something else. I'm not being nasty or spiteful here, I unapologetically call this a waste of time and money for the people who made it, were a part of it or watched it. The only positive of this film for me and I mean this kindly, is that it offered employment to those involved. This is possibly the worst film I've watched 2016 to present."
" Just forced myself to watch it, wish i had not bothered...
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,1,"I put off watching this for soooooo long not because of the female replacements, i think it would have worked fine switching the genders of the ghostbusters and the secretary, the problem is the awful Paul Feig and co-writers letting him turn this into another awful Paul Feig cr*pfest the likes of what he has written and directed before terrible, bland, childish humor, female orientated jokes (which is fine if i was being forced by my lady to watch a chick flick) but should be more broad spectrum and subtle jokes like the original, but you let a guy who does comical chick flicks to re-make a classic this is what gets pooped out. To sum up. Story lines not terrible but not good just OK. Humor bland unfunny. Writing terrible how this got accepted as a script for a remake of a classic is the worst crime this film made."
" Please make Melissa McCarthy stop acting
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,4,"I will never get why you have to remake a movie if it is not to make it better. It's been a long time since I saw the Ghostbusters from 1984 but I know for sure that I liked that one better. Why would you spend so much money to a movie that is already been made before and even better? I really don't get it. This remake is painful to watch. The only decent comedian was Leslie Jones. At least she was a bit funny. But Melissa McCarthy, she's a total nightmare to watch. Why people like her as a comedian is a mystery to me. Her humor level is at zero point zero and the most annoying thing about her is her extremely irritating voice. Kate McKinnon and Chris Hemsworth were also a nightmare to watch. The special effects would have been good for 1984 but not for 2016. I so wished I would have watched the first Ghostbusters again instead of this failure."
" Funny at times, but that was it.
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,2,"This was the perfect way to destroy a classic from the 80s. Even though it was a remake, I was expecting something way better than this film. I don't care about the fact that now the main characters, I'm totally fine with it, it can be taken as a fresh start. But, seriously, I felt like I was watching a chick flick... it looked like Bridemaids with the Ghostbusters title because of the repeated jokes (some were funny, but it got bored at times). And, about the male character, I don't recall the secretary of the original film to be THAT stupid. So, I guess is just the way it had always been with Hollywood and its remakes, to ruin the original idea and love the original even more, and thanking that there are still great directors with bright and fresh ideas.My advice, don't waste your time unless you are a big (HUGE) fan of Kristen Wiig."
" Hilarious Movie!
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie as it had a lot of great site gags, cameo appearances from many stars, and a very talented set of ladies for the main characters.The special effects were great, but the audio was a too loud for my ears. This is one thing that I greatly dislike from many modern movies - you can sometimes barely hear what the actors are saying, so you turn the volume up to hear them AND then get blasted with way-too-loud music or other sound effects - like a ghost yelling or someone screaming.But other than that one complaint, I loved the movie! Very funny, creative, and just different enough from the original that it was appealing in its own right.It was a worthy successor to the original comedy."
" thought it would be bad, was disappointed.
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,1,"I have to admit, I knew this movie would never come close to the original ghostbusters, but I thought it would be worth at least one laugh. It was not... There is no chemistry between the actors, all the men in the movie are either incredibly evil or dumb asses. Did not laugh once, am now even more tired of Hollywood reboots. Glad I did not pay to see this movie. for a movie with that big of a budget the special effects sure do stink, the first ghost you see looks like it a PlayStation 1 boss. Product placement is ridiculous with Pringle's cans and Starbucks references. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, I can't figure out who the target audience is for this movie. Probably no one."
" This movie made me hate women in its running time--and I'm a woman.
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,1,"I'm a female minority, and I found this movie offensive. I've never watched the original Ghostbusters, so I went into this thing blind and unaware save for huge advertisements floating around Taiwan and Japan during my trip overseas. Nothing in this film is funny. I watched this ""film"" with my family in the comfort of my home, loosened and bubbly by snacks and beverages and ready to see what the fuss about the box office flops was. My easygoing parents didn't even chuckle during the whole thing except when I threw out verbal sarcasm to point out how unfunny the script was. Everyone's delivery was terrible. The leading actors were cut and dry stereotypes of deadpan, goof, loud aggressor, and hyperactive lump. The one who ticked me off the most was what's-her-face (?), Jillian Holtzmann. (Had to dig for it.) She felt like she was there for no reason other than to remind the audience of how dumb and annoying women can be. If the director intended to give women a more powerful role, this character did the exact opposite for me. Eating chips while trying to perform a task to save your jeopardized life? Very funny. Dancing and acting goofy to impress the more serious character? Hilarious, am I right? Who does this in real life? No, seriously, who does this with any degree of common sense or self-control? The other character who ticked me off was Kevin because I couldn't imagine how anyone so inept and clueless in the world could function in society before landing a job with the main characters. Call me picky, but things like this really make me hate characters to an nth degree. He wasn't funny, he wasn't sharp or sarcastic, and his odd mash-up of tropes made me question his in-character I.Q. and sexuality. I don't know if this was just my copy of the movie, but there was odd letter-boxing around the film that was intentionally put there to create a 3D effect whenever goo shot out of the ghouls. And the occasional energy beam. The effects were dull, the characters all unlikable, the script poor, and the running time a struggle to get through. After the first few action scenes, my family unanimously voted to turn off the TV which almost never happens. Summing it up, I am embarrassed and ashamed. Women deserve better than this multi-million dollar piece of trash. The men in this film deserve better if only because they felt cast as knock-off props to sneer at. This film made me disgusted at women during the running time I sat through because it pointed out everything wrong with how they should be. They weren't empowering, they weren't funny, they weren't responsible, they weren't easy to relate to, they weren't remotely logical or smart outside their fictional field of study. They were unpleasant to listen to, unappealing to look at, and unsophisticated. This is trash. The characters (not the actors) are trash. My mind feels like trash for even having to think so negatively of my own gender, and while I can acknowledge that it's over-the-top and whiny, that is simply how I feel about this movie. Please don't watch this. Vacuum the house or something. Vacuum the house if this movie is ever playing in your residence. Maybe you'll catch a ghost in the carpet or something, I don't know."
" Really bad
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,1,"Look I don't have anything against fat women. I really don't. I even pick some fat chicks to do once in a while and tip. My sister-in-law is fat etc It is just that Melissa Maccarthy is no good and she goes out of her way to be gross. It's like 'I am gross and so I am going to play it up as if it is an act' No, it is because you are gross, sugar plum. Anyway her time has already come and gone and her no-talent act is dated. Forgetting her the film is not funny. I mean who else is not tired of the endless gags, commercials, strong females beating up men and making them look like losers in series on TV? This is just another film along those lines. Why pay to watch this humorless rip off reboot sequel? Just watch a stupid TV commercial where the dumb man is proved stupid by the bright woman. Women's liberation is not achieved by making men dumb... and if you think that then you are dumb. As for Hollywood: get an original idea. This is not porn where we can watch the same idea over and over again. Thank goodness feminism is not in Utah"
" lighten up
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"Saw this last night on cable TV thought it was mildly funny. Although I heard short news clips about it being vilified, especially for it's pro-feminism/anti-male slant, I think people need to lighten up. Sure, it was juvenile and a lot like an SNL skit, but there are 1000s of movies with dumb blonde bimbos and equally sexist stereotypical characters that don't get this heat. Is it silly, sure. Did they rely on the original, sure. Will it end civilization as we know it? No. Was it a great movie, probably not. My wife enjoyed it, it was a silly movie to watch after the kiddo was asleep and that is all a movie is for."
" If only the bad reviews were exaggerations...
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,1,"At first I was hoping this movie was just the victim of angry fanboys. But turns out this movie is worst then anything I could imagine. Not funny, annoying characters, simplistic script.... This movie has literally nothing going for it.McCarthy is acting the only way she can, let's face it, all her characters are the same. McKinnon is just so faded out, there is nothing coming thru, I am under the impression it was an attempt at character uniqueness. The only good acting is from Wiig and Woods and even those barely gets passing grade. Don't even get me started on Jones...Feig has proved he can only do one type of movie and after 2 of them, it was getting old, now it's just pathetic.Not to mention this movie is like an insult to the original. And it seems to try to make a poor attempt at promoting feminism, but it even fails at that."
" A Disgrace
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,1,"Ghostbusters (2016) is a disgrace to the originals. Disguised as a remake the movie shows an obvious political agenda: Men are stupid. Shown by idiotic male characters and ""woman power!"" you are thrown into the world of empowered woman and comedic ghosts. Destroying an incredible franchise only to deliver the ""women are awesome!"" spiel. They become so enthralled in their own narrative they forget they're supposed to be making a Ghostbusters film. Take your political agenda else where and leave classic movies be classic movies, without your tarnish. To ruin an incredible movie for such silly reasons should have never been allowed."
" As it should be!!
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,9,Why is everyone being so hard on this movie and on these ladies??? This movie is super cute and exactly what it should be!! It's ghostbusters everyone and its fantasy and it has four very talented and funny actresses!!!!! Seriously Melissa mcarthy is one of the funniest female comedian actor of all time and then you pair her up with Kristen .....EVEN BETTER AND FUNNIER!!!!!! They're both hilarious!!! Kristen WIig is a scientist and her and Melissa mcarthy wrote a book on paranormal stuff and they reunite and ghosts start popping up and they form a team and deal with it !! Of course the story is predictable but we know this because of the other ghostbusters movies !! But it's still funny and well written and deserves a chance for a light hearted comedy and the younger ones will also love it ! Honestly if you just wanna watch a funny silly light hearted movie with ghosts then I highly recommend this !
" Not totally 'Busted'
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,6,"The Ghostbusters all female reboot has taken some shots, I'll admit. Maybe some even deservedly so, but how many of those shots were taken after the people saw the movie? After they judged it on its own merit and not in comparison to the now classic original it's set to reboot? None, I'll bet, and that's a shame, because it really isn't all that bad.This movie works on a few levels, the first being that it's funny. Say what you will about it, but you can't deny the sheer comedy power that these ladies have and share. This reboot was, in my opinion at least, way funnier than its predecessors which, to me, came across as more scary than they meant to be. The female comedians make less obvious slap stick jokes and are funny because they each in turn poke subtle fun at their own remade version. Yes making this reboot the mere butt of the joke does come across as belittling their own skills as comedians and actors, but not so much that you cannot enjoy how funny the jokes are. ""Ain't no bitches gonna hunt no ghosts,"" was one of the funniest things I've heard all year.Another thing that worked for this movie was how persistent it was in not simply copying what came before. A few homages and cameos were thrown in to appease the woman hating purists out there, but all in all the script didn't rehash what we've already seen and let the Ghostbusting world take on new problems. I enjoyed a new Ghostbusters story-line so much that it kept my mind off of the fact that this was indeed an unnecessary remake.There were a few things, however, that didn't work for the film. The biggest problem it had was making this reboot an all female one without actually making the women, women. Each character could have easily been played by a man, or even a putty monster. There was nothing specific in this movie that made it mandatory for them to be women or that propelled feminism or women rights. It was a hugely wasted opportunity. You expect them to tackle these things with something that identifies them as women but instead they just make their GhostPacks pink. Oooh pink because they're girls. Give me a break...The original Ghostbusters worked so well because it was original. It worked because it came out in a time where campy, corny fun was all the rage. In this more cynical and jaded world a movie like this has no staying power. It was a great go at revamping a beloved franchise, but I can't help but think that under a different guise this movie would have done better. Dressing up this ghostly comedy as Ghostbusters didn't take, but if you called it anything else then it would have held its own. That being said, this movie was not bad. Not bad at all. Not the best movie ever, but not bad. 6/10"
" Shockingly unfunny
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,4,"Paul Feig's Ghostbusters re-boot is complete disappointment, since it fails to achieve the most important thing in a comedy: being funny. Virtually all attempts at jokes fall flat, which is the more disappointing as two of the leads - Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy - are well-proved comedy actresses. The whole movie literally only has three genuinely funny characters: the tour guide at the very beginning, who only has very few scenes, Kate McKinnon's Jillian Holtzmann, who is a fantastically unhinged mad scientist type of character, and Chris Hemsworth's Kevin. Unfortunately, neither of them gets enough screen time to make the movie actually enjoyable.It doesn't help that the movie has a lot of other flaws, from Paul Feig's apparent inability to direct good action scenes, the sloppy camera-work and editing (I haven't seen a multi-million dollar blockbuster with so many visible camera and audio equipment in a long time), the bland villain, to the really shoehorned in cameos by the cast of the original Ghostbusters (1984). At least the visual effects where decent.Better re-watch the original movie."
" sad just very sad
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,1,"I don't blame the actors. I don't blame the director, producer or writers.All the people that worked on this film and the theater I saw this at, not their fault. I blame whatever idiot that came up with the idea to make a reboot of a great movie and as always just by changing the sex or color of the actors and thought that would make it a good movie. Hollywood as a whole has lost it. No fresh ideas so take something that was good and change the sex or race and everything will be OK. But then be shocked beyond belief when everybody hates it. Call me sexist or racist, whatever! Im the customer and it was a piece of trash and from seeing the box office totals, im not the only one who thinks this. To Hollywood, get some new people to do this, the ones you have now are idiots"
" I love this film
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,2,"I love this film because I hate entertainment, I hate class, I hate attractive females, I hate fun, I hate originality, I hate ideas, I hate spending my money wisely, I hate being selective, I hate supporting vision, I hate good acting, I hate new things, I hate class, I hate studio not being enriched and supporting their shareholder values at the expense of the film watching public, I hate non-mainstream, I hate innovation and I certainly hate it when some people out there demand quality. People stop asking for quality. People stop demanding some kind of a quality control. People join me in going for bottom-of-the-barrel! Thanks PS: I am not hateful! I love unhygienic women farting. I love this 'Ghostbusters'"
" Representation Matters
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,10,"I'd like to start this with one important statement: Representation matters. I don't care if some of you dislike this review but I since I can, I'm gonna say what I want to. I hope I didn't offend anyone in this.I really don't understand why some people are whining about this film, before they even watch it. Especially those who said it's ruining the original – or worse, their childhood. By all means, I'm quite sure Paul Feig, Katie Dippold and the four ladies didn't mean it like that. Like Kate McKinnon, I was born the same year the first film came out. Thus when I was a kid, Ghostbusters is a very well- known brand name. There were people already cosplaying as Ghostbuster. The theme song, Ecto- 1, the firehouse replica, you name it and we, even though we're quite faraway in Southeast Asia, got 'em all.Basically, when you talk about films, there's this sense that every single time they reboot something we're like, ""Nothing beats the original."" I love films. I give every single one a chance. I probably did it too few times, but I have never been so bitter about reboot versions. They're people's hard work. If you don't like it then don't, but there's no need to be so rude about it. There's no need to attack people in it, especially when they are from particular gender, race, religion, etc. With that, I'd like to note the four leading ladies are talented. You must admit there's chemistry between Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and Leslie Jones. They work as a team, fit together like the original four guys. Don't tell me you did not see the way Kate steals every scene she's in. Holtzmann didn't have much to say but you can't take her eyes off of her and silly gestures she did. Don't tell me you did not see Kristen's emotion. She made Erin the most conflicting character, so complex you want to explore her more, want to see deeper. Don't tell me you did not see how Melissa is very passionate. We are basically feeling what Abby feels, to the point we'd like to yell with her. And please don't tell me you did not see the lightness Leslie brought. Patty is more than additional member, she's the beacon and the map and the voice of reasons.Overall, I'd like to say that despite your hate, there are people (like me) who love it. I'd like us all to get along and respect each other's opinion. It's okay to like it, it's quite fine to hate it. But we ladies would like to see ladies as leading heroes that doesn't have to be sexy or seducing. I don't know what you see but I see a plus size, a queer, an anxiety-ridden social awkward, and a woman of color kicking arse. I feel represented. There are so many little girls out there feel represented. This isn't some feminist agenda to make you all forget the original one just because there are men in it. It's simply important and I am sorry some of you don't feel that way.I'm sorry for writing such a long review. Thanks a lot, if you're reading this."
" I wanted to root for the ghosts
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,1,"I wanted to like this movie because, well, its Ghostbusters, and I adored the first two films. In addition I enjoyed Melissa McCarthy in Spy and Mike and Molly so I thought it might be a enjoyable tribute to the original movies, or at the very least a fun waste of time. I suppose I should have known better,I herd about the dislike of this film, but although i didn't disregard it, I didn't take it as gospel either. Then there was the whole sexism angle to some of the criticism of the film, which Sony milked in order to generate more of a buzz. However I don't believe that the gender of the characters mattered a whit. If the four leads had been men the movie would still be as abominable, because the film is creatively bankrupt.Leslie Jones's character is a wince-inducing stereotype of a black woman. Melissa McCarthy is obsessed with food,(soup plays a running, ah, ""joke"" in the film) I'm guessing because her character is overweight, Wiig and McKinnon were both very blah. Helmsworth's character is a complete dolt and the villain was utterly forgettable. The plot is atrocious, and the story dull. The films throws plentiful, though, quite frankly, not very good, special effects at the viewer in the hopes, I guess, that one forgets the banality of the film. In the original you got the feeling that the actors got along off-screen and the interaction between the leads had warmth. In this film the warmth seems lacking, and the movie suffers. One horrendous scene involves one of the ghost busting team eating Pringles while investigating a call. This scene was particularly grating to me. I thought at it was first because, certain sounds bother me. Thinking about it later, though it was the product-placement that hurt more, the dialogue about the chips was unnecessary and could have been scrubbed from the film. Gentle reader, I warn you, stay far away from this wretched mess."
" let me rate this:
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,2,"Original Ghostbusters: 8, revamped Ghostbusters: 2. I had high hopes for this movie because I loved Ghostbusters, thought it was so funny and this revamped female version was just terrible and not funny. The only funny one was the guy, Kevin, played by hottie Chris Hemsworth. These female characters just pale in comparison to Bill Murphy, Dan Akroyd, etc... The writing was just horrible. Instead of a giant marshmallow attacking New York, it is a giant hot air balloon. And worst of all was the bad guy, his ""evil plot"" made no sense. The possession of Sigourney Weaver and her ""dog"" Rick Moranis was so great in the original and this movie offered nothing in comparison.I can't believe this movie got financial backing.FINAL VERDICT: This ruins the real Ghostbusters, don't watch this trash."
" As bad as an Indian man's ascents
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,2,Saw this movie today with my lover after a nice brunch at a expensive bistro and it is so boring. There are so few ghosts in the whole film and we have a farting woman and unquestionable bad hygiene. The jokes are forced and the propaganda for dyke support is clear.Also the instruments were completely unimaginative. Could they not come up with some interesting instruments? If not why make this film since there are no interesting jokes or women or even ghosts?Yes we wasted time watching this but reading the reviews on this online websites tells me there won't be a sequel so at least they won't waste our time again but hey that was my Sunday I won't get back I am sure the feminists don't care right?
" Despite being entertained, I hoped for so much more.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,5,"Being a fan of the original I was both excited and nervous about seeing this film. The concept of the film was kept very close to the original with only minor differences which neither improved nor hindered the movie. The big question was always going to be the cast. The original cast shared a chemistry not often experienced in modern cinema so the decision to replace them with female leads was a clever move. Let's face it would be hard to redo the original actors dynamics so a reinvention was the sensible way to re-ignite this franchise generating less of an un-achievable comparison. The female leads do an excellent job. replicating a similar (but not as strong) bond. Unfortunately the writers fall short on substance, leaving the lead characters with substandard material to work with. it fails to capture the magic, comedy and charm of the original. all of which would have totally been achievable by all the females actors given a better material to work with. This wasn't a terrible movie by any standards. Just a little frustrating as with such a simple story Arc and talented Female cast it's hard to understand why this film just doesn't fully hit a high gear. it constantly leaves you wishing it was more, because you know it could have been. This movie is still able to entertain and the younger generation who would be unfamiliar with the original will no doubt love it. For me it just eliminates any excitement of a sequel."
" What!?!? This movie was actually great!
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"I'm going to keep this short & sweet. I really do not understand the abundance of negativity that this film received. Everybody has opinions & of course even some of the most treasured films have their naysayers but come on!! This movie doesn't have much wrong with it at all, in fact it nails most of it's necessary components & the comedy really works. There we're a few areas that didn't nail it for me but that is really picking at it. I am even surprised to be saying this but I honestly feel that it's a better film than the original Ghostbusters. If your hell bent on hanging onto it's predecessor so much so that you've made a decision before you've even watched it then this film wasn't for you in the 1st place! If you aren't sure about this one just watch it because it's definitely one of the recent comedies worth your time."
" Boring movie
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,2,"A few things here and there that were funny, but overall a poor remake of the original. Special effects were not bad, but this is about 90 minutes I will never get back.As man, I did not find the film offensive or a male bashing film. I just found the film boring. The first two at least kept my attention, this one did not. Glad I watched on a premium channel we have and did not pay $10 or so for a ticket. It just seems like they were reaching to click like the original four did. The plot was OK, but again it was just an attempt to remake the original with a few twists. It had potential, unfortunately it failed to recreate the fun the original movie had. The best part of this was when the final credits rolled."
" Good entertainment, decent reboot and superb comedians.
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,7,"I usually read almost everything that passes by in front of my eyes. And seriously, that is a lot to read. And the first thing I read about this film was the serious amount of crap being said about it. Which, you know, made me sad, not just for the tone of the *cough* reviews *cough* but also because I knew this movie is starred by some of the best comedians out there nowadays. And yes. Turns out they are women. Deal with it, trolls.This said, reboots are not my cup of tea. I'm tired of the lack of risk that Hollywood has shown for the last two decades. But you know, my father doesn't like technology either. He thinks he was doing OK without it before its tsunami happened,which doesn't mean it DID happen.So I entered the theater with this in mind. I tried to see Ghostbusters as if it was my first time, not giving the chance to the downers, nor even my melancholia, to spoil it for me. And it really worked. Despite a script, or should I say the edition of it, who appears to try to move forward at the speed of light it didn't disappoint me. McArthy, Wiig and McKinnon (whom is my favorite American comedian at the time) are great on their characters and you can find my beloved Leslie Jones in a role a bit less histrionic than usual. Fun cameos I won't spoil and many Easter eggs for us, the ones who actually did see the original film. Good entertainment, special effects top notch, a little overdone though, as any AAA film nowadays. I definitely recommend this films for +8 kids, families and nerds like me, for instance. My hope is that this experience can teach us not to believe everything that we read at the public grinder of things. Sorry for my typos. English is not my mother language."
" Loved it-hilarious!
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,8,"These four ladies are hilarious! You have to pay close attention to their dialogue in order to reap the benefits of their comedic skill. If you watch the film while on your phone or doing anything else that pulls your attention from the film, even for a moment, you will completely miss the clever banter. I think that is why some people may have given this film a bad review. There is no reason one would not enjoy this film, as long as you aren't picking apart the story and expecting it to be a masterpiece like Shakespeare. You don't go to a Ghostbusters film for great literary fulfillment. This film was designed to make you laugh and give you a moment of escape and lightheartedness. I believe one could find holes in almost every plot in films and television these days, so give yourself a break, relax and use this film to enjoy some quick wit and fun action. I loved the various nods to the original film as well. Some of the outtakes and extended scenes I have seen that were cut should have been incorporated in the film because these four ladies have incredible comedic chemistry. Maybe if it were edited a little differently, it may have drawn more good reviews. Oh and Chris Hemsworth was a hoot! Who would have thought ""Thor"" could have played such a humorous role!"
" terrible
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,2,"even for a parody it'd be terrible, but this was a p*** poor excuse for a reboot. like anchorman 2 bad. ironically, kate mckinnon was the worst - zero substance to the character. the only jokes are meta, about the ""ridiculousness"" of the previous ghostbusters movies. please don't make more. this is so thoroughly ruined. if the bad guy can control all the police, why wouldn't he just control the ghostbusters? why are the metal dudes so chill about the green the green pterodactyl? why was kate mckinnon so awful in this? does bill murray just straight up disappear without closure? gawd, why even make this if you could care less about it being good - they've literally been mulling it over for 20 years, and THIS is the best you could come up with? p*** poor."
" With that budget it could have been so great
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,3,"For the record I would like to say that I have nothing against women, in fact I married one. Now back to the movie, after watching the trailer I couldn't get myself to spend money on this movie, I waited patiently for an opportunity to rather Watch it on the small screen and I am not disappointed for the choice i made. The characters are not believable, the nonsensical, clichéd plot was disappointing. I only need one hand to count the number of times I laughed. The movie is far to looooong. Finally i was not sure if I should be offended by the subliminal messages, on race and male sex.( White women scientists, black woman not)"
" Do not call these 'Ghostbusters'.
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,2,"Paul Feig certainly has quite the resume. This writer/director/producer has recently made some of the funnier films, including 'Bridesmaids', 'The Heat', 'Spy', and let's not forget the hit TV series 'Freaks and Geeks'. Feig knows comedy and how to cast his roles perfectly. Each one of those films and a TV show are spot on hilarious with charm and heart. This same filmmaker has pretty much done the impossible, which is revamp the iconic 1980's film 'Ghostbusters'. Even before the first trailer for the movie debuted online, there was a sea of online people who trashed the film even before seeing one single frame of the film. It became a whole thing where sexism became one of the issues here.There is a line in the film where the new 'Ghostbusters' (Kristin Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones, Kate McKinnon) read an online comment about themselves that references the whole female 'Ghostbusters' debate the online community seems to be having. It's a mildly funny reaction to it all, but this topic seems to come up throughout the film and feels redundant. I hate to say it too, but these online haters of the film before the movie came out might have a smile on their face come opening weekend, because this new 'Ghostbusters' just isn't that good. I'm not saying that I agree with the many people online who were boycotting this movie from the start. I'm quite the opposite in fact. I was for this movie from its inception and announcement, as I love Paul Feig and the incredibly talented cast here. They work well as a team and are quite funny with each other.The unfortunate thing here, is that their chemistry starts and ends quickly with this 'Ghostbusters' storyline, which transfers to a mostly unfunny and jumbled mess of a film. What really makes this film not succeed is that it just moves from scene to scene with an unfunny piece of dialogue here and there and some form of physical comedy that we've seen many times before, but this time it's with a proton pack. There are no thrills or scares in the film either, other than a couple of places where the music crescendos loudly and it startles you. The encounters with the paranormal ghosts are mindless and unoriginal as well, leaving the magic and mystery of it all flat on the floor.Even the characters themselves aren't that distinguishable from each other with the exception of Kate McKinnon, who plays an over-the-top scientist with huge glasses and a ton of goofy faces. It's very cartoony in the worst way. The rest of the characters may have just been one mind in three different bodies, all of them relaying the same thoughts and actions. The relationships between these four women just seem awkward, which is strange because one of the main themes here is friendship, but again, it all falls flat or comes across as super cheesy. What worked so well with the silliness of the original films is that the chemistry between the four Ghostbusters were organic and natural, and seemed like you wanted to be a part of their lives.That is not the case here. Each person just seems to be an over-the-top cartoon version of themselves. Even the villain in this movie is lousy and plays more like a character from a Looney Toons episode than anything of substance. Then there is the fact that the film takes entirely too much time winking and paying homage to the original films with tons of cameos, locations, props, and other lines of dialogue, that it completely takes you out of the entire movie. At least Rick Moranis said, ""No"" to this movie. The visual effects too were a bore with each ghost looking exactly the same as the last one with no real emotion or thrills to them. It was as if the ghosts were unfinished in the editing room and they ran out of time. Then there is the music and the score of the movie, which is just sad and pitiful on all levels.The new Ghostbusters song is horrendous and the score is unpleasant with zero fun and amusement to it. This all being said, there are some decent things about the film, well at least someone tried to do some decent things here. There are several moments where you can see the blue prints of an awesome movie come to be, but with each time good moment, it quickly falls flat and leaves an unsavory taste in your mouth. I mean, Feig cast Chris Hemsworth in the film as the 'Ghostbusters' new secretary, where he plays someone that would never exist on this planet. Sure for the first couple of minutes, his gimmick is comical, but it quickly loses all steam and just becomes annoying. I love Hemsworth, and I'm sure he had fun in this role, but it adds nothing to the film or the franchise.There is the potential for a good movie hidden in here somewhere, but even the amazing cast here couldn't save it from itself. Again, there are cameos galore in the film and be sure to stay till after the credits roll, but I won't be calling these 'Ghostbusters' again any time soon.YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT!"
" Horrible movie, complete waste of time, just made me angry what they did to the Ghostbusters concept
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,1,"This is a really bad movie. It's so bad it goes beyond the concept of bad movies - you don't get any pleasure in watching this idiotic screenplay, hearing the idiotic dialogues and watching a great idea like the Ghostbusters desecrated and demolished.I watched till the end and seriously believe the producers and especially the writers should be banned from ever coming close to making movies. I am disgusted.What made me so angry? - sexism, stupid, primitive sexism, emanating from the dialogues - and let's make it straight - it's that stupid man sexism, just translated to be spoken by women. Just WTF? - a lot of pseudo-scientific non-sense spoken by the characters, not even pretending to make it realistic. You can obviously see, that the writers didn't care what they're creating. - making the ghostbusters into some stupid Bollywood-style action movie, were they're making absurd weapons and ""killing"" ghosts. The final scene is absolutely idiotic. - the winks to the original movies was the saddest part, this is a reboot, not a continued universe, so you see the original Ghostbusters in some absolutely stupid side-roles. Just why would you do that?"
" I am a woman and I am disgusted by this anti-feminine trash
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,2,"I was expecting something with more comedy and horror than Hillary flunkies. But of course what I get after a long hours is totally frustration of watching a lesbian, a fart lover and women who disrespect their men. It might be hip in New York City to cheat on your man and put him down but at my house we love life and god and will never buy into the corruption. I work for a telephone telecommunication company and I am hip to modern times and technology but don't tell me this is modernity.And the all new bad ghosts/same old bad ghosts wannabe whose name I don't even feel worthy of mentioning, is like a what? spoiled fat liberal who just smashes up everything around when he can't get what he wants... gosh... and this kind of character is a leader material? is a bad guy that people fear? *spit spit spit* Donald Trump save us from lamestream PC trash and the immigration that Hollywood want"
" I don't get the hate
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"I really don't understand why this film is hated so much. It's a comedy. It's only purpose to be funny and entertaining and it is. Yes, some jokes are over the top, but the whole film and the plot is over the top, so there's nothing wrong with that. I liked the original version, but honestly I like this one even more. The female leads were funny and every one of them has a different personality (yes, over the top personalities but still it's fine) I think people want to be more than it is: it's a comedy that sole purpose is to entertain and make you forget your daily problems for a few hours, and it definitely achieves that purpose."
" The most unfunny and boring film of 2015
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,2,"The '84 Ghostbusters is one of the funniest comedies ever put to screen. And d'you know why? Because it featured three of the funniest people of the time: Harold Ramis, Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd. It's a very important movie to me, and when I saw the trailer for the new movie... I didn't care. Everyone was losing their minds over it, but I just saw it as a completely disposable, unfunny comedy that people would forget about in three minutes. And you know what? I was exactly right.The fact that everyone was saying all the hate generated around the trailer was because there was ""women in it"" is absurd to me. It wasn't the people, it was the JOKES. They were all terribly boring and unfunny. And so was the film, almost every joke fell flat. The great thing about the original Ghostbusters is the great flow it has, in terms of the joke. All of the jokes seem set up and payed off. In this, there's not really a setup to the jokes, or even really a payoff, it's just Melissa McCarthy saying about soup and won tons. Here's the thing. Improvisation is NOT FUNNY. Every time Chris Hemsworth was on screen it was cringe inducing. The CG in the film is laughably bad. It's not a good sign when the effects in the original film which came out in 1984 look better. As for performances, pretty much everyone is bad except, surprisingly, Leslie Jones, considering she was the worst part of the trailer. The villain is laughably bad and the cameos are embarrassing to say the least. Bill Murray phoned it in so hard I was laughing.The humour in the film is as low-brow as it comes and none of the jokes were funny. And therein lies the problem: everyone in the film is trying to be funny. In the original, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis acted like real SCIENTISTS. Bill Murray was the comic relief. Here, all of them were trying to be the comic relief, and it doesn't work at all. And then at the end it turns into a typical, ""laser-in-the- sky"" type ending with terrible CG galore.Skip this one. Don't see it. If you don't like it, it's not because you're a racist or a misogynist. It's because you have good taste in movies."
" terrible

Whether my love for girls when I was at high school, marrying the old ball and chain, meeting chicks nowadays or visiting the spa for fun when there are no calls or for stags or whatever I love chicks so I don't want no one thinking I am not a straight healthy man in the era of real Trump men Now lets be honest though there isn't one chick in this film I would be interested in and I don't want my little princess to see this and feel she has to be like any of them. Gross, ugly, stuffing her mouth, farting and generally not polite to the man (who is a bumbling idiot)the chicks in this film is why Clintons lost. They are dangerous and anti-America. Hey Hollywood, farting woman is not my way of life. Get outta here."
" Go Back to Hell
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,1,"This is literally the worst movie I have ever seen and I hate myself for seeing it. The four female leads are all just empty shells each with one dominant characteristic - we have the fat one, the quiet nerdy one who tries to fit into a male dominated environment (and fails), the stereotypical black character and the obvious lesbian. The only male actor that has more than five minutes of screen time is Chris Hemsworth, whose character doesn't seem to have two brain cells to rub together, and therefore correctly represents (in the eyes of those sad individuals who stand behind this piece of s**t of a movie)the entire male population. Ironically, he still manages to steal every scene he's in because he's the only person even remotely entertaining. This movie is just bad and I would tell you to avoid it like the plague, but if you're anything like I am, all these bad reviews are probably just making you want to see it even more. Do so at your own peril."
" Suck it up, gatekeepers
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie was absolutely brilliant, action-packed with cracking jokes and the best cast imaginable. All four ladies did an excellent job and Chris Hemsworth was perfectly cast as well. If there are some misogynist gatekeepers out there who cannot stand girls kicking ghost butt, then, well, suck it up. This isn't a film for girls or a film for boys, those who are uncomfortable with this really need to go and take a gender studies class - the world doesn't revolve around your fragile male egos, you simply need to educate yourself and move on. It's a win-win, really, because if you can look past patriarchal tropes and structures, there's much more fun to be had, including films like this one."
" Perfectly good waste
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,2,"I have seen the old Ghost Busters movies, and sure, they don't add up to my top list among the greatest. They ain't flawless, if I say so. But they have something, something that makes you smile. I remember the first sceen in the basement of the library, when I watchted it as a kid. That scared me, even if it wasn't that scary. And now as a grownup, I can enjoy that moment and laugh. Because it has stood the test of times. It still works! I actually get a bit scared, even if I watched it so many times. And at the same time, I laugh, because it is so well executed.When they announced the new Ghost Busters movie, I got really excited. I like some of the actress, and I think Kristen Wiig is a diamond in the rough. She has a weird way of acting, but it suits her and makes for some great comedian moments. I made this ideas about what the movie would be about, how they would incoperate the old Ghost Busters into the new. Aw man, thay have so many good things going for them. Served on a silver platter! ... But that was in my head, my idea of what this movie COULD be.Then I watch it, and I cant believe how they managed to butcher the Ghost Busters franchise so bad.First of all, I do not have anything against the female leads. Like I said, one of them is on my top 10 favorite female actress. I blame the writers and directors!What was that first intro, and what is that font? ""Ghostbusters""... The music starts playing, it is that old song. ""If there something strange, in your.........."" MUTE Whait, what now? So they add a text and play the iconic song from the old movies. But only for a brief moment. Then it is cut, just like that. It feels like the director actually don't want to use that song, but still have to add it for the old fans that watched the old movies. ""Hey, give them like 5-10 seconds of the themesong, that will probably do...""And this is just the intro, but it sets the standard for the rest of the film.* Stiff acting, without any chemistry. * Weird cutting of the scenes. (lets repeat that scene 4 times, when the ghost gets hit by a train, in case they missed the first time) * Bad timing. * Sad CGI. (That skyscraper did not really look real to me)But through the movie, they have potetial for some great moments. But they actually don't seem to notice them. They just say: Skip it! And moves on to another scene. When the character Erin Gilbert talks about her childhood and her memories of the first encounter of a ghost. Why not actually use that to set the tone. Why didn't you start of the movie with that? I would have loved to actually get some background to at least one of the main characters.And again, I know it isn't the worst thing about this film. But how could you say that those CGI skyscrapers look real?The film just keeps on struggling on so many levels. From the stiff acting, weird one-liners, lack of feeling etc.But the worst thing by far is the story it self. From the writer to the director. They have not manged to create something that stands up to the old films. Not by far! This is not the best they could have done and it's sad to see that they wasted a perfectly good moment to shine!"
" Horrible movie
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,1,"Where can I start with this. After looking at some positive comments about the movie I decided to give it a watch. After watching it I am 100% sure that these comments were made by people that have no idea what a good movie is.Cinematography is uninspired and bland. Effects look like a PSX game. The whole movie has a made for TV vibe. Cameos were terrible.The villain was so bad with zero motivations.There is also zero character development in this. Writers should be fired. I can't find one positive thing to say, it's that bad.This isn't a sexist comment by the way, I watched this movie with the greatest mood and intentions and it just disappointed me and ruined my night."
" Hilarious Current Humor injected into a Classic Reboot
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Rebooting a classic is tough, die hards will give the original too much credence specially if its ingrained that men should lead it. If you are able to view this for the comedic performance in the goofy style of the cult classic then this reboot will crack you up. There are not funnier comedians out there that could embrace the goofiness of the original actors while managing ridiculous ghostly special effects. The bad guy could have been a bit weirder, but Zach (Veep) was the usual dude you love to hate. Could do without the super tacky ""flying"" hug toward the end. 7 thumbs up, laughed out loud several times as I do watching Kristen Wig, Leslie Jones and Kate Mckinnon on SNL. and McCarthy is just the best."
" The new ""Ghostbusters"" has its problems, but none of them are women
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,5,"The wait for a third ""Ghostbusters"" had been an agonizing journey of sound bites from original cast members and producers about who wasn't on board and when it would happen. No one expected an all- female reboot. Fans and audiences can complain all they want about this 2016 incarnation, but these women are responsible for the film's strengths, not its weaknesses.""Ghostbusters"" gets itself into the most trouble for the ways it clearly feels beholden to the original films. The script starts from scratch with the Ghostbusters universe yet packs itself full of iconic references to and actor cameos from the two '80s movies that it struggles to carve its own identity. You get the sense that studio pressure forced its way into ""The Heat"" writers Katie Dippold and Paul Feig's script, as if they had a checklist for the movie's easter eggs. Regardless, whoever it was that lobbied for all these unsubtle winks to the fans should've considered how miffed they'd be by a completely recast and rebooted ""Ghostbusters"" in the first place that no amount of breadcrumbs could sway their total favor. The story has to go out of its way to include Slimer and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, for example, and all they do is distract from the experience of the movie.Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones generate the core of that experience as the most original components of this blockbuster (alongside Chris Hemsworth's hilarious supporting role as the team's secretary). We've seen the Wiig- McCarthy dynamic for a good five years now, but whenever they get together with Feig in the director's chair, good things happen. Good awkward things. McCarthy's character is a little straighter and more boring than she ought to be, but Wiig shows why she does hilariously uncomfortable humor better than anyone out there, male or female.Yet no one will walk away from this ""Ghostbusters"" without remarking on the comedic genius of McKinnon, whose Holtzmann brings a much- needed playful energy to a movie that tends to fall into stretches of taking itself seriously or playing out in uninspired fashion, both from a comedy and an action/plot standpoint. She remarkably keeps the cast and the audience on their toes.Hemsworth as the legitimately stupid Ghostbusters secretary, Kevin, on the other hand, is the movie's best long-running gag. Hemsworth nails the blissful ignorance of his character to the point that even the dumber lines that he's fed come off as giddily funny. There's also the reverse gender-stereotyping component of the joke and the way it highlights sexist double standards by virtue of being a double standard. It wouldn't have worked had Kevin not been written as a whole other unthinkable level of stupid.The script also responds both cleverly and a little more overtly to the public outcry that took place when it was learned that the new Ghostbuster would be women. Characters Abby, Erin, Patty and Holtzmann are constantly trying to prove themselves and Dippold and Feig throw in some clever and extremely warranted jabs at these sexist detractors. Sometimes it gets too profuse (the villainous character, Neil Casey's Rowan, tends to throw around the word ""girls"" a lot), but given the times we live in, the real-life cultural context matters in this film.Yet even with the smart subtext and the way the comedy hits original and entertaining notes, the formulaic blockbuster structure and kitschy (by 2016 standards) special effects drag ""Ghostbusters"" down. The action sequences are run of the mill, predictable and most significantly, take time away from what the actors do best – make us laugh. The scenes that try to serve both humor and action don't make the movie funnier or more exciting, making it almost impossible to bridge the two components into the kind of seamless viewing experience that allows us to more easily forgive a film's faults.Add in the pointless cameos and references and there's too much slowing ""Ghostbusters"" down. It can never fully blossom into the unique reimagining it should have been. In the business of big- budget franchise movies, however, pleasing the fanbase is critical to the bottom line, even if it results in a lesser film. But if that's the case, wouldn't the version of the movie with a new all- male cast have been less risky? Instead we get the bold ""Ghostbusters"" that doesn't go bold enough; the one that won't please the most ardent of fans but does enough to keep them from taking out their pitchforks – and proton packs.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" Had the misfortune of watching this
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,1,"Had the misfortune of watching this nonsense. Why? I will never know? I had read reviews on it, I had listened to people who wasted money seeing this in the cinema. I still went ahead and took the plunge. The script is awful, non existent. OK they wanted an all female cast, so they managed to pick the 4 worst actresses they could find.The original Ghostbusters had a charm, the actors all ""clicked"" they all worked well. In this one the four females feel awkward, it feels false and put together, most of the gags ( if you can call them that) are so obvious that just leaves you feeling flat.If Hollywood are going to make movies and fill them with their twist and idea of political correctness, then at least make the film palatable. Having people sit through a political correctness movie and a dire script isn't any ones idea of a fun. The original was a good popcorn movie, about catching ghosts. No political statements, no hidden agenda, just a good old movie. This one, well I have no idea what it was trying to be? I wasted a couple hours of my life with this rubbish I wish I could get back.Hollywood should stop trying to make political statements in movies and go back to making movies people want to go and watch to enjoy."
" Not even Bill Murray can save this ghosts from purgatory
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,4,"OK, I know the original is far from perfect. But the characters were funny, it has that 80's charm and everything felt original, fresh. Had a sequel, more of the same but you can watch for entertainment and enjoy the original ingredients once more, without dying in the process.Many years later, as most of 80's revamps of cult movies We get this atrocious homage, in a world where Ghostbusters 1 and 2 never happened, despite everything is pretty much a copy of the first one but with four girls instead of four guys.Yeah, this people watched the movies that's based on at least, so the winks are everywhere for you to know this. They even managed to put Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Bill Murray somewhere, being this last a funny one appearance. You can also watch Andy García and some other famous actors, but if you have the curiosity just watch them in YouTube.The first part of the movie was just predictive, with no memorable characters or events. The second one was painful to watch and dull, they really try with everything They have, but doesn't get to an approved. Performances are just fine, but characters fail to be of any interest. Remarkable ghosts are the ones from the original... at least CGI's are flawless and Kristen Wiig is beautiful, some girls will also enjoy Chris Hemsworth's show, but this is sad.There's nothing more to say without spoil the reasons why the ghosts are everywhere and how they disappear. I can't think of any reason or value for this one, so if you read this... believe me. You can live without this."
" Good, despite all
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"I liked the movie, despite everything the Internet says. It's a good movie. In fact, I liked it better than the original, because there were some explanations that were missing in the first one: like evolution of the weapon, the part were we don't know what happen between them being unknown and how they became really popular. I really liked the fact that there were a lots of wink to the originals: like the marshmallow man, the original actors who did some cameo, etc. Also, the 3D was really good!I think that the movie deserve a chance, but you shouldn't compare it to the original if you really liked them."
" Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon are fantastic
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,5,This is an OK movie not good not bad The Leads of Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy are terrible but the fantastic performances of Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon all most save the film The story is OK the cameos are pointless and daft the CGI is fantastic The big lead balloon is Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy they are not funny and the back story of there charterers sucks also the hole i care what people think is a high school movie plot not right for this If you could get rid of the teenage girl plot and the two terrible actresses this one would be getting a seven the other actresses and there on screen intelligence and subtle little things are with the very good CGI rely worth watching oh and why a bad guy could we not have had a bad women ?
" I ain't afraid of no Movie... Well, Except Trainspotting!
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Oh Boy! After its box office slamming and all the controversy, I finally got around to seeing this film...And - Well, its actually OK!Not groundbreaking - But its OK!Its actually easier to deal with the BAD first.First, The Marketing was DIRE!Sony Pictures in my view wanted to stir up controversy to sell more tickets - Hence they said a New Ghost-busters was on the way and led fans to believe it was going to be a sequel before admitting it was a reboot...The effects, Oh dear god... Was this a Sony Pictures Release or an Early 1990's Nickelodeon TV show Pilot? The amount of SLIME you have to wonder... And the Visuals look like a bad Scooby Doo Movie, of which we have had too many already!And I HATE DESPERATE ATTEMPTS TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT!And NO! I am not talking about the Ghost Busters being Women... In fact, that was FINE! I will get to that more shortly as I talk about the Good...No, I am talking about some of the jokes which are very hit and miss, For instance, I would say Spoiler alert but this is shown in the damn trailers... Leslie Jones attempts a stage dive and is dropped to the floor and says something along the lines of 'I don't know if that's because I was black or a woman...' - WHAT THE HELL!?And Chris Hemsworth - Great Actor, and again - He does his part well... But its overwritten, overplayed, most of the time is NOT that funny, and worse still... SEXISIM MUCH!YEAH! I said it! SEXISIM!!! Hemsworth is there to be the Eye Candy, and its wilfully and deliberately displayed in the movie as a joke...If that was done a Male Dominated Movie - The Feminists would be hammering down the door to burn every copy of the movie - But if its a man being ogled by women - That's fine!NO ITS NOT PAUL FIEGE!!! You are either FOR OR AGAINST EQUALITY! YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE ROLES AND DECLARE IT AS PROGRESSIVE... THAT'S TOTAL IDIOCY!Paul Fiege declared that this movie was 'Progressive' - A Nice Hollywood Buzz word for being PC... My message to him would be Go and see Mel Brooks... He KNOWS how to do Progressive Comedy!!! Blazing Saddles did a better job than you and that was in the 1970's!And finally, THE SOUNDTRACK! OH DEAR GOD THE SOUNDTRACK! Talk about desperation... I HATE the Fall Out Boy Version of the Ghostbusters Theme, Sorry but I do.. But that's not the worst part...The worst part is if you BUY the soundtrack, you will have no less than 5 Versions of the SAME SONG! I kid you not, In fact I may have got too few... As well as Ray Parker Jr. Original Version, there are about 5 Cover versions!!!WHAT THE BLOODY HELL!? ARE YOU KIDDING US SONY???So, Onto the Good...Sorry fans of the Original, but the new film holds up when it comes to action. It has a good pace most of the time, Though there is some awful editing that leaves you scratching your head...The Ghostbusters, Kristen Wigg and Kate McKinnon are EXCELLENT! I am not a fan of Melissa McCarthy, but she too does well, but sadly it is Melissa McCarthy Playing herself more or less.Leslie Jones to me is a relative unknown, She is not that well known here in the UK. I think she did damn well with the script she was given - The only complaints lie with the Director and Writer... How can you have a so called 'Progressive Movie' then cast a Black Actress to behave in a typical Hollywood Stereotype of a Black Woman? That's NOT the fault of Leslie Jones, that's down to Paul Fiege who clearly likes buzzwords but does not know what they damn well mean.The film is very PG-13 indeed... Which is not actually bad for it... Kids will enjoy the bright colours and it does have some tense moments.After all the hate the film received, I am actually glad that I enjoyed it...Will it ever be as popular as the original? Nope... But is it worth seeing... Well, actually yes... Leave your fears at the door... Its not as bad as you may have been led to believe. But there will only ever be ONE True Ghostbusters Movie, its the 1984 Original..."
