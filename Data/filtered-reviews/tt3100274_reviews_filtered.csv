" Dark but a ten-star One
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,10,Witty plot and great acting of Brody and Strahovski!
" More a fairytale than a thriller...
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,5,It has it's moments but the whole plot comes across a bit silly and unrealistic... Anyway it's well photographed and the atmosphere is good and you can enjoy this if you don't put in question why she contacted him in the first place.
" Bleh
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,5,It was just ok. I will forgot it immediate after watching it.
" Manhattan Night captures Manhattan
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,10,"The film is actually filmed on location. It feels like New York City. Adrien Brody screws up with Yvonne Strahovski a blond who wants him to help solve her husband's murder. Campbell Scott plays the murdered husband in flashbacks. He photographs real life. The new owner of Brody's newspaper has had sex with Strahovski when she was married. There exists a tape of this encounter, and Brody must find it or get fired. Thugs beat him up and even hurt his child. Where is the tape? That is the jist of it.
Brody narrates some of the action. The problem is why did he go to Strahovski's apartment? Jennifer Beals is his beautiful, brilliant wife. She is a surgeon! Maybe Brody felt outclassed by his wife.
The sex scenes are of note, because they have conversations afterwards. The most enjoyable thing watching this film is the New York City feel that is captured."
" abit slow
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,6,This is a bit spoiled for me after seeing this star in Peaky Blinders with the worst gangster acting i have ever seen lol. Back to this film though. He was good in this but it was slow slow slow. Surprising ending so it really is worth the watch.
" Many Reviewers Have Missed the Mark
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,9,"This is a great movie. Good script, plenty of twists and turns. Good character development. I'm surprised that Yvonne Strahovski was not nominated for awards for her performance. She is strikingly beautiful and a gifted actor.Watch it ... you'll like it."
" Loved it...
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,9,"Well, very good, surprisingly good, engaging, almost hypnotic, excellent chemistry between Adrien and Yvonne (very beautiful), the plot is very tidy, extremely captivating and intelligent, lovely Porter's house, great performance by Campbell Scott, all very convincing and contagious... Loved it..."
" Erotic, interesting and different.
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,4,"I like this movie, it kept me captivated to keep watching. Adrian Brody's character gets caught up with this woman who wants him to help her investigate her rich, eccentric New York director, played by Campbell Scott, and you will see him like never before. If you like suspense noir, you'll like this very different film."
" Thought I had it figured out ...
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,8,"And, if you watch it, so might you think the same. But, I got the swerve.

I was thinking that Porter Wren (Brody) was being set up by the woman to be the victim of her husband's film project assignment (husband to film himself holding the hand off someone just as they die), but, I was wrong."
" People are messed up
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,9,"I've watched so much meaningless garbage for some time now in search of finding a really good intriguing original movie...and I have to say this one fit the bill. I was glued to the screen for the entire thing. I loved the dark grittiness of it and using New York as the backdrop. Adrien Brody is always captivating and Yvonne S. was surprisingly good. I've not seen her in much. Jennifer Beals was wasted and didn't seem to go with Adrien's character so the fact that they ended up separating was not a letdown for me. The affair he had didn't help but the marriage seemed to have been over for awhile. Adrien's character called himself an a*%h#le at the very end and he was right. He cheated unabashedly and didn't seem to care that deeply about his wife or kids from the getgo. He was all about his work and obviously didn't value his marriage vows. You get the sense that he's only with his wife to live off her salary as he doesn't make much being a reporter. His big glory moment in his career to date was actually a mistake so he is allowing people to believe something about him that is not true by accepting credit where it was not due. He's just not a good person in general. But AB really did well with this part. This just reiterated why winning an Oscar early on in his career was justified and not just a one off type of thing like some winners.The story (while messed up and convoluted) was original and I don't think the ending was something people could figure out or see from a mile away like some lame films.I loved the music. It fit the scenes perfectly and really puts you in that New York melancholy state of mind.I am usually a very harsh critic (read my other reviews for proof of that) and I rarely give many stars because most films are pointless and insulting to film viewer's intelligence but this one managed to be intriguing, original, well acted, well-directed, well-scored, thought provoking, unsettling and in a lot of ways realistic so that is why this is getting a 9 from me. I think the only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I was left a bit bothered by the ending. AB's character acts all sanctimonious when he leaves YS's character at the end yet he turns out to be just as twisted and messed up as she is because he spies on her at her new home. I think she did really care for him but mostly she was just looking for someone to truly care about her after her horrible childhood with her step-father. She felt safe with AB but he just hurt her in the end like everyone else. He had no right to judge her when he was certainly not above reproach himself. I don't like that it seemed to end with you wondering whether or not he's truly gonna be able to be done with her. Will he keep going back or will seeing her in her new situation be enough to satisfy his curiosity? I just don't like that the movie seems to be leading you to the conclusion that he might make the right choices in the end but instead it kind of leaves you thinking he's basically just given up his family and will be alone for the rest of his life and semi-miserable. Other than that I cannot think of one thing to critique about this film which says a lot because usually I struggle to find one thing good about the films I've seen.I highly recommend this if you are the type of person who is content with quiet slower movies that require some attention span."
" Good cast
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,7,"Honestly, this is not the freshest movie I've ever seen. I really have come to dislike the gumshoe (even though he's a reporter/columnist) film noir voice-over. Seems like a cop-out. And I thought it was a very slow-going film; it seemed to drag. With that out of way, the cast makes this worth it. Adrian Brody is always very good--very sympathetic. I must admit a big crush on Yvonne Strahovski since Dexter. I haven't seen her in much, though I was surprised looking at IMDb that she has made so many films. She has a great voice and interesting nasal accent--same accent in this as in Dexter, and, since she's Australian, I wonder if it's actually a faux US accent. Her character here is not dissimilar to the one she played in Dexter, somewhat quixotic and messed up but compelling. There are interesting twists that also held my attention. When all was said and done, though, I doubt it's be a film that I remember or watch again. As far as plot, I'll leave that to everyone else. I wouldn't go out of my way to see this, but it's an interesting watch on cable. You could do worse."
" Complicated
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,5,"A complicated,convoluted story with many twists and turns ultimately not very satisfying."
" Sax, sex and secrets
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,8,"I agree with the positive reviews with this one. It's a perfect piece of modern noir. It's not easy to come up with something fresh in this genre but ""Manhattan Night"" does it.No spoilers, but suffice to say it has some of the basic ingredients of the best noir thrillers, but served with a modern twist: a seen it all before newspaper reporter; a femme fatale who knows her power; and a rich tycoon with a secret.Adrien Brody's character, Porter Wren, is an old-style newspaper columnist in a blog and tweet dominated world. Brody brings world-weary insight to the role. However Yvonne Strahovski's cool, svelte Caroline Crowley has moves he doesn't see coming. Yvonne Strahovski is a stunning Australian actress, another one, and she gives Margot Robbie a run for her money with uninhibited screen sizzle.Steven Berkoff is the cultivated Hobbs, the manipulative publishing magnate. It's a role Sydney Greenstreet would have played back in the day. I couldn't help thinking Berkoff sounds uncannily like Thayer David if anyone remembers that actor from ""Nero Wolfe"" and ""The Eiger Sanction"" - both have gravitas in spades.""Manhattan Night"" feels a little like it wouldn't have been a surprise if a jewel-encrusted bird were at the bottom of the mystery; instead it's modern-day memory cards and CCTV that has everyone agitated.The film is saturated in mood. A lot of that is down to the score by Joel Douek. He does what Jerry Goldsmith did for ""Chinatown"" and what David Shire did for ""Farewell My Lovely"". Nothing says big, impartial city like a languid sax, but the music also expresses the intimate drama, the feeling that something sinister underpins the whole thing, and especially Porter Wren's betrayal of the things most dear to him.""Manhattan Night"" works on so many levels, for me it practically demands a second viewing."
" Dont listen to the horse story
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,8,"For some reason I forgot I had seen this a long time ago and watched it again, remembering parts. So it was fascinating enough to keep my interest and I wanted to solve the mystery as I remembered. I am not sure why the heroine asked Adrian Brody to solve the mystery of the death of her husband. I can really say that she surely had a rough life where men were concerned.
If you want to really be miserable, listen to the horse story . Otherwise, the rest of the movie is miserable and horrific enough."
" Intriging
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,9,"Brillant performance from Brody, never realized how beautiful a man he was till this movie, it's a movie I could watch over and over again. Great intrigue and mystery."
" Tell me the horse story!
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,8,"Manhattan Night is directed by Brian DeCubellis and DeCubellis adapts the screenplay from the novel Manhattan Nocturn written by Colin Harrison. It stars Adrien Brody, Yvonne Strahovski, Jennifer Beals, Campbell Scott, Linda Lavin and Steven Berkoff. Music is by Joel Douek and cinematography is by David Tumblety.A New York journalist finds himself in a web of intrigue and passion when a woman asks him to investigate the mysterious death of her film director husband.How wonderful to find that in this day and age there are still film makers willing to push film noir in its neo form up front and central. Of course the trick is knowing your staple requirements of what would be termed ""pure noir"", and of course noir in colour form is never going to be accepted in some quarters (understandably so). So approaching Manhattan Night to hopefully view a simple murder mystery thriller is likely to end in disappointment, for this beats a true noir heart and an understanding of that film making style and its narrative barbs should, hopefully, aid the viewing experience.Instantly we are served a classic era slice of noirvana as Brody's journalist Porter Wren starts narrating where he is at for story origin. Soon enough a sultry babe in the form of Strahovski's femme fatale enters the fray. Tumblety establishes that under wise direction we are in the realm of neo-noir photographic compliance, the pronounced primaries will continue to be a feature as the NYC locales bristling with beauty and lurking danger. All while Douek lays out a jazzy blues musical score that's knowingly complicit as a seamy character.DeCubellis has filled out his play with stock noir characters. The happily married man - a good father, giving in to temptation, the femme with a painful back story - which is compounded by a husband who is into psychotic love. The rich wealthy man damaged physically to the point of crushing his masculinity,
and his hired goons who like their work way too much. Into the mix is the murder mystery, incriminating video footage, some family peril and a whole lot of eroticism. Welcome to Noirville!It's not all dandy film making though. DeCubellis is guilty of letting Berkoff way overact in the first half of his character's story, but this is off set later in the film as Berkoff reins it in and gives us something more subtle and touching. The director/writer also gives us an ending that doesn't have the courage to really beat a black heart, which is annoying since the pic has been set up previously as such. Yet there's so much to admire here, so much so it would be nice to see DeCubellis stay in this zone and take Tumblety with him. 8/10"

" wow suprisingly great movie
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,10,"It showed up suddenly and when I saw Jennifer Beals, I decided to watch, later I saw sarah from chuck and I definitely decided to watch it. The story is not as same as other movies. It has something different."
" Porter Wren: ""An Endangered Species""
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,8,"It's fascinating, formulaic and full of intrigue but what's most seductive about this glossy thriller is its preoccupation with the peculiarities of its characters, its sense of style and the fact that it absolutely oozes atmosphere. Adhering to almost every main characteristic of classic film noir and unfolding at a very natural pace, it quickly develops a rather mesmeric quality that beautifully complements the strangeness of the developments and revelations that follow and ultimately propel ""Manhattan Night"" through to its surprising conclusion.New York City tabloid columnist Porter Wren (Adrien Brody) spends his days seeking out the kind of scandalous or human interest stories that he knows have the potential to boost his newspaper's circulation. Although he's remarkably successful at what he does, he can't help feeling depressed about the way in which the advent of the digital age has diminished the influence and respect that the printed media once enjoyed. He's also convinced that he's ""an endangered species"" and mostly finds it hard to conceal his natural pessimism about the way that things have developed.After his newspaper is taken over by the ruthless media mogul Sebastian Hobbs (Steven Berkoff), Porter is instructed to attend a reception to meet the new owner. This meeting turns out to be extremely brief and humiliating but what makes the evening far more memorable is his first meeting with the beautiful Caroline Crowley (Yvonne Strahovski). She turns out to be the widow of a world famous film director who died in mysterious circumstances and whose body was discovered buried in the rubble of a demolished building. As the following police investigation had failed to produce any answers, she asks Porter to investigate and successfully tempts him into an affair.Porter soon discovers that Simon Crowley (Campbell Scott) was a deeply eccentric character who was a searcher for the truth and often abusive in his relationship with Caroline. He was also an inveterate maker of short video recordings, each of which he kept as a single source of the truth and Caroline urges Porter to begin his investigation by looking for any clues that these videos might contain. Surprisingly, Sebastian Hobbs, who has become aware of Porter and Caroline's affair, discloses that he's being blackmailed to prevent the contents of a certain video card from being made public and demands that Porter recover the offending video without delay. Hobbs threatens to impoverish Porter and his wife if he doesn't comply and after being beaten up by a couple of Hobbs' thugs, Porter is convinced that these aren't empty threats. Porter doesn't want anything to jeopardize his family life and so follows a course that he hopes will head off the kind of damage that both Caroline and Hobbs could potentially do to his future happiness.Adrien Brody and Yvonne Strahovski are brilliantly cast as the archetypal haunted hero and femme fatale and Porter Wren's downbeat narration imbues the whole piece with the type of world-weary quality that's such an intrinsic and characteristic feature of film noir. ""Manhattan Night"" has numerous qualities that make it irresistible to film noir fans but also maybe doesn't possess the kind of originality or excitement that would enable it to be appreciated more strongly by a far wider audience."
" neo-noir wannabe
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,5,"Crime reporter Porter Wren (Adrien Brody) is married to doctor Lisa (Jennifer Beals) with two kids. He attends a party thrown by publishing tycoon Hobbs where he is enticed by Caroline Crowley (Yvonne Strahovski). Her dead filmmaker husband Simon (Campbell Scott) was found buried under some rubble. She recruits him into investigating his death while they have a fling. He gets pulled into a search for Simon's lost videos that he often takes secretly.This is trying to be a neo-noir. It has the murder mystery, the femme fatale, and the protagonist narration. It doesn't have all the stylistic markers. The shakey indie style camera moves clash with the needed clean cut neo-noir style. Normally, they play hard with shadows and crisp contrast. Brody is fine as the compromised antagonist. Strahovski has the beauty but her darkness lacks edge. There's not much to the plot. Obviously, the horse story should be much more profound. It should be hinted at every other moment. It should be connected more directly to the present day story. It may help to have her stepfather still involved. Almost everything needs a bit of an upgrade other than Brody."
" gritty, bizarre neo-noir
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,6,"Producer-director Brian DeCubellis had done some TV movies and short films before this bigger directorial effort, the neo-noir Manhattan Nights, from 2016. He certainly has talent.The film stars Adrien Brody as Porter Wren, a columnist for a New York newspaper. His wife (Jennifer Beals) is a surgeon, so they are able to have a darling house that is hidden down an alley in Manhattan - something like Patchin Place in the west village. When his newspaper is taken over by a Rupert Murdock type (Steven Berkoff), Porter reluctantly attends a party for him. There he meets the beautiful Caroline (Yvonne Strahovski) whose husband, well-known director Simon Crowley (Campbell Scott) was found dead, buried under the rubble of an imploded building, surrounded by pieces of jade. The two wind up having an affair.It seems Simon was a complete weirdo with an interesting hobby of recording ""honest moments"" on video cards. Caroline takes Porter to a safety deposit box with dozens of them. She invites him to watch them. But it turns out one of those honest moments is being used to blackmail someone, and the person being blackmailed wants it and begins to terrorize Porter to find it. This leads to Porter uncovering secrets about Simon, Caroline, and person being blackmailed, and learning something about himself.The film is based on an novel called Manhattan Nocturne. I suppose the name was changed because the filmmakers thought not enough people would know what a nocturne is. That's sad. The story is good but unsavory, and, frankly, so are the characters. And it has the usual female nudity.The acting is very good, particularly from Brody and Strahovski - she is gorgeous and reminds me of Sharon Stone when she was younger. Brody has had a so-so career since winning the Oscar. This was a good role for him. Linda Lavin has a cameo, and she's excellent.Overall I can't say I was crazy about ""Manhattan Night."" It was well done but unpleasant."
" I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected to
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,8,"I make no bones about the fact that Adrien Brody is one of my least favorite actors working today. I find his delivery boring and his expressions uninspiring. So the fact that I was able to enjoy 'Manhattan Night' as much I did in spite of him says a lot. There's a lot going in this film. There are love stories, crimes, drama, mysteries and even the odd dash of action sprinkled into the mix. And it's all blended together exquisitely.Yvonne Strahovski really impressed me with her performance. I had previously seen her in 'Dexter' and enjoyed her in that, but this was a step up again. Brody in the lead role, whilst I didn't love him, was certainly in better form than he usually is. There is some narration by his character and it reminded me of 'Sin City'. Very dark and gritty and admittedly well done.If you'd told me I would enjoy 'Manhattan Night' as much I did before going in I would have laughed at you. It took me very pleasantly by surprise though and I would recommend giving this one a chance."
" Who is watching who
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,5,"Manhattan Nocturne is a modern noir murder mystery starring Adrien Brody as a hard boiled crime reporter Wren Porter writing for a tabloid newspaper now under the new ownership of a thinly disguised Rupert Murdoch clone, Hobbs (Steven Berkoff.)Porter is hired by Caroline (Yvonne Strahovski) whose husband a film director called Crowley (Campbell Scott) was murdered and whose death remains unsolved.However Caroline really wants Porter to find out who is sending sex footage contained in a memory card to a wealthy tycoon.Porter becomes attracted to Caroline, the wealthy tycoon sends his goons to hurt Porter, the deceased husband was a sleazeball and Caroline herself had a troubled childhood.The film starts off in a clichéd manner, it is portentous, sluggish and really not hard boiled or sleazy enough.Strahovski is seductive but despite bearing some flesh never gets to Basic Instinct level erotic. Brody who also produced the film looks miscast and the turgid voice-over becomes grating. Scott as the manipulative husband who ends up tormenting Caroline also looks miscast as he just looks uncomfortable in that type of role.The film benefits from a strong second half as the plot gets more tightly wound but director Brian DeCubellis cannot elevate the source material."
" Hollywood can't make Brody into a Sam Spade
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,3,"""Manhattan Night"" has all the ingredients of the pulp fiction genre that began around 1930. It has a twist on the usual noir plot, in that the lead character isn't a detective. But, the newspaper columnist, Porter Wren (Adrien Brody), turns into a detective in his job. The setting, night and street scenes and camera work copy the successful techniques used in films from the stories of the early American detectives. Indeed, the writers for this film tried to emulate the styles of Dashiell Hammett (1894-1961), Raymond Chandler (1888-1959), and Mickey Spillane (1918-2006). The plot is quite bizarre and probably designed to be more in tune with the current culture's tastes for the noir. But the character deviation is the biggest difference. And, I think it's the biggest detriment of this film. Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe and Mike Hammer – the characters, respectively, of the earlier three novelists, were single private eyes. They were tough and hardened characters who could dish out a bruising as well as take one – usually more than one. They were hard-fisted, hard drinking, thinking macho men. By contrast, Adrien Brody is a happily married man. His wife is an MD and he has three children. His newspaper beat has him on the street mostly in the daytime, but occasionally at night. The filmmakers try to make Brody into the tough character of the model private eyes. He drinks and takes a bruising. Thankfully, Hollywood didn't have him dishing out a bruising. That would have been way too far-fetched. In spite of the script and the attempt to paint Brody as something of a tough guy, it just doesn't work. He is not a macho man. His persona is far too timid and mild – almost effeminate. And, as much as I like Brody in some other films, he just can't pull off this role to make it seem believable. The movie itself has some intrigue, but the bizarre aspects and overboard gratuitous sex and ongoing affair undercut the mystery attraction in the film. At the end, one has the impression that this was just another pulp fiction film. It was made glossier, for sure, but it's still a cheap, second-rate story and film Brody's Wren does get payback for his adultery, so there is a sense of fairness about the ending – certainly not empathy for his character. None of the cast gave memorable performances. Brody is a quite good actor who has the ability to make some quality movies. So it's sad to see him follow the road of so many other good actors after their peak years. Only he's going early into the realm of lesser quality films. I don't know how closely the movie follows the 1996 novel it is based on – ""Manhattan Nocturne"" by Colin Harrison. But this wannabe Sam Spade flick just seems phony and unbelievable."
" High-powered acting talent in this neo-noir offering
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,8,"Some high-powered acting talent in this neo-noir offering. I was unfamiliar with it, so I suppose it was not a financial success. Too bad, but it IS sort of a niche film, not necessarily one with mass appeal. Adrien Brody was typically excellent, as was Jennifer Beals in a small part. Yvonne Strahovski was great, even aside from from her eye-candy looks.There was at least one large coincidence that drove the ending. I realize that if no unusual things happen, then there is nothing to have a movie about, but even so it seems almost like cheating. But overall I liked this film a lot. Check it out."
" Adrien Brody's noir
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,6,"Brian DeCubellis's ""Manhattan Night"" is basically a modern-day film noir. Adrien Brody plays a tabloid journalist who meets a woman who wants him to investigate the death of her husband. The characters very much evoke a 1940s movie, with Brody as the homely detective and Yvonne Strahovski as the blonde who enters his life. An unusual side to this movie is that the detective has a family.I wouldn't call it any sort of great movie. I thought that the real strength was the exchanges between the main character and the other characters. But make no mistake about it, practically every scene adds a new twist (especially during the last twenty or so minutes of the movie). It's an OK movie, not a masterpiece. Good support comes from Jennifer Beals (in a role far removed from her most famous ones) and Campbell Scott (son of George C. Scott and Colleen Dewhurst)."
" Enjoyable drama mystery
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,7,"Film Noir like I like them. Even though there is not much action the movie is enjoyable to watch. It's all filmed at a slow pace, also with the calm narrating voice, but that's what this movie needs. It's a mystery drama that starts slow but once you're into the story it all gets better. The strange relationship between husband and wife Caroline and Simon Crowley played by Yvonne Strahovski and Campbell Scott is not the average day-to-day relationship and this is what makes the movie interesting. Add on that that Yvonne Strahovski is a candy for the eye. Adrien Brody plays like most of his roles, never flamboyant but always performing good. His character this time is also a very calm person that just tries to figure out some mysteries and solve some problems. But don't expect much action because there is hardly any, and the story doesn't really need action anyways. The story is strong enough for that. A good movie night assured."
" Avoid
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,1,"One of the most offensive movies of all time. I must admit I felt the same way about BLUE VELVET at first, but later came around. Not this time. Not this one. We will be lucky, VERY lucky, if writer/director Brian De Cubellis is never involved in making another movie.Everyone involved in this disaster,this monstrosity,should be beyond disgusted with themselves. Torture."
" Sleepless in Manhattan
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,6,"A different kind of love story. If you want to call this one a love story, because it's obviously more of mystery thriller with a bit of detective work thrown in, almost by accident - which is apt if you think about the breakout case and also the inciting incident. Brody may have been in the Pianist and other movies that can be described to have a higher quality, but he also did one with Argento when he lost his touch.So while this isn't really top notch, it does what it says on the cover. Is that enough for you to watch? Can you feel the temptation and the sparks between the blonde Femme Fatale (you may have seen her prominently in a TV show) and Brody's character? And should he listen to his heart or rather ... I mean Jennifer Beals is waiting at home for him. You can see certain things a mile away, but certain things may just be revealed as the movie flows along. Decent enough"
