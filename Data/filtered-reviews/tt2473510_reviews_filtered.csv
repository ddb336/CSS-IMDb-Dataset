" WHY WHY WHY
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,4,I'm a huge fan of this franchise and they could have done sooooo much better with this. I was really disappointed. 6 years later I'm still p*ssed off lol..
" Don't mind the bad reviews, it's good!!
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,9,What's with all the bad reviews?? This movie was really well done and a good horror movie. One of the best paranormal activity movies
" Where's The Ghost Dimension?
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,4,"So, this is the first Paranormal Activity film I've watched...which is ironic, because it is the final film of the series (as of writing this review)...and probably not ideal, as it acts a sequel to the fifth instalment: Paranormal Activity 5: The Marked Ones.It starts off well enough...as a found footage film within a found footage film, with a sort of timeloop aspect- with those on the found tapes having foresight into the present, which is currently being taped.In it, it seems like some sort of presence is haunting the home of a young family- and affecting their daughter, who claims she has a new invisible friend named Toby.Toby encourages her to bury her Mom's rosary, burn bibles and other fun stuff, like that.But her Dad is starting to catch on to what is happening, with help from an old customized camera and bank of tapes he finds in the basement.The tapes portray a couple of young girls- that have foresight into the present- who are being groomed into some sort of weird cult, based around this Toby character.The man elicits a local Priest, to help them formulate a plan to catch this Toby entity.But it fails, and what follows is an absolutely ridiculous crapshoot, whose only value is a couple of cheap scares.To be honest, I'm not even sure why this movie is subtitled ""Ghost Dimension"".It's almost as if they just threw any old name up there for marketing purposes.Because it doesn't really make sense in the context of the film.Something relating to the occult or antichrist would have been much more appropriate, you'd think.Cause there isn't really a ""Ghost Dimension"" in the film.The inclusion of that whole Santa scene was completely and utterly confusing as well...almost as if they included it, simply to sell the film as a Christmas horror film.Plus, it is heavily reliant upon CGI.When all is said and done, this is a very simple film that had some potential that was squandered by the ending.You could probably bust out a bazillion of these a year if you had access to a bunch of empty houses and got efficient at it.But the mindless ending just ruined it for me, personally.4.5 out of 10."
" Paranormal Activity meets Venom
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,1,"This is the only one in the franchise where you can actually see the paranormal activity, and that was its biggest mistake, it's much more effective when it's left up to the imagination. This one just has too much badly produced CGI.There were moments where I thought the demon was Venom, the big oily blob shares a very close resemblance to Stan Lee's comic book character, it genuinely felt like a crossover at times.But besides the bad CGI, the story just kind of cherry picks pieces from the 3rd film and tries to link it to this one, but it was lazily done and doesn't make much sense. It's full of cheap jump scares (that's when you know a horror is struggling, when it has to rely on jump scares to get you), and there are so many in this one that it actually becomes irritating.Think this one has to get the trophy for the worst one in the franchise, number 4 is a close contender but this one edges it with that awful CGI, at least the 4th stuck to the original format."
" This one is complicated
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,1,"How do i describe this piece of art.
I'd rather compare it to a summer fart.
The ghosts are all real,
the blurays a steal,
This one didn't come with a chart.More I could say on this piece,
Its rated to old for my niece,
If the namings was better,
my seat would by wetter,
And thus I let out a sheesh.Looking forward to the 7th?;)"
" Brilliant
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely brilliant , brought it back to the 1st movie scares & easy to follow, once again still has you jumping out of your skin! My personal favourite of all the movies. Must see"
" Disappointing
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,4,"Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension: Disappointing, a few shocks but the story-line was under-developed. Kids on old VHS tapes could see what was happening in the future (present). A Witches Coven was involved, if this theme had been expanded then it might have resulted in a better film. To make things worse the 3D wasn't working properly when I saw it. 4/10"
" It was bad but it scared me a few times
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,3,The film it's self was actually awful but it scared me a few times. I'll tell you what it wasn't the best but it was definitely better then paranormal activity 2. That film was dreadful and you can't really get worse then that.
" Not good
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,3,This movie is better than 4 but definitely worse than 1 to 3. I just didn't like this one a lot. Some nice kills but the story and character were just weak
" wow lol wow
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,2,"The worst part about this movie is that it was NOT SCARY. at all. like not even one bit. not even the lame jump scares. most of them were sooooo predictable and soooooo cheap. made me roll my eyes multiple times.the dialogue is bad, the plot is absurdly dumb, and i CANNOT believe how stupid the character decisions are. i almost had to stop the movie at one point because i couldn't believe it. like, you can't expect your audience to be this stupid and not notice.just to be clear, i went into this movie with an open mind, and i wasn't immediately turned off by some of the creative decisions that differ from previous movies in the series. but it was done SO poorly in basically every way. also, so many things are introduced and IMMEDIATELY forgotten. like, why was that in the movie? what purpose did it serve? does it connect with anything else in the movie???? noafter watching this entire series, part 4 and the ghost dimension don't exist. the rest are awesome except for 2 which was okay. (1 viewing, 4/28/2020)"
" awful movie.
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,1,This is a terrible movie. How did this get a 4.6. It just awful. It his badly written. It also badly acted. It is not scary it is just people who can not act running around it the dark screaming
" Pretty decent.
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,4,"This is another film from the Paranormal Activity franchise, but I confess I didn't find anything great. The story is very imaginative and creates a forced connection between an apparently normal family and the family of Katie and Kristi, the two main characters in the initial films, and the thread of the whole story. And I say forced because the connection created never seems credible or natural.It all starts with the discovery of a strange video camera and a collection of tapes. The family quickly realizes that it is a different camera, that it sees things that cannot be seen with the naked eye, and that they can be entities from the other world. At the same time, his daughter's behavior is changing and everything seems to undergo a sudden escalation, in which the supernatural becomes too obvious to be invisible.The cast does what they can to do well, and the result of all that effort is collectively positive. I would especially highlight the good work of Ivy George, despite her young age, and Brit Shaw. The scares are predictable, barely endemic in all the films of the franchise, but there are far fewer moments than what happened. It is the first film to make a serious bet on CGI, and it bears good fruit but it also steals, a little, the natural and genuine appearance of the film. The post production work has, in my view, some assembly flaws, with scenes that don't connect very well with each other and seem out of place.In short, it is a decent film that does not disappoint most fans, but it does not seem to me to contribute to attracting new audiences."
" Oh dear!
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,3,"A promising enough idea, and starts out reasonably well. Unfortunately descends into unintended comedy and several laugh out loud moments towards the end. Least said about some of the CGI the better. Usual excorcism *yawn* done too repetitive.The ghost/demon (past caring to know what) was about as frightening as a limp lettuce. Where many of these supernatural films go wrong is actually having to show the supernatural beings. Far better (and scarier) to be more subtle and leave it to the viewers imagination, something the original version if The Haunting did to great effect.Found footage is getting too over used a format now, and wobbly camera work does nothing but detract from the story.Worth watching only for the unintended comedy aspect."
" A demon named Tobi
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,5,"A family become subjected to terrifying paranormal activity in their rather plush Californian home just before Xmas.
Apart from the first movie I am certainly not a fan of this franchise, this sixth instalment is one of the best sequels, but that is hardly a recommendation. One problem is that while they lay on the ""scares"" thick and fast the fact is that this just isn't scary. It has been seen and done so many times before, as has the irritating hand held, found footage camera style. I only watched this in 2D, perhaps in its 3D it would have been better. The acting is OK, the baby sitter (played by Olivia Taylor Dudley) was hot, and the little girl, who is the demon's target (Poltergeist, etc etc) shares my birthday, June 6th. Certainly watchable but I for one don't care if this is the last in the series."
" Unnecessary and just bad
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,2,"The charms and low budget ingenuities that made the first couple of paranormal activity movies so interesting are gone in this unnecessary sequel. Trying to spot moving objects in a slowly building scene and anticipating what an oscillating fan was going to reveal were some of the genius things the first couple of Paranormal Activities did so well. The fear of what we can't see is always more terrifying. In place of that in this movie we have CGI effects, possessed child tropes, and bad acting.Also, part of the allure of the first Paranormal Activity movies were having non-actors play the parts of regular people. In this sequel we have actors that are familiar from other TV shows who are acting from a script that seems to be from another horror movie. The ""found-footage"" scenes don't have the feel of real time events as they did in the first movie.The sequels went off the rails around the third movie and seem to be turned out to make a quick Buck around Halloween and this movie is no different."
" Stop we are done
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,3,Please stop making these movies. I guess I could just stop watching them but the trailers are just so good. Also you do not need to tie in older versions of your other bad paranormal...
" Is the End of the Beginning?
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,2,"Seeing the end of this movie, when Toby becomes real and in human form, is this now the start of something bad or is it the end of the franchise? This seemed even less scary than the previous movies. Have the Midwives achieved what they wanted, or what? Kind of disappointed how this whole series ended..."
" A New Take
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,7,"I know this film was hated and I can see why. It deviated from what the original films did and went into its own direction, but I personally think that was a good thing. I won't go spoiling the movie or say too much except this film is creepy on many levels. I will say that it does show us a lot more than it should have, I do like the term less is good, but what they do show is scary and keeps you wanting more.There's not much else I can say that I haven't already said on my reviews for the previous films. This one has a lot more special effects, new characters and an interesting new direction that you're either gonna like or hate. I personally really enjoyed this film. The first time I watched it I gave it a 4, but after rewatching it years later I enjoyed it way more than I did before. Not sure if that's because I originally watched the theatrical version and having just now finished the extended edition. Regardless I enjoyed this film and will be exploring it again sometime in the future."
" God awful
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,2,"I am a big fan of PA films including 1, 2, 3 and The Marked Ones but this one and the one before it (Number 4 I think it is) are awful.....this one is the worst.....avoid"
" Horrible. Absolutely horrible.
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,1,"Of all the Paranormal Activity movies I've seen, this one takes the cake of being the absolute worse in the series. The CGI was awful, acting wasn't all that great, the jump scares were predictable and the storyline was crap. The only thing that made this movie good was the wife and blonde haired woman were attractive. Other than that, terrible movie from start to finish. Seeing the demon take on a human form didn't make it any more scarier. In fact, it made it stupid. Don't waste your time with this movie. They took something great with the first movie and turned into a complete joke."
" Finally
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,4,"The last of the found footage paranormal activity movies is a conclusion? Obviously if something makes money you have to have a sequel. When the first movie was a hit 2 and 3 are prequels because you have to actually have a story. If you want to watch them in order you have to watch 3,2,1,4 and 6 because 5 is a spinoff. The reason this movie is in 3D is that the new family finds an advanced VHS camera that can record ghosts and has night vision. Let that sink in. The movie thoroughly explains why the ghost are there and who sent them. Believe it or not there's a time travel element. Let that sink in. Mostly it's just just jump scares and why are you filming this instead of running away. At one point an angel ornament falls off a Christmas tree and it sounds like a twenty five pound bag of cement falling off a three story building. If it was a red solo cup it probably would have sounded like a dump truck falling from the empire state building. Every jump scare is predictable and hilarious. Actually seeing the ghost (that looks like venom from spiderman) is a good and bad thing because when something happens, nothing actually happens. The ending reminds me of the Blair which project and it's just as bad. The first movie revived my intrest in found footage format but by the second movie I was completely over it again. The 3D is good enough to keep my attention and as much as I was bored I wouldn't mind seeing it with friends and Jägerbomb's."
" Watchable at Best
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,6,"Many people consider this film to be the worst in the series. Me, personally, Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension was an improvement over the last two dreadful films, and while it does have flaws, I can safely say that this film was watchable and tolerable at best.The film takes place in 2013, and is about a family, that consists of a father named Ryan, a mother named Emily, and their 7 year old daughter, Leila. Ryan finds a camera in a storage box that can capture strange elements that are invisible. He also finds the tapes that show the footage from 1988 of young Katie & Kristi, and he finds that these tapes have some sort of connection to him and his house since he actually lives where Katie & Kristi used to live in 1988.Later on, Leila is having a strange behavior and talking to an imaginary friend, named Tobi. Ryan decides to use this special camera and some others to capture what goes on at night and tries to seek a way to end this nightmare.The film improved over the last two because it had much better characters, better acting, and didn't have such ridiculous and stupid moments. It did also feel scary in some (not all) scenes.There were only two problems that hurt the film. I really like the idea of how you can see the entity, but the effects for it did not look good whatsoever. It just look liked cheap CGI and could of looked so much better.The other problem was the story. It was cool that it took place around Christmas time and the house the film took place in seemed very interesting. However, we have the whole concept of a demon terrorizing a family yet again. There wasn't really a twist on it either, so it was just a rehash of the second film's story.I also felt like it was a mediocre way to end the series. We never got to see what happened to Katie (last time she was seen was the 4th film) and it felt more or less a sequel to the third film since the beginning takes places right after the ending to the 3rd film.So these problems can hurt the film, but again, with the improved acting, the characters being more likable and having better personalities, and the moments being more scary than frivolous, it helps make the film watchable, thus I rate the film 6 out of 10 stars.Bottom line, Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimesion wasn't bad like people made it out to be, but could of used some adjustments here and there."
" Santa?
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,8,"Ever think Santa haunts your attic? If you love the long string of handheld 3AM challenge Youtube videos watch this Xmas chiller. Now, if everything goes after the plan there migth be another PA next Halloween."
" I'm watching it right now. I've never been more miserable.
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,1,"Can it please just be over already?! This movie is trash. The story line is almost as bad as the acting. It's like they tried to go crazy on the budget and it still wasn't enough... I wish i could rate it lower than 1 star.i'm going to finish it though to see if it can redeem itself with the ending. I might even change the star rating... let me put my phone down and i'll finish this review when it's over.it's over, it was still trash."
" Was another good plot, not so scary, need more PA movies
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,8,"Was a good film i always watch a film at least 2 times before rating so i have a good understanding of what the director wants us to see this was, Good story another explanation of past films not much jump scares not scary interesting to watch really hope to see another film soon its been phew years since last one i think their taking their time to make a good film take it to another level 😁😁😁"
" Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,3,"The original film was a fantastic film and brought new life to the ""found footage"" scary movie, but the four sequels that have followed it have been either average or terrible, I read this sixth entry was the supposed final instalment, I certainly hoped this is the case. Basically in Santa Rosa, California, Ryan Fleege (Chris J. Murray), his wife Emily (Brit Shaw), and their six-year-old daughter Leila (Ivy George) have recently moved in and are about to celebrate Christmas , when Ryan's brother Mike (Dan Gill) moves in after breaking up with his girlfriend. Looking around, Ryan finds a box full of old video tapes, dating from 1988 to 1992. The tapes show younger Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) and Katie (Katie Featherston) with their mother and her boyfriend Dennis in 1988, while in 1992 it shows Leila's grandmother Lois (Hallie Foote) practicing supernatural abilities. Ryan notices strange things going on in the house and decides to set up cameras around the house to capture any unusual or paranormal activity. Soon enough, night by night, the recorded footage does feature disturbing images, including a dark demonic apparition appearing on the ceiling and making its way around to the daughter's bedroom. It is revealed that the house the family have moved into was built on the same site Katie and Kristi used to live in before it burned down, and the original house was built by a cult called The Midwives. Leila gradually becomes less talkative and Ryan and Emily call Father Todd (Michael Krawic), but he is attacked by the little girl who is seemingly possessed. Ryan researches the cult, and looks back at the video tapes, seeing the appearance of a child in 1988, despite not being born until 2005. One night, Leila has an interaction with the demon, and opens the door to another realm, or dimension, which she crawls through and disappears, she is found by her parents the next morning, and they plan to leave. Father Todd performs an exorcism in the house, but the demon strangles and drags him away, but Ryan manages to trap the demon under a white bed sheet soaked in holy water, he finished the prayer. Leila returns to normal and the nightmare appears to be over, but then the demon causes Skylar (Olivia Taylor Dudley) and Mike to meet their fate, and Ryan is impaled. Then Leila is lead through another ""portal"", which transports her back to 1992, to encounter young Katie. Emily follows her daughter and pleads with the demon to bring back her little girl, but she is killed, Leila and the demon walk off together, and the camera cuts. There are references to the other films, including of course the return of Katie (who appears in all films), and this film does sport some relatively impressive special effects, but it is become so predictable, the attempts and tactics to make jump scares are ineffective, the story is boring, and the end scenes drag too long, I think they should leave the series alone now, a pointless and disappointing supernatural horror. Adequate!"
" Isn't it incomplete story... Or the next part is coming
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,7,"First of all, movie is amazing but sometimes it feels what about next is, where does the grandma lois and who is that person which teaching katie and kristie where does than the liela went at the end and how it is connected to the 3rd part and what does the witches want and where hunterr came from, where did then elder katie gone"
" Something of a bore
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,4,"THE GHOST DIMENSION is the latest and last in the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY series, and given the weakness of this particular instalment that can only be a blessing. This is a lame re-tread of the original films, one that tries to be and do something different but ends up just the same. Once again an innocent family documents odd events in their home, events focused around their daughter. The 'twist' is that they have a special camera which can see into the ""ghost dimension"", but this adds up to very little other than a few disappointing CGI effects. The script seems to have been hurried out, with one guy limited to repeating ""what the ****?"" ad nauseum, and the whole thing is something of a bore."
" It was cool.
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,5,"This was my first horror movie from start to finish and Paranormal movie I saw.It starts off not like your traditional movie, but that's okay. The movie is like a reality show, family just being normal. Then creepy things happen. Then scary things happen. Then pop ups happen.I thought the story and acting fine but overall it lacked substance probably from the unusual camera quality.I say try this movie out for a good scary laugh."
" Well...
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,2,"Alright.. I'll be honest, the first one was not my cup of tea all though there were some good scares, and a dope ending. 2 and 3 saved me from hating the franchise, as 4 was kinda decent it had its minor problems. The Marked Ones, absolutely loved it!! It felt refreshing and loved how it connected, the last act when they teamed up was fun to watch too.
The Ghost Dimensionnnnnn.... I actually didn't mind the concept all tho 'Fear of the unseen/unknown' was the point of Paranormal Activity. They severely butchered the half decent concept, with yet a recycled plot of the first 5 with less action and more 'Toby floating around the house for 3D'. Now, I was looking forward to the ending tho, since it is the last one as they confirmed, they could've totally pulled an epic conclusion. They hardly explore the ""ghost dimension"" nor explain/answer questions from previous films that were supposed to be answered.
Toby cant be seen unless they have the ghost camera, and in the previous films he either snaps peoples bones or throws em, in this one hes like.. stabbing everyone through the chests with his giant arm and later someone pukes toby out too (The black stuff) and it's like wait what?... anyways, the movie was just silly and completely missed the point of Paranormal activity."
" I don't understand the harsh reviews.
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,10,Really. What do people want? The story is loyal to the main story and it's following its path. And it's quite interesting in my opinion. I'm wanting to know what will happen after this one. I hope they make a new one. This movie is more of the same. Means it's good. You can trust me. If you haven't watched it don't give attention to those bad reviews. This is a good movie. What it didn't explain everything? It's not supposed to. We want more sequences. Still it explains a lot. People are not really patient. Reviews are so bad that I went to Netflix to watch it before I could buy it. Now I don't have a doubt. I'll get it to my collection. And I hope they keep up the good work.
" Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension utilises the same expired found footage style that made the series monotonously derivative.
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,2,"""The Ghost Dimension""? An entire metaphysical reality that coexists with our own physical realm? A parallel subnet of ghoulish entities and sinister demons? Well, actually it's just a tunnel above a little girl's bed. Who knew! A family move into a house where they discover a specialised camera that detects spectral sightings around their new abode. Little did they know, it's the same antagonistic presence from the previous instalments. You know what that means...! The. Exact. Same. Narrative. Structure. Innocent cute family move in. Objects move. Unexpected noises erupt. The tension ""rises"". Presence increases actions with confidence. People die. Some survive. The end. Except this time, it really is the end. Finished. Concluded. Done. Well, I hope so! I tend to take this franchise with a pinch of salt. I appreciate the technique used in the first few instalments and found them to be atmospheric, yet entirely disposable, horrors. Ultimately boring mind you, but a few moments of tension seemed to always arise. In this concluding chapter, the dull monotonous characters are so absurdly simpleminded that every action they choose to make leaves a bitter aftertaste. Let me illustrate this with a few examples. Shortly after discovering this convenient special camera, they witness a vicious spectral entity manifest adjacent to their daughter. Instead of fleeing the house and showing the tape to suitable authorities, they decide to stay in this house to ""find out what it wants"". The daughter, having never done this before, drew ancient demonic symbols behind her bed. The parents acknowledge this with fear, but do nothing as if it was normal behaviour from her. The plot is littered with these dumbfounded choices that you start to realise these are the worst parents ever. This is without critiquing the horrendous effects, non-existent character development and lack of scares. By the time the nonsensical ending occurs, you've probably given up on the film...and life."

Their daughter Leila (Ivy George) starts speaking to ""Toby"" as brothers Mike (Dan Gill) and Ryan (Chris J.

The feature is all low budget hand held camera including the green cam, but doesn't give us the dreaded foot cam. The movie isn't too deep and allows the viewer to get caught up with the events.

" Please dont come up with anymore parts
",2018-02-15 00:00:00,1,"Did the director of this movie grow up in slums? he really needs to go to school before making any more movies. Its not even worth 1 star. This movie is only about few jobless people filming there own house and even after knowing its haunted brainless mother keeps screaming ""OMG! what is happening"" like really? after knowing its haunted u don't leave the house but continue filming with the lights off the whole time. Its the most predictable and stupid movie i must have ever watched. In your next part (which I hope never comes out) please do not hold the camera at one point and zoom at it slowly, people who went to school would know something is coming up. Bloody third grade movie."
" What a whimper to go out on
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,3,"If this is supposed to be the end of the franchise, what a whimper to go out on. After the dismal fourth film and the interesting fifth film that breathed some new life into the franchise, Paranormal Activity: Ghost Dimension offers little more than a few effective jump scares and a wholly unconvincing plot."
" Nauseating

" must see in 3D, but typical a paranormal flick
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,6,"The most controversial franchise ever I guess because it did started a new era, the era of the found footage flicks but on the other hand it was one of the most disliked horrors by the geeks.Let me say that I always enjoyed it this franchise, I was never scared but have seen it with teens they were so some way they succeeded in their purpose. Guess it was never meant to scare the old fans of the genre.This one came out in 3D and let me tell you that it delivers more in 3D. The ghostly appearances especially in the beginning really works in 3D and it even pops out of your screen as did the end scene. It was told that this is the last and would explain everything. For me it only explained the midwife coven. But it do has an open ending so if they want within a few years they can start all over. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5"

",2017-07-17 00:00:00,1,"Is this some sort of sick joke,is this true?..well I guess it is.

In this,a family are haunted in a house for one particular reason;there house is built on the location of Katie and Kristie's woo ya scary. This is awful,and why? because Mr lazy dude director over here decided to let us see the demon YES,we SAW THE DEMON!! I mean why,why,why would you let us see the demon and it was horrible,it was like that thing from Spider Man. BUT,I will say,in the end,we see his physical form and it is actually quite scary but apart from that this film is a nightmare,like a disgusting nightmare. Well that's that,ain't it,a really good series gone ended with one of the worst films ever,I'll always remember this series for its good times. R.I.P Paranormal Activity 2007-2015,Death:a bad sequel let everyone's ideas float from there head"
" Talk about beating a dead horse!
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,1,"I would have enjoyed this movie and maybe given it a better rating if they had just ditched the hand held / security cameras and stopped pretending it was found footage. It's just getting really old and therefore unconvincing. They have found footage on their found footage which was entirely unnecessary. One of the characters even asks, ""What? Did they film everything?"" while they themselves are filming everything. (Revealing that there is found footage is hardly a spoiler so relax) In fact, the movie is on in the background right now which is an example of how captivating it is. Time to turn it off now. Have a nice day. :)"
" My Personal review
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,5,"A very strange franchise, I can not say uninteresting, but there are a number of shortcomings, the script is not thought out, the parts are sometimes unrelated, even given the insertion from the previous parts into new ones, the camera's permanent effect leads to pain in the eyes and head, the script is strictly speaking very muddy and Not thought out, everything could be laid in an hour and a half, all 7 parts, a lot of garbage. I can see it once, but I would recommend it to someone for nothing, but one way or another it was possible to make a very interesting film.Hierarchy:Paranormal Activity (2007)Paranormal Activity 2 (2010)Paranormal Activity: Tokyo Night (2010)Paranormal Activity 3 (2011)Paranormal Activity 4 (2012)Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones (2014)Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension (2015)"
" Tense, but could have been better
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,4,"I remember seeing this in the theaters, especially in the 3D format, back in 2015 and just got the chills just watching it like any other PA film I've seen; in fact, my heart was pounding against my chest from start to finish! Even though, this wasn't the movie I had hoped to give a satisfactory ending to the series - it could've been better at the end. Remember in the trailers with all those kids and the coven? I had high hopes for that. And that way, the movie would have been more interesting. But no, they left it out. Another feature I found decent was an alternate ending - only on home video - but it's nothing special. I'd like to see a sequel where someone finally kills off Toby, because at the end - all he needed was one drop of blood from one of the coven and he becomes human. Who knows if we'll get that for sure.Tense just like the rest of the franchise, but it could've been better."
" Holy Sh#t, Someone fix this saga.
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,1,"This film is easily the most disgusting, vile, selfish, rude, lazy, insulting, mediocre and shameless piece of crap to ever make it in a movie theater and that is saying a lot already.The connections between every movie EVEN including Tokyo Night (entry that is always excluded/ignored, and it's actually really good) it's fascinating and all of it can make sense with not-that-even-meticulous writing. What happened with the door premise from the Marked ones? it played wonderfully on the end of said movie. What ended up happening with Hunter? Was he just another marked one from the bunch? What happened with Katie? With Lois? (There's a woman that looks like her in The Mark Ones) With Ali Rey after The Marked Ones and/or before? Why such a cheap approach when it came to give ""Toby"" a shape? Inexcusable and unforgivable.This franchise created enough cult following to have fans within the industry that could do justice to the loose ends that people were really interested in, solve mysteries and who knows what else. The Ghost Dimension doesn't solve anything and just offers a tasteless and lazy story, the ghost camera was forced and seemed like an idea out the Looney Tunes.The story had so much substance and so many paths that would have kept the intrigue and the greatness that made the previous entries as good as they were.I'm not trying to be harsh or obnoxious, I just simply loved how the story was developing before this last disaster. Bring back Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman and/or Christopher Landon."
" The End
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,5,"I guess the good thing about this film is that it's the last (so I read). Part four was a significant drop off from the first three so I figured that Ghost Dimension could only go up. Well, it was imperceptibly better than part four which means it was still a disappointment. In this episode we had a little more of a believable reason for setting up and carrying a camera everywhere. The father, Ryan (Chris Murray), found an old camera and found out that the camera is specially outfitted to see paranormal entities. That's cool because now it makes sense that a person has a camera set up in almost every corner of the house. So, unlike the first four renditions of Paranormal Activity, this one gives us glimpses of more than just moving things. But even the actual ghost footage couldn't save this.This movie still follows the same formula as the other editions: small easily explainable disturbances leading up to more unsettling occurrences culminating into the all out spook offensive. I'm not giving anything away here, that is pretty much right out of the ghost movie manual. Yes, there were some variances in the movie to make it slightly fresher but not enough to separate itself from being labeled a cash grab."
" franchise getting old
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,4,"This starts with the end of Paranormal Activity 3. It's 1988 Santa Rosa, California. Dennis is killed. Grandma Lois leads Kristi and Katie upstairs to Kent, another disciple of Tobi. They are told that there will be another. Some 25 years later, Ryan and Emily are the new homeowner with their young daughter Leila. Friend Skyler is visiting. Also uncle Mike has arrived after a bad breakup. They find an old camera and videotapes left from the previous homeowner. The camera has an unusual effect. The tapes are some twenty years old and the people seems to be interacting with the present day world.The franchise is getting old and the story of the girls are being forgotten. Honestly, I barely remember some of the previous movies. It's nice to tie this back to three. This faces many of the same problems as other horrors. There has to be a reason for the family to stay so long in the house. They do call in Father Todd but it's not enough. It's the same and it's old. At some point, the franchise needs to be blown up or it needs to end. The problem is that it's so cheap to make that somebody will make another in the future."
