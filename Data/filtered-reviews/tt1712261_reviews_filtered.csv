" ""Be careful what you instagoogletweetface!""
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,6,"After watching a couple hundred cop and gangster movies, this was the first time I ever heard of reference to a 'triple 9', or in police talk, 'officer down, needs help immediately'. It takes some time into this story in which some dirty cops in league with ex-military personnel, concoct a scheme to take down a police officer as a distraction in order to pull off a heist for the Russian mob. All the while I'm thinking why couldn't the Russian mob pull off these jobs by themselves instead of going through intermediaries, but what do I know? This had the potential to be a gritty crime thriller, and it was up to a point, but in the latter stages it seemed to hit a wall of confusion where it was difficult to figure out what the good guys and bad guys were up to because of the double crosses involved. Even with an extraordinarily stellar cast, none of the principals come across as likeable characters, even Woody Harrelson and Casey Affleck as the cops seeking to take down the crime ring run by Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor). And try as I might, I couldn't relate to Kate Winslet and Wonder Woman Gal Gadot as a pair of Russian sisters heading up a crime syndicate. By the time it's ready to wrap things up, even the bad guys are offing each other, and you might question whether things end up in any positive sort of way. But if you ever wondered how those exploding red dye packs worked in a bank robbery situation, check out the early going and you'll get more than you bargained for."
" pass on it
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,4,I love all the actors but this movie is boring as hell.
" Very strange to me.
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,6,"This seems to be just a standard shoot-em-up movie. Yet it is star studded.I don't know where they got the money, but it likely makes the movie better.If only I could figure out why this movie was made.Anyway certainly worth watching."
" Dirty cops meet the Russians for mostly acceptable viewing
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,A great cast and so-so writing leaves you wanting more at the end. But there are some thrilling scenes to keep you entertained.
" It's not bad movie
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,6,This movie stand right in the middle between not Fantastic in the same time not badThey could use these great group of actors in much better wayBut after all you won't regret watching it
" A Film with No Voice
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,6,"Triple 9 is written by Matt Cook and directed by John Hillcoat and in 2016 was met with average reception and barely broke even at the box office. The film stars Casey Affleck, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Anthony Mackie, Kate Winslet, Woody Harrelson, Gal Gadot, Aaron Paul, among many others. Triple 9 tells the story of a corrupt group of law enforcement working for the Russian/Jewish mafia in Atlanta and while planning their next heist come to the conclusion that in order to pull it off they may just have to take out one of their own.Going into Triple 9, I was somewhat looking forward to it, I remember the trailers featured an interesting premise and with a star-studded cast, I figured it would be something to keep an eye on. After seeing it, Triple 9, is a pretty average film held back by the script's woes. With this group of actors and actresses, everyone was quite good, however, no one really stood out and I feel like that may be due to the story's lack of a protagonist. The film never really makes clear who the true main character is in the film, when it started out I thought maybe it was Chiwetel Ejiofor, then I figured it was Anthony Mackie and near the halfway point or so I thought it was Casey Affleck. I'm not sure if Triple 9 lacked direction or was in need of a better script. The film is competently made, the cinematography isn't anything great, however, is serviceable, the sound mixing is pretty good, the movie moves at a good pace, I was never bored and the action is thrilling and suspenseful when it needs to be. It's during the film's downtime when there's no action going on that the plot sort of meanders about as the filmmakers try to tell its story. Which the story is intriguing, albeit nothing original, however, there was enough going on and the premise interesting enough that it should be entertaining however the movie sort of falters due to a lack of a voice. The film bounces around between characters that it doesn't give the audience enough time to get to know them, you sort of get a surface level understanding of each character and even near the end the film is still introducing new details about a character, such as one of the main characters having a substance abuse problem that was never mentioned earlier. I've enjoyed films in the past that don't have a clearcut protagonist, however with Triple 9, it was just not pulled off correctly; the movie desperately needed a voice.Apart from that major gripe with the film that really brings it down, the rest of the movie is mostly fine. I was entertained throughout, the story is gritty and the setting handled well, I felt that the city of Atlanta was a nice backdrop for this film, so much so that it almost felt like a character of its own sometimes. The film also handles its suspenseful moments well, I was on the edge of my seat when I needed to be and I didn't always know where the story was going, although, that might be due in part to the aforementioned lack of a protagonist. Nonetheless, the third act sort of turns into a Tarantino-inspired finale with everyone trying to get back at one another and sure was enjoyable.In closing, Triple 9, is held back by the direction of the script, had there been a consistent voice throughout from one or two characters who push the story along, I really think this film would have faired a lot better. With a star-studded cast like this, you expect more and while the performances are good, nothing about the rest of this film is noteworthy; it's something I see myself forgetting down the line. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining film that I can recommend for a matinee viewing if you have nothing going on; it's not going to be a film that will impress with its numerous action tropes and lack of a voice, however, the movie moves at a brisk enough pace and does a good enough job to keep the intrigue of the viewer. I am giving Triple 9 a 6/10."
" Lacked Pop
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,6,"Enough to keep me interested but seriously, it lacked the pop. That ending was weak as crap."
" An Excellent Movie Full Of Sub Story Details - Great Actors
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,01/24/2021 I watched this movie once before today back on 12/09/2020. Even with an excellent cast I somehow got lost in the sub stories of the primary storyline which ruined the movie for me then but today it all came together and the movie was much more enjoyable for me to watch. There's plenty going on all the way through this movie so viewers will have to pay attention to the details or you'll miss some of the important sub story details. I like the ending and definitely recommend this movie. Bon Appetit'
" Rough one
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,8,"Dark, gritty, violent and very intense. At no point 999 tries to weasel out of anything. There's no good vs bad cop, or gang X against gang Y. It's simply everybody against everybody. A twisted, action and suspense fueled movie with a worldclass Kate Winslet in an unusual role. Clear recommendation if u are done with half baked action/crime labeled wannabes."
" Add it to your watched list, because you won't remember it next week
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,6,It just an okay movie. In a couple of weeks you will have forgotten all about it.
" The Bad Reviews Are For Unrealized Potential.
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,8,"This movie is rated like a disappointed teacher rates a smart kid who had A potential but did B work: he gets a C. It features a far better than average cast with some members not given enough to do, e.g., Kate Winslet and Gal Gadot, who apparently owed some people favors. The story has bones but the script didn't put enough flesh on the characters to make you care about them. So, you get a cop flick with a decent premise, production values and lots of action-but you watch uninvolved an unmoved. That said, if it's a rainy Saturday afternoon and you're tapped out for the moment on stories about righting wrongs based on race, sex or national origin, open a cold snack and sit back."
" A good, gritty movie and great cast of actors
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,8,"Not bad, tough, gritty, different kind of story, including about some bad to the bone cops. A really good cast - I count 11 Oscar nominations and 2 wins between Winslett, Affleck, and Harrelson. Gotta like a movie politically incorrect enough to have the lines ""The bank robbers are heavily armed and speak Spanish. That narrows it down to about a quarter of the city."""
" Made little to No sense
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,4,"Plot holes, plot conveniences, and a whole lot of nonsense! Gal Gadot is gorgeous and I might have forgiven this movie if they showed her more"
" Kept my Interest
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,5,Training day meets Marauders. Kept my interest but the storyline got a bit complicated. Not sure who you are supposed to be rooting for in this meeting.
" Confusing
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,4,"Great actors, but story was sort of all over the place twisted. Difficult to tell who was actually the bad guys and who were the good guys. In the end I still don't know WHY exactly WHO did WHAT they did. I was left with a lot of questions."
" Chiwetel Eljifor is Jada Pinkett Smith, Anthony Mackie is Queen Latifah, but this is NOT ""Set It Off""
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,7,"Wonderful cast, but weak plot twist. But still great entertainment. Wonderful for those who have been scrolling through Netflix too long."
" Acted Well. Intense Action Scenes. That's it.
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,6,"Basically just what most others have said: Great acting, Great action direction but nothing of a plot.As another had said as well: I really wanted to like it but when a movie tries so hard with realism and intensity, the lack of plot is so obviously clear that it becomes (expectedly becomes) a let down.I wish more movies wouldn't just be about retaliation & ""doing a job"" but has more substance and foundation building. Other than that, it was acted & directed well."
" Good movie, Great cast
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,8,8/10 because Woody Harrelson's fake teeth are the worst
" The Kate Winslet You Don't Know
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,8,"I read a lot of reviews before seeing this movie. I agree with some of the comments stating that there are too many sub-plots. However, this does not make for a bad movie, just a very complex one best viewed on the DVR so you can rewind and understand the variety of character connections. This movie would have been better served as a two part sequel. Anyone of the plots could make a very good movie if expanded. All of the actors are superior and believeable. The lead premise is centered on dirty cops, but what's difficult to understand is how they originate as a gang and how they are related to Kate Winslet who plays a very interesting and convincing mob boss. Who would have thought she could be this good, and rivals in the realm of John Gotti and old school mafia. She is fierce, ruthless and deserves her ultimate fate. Don't be fooled by the bad reviews, just remember to pay attention. The gun battles are realistic and not over-done. I think this movies rivals well against something like Alpacino's Heat. If you like that movie, you definitely like this one."
" Not good enough to end as unsatisfyingly as it did.
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,6,"I thought it was a fun action-thriller with some mystery wrapped inside of it, but everyone friggin' dies....There is close to no real satisfying ""feel-good"" moment except when Woody kills the last cop left. The way everyone else died was so...unsatisfying. I don't mind it when everyone dies, but that kind of character kill off, at least to me, is reserved for deep, twisting, hard-to-figure-out plots like Tarantino movies.I would have loved it if some of the main characters survived or had some redemption arc, but they all just died....and the movie wasn't too complex. If you're going to kill off such a star studded cast, at least make it interesting...otherwise, just roll with the fun action-thriller where all the cool people live and the plot isn't out of this world."
" Left me hanging in the end
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,4,"Great cast and enough good action to keep me watching. But when the story took, what I thought was a twist, it just ended. There are a few holes and not enough character development that I was ready to overlook...but that ending. If felt like it came from a different movie or that a major part of the movie was edited out. It was a scene that would have been nice to have some kind of follow up to. But no, just credits. Too bad, I was enjoying it."
" Triple 9 is a forgettable look into America's underbelly
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,7,"While this is a good ""actor's movie"" it's not a movie for the faint of heart. Stocked full of the best character actors of the modern era, it's yet another in a recent trove of storylines with no redeeming characters.
You just want this mess to be over with! Directing,photography and editing are Topsfield. But it's best that nothing more than your monthly Netflix subscription be spent on it."
" Wasted talent.
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,8,"Good movie but I was expecting more taking in consideration the cast. You don't need Kate Winslet, and Gal Gadot to be wasted like this. I was expecting a stronger plot to elevate to the highness of such talent."
" It was like a drunk driver that was severely wasted trying to get home 30 miles away
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,2,"All star cast 100% but the move fell flat, it was like they tried to resuscitate this movie several times and it still couldn't make it, it was like whoever decided to to make this movie the idea was great in their head and probably look good on paper, it was like putting an pretty dress on a pig, the movie was a train reck, and I still don't understand the ending, was woody Harrelson the bad guy in the movie....... why, will somebody please make it make sense??"
" I turned it off with 8 minutes to go
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,4,The long stare in the parking lot really did me in. Casey Aflek is a terrible actor. I don't know how he gets roles.
" Choppy continuity and editing , but good cop drama
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,7,"Dont be put off by the reviews. This film COULD have been another HEAT, I think that the real film is on the cutting room floor. Great performances all around, Winslet really brings the evil , but also Mackie and Ejiofor are outstanding.
Gal Gadot was illegally beautiful, even though she only had 90 seconds of show time.
Woody Harelson nearly blows it with a performance that is close to cartoonish.
Great action scenes"
" A Bland Heist Movie
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,5,"For a heist movie it is an original storyline. I thought using a 999 to carry out a heist was unique, unfortunately the way they told the story was bland and borderline boring. The dialogue between characters was not well written, and the location of the final heist was not well selected. Why the writers chose to place the item of interest at DHS was a head scratcher. Then on top of that there were practically no security at DHS when they got there. It made for a boring finale.The movie itself is extremely watchable but this movie could have easily been a great one. If you are looking for a heist movie I would recommend ""Den of Thieves"", or ""The Town"" before this one.57/100."
" An ALL out action crime thriller
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,7,"Here's the thing... You take 9 or 10 High-caliber actors, stick them together in a pretty run-of-the-mill action heist flick, and everyone expects it to be another Oscar sweep with the big brooms... That does happen sometimes I suppose... What we got this time however was just an exciting, well-acted run-of-the-mill action heist flick. Not perfect by a long-shot, but a solid almost 2 hours of entertainment.
This thing was non-stop action, loosely interspersed with moments of smoldering intensity, and barely enough exposition from a couple of main characters, to drag you by the wrist down the cobble-stone path of a plot...
The acting is superb, as would be expected. It's effortless to imagine that all these characters are intertwined, or have known each other for years. Quality stuff... The movie has a fitting dark and gritty tone, and you almost feel relief when night turns to day, or indoors turns to outdoors.
The camera-work is clean, even in the car-chase or walking/running scenes the shaky-shake isn't too bad. There is some fairly original gun-play too amidst the general melee that seems to be always going on.
Chiwetel calls all the shots, Casey chews ALL the gum, Gal's legs go ALL the way up, Woody drinks ALL the booze, Kate uses ALL the peroxide, Anthony smokes ALL the Black & Milds, and Aaron does ALL the remaining drugs... This is an ALL out kind 'a movie, and I had ALL the fun watching it."
" I Like This Kind of Action Movie
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,9,"Somehow there are many bad reviews about this film. In my opinion, this film is brilliant enough to wrap a crime thriller with lots of characters in it. I've watched enough action films, and this one is enough to meet my expectations in action films. The whole film feels very tense, with good action scenes, an interesting plot (especially the interconnections between the characters), and a little touch of interesting drama. Really a fantastic ride!I like this film, but it still divides the screenplay between the characters quite evenly, even though the consequence is that each character can't be digged deeper into its characterization because of the problem of the screentime that focuses on the same core story. Even so, the story can treat it all. It's like an action film with a captivating adventure. All of the cast here are brilliant in playing their respective roles, thank goodness that getting lots of classy actors can help the plot and characters come alive. Scoring here is very important, because throughout the film, the scoring helps to feel the tension throughout the film. Not only scoring tho, but the cinematography here also makes tense with a typical take action but still can be enjoyed."
" 'Opinion is not fact' - I liked this - despite others reviews !
",2020-07-22 00:00:00,7,"Stupidly, I read reviews before watching - unusual for me. Cleverly, I decided to watch it anyway, and was pleasantly surprised. The films cracks along at an action packed speed, decent characters, good plot, lots of action, convoluted plot. Downside? Kate Winslet not entirely convincing, some characters not fully explored or fleshed out - Affleck, Mackie, the Gal Gadot/Chiwetel Ejiofor relationship......but I really enjoyed it. Its not an 'A' grade film, but its certainly worth a watch."
" Good, but not as good as 'The Departed'
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,7,"The whole time watching this movie, I was thinking of 'The Departed'. I have only ever given a 10/10 rating nine times before... and 'The Departed' was one of those nine times that I gave something a 10/10.This movie is essentially 'The Departed', but it obviously has a few short-comings ie. a weaker cast, a somewhat weaker plot/script, and 40minutes less runtime. If those 3 things were improved upon, then this film could EASILY have been a 9/10.However, this movie is still worth watching at least once (especially if you liked 'The Departed'). The characters in the movie make stupid, irrational decisions a couple of times which irritated me, but other than that I don't really have any major criticism."
" Average
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,6,"Good : combat scenes, bank robbery scenes.
Bad: screenplay and direction is all scattered.
Overall it's just an average which could have been better executed"
" Awful cop movie
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,1,"This movie was hard to stomach. It has so many inconsistencies and no plot. I have heard people compare this to Den of Thieves and I'm sorry but it doesn't even come close to comparison.
Save your money and watch Den of Thieves.If this movie would have cast Steven Seagal then perhaps he could have saved it."
" Star studded cast
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,9,This star studded cast all performed really well! Chiwetel Ejiofor is a always fascinating lead such an amazing actor I could watch him all day. Add to that Casey Affleck's quiet intensity. Then Norman Reedus commanding leadership; nice to see his hair out of his eyes. Woody Harrelson solid as always. Kate Winslet can be a tad wooden but she's a real bad woman so it fits here. Anthony Mackie & Aaron Paul round out this interesting group of people. Could have seen more of Gal Gadot and Michelle Ang it maybe would have helped us care more about the characters. Could have used more twists for a thriller but I think for an afternoon popcorn movie it was really good. 🍿😊
" I enjoyed it. Dark crime thriller. Don't expect a masterpiece. ( C+Movie ) My Ratings 8/10
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,8,Not the most original but certainly more than worth while thanks to a stellar cast especially the phenomenal so good and weird and true it almost hurts and surely inspires Michael Kenneth Williams (Omar chalky white plus hap and leoanrd ) especially with a little buzz and some ferve swerve a competent watchable but never ground breaking flick
" One of the worst films I've ever watched.
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,1,"I had this film over 2 or 3 years. But I've never had a chance to watch. I planned to watch it several times. But the other films took over and so, I watched the other ones instead.I'm glad that I didn't watch it before until now because of the quality of this film. This is one of those films that I've stopped watching in the middle. The main reason is that the film is so boring and dull. Plus, there are a lot of f words which make me uncomfortable. And what they want to show isn't that much clear. Even the involvement of Kate Winslet couldn't save the film. I can't believe that she's in this dumb film. Thus, it's totally a bad film of the year 2016.Talking about Kate Winslet, I also can't quite believe she uses in Russian accent. That's kind of strange thing to see. I'm not that much fan of Russians, so, it's very not good to see her as a Russian.The reason why the film is bad is that it doesn't show things clearly. In the very first scene, they robbed bank and took a box from the bank. But they didn't explain what that thing is. Moreover, the ones who did that robbing are police officers. What made them to do robbing instead of simply do police jobs? Furthermore, they didn't explain the connection between those Mexican people and the head thing. I don't even know why they are shooting at those Mexican people. From the beginning to the middle of the film, I was watching blindly. That's why I said this film is so bad.All in all, I really had high hope for this one as it has over 6 rating here on IMDB. So, I thought it might be a good film. But after watching the half, I really disappointed. How did they make such a bad film? The film is really terrible and there are a lot of good films out there. Leave this one and go watch the other films instead. Watching this one isn't worth to spend time and money. So, I recommend you NOT to watch this one if you value your time and money."
" Good movie ignore the poor reviews.
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,8,"I think there is some sort of poor reviews group think happening here. The action sequences are fantastic, gritty and realistic. If you understand guns and basic combat tactics this film captures it very well.I also think that characters were a lot of fun with interesting and witty dialogue.Not all films have to be about character arcs. There is a lot more to a good film."
" no honor amongst thieves
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,9,There are some gems out there : i liked the suspense . and everybody gets their dues . very satisfying .
" What happened to the lights
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,4,Something is actually wrong with the post production team for such terrible lighting. It didn't add to the mystique nor did it establish a time or place.
" Ok what did I just watch?
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,3,"They had so many great names, but didn't use the potential, coming out of that...I don't even know where to start. We had two plotlines, one working as a cop-thriller the other one as a bank-job-movie but nothing seemed to make sense, the plot lines crashed, the ending was pure horse ...Almost unwatchable..."
" Triple yawn
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,1,"Watched this film because of it's amazing cast, but what a disappointment. Bad acting + boring plot = waste of time."
" Not so bad
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,6,"If you are waiting for something like training day you'd better lower your expectations, but this is a pretty entertaining movie to watch. Very good casting and interesting plot."
" In a film about cops, dirty cops and robbers...
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,2,"There's only one good guy and that's Affleck, the rest are dirt bags - including his uncle, played by harrelson, who we initially assume to be honest - so thats It in a nutshell. Comparisons with heat are quite erroneous."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,2,"Wow super garbage. Very boring and forgettable. some of the worst directing I've seen. I was laughing at certain parts later in the movie. I also had a bad experience going back to amc Chicago ridge, which has the worst image quality I've ever seen, worst sound quality I've ever heard, and smallest screen in any theater I've been to. That theater should be demolished (1 viewing)"
" Terrible editing ruined it
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,3,"Potential was there to be a pretty good movie
Rating could've been doubled if the way the movie was edited didn't totally kill any pace to the film
Frustrating that the director & editor blew it like they did"
" warmth
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,1,"I'ts taken triple attempts to get to the end of this l just found couple characters too grating & overbearing mainly new kid on the block I'm so tough & cool afflek.One other was aron paul just found him incredibly annoying with Woody not far behind,& I'm usually a fan of his.The story & action was reasonable if not somewhat disjointed."
" Absolutely stunning
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,10,Tense action; deep trauma; pure drama and close beautiful relationships between complicated characters make this action thriller a fantastic ride. Editing and timing brilliance are apparent throughout... Now this is a fantastic cop action movie!
" Boring
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,2,There's not a proper ending and the story isn't quite understandable nor enjoyable. People may come to watch the film just because of the good actors. But they ain't even good in this film.
" Brillant photography, good movie.
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,7,"This movie is shot witout the new high sensitivity settings seen so often nowadays. Look at the brake light. They are always red, not pinkish. Its rather shot with high iso setting, when needed, what can be seen on its sometimes high grainyness. Its dark but always extremely well photographed. Very raw. The colours are punchy, everything is as Kodak as it can get with digital. Very nice perscpectives, good cutting. Its pure eye candy. There is no bluring or denoizing going on. When it gets grainy there is also always a lighter part in the picture composition that keeps everything in balance. High contrasted. The photography perfectly matches the story and the acting. Its a dark thriller where reality bites, set in a apocalyptic part of our society. Some flaws, like some overacting here and there but all in all a solid masterpiece."
" Bad reviews corrupt reviews
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,9,This was a great movie anything less than 7 rating is a corrupt review
" Great Cop thriller and cast!
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,10,"One of the best cop action thriller I've seen. Great cast, acting, storyline, layers and even the ending didn't disappoint (usually the risk). Better than Sleepless (Jamie Foxx) which was the last decent one I saw of this kind. Highly recommend it!"
" Starry cast but a nascent set of characters
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,5,"This nihilist crime-caper thriller has plenty of big movie stars and explosive action but it's low on character development. It's classic style over substance.
Kate Winslet and Woody Harrelson may have fun playing their characters but their quirks don't add up to much. Exposition is underdeveloped for the villains, the MacGuffin unexplained. Most of what is to be valued is the ultraviolence which doesn't sustain the tension. It's a collection of good scenes and exciting sequences but the ending seems open ended and without much hope for a functioning Atlanta police department."
" So many celebrity faces make up such a film
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,5,"So many celebrity faces make up such a film. There are no ups and downs, want to show each character's entanglement, the results are not divided between primary and secondary, the feeling of chaos throughout the article"
" Enjoy it for what it is - a great crime movie.
",2018-12-11 00:00:00,8,"There seems to be a lot of negativity in the reviews as if it's ripping off Heat and cannot possible compete with it's mastery but really it's a totally different film. The action is good the story has grit, strong performances and a point. SO many Police movies have similarities but there is a bit of all sorts in here and I really think it's worth a watch. It has uses drama like The Equalizer in that it's required and not over used, the characters don't have super powers and are not immune from pain. The story hints at political themes and shows life in the underworld much like it is, with little remorse, no easy way out and a greedier person just ready to come along. I love the movie Heat and I'm glad there's another great movie to add to my favorite score/gang and organised crime movie list."
" Good crime thriller
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,6,"Great cast in this film, loved Gal Gadot and Kate Winslet in it they make great Russians :)
It's a grim film, full of violence and no humour but if you like crime films you will like this just don't have high expectations."
" Triple Wack
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,1,"The film really isn't clear on why Michael and his crew were doing jobs for the Russians. Were they doing it for money? Where they doing it to get Michael son back? (This would be the least, cause the crew never talked about it). Were they doing it for this ""unclear"" reason?Woody Harrselson acting was bad. The detectives served no purpose in the film, because there was little investigations shown."
" Expected a bit more
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,6,"The plot and cast of Triple 9 held much potential but did not deliver as expected. The film follows a group of highly skilled criminals that execute action packed heists. The major revelation is that two of these criminals are policemen. Apart from that, the story does not hold much suspense and revelation. Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is forced by Irina Vlaslov (Kate Winslet), a criminal kingpin, to do these jobs by threatening Atwood with the safety of his son (not something new). The story unravels as they plan the 'final' heist where, as expected, everything goes wrong. There is some parts of the film which I enjoyed. However, with such an all-star cast, it did not live up to the expectation."
" Tough true to life dirty cop movie with original twists and magnificent acting. Not for the sensitive of heart and not suited for the masses, who long for a happy ending.
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,9,"One of the toughest true to life portrayals of dirty cops ever recorded on the movie screen. Seen so many dirty cop movies, only a few are truly great and ""Triple 9 "" is one of them. If you like dirty cop movies then you just GOTTA see this one, it blew me away. Not suited for the sensitive of heart though, because there is some pretty gross violence in it. And not suited for those who like to see a happy ending. Not suited either for those who are sensitive to racial stigmas, a lot of reviews were mentioning this sensitivity. A lot of reviewers also had criticism over the fact that there isnt a real leading character which you can sympathise with. That's correct, although I thought that Casey Affleck was the leading man together with Chiwitel Ejiofor.This director John Hillcoat dares to makes pictures that dont please the masses, hence the reviews of many people who dont understand the story or dont like to watch depressing stories. Depressing it is, but depressing can be brilliant, when it is directed with excellence. And it is excellent. Acting, story, editing, photography and soundtrack all are up there with the very best in Triple 9.The story is about a bunch of criminal cops who get pressured by the russian mob to do a risky heist for them. Double cross betrayal is the red line through this story in which almost everybody gets wasted through deceit. No fun for the masses, who long for a happy ending and long to see stereotypical heroes. Enough of those movies have been made already. Dead boring to me. ""Triple 9"" is different though. It is depressingly, harsh and I was still shocked and thrilled by it, even after I had watched it over 3 times already.Praise for all the actors in it, but in particular for Casey Affleck and Woody Harrelson, who play the good cops. But the gangsters are acting formidable too. A very surprising role for Kate Winslet as a russian mobster. I dont usually like Kate Winslet, but in here she truly portrays the coldest b*tch I have seen on the screen for years. Chiwitel Ejiofor must be mentioned also for his excellent portrayal of a father who inside is teared apart with silent desperation. This is truly an actors movie, like all movies by director John Hillcoat are. The formidable acting is what makes this movie surpass all the other mediocre dirty cop movies. Even the bad reviews mention the great acting in it!""Triple 9"" truly achieves a new level of brilliance, as far as dirty cops movies are concerned. Seen it several times already and it gives me the chills every time. ""Heat"" with Al Pacino and ""Training Day"" with Denzel Washington are better than this one. But ""Triple 9"" comes very close in the true to life portrayals of dirty cops and gangsters. It's a shockingly violent and suspenseful rollercoaster, which is an anti-dote for the usual glorification of violence in Hollywood."
" Solid
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,8,Even though it's solidly made and great work by the ensemble cast it could have been great if helmed by Scorsese or Mann. With so many characters this could have taken more time to give an epic feel to it but nevertheless a gritty crime thriller with realistic action pieces showcasing the unflinching world of dirty cops.
" a little confusing
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,6,"A group of corrupt police officers in Atlanta are on the hook to steal for the Russian mob, with each of them engaging with their own ever shifting lines of morality. One cop's son is used as a pawn by the son's mother, who is the sister of the Russian mob boss trying to get her husband out of a Russian prison. Follow that so far? Yep, it's pretty convoluted. As far as the casting, Aaron Paul as a useless junkie wasn't a good move. It is hard to feel sympathetic for his character, and you find yourself just wanting him out of the way as the movie progresses. Refreshing was a barely recognizable Kate Winslet as the Russian mob matriarch, and Casey Affleck not playing his usual morose type of character. Also, Woody Harrelson does a great job as Casey Affleck's uncle, an alcoholic detective on his last legs, but still with keen police instincts and the desire to protect his nephew's life and career as a young officer."
" Director Should Dial 911 Instead
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,5,"""999"" or ""Triple-9"" is police radio code for Officer Down (I couldn't verify this tidbit in a quick online search, but I digress) I love gritty cop shows: from The Shield to its milder network version on NBC ""Shades of Blue"" or give me movies such as ""Dark Blue"" (Kurt Russell) or ""Training Day"" (Denzel Washington). So I was ready to really like this one, and given the all-star cast, a slam dunk for sure. Wow, was I disappointed! As many commenters have noted, these crooked cops are involved in the Russian mob and we're given no reason why these police officers are doing what they do. Just hinting at ""money"" or greed is not enough. Who are these people and how did they end up in this crazy situation? Sadly, the writer and director doesn't think those questions are important. So we're immersed in what I call ""cop porn"" where we cut out any back story or context and just cut to ""the good parts"" But in this case, without the back story, we don't care about any of the characters or what's transpiring on the screen. So a lengthy (and preposterous) shootout and chase in a gang-infested Atlanta housing development has no weight for us. It's like watching a bad video game. I don't know how they talked these A-list stars into making this turkey, but if the neuralizer from Men In Black really works, their agents should pool their $ and buy as many as it takes."

After pulling one heist, they are tasked with a second one where they would need a lot of time. They opt to create a diversion by killing a cop, creating a 999 call. This would give them the time.While we get that plan early, it isn't executed until late in the film. What the bad guys are up against is a salty Woody Harrelson detective with paid informants and quite the wordsmith. Outside of the Harrelson character, the film was a run of the mill crime drama/thriller.Guide: F-words. No sex or nudity."
" Full with stars but not bright
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,6,"The idea of bringing great stars together was not bad.Because it was the individual performance that kept the movie alive.I have not watch a complicated movie in the last decade that this title.It was difficult to truly understand the content and plot.Casting was also not great,character combination was awful."
" ""Nothing is Black and White""
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,8,"Triple 9 is a movie that has mostly been forgotten. It did poor at the box office, got mixed reviews and didn't do enough to get major attention, but this is one the critics were a bit too harsh on. Triple 9 is by no means a masterpiece, but it is none the less thrilling, suspenseful and mostly well done. The film is set in Atlanta where a group of criminals attempts to pull of a huge heist and part of that heist is getting the police to all be drawn to a code 999, officer down. The plot itself is rather interesting and is a main reason for keeping viewer attention and interest to the story. The cast is great all around. Woody Harrelson might come off as a bit over the top, but he was none the less entertaining. The cast does a great job even with the script being just, fine. It isn't an awful script, but there issues with pacing that stand out, but they aren't enough to truly affect the scenes that transpire throughout. The direction is pretty great for the whole film. All action scenes are very well done with a ton of suspense and the violence is very much a strong addition. The violence may be too much for some, but I thought it was done very well. The editing during these action scenes was pretty excellent, the opening heist was my favorite part of the movie and that was helped by the solid editing and crisp direction. The editing during dialogue scenes was not as good, but also not enough to take me out of the movie. Although some scenes might not be as necessary as other's nothing felt severely out of a place. If the actions scenes weren't as excellent as they are these issues might stand out more.Overall, Triple 9 is no Ocean's Eleven or Reservoir Dogs, but is a great film, with several great moments of tense action, strong performances and solid direction. There are issues with the script and editing during dialogue scenes wasn't the best, but in the end I would be lying if I said I didn't think Triple 9 was a great movie that I think got less praise than it deserved. Again this is not a perfect film, but it's definitely better than the okay movie the critics made it to be."
" Pretty good movie. Afleck elevates it to an 8
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,8,"The movie keeps you on your toes and has a ton of action, bad guys, good guys and everything in between. Casey Afleck plays his outsider cop character very well as is becoming customary as he climbs up the chart of best young actors.Honestly the story isn't anything inspirational or transforming and it's a bit violent and gory but if you're a fan of Afleck then it'll deliver."
" The cast alone rates a 7
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,7,"I'm a fan of John Hillcoat (especially the criminally underrated ""Lawless"") so I had to check this one out. It's a great premise, and reminded me in some ways of Tarantino and ""Reservoir Dogs"" with a gritty and ultra-violent realism. If you are a fan of action/crime then you'll enjoy this"
" This film is bad, i'm unsure how they misused so much talent
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,1,"This film is bad, I'm unsure how they misused so much talent.It's just a badly written predictable film populated by stereotypical characters - the explosives expert you crossed gives you a package? Christ, he may as well have written 'BOMB' in massive letters on it or had a comically large fuse sticking out of it.From time to time great actors make poor films, in this case, that plural is true - many actors in this are great but my god did all of their 'miss' columns get an addition when this wrappedI saw this at a secret screening roughly around the time of Deadpool' release, it was never going to be that but the screen was packed with people thinking or hoping it may just be that but no.I have yet to see so many people exit a film in such a steady stream - it took a good 5 minutes for people to exit when 'Triple 9' came up and people after the initial exodus kept getting up and leaving until I think the last person who didn't stick it out left FORTY-FIVE MINUTES into the film, this is about 40% of the film, I have never seen a film be that bad that someone has got to that point and not been able to endure the rest of it and better yet, the cinema I saw it in had two screens playing this as demand was so high and BOTH had this 'nope' occur with people leaving until quite a while into the filmI can't rate this 0/10 as there isn't an option but please know I absolutely am doing that with my '1'"
" So many good actors wasted
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,5,"Casey, why do this after Manchester? Kate, why this after a good one in Reader? Woody, you lowered your standards. Chinwetel plays a really dumb cop believing the Russians would let his kid go. You do just 1 job for the mob and they got your by you caj**nes. Casey said he followed the Atlanta cops for a few days but he sure didn't learn much. The film had poor police procedures that even I, a civilian would not use. No wonder this film went straight to video. I never heard of it until I borrowed this from my local library. Skip this."
" Good movie, worth the time if you like shoot'em ups.
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"So, should you watch or not? Yes if you like shoot'em up films. The characters are dirty and gritty. It has a lot of great actors in it. I like them all and they all do a great job. I didn't even know that was Kate Winslett as the Russian. Is this an Oscar contender, of course not. None of the movies I like ever are."
" Hall Of Fame Cast Meets Mediocre Writing
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,7,"It seems I didn't hate this movie as much as some of the other reviewers, but it's definitely a far cry from where it should have been. The acting is still great, but with such an amazing ensemble of actors, you naturally come to expect so much more. It's not the worst movie ever made, just a let down with all the potential it had."
" Should have been better
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Sometimes, you see a film advertised and you think 'How can this possibly fail?' Then, upon sitting through it, you wonder how the film-makers managed to make something that looked so awesome come across as so mediocre. And that's what 'Triple 9' is – mediocre. It's not bad. I didn't hate it. I just thought that, judging by the acting talent on display, that it should have been so much more special than what it actually was.It's about a squad of 'dirty' cops who, along with upholding the bits of the law that suit them, also help criminals rob banks. But, somewhere along the way they seemed to forget that criminals – being criminals – can't always be trusted to uphold their side of a bargain. Naturally, the gang they're working for want a little more than was originally offered and conflict arises.The reason Triple 9 looked so good was the cast of characters – anything with Norman Reedus (or 'Daryl' from The Walking Dead) and Aaron Paul (or 'Jessie' from Breaking Bad) can't be all bad, can it? Well, like I say, it's not all bad, it's just pretty forgettable. Apart from one scene that occurred around the middle of the film where the cops storm a drugs den – that's pretty intense and comes across as well researched as to how real police would undertake such an operation. However, it's been about a week since I watched Triple 9 and, apart from that and the meaning of the phrase 'Triple 9' itself, there really isn't that much I can remember about it. Or rather than the actors I really wanted to see in the film aren't in it as much as I'd hoped and, where they were, they were criminally underused.I know I'm being harsh. But it's just if you've seen as many 'cops and robbers' movies as I have over the years then you really need something very different to set one apart. And this one just didn't have what I was looking for. Yes, it's stylish and well-directed, plus you have the acting talent on offer and, if you're looking for realism then you'll find a fair amount of violence here. However, in the course of film history, I'm guessing that this will just be written off as yet another cops and robbers movie. Pity."
" Crooked cops, gangsters, bank robbers and bullets fly through Atlanta in the film Triple 9.
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,6,"So last night I decided to make a couple of banana and blueberry smoothies, have a lazy night, and watch the movie Triple 9 with my dad. I remember when this film first came out, and I really wanted to see it. It has an amazing cast, the choreography and camera work look great, and overall it looked like a nice chill out and watch kind of flick. The criminals in this world can do pretty much, whatever they want, because the cops are the biggest criminals. The Israeli/Russian mob in Atlanta of all places, forces these cops to rob banks and do more ruthless acts of crime.The opening to this movie is off the chain. It has a bank-robbing scene, a car chase, a cool shoot out, great action scenes, and cinematography, and it is all done with so much style. This movie really does have amazing looking scenes, and this is a director (John Hillcoat) I was thinking could be a potential to direct a Batman movie.The beginning is awesome, but the movie slowly begins to fade away after that. It's like they blew their entire load in the beginning. Which I understand you want to start things off on a high note. But contain yourself, hold some of that load for later. Damn, that sounds weird. But I'm sure you get the picture. This movie does a real good job of making Atlanta look scary. Woody Harrelson, high off his ass and wearing a werewolf mask in Atlanta is enough to keep me away from Atlanta for a while put it that way. Even though my Granddad lives thereoh well. When I'm not scared anymore, I'll come visit you. Don't blame me, blame Triple 9.Also, I thought it was cool how the movie kept calling them dirty cops, and some of the cast members who play cops look dirty, worn down, and grungy. To keep things simple, Aaron Paul pretty much plays the same character from Breaking Bad. He looks sweaty, grungy, drugged out, and really does portray his character as if he has been through a lot.The cast is my favorite part about this entire movie. But the movies biggest problem for me is I don't know who the protagonist is, and I can't relate to any of the characters. I love Casey Affleck as an actor. On the other hand, his character in this is very bland in my opinion. All I got from his character is that he chews bubble gum to look tough, and he is a newbie on this particular force. It's not that he is a weak actor, because he is not, it's the material that falls a little short. Chiwetel Ejiofor's character is the most well rounded out of everyone.Also, anyone who knows me, knows I love meh some good ol' Gal Gadot. Gal Gadot is starting to become one of my favorite actresses. She is lovely, tough, dedicated, seems very nice in person, and I think she has the potential to go down in film history, as a famous bad ass action female star, like Pam Grier and Sigourney Weaver. Unfortunately, her character is not very well developed, and she really does not have sh*t to do in this movie. I never thought I would say this about her, but you could have taken her out of the movie and it would have not made it any better or worse. This movie I feel like could have been a little bit more original. It feels like so many other movies and television shows we've seen before. Just to name some examples, this movie reminded me of Training Day, The Shield, The Town, and Street Kings.Overall, in my opinion, this film has a convoluted story, too many characters, it could have been more original, it does have great action, great cinematography, and I love this director. But the script could have had more structure to its surface. This is the kind of film where you see it playing on TV one day, you have nothing better to do, and you just watch it while doing something else. That doesn't mean it is terrible, because it is not. It's the kind of movie you can watch while preparing a banana and blueberry smoothie put it that way. I believe the film Triple 9 earns a6 out of 10!Speaking of blowing a load early, I'm gonna blow a load a little early because I'm ready to check out of here. Thank you all for reading, and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)"
" Triple 9 level of ugliness!
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,1,"We the people have collectively manholes covers sitting on/over their heads; they (the mob) have willfully lost the capacity for creative thinking in the arts and other sciences, and so judgments' in regards to quality of so-called bottom feeding consumer entertainments are paralleling, that non-thinking, as a priority. For the born again yahoo flat landers who've been so oppressed in the counter culture of backwardness, which they also presume to love and take pleasure in, have shrunken to such smallness as to accept and delight in any mere excessive fusion of violence through canned manipulations of sight and sound. Rather than carry a seamless conception of true creative beauty through tapping into some instances, which replicate possible potential of the mind, even in such a low/lesser medium, as the currently almost total absurdity of so-called films, which by degree could be all elevated should a greater people come forward and thus demand that in the culture of their society. These so-called films are a very expensive overhead and total drain (mental, moral, and financial) on entire real physical economy, and such corrupting non-industry demands that its minions remain absolute controlled doltish fools who crave, and feed, it's less than uselessness perpetually. Rather than support those monsters feed your mind/soul, and certainly never wait upon such ignorance, or worse, by paying for it!"
" Jew and Israel hating focus ruins this film
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,1,"The opening scene is promising. It's a group of criminals that you find out are police officers are plotting to commit a difficult armed robbery. They decide that in spite of the odds they will go through with the plan. And what you eventually find out is that this film is just all about a group of characters who must obtain a McGuffin, no more no less.We then meet the woman who is calling the shots. The gritty film becomes laughable from there. Kate Winslet, looking nasty and wearing a gold Star of David pendant at least as large as a hockey puck is introduced, right after her two non-speaking thugs with cool haircuts and huge skull cap yarmulkas escort our black protagonist into the house. His half black son is being raised Jewish and also has a huge skull cap yarmulka on his head. Apparently all of this Russian mob also is connected with Israel. What did this have to do with the movie at all? At that point I could only wonder whether the film received financing from a middle east arab country or someone with a HUGE ax to grind with religious Jewish people and Israel. And that theme continues throughout the movie and right up front.There is nothing new as you move along. It's the same heavy handed message that there is no honor among thieves and criminals. I won't give away the ending. It's no big reveal you'll guess part of the explosive climax which doesn't make much sense if the characters are consistent with how they are presented. This is such a colossal waste of talent. A cast whose names are on some of the most well known and revered films of the past decade and the end result will only be memorable for how far out of the way the director goes to remind everyone that the most horrible criminal animals in this film are these reviled religious Jewish Israeli mobsters. Forgettable rubbish."
" Someone here clearly hates religious Jews, not fond of Hispanics either
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,1,"For reasons unexplained, there was a decision to create some bizarre, totally out of place, religious Jewish Russian mafia. Having worked with some of them during my day job, the depiction of these Jewish villains was so pitiful bad that it immediately removed me from the movie. It could have been decent if pains weren't made to create such an artificial and unbelievable gang, complete with Yarmulkas. And then there is the denigration of blacks by these Jews and more I won't describe.Great cast. Strange story that is not believable, straight from the opening. A film has to be plausible in order to be accepted by the audience. But how would anyone believe the opening scene and the repercussions of greed which didn't translate into an immediate problem? This film doesn't even bother with making sure that those covering up a crime *wear gloves* when committing crimes in places they shouldn't be.The depiction of Hispanic people in Atlanta was also hilariously way over the top. Religious Jews are disgusting, disgraceful, racist people and Hispanics are all a bunch of ego driven mindless dumb thugs. Whomever was responsible for this mess and clearly anti-Semitic priority should have been tarred and feathered for wasting a good cast of actors. They should have paid more attention to tightening up a very loose script instead of creating even more outrageous stereotypes."
" A waste of talent for a bad story
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,5,You would think that a movie with such a cast could only be good. But in Triple 9 talented actors are the proof it's not a guarantee you will have a good movie all the time. It starts good though with the bank robbery but afterwards the story is kinda boring and way too long. Plus the story should have had more explanations but even with that I don't know if it would have helped making it more interesting. There is plenty of action though but most of the time I was just bored with the movie. When I saw the cast I had high hopes but at the end it's just not good enough. Now there are worse movies then Triple 9 but if I was you I wouldn't waste my time on this one and just look for something better. Disappointing movie night.
" Ruined by the disjointed storyline
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,5,"Sometimes a movie that starts off with lots of disjointed scenes can have real punch as you piece together the snippets of story - it can be quite satisfying as things drop into place and the story becomes fully coherent. Sadly this movie jumps from scene to scene and that disjointed feeling lasts until the end. There is a story and there is some sense to it but it just doesn't gel as a movie.The police are depicted as bumbling, incompetent and corrupt but this is so exaggerated (I hope!) that it means there is no sense of realism whatsoever. The movie doesn't build empathy with any of the characters or even tell you much about them, in any case virtually all of them are unpleasant, so I was left not really caring what happened to any of them. OK to watch if you don't expect too much depth."
" Not bad, but missing something
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,6,"TRIPLE 9 is another thriller from Australian director John Hillcoat, who previously made the excellent THE PROPOSITION and the watchable LAWLESS. This one's a contemporary crime flick about a gang of robbers who steal stuff for the Russian mafia, and it's one of those twisty-turny type stories with a lot of complexity to make it watchable too. Unfortunately it's not quite the masterpiece that the director or the trailer would have you believe.The film starts off on a strong footing with an excellently-staged heist scene; this is the best part of the film and sees Hillcoat at the top of his game. Norman Reedus is a welcome addition to the cast and steals all of his scenes early on. Unfortunately, the film then slips into low gear and doesn't really come back until the ending. A second robbery is agreed on early enough, but it takes an hour for this robbery to go into motion, and there's a lot of extraneous stuff where not much happens.The script really struggles to craft likable characters and Casey Affleck is about the only one here that the viewer even halfway likes. Anthony Mackie and Chiwetel Ejiofor have very little to work with and are quite repellent in their parts. Woody Harrelson goes too far with the tics and mannerisms and feels like a walking caricature, while Kate Winslet is simply miscast as the supposedly imposing villain of the piece. Aaron Paul is pretty good although has too little screen time, while Michael Kenneth Williams has a delightful cameo."
