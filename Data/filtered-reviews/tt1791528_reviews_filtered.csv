" Wanted to like it...but the plot is nonsense
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,6,"This movie could've been great, like Thomas Pynchon's novel of the same name. For the first ten minutes of the film, it certainly appears that it is going to be a great film.But the plot just completely breaks down as the film goes on and stops making any sense at all.At some point the characters you're meeting (quirky and interesting as they are) no longer matter because the plot connecting them together in a significant way almost completely disappears.By the end I was confused about who half the people we met were or why they mattered at all to the story. Joaquin Pheonix and Josh Brolin were great, but overall this film was disappointing from a storytelling perspective. I still don't understand at all what Josh Brolin's character was trying to achieve by the end..."
" Fantastic movie.
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,10,Great cast. Just over the top enough to keep things interesting and full of charm.
" The Anderson film I suspect I will most want to revisit in the future
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,10,"After the critical and commercial success of the rather serious The Master, director Paul Thomas Anderson decided to follow it up with a rather more humorous film, in the shape of his 2014 adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's Inherent Vice. Set in 1970s Los Angeles, the film - like the novel - follows a stoner private detective as investigates an increasingly broadening case. Partly influenced by film noir and partly - according to Anderson - by Cheech and Chong, the resulting movie is fiendish clever and blisteringly funny at the same time.
Like The Master, Inherent Vice stars Joaquin Phoenix, this time as perpetually stoned private eye Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, who is asked by his ex-girlfriend to help him stop her boyfriend Michael Wolfman's ex-wife and her lover having Wolfman committed to a lunatic asylum. As he follows an increasingly convoluted trail, he encounters a wide variety of eccentric characters, including a devious brothel Madame, a psychotic police detective, and a cult run by dentists turned heroin dealers. In the process, he also encounters physical comedy, slapstick violence, and a whole host of witty lines.
Phoenix, not unusually, is brilliant as Doc, immersing himself in the role so completely that one wonders if he spent the entire shoot stoned. Anderson, as in many of his films, assembles an ensemble cast brimming with familiar faces including Eric Roberts, Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon and Martin Short, and they all give pitch-perfect performances in their often small but important roles. Benicio del Toro meanwhile is hilarious as Doc's attorney Sauncho Smilax, capturing something of his performance as Dr. Gonzo back in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, whilst Josh Brolin is terrifyingly convincing as the uptight, Hippy-hating detective ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen.
Anderson wrote the screenplay himself based on Pynchon's novel and did so largely faithfully, although the ending is altered and he turns the character of Sortilège into an unseen narrator (huskily voiced by harpist Joanna Newsom) in order to retain some of Pynchon's prose and to aid the transition from novel to film. Anderson's talent for writing is often overshadowed by his reputation as a director, but the two are fundamentally interconnected: the fact that Anderson writes to his strengths as a director produces a clarity of vision that is undoubtedly a key reason for his success. And so he brings to life his screenplay partly by assembling a handpicked cast, but also ensuring that the mise-en-scéne realises the world he seeks to create, in this case 1970s Los Angeles, the illusion of which is perfectly conjured by the sets and California location filming. As usual in his films, Anderson makes extensive use of highly dynamic camerawork courtesy of his regular cinematographer Robert Elswit and all manner of interesting shots to make the film visually striking - it is immediately recognisable as a P.T. Anderson film due to its distinctive style. The influence of film noir is evident in his use of light and shadow. Additionally, Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead fame composes his third soundtrack for an Anderson film and one which also invokes the era perfectly.
This is a film that blends Pynchon's and Anderson's talents to make a rich, complex, mischievous and very, very funny film, which has a hint of the aforementioned Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and a touch of The Big Lebowski about it, and like those films is like to become a cult favourite. Eminently quotable, one suspects that it will lend well itself to repeat viewings; for all of the plaudits heaped on There Will Be Blood and The Master, Inherent Vice is the Anderson film I suspect I will most want to revisit in the future."
" Slow, messy, and still funny
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,6,"The Lebowski vibes are strong with this one - a dramatic director dipping into film noir with a stoner protagonist. It is a giant departure for PTA...but still feels pretty PTA-ish. There's a willingness to let the humor and ridiculousness sit for a moment. Usually he's giving dramatic scenes the space to breathe, giving the tension time to escalate. In this case, he's letting the silliness set in. The lingering shots of Doc's ""notes"" was one of the funniest bits I have seen in a long time. Still, the plot's a little messy and slow to reveal itself. This is not Anderson's best, but it is entertaining nonetheless."
" The vice of keeping it too long
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,7,"I'll be straight: this feels like an ''Andersonian'' movie, not like PTA's movie. The cinematography, the soundtracks and the character-driven world reminded me that this is indeed PTA's movie. But its flaws, its numerous plot-holes, its too-long scenes or unnecessary dialogue combined with the hardly bearable length and failure to make us empathize more with the characters (in comparison to other PTA's characters) diminished the effect and pleasure of watching this movie for me.I understand his comedic touch, sometimes it made me laugh, other times just smile or cringe at the sight of a failed but nice try. It had some beautiful scenes and witty dialogue that succeeded to maintain my interest for a while. In my humble opinion, they should have cut 30-40 minutes from the movie and it would have made it a lot more watchable.A 7.25 from 10."
" Many words thrown into the void.
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,4,"I didn't understand the first hour of the film. I was told it looked like Under the Silve Lake, and not only doesn't it look, but it's really bad."
" A spellbinding mess
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,1,"You know a pretentious film within minutes... and, as is often the case, they are all style and no substance.Inherent Vice is exactly that, as a needless voice-over tries to sound poetic while either saying nothing or telling us what we've just seen. Every shot is pretty, the actors are all on form, but their dialogue is almost incomprehensible, with an overly-convoluted plot that, were it not so, would be B-grade detective material.I managed just over 40 minutes of this spellbinding mess before I my logical mind yelled at me the benefits of an early night!
Honestly, by missing this, you are missing nothing except the feeling that you're wasting your time by watching it.Verdict: an absolute stinker to avoid!"
" Felt like an incomprehensible inside joke
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,4,"PTA is one of the most talented directors working today, if not of all time. Unfortunately, Inherent Vice is the only movie of his that I just don't understand. Or rather I don't understand why he and other people think this is a good story. I understand the ideas behind it being a love letter to a bygone era that also serves as a noir parody with wacky characters. What I don't understand is why this way of telling the story got so much acclaim. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a great example of a film with little plot that gets by on the strength of the characters and manages to invoke feelings of nostalgia for an era which I never experienced. Inherent Vice isn't able to do that and its characters whilst sometimes amusing become grating as the dialogue and situations become increasingly puzzling. Finally, the jokes just aren't funny to me, apart from a few brief instances. The movie as a whole reminded me of Altman's The Long Goodbye which was yet another movie that I just couldn't understand. Both of them feel like inside jokes that I tried to be a part of as I scratched my head in confusion trying to figure out what the hell is going on. And maybe that's my problem, maybe I should've gone with the flow and embraced the weirdness. But most likely it's just not a style that will ever appeal to me and I will never fully comprehend the appeal of this film, even if I read a thousand explanations."
" A great start that ends with a lacklustre affair
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,6,"I had alot of goodwill towards this as it started out as a nicely vibed doped up 70s sequel of sorts to The Big Lebowski with Doc only missing the White Russian in his hand as he moves through situations and characters of increasing complexity and bafflement.This changed an hour in when Bigfoot says, ""remind me why i give a s**t"" and that summed up my thoughts concisely toward the film by this point and unfortunately with over an hour still to run it didnt get any better. The laughs dried up and all interest in any of the myriad of characters including the main protagonist left the building.I feel this is a real shame since there is a cracking 90-120 min film in there somewhere just needed trimming like your mans hair."
" Surprisingly Bad
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,2,Unsatisfying and weak. Well-acted but poorly written.
" A stylish, bizarre, beautiful, colorful odyssey that takes you all through the 70s.
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,10,"Paul Thomas Anderson brings back another breathtaking masterpiece to the big screen, which involves an amazing cast and an incredible script.
.
Gotta tell you, I wasn't expecting much from this movie. But when got to the 10th minute, I knew it was going to be crazy. A stylish, bizarre, beautiful, colorful odyssey that takes you all through the 70s. I'm not afraid to say that is one of the bests from the 10s.
I felt a lot of things with this one and believe me, don't listen to the critics. If you wanna experience a movie that takes you really deep into the beginning of the 70s, this is your chance."
" An Honest Review
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,10,"I kind of feel that Anderson lends himself to a film like this. He uses a lot of extreme wide angles and if you ever smoked a little dope in college the world looks a little like when you mount that 18mm on your SLR. His choice of lenses lends itself to telling the story of a guy like Doc without going over the top ala Fear and Loathing and making it a little too blatantly FX.The humor works in best possible dry as a martini kind of way, and it's played straight like comedy should be.But really, the premise sold me. Take a hard boiled film noir kind of mystery and replace Sam Spade with the perpetual stoner and then watch him try to solve a mystery.It's incoherent enough to make you believe that Doc is just a little too rocked to function properly most of the time, which is reflected in his effectiveness and decision making skills. He's smart enough to not bumble his way through it, but has gotten off the magic school bus enough to do his best possible work.And it makes the film do that one singular thing that all movies are required to do in order to be called a success... it entertains.And honestly it's a delight to watch. The acting was great, the director was the best possible person to take on the adaptation, and the lighting walked that fine line between naturalistic and cinematic.I'd call it a beautiful film, but it's hard to call a movie about drugs beautiful without sounding utterly pretentious... so, I'll settle with the highest praise a movie can get... it's entertaining and a pleasure to watch."
" Sorry but I don't get it
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,5,"I know, I know, it's a film you're meant to watch more than once, but to be perfectly honest, I have absolutely zero inclination to do so because it was just so boring to me.Like, what am I missing here? It's a by-the-numbers crime thriller that's occasionally funny, and has good performances and a decent soundtrack, but other than that there's nothing special about it whatsoever, and the plot's convoluted and confusing as hell to boot.This is the only PTA film I've seen so far, so I'll no doubt come back to it one day once I've seen a few more, but for now...I mean I certainly hope it's his worst one."
" Doc...
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,7,"""Inherent Vice"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a private investigator investigating the disappearance of his ex-girlfriend after visiting him in order to propose him a crazy idea to make them both very rich.I liked this movie because it had an interesting plot, a good direction which was made by Paul Thomas Anderson who is also one of the writers and some very interestingly different interpretations made by its cast. Joaquin Phoenix who played as Larry ""Doc"" Sportello made an excellent interpretation along with Josh Brolin who played as Lt. Det. Christian F. ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen. Finally, I have to say that ""Inherent Vice"" is a very different movie in which you have to stay focused in order to keep up with its story and its plot."
" Pynchon made visible
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,10,"While we are waiting for the film version of ""Gravity's Rainbow"", this is contact-high inducing, engrossing, complex, gritty image of LA, cops, hippies, money, California sunset, with great lines barely audible, an unforgettable sex scene; Tarantino with the volume turned down and the moral subtlety turned up. ""LSD opens the door; PCP opens the door, kicks you through it, locks the door behind you and throws away the key."""
" Flying high on movie science and art.
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,9,"One sunny day at dawn, I would say more.

Magnificent work of narrator, Vey insightful on the simple things, were devil is known to move on...Congratulations, explender of cinema, even for the most weird and informed.One epoch with a n especial nostalgia envolved...
Doesn't come back, but it happened one day...."
" Requires attention.
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,8,"I really digged into it on this fourth attempt of actually watching it till the end - finally, it happened, I did it.
This is PTA's most distinguished film, it is challenging with its off putting tone, yet seductive with its witty dialogue and colourful cinematography.
PTA got an Oscar nod for best screenplay with this one and although I love the man, I don't think it deserved it. Sure the mystery is very well wrapped up, but he could have done much better with the characters. At some moments the characters felt like Wes Anderson's characters. I don't know, maybe I'm missing something. It was really great to see some of my most favourite actors gathered together, which again it reminds me of Wes's films, with its impressive casts. And just like in Wes's films, the actors couldn't really shine.
Overall, I really liked it. PTA went a bit different this time comparing to his other work and it didn't disappointed. Oh and I dropped dead laughing when Doc says: You're the one that has been stealing my magazines? 😜"
" Inherent vice...
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,9,"Inherent vice is a blackly comic, engaging whodunnit with a game talented cast and a superb central performance makes this movie a must watch. To summarise the plot will be an understatement cause the basic story line in incomprehensible and its very hard to decipher . But still the movie works cause the details and the ambiguous symbolism holds you till the end. The cinematography and editing really makes us feel that we are in the 60s and 70s world. The grainy aesthetic is the cherry on the cake. The plot while inaccessible still has a immense level of intricate details that will melt your brain. Is it a normal disaaperance case or a bigger conspiracy about drugs, capitalist illegal houses business, about racism or about hippe culture. It is a culmination of all the themes and that is astounding to watch it is not easy follow but still you are hooked like you are solving the puzzle. Joaquin phoenix nailed the hippie aesthetic of the character, and you feel like he is actually a stoner masterfull performance. Josh brolin is weirdly funny. Benicio del toro, Reese Witherspoon, katherine waterston, Owen Wilson each and every person drives the plot together. Ultimately it is a headsmacking film but a sometimes not knowing anything is actually the biggest hint of the movies we watch. Paul Thomas Anderson nailed another film."
" BIG FAILURE
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,5,"Worst film of Paul Thomas Anderson.
Totally nonsense and boring.
Lost in translation..."
" Impossible to follow, out of the question engage with it.
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,4,"I was not able to finish the movie. It´s not possible to follow the plot, too many characters, to many names, bizarre scenes connected with.... nothing? with something that will come? To enjoy a movie you need to step in the story, believe in the characters, build your own plot. However, in this movie, and after one hour trying to not disconnect, you're mad with yourselve because you are completely lost and with no hopes.Why waste peoples' time with such a long movie? No one could have warned the director of the nonsense he was releasing? There are someone in the crew who watched the movie? I'm really pissed off with the movie."
" Basically a Masterpiece
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"Watched this yesterday, not out of choice, but because another member of our small but perfectly formed COVID 19 self-isolation team called his right to choose a film. I get a little nervous at the mention of Paul Thomas Anderson's name (entirely down to my unforgivable tendency to confuse him with another, rather more pretentious/ less interesting Anderson), but the minute the film opened on that narrow passage in between two beach houses, I was whoosh! - meaning hooked. This is a film where story doesn't really matter, and yet the narrative still so seamlessly, mesmerisingly exist you could just sit there and ride that wave till cows come home or Doc finally solves the case. Which case, you ask... So, then, congratulations to Paul Thomas Anderson for his entirely unexpected contribution to my Top 10 films ever. All is forgiven, and I hope it's mutual."
" Don't feel stupid if you don't understand it. Feel stupid if you don't try to!
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"As a new person to Paul Thomas Anderson movies since this is the second one that I've watched from him (the first was the amazing There Will be Blood), I'm starting to fall in love with his movie style.I've read some other reviews, and a lot of people rate this movie has bad because of its confusing storyline, and to be honest they are fairly right. What I don't understand is, how they consider movies like Mulholland Drive, or even Pulp Fiction (in a less dramatic saying obviously) has argumentative masterpieces in terms of new ways to present a scrip to the audience. And this are movies where the directors do this because they want to, on a way to give the audience a far more interesting and personal experience, but in the end, it's the director choice. On the other hand in Inherent Vice what happens, and the reason of why the story is so confusing its because we are actually watching the unwinding of a case in the mind of the stoner Private Investigator, ""Doc"" (Joaquin Phoenix) , deeply sunk in what should be a simple little problem that his ex-girlfriend, Shasta (Katherine Waterson) was involved.Now putting aside, the deep and confusing storyline, and jumping to the characters, every role in this movie is presented in truly astonishing way. As almost everything is in this film, some are very hard to follow, and to understand from where the hell they came out, but after a while, they all begin to connect and you start understanding that just like in Tarantino's iconic Pulp Fiction, all characters are related by some sort of coincidence (or deal, or crime, etc), and this story, although mainly focusing on Doc, is also a group of other small stories that are also connected. As every good movie about the 60's and 70's, this one respects the slang and the style of talking used this period, sometimes making it, again, hard to follow. Furthermore, a very interesting factor about the characters, is how they all seem to come together to show how the hippie idealistic ""peaceful world"", a 60's symbol, was destroyed by the greed of human nature, and the capitalism created by it. It also shows how some true believers of the hippie cause, like Doc, survived because they never got in the useless, need-buy cycle created by the capitalism (I'm not saying I agree with this, and I don't want to get all political, but in my point of view this was a critic by the director and a very well made one, that I think it's important to mention).The movie is beautifully shot, and the partnership between PTA and the Oscar winner cinematographer Robert Elswit, works yet again (Robert Elswit's Oscar win was actually working for PTA in There Will Be Blood). The movie also has a very good soundtrack made by Jonny Greenwood, who previously worked with PTA in two other projects. All the actors give very good and credible performances, with emphasize on the great Joaquin Phoenix who once again does a brilliant job, but also Josh Brolin, ""Lt. Bigfoot"", who has some of the funniest shots but also serious lines in the movie.In conclusion, this film is not as bad as everyone say it is, this is actually a great movie, the problem is: some people are just to lazy to try and understand it. This is not a film to watch once and go to sleep. This is one to watch, try to understand it, and just like in a case, try to solve every bit of it that there is to solve. Every word, every distorted reality from a pothead mind like ""Doc"", every weird character connection... Seriously hope you watch this movie, and if you do, when you get to the end don't feel stupid because you didn't understand it, only feel stupid if you don't try to understand it. That's the whole point of the trip!"
" more like a book than a movie
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,4,"Incoherent and though to follow movie, which feels more like reading a book than watching a movie. There are lot of parts of movie, yet they arent fully ulitlised and dont tightly fit together."

" Confusing.
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,5,"So whats up is I have to go back to this again to find what so talking about it. Initially, I'm just in the back of the arena where the subject is so confusing and it goes in slow, steady mode. I am not able to grasp what the characters are talking about and what's the initiative of Doc. I feel confused about the narration also. Inherent Vice put me into a vacuum and I believe a second watch will put me out from it. That why rate it half out of the whole."

I really appreciate the camerawork, lots of long shots, take advantage of the actors and the location well
Consistently good acting
Pretty setsCons:
Tough to follow, never have an idea if the current scene is important to the plot
No great characters aside from the protagonist
Quite a number of uninteresting sideplots, probably because I never know the stakes, like what is Doc risking by talking to these strangersBest part: Bigfoot eating all that weed
Worst part: Shasta sideplot conclusion"
" Much funnier than I thought it would be
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,7,"I was not really expecting how funny this movie was. I remembered the trailer, especially the shot where Joaquin Phoenix gets shouldered so hard by a cop that he flies nearly off screen, but it ended up being funnier the way it was presented in the movie.From the very first lines of dialogue, Doc, our hero, is in way over his head. His former hippie ex-girlfriend shows up and asks him to investigate a real estate mogul, his wife, and a plot to have him committed to a loony bin. It's obvious from that start, that Doc is never going to catch up with the plot in any meaningful way.What's interesting is that Doc spends almost the entire movie following a trail of breadcrumbs without ever actually doing anything himself or witnessing anything. It's a noir where the ""hero"" always shows up too late and everyone around him does everything just to fill him in on it later. Considering the level of drug use in the film, that seems to be a deliberate choice. Doc cannot catch up because he has trouble deciphering reality from his own drug-fueled haze. There are moments that seem to suggest that Doc talks to people who aren't there.After two hours, we finally get what could be called a character action, and it almost ends up feeling incidental. Doc shows up at the office of a guy who's constantly almost in and then out of prison (being some kind of enforcer and police informant at the same time). Doc knows he needs to be there because he's there, but when he gets asked why he's there he can't explain it. It's only when the big Aryan Brother with the swastika tattooed on his face walks into the room that a wave of realization comes over him about why he might be there, and by then it's too late. We've seen this guy here and there, always on his tail having some connection to the disappearance to the real estate mogul and the murder that Doc gets framed for (poorly) at the beginning of the film.Falling in with the idea that everyone knows what's going on except Doc, the Aryan ties up Doc with the implicit threat of torture and death. This kicks Doc out of his laconic mood to the point where he actually fights back. It's not in service to the plot that Doc suddenly becomes a player, it's in the service of his own survival.Throughout the film, Doc has several interactions with Bigfoot, a police detective who's trying to follow some of the same leads as Doc. The two are mirror images of each other. Doc the rudderless hippie versus Bigfoot the crewcut cop. They cross paths, exchange information, and steadily grow more similar as Doc grows a bit from the situation and Bigfoot gets further and further humiliated, falling further and further behind in the plot as they go. Because the plot of the film actually doesn't matter though, Bigfoot is putting great importance on something that doesn't matter leading him to busting down Doc's door and eating a pile of Doc's weed.I think that this is a movie that will grow with me over time. I had a good idea of what I was getting into going in. I knew that there was little to no action, that it was long, and that it was drug-fueled. That mostly prepared me for the film, but the miasma on top kept my focus a bit more than the underlying ideas, and I think more viewings will get me to appreciate those more. As it stands, though, I was able to laugh consistently through the film.A note on that, to bring this all together from the beginning. That shot of Doc flying from the shoulder by the cop in the trailer is played straight there. Normal sound effects and dialogue. In the film, the sound has dropped off and we hear the laconic female voice over waxing a certain poetic tone about Doc's situation and mindset. As we hear that, we watch the tone shatter with the shoulder, but the voice over makes no mention of what happened on screen and simply continue. It's a really funny juxtaposition of sound and sight, the sort of humor that pervades the film."
" A trip... a literal trip, but we're all lost, including the director
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,5,"2hours20minutes and I don't know what the movie was supposed to be about... It's almost like the director tried to do this movie 'Tarantino style' yet he failed miserably. 95% of the time you don't know what's going on, and the other 5% you're trying to not fall asleep, because everybody in this movie talks SO DAMN SLOW! At the end, there's SO many things left unexplained... like I'm sitting here, wondering what happened to at least 4 different characters... what happened to them in the end? Why don't we get some kind of a resolution for those characters? It's just a massive mystery, that YOU YOURSELF have to be a P.I. to investigate it seems."
" Another cult classic favorite of mine!
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,8,"I just recently discovered this film a few weeks ago, and... Wow! I had just seen Joker(which I instantly fell in love with)that time and wanted to look up more of his films I had overlooked in the past and when I came across this I had absolutely 0 idea what it was, so I checked it out for curiosity sake... and boy am I glad! This film really spoke to me on a personal level. Yeah the overall story/plot is nearly impossible to understand and keep up with, but honestly it's everything else about it that I couldn't turn away from; the atmosphere, theme, characters and dialogue! The best way I can describe it: hypnotic and puts you in a sort of state of high! The main character played by the man himself is pretty much me in real life, his style, groove and how he overall presents himself and gets treated by those that don't really approve of his type. After watching this movie a couple of times, it's already in my top 20 favorite movies of all time. A true gem for someone like me (definitely probably not for everyone though, so unfortunately I'm not surprised that it bombed at the box office and nobody has really talked about it😅😭)"
" Inherent Vice- Amazing Cluelessness
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,8,"Inherent Vice is so odd and different, but also so well Directed and Acted at the same time. Coming off of ""The Master"" PTA and Joaquin Phoenix are as great as ever. The only negative I have of the film is Josh Brolin's character Arc, especially at the end. But there is no Film Like Inherent Vice. 8/10"

It will be total waste of your time... Do anything else, but watch this stupidity. Yes,even main character, Joaquin Phoenix looks uncomfortable acting in this mess..."
" Its impossible to criticize this movie
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,5,"We can't criticize the incomprehensible nature of the movie because it was intentionally written that way to capture the tone of the novel. Eventhough I personally couldn't enjoy this movie, I completely understand why other people like it. I understand what they were going for but I couldn't connect with it personally. All the performances, especially by Phoenix and Brolin were top notch. Both those characters were written extremely well. There were some genuinely funny sequences too. However there are several instances where Doc relies on coincidences and conveniences to uncover the cases. This aspect felt like lazy writing.
I don't dislike this movie but I can't like it either. I have such a complicated opinion on this movie. PTA is one of the best directors working today. But I couldn't appreciate this movie like I did with his other movies like The Master, There will be blood etc."
" I don't know what to think
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,6,"Seen this movie without knowing anything about it but I thought I'd give it a try.
The characters of the show are more or less all quite interesting and well acted. Especially Joaquin Phoenix and Katherine Waterston did a very good job and of course a little Benicio del Toro is always nice to watch. But oh boy the plot of this movie was so weird and hard to follow that at the end of the movie I felt like I missed most of it even though I payed attention. I felt like there were too many names and characters that left an open spot in the plot. I mean watching the characters was entertaining for the most parts but understanding them was impossible to me.
I don't really have an opinion on this one. I enjoyed watching it but I don't feel like I would've missed out something if I hadn't seen it."
" A lazy chill movie about nothing
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,6,"You definitely have to be in the right mood for this movie. It's basically just random meandering following a dazed stoner.Phoenix has a great performance, and the movie as a whole is well directed. Costume design is on point, soundtrack is good. The movie is funny, but not hilarious.Overall it's basically just a chill hangout movie. Not much more to it than that. It's meant to just relax and enjoy. Probably a good movie to watch in the background while hungover."
" Complex, yet easily followed and stylishly substantial
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Joaquin Phoenix emerges from his professional hiatus in this groovy drug-fuelled crime caper by Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, There Will be Blood).Unconventional private investigator 'Doc' (Phoenix) is dragged into a sordid kidnapping and extortion plot via a soft spot for his troubled ex-girlfriend. Doc's well-placed friends in marine law (fantastic cameo by Benicio del Toro) and the district attorney's office (a surprising appearance by Reese Witherspoon) get him out of some sticky spots and help piece together what's up with his ex's boyfriend, his wife and her lover.Yet another A-list bit-part went to Owen Wilson as the 'disappeared' husband of an old friend whose fate inadvertently helps to reveal the double, triple and quadruple crossing at the highest levels in 1970's California, but it turns out Doc is more connected than he imagined and may know more than he thought.Narrated from on high by a celestially connected mutual friend of Doc and his lost soulmate, Inherent Vice takes you on a neon-lit psychedelic ride, leaving you at once wondering if you understood anything at all yet feeling as though everything played out as it should have.
It's complex yet easily followed and stylishly substantial.
If only the Academy didn't have such a 'thing' against Phoenix-he'd be a front-runner at next month's Oscars."
" Good cast. Weird movie.
",2019-07-11 00:00:00,10,"Holy stuff!! This is a weird one. Long too. Pretty simple plot but still becomes somewhat complex to follow, but not overly so. It's messy and even a bit suralistic at times, that makes it hard to focus on the actual plot, and I belive that is intended. But if you manage, the plot is actually not that complex as it's seems, it's actually kind of straight forward.Joaquin Phoenix plays a private investigator, called ""Doc"", that moves about in L.A during the hippie scene in the 60/70s, probably 70s. He is a pot smoker and somewhat known loser around town. He is using his contacts, people skill and wits, to solve a case about a missing billionaire and the case also involves a ex girlfriend, so it has personal value to him. This chase takes him on a ride and we as the viewers as well. And it's kind of a weird messy and sometimes hilarious ride in a 2:26 hour run time, with drug use as a theme. This movie is hard to put in a gener but if I would try, I'd say a crime/drug/comedy, it's not your average movie, not at all. I can see if many turn this off somewhere in the first 3rd, I would fully understand, because this movie can really awaken the feeling ""what the heck am I watching?"" You wonder what is going on, what's the point, why was this made, who wrote this, what were they thinking?
Hard to tell. It's probably about preference. If you enjoy Big Lebowski or Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, you might like this one. Even though this will probably never be viewed as a classic in the same way those two films has.Well, to my personal opinion. I absolutely loved this! Even if I had to paus it two times, beacuse it was kind of losing me watching it late at night. But I paused it beacuse I didn't want this to happen, I really wanted to view it taking in as much as I could, so I paused for a bit an regained my focus on the film.
What did this movie give me? Over all, it was entertaining, even if a bit slow at times, but even more so, it was an expirence, a fun ride with quorki characters in a warm likeable setting, but still with some unsettledness to it also, realistic but still unrealistic. And Joaquin Phoenix is great in it, the character he creates is uniq, and in a subtle way, he's using body language, his eyes, tone of voice and off course dialoug, to create this almost timeless philosophical persona of a somewhat cartoonish character, which to me was really likeable. And it's a good cast overall. The movie has this atmosphere that gave me a good feeling. It's worth one watch at least. To me, it's actually a full score. I just loved this movie, I don't really know why, just did."
" The name of the movie tells it all
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,4,"Maybe it is the too many movies I have watched, but this was such a deja vu and cliché that was nerve breaking watching it till the end only to be sure my opinion after the first 10 minutes was not mistaken. If it was not for the great cast this would have been a total wast of time. It is hard to believe that the Academy has nominated it for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay! With such an ""inherent vice"" scenario there is no acting that can have saved this from being boring from the start to the happy end!"
" Too long and no plot
",2019-06-19 00:00:00,3,"I was expecting to see something worth my time, because it is Paul Thomas Anderson's work, but noooo. I tried to understand what is its plot, but during watching my interest has fallen. However, there are also many good actors and actresses, but unfortunately it came up that it is empty. It's going too long and I hardly endured till the end."
" Psychedelic Ride
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,7,"Anderson creates one of the most zany mysteries on film. Great direction, screenplay, setting, soundtrack, editing and acting. The entire cast delivers pitch perfect offbeat performances. Phoenix, Wilson, Brolin and Waterson offer brilliant and sometimes subtle comedic portrayals. Set in 1970's California, the plot revolves around a private detective who does everything, including his work, stoned. When his former lover suddenly appears with a case involving the disappearance of her current boyfriend and his wife, the journey begins. The detective is on the case and must navigate a substance fueled land of surfers, police officers and stoners. The plot is unique, strange, bizarre and outlandish. It's a one of a kind film for it's genre. If you can sit back and enjoy it for the entertainment value, it is a fun joy ride."
" Rockford Files through the Looking Glass
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the funniest and entertaining movies from 2014 that was made during this time period. The supporting cast and the writing of the movie is really interesting. It may be a little confusing at times but that's part of its allure .
Josh Brolin, Martin Short, and Owen Wilson and Katherine Waterston just some of the great talent that contributes to the success of this movie. It contains content that parents may find objectionable for young people , it's rated ""R""."
" Neither Here Noir There
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,1,"Judging by appearances alone, INHERENT VICE has already been compared to THE BIG LEBOWSKI since our scruffy hippie hero is... well... a scruffy hippie hero, like Jeff Bridges as The Dude. But the real similarity is both channel Film Noir where reluctant underdogs become entangled in an eclectic web of deceit, beautiful women, red herrings and more last names than a phone book...And while LEBOWSKI centered on the product of the 1960's lost in the 1990's, INHERENT VICE takes us to that actual magical place: a colorful era where idealistic L.A. druggies proudly contrast from the straight-laced necktie jerks, who, in this particular case, are all more crooked than Richard Nixon himself (numerously mentioned along with The Manson Family, Paranoia, Blacklisting and a nap-sack of other counter-culture clichés).The problem with VICE isn't the abundance of characters spouting endless monologues within dull interior locations, but our main man, Joaquin Phoenix, whose Larry ""Doc"" Sportello doesn't seem established enough to be taken seriously as an investigator of any sort, or a doctor or... Whatever the hell he's supposed to be just isn't clear.Phoenix sleepwalks through the role without humor, pathos or legitimate world-weary dynamic while his given-task weaves in so many twists and turns, there's no palpable destination. Being misled through a foggy treadmill maze is the staple of any gumshoe flick, but a light at the end of the tunnel, or a few sparks along the way, keeps the viewer intrigued, enlightened, and awake. Meanwhile, epic art house director Paul Thomas Anderson seems even more absent than his otherwise talented MASTER star.The best character is Josh Brolin's square-jawed flattop bully cop Bigfoot, who represents everything hippies thoroughly detest: Ironically enough, he has one thing the entire movie lacks, which can be summed up in three words: An... Actual... Pulse."

Be warned though that if you are not familiar with Mr. Pynchon's work, it will take several viewings to really appreciate and understand the plot. I am glad that much of the original prose has been preserved because it is so poignant at times. Keep a sense of humor about it and give this film a chance."
" Bad, really bad
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,1,"1970 - Los Angeles: Joaquin Phoenix plays a private detective who is also a hippy. He gets involved in various situations that are subplots which are apparently related to each other.Many of the characters in this film are stoned on drugs. I wondered if the viewer had to be in the same situation in order to understand this movie. Even after reading the Wikipedia synopsis, I was still confused.A few scenes are interesting and the performances are all fine. But even if this two-and-a-half hour movie were reduced by at least a full hour (which it should have been), it might have had the possibility of throwing out the unnecessary and indulgent ""filler"" and given the (not stoned) viewer a tiny chance of putting the pieces together or maybe to understand why the hell the main character keeps getting himself into really stupid and dangerous situations. For that matter, it was hard to understand why the hell any of the other characters were doing whatever the hell they were doing as well.Maybe, one has to live in Los Angeles to ""get it"". Well, to each their own but this was a terrible disappointment especially considering it was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson who has made such fine films before especially ""There Will Be Blood"" (2007)."
" ""Under the paving stones, the beach!"" Paris, 1968.
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,9,"When supporting actor Josh Brolin mentioned in interviews that he himself didnt understand what the story was about, then you cant say you havent been warned about the vagueness of this plot. Vagueness, confusion and suggestions going nowhere are abound in this story, up to a point that not knowing where the story will go becomes the main focus by itself. But this confusion is as enjoyable as I have ever been confused, by not understanding what the story is all about.With this story we descend into the deepest and weirdest thoughts of the doped out mind of Joaquin Phoenix, who is a private investigator in the sixties, investigating something, and while doing that he meets a lot of other mysterious doped out people, having mindblowingly vague dialogues. Joaquin Phoenix steals the show with his hippie impersonation. He is THE DUDE! For any fan of his work, this is a must see, even if you dont like the movie's plot.This movie can be best enjoyed as if one were on a pot induced kind of trip. Director Paul Thomas Anderson, like no other American director has got the talent to confuse, distort and question things. It is a real gift to leave the cinema with more questions than one had during the start. It is as if ""Inherent Vice"" gave me a dope trip, with only silver screen visuals as the ingredients which got me high.If you like to be dazed and confused as well, this is one of the best visual silver screen trips I can think of...""Under the paving stones, the beach!""

Unless yours is Katherine or Paul Thomas Anderson who did Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood!Women are brilliant. Men are dumb.

" Worst PTA film

I loved Joaquin's acting very much but didn't like his beard. For me it is an unsatisfying end and just overall mess. I still think earlier work from PTA is his greatest including There Will Be Blood.P.S. Is Brolin gay in this one? I mean licking chocolate bananas like that... ummm
" The Hippie Detective: Inherent Vice
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,6,"What a cute little film! It really captures the California culture of the late 60s. Two buddies, a nazi LA police officer and a hippie private investigator (he would be considered a dick in the 30s and 40s) combine to break a few cases that appear to completely meaningless. The film is outright funny. Martin Short is great, and Eric Roberts has actually gotten better looking with age. The screenplay and script are very clever, and even the voiceover wasn't that bad (voiceovers are generally poor devices that are used to convey what is actually going on in the film because the director and/or the writer cannot figure out images that will convey the same idea). The plot? and the romantic interests? are fairly lame, but the characters are terrific. This should really be a TV show. There are few films that I review that have characters as well-defined as this film, and they would be perfect for a TV sitcom."
" a mess or a well stractured wacky critique?
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,10,"Paul Thomas Anderson knows how to write a script .He understand structure and how themes should move hand to hand with the characters and plot.THIS IS NO EXCEPTION!!!!!!Most of the haters of this film comlain about the script .It has been called aweful and ineffective.It most certainly is effective.If you pay attention from the beginning (as it is the case with many movies)you wiil not be lost .Chill out blaze your joint up and experience....for example ;the firs scenes introduces the two main characters .You get right of the bat the right idea about the relationship and both of them individually.This allows the plot to start and the next time we get insightfull information about thei relationship is one hour and a half into the movie exactly before the third act begins.this is the first element of many that this great script consist of.the script works. the acting is phenomenal as it is the case with most pta films(this is the guy who extracted a good performance from Adam sandler).Direction is effective , never too loud but ballsy and it certainly makes a statement.Cinematography is raw ,realistic colours and very seventies like.Basically a department from the sunny and hopeful woodstock era and the entrance to the grim and not very pleasant political landscape of the seventies(again a case when technicallity in filmaking serves the themes).Editing is smart and it lets the direction to breathe in the smoke from the burning full of thc californian marijuana. the music by jhonny greenwood is atmospheric representative of the era.Now lets descent into the thematic blilliance of the movie.Its a deconstruction of the deconstruction of the noir genre with a witty sattire on how capitalism and the realization of its involvement in our lives.The watergate scandal makes us want to go back in the simplicity of the sixties and indulge in our nostalgia old love and carelessnes.Even the repressed people who were a crucial part of the puppet game of capitalism start to envy the free spirit of those with no responsibility and while the free man can now grow and become a better person and the dog of the media is emotionally immature and in search for redemption.And while i could decorate this essay with many fancy and beautiful words and metaphors i should not .Because yes this movie is purposefully a mess and you have to experience it to get it .And if you dont like it it does not matter you will not hurt yourself by watching it soo watch it.Inherent vice refers to the mortal and perishable nature of human beings.chocholate melts ,glass brakes ....so lets make up the best of it......"
" PTA's Cruel Joke. Inherent Vice Is A Movie From Hell.
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,1,"What to make of Paul Thomas Anderson? He is simultaneously one of the most gifted filmmakers currently living, and a total hack. The director of the much-studied masterpieces Boogie Nights, Magnolia, and There Will Be Blood, is a genius when it comes to directorial craft, but a consistently absentminded storyteller. Even his best movies, including the wonderful, Adam Sandler-starring Punch Drunk Love, are bereft of a meaningful climax. PTA has a maddening tendency to carry an audience on 2+ hours of masterfully crafted odysseys, only to unceremoniously cut the story off cold in the final few minutes. He's a filmmaker I respect and ultimately hate. His psychedelic noir film, Inherent Vice, is all of his aggravating tendencies and none of his brilliant ones. This movie is a terrible, frustrating, mess. A mystery that is unfathomable, populated with detestable characters, and directed with signature pretense by the brilliant, moronic, PTA.Film noirs are often hard to follow in terms of plot. Hey, even the best noirs rely more on atmosphere than story, but Inherent Vice is on another level entirely. This thing is impossible to understand. Literally impossible. Writing this review, I can't tell you who Joaquin Phoenix's stoner protagonist is, what he is after, what (or even how many) subplots are tossed around. I cannot comprehend what Inherent Vice is about. It has all the ingredients of a mystery, I suppose, but instead of being baked into something meaningful and whole, they've been dumped on the kitchen floor. I defy anyone to tell me that these pieces make sense together. It's not as if this is the first time PTA has promised a coherent logic and settled on the hacky film snob line, ""Well, sometimes life doesn't make sense"". Buzz off, Paul!The cast, for their part, act. There isn't a bad performance, and there is even a fun cameo by Martin Short. The problem isn't the actors, it's the characters. The people we are forced to spend time with in this movie are dreadful company. Joaquin Phoenix, bless him, is insufferable. Like his role in The Master, he gives a great performance (not nearly to the level of that movie, but still) and yet, I wanted to knock his lights out every time he was on screen. He's a horrible, disgusting, scumbag. Call me old fashioned, but those are not qualities I'm dying to see in a protagonist. Nobody else fares much better. PTA has populated this film with the trashiest, smelliest, most horrible people I could ever imagine. Is it supposed to be funny that we're forced to watch them wander through this awful script for two and a half hours? If you find masochism hilarious, I guess.The best I can say of Inherent Vice is that it's The Big Lebowski without the laughs, memorable characters, or charm. In fact, it's more like the demented, Bizarro cousin of The Big Lebowski, where everything good about that film has been twisted into something horrible. What was I meant to get out of this film by the time it ended? I had willed myself to stay awake as this ""mystery"" unfolded with all the clarity and discovery of a stoner's baked-out-of-their-mind ramblings, and held back to urge to strangle myself in place of the terrible people on the screen, only to walk away furious with every single person involved. Inherent Vice is a two and a half hour trip through Hell itself. Curse you, Paul Thomas Anderson, you brilliant, abhorrent you!04/100"
" It's not about understanding, rather about watching
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,8,"For me, this movie is about the play of each and everyone from the cast.
Being (just another) huge fan of Joaquin Phoenix, I would say he delivered a really solid performance, insanely submerging himself into his rather hilarious character.
A pure delight for the seekers of something extraordinary..."
" What... what, uh, just... What?
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,4,"I'm a fan of inaccessible films that take a lot of leaning into, and which, despite your best efforts, you may never fully grasp. But the one thing I always detect about those films it that someone - the writer, the director - knows what's going on even if I don't. There's a sense of mystery and intrigue, yet one can be reasonably convinced that the answers do exist, somehow.This was not that film. I seriously doubt anyone had a clue as to what this was supposed to mean. ""It doesn't have to mean anything, that's the point, we live in a chaotic and meaningless world."" Perhaps that's true, but why should anyone care to witness over two hours of pseudo-noir stream of consciousness then? Explain that? Just hold up a sign that says, ""Life cannot be distilled into satisfying narratives, you're an insane monkey, and nothing means anything,"" and cut to black. I'll believe you, and still have two hours left to hit myself in the head with a hammer. This film is practically like reading ""Finnegan's Wake,"" am I supposed to be dreaming? What do I expect from Paul Thomas Anderson anyway, it's a fair question. I thought The Master at least kept opening new doorways in M.C. Escher's mansion; There Will Be Blood culminated in a brutal unease over man's ""worship of the obelisk,"" (2001: A Space Odyssey); Phantom Thread at least contained a tangible dynamic between two interesting forces...All that said, I wanted desperately to enjoy myself. The scenes were dripping with intensity. The impression that there was something there was ever-present, as PTA is always very apt to tease. The acting was superb, and the narrator gave me just enough yearning for some kind of cosmic order that I could hurdle myself forward through another scene, and ultimately another empty room.Why, Paul Thomas Anderson. Why."
" Didn't even notice the length!
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,10,"Whilst being a complete no, no for those who love a clearly mapped out and coherent narrative structure, for the rest of us, sit back and enjoy. Of course there are stunning moments where we shall have to sit up and thought there is both the Paul Thomas Anderson look of the thing plus his amazing control of numerous participants who all seem to give their all. Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant here, he completely inhabits his role and seems to force the rest of the film to go around him. Katherine Waters is a revelation and the scenes with the two of them crackle with excitement and anticipation. The whole complex rolling mass of a film that revels in its 1970 Californian setting amazes with the extent of the drug taking and how far it had permeated into many parts of American society as it never did in the UK. At times I felt I was sharing a spiff with the characters so dreamlike and surreal this swirling and spinning film is. Brilliant film making and great viewing experience. Didn't even notice the length!"
" DENTIST ON TRAMPOLINE
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,10,"The adventure starts when Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterston) requests the help of private detective Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix). Doc is a hippie who spends most of his time doing drugs. During the film he does alcohol, pot, acid, PCP, and cocaine while trying to solve various cases. Shasta is a former girlfriend who left a few months or a few years ago. She tells Doc she is the girlfriend of a married man Mickey Wolfmann (Eric Roberts in a cameo) and his wife (Serena Scott Thomas) and the wife's boyfriend are scheming to get Mickey committed.The story then weaves levels of complexity introducing new characters seeming unrelated to anything. Some characters such as ""Bigfoot"" (Josh Brolin) appear as stereotypes on the surface, but underneath the exterior is someone totally unexpected. At times this makes fun of 60's stoner films but maintains Coen Brothers type of humor throughout. The characters are far from stock. There is humor in the notes Doc takes down in his book. There were plenty of WTF moments and ""what the heck am I watching?"" feelings. It is a film you must either be stoned or fully engaged to watch. I would recommend the latter the first time through.Doc's journey takes him through a dead biker, Mental Asylum (Straight is Hip), Chinese smuggling, Dentist pedophile, massage parlor, and government conspiracy involving the FBI, DOJ and the Aryan Nation. Try to keep up.This is an oddball cult film that won't appeal to everyone.Guide F-bomb, sex, nudity (Katherine Waterston- FF)"
" A simple review

" I really wanted to like this.
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,1,"I've seen some of PTA's films recently like There Will Be Blood, Magnolia and Boogie Nights. And it's only natural that I really wanted to see Inherent Vice, given that it's a PTA film and has, one of my favourites, Joaquin Phoenix as the lead. The plot summary seemed a bit okayish. But so are the summaries of other Anderson's films. So I had some kind of hope despite the low rating it had.I start the movie, 20 minutes in and I totally lost track of what the hell was happening. For a moment, I thought ""Okay maybe I just had a good lunch and I wanna sleep"". I sleep, then I watch the movie from the beginning. NO CHANGE. The movie becomes painfully self indulgent as it progresses with some laughs here and there. I swear no viewer, without reading the novel, could tell the complete plot. And no, this isn't The Matrix or Interstellar or Donnie Darko, where the necessity for a complex plot is mandatory.I literally had to read the synopsis every 5 minutes to understand what's going. I know that I'm not that dumb, and I do like art films (Tree of Life, The Fountain). But this is not art. Sadly from a great director. Acting is just fine. Phoenix isn't even interested or that's his character perhaps, I don't know, I really didn't care to be honest. Josh Brolin and Owen Wilson just want to get a break from their usual brand of films.Overall, inherent vice is an incoherent mess and please don't hesitate to say this films sucks just because its from Paul Thomas Anderson. Stay away or watch other genuinely great PTA films."
" ""The Big Sleep"" For The Hippie Era
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,7,"Meanders its narrative with the help of a voiceover character (Sortilege) who doesn't assist us to understand what is happening! How does she know so much? Clues to the intrigue are kept being added to by new characters continually popping in. Magnificent performance from Phoenix. Unfortunately we lose interest after the first hour, maybe because we lose track? But the intelligent direction along with the comedy (and Phoenix) are enough to keep us watching. Doesn't help us to understand the '60s though! This is The Big Sleep for the fazed-out hippie era. Well it has an LA PI, a nubile seductress, a disappearance and an unfathomable plot. May need to be re-watched to be fully appreciated."
" Better than people say
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,9,"I loved this film. A lot of people don't like this film because the plot is very confusing and hard to follow but the whole message of the film is that sometimes life doesn't wrap things up in a nice little bow and sometimes everything doesn't come together in the end. I've seen this film a few times now and I like it more everytime I see it. The first time I didn't really like it because I was trying to keep up and get my head around the plot but after I became enlightened to the theme, then I was just able to sit back and experience the journey. It is a great character study. Joaquín pheonix is fantastic and his character is great, all the characters and performances in this film are great and fun, Josh Brolin works really well and had great chemistry with Pheonix, and Martin Short was hilarious when he came into the film he was amazing. There were so many great moments and great lines scattered about like when he visits the golden fang institute. The dialogue on the whole is inconsistent as a lot of it is exposition for the plot but when it isn't that it was fantastic. This is one of the most enjoyable films because you don't need to worry about understanding the plot because you're not supposed to understand it and instead just sit back and relax. The directing is great as always from PTA, the film is really well made. My only criticisms are the film gets weaker in the last 20 mins or so and probably should've ended earlier and that some of the dialogue is just exposition. However I love this film on the whole, I love the soundtrack and the unsatisfying ending reflects the whole film, it reflects the character and how really he gets nothing done in the whole film. And it also reflects life, and how in life often things don't have satisfying endings."
" Did not make it
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,4,"The film is not making sense. It's like trying to ask the mob what's going on. Not only they won't tell you, but asking them is asking to be led anywhere but, and be fleeced. It felt like I was watching TV, not in the 70s. The jibe was off."
" More like Incoherent vice!
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,4,"Inherent Vice is an all time low for writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson. A man with incredible talent and whom has made several great films throughout his career. Inherent Vice however is a sloppy mess of a film with a completely incoherent story that is confusing and convoluted throughout. Not to mention its totally uneventful. Nothing of importance ever really happens in this film and plenty goes unresolved. There are no well developed or interesting characters in the entire story, not even our main character ""Doc"" played by the incredible Joaquin Phoenix. He and the whole supporting cast do the best they can with what they are given, but that sadly is not much at all.It really doesn't feel like much effort is put into the production. Its almost as if you can tell the people involved were not feeling passionate about this project at all and who can blame them? Its really crap.At least with PTA's last film The Master it was very artistic which made up for its lack of a story. Here there isn't any artistic value at all. Its just 2 and a half hours of pointless meandering with undeveloped/uninteresting characters. There is hardly anything redeeming about this."

" The Big Lebowski meets Chinatown, but they don't get on
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,2,"It must have seemed like a good idea to translate 1940s noir to the 1970s, replacing Marlowe and his quart of Old Forester with Doc and his quarter of Red Leb. And in the right hands it might have worked. Sadly it doesn't work here. The film has its moments, but a lot of the devices are too literary to work on the screen. The characters aren't interesting or engaging and there just isn't enough entertainment in the moment by moment unfolding of the plot.At the end of the film the problem is not so much that you don't know what happened as that you don't care."
" The main character was GREAT
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,8,"The movie itself was not incredible, but the main character was nicely designed, with unpredictable behavior and feelings stronger than they seem. The other characters all had their unique parts, but they were all made so that Doc's personality would stand out. The funny part was its similarity with a film noir, but I do not intend to give spoilers"
" Bizarre and almost impossible to follow
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,3,"Anybody who is easily frustrated by a convoluted and incoherent movie plot should probably give 'Inherent Vice' a miss, otherwise the TV might not escape the two-and-a-half hours damage free. This film makes very little sense from the first scene to the last and the ridiculously long running length makes it even more difficult to endure.There's so much going on in this film that it's near impossible to follow what's happening and connect the dots. Many of the scenes have no explanation and seem totally unrelated to anything that's happened previously.I found the whole thing near impossible to follow and even as I write this review, I'm still at a loss as to what actually happened in 'Inherent Vice'. It's a bizarre, confusing and very frustrating movie."
" inherent art and surprising fun
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,10,"Have to admit , i did not see this coming . may be the best way to enjoy a movie is to watch it without expectations . i watched it due to Joaquin Phoenix and was everything i want a movie to be , great script with unbelievable chemistry and it is hilariously funny , in fact it is one of the best comedy , and it is a piece of art . i thank every one involved in the movie . i loved it ."
" Gonna keep this really simple...
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,10,"Not even knowing this was a Paul Anderson movie....my first watch have me so part of the story! Each character was so rich...I almost couldn't blink! I had the film on my DVR and found myself wanting to see it again and again! Just today, I found out why I watched it so often. Paul Anderson! Owning, ""Magnolia Deluxe Edition"", ""Boogie Nights (Deluxe Edition)"", ""Punch Drunk Love (Deluxe Edition)"" etc. I now know I am a Paul Thomas Anderson fan! This movie is an easy watch for those who love a caper-style movie! If you think Joaquin Phoenix is not only a wonderful actor but from another planet...you'll love this. A nice surprise introduction for me of actor Katherine Waterston! I now am on the quest to see all of her movies!I realized after who her father was. She was cast perfect for this role. The ex-girlfriend who you still secretly are hot for! Look, you have to see this at least once...if you end up owning it and addicted, remember who told you!"
" You're not supposed to understand the plot
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,9,"Sorry, I'm just writing here to correct some of the idiots on this website. Do you really think that the amazing PTA would accidentally make the plot hard to follow? No he wouldn't. It was a conscious choice from PTA so it would be faithful to the book it was based apon by Thomas Pynchon. The book and film aren't really about the plot that the audience is desperately trying to follow, it's about the paranoia and the fear of unknown during the transitional period from the 60's to the 70's, with the war on drugs, the hippy life style coming to an end (poor doc), the Charles Manson killings all happening at the same time. Everyone during this period, like our main character and many of the other characters in the film, was at a stage of confusion as they tried to piece together what was happening in the world, who to trust etc. Which is also exactly what the audience is trying to do as well, it's quite genius if you think about it that way. Proving that Inherent Vice is a notable candidate in PTA's hall of fame. Also don't complain about the fact its hard to pin point a genre on this, when was the last time you've seen a PTA film and have actually managed to label its precise genre."
" Noir tribute or noir satire?
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,3,"A private investigator with a love of vice is drawn into a dark and convoluted world of crime and corruption through his love of a woman who used to be his girlfriend. Some sort of modern noir, absolutely brand new in its candid depiction of everything the original noirs only hinted at, but also delighting in the ridiculous tropes of the genre. Leading us in directions we didn't expect and don't necessarily understand, the connections pile up like the ash of a joint and at the end we are left a little dazed and confused."
" Inherent Vice is a bizarrely entertaining stoner epic destined to amuse and captivate some, while deeply frustrate others with its complexity
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,7,"Paul Thomas Anderson has an endowment for freshly provocative storytelling, a gift he has demonstrated in the past with such endeavors as 'Boogie Nights', 'Magnolia', 'There Will Be Blood', and 'The Master' to name some. It is only little wonder why he was one of the few filmmakers compatible for this irreverent hipster-themed comedy inspired by the novel by Thomas Pynchon. Inherent Vice is a decidedly loopy stoner comedy that straps you on a roller coaster through the eccentric Los Angeles counterculture during the psychedelic 60s and 70s when sex, drugs, and rock n' roll exploded into society like wildfire. At the core of this provocative ride is a darkly humorous murder plot that spirals into a devilishly complex fable with the firepower to either entertain viewers with its a heavy haul of idiosyncratic characters and style, or frustrate them its seemingly nonsensical narrative. Set in 1970, this film centers on Doc Spatello (played by Joaquin Phoenix), an absent-minded, pot- loving Los Angeles investigator who's approached by this ex- girlfriend Shasta (played by Katherine Waterston) about her current boyfriend (played by Eric Roberts) and his former lover being a target for a kidnapping. Upon going on an investigation, and a white supremacist suspect (played by Christopher Allen Nelson) is murdered and Doc is informed by Detective Bigfoot (played by Josh Brolin) of Shasta's disappearance. Pursuing after the criminals responsible, Doc is unexpectedly placed on a collision course against a string of mysterious figures including a suspicious musician (played by Owen Wilson), an undercover police informat Sauncho (played by Benicio Del Toro), a Black guerilla family member (played by Michael Kenneth Williams), and mysterious cult leader; each of whom may or may not have a connection behind the murder.For moviegoers aching for a stylish stoner comedy with darkly funny set pieces and eccentric characters dancing into the mix, this movie certainly delivers. For those pining for a coherent story and a wholesome sense of humor, that is a whole another story. This feverishly offbeat stoner epic is one of those rare cinematic endeavors that is much more easier to engage with when you are not bruising your brain trying to follow the plot. Paul Thomas Anderson, the exhilarating storyteller he is, brings a hefty hand in flooding the story with what appears like a dozen of separate subplots and introducing a number of eccentric supporting characters that feels like a chore to count. This unusual style of writing accounts to an irreverent, but brutally confusing that renders the narrative into a state of ambiguity. Sitting through this tale, it is far from unreasonable for viewers to ask ""what does this character have to do with anything?"" or ""what is the point of this?"". The truth of why this story sets out to be confusing however, is that it intends on matching the lead character's state of drug intoxication, and as a result evokes the same amount of confusion as what the lead character is facing. It is a unique style of storytelling that echoes of works of Terry Gilliam's 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. The prime figure of the story is Joaquin Phoenix's Doc Spatello, a goofy stoner who finds himself colliding with a wide number of colorful characters, each of which deliver some smart social commentary on the counterculture of drug-fueled 60s and 70s including the Cold War, racial politics, and the eccentric social environment of Los Angeles that defined the so-called era. It is an adventure that accounts to an appealing blend of whimsical humor and shocking conspiracies that lead to some unpredictable (and occasionally unpleasant) scenes. Judging his writing in the ensemble cast piece 'Magnolia', it is a unique style that best fits Paul Thomas Anderson's directing methodology, while fueling those bothered by the perplexing plot with frustration and possibly boredom.Returning on screen to Anderson's directorial world is Joaquin Phoenix who made his first collaboration with Anderson in 'The Master', which was perhaps more superior than this endeavor. This time, he grapples on the role of Doc Spatello, and gives an devilishly charismatic performance. It is a role that allows Phoenix is expand upon his acting chops with idiosyncratic humor and substance, while channeling on Jeff Daniels's Mr. Lebowski with his drug-fueled humor and intoxicating dialogue. Phoenix is the one that manages to stand out above the absurdly bloated cast, partially since he acquires the most screen time. Josh Brolin delivers plenty of fortitude as Detective Bigfoot for his time, and his chemistry with Phoenix works like a charm. Katherine Waterston makes a good use of her screen time with her flashy sex appeal, particularly in one scene showing a lingering shot of her in the nude while seductively chatting with Phoenix. Owen Wilson brings some good humor to his role, but falls short of screen time. The remainder of the cast consists of a large number of actors and actresses (Reese Witherspoon, Michael Kenneth Williams, Maya Rudolph, Benicio Del Toro, and Martin Short to name a few) are left stranded in underdeveloped roles that pit them almost nothing to work with, which only comes to show how terrifyingly difficult it is to develop so many characters squeezed into a 148-minute runtime. Inherent Vice is a bizarrely entertaining stoner epic that is destined to leave devout fans of Paul Thomas Anderson's works engaged, while leave others stranded in sheer frustration for his absurdly confusing plot. This is easily one of those cinematic tales that will polarize audiences, and for good reasons. After all, it is not your average part-comedy, part-mystery flick. It is one that opens light on the unique style of Anderson directorial skills, while showing little interest of indulging in coherency."
" Inherent Vice
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,5,"I saw the trailer for this film in the cinema, I was instantly attracted to it by the all-star cast, and it was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, Magnolia, There Will Be Blood, The Master), so I'm glad when I got the opportunity to see it. Basically set in the year 1970, in Gordita Beach in southern California, pot head hippie private eye Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Golden Globe nominated Joaquin Phoenix) is approached by ex-lover Shasta Fay Hempworth (Katherine Waterston). Shasta believes that her new lover, married real estate and land developer Mickey Z. Wolfmann (Eric Roberts), is the target of an abduction attempt by his wife and her lover, they want him committed to an insane asylum. Doc goes in search of Wolfmann, but soon finds other people are going missing, including Shasta, who one of them is assumed to be murdered. Along the way, Doc encounters many crazy characters and a wide array of issues from politics, cults, prostitution, the drug trade and dentistry, and involved with the ""Golden Fang"", an international drug smuggling operation. Accompanying Doc most of the way is LAPD detective Lieutenant Detective Christian F. ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen (Josh Brolin), who is straight to the point, but does have a dark side, including need for therapy. Also starring Owen Wilson as Coy Harlingen, Reese Witherspoon as Deputy D.A. Penny Kimball, Benicio Del Toro as Sauncho Smilax, Esq., Martin Short as Dr. Rudy Blatnoyd, D.D.S., Jena Malone as Hope Harlingen, Joanna Newsom as Sortilège, Bridesmaids' Maya Rudolph as Petunia Leeway, Sasha Pieterse as Japonica Fenway, Michael Kenneth Williams as Tariq Khalil, Martin Donovan as Crocker Fenway, Serena Scott Thomas (Kristin's sister) as Sloane Wolfmann, Jeannie Berlin as Aunt Reet, Hong Chau as Jade, porn star Belladonna aka Michelle Sinclair as Clancy Charlock, Elaine Tan as Xandra, Keith Jardine as Puck Beaverton and Peter McRobbie as Adrian Prussia. Phoenix certainly stands out as the drug addled private eye, then little-know Waterston is impressive, all the other big names in the cast, including the adult actress, add something in their moments too. The film is based on the novel by Thomas Pynchon, his books have been considered unfilmable, and you can see why with this film, is is completely psychedelic and you can hardly concentrate getting entangled with the little storyline there is, but it is memorable for the use of colour and all details of the 1970s setting, a preposterous but interesting enough crime comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay for Paul Thomas Anderson and Best Costume Design. Worth watching!"
" Don't even waster your time
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a convoluted mess, I can't even explain what the story line is. Phoenix is in every scene, never sitting up normally, always lying down, or sprawled on the floor after a pummeling, and constantly smoking weed, and there's the annoying voice over. If you like David Lynch movies then this movie is for you. Don't try to make sense of it, just marvel that someone would waste their time trying to adapt it from a book that is ranked No. 32,833 on Amazon. It rambles on so much that you will completely forget what the main plot is supposed to be. Case in point: There are 110 cast members listed in the credits, I defy anyone to recall what was said by any one of them, and more importantly how they contributed to the plot. The budget was $20 million, small in comparison to the typical Hollywood film and the opening weekend was an abysmal $328,000, word of mouth certainly worked in this case. Save yourself the cost of renting it and just have someone you really don't care for explain the plot to you, in depth, so you can have another reason to dislike that person even more."
" Inherent Vice
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,7,"I don't know what to think about this movie. PTA is sure a good director , TWBB is one of my most favorite movies. But Inherent Vice is different. It's overly long , slow dialogue and it was hard to get into it. The cast and the performances are perfect though and I loved the style of the film. This isn't for everyone. Most people will find it a bit boring (like me) but I kinda enjoyed the last hour or so. And others will love it and praise it. 7/10 (too long , slow , not enough is going on to keep my interest) I still suggest to watch it and decide for yourself if you like it or not."
" Inherent Vice
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"'Inherent Vice' is the next feature film from Paul Thomas Anderson and you can tell. It boasts a great soundtrack, brilliant acting and a very convoluted story as it tells the story of a private detective (Phoenix) as he investigates into the disappearance of a former girlfriend.The screenplay is very confusing. It is hard to follow and purposely so as it introduces many characters and multiple stories but I have heard that this aspect of the screenplay is very true to the original source material. All I could do was admit that the film was too bewildering and to enjoy the many jokes and humorous situations.Joaquin Phoenix is tremendous as the main character Larry ""Doc"" Sportello. He is complimented with a great supporting cast such as Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro.Overall, 'Inherent Vice' is not a typical popcorn flick and I was very confused by the overwhelming plot but it is fun and very well made and so I have given it a final rating of 3.5 stars."
" were the 70s really this boring?
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,2,"Less than 30 minutes into this self-absorbed slugfest of a movie I felt like I'd been pumped full of valium and zombified. Why make a movie this lacklustre? Perhaps I'm missing the point. Maybe Inherent Vice is actually some kind of subtlety-laced masterpiece of understated nuance and restraint, but to me it was unforgivably boring. I lasted until the scene at the massage parlour reception desk, which I can only describe as the most uncomfortably vacuous 3 minutes of cinema in living memory. How could anyone script that scene without immediately wanting to rip up and burn everything they've ever written? Terrible.As it happens, the recreation of 1970s post-hippie fallout America looked pretty spot on to me, but that counts for zero when you lend it to a movie that's about as entertaining as watching stick insects do tai chi. Awful."
" Seventies Sizzle
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,5,"Hired to investigate a mysterious disappearance, a 1970s hippie private detective's search efforts are hampered by oddball characters, the allure of drugs and 'free love' in this offbeat crime drama from Paul Thomas Anderson. With dissolve and overlap edits in plentiful supply, as well as Oscar nominated costumes that are both true to the era and inventive, 'Inherent Vice' is as good-looking a film as any by Anderson - yet with many mixed reviews out there, it has proved to be one of his most divisive films with event ardent fans turning their back. The dislike is understandable. The film is populated with so many principal characters that there is never the chance to know any of them in any depth, not even the protagonist. Much of the film is also accompanied by voice-over narration that does little other than spell out what could easily be surmised. At the same time though, the film has at least a couple of remarkable performances. While he does not have much of a character to work with, Joaquin Phoenix's acting range is incredible when one considers that the milquetoast star of the previous year's 'Her' is the same actor playing the disheveled PI here. Josh Brolin also brings some welcome comic relief with his hard-nosed police detective who has a soft spot for ice cream treats and who may not be as different from Phoenix as initial appearances would have it. Whether these two notable performances are enough to support a rambling two-and-a-half hour feature is debatable though, and this is therefore a film best approached with caution."
" Lebowski gone wrong
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,3,"While browsing the movies at a local library, this one jumped out at me - psychedelic looking cover, big list of name actors on the front, interesting and plot blurb on the back...so I took a chance. And ended up wasting two and half hours watching what looked like an attempt to do a prequel to The Big Lebowski that went wrong in every way possible.The film is based on a book, so I assume there was a plot buried in there somewhere under all the mumbled, slurred or whispered dialog, confusing and disconnected scenes that go nowhere and cardboard acting. The director must have realized that no one was going to be able to follow this, so he added a hippie astrologer chick as the narrator, but she's even more confusing and annoying than the movie she's trying to explain.From the start I couldn't tell what was going on, and every time I felt like I might be starting to understand a bit of it, the plot (such as it was) would veer off in a completely different direction. When the thing finally ended, I had no idea what happened, I was just glad it was over.It had something to do with a stoner detective named Doc living in the early 1970s. He gets tipped off about a missing millionaire real estate developer by his crazy ex-girlfriend. But then he is told about something called the ""Golden Fang"" by an Asian prostitute. But before he gets too deep into that, he is sidetracked by a supposedly dead jazz musician who turns out to be an unwilling FBI undercover agent. And there's a bitter police detective named Bigfoot who wants to be an actor and seems to get all his leads from Doc. None of this really adds up to a coherent story.I have to give the movie credit for using some interesting music in the soundtrack (Can's ""Vitamin C"", Neil Young's ""Journey Through the Past"", etc). Some of the performances are good like Josh Brolin as Bigfoot, and occasionally Joaquin Phoenix as Doc, when he's not mugging for the camera. There were a couple laughs, although most of the attempts at humor fall pretty flat.Overall recommendation: avoid. There are far better ways you could waste two and a half hours of your life."
