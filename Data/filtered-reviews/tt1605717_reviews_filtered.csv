" Watch some Frank Sidebottom on YouTube instead
",2021-04-12 00:00:00,1,"Bleak, cynical, insincere, parasitic, postmodern, repugnant, grim, godless guff. The complete and polar opposite to everything the real Frank Sidebottom (Chris Sievey's creation) represented and emanated.Filmmaking at its most pretentious and joyless. Existentially vapid, utter dreck!"
" Odd - in a Good Way
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"One of those rare cinematic moments where the audience gets some real original content. Frank: fine acting and an original story that changes between a light and a heavier tone, between comedy and drama naturally, make this one a real cinematic feast - if you like the unusual, the odd, the rare, and if you are willingly to dive deep into a strange and bizarre world."
" Weird as S*#t and profoundly amazing
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,8,Couldn't take my eyes off it. Owns itself as an indie masterpiece.
" The message of the movie have not reached me
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,5,"Are you blessed with talent or not?
Do you have to bring your talent to the surface first?
If so, how?
Or are you just untalented?Jon would like to be a songwriter. He has trouble putting his thoughts and feelings into songs. In 'Frank' you see his journey as he tries to find inspiration/creativity. The character Frank is his role model and he gives himself to his dream and tries to make it come true. At the same time, he tries to record an album with his band, which proves to be more difficult than expected.The movie is definitely something different and I have not seen anything like this before. However, I could not do anything with the movie over large parts. Without the character of Frank with his plastic head, the movie would lose one, if not the, crucial point. In my opinion, this is the only fact that makes the movie special.The whole time you're thinking, why is this guy wearing a plastic head and what's it all about? This has little to do with the story. Unfortunately, the story is to a large extent meagre. It's a group of partly eccentric and funny characters who are trying to record an album.The quintessence of the movie is to convey that it is much more important to be satisfied with what you have accomplished and that what you do (here the music) must please you. Success, recognition and the taste of the masses is not what matters. Actually, a nice message, unfortunately it did not reach me. Overall, not the kind of movie that speaks to me personally."
" Emotional
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,8,"Chris Sievey was a comedian and musician who started his music career by hitchhiking with his brother and heading to the headquarters of Apple Records, where they did a sit-in and demanded to meet one of The Beatles. Instead, they got to play a song for the head of A&R Tony King.His band The Freshies had their biggest hit with ""I'm in Love with the Girl on the Manchester Virgin Megastore Checkout Desk,"" but were mostly known only in Manchester. Then, a character that Sievey created, Frank Sidebottom, took over.Frank was originally a superfan of The Freshies but the popularity of the character led Sievey to focus his output on strictly making records as Frank. In the late 80's and early 90's, Frank appeared on the British version of Remote Control, as well as live performances and even a comic strip. He disappeared until 2005, when his Frank Sidebottom's Proper Telly Show in B/W appeared on television and then he never went away again until Sievey's death. His song ""Christmas is Really Fantastic"" was a big hit and there was even a social media campaign to get his song ""Guess Who's Been on Match of the Day"" on the charts.Jon Ronson was the keyboard player for Frank several times, touring with him while beginning his writing career, which has brought him into the orbit of David Icke and Alex Jones before anyone in this country really knew who they were, unlike now when conspiracy theories are everywhere. His book The Men Who Stare at Goats became a movie, then he mined his past to create the script - based on his newspaper article and co-written with Peter Straughan - for the mask-filled movie we're about to discuss.Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) dreams of being a rock star, but has no idea how to get there. One day, by whim or fate or accident, he watches a man try to drown himself. That man was the keyboardist for the Soronprfbs, an experimental group that he is invited to play with that very night. Walking in off the street, he sees the lead singer, Frank (Michael Fassbender), a man with a very large masked head that he plugs a microphone into. Before he can get his bearings, the band begins to play and the performance just starts to come together when Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal) flips out and destroys her KORG keyboard.The band moves on. Jon cannot.Soon, Frank calls him and invites him to join the band. Unknowingly, that means going to Ireland for an extended period to record an album. Jon struggles to be accepted by the rest of the band, which includes Baraque and Nana (Carla Azar, from Autolux, which is fantastic). As he secretly records the band, they begin to get noticed, which is the very thing that Frank both wants and fears most.Stephen Rennicks from The Prunes wrote much of the music in this and it feels so real. The scenes where the songs come together are magical. And the scene in the diner, where fans are asking Jon about the band and wondering how crazy everyone is and not understanding that they are real people, underscores the issues of mental illness versus art that Roky Erickson, Wesley Willis and Daniel Johnston all really lived.I've only seen one other Larry Abrahamson film before, 2015's Room, but I really need to take the time and track down everything else he's made. This movie really took me on a journey and I found myself filled with emotion at the end, as Frank is revealed.This has my highest recommendation."
" Bizarre yet enjoyable to watch
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,9,"This's one of the strangest movies I've seen. And you know what? That's not a bad thing. As crazy as it is, there's a lot of creativity and heart even to it. It's loosely inspired by the singer and band leader Frank Sidebottom who was best known for wearing an oversized paper mache mask.The story's seen through the eyes of the new member who does his best to fit which isn't made easy by the other members who are exclusive. The most hostile one is his emotionally unstable girlfriend played by Maggie. Slowly and slowly he finds his place in the group with help from the eccentric frontman.The story's pretty simple yet what makes it stand out are the larger-than-life characters and dialogue. One thing I find funny yet backhanded are the two French-speaking members who talk smack about the main character. Only towards the end do they speak broken English.Frank's a strange yet enjoyable film that I highly recommend. It has a lot of funny moments, but touching and heartfelt ones too to balance out the insanity witnessed by the viewer. If you have a second and are in the mood for something strange and straight out of a fever dream(a good one that is), than this's for you."
" A truly unique experience
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,10,"Just watched it for the second time and i liked it even more than the first.
I don't even know how to describe it, but it's just a nice little comedy/drama with some tragedy to. The actors all do great, but i especially enjoy watching Michael Fassbender in a role like this, he does it so well and with great energy.
The comedy has no small role, there are several hilarious scenes and in general the movie is just filled with great moments.
The music is obviously a bit different, but i can't help but love it anyway.I was between a 9 and a 10, but upon asking myself what downsides the movie has i couldn't find any. I think i found a new favorite movie that i'll return to."
" Amazing !
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,10,Thats so sweet film ! An impressive movie. Really funny and sad
" Different...
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,7,"""Frank"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we watch a man joining an eccentric pop band in order to become a famous musician. There he meets Frank who is always wear a big mask and he is a very mysterious person.I liked this movie very much because it had a simple but very mysterious and interesting plot. The interpretations of both Domhnall Gleeson who played as Jon Burroughs and Michael Fassbender who played as Frank were very good and I believe that their interpretations made the difference in this movie. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Maggie Gyllenhaal's who played as Clara and she was equally good. Finally, I have to say that ""Frank"" is a very good and interesting movie that has deeper meanings and amazing performances made by the cast."
" Big head mode.
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,7,"'Frank (2014)' is never quite what you expect, telling its tale of misfit rockstars with just the right amount quirkiness. It's funny but it also has a really serious edge to it, dealing with difficult themes throughout. It does some interesting things with its protagonist, which I won't spoil, and is constantly engaging. Its messages are wonderfully nuanced and, in a way, antithetical to the sort of stuff the genre tends to peddle. It's an odd film, for sure, but it's entertaining and has something important to say. 7/10"
" An underrated gem
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,10,"Jon wants to be a musician; there's only one problem: he sucks at it.
Frank is a musical genius; capable of coming up with a great song in a matter of seconds. He also suffers from a mental illness and always wears a giant paper mache head.Jon really wants to be like him.As someome with practically no musical talent, I completely relate with Jon's frustation and feelings towards Frank. Like a mix of jealousy and admiration.I love how this film explores this feeling I often get, that because I didn't have a tragic past, I somehow don't deserve to be succesful. Like I haven't earned it.Initially, Jon would love to have a tragic past or a mental illness, because that way he feels he will finally succeed as an artist, like Frank.
But as it's so heartbreakingly revealed to him, Frank's condition isn't some cool quirk that made him talented, but a real illness that must be taken seriously, which is something he never did.This movie is a truly underrated gem and features one of Michael Fassbender's best performances, and you almost never see his face.The final scene, when they sing ""I Love You All"" is pure perfection and it always makes me feel like crying."
" What happened to Frank
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,7,"-What happened to Frank? -Something must have happened to make him like that. -Nothing happened to him. He's got a mental illness. -The torment he went through...to make the great musc. -The torment didn't make the music. He was always musical. If anything, it solwed him down. ---"
" It was bad but can see why some people liked it.
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,3,"I was looking forward to this movie for some time as it looked delightfully quirky and fun. When I watched it it was super sad and boring. I like weird movies so I was thinking this would be great but this was honestly not that strange and was very gritty actually. I like a gritty movie that keeps me on the edge of my seat but this movie kind of just trudged on. It was enough to keep my attention for the full movie but nothing more. I feel like I gained nothing from this movie. I did not laugh, I did not have my heart flutter, I did not get attached to any characters. There was nothing here for me but I guess someone who relates to the pain that comes with mental illness or someone with very different taste could enjoy this movie. I can't say something was wrong with it just that I was not the target audience. I suspect not many people are a good fit but maybe this is the perfect movie for a select few."
" An Incredibly Unique And Thought Provoking Music Piece
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,7,"Going into this the only knowledge I had was the small bit that Chris Stuckman talks about this movie. Which was basically nothing, I write my own music. Seeing this film motivated me to both want to go and try to record and make like 50 songs in an hour, but also to completely throw away my instruments and never play again. The movie's main character is Jon, a musician who is struggling to find his sound. He joins a band with an enigmatic main singer called Frank. Frank wears a head and never takes it off. The movie follows the bands progression, but it's more then just a band story. It also discusses what makes music enjoyable, and the creative vision artists have. This is definitely going to be on my fun quirky movies list. This one is unique, and I can see people being divided on it, the characters are all quirky and weird with the exception of Jon. Overall a fun 7.5/10. If you wanna watch this one you have to be in the right headspace for it. Be open to new ideas and let the movie guide you, the movie never drags, I rarely say that about a movie but it doesn't. Franks strange habits and seeing Jon adapt to them keep you entertained and interested the whole way through, and without spoiling it the ending and answer to who is behind the head is satisfying."
" Don't watch this film, it does not get better!
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,4,"I could sympathise with the main character, trying to make up Pop songs, and the seemingly lucky break he gets. But for me it went down-hill, then charactors and plot did not seem believable, and it left me with a bad feeling."
" ""Lone standing tuft""
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,8,"This movie was on my watchlist for quite some time now, but it turned out to be a great film. Gave some really good laughs, and some heartbreaking moments too. I really love Michael Fassbender, and he was amazing, as always.
Would really LOVE to hear the Soronprf... in real life, totally my kind of music. <3"
" Seeing the world different
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,9,"I watched this movie mre than once. At the first time I thought, well... ok...what's going on? :) But looking the movie foward I just love this movie. It's funny, extraordinary and just wondeful.I laughed and some tears run down my face. I like the actors and the the camera work. So if you missed it you should have look at this piece of art."
" good indie flick
",2019-09-16 00:00:00,8,"This dramedy follows a callow young man's experience as keyboardist in an avant-garde band headed by a guy who never removes the big puppet-head that covers his face. In spite of what some people say, it's not really all that weird by indie-film standards, but it is quite entertaining, with a deservedly praised performance by Fassbender and an excellent, overlooked one by Maggie Gyllenhaal as his fierce theremin player.While a lot of people complain about a shift in tone as the movie progresses, describing it as a wacky comedy that inexplicably turns dark, to me the movie feels all of a piece. It's not all *that* funny in the first part and not all *that* dark in the last, and really, if you are surprised that the movie delves into mental illness then I feel you weren't really paying attention to the story.The movie has a lot to say about art and artists, but what it's saying isn't explicit, and the movie leaves the viewer with questions. Not questions you need to answer, but questions to ponder."
" Hits a wall after 40 minutes.
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,5,Great but burns out quickly. The film runs out of steam in a big way once the novelty of the characters runs out and you discover there is no real plot.
" Unwatchable!
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,1,"Really crap!, so bad not even one to tolerate past the half hour mark!"
" The novelty wears off fast
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,4,"A strange movie that obviously tries to go against the grain and explore some dark topics while aiming for a dry dark comedy tone. For a while it works, as in the beginning the acting of Domhnall Gleeson keeps you entertained, and it's easy to get into the whole surreal premise.However, after spending more time with the characters and as soon as the plot slows down, the novelty wears off. The movie becomes tedious, very predictable and (FRANKly) boring, with it's attempts at comedy landing disappointingly short and characters somehow managing to be at once both obnoxious and uninteresting.Laden with predictable cuts and a boring story that tries to tackle the topic of mental disease & isolation but barely manages to scratch the surface, finally we arrive at the very hokey ending, thinking of how much better this could have been."
" enjoyable
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,7,"I found this film good not only because of the outlandish humour but the performances heavily drew the story. Gleeson, Fassbender and Gyllenhaal all did amazing jobs in providing powerful performances. The plot fell thin at points but the overall message was well pushed by the directior. I would recommend it."
" Instead of Frank the should have called it Insincere
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,1,"I only have one word for this movie: pretentious. The way the band behaves while rehearsing, and their general approach to creativity, depicts nothing real about musicians. Not even with those very avant-garde types. Maybe that's the point with the movie and the message went over my head, but then it's not very well explained what the movie is about (and I do think the narrative and message isn't very hard to understand). I think this movie perfectly shows what happens when someone acts as if they were musicians."
" Not lacking in originality, but a difficult ride if you don't care for the characters
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,6,"Frank is a film that is misleading in two ways - firstly, despite reprising the head, the titular character is not an attempt at the existing Frank Sidebottom character. Secondly, it is often presented as a comedy, which is true in some ways but ultimately the film is more a sort of dark comedy/satire that largely veers into drama territory and away from jokes.
That said, the film documents a young keyboardist who is drafted into a band led by the titular Frank. The band is avant-garde and difficult with Frank as a sort of underappreciated genius who inspires devotion from his band - a devotion which allows him to push them to their outer limits both artistically and personally. The young keyboardist desires to push things in a more radio-friendly direction and this creates tension with the existing band members who tend to see Frank's art as sacred.
Without giving away too much of the plot, the film explores the tension between these two impulses and the members of the band who support either one - and how a sudden rise in popularity pushes that tension to a boiling point.
All of this has the makings of a great film, but there is little to grasp onto. The music is alright but hardly the avant-garde masterwork it would need to be to make the discussion of Frank's genius make sense. The general underlying thought of the film seems to be that everyone's interest in Frank is primarily for their own greedy reasons - that the mask (literally and figuratively) and not the man behind it is what drives their interest. This would befit a character who had an eccentric but undeniably masterful body of work - word-of-mouth cult figures like Daniel Johnston, R. Stevie Moore, and Gary Wilson come to mind - but the music itself is unfortunately somewhat forgettable and this undermines Frank's own outsider art appeal. The characters are largely quite greedy and self-involved in keeping with that theme, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I don't think the film keeps the requisite distance from the characters to make it work, and so you are left with the sense that it wants you to both identify with and dislike everyone. The effect, for me, was exhausting - but I can understand the appeal for many.
The film is certainly well shot and well acted, and it is deserving of recognition for its unique concept, but it left me and my friends somewhat cold and empty afterwards. If you're looking for a straightforward comedy about being in a band, like this was marketed as, you'd best go for the Swedish film ""We Are The Best"" which has a more empathetic approach to its characters that contrasts with its darker undercurrents. If you want to explore a unique take on the phenomenon of the outsider artist and the struggle over artistic license, and don't mind a massive dose of cynicism in the process, then you may strongly connect with Frank in a way that I couldn't."
" Frank But Not As We Know Him
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,7,"Frank is a 2014 film directed by Lenny Abrahamson, produced by David Barron, Ed Guiney and Stevie Lee and written by Jon Ronson and Peter Straughan. Starring Michael Fassbender, Domhnall Gleeson, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Scoot McNairy, and François Civil. Frank is a story told through the eyes of Jon, a young keyboard player, portrayed by the affable Domhnall Gleeson, who becomes immersed in the world of a papier-mâché-headed musician Frank - Michael Fassbender - and a supporting cast of equally weird band members: Maggie Gyllenhaal who plays Clara, the quirky and highly temperamental Theremin player, as well as Don, Baraque and Nana. The film is very loosely based on Jon Ronson's own experience of playing keyboard in Frank Sidebottom's Cor Blimey Big Band. I say loosely based; I expected this film to be a biography of Sidebottom. I should have known better. For these that are uninitiated, he was the creation of former one-hit wonder, Chris Sievey (1955-2010), an aspiring pop star who had enjoyed brief success in the 70s as part of the band The Freshies and their catchy hit 'I'm In Love With The Girl On The Manchester Virgin Megastore Checkout Desk'. In essence, 'Frank' was a quasi-cartoon character with a giant papier mâché head, who was still living with his Mum and staying with his Auntie at the seaside in Blackpool at the age of thirty-five. A larger than life creation, half-tormented and half-supported by cardboard characters, Frank would sing cover versions of songs on a plinkety-plonk Bontempi keyboard. The main lyrics would always be changed to accommodate his home town of Timperley, such as Bruce Springsteen's Born in Timperley; the Kinks's Timperley Sunset and Eddie Cochran's Timperley Blues. Frank's use of song lyrics was one of a kind. Only he could think of rhyming visa with pepperoni pizza and lama with Bananarama. Act I of Frank follows the band to an isolated cabin in Ireland as they prepare to record their debut album. Spurred on by a tiny whiff of success, they are then invited to a music festival to perform in Austin, Texas. The plot appears simplistic, in that the central character goes on a journey of discovery over who Frank is, but the themes explored in the film are anything but. Jon the character and Jon Ronson are both obsessed with the change which occurs when Frank puts the head on and assumes the character of 'Frank'. For much of the film we only see Frank with his head on. This leads to some great comic moments such as seeing Frank shower with a plastic bag on his head, Frank describing his facial expressions out loud and Frank boxing and being interviewed at the South by Southwest Music Festival. Chris Sievey was ahead of his time. He predated the ethics of Punk by starting his own label in 1974 and he produced the first ever multi-media single in 1983 by incorporating a ZX Spectrum game. We see this in the film, when he devises his own system of music notation and pushes the boundaries over what can be used as an instrument.
The one anecdote in the film, which does have a grain of truth, is how Ronson ended up playing in Frank's band. Sidebottom was booked to play at London Poly and his usual keyboard player was indisposed. He asked Ronson, the ENTS officer, if he knew how to play the chords, C, D, E, to which Ronson replied that yes, he did. So began his long and somewhat surreal stint in Frank's band. I met Jon Ronson many times in the late eighties when my mate used to stalk his band, The Man from Del Monte. A gentle soul with a kind of ethereal quality about him, he always struck me as being one of life's great thinkers, something that is evident throughout the film. The idea had come from his frustration that the genius behind Frank Sidebottom seemed to delight in producing childlike nonsense. Whenever the chance came along for real fame and exposure, Chris Sievey would self-destruct. One such example is when Frank was asked to support the band Bros in 1989 and ended up being booed off stage as no one understood the irony of his music. Ronson remained mystified by this and wanted to write a film based on the premise that there are some people who are just too 'fantastically strange' to make it in the mainstream. He wanted to touch upon elements from other performers such as Captain Beefheart and Daniel Johnston. Ronson must have known that a straight-forward biopic would have run the risk that the audience simply would not 'get' Frank Sidebottom and his childlike simplicity. This was the reason that Frank's television career bombed, as for some inexplicable reason, his humour did not translate to the small screen. Furthermore, Ronson felt aggrieved that Frank had nurtured so much genuine talent of artists such as Mark Radcliffe, Chris Evans and Caroline Aherne. These people had risen to the stratospheres of success, whilst Frank Sidebottom remained very much rooted in the mediocre; doing small gigs and pub pop quizzes. This film proved more of a chance for Ronson to vocalise his frustrations out loud rather than a straight forward biopic. He had discussed the idea with Chris Sievey prior to his premature death in 2010 and received his blessing. I spent a considerable time during my student days, following Frank Sidebottom around the Northern circuit. I was one of the few, who met him once without his head on, when he was Chris Sievey. ""You're Frank Sidebottom"" I teased him, ""I can tell it's you by the voice and the mannerisms."" ""Frank Sidebottom?"" He questioned. ""Who's he? I know nothing about a Frank Sidebottom. I'm Chris. I'm just here with my mates."" He then proceeded to delight in playing this charade for a good twenty minutes, blurring the lines of reality, that Frank was a real person. His parting shot to me had been to tell me to try and stand at the front of the hall by the stage. It was one of the best nights of my life, as Frank sang Fireball XL5 to me. My mate and I also once bumped into him in a chip shop on the Wirral before a gig, when he was Frank Sidebottom. He'd gone in the chippy to buy some chips, still with the head on and stood chatting away to us as though it was the most normal thing in the world to wear a giant head - and attempt to eat a bag of chips! It was the pretence that Chris loved most about being Frank and it is this element that Ronson brings in repeatedly throughout the film. The insightful, first-person voiceover allows the
audience to wonder with Jon, 'What goes on inside that head...?' Similarly, one starts to contemplate if Frank is different without his head and what has prompted him to mask his true persona? Perhaps it is only in wearing a mask that one can truly express oneself: thus, in deception lies the truth? For Chris Sievey, it was all part of the game of being Frank Sidebottom and the comedy of maintaining the charade. Yet in the film, these questions are only answered in the light of mental illness and such details are presented as irrelevant to the fact that these characters are also outsiders to society. That is what makes a true genius: being an outsider and dealing with the underlying difficulties this presents. To me, this film is more Jon Ronson than Frank Sidebottom. It is Jon Ronson's gift to Chris Sievey. Frank's view of life was childlike. Much of that is lost in the film because its need to incorporate elements of mental health issues. I wanted more of the simplicity, of humour that Frank encapsulated; the jokes about Queen's Freddie Mer-curie, the ending of every song with, 'You know it is, it really is."", his wicked put-downs to his puppet nemesis Little Frank, the puns on language and the obsession with being in 'showbusiness' but it just wasn't there. At times the film appeared far too serious to be linked to Frank Sidebottom. I almost wanted the real Frank to enter the stage and declare in one of his well-used catch-phrases, ""Can't we have a few laughs? Have a bit of light-heartedness."" Therefore, when judged from the point of view of a Frank Sidebottom fan, sadly, it doesn't work. Yet, judging from the point of view of a film lover, it is a gentle and at times poignant and thoughtful movie. It could have become quite farcical or slapstick, but the director, Lenny Abrahamson is experienced in blending comedy and pathos and turns the film more into a modern fairy-tale or fable, in a way that recalls Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands, and even to an extent in its treatment of outsiders, Truffaut's Antoinelle Doinel films or Guillermo del Toro's, The Shape of Water. I didn't come out of seeing this movie laughing out loud in the way that I used to laugh during and after a Frank Sidebottom gig. I came out feeling moved by the story and understanding more the reasons why Chris Sievey never gained the acclaim that he richly deserved in his all too brief a lifetime. If this film makes more people discover the unadulterated joy that was Frank Sidebottom's comedy then so much the better. A documentary, 'Being Frank - the Chris Sievey Story' has recently been shown at the BFI London Film Festival and a Manchester premier is scheduled for next year. These two films should be shown side by side as a tribute to Frank Sidebottom because they enable us to understand the man and his creation more and as Frank himself would have concluded, ""You know they do. They really do."
" Good film, but not for everyone's taste
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,8,"Like Frank's band's music, not everyone is going to love this film, but it is a very good one. Well acted, well crafted, its only issue is the subject, which is both very weird and sensitive, funny and terribly tragic. It's a road trip movie, in its essence: the normal guy gets swept by the charisma and magic of a band and he joins them, body and soul. Yet the ending is not happy, nor extremely sad, it's just... what did you expect it was going to happen? It also feels like a play, with basically four actors and some stand ins. They are all great in their performances, if you dig the story. It all stands on that one point: will you understand the story and the feelings of the characters? Bottom line: if you like it, you will probably love it. You might not like it."
" A deep message
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,2,"Whether you consider this movie to be weird, incomprehensible, or simply a huge pile of trash, I consider it to be an incredibly accurate depiction of what is actually important in life. All that matters is how these mentally issued people, while miserable by themselves, make themselves happy, and in my opinion part of the movie represents that. The most important thing in life isn't what others think of you, but its sticking to what makes you feel complete. Who cares what the world thinks about them? Even if they are taken as a huge joke they will still have something that most people don't; people who they can understand, and be understood by."
" An easy TEN!
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,10,"I wouldn't normally give any film 10, but I do it here to make a point (and because I can't give it a 9.5). Any movie this left of centre was always going to provoke divided reactions, so the 1's and 2's and the disgusted comments don't come as a surprise.What's weirder than the movie itself is that it is actually based on the keyboardist's actual experience.I found this movie funny at times, intensely dramatic and tremendously moving.Definitely NOT for those who just want to be satisfyingly 'entertained' with all their questions answered by the end of the last act."
" WTF I just watched?!

",2018-05-03 00:00:00,6,"Parody that unfortunately plays on our feelings. Hard to believe that main character Jon (despite film's title) is intrigued by these characters. Well-acted, direction and production good but film's purpose escapes me. Maybe reading Jon Ronson's original article that inspired the film would help."
" I want this to be a real band that I can buy records from and see live!
",2018-04-14 00:00:00,10,"The last time I saw a movie where I bought the soundtrack immediately following was for Swiss Army Man. But that movie wasn't about music - it just happened to have a fantastic soundtrack. Frank IS about music (and musicians), and the fictional band isn't just ""pretty darn good for a fictional band"" - THEY ARE EXCELLENT AS A BAND. I was sorta thinking Joy Division and The Residents, but somebody else said Flaming Lips and Jim Morrison, and I can kinda see that too.The film very much nails the creative process too. On the soundtrack it was great to hear the film's improvisation and genesis version of ""I Love You All"" as well as the finished studio production (that doesn't appear in the film per se, but would have been the fictional band's attempt at recording a rehearsed and more developed version of the song). I relate to this process, as I've been in several (original music) bands for 35+ years (earning several hundred dollars in total so far, so yeah, it was a success!)"
" Best Band Film since The Commitments
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,7,"Ok, I admit it, I had no idea who Frank Sidebottom was until now. At first this fact kind of made me dislike the film a little bit, since what I thought original really wasn´t, but then it seems the script is based on real experience. In the end, one thing for another, inspiration can arrive from anywhere, it doesn´t really matter if the film borrows or not. It´s not supposed to have anything to do with Sidebottoms and, in any case, it´s not enough for it to be a reasonable criticism and I don´t really care for any of it. Having that little controversy out of the way, it´s got to be said, Frank does for pseudo-intelectual art pop what The Commitments did for soul or Crossroads did for blues. A mediocre kid gets inside a world he doesn´t understand and the audience probably won´t either. There is no need to explain much. The rhythm section is weird cause they´re weird, it´s not important, Maggie Gyllenhaal´s character is detestable, yes, that´s why she´s known as the crazy b**ch, and Frank wears a fake head just because. It´s all a great depiction of this kind of isolated artists who, talented or not, follow their passion with an obnoxious strictness, who don´t hold back any of their follies and emotional imbalances, who might change their minds every second and still be convinced they´re making absolute sense. These misfits exist, and the films honours all the weirdness without judging it, after all, the main character is craving to belong. Domhnall Gleeson´s stiff acting fits the plot, he´s suposed to be lame. He is in no position to ever understand the importance of creative control or edgy integrity. It might not mean anything, it might not even be there to begin with. He has no clue. All of these are complicated, unpopular matters dealt with simplicity and inteligence. More important than that, I found it hilarious right from the first scene. Frank worryingly asking before the big show ""so they don´t know us and love us?"" had me laughing like Muttley, for real."
" Unique and Entertaining
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,9,"Frank is a quirky, thrilling, and extremely entertaining film about an underground musician with a huge fake head and his band's mission of making an album, which is led astray by a newcomer. With its incredible soundtrack and stellar performances from Michael Fassbender, Domhnall Gleeson, and others, it's truly worth watching.Lenny Abrahamson does a great job of blending the music the bands play into the soundtrack for the whole film. This blending of diagetic and nondiagetic sound gives the film a charming quality and leads you to be more engrossed in it. Not only the band's music, but the dynamic of the band itself is gripping the whole way through. Although it's hard to pick a favorite, Fassbender's performance as Frank is concrete and strange in the best way. Pair this with the insecure qualities of Domhnall Gleeson as Jon and you have a great dynamic of friendliness, frustration, and even manipulation. After many watches, this movie remains truly impressive and worth watching more.With that said, some of the second half of the movie doesn't end up being as surreal and entertaining as the rest. Maybe it's a needed rest in the time line of the movie, but after each watch, this segment just doesn't remain as attention grabbing as the rest. That's only a minor gripe though, as I personally am a huge fan of this film.Overall, with a great story, acting, soundtrack, and more, Frank is a unique and excellent movie that I would recommend anybody to watch."
" Beautiful.
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,10,"You remember when all those people were reported to have depressive episodes after seeing 'Avatar' because they wanted to live in that alien world? Well I need a support group for people that got that way after watching 'Frank'. I'm really upset this isn't a real band, and you can't imagine how blown away I was to learn that the actors legit created and performed this music. I have this longing that I known can't...be fulfilled. Like...I'd love a sequel...but the story is so solid and complete as it is. I highly recommend this for anyone who desires something different. Touching and different. Pure outsider art.<3 <3"
" A Journey
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,9,"First off, I've got to say that this is a masterful performance from Fassbender, even though we can't see his face reactions throughout the movie, we still can feel them, and that its absolutely difficult to do, establishing that he is using a mask-type-thing. Of course he is not alone in the movie, the mix of characters its just perfect, from the almost silent background guitar and drummer players (Francois Civil and Carla Azar respectively), the annoying and crazy Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the nice but just a wee-bit-troubled Don (Scoot McNairy), to the nerdy/ambitious wannabe-a-rock star played by Gleeson, and of course Frank, we got it all. A psychotic but fun bunch of people, different of everything you commonly see, it's the most attractive aspect of the film. Even though the lead actor here is Domnhall, Fassbender performance steals the show, and this is the main factor for this movie. A showing of what ambition could do, to an original thing, something that could wreck everything that you're and purely want. A crazy/dramatic/musical/comedic film, that you must see. (Sorry if there's some grammatical errors, English it's not my main language)"
" Quite odd film in a good way
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,7,"Frank is a relatively unknown and limited released independent film. Starring Domhnall Gleeson (as Jon), an untalented rock-star wannabe, gets a lucky break when, on an English beach, he meets Don (Scoot McNairy), who manages an art-rock band. Furthermore very quickly, Don hires Jon to replace the group's suicidal keyboardist. A gig in Ireland and an album-recording project in a lakeside cabin are on tap.The band is led by Frank (Michael Fassbender wearing a large paper- mache type head mask), whose music reflects mental illness as well as talent and who never takes off his above-mentioned mask. Frank shows kindness and support to Jon, while the other band members tend to dislike him. Also followed by, hostile is theremin player Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who maintains a strong protective (and romantic) interest in Frank. Jon is clueless to Frank's fragility. He also doesn't understand the band's disinterest in commercial success.This film is quite well written and acted well, which is why it is an entertaining watch. Michael Fassbender played as Frank is easily the star and most likable and watchable on screen in this film. The audience is eager to watch whatever he does, and the main reason is with him wearing the mask over his head. The comedy in the film isn't laugh out loud which works here as it is not forced, and more subtle. Frank is relatively short in running time, where they perhaps could have added about 10-15 more minutes, but otherwise the film is quite interesting and unique as it is entertaining."
" Fun, and not as weird as it could have been
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,7,"I wasn't sure what I was going into seeing this movie, but I was delighted at what it ended up being. Mostly.It's a pretty straight forward exploration of creativity, fame, and to some extent mental health. It's not so much about what good music is, but rather how talent evolves, and perhaps how it's more than something inherent in one person. I especially loved their take on the idea of making popular music, and Frank's attitude towards it.I like how they used the ""creative isolation"" aspect of many (real) musicians story in a fictional setting. I can't remember having seen that being done before.All that said, the movie doesn't seem to have much ambition to be more than a fun movie about silly characters. There are touching moments and an arch to many of the characters, but other than some (kind of heavy handed) comments on talent and fame, it's mostly ""just"" a fun ride. I'm not saying that that's bad, but I'm sure there's material enough in the story to take it even further. Especially in developing the relationships between the characters, and the motivations (which at times weren't that believable)."
" Almost Famous
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,3,"Untalented as a songwriter but nevertheless set on making it as a musician, a young Irishman quits his day job to join an eccentric band whose lead singer dons a papier-mâché mask that he never removes in this offbeat drama. Domhnall Gleeson is fine as the milquetoast young protagonist who becomes more and more of an authoritative voice in the band and Michael Fassbender has some solid moments in a mostly voice-only performance as the singer; his observation about normal human faces being a little strange themselves certainly resonates. The talents of the two leads are, however, hardly maximised here. Stories about the rise and falls of bands are a dime a dozen and 'Frank' does little to distinguish itself other than the mask, which soon becomes more of an annoying gimmick than delightful quirk as it distracts from Gleeson's character growth. The music is hardly great either, though the film's weakest area is its supporting characters; it is hard to feel for the band's highs and lows when we only get to know two of them in depth. Then there is the love-hate relationship between Gleeson and Maggie Gyllenhaal which never rings true. Having Gleeson constant tweet about his experiences with his tweets appearing over the action is a further jarring touch that subtracts from the immediacy of the action. Director Lenny Abrahamson would of course later go on to score an Oscar nomination for directing 'Room'. This earlier effort is a strikingly different sort of motion picture at least and may be of interest to those retrospectively exploring his filmmaking origins."
" Weird mysterious masterpiece.
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,8,"A beautiful film, extremely well done body acting by Michael Fassbender and very fun score. I still have the soundtrack and listen to the closing song almost weekly. The score imitates pretentious indie culture music and pokes at the lack of talent it can take to make music. While mockingly pretentious, it is still enjoyable and not *too* artsy fartsy. It's odd characters and dialogue create a mystical quirky feel to it that had me thinking about . Lots of the funny parts are done in the classic dry British humor, mixed with sarcasm. It also had parts that were just childish and fun, and brought out the humour of the entire situation in the plot. Although it plays around with satire and nihilism, it also features some dark moments and messages about suicide and depression, in a very realistic manner.I'd say the movie only falls short in plot progression as it slows towards one part, but otherwise the acting, cinematography, score, and writing are all top notch."
" An odd film guided by pure truths, ""Frank"" is worth the weirdness
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"""Frank"" explores the fine and not-so-fine line between creative genius and insanity. Although you might assume a movie about an alternative rock band with a lead singer who wears a giant fake head that he never takes off would be a work of fiction, the truth, as they say, is stranger, and provides a compelling basis for a movie.""Frank"" is co-written by Jon Ronson based on his experience playing keyboard in the Frank Sidebottom Oh Blimey Big Band in the late '80s. Frank Sidebottom was the alter ego of a man named Chris Sievey, who wore a giant fake head almost identical to the one Frank (Michael Fassbender) wears in the movie. Ronson based the film's main character, Jon (Domhnall Gleeson) on himself; both real and fictional Jon found themselves randomly in this band, ditching their existing lives in pursuit of musical greatness, trying to make sense of the enigma of the man in the giant head.With screenwriter Peter Straughan's (""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"") help, Ronson dives into a fictional replication of his experience with the band. Gleeson's Jon is an aspiring songwriter completely lacking in inspiration who gets an unusual opportunity to play a gig for an experimental band called Soronprfbs after he witnesses their keyboardist attempting to drown himself. Jon has the time of his life and agrees to travel to Ireland with the group, only to discover it's not a road trip to play a few shows, but a retreat at which the unorthodox Frank will stop at nothing until he's recorded an astounding new album.For all the mystery shrouding his character, Frank is far from the most eccentric band member. In fact, he's the most congenial. We also learn about the other keyboardist, Don's (Scoot McNairy), volatile history with mental illness and musician Clara's (Maggie Gyllenhaal) propensity for violence. Unsurprisingly, Jon's gleaning from it all is that deep adversity and mental anguish is a pre- requisite to talent.Director Lenny Abrahamson brings a natural yet surreal quality that honors the weirdness of the story, while also helping us access the psychology of the characters and take interest in what's happening in a very rooted way. He keeps the reality of what's going on with its characters in play while experimenting with a number of scenes that push the bizarreness to varying levels. There are elements of black comedy, but also of honest, soul-stirring truth.The first half of ""Frank"" focuses more on the creative process and the mental headspace necessary to operate at peak creativity. When Jon signs them up for a very promising gig and begins pushing his own creative agenda, forcing the story to leave the confines of the Ireland vacation home, the film turns to examine the real pain of its characters and what happens to creativity when complications of fandom and notoriety enter the mix.Throughout it all we see a gradual change in Jon as a character, and he becomes less likable because of all that his dreams and naiveté have wrought. This has a slightly adverse effect on the viewing experience, making it kind of painful to watch all these troubled characters with their misguided attitudes drown themselves in a sea of expectations and principles. At the same time, this leads to an honest, moving redemptive arc in the final half hour of the movie, when this bizarre flower of a story opens up to reveal its fragile insides.""Frank"" can feel rough and disjointed tonally at points and grow a little irksome, but much like how a band with a weird sound still has artistic integrity somewhere underneath that drives that creative choice, ""Frank"" stays committed to looking at talent, creativity and mental illness in a very authentic, productive way that makes it worth the quirks.~Steven CThanks for reading!
