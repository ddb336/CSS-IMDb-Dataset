" Stop-motion animation > Others
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"The perfect metaphor for Nazi EuropeGenuinely such a goodAnother delightful film from the creators of ParaNorman, the whimsical Boxtrolls is another stop-motion treasure that plays just as well for children as it does adults. The fanciful world follows the industrious title creatures that have wrongly been demonized as villains. Snatcher (a tremendous Ben Kingsley) has much to gain by stirring up boxtroll fears, and if he captures them all he'll finally be allowed to join the town's inner circle of muckity mucks. We follow ""Eggs"" a boy who has been raised by the boxtrolls since he was a baby and his re-emergence with the world above ground, notably with the help of a morbid little girl, Winnie (Elle Fanning). The world building is confident and well developed, the storyline finds nuanced ways to be touching and deliver serious messages about peer pressure, assimilation, and the ways which we judge ourselves and whether those are even of merit. But the main draw is the glorious animation, so fluid, so lively, and a landscape that makes full use of color and light and shadow. It's an immersive experience that your eyes don't want to blink for fear of missing something. The plot is droll and expertly sequenced with its variety of character and comic asides. The vocal cast does a terrific job, notably Kingsley and a hilarious Tracy Morgan. The film can get a little spooky for young children but should still be comfortable viewing. The Boxtrolls is further proof that the animation house Laika is operating at near-Pixar peak levels of brilliance and deserve the benefit of the doubt with any future films."
" Much better than the box office would indicate
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,8,Laika is a great studio. It is sad that each film they've put out has had a lower box office total than the one before.Coraline was a good film. Paranorman was a terrific film. This was really good. Kubo and the Two Strings was also excellent. But they don't make money.
" Dark, Dull, Creepy and Not fun
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,1,"This really doesn't seem like a kids movie. It is just too dark and dull. Definitely not a loveable movie, I rented it, but wished I hadn't. Rather grotesque really, but to each their own."
" This is a great movie
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,10,"The Boxtrolls is one of the best movies I have ever seen. To me, I don't really believe there is anything more I need to add or justify about the movie or my opinion. Great animation, great message. The moment the movie finished I didn't um or ahh, I just said 'what a great movie.'"
" An average film in my eyes
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,6,"'The Boxtrolls' has parts that I like, but overall I found it slow-moving.I enjoyed the Boxtrolls themselves, I like how they look and come across. Archibald (Ben Kingsley) and bodyguards, Messrs Trout (Nick Frost) and Pickles (Richard Ayoade), are good, as is the casting of Jared Harris as Lord Charles Portley-Rind.With that said, I liked them individually rather than as a group. Frost and Ayoade being the key examples, despite being two of the same character I never felt a connection between them. Elsewhere, I rate Isaac Hempstead Wright and Elle Fanning as actors, but I don't feel like their voices suit the respective roles of Eggs and Winnie.The stop-motion animation is strong, but I just feel the plot is brought to life in a sluggish manner; the ending particularly felt dragged out to me. All in all, it's an average film in my eyes."
" Underrated
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,9,I like both the screenplay and the visuality. I think that it's score is underrated.
" Beautiful
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,9,"Movie was really amazing, storyline was amazing and was on right track all over the movie, animation was really great.. really loveable movie, especially for kids. Kids would love it, although totally recommended for any age, just watch itðŸ˜‰"
" Awful, poorly written, transphobic mess.
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,1,Not much to recommend here. Skip it and watch something else.
" Oddball film
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,7,"This film is an odd portrayal of underground creatures living in Victorian England. The visual style is definitely unique but not for everyone as it is a bit dark and grotesque. The story was engaging, the action was riveting, the characters were funny and there was a lot of work put into the visuals."

" Troll it at your peril.
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,8,"I didn't go into this with a lot of optimism; something about the title, the premise, the look and its lacklustre prologue (complete with some heavy handed class culture subtext on those blasted hats).But this turned out to be a charming adventure once it had sort of written into itself with a quaint aesthetic while still being au courant. It makes no secret of being one of those ""humanity is the real monster"" narratives and makes a poignant story of belonging and discovering a new world.The real heart of the movie is the boy (oh my god I hate his name...) and his relationship with the lovely Winifred. Writing these boy/girl movie relationships can be tricky. You don't want to fail into the old gender stereotypes but at the same time you don't want to seem pandering and sanctimonious. She is a delightful creature that mixes beautiful little girl with a ghoulish soul. She is neither the gate keeper of morality and etiquette nor a strange to it since she is the one from the upper crust so of course she is the one telling the boy how to behave at a social function. Seriously: I love Winifred.And of course visually captivating but I don't know how to say much about that.A real winner from the Laika team but this habit of showing themselves animating is getting tired. One more time and it will feel self-indulgent."
" looks great but no story
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,5,"This is beautifully made but it goes to show that you can't do much without a story: what there is of it is wearisomely stale and hackneyed. The film is also far too long. Arguably the best bit is the end credits, where two characters discuss the possibility they might only be animated figures..."
" Don't let your kids see this film
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,1,This is a horror film for kids. Eating children. Killing. Torture. Made for grownups.
" The Boxtrolls
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,1,The imagery in this film is my main issue- it's nauseating and steals appetites.
" Ugly character makes the animation unwatchable.
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,2,"The Boxtrolls animation is really very difficult to review, because it's kind of not good. The animation is really bad. The characters are really ugly and the story is not that good. So, it turned out to be not very good animation.If I have to watch this animation, I rather choose the other animation(s) because this one is not worth watching. Some people might think this animation is a good one. As for me, it's really bad. If you want to see some cute animation and sweet story, don't ever watch this animation."
" Very artistic but not for small children
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie in 2019, five years after its release and I must admit I was sorry it took me so long.Very clever, nice combination of stop motion and 3D. Small children will probably miss a lot but adults will certainly enjoy it."
" Quick Review
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,6,"""The Boxtrolls"" have a charm in them, that is for sure. Also a guarantee is the artistic flair of the Stop-Motion animation provided, always, by Laika.The biggest problem with the movie lies in the choices of the screenplay. Although, there are some great messages about life in general and being open to any differences people out there have, there hasn't been enough effort for any of the above to flourish. Things are easily jump for point A to point B, but they are doing so pretty obviously and so any magic of the story is lost.I can say that i recommend this one to everyone, mostly due to its animation, rather than the story it depicted."
" Enjoyably weird
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,7,"The Boxtrolls may be Laika's weakest movie, but they deliver visually impressive movies with lots of creative effort put into them every time.This is the kind of movie you have to see to believe. Yes, the central plot may be predictable, but the world it is set in is so enjoyably weird that you can't help smiling.Aside from the imaginative world, we get a handful of characters who, honestly, are a mixed bag. Our main character, Eggs, started off promising as an abducted baby raised by the boxtrolls with whom he builds fun gadgets from junk found in the streets above.But an evil exterminator, Snatcher, has sworn to rid the town of the trolls to get a position among the higher-ups. He is so enjoyably evil and brought to life magnificently by Ben Kingsley who gave his all to secure him a place as the most memorable character in the movie.I say that, because after we get acqainted with the other main character Winnie, we end up with a fish-out-of-water story in which Eggs must reveal Snatcher's plan to save the his troll family. Not a terrible plot, but seen before. That mixed up with mostly forgettable characters with Snatcher being the exception dragged the movie down a notch.Again, still worth watching just for the animation and Snatcher!"
" The animation alone makes it worth watching.
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,7,"The Boxtrolls is a unique movie. The animation alone makes it worth watching. It's not as humorous as other animated features, but it has a certain cleverness throughout the movie. The voice acting is also well done - the actors must have had a fun time doing it. This is a simple story that kids and parents can enjoy."
" Glad I didn't see this when I was a kid
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,4,"Threats of horrible death and dismemberment, grotesque figures, insanity and confusion. It seems almost sadistic at times. How much can we scar the children?As an adult I hoped that the upper-class ignorant who caused all these traumatic events by maintaining evil, would also be suitably punished, but he's a father and therefore safe from harm."
" Wonderful movie!
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,10,A wonderful movie. Great storyline. My children and I enjoyed it very much.
" Nothing groundbreaking but a nice story
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,7,"I did not catch Boxtrolls when it was in theaters, but I did rent it without any expectations and enjoyed it. Stop motion animation and clever characters, plus relatable themes all combined for a neat little package. And a lot of good voices too, some from old TV shows. It may be a little scary for the youngsters but I got over my fears of movie monsters years ago and I still liked the movie. It didn't scare me at all. It's like one of those paintings with weird and unusual creatures dominating center stage. Now that it's 2018 I don't know if I remember a lot. But it was fun!"
" Say ""cheese"".
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,6,"'The Boxtrolls (2014)' is Laika's weakest effort, for sure. It tries to do a lot thematically, but it never quite manages to do it all that well, remaining a rather broad and distant affair throughout. Still, it's beautifully animated and, at times, charmingly off-beat. It certainly skews slightly younger than the studio's other flicks but it still retains its own edge, which allows it to sit comfortably in the realm of family entertainment as opposed to entirely childish fare. The story itself is quite contrived, though, and it's oddly structured and paced, to boot. Yet, it does take a couple of risks which pay off pretty well, thanks to an underlying, pseudo allegorical darkness. This isn't quite as apparent what's seen in 'Coraline (2009)', 'ParaNorman (2012)' or, even, 'Kubo And The Two Strings (2016)' but it's undeniably present - at least, in part. Generally, the flick dares to go deeper than most films of the kind and, as such, tells a relatively nuanced and occasionally exciting tale. However, it's never really emotionally affecting - or, even, compelling - and this is its main issue. The decently daring themes and sporadically successful set-pieces don't have the impact they should because you don't really care about the people involved with them. Plus, it seems strange that a key character has to literally call out the (fairly obvious) central thesis of the piece multiple times. To be fair, this is above average stuff that would probably seem better if it didn't come from such an acclaimed studio. It isn't up to Laika's self-set standards, though, which makes it quite a disappointment. Of course, its aesthetic is as amazing as you'd expect. This alone should carry you through the entirety of the swiftly moving piece. Even if the flick may not affect you emotionally, it will probably make you smile once or twice. 6/10"
" I guess its watchable.
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,6,"This movie is somewhat entertaining, but not something that I'd go out of my way to recommend. There is a lot of bad dialogue and plot devices in this thing. The animation is fantastic though, so there's that. Its not enough for me to watch it again."
" The Boxtrolls is Laika's weakest animation, but still an enjoyable flick.
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,7,"When I say it's the weakest, it's not a negative remark because Laika have been pumping out consistently good animations that are enjoyable for everyone. This is no different, it's just up against a strong canon. As the title suggests, this is all about Boxtrolls. Mischievous crafty little creatures that hide themselves underground...and dress in boxes...and each are named after their boxed contents such as Fish...Eggs...Shoe...and I think at one point we had Oil? Once again, completely imaginative and that is really where the enjoyment comes from, the creativity was utilised to its maximum potential. A town living in fear of Boxtrolls where a cheese enthusiast employs the assistance of a wannabe cheese enthusiast, who is allergic to cheese, to exterminate them so that he can enjoy cheese in the royal cheese tasting room. Did I mention that cheese was involved? It's bonkers. Our villain is villainous because he wants to wear a white hat. ALL of this, for a white hat. Just...just beautiful. Obviously conveying the point of just being yourself no matter your background or materialistic ambitions. I always appreciate stop motion animation, it's such a time consuming craft that really conveys the creator's inventiveness well. There are moments where computer animation intertwines with the stop motion, and unfortunately is noticeable, but for the most part looks stunning. The voice acting was spot on!! I could not believe that Snatcher was voice by Ben Kingsley, ridiculously good! Jared Harris and Richard Ayoade were also noteworthy and brought life into their characters. Some of these characters are not as fleshed out as I would like, but are certainly memorable. From a miniature henchman who captures Boxtrolls like The Terminator to Snatcher's burlesque alter ego Madame Frou Frou. Plenty of funny moments as well, I thought the script was well rounded and easily appeals to both children and adults. The story is somewhat basic but Laika utilised imagination to the max and it paid off."
" A simple, but cute film.
",2018-01-09 00:00:00,8,"Ever since Laika came into the spotlight in 2009, they have crafted some fantastic stop motion animated movies starting with ""Coraline"". The movies which are technically crafted by hand are brought to life with the use of photography and careful movement of puppets which I have always loved seeing. Now, we have the next movie from the studio known as ""The Boxtrolls"". It's an impressive looking movie with many cute moments, but maybe it's a little too cute and simple for audiences tastes especially considering the other animated movies that came out the year it came out. Want to know why? Well, I'll explain.In the hill topped village known as Cheesebridge, the antagonistic Archibald Snatcher (Ben Kingsley) has been trying to hunt and exterminate the trolls in the city known as the box trolls (the reason is because they wear cardboard boxes) after they have kidnapped and supposedly killed a baby in hopes to join the elite group known as the White Hats so he can try the many cheeses they taste despite being lactose intolerant. The trolls in reality have raised the baby boy known as Eggs (Isaac Hempstead Wright) has lived in secret with the trolls helping top protect them from the exterminators and turning discarded objects into creative inventions. Years go by and Eggs has continued to live with the trolls when he is discovered by the daughter of the leader of Cheesebridge, Winnie (Elle Fanning). Disgusted by the way the town sees the trolls, Eggs tries to convince Winnie to see the reality of the trolls and free them from the evil Archibald Snatcher. I think you can figure out the rest from there.Though I did enjoy the film, I did have some problems that may make some people a little disappointed. The story of the film is a nice and simple story, it isn't as big as Laika's previous movies . I remember how huge a movie like ""Coraline"" was especially with it's climax and comparing it with this film did make me wish that there should have been more to it. Even the ending of this film was a little anticlimactic in a way. As for the animation, it's once again fantastic. I really appreciate the time and effort that the artists went into creating the details of the film. The village in particular was very impressive. I loved how huge it was and how much tiny details were added into it. Even the character animation was very smooth and felt perfect. Now, how are the characters? Pretty good. I liked how cute the boxtrolls were, thought Archibald Snatcher was a great villain brought to life by a fantastic performance by Ben Kingsley, and really liked the attitude that Elle Fanning brought to Winnie. As for Eggs, he could have been a better main character. I thought he was pretty bland at times and should have been written a little better at times. He wasn't a bad character, but he just wasn't very memorable. I think that was about it.""The Boxtrolls"" is definitely a very cute movie with a decent simple story, fantastic animation, and some mostly good characters. I don't think it's up there with Laika's best movies as I do think this is there weakest effort to date though I can easily say that the movie is nowhere near awful. It's was a very nice movie and it's easily something I can watch again."
" An interesting idea
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,9,"In a fantastic world where cheese is the most valuable thing, the inhabitants have a big problem. They must hide in their houses at night because of some awkward creatures which roam the streets and steal all sorts of objects. Among them, happens to be a kid which thinks he's one of them, who's about to find some disturbing truths and, of course, do something about the situation.It's a beautiful and original stop-motion animation which features some cute and funny creatures, which, only on their own are a recipe for success, let alone in a full movie like this one. It tells a pretty interesting story which describes the emotional adventures of a boy, struggling to adapt and make people realize the truth that's been standing right in front of them for a very long time.It's interesting and a pleasant watch but unfortunately there is nothing groundbreaking or impressive about it. It's a very good animation, but pretty far from ""The Big Ones""."
" Dark and funny; another delight from Studio Laika
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,9,"In the town of Cheesebridge to citizens live in fear of the sewer-dwelling Boxtrolls who emerge at night and reportedly took and devoured a baby! Archibald Snatcher offers to catch and exterminate the monsters in exchange for a place on the town council so he can eat fine cheese and converse with the upper echelons of Cheesebridge society. It turns out that the stories about the Boxtrolls are untrue; far from eating the baby they raised him as one of their own; now known as Eggs he thinks he is a Boxtroll. One night he is seen Winnie, the daughter of city leader Lord Portley-Rind, who is fascinated with the Boxtrolls and the horrible things they are rumoured to do. After Egg's friend, Fish, is captured he returns to the surface and is shocked to learn what the people think about the Boxtrolls; he approaches Winnie to ask where Snatcher takes the captured trolls. He manages to rescue Fish and learns a shocking truth about Snatcher; if he is to save his friends he will have to work with Winnie and the Boxtrolls to defeat Snatcher.As with other films from Laika this film has some delightfully dark momentsÂ… Winnie's theories about what Boxtrolls do to people are particularly gruesome and there are some scary moments might scare younger children. Older children and adult viewers should really enjoy it though. The Boxtrolls are strangely endearing and the villain is delightfully grotesqueÂ… and gets worse when he eats the cheese he so desperately craves. There are times when it looks as if something bad happens to characters we are meant to like but in each case we later learn they are okay. Not surprisingly the stop-go animation is very good and the setting is beautifully realised with a really grungy look and some nice steampunk features. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of Laika's other films or of animated features in general."
" Deserving of higher praise and ratings
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,7,"The undergrounds of Cheesebridge are the Boxtrolls' home. They are tiny odd gray beings with onomatopoeic language, who use grocery boxes as a dress, and live from collecting metal junk at night. They are considered baby snatchers, but they are very loving creatures; in fact, they've raised human baby 'Eggs'. Their life and future existence is threatened by the ugly, nasty, cheese-allergic, drag-queeny Archibald Snatcher and his two wicked assistants Mr Trout & Mr Pickles. Snatcher wants to exterminate the Boxtrolls ASAP to obtain a white hat and become part of the Town Council, as he dreams of respectability and of sharing the Council's cheese tasting sessions and discussions. Winnie, the Major Lord Portley-Rind's neglected daughter, meets Eggs by chance one night and, together, they start an adventure to try to rescue the fast-disappearing Boxtrolls and to expose Snatcher's wickedness and lies to the town.The Boxtrolls is one of my favorite stop-motion animated films of the last years even though it is not that popular, or that well-known, or it wasn't that much of a hit when it first came out. It has everything to please both children and adults and entertain them both. Based upon Alan Snow's 'Here Be Monsters', the film feels like one of those old European tales we all love, mixed with some Burton-ish imagery and a cute sprinkle of the Minions.The film has a great visual style, is utterly funny and entertaining, has a great tempo and, most importantly, has great anti-hero heroes and despicable villains. It is perfect for adults because it has great dialogues and is witty, but it has lots of adventure and charm, and is tender and sweet at times.The production design is incredible, and the micro-expressions of some of the leading characters are amazing, especially Eggs', who feels real as real it can be. The actors are really well cast for their roles, especially Isaac Hempstead Wright as Eggs, Ben Kingsley as Snatcher, Richard Ayoade as Mr Pickles, Nick Frost as Mr Trout, and Jared Harris as Lord Portley-Rind. I thought that they were all brilliant at voicing their characters. The rest of the cast were also very good.Give the Boxtrolls a chance to entertain you."
