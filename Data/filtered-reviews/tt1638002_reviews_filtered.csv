" Really great Romantic Comedy about boy-girl friendships
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,8,I really did feel like time went by and felt a relatability to the plot and the characters. This is truly a great watch and Ill most definitely watch it again in the future. The chemistry and dialogue between Rosie and Alex UNBELIEVABLY GREAT!! And you truly feel like they both know that they like each other but are friends and friends don't like each other. You can really feel in some scenes how hard is for them to be friends and nothing more.
" Oh my god.
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,9,"8 Freaking times. * freaking times I completely lost control and broke down. The beginning really scammed me and made me think this is going to be a cliche love triangle but Oh my goodness, the expected was completely unexpected. I tore down several times and I still can't jump over how they managed that.Film, scenery, acting amazing. 100% recommend if you're a fan of drama/romance. The only thing I'd complain about how they played with my feelings so easily. Like calm down.But yeah, I reallllyyyy felt the character's emotions, as if I were in their shoes, broke me sixty billion times. Very nice."
" I am in love with this movie
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,I love this movie. It has an amazing storie and I love the relationship between these two. The story shows that true love and destiny exist which is beautiful. Apart I love Lily Collins and Sam Claflin.
" Love this movie
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,10,I first watched this movie a couple of years ago and I loved it so much. I can't really relate to this people but it's really raw and shows that it doesn't always work out immediately. This is now my favourite movie. Sam Claffin and Lili Collins have a lot of chemistry and are amazing actors. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
" Painfully boring and unrealistic.
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,1,"I'm just so angry at the way of this movie played out, I kept thinking it would get more interesting or better. Instead I just got more irritated minutes after minutes. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Unless, you're the type of person to find any corny lame romantic movie cute."
" One of my fav rom-com!
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Yeh, right. It was underrated! I even wanted it to be 11/10.
Well, I admit that the prefect casting has already won my heart and taken up maybe 7/10 lol. Sam Claflin and Lily Collins are so good together and they should win the Best Onscreen Couple in Hum. And the rest of the 3/10 is according to some credible reasons why you should go watch it immediately if you are wondering if it is good.
First, do not like over-twisted plot throughout the storyline cuz we search for rom-coms with predictable content and happy ending.
Secondly, a charming axis of time makes all these things even more fascinating. We watched them grew up, became mature, had family and partners while continually loving, and cherishing each other, till they finally revealed their hearts and came together, which they've been waiting and pretending for soooo long. Which "" Better late than never"" by Rosie in the last scene couldn't be more aptly quoted.
Lastly, what else could be more romantic than best friends turned out to be lovers together? When you fall for your best friend but in the wrong timing, you feel like the luckiest yet the most unfortunate. That's why this movie is always haunting.
I loved the wedding scene that Rosie said: ""Because sometimes you don't see that the best thing that has ever happened to you is sitting there, right under your nose. But that's fine too. It really is. Because I've realized that no matter where you are, or what you're doing, or who you're with, I'll always honestly, truly, completely, love you."" ""I will always stand guard over your dream, Alex. No matter how weird or twisted they get."" I cried everytime I watched."
" Love and life
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,9,"I loved it. Despite that it's not something new and that it was relatively predictable, I loved it. And I loved the two leading actors, very amiable, beautiful and great chemistry between them. The movie is based in real life. Sometimes life gets in the way of true love. Sometimes we make choices based on the current circumstances. But true love never ends."
" Worth watching
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,9,"Love, Rosie was a very nicely directed and written romantic story. The ending wasn't expected. I was like ""okay, let's accept the bitter truth and move on "" but the last scene really revived the hope and made it into a reality (obviously, in the reels).
I don't think any scene was unnecessary, everything was very much smooth and connected."
" Enjoyable predictability
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Familiar story beats that just work!A coming of age tale with realistic moments of pressure and pain that face us all in time. All handled with good moments of strength and humour.I like the way values are articulated and the way morality is derived into the action-drama rather than in long dialogue like others attempt.I didn't think you needed to portray Rosie as the sleeping around type after her quick maturity into motherhood. It kind of ruined the character arc.The musical score take the high pitched emotional sequences to another level.'Will you marry me? Yes. WHAT! It can't be that easy""Plenty of great subtext let down by an abrupt ending that ran out of ideas.Good Film"
" Idk what to say!
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie made me fall in love again!
This could probably be one of the best (romantic) movies I've ever seen!
In love with this movie.💞
They were meant to be with each other!🥀"
" JUST WATCH
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,10,Best RomCom ever.Great story and lovely ending. It's a joyfull movie to see with your loved one.
" Awesome Romcom
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,9,"Firstly, Lily and Sam were perfect as Rosie and Alex- so much chemistry. This movie demonstrates how things can turn out when people don't say how that feel, but also that sometimes people need to take certain paths and learn things along the way before they see what they really want. Perhaps, if Rosie and Sam realised they were in love as teenagers and began a relationship, they may not have lasted as they had not yet lived. It's about choices and growth. This movie may have been a little predictable but it's a Romcom! I really enjoyed it and I am not ashamed to admit I had a little 😥(perhaps big😭) cry at the end. Love is beautiful and Rosie and Alex were certainly in love. Just gorgeous 💞"
" Charming actors, but...
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,1,"This is not rom-com in any sense, just plain dry drama. It's so convenient all other characters cheat."
" Weak Four Weddings and a Funeral wannabe
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,5,Even including a quirky short haired red head side character. This was all just a little off. But ok for a rainy Sunday afternoon.
" I cried
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,This is everyone's love story!! Ofcourse there's a 50/50 change something like this actual happen.. but I cried
" Happiness is not far away, but it's not easy to find it.
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,9,"""Love, Rosie"" is a comedy and romantic movie which gets 7.2 points on the IMDB. It starts at two children, Rosie and Alex, the main roles in the movie. The first screen is that they played together then grew up and graduated from the same senior high school. They are just like the childhood sweetheart.
Rosie and Alex have known each other since they're children. There go to school together. They study in the same elementary school, junior high school, and the senior high school. They hope that they can go to the same college, too. When they graduate from the senior high school, their school have a party that the graduate will attend in pairs. Rosie goes with Greg, the sunshine boy I'm school. Alex goes with Bethany, the perfect girl in school. The reason that they don't go each other is Rosie forgets that Alex kisses her before. Then Alex thinks that maybe Rosie doesn't like him, so he finds the perfect girl, Bethany. He thinks maybe this way can help him forgets Rosie.
After many years, Rosie finds out that her true love is Alex, but Alex is going to have a wedding with Bethany. She doesn't want to miss him again, so she takes a plane to Alex's wedding. She tries to tell Alex that how much love she loves him.
In this movie, I realize that happiness is not far away, but it's not easy to find it. However, it""s close to you, it's still hard to notice it. Then you""ll just pass it. Just like the movie, Rosie and Alex."
" Bad
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,4,Bad bad bad desperate terrible script writing no chemistry boring painful to go through
" Too many accidents
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,7,"Chemistry, check. Romance, check. Comedy, check. Good acting, check. However, the story relies too much on accidents. A couple breaks up because of coincidental mistake and makes up with little explanation. You can say that is what all rom-com should be about. However, Rosie's action does not persuade the audience, so it's hard to keep up with her emotions and actions. Rather than feeling it with her, I keep asking myself 'why did she make that decision?' and try to reason with her with some EFFORTS."
" Best friends turned lovers
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,9,Maybe it's a predictable one but the cinematography and superb soundtrack makes the movie so special. Lily Collins is the most important reason why you should see this movie. It's a perfect collision of romance with comedy. It's a movie with some real stuff i.e. it shows how hard and yet beautiful friendship turned love can be.
" my opinion
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,9,The movie was very fun. All sentiments are inside. The end is really beautiful
" A lovely movie!
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,8,"This is one of my favorite romantic comedy movies, it's cute yet funny at the same times. I love the characters as I thought both have given a strong chemistry, it really got me in tears when I watched it. It's worth to watch❣"
" Immy's review : One of the best rom-coms
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,9,"A charming movie about two best friends concealed love for each other over the years, and the different paths they take in pursuit of their dreams. Love, Rosie is one of my all time favourite rom coms due to its colourful plot, excellent chemistry between the two leads, and it's versatile and well developed characters. It's a delightfully warm and heartfelt film based around our inability to communicate our feelings and always getting the timing wrong, consequently leading Rosie and Alex on a tumultuous 10 year journey of missed opportunities, heartache and regret, whilst each creating a life for themselves that neither of them expected. Sam Claflin and Lily Collins had incredible chemistry and a heartwarming dynamic together, making the film all the more poignant when they ended up with somebody else. It was so lovely how they always found a way back to each other, despite the unflattering circumstances, strongly conveying to us that they were only meant for each other. The film gave us a glimpse of the two characters lives throughout the years and how it contrasted with their dreams ; Rosie raising a child as a single mother thus halting any plans for university, however realises she's happy with what she has even if it isn't part of her plans. And Alex, who despite having the seemingly perfect life and career as he had planned, was blatantly miserable and it is apparent that his success and 'perfect' girlfriend is all a cover up for how he truly feels for Rosie. It's for this reason this film is so much more than just a typical rom com, as it looks in depth at how their lives are remarkably different and how each others absence in their lives impacts their decisions, as despite both seeming happy, there is still something missing. I also love how the movie focuses on the lack of communication and masking how we feel, consequently making both Alex and Rosie see something that's not there and thinking that the other is happy without them, (which is obviously not the case). The soundtrack was vibrant, warm and lively, with every song connecting well with each scene and associated emotion. Lastly, the screenplay was sharp and clever, delivering some laugh out loud worthy lines, as well as the occasional tear or two. Overall, a heartfelt and lovely little movie that is in my opinion severely underrated. Highly recommend!"
" Okay, watchable.
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,4,"Love Rosie has the characters and fine acting, but a brutal plot.So much unnecessary drama and nothing deep or funny to raise it above mediocrity. A simple phone call could have prevented a lot. The moments where she's with her daughter, handcuffed to the bed etc, that's where it should have stayed."
" Nothing new.
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,4,"When I started watching the movie, I thought it was going to be a solid 7 stars. The characters were cute. Acting was good. Their chemistry was great and I do love the friends to lovers trope. I liked how they talked about not giving up on your dreams when life throws you curveballs and not feeling like your life is over because you had to pause to raise a child.But the longer the movie went on the lower my rating started getting. The plot was getting repetitive and cliched. They kept going round in circles.Also I absolutely hate it when in romances they do this thing where everyone else the leads date except for the other lead has to be bad. Like a liar or a cheater or a narcissist you name it, just so you can root for the leads to get together instead. You shouldn't have to do that, you should be able to give us a reason to root for the leads that isn't 'everyone else bad'. Imagine how much more interesting it would have been if the other people they married were actually great people. Who do they pick now?And i stopped believing in their chemistry when we would jump over years of time where they didn't speak to each other. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever watched, I did watch all of it. I'm just disappointed in it because I was expecting more."
" Good
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,7,"A cliché done well. Perhaps the ending could've been a little bit better, but still a good movie"
" I love Love Rosie
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,8,"Seeing this film a few years ago, I was super keen to watch it again. Even second time round it doesn't disappoint. It has to be up there as one of the most frustrating romance stories of a couple trying to get together, but the timing never really working out. It makes you realise how good the timing has been in your own relationships, or maybe not for everyone. But frustration is worth it in the end for a satisfying pay off, seeing Sam Clafin walk in the hotel you can't help but be ecstatic! This movie feels very real in that it moves quickly - not as quickly as the book where they don't get together for way longer. But the fact the Rosie has a kid, they move cities, move jobs all seems quite realistic. Where as other romance movies often take the approach of everything working out within a year or less. This movie confronts its characters with problem after problem and they are constantly faced with coming up with solutions. Many of which don't work. This is something that the audience can always relate to, because we all have problems and things don't work out. There's excellent chemistry between Sam and Lily, they were cast very well and this has to easily be one of my favourite romance movies!"
" Not Bad😁
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,7,"I won't tell that this is a Good Romantic movie But it was OK. Had my time passed. Not A Remarkable one like ""Forever My Girl"" Or ""Titanic""."
" love
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,7,"The greatest feeling is that you must express your true feelings, two people to communicate, hidden in the heart of the words may not come out can only move themselves."
" love
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,8,"Sometimes love is not necessary, but we do yearn for someone who can understand you, tolerate you, support your dreams and, importantly, truly love you."
" Love This Movie
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,6,Sam Claflin crushes it again in this one with Lily Collins as performing through Rosie and Alex.These movie was great and I enjoyed every second of it.There is one sharp emotional turn after another.
" Thoughts
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,7,"Here for saaam love lille too
There's something in the story doses not seem right for me but i loved the vibes tho
Best friends love
I was shocked when Rosie got pregnant like i did not expect this to happen it changed the whole storyline."
" Quite like it
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,8,"A movie for all ages, definately. I though it would be like so dramatic but turn out it quite light. Overall it good."
" It was super great
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,10,I think it's been a long time since I've seen a movie with this color. The two actors' acting and the movie's message to the viewers caused me a lot of empathy.
" Bit cliche but a solid feel good chick flick
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,8,"A few corny parts, a few cliche parts, but still pulls at your heartstrings, especially towards the end"
" so romantic
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,9,I enjoy this romantic movie. love the end. And the leading actor is so handsome.
" Would Recommend to Anyone Who Likes Romantic Films
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,5,"It's an enjoyable story, but it ultimately lacks both craft and nuance. While they do a good job of making the leads likeably messed up, all the side characters are caricatures and all the partners of the leads are so cartoonishly awful that the audience can't help but wondee how the failed relationships, which all progressed offscreen or in montage, could ever become so serious. The themes are interesting, but the film repeatedly has the characters state them explicitly rather than letting them shine through the story naturally. However, if you like romantic films, I would recommend as it is an interesting (if flawed) take on the genre that says something worth saying."
" Lost count of the rewatches (but I still suggest you read the book)
",2020-03-21 00:00:00,10,"Timing is everything.I've been a fan of ""Where rainbows end"" that the movie is based on since 2010 and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that someone's finally turning it into a movie. My relationship with it changed over time: on the first try I would've rated it a 7 because it departs from the book I adore sooooo much (why do that to Ruby and Greg?), on the third rewatch I thought okay maybe a 9 because the ending actually makes me much happier that the original, on the eeehm sixth review (I've lost count by now) I knew it's a 10/10 forever.
That's because this movie is so life-asserting and hopeful - wouldn't you love to know that even after all the mistakes you've made and all the times you got the timing wrong, if you work on it, you can power through and get the happy ending you truly deserve. And actors are amazing, that's exactly how I pictured Alex! The music is great too.All in all, I have no idea who would give this movie a negative review, it's great and you'll definitely love it!"
" Perfect love story
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,10,"This film is filled with ups and downs, laughter and tears. Above all- really great acting!"
" Not a RomCom
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,3,"Lily Collins is an utter delight and the best part of this movie.I don't typically write reviews, but this was such a disappointment that I felt compelled. It's not a 'romcom' because there's no 'com' and very little 'rom'. They tried to add the usual misunderstanding/mistiming but failed miserably in the execution of screenwriting, directing and editing so the whole thing is clumsy and the opposite of charming. I love romcoms. This was crap."
" I couldn't finish it
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,4,"Yes, the men are gorgeous; what else is new? Of course they get divorces because of affairs and having completely opposite personalities and turbulent relationships. What REALLY got me is that the mother and teenage daughter could be best friends because they look so close in age. I know that happens in real life, but it's not really supposed to happen in a movie. I stopped believing the storyline at that point. The pink-haired best friend was definitely my favorite."
" Cute, romantic, easy watch, feel good, romantic
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this movie, it's one for when you don't want to think too much! Not everyone's cup of tea but it was mine!"
" Painfully Frustrating
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,2,"Spoiler alertIt feels like a 12 year old wrote this script.I do however love Lily Collins and her acting in this movie, so my criticism is wholly towards the writers.This movie is so unbelievably unrealistic and removed from reality it is mind- boggling. There are 4 major life events between this couple where they each CHOOSE someone or something that brings them further away from each other. But if the idiotic choices of these people who apparently ache to be together wasn't enough, it is equally annoying the way these huge life decisions just conveniently get tossed to the wayside as if they didn't happen.I mean how many times in one movie can both people marry the person they don't love, or have a child with the person they don't love, and then every time  the bad relationship unravels because the partner cheated. I mean come on! Come on! What?? How are people giving this a 10 star? There are zero stakes in this movie. Even the climactic ending had very little effect on me, because he's now married to another woman! Does that mean nothing? The conclusion of their 12 year supposed romance is a weekend hotel fling?? Did he just annul the marriage and forget to mention it? Another huge life decision zapped away by bad writing.This is why I love Jane Eyre over most chick flicks today. When Rochester proposes she stay with him despite being married, most chick flick leads just melt, as if the offer is enough. But not Jane Eyre. She turns down the love of her life for SELF RESPECT!Ladies, choices matter! To me, it's a self respect sin to give everything to someone who has you as their weekend fling. It does not matter what they say, or how they make you feel. That's all garbage if you're not the one they're going home to at the end of the day and giving everything for."
" It seems cliché but not...
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,8,"The story melted my heart and I finished with tears on my eyes, true and pure love is good shown also the soundtrack is incredible."
" Really enjoyed this movie
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this cute little movie about best friends since childhood who secretly like one another, but never has the guts to tell one another how they feel. The story spans over twelve years of their lives from high school to their late twenties. Others say this movie is unrealistic or farfetched. I think this movie hit a nerve with some females, because females have an automatically understood girl code that you shouldn't try to take another woman's man even if the woman is narcissistic or not the kindest person. So the fact that in one scene Rosie declares her love for Sam at his wedding reception, hit them the wrong way.Sam and Rosie's relationship is a series of missed opportunities like wanting to go to the dance together and Sam goes out with Bethany since Rosie acts like she's not into him and then mocks Sam for being a virgin. And Rosie goes out with another guy because Sam told her Bethany wanted to go out with him, but he turned her down because he didn't want Rosie to go to the dance alone. When Rosie gives him the okay, he begins dating Bethany and losing his virginity to her to Rosie's disappointment. So at the dance, she losing her virginity in three seconds. Sam suggests they go to school in Boston. He gets accepted into Harvard. She gets accepted into Boston College, but can't go because she finds out she's pregnant with three second's guy kid. She refuses to tell Sam she's pregnant because she's afraid she'll hold him back. But nearly a year later, Bethany who has gone on in life to become a successful model after high school spots her and ends up finding out she's a mother now. She tells Sam and all Sam does is fly backs to surprise her and asks to be the godfather. And this is the movie. She visits Sam in Boston years later and finds out his girlfriend is pregnant. He shames her for being a single mom and brags about his unborn kid having two married parents. In retaliation, she hooks up with three seconds guy who wants to be in their kid's life now five years later because he has abs. She marries him because she want to belong to someone. Yet, at the wedding, she's looking for Sam instead of her groom. Instead of Sam telling her how he feels, he's bum out because he found out that his girlfriend cheated on him and the baby isn't his (which happens to alot of men in real life). He broke up with her the day Rosie married three seconds guy. Her husband ends up booking a hotel suite at one of her hotel chains and gets caught. Now, that part was stupid. But maybe he did so on purpose to get rid of her. Sometimes, when you're tired of being in a relationship, you self-sabotage yourself. She sees Bethany who is now more famous and suggest she visits Sam in New York. Rosie finds a letter where Sam somewhat confessed his feelings after he gets engaged. But by the time Rosie is ready to declare her love for Sam, her flight arrives too late and he's already married to Bethany. Rosie ends up giving the most awkward wedding speeches making it blatantly obvious she's in love with her best friend. You already know they end up together. It's just a series of weird mishaps before it gets to the happy ending.Yet, it was a good movie if you're into romance movies. People mom shamed Lilly Collins in a good way for looking too old to be a high school student but looking too young to be a mom. Umm, most people's bodies start to grey in their thirties but they don't physically change until after their forties. So it is realistic to look the exact same way you did in high school at age 30 with the exception of a few different hairstyles and clothes if one keeps themselves up. Your personal life may be different based on the choices you make in life, but your physical appearance tends to remain the same unless you let yourself go. But I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't One Day or The Notebook. It would have been cuter and stronger maybe if they rekindled later in life and ended up together. But I liked the movie. It was cute and sweet and reminds us sometimes you got to take a chance even if you fear rejection. And maybe you'll find love sooner than wasting years of your life with the wrong person."
" Missed opportunity
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,7,"Many people recommended me this movie as they know I have a soft spot for romcoms as I am quite the romantic myself. But I gotta say, regardless of whether it's trully taken out of the book, this story doesn't know what it wants. It keeps having all this ""based-in-real-life"" events dealing with like unwanted pregnancy or friends unable to express their true feelings until it's too late (especially this one, holy s**t does it take them A LOT of mistakes to realise they just wouldn't be happy until they did), which would have been totally fine but it drags from ""chance"" so much that it becomes some sort of destiny we new since minute one. The way this friends with sexual tension goes is they are friends until they realise they have made just ""some"" mistakes but not like have baby, move in with a girlfriend who he knocks out just to find out he's not the father but now it's too late because Rosie is married.... I mean, unless you want to emotionally destroy the audience who just wants a happy ending between those two but making them go through so much ""baggage"". I'm not a strong catholic or anything but come on, 2 broken weddings in a movie, 2 babies, careers and dreams of young people ruined, the men that are not Alex are all pigs...It's okay if you use the whole ""life pulls them apart and in the end by chance they find themselves in a similar situation so they get together"" but man, this story goes on forever. The main protagonist barely age even though Rosie had, IN THE MOVIE, a baby that grew up to a teenager which it's like almost 15 years and all the characters in this story don't age a day (maybe in the book they do but the movie made no effort in showing it). This is the kind of story that would require more actors and actresses (like in The Notebook, although in a much smaller scale). I'm sorry, I know Lily and Sam are some good looking actors but at the beginning they did not look like they were in... High School, i guess? Even as seniors, I mean, they even try pulling some weird fring hairstyle for Alex but it doesn't do the trick.All I'm saying is, this movie screams Hollywood blockbuster with just two actors so they can ship better their chemistry and whatnot all while, in the back, telling really compelling points about life and all its turns and the missed opportunities that can never be recover (just like how Nicholas Sparks does it only they can keep the happy ending). This story really had some important messages to say to the audience but fell flat on its face because Hollywood just wanted another well-dressed, everyone-is-pretty and all-the-scenes-are-polished movie."
" A chick flick that a guy can enjoy too.
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,9,"As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a ""When Harry Met Sally"" vibe in there, but truly original romcoms are as rare as unicorns. So, it followed was a familiar road. However, this one adds some really funny stuff to the inevitable Hallmark -style conclusion. Is that a spoiler?? If you like the Hallmark stuff you're gonna love this one."
" Don't watch this movie
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,1,This movie made me sick direct attack on my thoughts its bloody confusing and makes no sense. Just typically bad story .
" Comfort viewing
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,5,"There is a lot to like in Love, Rosie including appealing leads who are wonderfully photographed but this is a sub par Four Weddings and a Funeral.Rosie Dunne (Lily Collins) and Alex Stewart (Sam Claflin) have been childhood friends who are meant to be with each other. However Rosie gets pregnant after a one night stand, Alex goes off to Boston to study at Harvard and she does not want to stand in his way. Eventually Alex gets engaged over there and Rosie marries the father to her child.Throughout the film you just want the two main characters to properly talk to each other to clear up any misunderstandings. Instead the film dreams up further silly contrivances to keep Rosie and Alex from hooking up to each other. So they repeatedly have a dalliance with people who are second best.This is an energetic rom-com, amiable enough to watch but it never rises above average."
" Too predictable and too much flaws
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,6,"I don't actually complain about movies or whatsoever, but there few flaws1. How did Greg booked in the same hotel as Rosie was working in2. I think Greg and Alex wore the same jacket I guess or maybe I am wrong.Wasting all those years to hold and tell what you've in your heart was just stupid, relying on other relationships showing too much adult being so screwed up, movies should give lessons to life not to messed up more."
" Quite powerful, if ultimately implausible-looking
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,7,"Male as I am, and fan of many different genres of film, I've always - I must confess - had a bit of a thing for old-fashioned love stories, especially where they involve good-looking people, and most of all where there is impossible or unrequited or Romeo/Juliet type love in there. In such circumstances, the heartstrings can genuinely be pulled and full sympathy evoked.But the snag with Christian Ditter's ""Love, Rosie"" is that NOTHING really stood in the way of Alex (Sam Claflin) and Rosie (a beautiful Lily Collins) being together to whatever extent they wished. At least that's so if one discounts two, let's say, tenets of life that may or may not be cliched rubbish. The first is the idea that at some point somebody can become ""more like a brother/sister"" - conceivably true, but you've only got to see the way these two look at each other to realise they are deeply in love. The second issue resembles what we see in - say - the first part of Jane Eyre, where it becomes clear that the friendship and love that the two characters have is MORE perfect than could be contained in any marriage.Perhaps one or both of these factors apply to Alex and Rosie, so one way or another they keep getting hitched to others in ways that prevent them fully being together - even though at no point are they truly apart either. That looks a bit like having your cake and eating it, and is faintly annoying. Also annoying is the apparent pretence that the virtually-all-British cast are not in Ireland and Dublin - as they clearly are, but somewhere in the UK (of course when they are not in Toronto, pretending to be Boston).Anyway, the film offers many pretty scenes, and many (mostly pretty) people, as well as the force-of-nature, irresistible and overhelming beauty of Collins, whose character is also quite gutsy, as neatly set against the overt sexiness (but ultimately lesser attractions) of parts played with less impact by Tamsin Egerton and Suki Waterhouse.But most of this is actually frustrating, because we probably can't actually buy into the factors of various kinds that keep our star-crossed lovers apart. The biggest question of all would of course be whether they could possibly remain unaware of their love for each other? It seems inconceivable. But then maybe this is indeed a symbiosis that goes even beyond love - one that doesn't actually need constant togetherness and marriage?That would be sort-of beautiful were it to be true, but is it?In spite of it all, this IS a film with romantic power and a certain amount to commend it (including a most welcome ""separate"" performance of warmth and quality from Jaime Winstone as Rosie's best (female) friend and co-worker.)But isn't it just a bit daft somewhere down the line? And all the more so as the makers have to jump through some hoops - and shove various characters aside - in order to FINALLY ensure a happy ending."
" Last scene <3
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,6,"Interesting movie. Most exciting scene is finally Alex knows Rosie loves him more than he thinks. Final meeting scene was so exciting too see kisses and hugs. Everyone should know about the love. Because i think love is like Rosie feels, like Rosie eyes, like Rosie words."
" Maybe Dublin collectively dissociated itself from the project. Who'd blame it?
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,5,"Bad timing is the central theme of this Four Weddings and A Funeral wanna-be, which despite several weddings, a funeral and a cliché ridden script, groans with predictable twists and turns as the two protagonists um and err about their future together"
" An absolute waste of time
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,1,A pale movie about friendship and love which made no sense. Just an amalgamation of bizzare life events.
" See ""Walk to remember"" instead

",2019-04-27 00:00:00,3,"I must admit, I like his smile but that's where it ends. Messed up movie, sorry. Not so romantic after all. If you want to see real chemistry you should see ""Walk in the clouds"" or something similar."
" Amid the bungles, Collins is a bright spark.
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,5,"Never before has one script screamed so loudly for a Carrie Fisher rewrite; anything at all to inject a little wit, decency or soul."
" Boring
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,4,"This was pretty bad. I like the leads but they really should have picked a different movie to be in. I get it, it's a romance movie and romance movies are usually pretty predictable. Unfortunately, this is both predictable and boring. You know the main characters aren't getting together until the end so every increasingly insane situation that keeps them apart becomes more and more boring and oddly predictable. By the end of the movie they didn't even deserve to be happy together after everything they had done."
" Miserable and disgustingly non-romantic
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,1,"If you want to watch film where the two leads have no depth of character and just make shallow choices, then this is the film for you. The plot meanders joylessly and slowly declines into a predictably 'happy' outcome. Terrible messages without any substance, depth, romance or fun. Save yourself from this tragedy of a film."
" In love with this film, top 1 of my romance favs
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,10,"I just love how lily and Sam connect. All the romance, comedy and passion looked so effortless. An the plot... its refreshing; not the typical meet the guy, fall in love, break up, and marry. Watch it, I'm sure you won't regret it."

" Love this movie
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,10,"Very lovely, moving movie.
It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I found it to be a funny, romantic teen/but not teen movie. It dealt with more adult issues rather than your normal teen movie.
I think it's definitely worth a watch."
" Surprisingly good

" Cute movie!
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,10,"I thought this was such a cute movie! It kept me hooked the whole time and the main characters had great chemistry, which makes any movie even better. I'd watch again!"
" An exaggerated story which lacks emotion
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,6,"Rosie and Alex are best friends since they were children, thus they spend plenty of time together and speak about everything. Although they decide to go to Boston together to study, their paths get separated by an accident, event which will influence their lives form there on.It's a movie which tryies to present a love story which apperently isn't meant to be and follows the footsteps of each of the two protagonists as they seek happiness, each using his own approach. The plot seems simple and it mostly is, being a bit predictable and linear most of the time, with a few exceptions. It tries to involve the viewer into its story which should generate plenty of drama and laughter along the way, but as far as I'm concerned, it wasn't able to. It tends to exaggerate in many ways, to present situations which simply aren't necessary or don't bring anything to the outcome. It has a couple of great characters, I have to give it credit for that, but as good as they may be or as well as they are played by their actors, they weren't able to generate enough emotion for the viewer to be able to actually emphasize with them, fact which is quite a shame.It has an annoying way of introducing new elements out of nowhere, generating problems in the same way but also solving them in a blink of an eye. As a result, it's quite hard to believe what's going on and especially the drama that's implied. Another thing worth mentioning here, although you might find it a bit personal and subjective, is the fact that the movie bases its story on a very far fatched intrigue which you either take as it is and try to go with it, or find yourself in my situation in which you find it even harder to take things seriously. I know it's supposed to be a comedy but it wasn't even funny. One or two laughs here and there and that's about it. Even if you treat it as a romance, you won't find a better movie. It would have worked a lot better as a drama, given the fact that it had a better plot on which to build it.As you might have guessed by now, I was left pretty disappointed by this film. It had potential, it had two good actors as protagonists which I enjoy watching regardless of film, but it wasn't able to bring a plot good enough to link it all together. Its superficial intrigue, its predictable nature and its bad habit of bringing and solving issues out of a sudden simply spoils the overall experience."
" Unlike any ordinary romcom film!
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,8,"This film isn't just an ordinary romcom film that a majority of people may imagine. This one has a beautiful story and just the right amount of comedy that lights up the film. It is unlike any other movie in the same genre that I have watched. At one point the movie has me trying hard to hold back tears, and then the next its making me smile and laugh.In the movie, they keep missing each other .....again and again and again!
It really got me impatient at one point but that is also the beauty of this film and it makes the ending special:)"
" FAVOURITE MOVIE

" Gorgeous movie, was sorry when it ended!
",2018-12-20 00:00:00,10,"I'm a bit tired of reading reviews dominated by people that want to overthink and scrutinise every single little detail. Not every movie needs to be deep and thought provoking to be enjoyable, life is intense enough as it is, live a little.The two leads in this movie had good chemistry and I found myself really batting for them along the way. I laughed in parts, got teary in parts and found myself smiling right to the very end and was sorry when it finished.I loved every minute of this movie. It was pure, feel good escapism which was just what I needed today, haters are going to hate I guess but take this movie for what it is, relax and enjoy."

" Light Romantic Movie
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,5,"Very light, and as if the same problem is repeated in a different scenario everytime Rosie and Alex wants to be together.

" A Great Romantic Comedy
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,10,"Many romantic movies are often stereotyped as ""corny"" or unrealistic portrayals of love and life. Life is a series of spontaneous moments, difficult choices, and countless hardships. The film directed by Christian Ditter, ""Love, Rosie"" portrays growing up and experiencing heartbreaks, happiness, and sacrifices that may occur in life, through the ""semi-tragic"" love story of childhood best friends. Sam Claflin and Lily Collins play the roles of Alex and Rosie, whom are childhood best friends that are unexpectedly pushed into adulthood. Throughout the movie, we watch their individual struggles and the development of their relationship over time. When their friendship turns into attraction, they are faced with a series of miscommunications, decisions, and dilemmas that prevent them from being with each other taking the viewer on an emotional rollercoaster. ""Love, Rosie"" succeeded in showcasing the complexity of human relationships and the reality of growing up.
 I would like to think that I am a romantic, who is a sucker for all the corny and cheesy unrealistic scenarios that occur in typical romance movies. However, this movie is my favorite romantic film because unlike those other typical romantic movies, I felt that I could relate to the characters and the events or circumstances that occur in the movie. Throughout my life, I have watched countless numbers of romance and romantic comedy movies. I used to stay up late at night, just watching movies. One night, Love, Rosie came up and after reading the synopsis I decided to watch it online for free. All the other romantic movies that I have ever watched before or after, has never been able to make me lose myself while watching it. I could relate to some of the events that the characters were experiencing and it was real for me. The film appeals to your emotions with the wittiness, personable characters and the young love that they are pursuing. In addition, lessons about life, chasing your dreams, and experiencing hardship were all meticulously woven into the storyline of a ""semi-tragic"" romance. 
 This film will make you laugh, smile, and cry. For me, it hit home. I honestly cried five different times all throughout the movie. The story begins with a huge miscommunication between Alex and Rosie, leading to the series of events that follow throughout the movie. I was brought to tears every time they missed their chance because the timing was not right or something popped up that made it seem impossible for them to be together. It also pulled at my heartstrings because they love each other and they should be together, but they both think that their feelings are not reciprocated by the other. It is an accurate representation of the complications and miscommunications that can alter any relationship. The plot really emphasizes the complexity of human relationships, through the development of Alex and Rosie's young childhood friendship. 
 Life is almost never perfect. Over the course of a lifetime, there are bound to be hardships or tough situations that you may encounter. This movie portrays this well but also showcases the idea that sometimes in life you take a longer, harder path to reach the same destination. I think this movie highlights the struggles and dilemmas that may arise during growing up and becoming an adult. As well as showcases the unpredictability and spontaneousness of life and love. From this movie, I learned that life will throw anything at you, but it is important to embrace these obstacles because in the end everything will be okay one way or another. Great movies, are the ones that can make you reflect or affect people to feel something whether it be with humor, drama or romance. Overall, I strongly believe that Love, Rosie is a movie worth taking the time to watch. I highly suggest this movie if you are looking for a good cry or a just a good movie to watch. You will love it!!!"
" A nice comedy about love and destiny
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,7,"A nice movie, easy and funny, romantic, perfect to watch in the winter evenings if you want to feel a little bit of sweetness. 
The story is about a woman and a man who loves each other since childhood, however they never catch the right moment to express and live their love. Their lives take two different roads but they always remain in touch, never forgetting their special connection. 
I liked the actors and the film plot, it is a good way to relax and have a nice time."
" If you are falling in love with your bestest friend, please watch this film. Or even you aren't, you still have to watch this too!
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,9,"Love, Rosie is a beautiful movie. I do love the storyline, the plot, the dialogue and everything. They are just fit perfectly in place. Lily is a perfect Rosie and Sam is the best Alex. Every situation, every scene, every coincidence in the movie just remind me of our real life. We can't expect everything to be like we want it to be. You can't push your crush to another girl because you think that he has been your friends since you were young, so 'he has to be your best friends forever' 
 This movie teaches me so many things like 'If you never ask, the answer will always be no' Sometimes said something out loud is better than left it unsaid. At least you had a chance to say it out. Whether it ends in a good way or a bad way, it was experience.
 If you are the sensitive person, this movie will be the reason for teardrops on your cheeks. I was crying during many scenes, they are so touchy. I can't describe those feelings into the words for 100 percent. Go watching this staggering film by yourself and you will honestly, completely, truly understand me :)
Love, Rannaree"
" Nice movie
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,9,"It's frustrating that they know each feelings but it doesn't work to be together. I know how frustrating that feeling is. When i realize i wanna tell my feelings to someone, she or he already has gone somehow not only in lovely relationship but also close relationship like frinds or grandparents. I can't tell my feelings anymore. This movie expresses that misery or sadness."
" Lovely Rose..

" The only reason I was able to stomach this, was because I attempted watching First Daughter before
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,3,"Yes, that's correct, the only reason I was able to stomach this vomit of a plot, was my frail attempt at watching First Daughter and stopping at the Pool Scene. 
In comparison, this movie spearheaded by the lovely Lily Collins was a treat but not deserving anything more than 3 stars."
" Believable love story with unbelievable parts
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,7,"I remembered seeing a trailer for this film on YouTube; didn't interest me, but I remembered the poster standing out. And after watching Hunger Games, I was interested in seeing more Sam Claflin films, so I put it in my mental list.Story: Best friends Rosie and Alex go their separate ways after secondary school, with Alex moving to America and Rosie accidentally becoming pregnant after prom night. As the years go by, Rose and Alex gamble everything to keep their friendship alive, while love also springs between them.Good set up, good cast. Overall I enjoyed it, and my favourite part was definitely Lily Collins and Sam Claflin's chemistry. I thought it was believable how they transitioned from best friends to being in love at the end, even if a few scenes felt pointless. I also enjoyed the friendship between Rosie and her friend Ruby. I liked the supporting characters Sally and Bethany. I thought the pacing was fine, I wasn't bored at all watching it.I have negatives of course so 1) the fact that they don't age. I get it since two attractive people have been cast in the roles and they probably don't want to recast them. But seriously, Rosie's daughter is 14 or 15 years old by the end, and they look like sisters. Age up your actors; it's distracting. Keeps reminding me of the McAvoy/Fassbender X-Men films; Age for crying out loud! I mean a lot times you'd probably forget that since Collins and Claflin have such great chemistry, but once they stop talking to each other it becomes distracting again.Also, there is one completely cartoon character: Greg, Rosie's baby daddy and later husband. If Greg exists in the books and is accurate to the book character; fair enough. But it was the laziest way to portray a deadbeat. There's a scene where Rosie and Alex are at Rosie's dad's funeral; it's raining and tries to portray itself as a serious seen. But, Greg straight up walks up to the two, puts on his glasses, acting like he's at a party and goofing around. What!?? Is the script so desperate to portray Greg as a douche, they had to resort to that. Who ok'd that. If you need a scene like that, don't put it in a funeral scene.I enjoy romantic films when I'm in the mood, and apart from those few distracting elements, I enjoyed the film. I'd recommend it, just watch out for those things I've mentioned."
" Alex is the man that all girls dream of
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,7,"First, I am not a type of person who love drama so much. I am just a fan of horror , thriller and based on true story but this movie attract me with trailer but I saw the trailer in 2018 and I wonder why none of my friends (who are movie fans) not recommend this movie to watch this. This is more better than Me Before You movie!"
" Love, Rosie and When Harry met Sally: normalcy and making a film relatable
",2018-02-22 00:00:00,9,"When I finished watching this film last night I had tears down my face and was helpless to my own pondering about what this film was showing. The last time I was so invested in characters in a Rom-Com was ""when Harry met Sally"" but even though the film was not as artistically proficient, it still impacted me on a far greater level. Needless to say that I experienced ""love, Rosie"" in a vastly different way to professional film critics, one of whom said:
""Do you really want to expose your adolescent daughter to 100 minutes of the beautiful Lily Collins accepting second-best, over and over and over and over and over and over and over again?""
The reality is that we do, especially as adolescents, experience just this. The premise of the film is simple and yet also a little unoriginal. Rosie and Alex are best friends from childhood but they fail to see the chemistry between them. It takes them 15 years from the point they leave sixth form college to realise they have been looking for one another all that time. So far so ""when Harry met Sally"" but where these two films diverge, and where my interest was piqued, was how the film sets this up. When Harry actually meets Sally, they part ways, return and then part ways again. The third meeting is the lucky one and they build their friendship to love. The story evolves around these two figures slowly building a relationship that gains depth neither expected. The key theme is how love is most stable when built upon friendship.Love, Rosie, on the other hand, focuses on relationships, and that we often choose poorly. It begins with a run through of Rosie and Alex through childhood, establishing their chemistry through how the characters speak to one another, their body language around each other, and how they react to their choices of lovers. They are already friends, so the film instead challenges them by keeping their love apart by their own choices. To push my point home there is a scene at the start where Alex is contemplating who to take to the end of year school dance; will he choose Bethany or Rosie. This is a form of foreshadowing, but also reveals how these two characters interact. Rosie's tone shows she is hurt that he is making this choice so she tells him that she has been asked by ""the hottest guy in the year"" (the narcissistic Greg) to the dance. Neither chooses each other and it is clear that Rosie dislikes this (note that the film is from her perspective), even though she says nothing about it until at least an hour into the film. The point of this is that we see immediately that these two characters know each other, have done for a long time, and are interesting in one another but lack the courage to pursue their feelings. A contrasting scene in when Harry met Sally is the day ""date"" they have, enjoying New York, which concludes with Harry asking Sally to the cinema to find she is already going on the date; this sequence is one where they get to know each other, which contrasts with the already established friendship of Rosie and Alex. This is a highly different dynamic.""Love, Rosie"" focuses on a romance that is convincing consequently, for the dual reason that their friendship is convincing and realistic, and that Rosie and Alex are both very flawed characters; they are truly 3-dimensional characters because they are imperfect and make bad decisions throughout the story. These decisions are relatable too; they experience romances that go wrong or have tough times due to conflicts of character or difficult events. I can't really go further without spoiling major plot points and I've done my best to keep the review as spoiler-free as I can, but I will say that I knew the events intimately for their realism and made the film hard to watch. The story told is essentially a film of normal life, by which I mean that the events of the film are events we have all experienced in some way either directly or second-hand. In contrast to the tried and tested plot the story is highly original due to its reliance on normalcy.We often watch films for escapism, to endulge in the ridiculousness of cinema; Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, the Martian, Inception, all these films have high stakes that we enjoy for the thrill of catharsis. Even Rom-Coms have this streak of the abnormal from the myriad of hollywood love stories in Love Actually to even the handsome stranger cliche of Colin Firth's character in Bridget Jones's Diary, we are shown love stories of sunlight and roses, of mistakes but a resolution within days or even weeks. ""When Harry met Sally"" crafts a wonderful picture of two great characters slowly falling in love, but their other love interests are left to the side and unshown. ""Love, Rosie"" shows these failed loves, and also shows how both Rosie and Alex repeatedly make the same mistake bringing home a relatable lesson; love does not come quickly, but sometimes it is found where it has been infront of your eyes all along.Yet there is still more to this. We sometimes look for clever cinema that makes us think about ideas complex in philosophy or morality. I've lost count of the number of people who have finished inception and told me they want to know if the spinning top finished spinning. The bottom line is that this is only a superficial question that is put to the side when you realise the answer doesn't matter beyond the context of the film. What I discovered upon finishing ""Love, Rosie"" is that it is really the problems and realities of life that make us think. A flawed and imperfect life is the most normal thing for us, and this film captures the charm in the imperfection, challenging us to think introspectively about our own lives and love experiences.Sorry about the long and rambling review. This film made me think more than I expected. THe key point is watch this film. It is charming, funny and very relatable."
" Love, Nice film
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,10,"I watch the whole movie without knowing that's from a really nice novel; therefore, it has a simple storyline but the power it made is really fantastic and in a few moment, I nearly can feel as precisely as the two main characters did, mostly the actress although I'm a guy, haha. After all, we should...ur...no, we must pursue our dreams especially our love with the best effort, the time, once it's gone, will never come back, that's how real life, as well as such film, taught me."
" Cute
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,5,Cute little movie that was genuine and funny and lowkey heartbreaking
" Weak
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,3,"How anyone can find this movie romantic is beyond me (this is coming form a female of the intended demographic). It is your typical vapid shallow superficial Hollywood take on love, without having any of the sheen, glamour and high production quality of a Hollywood rom com. Therefore, it falls flat and is very tedious and hard to watch. Not only is it completely unfunny, disjointed and filled with unnecessary profanity, it is also implausible. Surely the fact that Alex always chose some other girl before Rosie meant that he didn't really like her all that much and therefore could not be so in love with her for so long. I know that is how it works in that little land called reality. Therefore. I could never truly buy into this 'love story' if you can even call it that, although love montage would be more suitable. I also do not care for the actor who played Alex much. He doesn't possess a leading man quality and was not convincing in this role. Romance must truly be dead in this day in age if this is what people consider to be romantic."
" The movie is about two childhood-friends that always got separated. When it comes to love, there always has been something in their way.
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,9,"I just rediscovered this movie after almost 4 years and can I just say, I fell in love with it and I still am.This movie is absolutely worth-watching in my opinion, because it has a nice plot line with some twisted turns. Even though the movie is filled with romantic clichés,some jokes included and also not everything happens like you would think it will. Both leading actors did an amazing job and they have great on-screen chemistry. You really get the feeling like they would have known each other for years. The casting was absolutely successful.In conclusion I can say, that it is a movie that has some typical scenes for a romantic movie, but also some unexpected turns and the whole story of the friendship-love is beautiful to watch. It did so good, watching this movie on a Saturday evening to find calmness. It is a movie, where you start crying, laughing and smiling."
" Rosie and Alex keep holding on to their friendship, even though they're miles apart from each other.
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,10,"Love Rosie. The story of two young souls begins and ends. Two teenage best friends, Rosie Dunne (Lily Collins) and Alex Stewart (Sam Claflin) is in denial about the love between them. The film was magical, everything anyone would dream about. Personally, it's breathtaking and relatable. The movie is adapted from the book Where Rainbows End by Cecelia Ahern. It is a 102 minutes movie it is not that long and not that short for a movie. It was released at October 22, 2014 (United Kingdom) and directed by Christian Ditter. The movie was amazing, how it can captures everything. The content of the movie is just compelling and somehow it makes me think as an audience, ""What if I end up like them, that the right person was right in front of me all along?"" Love Rosie might not be relatable to everyone in real life, but the way they make it, it makes me believe that the movie is myself being pictured. It is kind of pathetic, their love story. You can either see it as exciting and annoyed or boring. How Alex kept looking for beautiful perfect girl you could ever seen and at last you ends up with your best friend which may be just enough for him. He could've just say you love your best friend, instead of flying across countries to look for a better one when you're not going to find any. Finally, they end up being jealous of one and another, but worried at the same time because of their feelings. Somehow, in my opinion that what makes it interesting because it is so true in so many level.I enjoy the part where Alex got married then he have this dancing part, where Rosie's child was having the same problem like what Alex and Rosie have but the difference is that now Alex knows and wants her to feel like it is okay to fall in love with your best friend. That part of the plot breaks my heart. In the other hand I don't enjoy much where Rosie made a stupid mistake about marrying Greg because it just don't make sense, but at the same time it was the one thing that makes the movie or appealing at some point. Overall the movie is pretty sensitive and I never seen anything as good as this movie apparently. Lily Collins and Sam Claflins is definitely a perfect match to the role, but can't really tell for sure since I don't read the book but it was so perfect that they are able to make me feel like what they feel. I watched so many romance drama movies and nothing seemed to be better or slightly under either. I learned a lot after watching this, how we can't take others for granted."
" I just LOVED Love, Rosie great chick flick brilliant
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,10,"I loved this just the ticket for those days when you feel really stressed over life and you spend 1hr 40mins, laughing, crying, laughing and crying, and just totally enjoying a wonderful romantic film. OK yes predictable but who cares. It was a great British movie with good actors, and great scenery, a bit of England, America, sad bits, laughter bits, omg i nearly wet myself at the beginning and the condom it was so funny and sort of sad at the same time. To bring the guy in from the lift at the end was priceless lol. One of my favorite movies and I will watch it again. I think people expect way too much of movies just enjoy it for what it is, a bit of escapism. At least it wasn't full of sex and violence."
" Nice Movie
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,7,"A really great movie about how two young adults who are best-friends, but from the inside love each other. Also this movie is based on a novel, I don't know weather the novel was better than the movie (cause I haven't read the novel), but still the movie keeps you wondering how it's gonna end (happy or sad) which is great."
" A heartfelt, sincere romantic drama comedy film
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,10,"This is my first review here so bear with me. As I'm sure most of you know, this movie is based on a novel Where rainbows end by Cecilia Ahern. It is just loosely based on it, because the story differs somewhat. I won't reveal anything else, to avoid spoilers. All I'll say is that it works because it captures the essence of the book. The chemistry between the two main actors is unbelievably good and the supporting cast is good as well. I warmly recommend this film to everybody. How probable the plot, that is up to a viewer to decide. It was for me. If you're a hopeless romantic, you're gonna enjoy this one. If you're a realist, you're probably gonna find certain situations a bit too much and out there. Nonetheless I left the theater with a smile on my face. The movie makes you believe that anything is possible and that one should never give up on hope."
" Excellent movie
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,8,"I am absolutely amazed with this film. This is definitely not one of the ""typical American love story"" that are nowadays too popular. Of course, there are some standard things that must appear in the genre of these films, but it is obvious that they really made an effort. During the film, you can be surprised with unexpected events that are actually much more realistic than in the standard romantic movies. The trail of missed opportunities, which is constantly repeated in this film, keeps viewers under some kind of tension, or so it seemed to me. As a matter of fact, I'm not a huge fan of romantic drama, because they put lots of unnecessary events and drama in the film, but this movie, I would definitely recommend anyone who likes movies that bounce from other films."
" Ignore the bad reviews, Your will love it !!
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,10,"I do not usually write reviews but these hating reviews got me into that :D I don't get all the people complaining about how predictable this movie was. God damn it if you want some unpredictable ending go watch ""shutter island"" or ""mulholland drive"" or something that SAYS that it is a freaking THRILLER!!. This movie is a ""Romantic Comedy"" and it is just like ""Pretty Woman"", ""10 Things I hate about you"" or ""say anything"" - The movies we loved, even if they were predictable. The point is, its not about the ending, its about living in between the movie; desperately wanting for them to recognize love and chanting for there friendship and adoring their silly fights and commitments. For all those who just want to enjoy there weekend by watching a beautiful romantic movie and smile I recommend them to do watch this and ignore all the hate and bad reviews. Have fun :)"
" One of the best romance movie
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,8,"The movie is about a story of best friends who move away after school, but after years, they realize that they both miss their friendship. They find out that they still like each other communicate again, until one day they meet again on the boy's wedding day. It's a really good movie to watch, when you start, you can't stop anymore, you get curious about what is going to happen, if they are going to be together or not. It's a quiet movie, to relax your mind, but really exciting!"
" Hate/Loved it

" beautiful pairing in clunky romance
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,5,"Rosie Dunne (Lily Collins) and Alex Stewart (Sam Claflin) have been friends since 5 years old. Her life is changing at 30. In flashback starting with her 18th birthday, their relationship is shown as they go on their separate journeys. He loses his virginity to Bethany Williams (Suki Waterhouse) which drives Rosie to self-obsessed Greg (Christian Cooke). Alex goes off to Harvard and finds new girlfriend Sally (Tamsin Egerton). Rosie gets unexpected pregnant from her one awkward night with Greg which derails her plans to study in Boston near Alex.Lily Collins is lovely. Sam Claflin has his boyish charms. This romance could be better. Despite the beautiful pairing, it never really pulls it off completely. It has a fun start. The condom bit is hilarious. There is a way for this relationship to go to develop a great epic romance. It takes odd turns which really throws it off. By the second half, I don't want them to get together. Quite frankly, none of the men are good enough for her. This should really be Rosie's story. Lily Collins is good enough to pull that off."
